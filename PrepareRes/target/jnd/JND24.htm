		CHAPTERS 1-13
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is seldom that a chapter of the word is so isolated that we can give the exposition of it without taking account of the connection with what precedes and what follows.<a name=1:1></a> There are some which contain a single subject developed enough for us to be able to consider it separately.<a name=1:2></a> Sometimes, even a single verse presents some feature of the precious Saviour which may supply matter for meditation during many blessed hours But to unfold the ideas which are presented in a chapter, it is always necessary to consider it in relation to those things with which, according to the intention of the Spirit, it is connected.<a name=1:3></a> This is what I shall endeavour to do with regard to the chapter before us.<a name=1:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This Gospel may be called the gospel of the kingdom.<a name=1:5></a> That is, it relates the history and discourses of Christ, specially with a view to the establishment of the kingdom of heaven.<a name=1:6></a> This thirteenth chapter reveals to us the mysteries of the kingdom.<a name=1:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us consider the position in which the revelation of the kingdom was found when the Lord pronounced it; in other words, what were its relations to the Jewish people at that time.<a name=1:8></a> With this object, let us review a little the contents of this Gospel.<a name=1:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first chapter we find, after the plan of Genesis, Numbers and Chronicles, the genealogy of the royal family, and the two great stems with which the promises were bound up, and from which Christ descended: David and Abraham.<a name=1:10></a> The promises were made to the seed of each.<a name=1:11></a> The miraculous conception of Jesus, according to the predictions of scripture, is then related.<a name=1:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next, in the second chapter, we are told of this royal birth (a subject of alarm to Herod, who was in the enjoyment of the Jewish royalty), as well as of testimony and joy to the ends of the earth; the flight of Jesus into Egypt and His return; and in all these circumstances the fulfilment of the prophecies is established.<a name=1:13></a>

	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#1:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>[The first part of these notes was originally given as an exposition of Matthew 13, and was so published, translated from the French. But, as even here the exposition gives a general sketch of the preceding chapters, and as I am enabled to add a version of the notes on the chapters which follow, I have ventured so to modify the title as to suit the paper as a whole. The early part dwells only on chapter 13. -- Ed.]

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the following chapter (3) the approach of the kingdom of heaven is announced.<a name=2:1></a> The prophet warns the people of the wrath to come, from which it was necessary to flee; of the axe which was laid to the root of the trees; then he announces that God was seeking fruits, and that it would be useless to boast of being a child of Abraham, if one produced none.<a name=2:2></a> Jesus subjects Himself to the condition of the Jews and receives at the same time the testimony that He is the Son of God.<a name=2:3></a> His subjection and humiliation, and the testimony thereupon rendered, and rendered to Himself respecting the glory of His person, are here profoundly instructive.<a name=2:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 4, Jesus, thus identified in humiliation with the Jews, and owned as the Son of God by the Father, undergoes the temptation of the enemy who must be conquered and bound, as the strong man, if one would spoil his goods; a temptation suited to the circumstances in which the Messiah stood.<a name=2:5></a> Satan seeks to turn the Lord aside from the path of obedience, by urging Him to make use of His glory, or to take it according to His will, and as being Himself in subjection to Satan; by His natural wants, as hunger; by His privileges, that is to say, the promises which had been made to Him (His Jewish privileges or those of Messiah, according to Psalm 91); and by glory in the world, a glory indeed which He will really possess as the gift of God hereafter, even "all the kingdoms of the world"; and all this by prevailing upon Him to deviate from the path of obedience on which He had entered.<a name=2:6></a> But in vain.<a name=2:7></a> Then Jesus begins, after John is put in prison, to preach the approach of the kingdom, His abode in the place described in Isaiah 9 giving place to the foretold difference between the last afflictions of the Jews and all those which preceded the manifestation of the light of Messiah.<a name=2:8></a><a href="#2:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> He preaches the gospel of the kingdom and confirms His doctrine, and gives testimony to the glorious truth of His presence, by miracles of goodness which announced the visitation of the God of Israel.<a name=2:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#2:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>When Satan cannot prevail to withdraw the believer from the path of obedience, he begins to act upon his adversaries, and to excite them to opposition and persecution. Jesus retreats before this rejection thus began, and hence becomes the centre of light and blessing, in the midst of the distress of Israel, according to the passage quoted.

	<div class="paragraph">
		Having thus attracted the attention of the multitudes, He unfolds the principles of the kingdom and the effect of the testimony which was to be rendered to Him (chapters 5-7) Observe, there is no question here about redemption.<a name=3:1></a> There is the spirituality of many parts of the law, or rather the application made by Jesus of His ordinances to the heart as well as to acts, and the introduction of the name of the Father as the motive, principle and rule of conduct.<a name=3:2></a> Israel is here, as it were, on the way, in danger of being given up to the judge if he agrees not with his adversary.<a name=3:3></a> It is the light of heaven which shines on the conduct of men, by means of Him who came from heaven.<a name=3:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 8, before the historical dealings with Israel, we have an introductory display of the power come in and its effects.<a name=3:5></a> It was Jehovah cleansing the leper or leprosy in Israel, and sending the cleansed one to the priests.<a name=3:6></a> It was, since it was Jehovah, that which reached in power over the limits of Israel and shewed that, while Gentiles would come in from east and west, the children of the kingdom would be thrust out.<a name=3:7></a> Next He was come down in gracious participation in all their sorrows and infirmities; but hence withal, having no place amongst men; but in the midst of the tossings and heavings through which those who were content to identify themselves with this rejected One for His own sake must pass, they were secure by that very fact in all, in the same boat with Him who <i>was</i> there in divine power and counsels, however low He might be come.<a name=3:8></a> This was the place of the remnant.<a name=3:9></a> As to the others, they would turn Him away; but Israel, left to the power of Satan, would rush as unclean headlong to destruction.<a name=3:10></a> Such is the whole history of the coming of Messiah, Jehovah, Jesus.<a name=3:11></a> Note here, we have not the demoniac sent back to tell of the power which had healed him.<a name=3:12></a> For it is the ministry of the Lord which is pointed out, and its course, reception and effect.<a name=3:13></a> Hence this is the connection of these events in order to present the history of the Lord's presenting Himself.<a name=3:14></a> It is in a certain sense complete in itself.<a name=3:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 9 He continues to labour personally in the ministry of the kingdom.<a name=3:16></a> Acknowledged as the Son of David by the blind men, and received by the multitudes with admiration, He is accused by the jealousy of the Pharisees of casting out devils by the prince of the devils; but the time of grace towards this poor people was not yet over.<a name=3:17></a> When Jesus sees the multitudes, He has compassion upon them; they were as sheep without a shepherd.<a name=3:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 10, as the Lord of the vineyard, He sends His disciples to "the lost sheep of the house of Israel," to declare to them that the kingdom was at hand; a prefiguration (so to speak) of the transmission of this ministry to His disciples, when He should have been Himself rejected.<a name=4:1></a> But there is no question of any but Israel.<a name=4:2></a> They were not to go into the way of the Gentiles.<a name=4:3></a> Nevertheless, on account of this general mission, the Lord, in His directions and encouragements, expresses Himself in a manner which might serve them as a guide in all circumstances wherein they might be found, whether in their actual mission, or during His absence from the earth: still, He regards their mission simply as a mission to Israel, whether then, or even at the last times.<a name=4:4></a> They were not to have gone over the cities of Israel till the Son of man should have come.<a name=4:5></a> The capture of Jerusalem has deferred that event until God resumes His labours towards Israel.<a name=4:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord, resuming His labours of love, recounts, on the occasion of the arrival of the disciples of John, all the history of that work among the Jews (chapter 11).<a name=4:7></a> John Baptist, himself, takes the place of a disciple instead of that of a prophet, and the Lord bears testimony to him, instead of receiving testimony from him.<a name=4:8></a> The kingdom of heaven, instead of being established in power, being rejected, is invaded by violence only, in defiance of difficulties and the opposition of men; for the Jews, whether one had lamented or piped to them, had not responded to the testimony of God.<a name=4:9></a> The rejection of Jesus, a rejection which He accepts with entire submission, is explained by this: only the Father could know the Son, and only the Son could reveal the Father.<a name=4:10></a> The Messiah disappears, so to speak, in His glory too pure for man to receive.<a name=4:11></a> But grace only springs up in greater abundance, <i>and all things having been delivered to the Son</i>, it is no longer a question about the Messiah of the Jews.<a name=4:12></a> He invites all those who are "weary and heavy laden" to come to Him.<a name=4:13></a> It is a chapter of the highest interest.<a name=4:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hereupon in chapter 12 the Lord breaks with the Jews decidedly.<a name=4:15></a> He is Lord of the sabbath given as a sign of the covenant with them, the Lord in grace, but still Lord.<a name=4:16></a> The Pharisees seek to kill Him.<a name=4:17></a> He hides Himself, and the light of the Gentiles begins to dawn in the testimony of God.<a name=4:18></a> Acknowledged anew by an astonished people as the Son of David, the Pharisees put the seal to their iniquity and their condemnation, in again attributing His works to the power of the prince of the devils.<a name=4:19></a> Thereupon Jesus pronounces their judgment: the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost is not pardoned.<a name=4:20></a> The sign asked for by the perverse generation is refused them: there shall no other sign be given them than the sign of the prophet Jonas.<a name=4:21></a> Even the people of Nineveh and the queen of the South shall condemn them, and at last the unclean spirit that had gone out of the people shall return into them with other more wicked spirits, and its last state shall be worse than the first.<a name=4:22></a><a href="#4:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> Such will be the end of the generation that rejected the Saviour.<a name=4:23></a> Thereupon He renounces the ties of nature which connected Him, as the Messiah after the flesh, with this people, and acknowledges no other relationship than obedience to His Father.<a name=4:24></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This rapid sketch of the contents of these twelve chapters of the precious revelation of God will shew us the importance of the position of chapter 13, at which we are now arrived, and which is to occupy us more particularly.<a name=5:1></a> It is based on the rejection of the Son of man, the Messiah, by the self-righteousness of Israel; and, in fact, on the judgment passed on the latter in consequence of this rejection of the Heir of the promises.<a name=5:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Wherefore, addressing Himself the same day to the multitudes, Jesus appears as no more seeking fruit.<a name=5:3></a> It was no longer a question of His vine or His fig-tree.<a name=5:4></a> He sows -- He is a sower.<a name=5:5></a> He finds nothing: He brings with Him that which by His grace may spring and produce fruit.<a name=5:6></a> He fully distinguishes His disciples; to them it is given to understand the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, which is not granted to the multitudes whose heart is made fat.<a name=5:7></a> He speaks to them in parables -- a precious light for the remnant led of God; darkness to the people led of their own blindness.<a name=5:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here, then, the Lord takes the place of a sower, and the word falls, here and there, on every kind of ground.<a name=5:9></a> But, having taken this character, it is no longer a question about the Jews merely (there one would have sought fruit), but, in principle, about every hearer of the word.<a name=5:10></a> However, we have not here the unity of the church, the body of Christ, in heaven, but His work on earth; and then, after that, the forms which the kingdom and the judgment connected with it, on the earth, should take.<a name=5:11></a> I would not say that the consequences of that would not go further, but herein is contained the subject of this chapter.<a name=5:12></a> It was sowing time, because there was nothing.<a name=5:13></a> Every individual that heard bore fruit according to the nature of the ground where the seed fell.<a name=5:14></a> For here we have, not the secrets of the efficacy of the grace of God, but the responsibility of man, and the outward effects that would follow in consequence of the work wrought in this world.<a name=5:15></a> Thus the word was "the word of the kingdom," -- the testimony borne to the rights of Christ by the grace of God -- the proclamation of the establishment of the authority of God on the earth -- in grace it might be, but still requiring the subjection of man.<a name=5:16></a> The kingdom thus proclaimed had a moral character, because it was the kingdom of God, having precious promises and a security which was beyond all price.<a name=5:17></a> But it was, at the same time, the kingdom of the heavens whose authority was to be established over the earth, the government of God here below, and His work in respect of this government; and not the church united to Christ in heaven.<a name=5:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Still, in this first parable the Lord does not present a similitude of the kingdom of the heavens, although the word was "the word of the kingdom," because here the question is not about the effects and results of the seed generally, under the government of God, but about the fact of the sowing and the individual result, according to the ground where the seed fell.<a name=6:1></a> As far as the work of the sower was concerned, it was an affair of individuals.<a name=6:2></a> The result would be a whole, which would indeed require a work of separation, but which was nevertheless meanwhile a whole.<a name=6:3></a> The work did not adopt the Jewish corporality as its- ground; it did not acknowledge the ancient vineyard.<a name=6:4></a> A sower sowed, and each grain, so to speak, had such or such an effect in the heart where it fell.<a name=6:5></a> Herein there was an important point in the work, or in the preaching of the kingdom; individuality and individual responsibility.<a name=6:6></a><a href="#6:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> This was a principle, moreover, always true, but which the work itself brought out, -- which was at the root of the work, because <i>God</i> and <i>man</i> were fully manifested.<a name=6:7></a> It was not merely a question about the government of a people; but the first principle, the basis of Christianity, was to be that each one should bear his own burden.<a name=6:8></a> Grace unites those who have received this seed with good effect, for the life is common and the Spirit is one.<a name=6:9></a> Still, each one receives for himself, and cannot withdraw himself from his own responsibility in that respect; a responsibility which has reference, not only to his moral conduct as a man, but to the reception of the testimony which the activity of the love of God comes to scatter, like seed among men, upon the heart.<a name=6:10></a> The principle of individual responsibility was ever true for the purpose of eternal judgment, and must be so if God is judge!<a name=6:11></a> He will judge every man; nevertheless, it was not the principle on which the Jewish system was based here below; but, after the rejection of the Messiah by this people, this principle was brought out, and connected itself with the only thing which remained as a ground of relationship between God and man; namely, the testimony of His love and the revelation of His claims upon the heart.<a name=6:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#6:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>It is a principle which Popery completely destroys, by putting the church and the acknowledgment of its authority *before* the reception of the word under individual responsibility, while still, in the end, it leaves to every man his own burden. It is the church making war against God, and not the fruit of the blessing to which man is called.

	<div class="paragraph">
		I forbear to enter deeply into the meaning of this first parable, not because it is unimportant (far from it), but only because I think it must have been so often dwelt upon, both in public and in private, in the presence of the readers of these pages, that it is hardly necessary.<a name=7:1></a> The only thing that I will repeat here is, that what we have presented is not a doctrinal explanation of the origin of good, but the actual work, and its actual result under the responsibility of man -- the facts of the new dispensation, and not the counsels of God.<a name=7:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That which distinguishes the good ground, as far as the reception of the word is concerned, is a man's understanding the word.<a name=7:3></a> In the contrary case, strictly speaking, he does not understand it: in the two other cases, there is the appearance of it, but no fruit: here one regards nothing but fruit.<a name=7:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus far, we have only "the word of the kingdom.<a name=7:5></a>" In the six following parables we have similitudes of the kingdom itself, or the forms which the kingdom takes after the rejection of the king on the earth, and in consequence of the word being sown.<a name=7:6></a> It is easy to distinguish them into two parts; namely, the three first and the three last with the explanation of one of the first.<a name=7:7></a> The former are addressed to the multitudes; the latter, to the disciples apart.<a name=7:8></a> The former, it seems to me, present to us the exterior of the kingdom in the world, its state such as the world views it, without absolutely pronouncing the judgment of God thereupon.<a name=7:9></a> They are historical, as we have already seen.<a name=7:10></a> The latter give us the thoughts and intentions of God in the kingdom which exists here, and the result of this external whole.<a name=7:11></a> The efficacy of grace is never touched upon in this chapter; it is a history and not an explanation of doctrine.<a name=7:12></a><a href="#7:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>
	</div>
	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#7:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>In the three first, it is the actual result of the seed in the world. In the three last, it is the powerful motive which governed the heart of him who was led by this motive according to the secret of God.

		<a name=8>[Page 8]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It will be remarked that we find here, as in many other places, when the Spirit would present to us some general view of the thoughts of God, the perfect number of seven, divided, as is generally the case, into four and three -- four parables addressed to the multitudes, and three to the disciples.<a name=8:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have said that the three first parables present to us the exterior, the aspect of the kingdom towards the world; but that does not prevent a spiritual man discerning the principles which are there at work, nor his judging them according to the mind of God; on the contrary, it is what we ought constantly to do, in order to walk rightly according to the wisdom of God.<a name=8:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		However, I shall chiefly concern myself with the explanation of that which occurs in the parable itself.<a name=8:3></a> The first idea which is presented to us of the kingdom thus described in these mysteries, is a work done in a field by its owner; but all that he does now is to sow the good seed there.<a name=8:4></a> The work which he has wrought may fail in its general result, in the field, although the seed cannot be changed; and this is what comes to pass.<a name=8:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		While men sleep, the enemy of Him who sows the good seed and to whom the field belongs, comes to sow tares; and the field, or the beauty of the harvest, is spoilt.<a name=8:6></a> The owner of the field leaves those two things to bear their proper fruits.<a name=8:7></a> He to whom the field belonged had done His work; the enemy had done his, while men slept; then he also went his way: the effect was a sad mixture in the world, of which men might accuse the owner of the field; but the thing being manifested by its effects (for it had been done in secret) the servants discover it when it becomes public.<a name=8:8></a> The master explains to the servants who come to Him and receive their instruction from Him, that it is the work of the enemy, and that the harvest, as far as the world is concerned, will be spoiled.<a name=8:9></a> At the time of the harvest He will apply a remedy, that is to say, at the time of the judgment, which will make a distinction in the field between the good and the bad.<a name=8:10></a> It was not the servants' business to destroy the tares.<a name=8:11></a> They were not the executioners of the world's judgment, and the time itself was not yet come.<a name=8:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=9>[Page 9]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The kingdom only being established by sowing here below during the absence of the king, and not in power, and consequently by judgment, the confusion resulting therefrom would be the sad character of the kingdom, until it should be established in power, and the judgment should put an end to the disorder produced by Satan.<a name=9:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Compare here the manner in which the Lord presents His ways with the account of the seed in Mark 4: 26.<a name=9:2></a> The kingdom of God is as if a man, after having cast seed into the ground, should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow, he knows not how; for the earth produces of itself, first the blade, then the ear, and then the full corn in the ear; and when the corn is ripe, immediately they put in the sickle, because the harvest is ready.<a name=9:3></a> During the time of the mixture, and while the corn is not yet ripe, no judgment takes place; if it did, it might root out of the world the unripe corn.<a name=9:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		An attempt has been made to confound all this with church discipline; but the subject is different.<a name=9:5></a> The question is not about the church or discipline, but about the kingdom and about judgment to be exercised on the evil which Satan has introduced among the good corn.<a name=9:6></a><a href="#9:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>
	</div>
	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#9:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>My object is not controversy, but exposition of the parables i nevertheless, I must here add a word on the value of an interpretation often put upon this parable. That there is a mixture of Christians with the world is a matter of fact. <p>Many take advantage of this parable to justify themselves, or at least to say that we cannot root up the tares or exercise discipline. In the world-church this may be all very true; but, in the first place, if any one would reason thus to prove that the world-church system is good (for its existence is allowed as a matter of fact), such an one professes as a Christian to be willing to bring down the church on earth, in principle, to the level to which Satan has reduced it in fact; which is enough to convince me that one who has the glory of Christ at heart will not lend himself for a moment to such an idea. Again, when I find the whole is bad, I do not begin by rooting out the tares from this evil system; that is what they would do who stay there and would try to purify it. I do not quit the field; I cannot do it, for "the field is the world"; but the evil which I did I cease to do. I am still corn in the tare-field, I have not touched the tares; I have only as a Christian corrected my individual walk in some respects, and am thus separated by the fact itself from those who persist in the evil. If I can unite myself in peace with others to find the presence of Jesus according to His promise, so much the better; it is a great blessing. But I do not enter upon that question. My object is only to expound the parable, avoiding what is a mere sophism.

	<div class="paragraph">
		As for discipline, properly so called, that is always exercised on corn, and that not with a view to rooting it up, but curing it and even restoring it here below, if possible.<a name=10:1></a> The incestuous man was given up to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that his spirit might be saved in the day of the Lord.<a name=10:2></a> In fact, he was restored on earth, because he repented.<a name=10:3></a> It is not my intention to pursue this subject, but to expound the parables.<a name=10:4></a> I have only referred to it for the purpose of saying, that the two subjects have <i>not one idea in common</i>.<a name=10:5></a> We may here observe also how the Lord regards the kingdom and everything in it as a whole, from the beginning to the end of it.<a name=10:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In fine, that which we have revealed is, that the effect of Satan's work where Christ had sown the children of the kingdom, that is, this state of things on the earth, must remain till the harvest.<a name=10:7></a> The tares are not simply unconverted men; they are persons whom Satan has brought in, under the form of Christianity, to spoil God's harvest in the earth -- in the place where Christianity was established.<a name=10:8></a> It was not the church in heaven, it was not churches gathered in certain localities; these ideas are not found here.<a name=10:9></a> They are the children of the kingdom, regarded as plants of God in this world, but who are found in the place where Satan had power to sow his own seed.<a name=10:10></a> The effect, apparently not to the honour of the owner, is explained for those who learn from Him.<a name=10:11></a> The judgment will explain it to such as will not be taught.<a name=10:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards the judgment, the parable states that there is a time of harvest, and not the harvest merely.<a name=10:13></a> At that time the tares are first gathered and bound in bundles <i>for the purpose</i> of being burnt the corn is laid up in the granary.<a name=10:14></a><a href="#10:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>

		Generally speaking, the judgment or the harvest, such as it is presented in the parable itself, does not go beyond that which is manifested in this world.<a name=11:1></a> The tares are gathered for the purpose of being burnt: that is all; this is what is proper to the earth.<a name=11:2></a> The only thing which goes beyond what is external here below is the fact that the wheat is gathered into barns.<a name=11:3></a> It is a negative fact -- the wheat no longer belongs to the field: that which takes place in the barn does not appear.<a name=11:4></a> God interposes by means of the reapers to bind the tares in bundles (not heathen or unconverted men as such, but the wicked ones of Christendom, at least of the place where the good seed was sown) and He quite removes His own people from the scene.<a name=11:5></a> The natural state of the tares is destroyed, but it is not removed from the field.<a name=11:6></a> This then is the result in this world, the field which belongs to Christ, the sowing which He has performed.<a name=11:7></a>

		We now come to the explanations given to the disciples, and to the parables which were for their ears only.<a name=12:2></a> Here the seed is not properly the word; it is the children of the kingdom brought into the world by Christ, who have their life -- their moral existence -- from Him.<a name=12:3></a> We sow the word; but here the great fact is, that the Son of man brings His own into the world; it is a work which He begins.<a name=12:4></a> The vineyard being rejected, He does not look for that in the world which was not found in Israel.<a name=12:5></a> He introduces, but in the world, His own, because it was all over for the time, at least with Israel.<a name=12:6></a> When He has done that, Satan does the same; active in evil, on the ground where good has been done.<a name=12:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Israel, the people of God, is become wicked, and, led by the prince of this world, they reject their Saviour, their Messiah.<a name=12:8></a> God being thereupon active in good in the world, Satan assumes an attitude of active hostility.<a name=12:9></a> To spoil the effect here below, is all he can do.<a name=12:10></a> But the judgment takes effect upon it: the harvest is the end of the age, the reapers are the angels; for the question here is about the government of this world by God.<a name=12:11></a> As to the expression "<i>this age</i>," we are accustomed to apply it to the church; but it is not here a question of the church, but of the introduction of the kingdom of heaven, Messiah being rejected by the Jews.<a name=12:12></a> What was the age in which the Lord was found with His disciples?<a name=12:13></a> Was it the church, or the dispensation of the church?<a name=12:14></a> By no means.<a name=12:15></a> It was a certain age of this world, which was to end by the reception of the Messiah, and the re-establishment of the law as a rule by the government of this Messiah.<a name=12:16></a> The people of Israel having rejected Him, this age becomes purely and simply <i>this present evil world (age)</i>, from which Christ delivers us, but in the course of which God has set up His kingdom, in the way we have just spoken of.<a name=12:17></a>

		The final close of the age is suspended while these acts are in progress, but at last its end arrives.<a name=12:18></a> Then the Son of man (for here the world is concerned, not merely the Jews and their Messiah) will purge His kingdom of all things that offend, and of them that commit iniquity, and they shall be cast into the furnace of fire.<a name=12:19></a> That will be the judgment of everything that is opposed to the glory of Christ, when He will execute it.<a name=12:20></a> But here He appears as the Head of the providential government of God, not as the Bridegroom coming to seek His bride, nor as the King coming to reign in Israel, or over the Gentiles in immediate relationship with them.<a name=12:21></a> It is the Son of man, supreme Head of the government of God, who sends the angels of His power to purge His kingdom, long defiled by the presence of the children of the wicked one, of everything that offends.<a name=12:22></a><a href="#12:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> It is an act of His own power, acting as from on high; it is not the servants who will execute it.<a name=12:23></a> He sends His own messengers to gather the tares and cast them into the fire.<a name=12:24></a> He does not Himself enter into the earthly kingdom already established.<a name=12:25></a> He acts as from on high by His messengers, and the righteous are not established and blessed in the marred kingdom, but they shine as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.<a name=12:26></a><a href="#12:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a>

We see our own glory in the sun to which we shall be like. In the two cases there is the glory. "The glory which thou hast given me, I have given them," so that He, while yet looking forward to it for Himself, gives up all His Jewish and even personal glory, in a certain sense, as of right, to bring the church in there; in a word, He gives it up for the church. We, seeing that glory as ours, see it in Christ; and so in the application of the parable, we may say, Jesus has done it for the church as His treasure -- we do it for Christ as our treasure. The counsel of God is, that we should be together in that glory.

		The succeeding parables present to us rather the secrets of the kingdom -- that which only concerns the initiated, the disciples.<a name=14:6></a> It was no longer that which was merely external for the multitudes which surrounded Him.<a name=14:7></a> In what was said to the multitudes, everything took place in the world, that is to say, in the field, with the exception of the one fact that the good seed would be taken from it and hid in the barn.<a name=14:8></a> All belonged, properly speaking, to this age, unless we may except the existence of the barn.<a name=14:9></a> But in the explanation of this first parable, the Lord goes beyond what He had said, passes the limit, so to speak, and shews us the terrible result of the judgment of the tares in the weeping and gnashing of teeth: then He raises the curtain on the other side also, and the righteous shine as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.<a name=14:10></a> But this throws an entirely new light on the principle of the kingdom.<a name=14:11></a> It is a motive to action wherever this revelation is understood, and wherever we act according to the understanding of this purpose of God.<a name=14:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is no longer a question how to establish clearly the relations between the old system and the forms which it took after the rejection of Christ, or on account of the barren state of the vineyard; but how to comprehend the effect of the counsels of God, which went much farther.<a name=14:13></a> There was something there to influence the heart.<a name=14:14></a> We have before had the effects here below of the sowing: the fact of the mixture, and the separation, and the form which in consequence of that the kingdom took in the world; here we have the revelation to the disciples of the effect outside the world, and consequently the motive which directed him who had understanding in the kingdom (it was this that characterised the kingdom in this respect); lastly, the discernment which knew how to act, even in the circumstances of this confused state of the kingdom, and not only the fact of this confusion in the world.<a name=14:15></a> That explains the order of the parables.<a name=14:16></a> In the two cases, the historical part for the multitude gives the sowing and the divine judgment at the end (this is all that the mind of the multitude takes notice of); and after that, the great historical facts, the tree and the leaven.<a name=14:17></a>

		Now, the first principle, the general principle of the two first of these three parables, based, as I have said, on the revelation of the glory of the righteous, made in the explanation of the first of the three former, is the energy which renounces everything on account of the discovery of that which becomes of inestimable value to the soul.<a name=15:6></a> This would not have been the character of the kingdom, if it had been established among the Jews; there were principles and a conduct which would have suited it.<a name=15:7></a> Its authority would have been exercised for the maintenance of good and justice, and great happiness would have been the fruit of its establishment.<a name=15:8></a> But the kingdom, once rejected by those who were the children of it, was no longer of this world, and it became necessary for one to give up everything that he possessed, according to the discovery made of the glory, which thereupon belonged to the faithful in the kingdom of their Father.<a name=15:9></a> This glory causes a renunciation of everything in order to possess it, according to the counsels of God, of which He has made a discovery in the revelation of this treasure -- the church, properly so called.<a name=15:10></a> Christ Himself did so, and even in two different ways.<a name=15:11></a>

		He gave up everything, He emptied Himself to accomplish this work and buy the church.<a name=16:1></a> But again, of how great value to Himself and for God must the church, thus brought to glory before Him, have been, that He should quit the glory of His Father, His bosom, to have and to bring back His church with Him!<a name=16:2></a> In effect, it was because it was infinitely precious to the Father, and because He wished to have it before Him holy and without blame, that the Son, according to His love for the Father, gave Himself for it, the Father having entrusted to Him this work, and the church itself, that He might bring it to Him; for if the Father loves the Son, and has delivered all things to Him, so also the Son has given His life, that the world may know that He loves the Father, and that as the Father has given Him commandment, so He does.<a name=16:3></a> For He came to do His Father's will.<a name=16:4></a>

		Still, as royal Heir of the kingdom, lawful and perfect Head, according to God, of the Jews, the people of God, and heirs of the promises according to the flesh, it was necessary for Him to give up all that, even this peculiar height of exaltation.<a name=16:5></a> He could weep over Jerusalem, whose children He would so often have gathered.<a name=16:6></a> He could understand the value of whatever was glorious in that situation.<a name=16:7></a> He could feel all the force of those words: "thou hast lifted me up and cast me down," Psalm 102.<a name=16:8></a> Nevertheless, for the joy of possessing the church, this fair and precious creation of the Father in grace and light, this jewel of the light of God, this expression of the thoughts of the Father in grace, witness during the ages to come of the grace which it has received (and that because it is the reflection of it) -- for the joy, I say, which followed upon the discovery of this treasure which was not of the world, but of God, in the light, He gave up all He possessed among the Jews; He looked upon all else as nothing.<a name=16:9></a>

		Answering perfectly to the thought of God His Father, in regard of that which was the glorious object of the love of God, a creation not external to Himself as Creator, but formed to be before Him, according to His nature which He had communicated to it as far as was possible, Christ -- who had emptied Himself indeed, but who answered not the less on that account but so much the more to the whole thought of the Father, gave up everything to fulfil the will of the Father and to possess Himself of this treasure.<a name=17:1></a> So the kingdom takes this character.<a name=17:2></a> It is in <i>Christ</i> that <i>we</i> see it, even this reflection of the nature of the Father, for He is not only by grace (a creative and communicative grace) but essentially the reflection and the image of the glory of the invisible God.<a name=17:3></a> He is morally the manifestation of it in all things, and beyond that, inasmuch as all the Godhead dwells in Him bodily.<a name=17:4></a> Thus we also, for the sake of Christ glorified before the Father, for this glory which we shall have with Him, when we shall be like Him, seeing Him as He is, but which henceforth we see in Him -- we also renounce everything now.<a name=17:5></a> (Compare Philippians 3: 7, 8.<a name=17:6></a>) Still it is Christ who has given us the example of it, by devotedness to His Father; Paul was only a weak imitator of Him who inspired him, and had supplied him with the perfect model of that devotedness.<a name=17:7></a>

		But then Christ, however He might renounce His earthly glory and rights could not yet possess the church all pure and glorious as being His peculiar property, separate to Himself.<a name=17:8></a> He must take it in the world; but that does not hinder Him, He places it there and buys the whole field.<a name=17:9></a> But the treasure is His object, and is sufficient to engage Him to take the whole field; for the subject here is not the beneficent government which shall be established over the world, when the judgments which will have purified it will have been executed, but of something which He takes for the sake of the treasure which is hid there.<a name=17:10></a> Elsewhere, in the prophets we see all the blessings which will flow from His reign (the church, the new Jerusalem, being glorified, so that the nations will walk in its light), blessings which will be the effect of the public administration of the kingdom of the Son of man.<a name=17:11></a> But here we have the mysteries of this kingdom presented to a spiritual understanding.<a name=17:12></a>

		Let us come to the application, or rather to the explanation, followed by the parable of the treasure hid in the field.<a name=18:1></a> We have here the secret thought of God.<a name=18:2></a> The subject is not properly that external character of the kingdom, but the inward thought of Him who is acting there.<a name=18:3></a> Christ Himself has taken to Himself a field, but for one who understands His thought -- is the field His object in taking it now?<a name=18:4></a> No; it is the treasure in it.<a name=18:5></a> <i>There is</i> that which fills His heart, and which was the motive to that which He did.<a name=18:6></a> God gave Him power over all men, that He might give eternal life to all those whom the Father had given to Him.<a name=18:7></a> I would not be understood by that to say that all men are the field, but only to shew how there could be two thoughts in the counsels of God.<a name=18:8></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#19:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>Although the great principle of giving up all for Christ is a true one (and we have already spoken of it), we cannot apply the details of this parable to the history of an individual soul. A soul is never called on to buy anything to have the treasure; but to seek to have nothing except it. In fact, in the history of souls, something similar often occurs; that is to say, one embraces Christianity, true Christianity, with a joy which seizes all in an indiscriminate manner, so to speak. The soul possesses in effect the true treasure, but has not yet at all discerned the whole beauty of this exquisite pearl. The joy then becomes in appearance more subdued, but the spiritual perception of the thoughts of God is far more real and deep.

	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#19:f2"><sup>++</sup></a>All this does not by any means affect the question of the conduct or the duty of a saint in these circumstances. The parable only presents the thoughts of God in regard to facts. This was the form which the kingdom would take, or rather a figure which represents it. The purchased field is quite an abstract thought; we are always in danger of confounding it with the actual state of things, while the parable only presents to us the principle. I have endeavoured to avoid this snare, but am not sure that I have succeeded. In principle, Christ has bought the world, and the church is *in it*. His authority only extends to a very small part of the world; and one part, formerly subject to His authority, has now even revolted from it; but the parable does not at all touch upon these facts. It only presents the principle, that is to say, that there is a treasure hidden, which was not even bought but found, and something external was bought for the love of this treasure, thus hidden there, necessarily, and as a matter of fact; whether the treasure exists as an individual whole, or in several pieces, is not the question here. The purchaser takes the whole, such as it is, for the sake of the treasure. The delight which He finds in the beauty of it (the church) is the subject of this parable. Here it is the fact of the field purchased as a whole, that He might possess the treasure that was dear to Him. Neither is it a question of the establishment of the authority of Christ in blessing in this world, nor of His joy in the deliverance of the creation itself. That will take place in the world to come, when there will no longer be a question about the mysteries of the kingdom. This mystery of God will be finished; the natural results of the reign of the Saviour will be manifested, also the beauty of the church will be manifested on high; and its glory will shine everywhere.

		Although the church is of God in its existence and its beauty, we must also take account of that which Christ has done, according to the counsels of God, according to the fulness of His desire, and the delight which He takes in these counsels.<a name=22:1></a> He gives Himself up to that, and strips Himself of everything, in order to possess the church, such as it is according to the thought of God; and, to the disciple who has understanding, this is the character which the kingdom takes.<a name=22:2></a> It is Christ's treasure in this world, in the field which He buys; it is the pearl quite pure, out of whatever shell it may have come, which answers to all that His heart seeks.<a name=22:3></a>

		Hitherto we have the spiritual intelligence, in order to the understanding of the principle which characterises the kingdom in the thought of Christ, upon which, in consequence, the believer acts, according to the measure of his intelligence.<a name=22:4></a> But there is, besides, an actual separation of the elements which are mingled within it.<a name=22:5></a> In effect, the net has gathered all kinds of persons out of the sea of peoples.<a name=22:6></a> When the net is full, those who have drawn it, the fishermen, sit on the shore; they gather the good into vessels, and throw aside the bad.<a name=22:7></a> Here let us pause a moment, because important principles present themselves to our thoughts.<a name=22:8></a> The fishermen are occupied about the good: they put them into vessels.<a name=22:9></a> As for the bad, they only reject them, and put them aside: there is the effect of the understanding of the fisherman.<a name=22:10></a> What is his object?<a name=22:11></a> with what does he concern himself?<a name=22:12></a> With the good fish.<a name=22:13></a> To have them according to his desire and purpose, he must in passing, reject the others, but it is only that he may have the good.<a name=22:14></a> Except in this respect, he has nothing to do with the bad -- they are not his concern; they are only an encumbrance to him: the net was not cast for them.<a name=22:15></a> He gathers the good into vessels.<a name=22:16></a> Neither is their ultimate destination his concern: his business is to catch them, and gather them into vessels apart.<a name=22:17></a> In this his capacity, his diligence, and the success of his toils, appear.<a name=22:18></a> Without these, he could not do it.<a name=22:19></a> All this is addressed exclusively to a spiritual mind, without which we cannot understand these instructions.<a name=22:20></a> But there is one work, the effects of which will be of necessity intelligible; and as in the exposition of the parable of the tares, we have the additional fact of the glory of the righteous in another sphere -- a fact which represented in a good light the seeming negligence that had taken place in the government of the kingdom; so in the explanation of the net, we have a fact which is not in the parable, namely, the judgment of the wicked.<a name=22:21></a>

		The angels will come forth at the end of the age, and will separate the wicked from among the righteous (they do not here concern themselves with the righteous, as the fishermen did), and they will cast them into the furnace of fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.<a name=23:1></a> It is quite clear that this is a procedure quite different from what is related in the parable, and which goes beyond the contents of it.<a name=23:2></a> The subject is not the net merely, it is a general and definite separation of the wicked from among the righteous at that time.<a name=23:3></a> The fishermen were only concerned with the contents of their net, and with the good found in it.<a name=23:4></a> The angels, at the end of the age, separate the <i>wicked</i>; it is a general work; and in this world, where they are mingled, it is not the angels that have to do with the net.<a name=23:5></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Some think there is an historical order in the parables, an order which I proceed to state without making any comment upon it, as a thought upon which every brother will form an opinion according to the light which he possesses.<a name=24:1></a> First, the general fact of the sowing of the word, begun by Jesus Himself; then, as we have seen, the beginning of the mysteries of the kingdom: the Son of man sows the good seed, the enemy does his own work there.<a name=24:2></a> The first effect: the hierarchical or ecclesiastico-secular power in the world.<a name=24:3></a> The second effect: nominal Christianity, a leaven which only corrupts the whole lump.<a name=24:4></a> Then comes the discovery that it is the treasure hid in this field which is precious; those who have spiritual understanding distinguish this treasure, although it is hidden in the field.<a name=24:5></a> This would be the Augustinian and Protestant doctrine of an invisible church.<a name=24:6></a> But, beyond that, there is the perception of the beauty and purity which become this treasure, and they are sought by those who are led by the Spirit of Christ.<a name=24:7></a> Lastly, there is the practical separation of the good fish put into vessels by those who are concerned with that work.<a name=24:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This then is the idea; each Christian, I repeat, will judge of it, according to his measure of spiritual understanding.<a name=25:1></a> However it may be, there is yet something to be said on the subject of the great tree and the leaven, in reference to what may be discovered in them by a spiritual mind.<a name=25:2></a> The difference between that which is described in these parables, and what is said in the three last, is very remarkable.<a name=25:3></a> Here there is no trace of spiritual affection, nor of a taste for divine things, nor of distinction between good and evil.<a name=25:4></a> The love of the Spirit is completely missing, and is even lost.<a name=25:5></a> I say lost, because at the beginning the servants distinguished between the good seed and the tares, and that perfectly well, and were astonished to find tares in a field where their master had been sowing, although it did not belong to them to execute the judgment on the tares.<a name=25:6></a> They were employed near the master, attending to the good condition of the field which belonged to him, but the field could only be cleansed by judgment.<a name=25:7></a> Didst Thou not sow good seed in <i>Thy</i> field?<a name=25:8></a> (that was their question): from whence then hath it tares?<a name=25:9></a> Afterwards, a spiritual understanding perceives that the field is only a secondary object, fully admitting that it was bought; it seeks for the pure and precious pearl, and also separates the good fish and puts them into vessels.<a name=25:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But here it is not that; it is a picture of a dark worldly and outward effect.<a name=25:11></a> The attachment to the interests of Christ fails; it is an external matter, a common condition, where nothing appears but what the world can see.<a name=25:12></a> We do not say that there are not children of God hidden in this system, or such as have been separated from it; but the Spirit of God takes no account of them in these parables, nor of any spirituality which perceives them, or which distinguishes between that which is agreeable to Christ in His kingdom and the contrary: the result of the work exactly corresponds with the world.<a name=25:13></a> We could not (according to these parables) distinguish them: it is "a great tree," a symbol, throughout scripture, of human power and pride, the objects of God's judgment.<a name=25:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is only when Christ will establish His own kingdom in power, that this kingdom will become a great tree in the earth, according to the counsels of God in righteousness.<a name=25:15></a> (See Ezekiel 17: 22-24.<a name=25:16></a>) Meanwhile the event takes place, but as we have seen, with a total absence of spiritual discernment, which contrasts with what precedes and what follows.<a name=25:17></a> Also observe, with respect to the leaven: this is not external and earthly power; it is the universal diffusion of a doctrine within certain limits.<a name=25:18></a> Here we must remark that it is not the Son of man who sows the good seed, that idea is lost: it is the state of the kingdom which will bear a resemblance to the effect of a woman's deed who acts thus.<a name=25:19></a> Thus there is not any distinction made here between the sowing of the Son of man, and the work of the enemy.<a name=25:20></a> If there is good seed, it is quite lost sight of.<a name=25:21></a> The parable of the good seed and the tares proves to us that this distinction had been made by the servants of Christ, but all appearance of it is lost; we cannot say that all is good, for the tares must grow till the harvest.<a name=25:22></a> All spiritual discernment is therefore completely excluded from this state of things; all true testimony to the work of God is lost; for one cannot say that all is good, that would be the testimony according to the heart of God.<a name=25:23></a> All distinction between the good and evil is destroyed; it is one lump, so that this testimony to the difference of good and evil is also lost; and thus evil under the name of Christ is that which presents itself as a uniform mass.<a name=25:24></a>

		I would not here say that the Holy Spirit designed to present this idea to the multitude.<a name=26:1></a> I have already said that these parables speak of what is outward, of the external aspect of the kingdom; but he who studies the word judges according to the mind of Christ of that which is presented thus to the world.<a name=26:2></a> <i>There</i> is that which distinguishes the true Christian -- the spiritual man discerns all things.<a name=26:3></a> He does not think that the lump will be changed, for the spiritual man distinguishes and loves what is good; but the state of the mass does not govern him: he knows for himself that everywhere else the great tree is the symbol of exalted man.<a name=26:4></a> Ought man to be exalted before the manifestation of Christ?<a name=26:5></a> He knows that leaven everywhere else is the symbol of that which is bad.<a name=26:6></a> Has not the history of Christendom supplied that which fully corresponds to such a symbol?<a name=26:7></a> If it is so, it is that which according to the Lord characterises the state of the kingdom.<a name=26:8></a> In that case, what ought the Christian to do?<a name=26:9></a> Ought he to be contented with bearing such a testimony as being Christ's?<a name=26:10></a>

		NOTE.<a name=27:1></a> -- It is most important for us to remember, that all that, which is the power of death in the unbeliever, is the hindrance and blight of the fruit-bearing power of the believer's life, to which the energies afforded us in the divine Persons apply themselves.<a name=27:2></a> This is brought out into full light, with its specific remedy, in the graciousness of God in this parable.<a name=27:3></a> There is the case of the fowls of the air, the stony ground, the sowing among thorns, and in the good ground, thirty, sixty, and a hundredfold.<a name=27:4></a> The first of these we know is the power of Satan -- the power of death.<a name=27:5></a> There is no life in the soul.<a name=27:6></a> When the word of it is sown in the unbroken heart, the devil takes it away as soon as it is sown; he holds it in unremoved death.<a name=27:7></a> The word is the power of life.<a name=27:8></a> "Of his own will begat he us by the word of truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.<a name=27:9></a>" It is indeed <i>the lie</i> of the devil, by which he brought in death and holds men in it, in which he is a murderer; so on the other hand, by the truth of God are we made alive.<a name=27:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is One (Himself indeed <i>the</i> WORD), who is specifically the quickening power, even the Son of God.<a name=27:11></a> "The last Adam is the quickening Spirit.<a name=27:12></a>" He then who vindicates from this state of death, and makes alive, is the Son of God.<a name=27:13></a> The Son of man sows the seed, but it is the Son of God who quickens; "for this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.<a name=27:14></a>" It is the special distinctive character of His sonship, that He quickens with divine power, as indeed none else could.<a name=27:15></a> Compare John 5: 21, 24, 26.<a name=27:16></a> This is most explicit, and no one acquainted with scripture can have failed to recognise this power of life in the Son of God, as distinctly representing His power and character.<a name=27:17></a> He declares Himself, "I am the resurrection and the life"; and this by His word, "Lazarus, come forth.<a name=27:18></a>" The results of this we shall not follow; but we have the Son of God, by the word, destroying the works of the devil in the state and power of death.<a name=27:19></a> This is the first case of the parable.<a name=27:20></a> That which is in Him is the opposite power, which overcomes the evil case mentioned; and a man brings forth thirtyfold, for being really alive he must increase and bring forth fruit.<a name=27:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is another case put, not so apparently desperate, but equally destructive -- the receiving the word into shallow ground.<a name=27:22></a> There was no root.<a name=27:23></a> It was received superficially; it speedily "sprang up, <i>because</i> it had no deepness of earth"; it had no searching process of power in which it entered into the conscience and quickened the inner man.<a name=27:24></a> It rested in the natural affections and understanding which are after all <i>the flesh</i>; it is received merely by the natural feelings, and therefore immediately acts, and with joy, since it reaches not the conscience; and the same natural feelings were of course as speedily acted on by trouble and persecution, and "immediately they are offended.<a name=27:25></a>" Compare Mark 4.<a name=27:26></a> This, then, is all merely the flesh, and comes to nothing.<a name=27:27></a> To this we know how uniformly the Spirit is opposed.<a name=27:28></a> "The flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary the one to the other.<a name=27:29></a>" "They that are after the flesh mind the things of the flesh; and they that are after the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.<a name=27:30></a>" "If ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds," etc.<a name=27:31></a> It needs not to multiply passages of scripture to shew the opposition of these two.<a name=27:32></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=28>[Page 28]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, we must observe that we have <i>here</i> in the Spirit the antagonist power which overcomes the flesh, and assuming a man to be alive, still does so.<a name=28:1></a> "The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit"; hence we know that this case is still the natural man, and that the things of the Spirit are what he has never received, though affections or intellect may have been moved or delighted with the marvellous plan of redemption.<a name=28:2></a> But the same point holds good in a believer; that is, we find when men do not walk in the Spirit, of course they are profitless and low in their estate.<a name=28:3></a> It is in mortifying the flesh by the Spirit, that the fruits of the Spirit find comparatively free growth -- it produces sixtyfold.<a name=28:4></a> This, then, is the contrast here -- the flesh and the Spirit; and we find in it, that the fairest form of the flesh, the apparently joyful reception of the word of the kingdom, whether it be in affection or intellect, comes to nothing; whatever it be occupied on, it is but "the desires of the flesh and of the mind.<a name=28:5></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The third case, compared with other scriptures, is equally clear I think.<a name=28:6></a> The hindering power is declared directly, "the cares of this world, the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things.<a name=28:7></a>" Compare Mark 4; Luke 8.<a name=28:8></a> Now, the world and the love of it we continually find opposed to the Father.<a name=28:9></a> "All that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but of the world.<a name=28:10></a>" "Love not the world, neither the things of the world; if any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.<a name=28:11></a>" The hatred of the world to the Son, shewed that <i>it</i> was not of the Father; and the children were not of this world any more than the Father, as allied to Him, even as Christ the Son was not of the world.<a name=28:12></a>

		Every one familiarly and spiritually acquainted with the Gospel of John must have noticed the opposition between the world and the sonship of Christ; one being associated with the Father, and the other directly opposed to the glory of the Father, in the great question of that sonship in which alone it was known.<a name=29:1></a> Our Lord thus concludes the whole presenting of His work and His people to the Father: "O righteous Father, the <i>world</i> hath not known thee, but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.<a name=29:2></a>" The whole chapter illustrates the question.<a name=29:3></a> Now we shall hence well understand the opposition between the two, and how He "who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this present evil world," closes that statement by saying: "and I have declared unto them thy name and I will declare it, that the love," etc.<a name=29:4></a> But, in the believer, even when not only quickened, but in the Spirit exercising himself to mortify the deeds of the body, who recognises at once the evil of the flesh (though we are little aware how subtly and widely its beguiling and deceiving influence is spread, how fair a form inbred selfishness may assume), and in whom, in an ordinary sense, the flesh is habitually in a measure mortified; how often do we find the world holding a prevailing power and recognised title over the judgment or habit, and the fruitfulness, comparatively speaking, utterly marred!<a name=29:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit, so shall ye be my disciples.<a name=29:6></a>" Let us then recognise, on the sole basis of scripture (excluding the consideration of the circumstances in which <i>the lie</i> of this world has power over our mind), that the world is a positive hinderer of fruitfulness, the much fruit in which the Father is glorified; and for this plain reason, that our sonship, our inheritance, the kingdom is not recognised.<a name=29:7></a> The devil, as he acts on us by the flesh, "the lust of the flesh," "good for food," or "of the eyes," and the like, is the god and prince of this world; and the Spirit in them that are quickened, where not dimmed and darkened by the spirit of this world, is not only the power of the difference of the carnal and spiritual nature, but bears witness that we are sons and heirs.<a name=29:8></a> Thus at liberty, we cry by it, Abba, Father; and the fruits are an hundredfold, where we are free from the system in which we are fettered.<a name=29:9></a> The energy of the kingdom is there, the Saviour of the kingdom is there, the stamp of the Father of glory, and hence, in deadness to the world, power over it.<a name=29:10></a> The whole stamp of nature is different; we are not of the world as Christ is not of the world.<a name=29:11></a> Accordingly, as we find the Lord the true vine, so we find the Father the husbandman, purging the branches, that they may bring forth more fruit.<a name=29:12></a> We may be isolated indeed, but isolated <i>sons</i>, upon whom the glory of the Father shines in hope and the power of inward association; the sons of God, though in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation.<a name=29:13></a> In a word, the children of God (the God who hath called us to "His own kingdom and glory," the living God) is our distinguishing title; and, as the Jews were affianced to Jehovah, we are called to be "perfect as our Father which is in heaven is perfect.<a name=29:14></a>"

		I cannot pursue this subject farther here, though I may touch on it, with the Lord's permission, at a future time.<a name=30:1></a> As regards the explanation of the parable, I would say a very few words more.<a name=30:2></a> The inseparableness of the evils, as well as of the gracious agents of covenant remedy, is not in question; the devil, the world, and the flesh, are too intimately associated to need explanation of our distinct consideration of them; and I believe more intimately than people are commonly aware of.<a name=30:3></a> Of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, I need not speak; but while we have spoken of them in operation as to profit, we must not forget their unity in every act, whether of creation, or anything else: they invariably act in one, and as invariably, as far as I see, in the same order, that is, by the Son, through the energy of the Spirit.<a name=30:4></a>

		Another remark is necessary.<a name=30:5></a> Although we have looked at the love of the world, as hindering the full characteristic fruitfulness of the children of God, and the knowledge and love of the Father as the contrasted character, we must remember that this knowledge in principle is the portion of every believer.<a name=30:6></a> "I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father"; nor could we otherwise put all believers under this responsibility.<a name=30:7></a> But I believe it will be found that the measure of the fruitfulness of the life that is in them much depends on their exercise in the truths here noticed and dwelt on; and that the character of their fruitfulness also much depends on their fuller and deeper apprehension of the one or the other; and that the apprehension of the Father in the full development of the sonship glory attaches quite a new character on the whole course of the Christian's life.<a name=30:8></a> This is our proper calling; and, while we must watch against the neglect of distinct reference to the Son (as administering the power of the kingdom against the "wicked one"), to the Spirit (as overcoming or detecting the workings and deceitful power of the flesh), to the Father (in contrast with the love of the world), a defective apprehension of the principle of heavenly glory will somewhere or other break down the efficiency of our christian service.<a name=30:9></a> The fulness of all was in our Lord; the fulness of all help in them is our practical responsibility; the enjoyment of fellowship with them our privilege.<a name=30:10></a> Ill-proportioned Christianity, I believe, continually springs from the power of Satan, through neglect of, or hindering the special power of one or another of the Persons, while indulgence of any of the evils is apt to throw us into the hands of Satan; and here is the wisdom of ministering to sick souls, for the source of the evil may be one, its manifestation may be another.<a name=30:11></a> How blessed to be able to refer to covenant assurance of a threefold Almighty help for the several difficulties one evil may bring!<a name=30:12></a> A believer will be healthful and strong against the enemy in proportion as he has just reference to all.<a name=30:13></a>

		I do not say that a believer's progress is, from knowing the Son, to the Spirit and the Father -- far from it; but I believe the manifestation of the power and glory of their work will gradually unfold itself, even as the quickening by the Son will make the believer discern well the operations of the Spirit against the flesh, and both of these find their full development in the manifestation of the Father's glory, in the consciousness (if he grow healthfully) that His kingdom is not of this world.<a name=31:1></a> In some cases of unusual energy of divine life, we see by God's calling, all these apprehensions promptly developed, and the man consequently abundantly exercised, and his service great, corresponding to the knowledge received of the Son in the kingdom, as in the apostles Peter and Paul; but I must not outstep the practical part of the subject.<a name=31:2></a>

		The immediate answer to this revelation which the Saviour makes of His glory as Son of man, is, in the three first Gospels, the transfiguration, compared by Peter himself to the power and coming of our Lord Jesus (2 Peter 1: 16-18); the future glory of the Son of man, such as it will be manifested to the faithful remnant of the people, is revealed to the astonished eyes of the poor disciples.<a name=36:1></a> The risen and the changed are in the same glory as the Saviour, they are with Him, and hold converse with Him; the law and the prophets give way to the glorified Son of God, who alone is to be heard.<a name=36:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		From this moment Jesus speaks only of suffering this faithless and perverse generation, but He is unwearied in doing them good.<a name=36:3></a> He shews to His disciples the part that men (not the Jews only) would have in His death.<a name=36:4></a> The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of <i>men</i>!<a name=36:5></a> The point for the disciples is the power of faith; nevertheless it was needful to live near to God in withdrawment from all that belonged to the flesh, in order to conquer and cast out the power of the enemy.<a name=36:6></a>

		At the end of the chapter, the Lord takes advantage of His rights as Son, to identify His disciples with Him in this same privilege; but still, not to offend, He submits to His position as a subject Jew, which Peter was forward to attribute to Him.<a name=36:7></a> In this beautiful passage He shews His divinity in the two-fold respect of knowledge of the thoughts, and of power over creation; but at the same time He identifies Himself with Peter (who had made of Him a Jew like any other), saying "lest <i>we</i>"; and if a fish is made to bring the money needed for Him, it is for His poor disciple as well as for Him -- "for Me and thee.<a name=36:8></a>" He places them with Him in the position of sons, and places Himself with them in theirs, though He was the God of all knowledge, whom every creature, save man, was eager to obey.<a name=36:9></a> He puts Himself on the same footing with them, where love and humility were happy in grace towards the poor, the poorest of all Himself!<a name=36:10></a>

		It is upon this basis of the humiliation of the Saviour, a principle which is linked with grace and is its perfect manifestation, that all which follows here is founded.<a name=37:1></a> Jesus would have His disciples to take this place, and identifying themselves with what is least, as He had done Himself, to act also in grace; for He was come (a position infinitely more glorious than that of the Messiah, whence the Jews repulsed Him, because He spoke the truth) to seek and to save that which was lost.<a name=37:2></a> And such was the case with all men, children as well as others; for the Lord applies here to a little child the principles of Luke 15; but if they were lost, it was not the Father's will that they should perish.<a name=37:3></a> Even so in the church (for it is founded upon the rejection of the Messiah) His own ought to act in grace towards a brother, come what will.<a name=37:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here is the rule, his brother must be <i>gained</i>; self-humiliation raises us to this elevation, and permits us to act in grace toward all.<a name=37:5></a> But this grace, pursued even to the end by the care of the congregation, and rejected by him who was the object of it, would place him (whether Jew or Gentile) in the position of a publican and a pagan.<a name=37:6></a> On the one hand, grace becomes the principle of action; on the other, the church, established and acting on the principle of grace, becomes the enclosure with reference to which one should speak of the without and the within of a publican and a pagan; for all that the disciples should bind on earth would be bound in heaven.<a name=37:7></a> Such is the marvellous effect of the rejection of the Messiah and the position of those identified with Him in this rejection; for now, where two or three are gathered in His name, Jesus is found in their midst.<a name=37:8></a> There has He put His name for a blessing.<a name=37:9></a> See Exodus 20: 24; Deuteronomy 12: 5, 11, etc.<a name=37:10></a> Thus the effects of His rejection on the power of this accomplished work before the Father are unrolled (though this was as in a shadow) before His eyes.<a name=37:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In answer to Peter, who asks how far this walking in grace ought to be carried, the Lord shews that, as it was a principle essential to the nature which acted in grace, there was no limit; it would be a limit to the privilege of man and to the nature of God.<a name=37:12></a> In the kingdom of heaven, mercy triumphs over judgment.<a name=37:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		38 The Lord gives, notwithstanding, not only a principle, but a similitude of the kingdom, which applies, it seems to me, historically.<a name=37:14></a> The Jews being guilty of ten thousand talents by the crucifixion of the Son of God, God acts in grace by the preaching of the gospel to the nation, in virtue of the intercession of Jesus, to which answers the preaching of Peter on the testimony of the Holy Ghost (Acts 3); but they refuse the grace to the Gentiles, much less guilty toward them than they themselves were toward God, and the wrath came upon them to the uttermost.<a name=37:15></a> Luke 23: 34; Acts 3: 17; 1 Thessalonians 2: 16.<a name=37:16></a>

		The chapter is remarkable in this respect, that is to say, for the manner in which Jesus confirms for the Jews that which was fundamental in the law, "These things do, and thou shalt live.<a name=39:4></a>" He maintains the everlasting righteousness of God as regards the ties of nature: He founds all this upon that which preceded even the law, and (since the relations on which the law was based preceded the law) He appeals from it to what was of God at the beginning.<a name=39:5></a> He also goes beyond the law for him who observed it in his ordinary relationship, and presents Himself as the true touchstone for the heart -- Him, the rejected One, who was not of the world.<a name=39:6></a> What is the only means of arriving at it?<a name=39:7></a> The answer is: "With God all things are possible.<a name=39:8></a>" He recognises all that God had put in Judaism; but he ceases to be a Jew: the young man could not live on such a footing.<a name=39:9></a>

		These words of Jesus excite in the spirit of Peter this question: What shall we have therefore -- we who <i>have</i> forsaken all and followed thee?<a name=39:10></a> The answer, founded on the glory already revealed on the mount of transfiguration, is, that when the Son of man shall return in His glory, in the regeneration, the twelve shall be in their place on twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.<a name=39:11></a>

		This answer leaves all aside, until the restoration of Israel, and places again the disciples in connection with this principle, omitting what, in the interval, was for the church; but it is also wholly outside the legal relationships of the people with God.<a name=39:12></a> If the law were accomplished, life would be the result.<a name=39:13></a> Those who followed Christ, when the Jews under the law rejected Him, should judge Israel in the day of the glory of the Son of man.<a name=39:14></a> They had followed the Lord in His rejection by Israel; they should participate in His glory when He should be the glorious Head of His people and of the entire world.<a name=39:15></a> Moreover, whoever had acted faithfully in this relation and taken Christ for his portion should receive an hundredfold here below, and besides life everlasting.<a name=39:16></a> Nevertheless one can judge nothing beforehand as to the relative degree of glory of individuals by their present position.<a name=39:17></a>

The province of His rule, and all the thought which is bound up with it, are of a far larger extent than that which is bound up with the title of Messiah. We have seen the church founded on the confession of the Son of God, because there is found the life whereby it lives and the principle of its relations with the Father; but, as Son of man, Christ is the heir of man, and that according to the counsels of God as regards man, and not only according to the extent of the dominion of Adam. It is quite another idea and another position from heir of David, whatever may have been His glory in this character. (See Psalm 8.)

		The nation was judged, and its restoration foretold, when its heart should be prepared to receive Him whom God had sent; but the disciples were not yet instructed in the circumstances which should take place in the interval, nor was their heart separated from the glory of the former order of things.<a name=44:1></a> This chapter brings us to the communications of Christ on this subject, and furnishes the warnings necessary to the faithful remnant.<a name=44:2></a>

		The first thing that Jesus announces to them is the judgment of God upon that which existed at that time before their eyes, and of which the disciples had such an exalted idea.<a name=44:3></a> There should not remain there one stone on another.<a name=44:4></a> The Lord being seated on the mount of Olives, His disciples come to Him.<a name=44:5></a> That which the Lord had said to them suggested this question, or rather, these questions: When will these things take place, namely, the destruction of the temple?<a name=44:6></a> What will be the sign of Thy coming, and of the end of the age?<a name=44:7></a>

		We must remember, that the age for the disciples, was not Christianity, but, on the contrary, the state of Judaism, until the coming of the Messiah; so that these things were connected in their mind.<a name=45:1></a> The Lord had spoken of the destruction of the temple, which has more or less connection with the same thought; nevertheless it is rather the revelation which the Lord had made thereupon that gave rise to the questions which had already pre-occupied their mind.<a name=45:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In His answer He does not touch upon the first of these questions, namely, the era of the destruction of the temple.<a name=45:3></a> In fact that did not concern them; for that temple was as nothing for them now in the eyes of the Lord.<a name=45:4></a> He considers their position in two points of view, namely, the <i>general</i> point of view, according to which they found themselves in a position of witness; and the <i>special</i> point of view, when the abomination of desolation would be at Jerusalem.<a name=45:5></a> The first extends to the end of the thirteenth verse; the second from the fifteenth verse to the twenty-eighth.<a name=45:6></a>

		The first thing that the Lord points out is, that the ruin in which His departure was to leave Jerusalem would give place to many false Christs, which would come in His name.<a name=45:7></a> The disciples must not suffer themselves to be deceived by them.<a name=45:8></a> There would be also wars and rumours of wars,<a href="#45:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> but they must not be disturbed by them; these things must take place, but the end would not be yet.<a name=45:9></a> For nation would rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there would be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes in divers places, and all these things would only be the beginning of sorrows.<a name=45:10></a> Such is the outside, the providential events of which they would have knowledge.<a name=45:11></a>

		This fourteenth verse is taken quite alone as a fact which is to happen before the end of this age is come on earth.<a name=46:2></a> Here then the Lord, though He may have given warnings useful for His disciples, as Christians, in those days, takes the same starting-point as they take in their questions, and returns to the point whither their thoughts tended, without correcting anything as to this tendency.<a name=46:3></a> He interests Himself as to the same things; He does not own, it is true, the nation and the temple as they then existed; but He does not seek to raise their hopes to heaven.<a name=46:4></a> He supposes that their connections always subsist with the earth, with Israel, but according to God; as a remnant, and as having the testimony of God in the midst of all that.<a name=46:5></a> It is just what happened.<a name=46:6></a> during part of their life; then that was, as it were, eclipsed by the church, but it will be fully accomplished in the latter times, at the beginning of the travail of bringing forth, which will introduce the end of the age.<a name=46:7></a>

		Therefore, at the fifteenth verse, the Lord determines the thing plainly by a date, or at least by an event which is local, and which has a known relation with the end; and here is the second part of His discourse, where all is marked with precision.<a name=47:1></a> The abomination of desolation, <i>of which Daniel</i> has spoken, will be placed in the holy place; and here we must refer entirely to Daniel ("whoso readeth, let him understand"), that is to say, that this has reference to what will happen at Jerusalem and in those countries, in this locality definitely, and to nothing else, and that in the latter days.<a name=47:2></a> When this will happen, the disciples, instructed by the prophecy, are to flee.<a name=47:3></a> Here the hope is entirely Jewish.<a name=47:4></a> It is evident that it is not for me to save my life in flying from Jerusalem; that the aim of the Christian is no more that flesh should be saved, that is to say, that his life here below should be spared.<a name=47:5></a> In a word, they are Jews, having faith, but in Jewish circumstances, thoughts and intelligence.<a name=47:6></a> They were to pray to God that their flight might not be on the Sabbath day, etc.<a name=47:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Meanwhile, dear reader, see what tenderness, of God in the midst of these scenes of horror, which, if the hand of God was not extended in grace, should spare no flesh!<a name=47:8></a> See the majesty of the heavens, which deigns to think of the time that He will provide for the flight of His poor creatures and of the Sabbath which might shackle them!<a name=47:9></a> But here there is a very important remark to make, which is that the Lord says, Your flight, and When <i>ye</i> shall see, that is to say, that, although the circumstances might alter, He always regards His disciples under their Jewish character.<a name=47:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		From the fifteenth verse of chapter 24, it is evident that the Lord addresses Himself to them as to the same as those of whom the question is in the preceding verses: "Take heed that no one deceive you" (verse 4); "when <i>ye</i>, therefore, shall see" (verse 15); that is, He views His disciples as Jewish disciples in connection with the nation, as He had done towards the nation itself in the preceding chapter, verse 37, where He identifies it with the nation in the latter days, " <i>Ye</i> shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.<a name=47:11></a>" Nevertheless, there is in the circumstances a sufficiently important difference.<a name=47:12></a> He supposes the death of many during the first period without date.<a name=47:13></a> When the abomination is there, it is a question of saving one's life.<a name=47:14></a> In these beginnings of sorrows, which have no fixed date, but which suppose Jewish disciples in Palestine, betrayed by one another and hated by the Gentiles, the hope of many is to be founded still more upon the resurrection than upon the deliverance wrought by the advent of the Messiah.<a name=47:15></a> The Psalms (which present to my mind the relations with the Jews, of Christ considered either as the just man, or as the King on Zion) speak either of Himself prophetically, or of the faithful remnant, animated by His Spirit with more or less intelligence, and of His circumstances in the latter days.<a name=47:16></a>

		Now, the book of Psalms is divided into five parts, which treat each of a different subject.<a name=48:1></a> In the first the hope of resurrection is very frequently found there; in the others, almost more; in all is seen the expectation of deliverance; but in the first this expectation is passed beyond, which has hardly place in the others.<a name=48:2></a> Now, from the beginning of the second part, the Spirit of Christ, in the remnant, speaks as having been forced to abandon Jerusalem, of which the remembrance is precious to Him.<a name=48:3></a> He appeals from it to God against the Gentiles in Psalm 42; and against the ungodly Jews in Psalm 43.<a name=48:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is very evident that the disciples, to whom Jesus addressed Himself, while they had, at the moment of His speaking with them, Jewish hopes, enjoyed at a later period the hope of the resurrection, and more beyond; but He speaks to them here according to their actual position before Him, and, as Prophet, He declares to them what concerned the <i>faithful remnant</i> of the people <i>called to bear testimony</i>, as in the preceding chapter He had shewn them the fate of the <i>nation</i>.<a name=48:5></a> The disciples were those "of understanding," of Daniel 11 and 12, who are called here to understand that of which the intelligence is promised them in those chapters.<a name=48:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The warnings for the time of testimony are then given to the end of the thirteenth verse, and, having announced the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom among all nations, at least among all those of the prophetic (habitable) earth, we have from the fifteenth the instructions of Jesus for the time of the last twelve hundred and sixty days.<a name=48:7></a> Then will the false Christs seduce, if it were possible, even the elect; but the coming of the Son of man will be like the lightning, for where the carcase is, there, as the flight of the eagle, will fall the judgment of God.<a name=48:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Firstly, the circumstances of which He has just been speaking.<a name=49:8></a> When all these things shall come to pass, His coming and the end of the age will be at the door; secondly, the <i>actual generation</i> of the Jews shall not pass away till all these things should be accomplished.<a name=49:9></a> There are circumstances for them that understand.<a name=49:10></a> As to dates, if the day or hour be inquired of, the Father alone knew them.<a name=49:11></a><a href="#49:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a>

		If the day is not known save to the Father alone, that accords, I think, with what is said in Psalm 110: "Sit thou at my right hand until I make thine enemies thy footstool.<a name=50:5></a>" The Lord, who expects all here below as servant of His Father, has received but this word at His mouth, "until.<a name=50:6></a>" Nothing shall fail, no uncertainty in the events, not one word that has proceeded out of His mouth shall fall to the ground.<a name=50:7></a> As to the moment, it would be as in the days of Noah; that is to say, a sudden judgment, and unexpected on the earth; they should be overtaken by it, when they should least expect it.<a name=50:8></a> Yet the Lord will know how to distinguish them, and to leave those whom He should think worthy, even though two men should be in the same field, or two women at the same mill.<a name=50:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But it may be asked, how it is that the Lord identifies His apostles with the rebellious Jews, who will be overtaken by the judgment; and since the church is to ascend to Him in the air, how can it happen that two shall be found in the same field in the day of the Son of man?<a name=50:11></a> It is true, this will not happen for the church, as it is <i>very certain that it did not happen for the apostles to whom these words were addressed</i>; but in this discourse the Lord speaks to no one individually, but to classes, to certain categories of people.<a name=50:12></a> We have an evident proof of it in verse 39 of chapter 23 touching the Jews, and in verse 15 of chapter 24 touching the disciples.<a name=50:13></a> "When <i>ye</i> shall see the abomination of desolation," etc.<a name=50:14></a> It is certain that the disciples had never seen it; it is even certain, from the book of Daniel, that it refers to the last days.<a name=50:15></a> The comparison of the twenty-first verse with the commencement of chapter 12 of Daniel, then the date attached to this event at the end of this last chapter, demonstrate it with the plainest evidence.<a name=50:16></a>

		Thus then, in the twenty-third chapter, as here, the Lord speaks of certain classes of persons: and here, of the faithful remnant of the Jews.<a name=51:1></a> It is true that those who composed this faithful remnant at that time were in the enjoyment of privileges far superior to the position here in question; but the Lord is not speaking of this now.<a name=51:2></a> He is occupied with the remnant, and He could speak to His apostles under this aspect, because they were in that moment the remnant, and put by the nation in the presence of the rejection of the Messiah, whatever may have been the superior privileges which afterwards they may have individually enjoyed.<a name=51:3></a>

		All this supposes a gospel of the kingdom, specially preached in the last times; as moreover it supposes persons who will be persecuted for Christ's name's sake, but who, at the same time, will be more or less identified with Jewish hopes, who will even be of the Jewish remnant; and I believe the word tells us so.<a name=51:4></a> I see, at the end of Isaiah and of Daniel, chosen ones distinguished from the mass of those who shall be spared; but they are Jews, they occupy themselves with Jewish interests, and they will enjoy the deliverance of this people and the blessings which will result from it on earth.<a name=51:5></a> See Daniel 10, 11, 12.<a name=51:6></a> Isaiah 65, 66.<a name=51:7></a> It appears that some will be put to death, whether during the period called the beginning of sorrows, or during the last tribulation.<a name=51:8></a>

		But this leads our divine Master to consider the remnant under another aspect, that the disciples scarce understood then, that is, its relations no longer with Israel and the hopes of this people, but with Himself; in other words, to consider this remnant as charged with His service, as the retinue of His joy, come forth to await His return, or finally, as charged with His interests here below in His absence.<a name=52:4></a> This is what follows from chapter 24: 45, to 25: 30.<a name=52:5></a> In the first case, it does but present the position and the effect of fidelity during His absence, and the manner in which unbelief would identify itself with the state of heart which puts off the thought of His return.<a name=52:6></a> If, during the absence of the Master, a true service is yielded by the wise and faithful servant (it is not a question here of "good") who keeps his place to accomplish, in care bestowed upon those who compose the household,<a href="#52:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> that which was entrusted him in the house, blessed is that servant; at the time of the return of the Master, he will be made ruler over all His goods.<a name=52:7></a> Here this is a great principle of service to which the apostles were called -- true for their service in Christianity, and applicable also for each of us in his place.<a name=52:8></a> But the position and the principle only are laid down here.<a name=52:9></a> If there was infidelity, if the servant put off the thought of the return of the Master, and went on his way with those who made themselves drunken in the world, he should be counted among the hypocrites and taken in an hour when he least expected it.<a name=52:10></a>

That is necessary where individual responsibility is in question. What was important here was to shew that disciples left as Jews would be in the same joy as their Master, when He should return in glory as Son of man, being no longer a Jew, though fulfilling the promises made to the fathers. But His servants should be in the same position as Himself, not as He had left them when He went away, and His joy would be the glory. Yet it would be found also in accomplishing His promises to His people, however it might have been. But the question was not exactly about possessing cities.

		<a class="footnote" name="#59:f2"><sup>++</sup></a>It is not that He indicates the day. As Jehovah had said to the Lord, "Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool"; so the Lord said, "Ye shall not see me henceforth until." etc. The repentance of the Jews is for His heart the sign that He can see them again and that they also can see Him again. Peter gives them the same sign, in Acts 3. "Be converted ... *so that* the times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and that he may send Jesus Christ." <p>We see here the importance of the repentance of the Jews as a nation, for thousands since that time have repented as individuals. This repentance is to have respect to the sent One of God, for it is to be repentance for the sin which has caused their ruin and their rejection. They will say, "Blessed is He that cometh!" a word which follows these, "The stone which the builders rejected is become the head-stone of the corner. This is Jehovah's doing, it is marvellous in our eyes," Psalm 118. This explains also why the Lord, at His coming, has yet a great deal to do to place the Jews in full peace and prosperity, according to the figure of Solomon. This is because He takes up the Jews where He left them, not such as they were in the days of Solomon, or onward to the captivity of Babylon as with Judah. But He can identify Himself with them; this is what He could not do at His first coming, because they would not. He had besides other things to accomplish according to the counsels of God. Now, when they have repented of their last national fault, and they say, "Blessed is He that cometh," He can *undertake their cause*; and this is what He does, and it is not a small thing. The indignation will have ceased; but the thing is to put the remnant-nation in the possession of all their privileges and all their country. It is the work of Messiah when He is there, and of none other. Zechariah, Joel, Isaiah, and Jeremiah, speak of these things. There is then the action of the word of God by the Spirit, on the hearts of the Jews, as Jews, before the appearing of Jesus, which action will leave them Jews; and on the other hand, the acts of power, He having recognised the nation, to put them in possession of all their privileges after the appearing. Read Isaiah 50 and 51 for the first of these things and the transition See Psalms 42 to 49, and Zechariah 9. The moment of transition is found in chapter 12. See also Jeremiah 51: 20; Isaiah 41: 15, 16; Mic. 4: 13; 5; Isaiah 40: 10 -- 14.

		Here, in order to make the application of the passage precise, Christ does not merely come, but it is told us that, when He will come, He will sit upon the throne of His glory; whilst it will be as lightning that He will come to put an end to the tribulation and the desolation which the abomination has caused.<a name=61:4></a> He had set the faithful servant over all His goods: those who have their portion with the hypocrites, the wicked and slothful servants have been cast outside when they waited not for Him; but here Jesus takes His place upon His throne.<a name=61:5></a> There is no more a question nor a doubt about His rights nor about the submission of all to the ends of the earth.<a name=61:6></a> He is now "the King" (verse 34).<a name=61:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There are in this scene three classes of persons: the goats, the sheep, and His brethren.<a name=61:8></a> The judgment of the two first classes depends on their conduct toward the third.<a name=61:9></a> To have done these things to one of His brethren is to have done them to Himself; not to have done them to one of the least of these is not to have done them to Himself.<a name=61:10></a> The "brethren," I have no doubt, will be the remnant who will have preached the gospel of the kingdom among the Gentiles; the reception given to those messengers decides the lot of those who appear now in judgment.<a name=61:11></a> No more do I doubt that they are Jews who will bear this testimony, and whom Jesus calls His brethren, at this time; as those to whom He spoke, and that, after His resurrection, He calls His brethren, according to Psalm 22.<a name=61:12></a> I know very well that the Gentiles were grafted in later, but the Lord speaks according to that which resulted already from the fact that the disciples followed Him at that time rejected; and He employs this expression to mark those who among the Jews should be in the latter days in a kindred position of testimony.<a name=61:13></a> In principle, the disciples might apply it to themselves, and the Lord would have them know well that one day He should be King, and all the Gentiles should be forced to appear in judgment before Him, the rejected Messiah, and that they should enjoy all that which the Jews hoped as to the glory of their Messiah.<a name=61:14></a>

		The brethren of Jesus, according to the constant language of the passages where this expression is employed, are the believing Jews, the remnant that believed in the Messiah (it is clear that all the Gentile believers have been admitted to the same privilege); but in this passage Jesus occupies Himself with those who surrounded Him, to encourage and direct them.<a name=62:1></a> As King He judges on earth.<a name=62:2></a> Those among the Gentiles who received well the brethren of Jesus enjoy, as blessed of the Father, the kingdom He had prepared for them from the foundation of the world; having received the gospel of the kingdom, they enjoy the effect of their faith, namely, the kingdom itself.<a name=62:3></a> Those who preached it, having been in the position of Jesus in testimony, will be recognised as His <i>brethren</i> in the blessing.<a name=62:4></a> But He is now King come on earth, so that His brethren are recognised here below; those put to death will have part in the first resurrection, but such is not the subject treated of here.<a name=62:5></a> The King is on earth, the nations on earth; so that there is nothing which can make it supposed that the brethren spoken of here are of heaven.<a name=62:6></a><a href="#62:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> There will be those, but here it appears to me that they are rather the messengers of the kingdom, who have been preserved in spite of all the difficulties of the time.<a name=62:7></a>

		After having given us the future prospect of the remnant in all respects, the Spirit resumes the history of the events, and presents us with the recital, at once painful and touching, but for us infinitely precious, of the sufferings and of the resurrection of the Saviour.<a name=63:1></a> I do not think, dear brethren, of entering into many details of these chapters, because that which is here demanded is adoration, is the heart, rather than exegesis.<a name=63:2></a> I will only point out some particular points which belong to the character of this Gospel.<a name=63:3></a> And, first, some words on what the Lord says in giving the cup.<a name=63:4></a> It is good to remember that we eat the given body of Christ.<a name=63:5></a> One with Him in His glorious state, it is not of that we partake in the supper.<a name=63:6></a> Enjoying vitally this position infinitely exalted, we <i>remember</i> the sufferings which have purchased it for us; our hearts, our consciences, our souls, are nourished with the broken body; it is to Jesus dead that our thoughts recur, and to a love more powerful than death.<a name=63:7></a> If the body had not been broken, as Gentiles we should even have remained strangers as regards the promises, and sinners destitute of all hope.<a name=63:8></a>

		A living Messiah was the crown of glory for the Jews; but, if He is lifted up from the earth, He draws <i>all</i> men.<a name=63:9></a> His broken body is the door for sinners from the Gentiles.<a name=63:10></a> On this the heart of the Christian is nourished, not merely as on manna come down from heaven, which typifies Jesus, a man upon earth, nor on Jesus in the heavens (where we are one with Him) -- it is there the hidden manna; but on this devoted victim of propitiation which I see brought to the altar, and there sacrificed, slain for us -- a victim full of love and of devotedness.<a name=63:11></a>

		I pause before this mysterious scene, where He all alone (for no man could be there save to bend his head and adore) where the victim of propitiation, the man Jesus, presents Himself before the face of Him who, in His offended majesty, comes out to take cognizance of sin, in order that we might find on the tracks of the righteousness of God, which has burst forth and is accomplished, nothing but an infinite and immutable love: the love of the Father, enhanced by the accomplishment of the eternal righteousness to His glory.<a name=64:1></a> It is then the precious Saviour, humbled to death, that we have here, His body given (and one could not go lower down), and His blood shed out of His body.<a name=64:2></a> In that manifestly it is not a question of Jesus, such as He is at the present time; for He is glorified.<a name=64:3></a> This natural life He has left for us.<a name=64:4></a> He only presents it to God as a thing already given elsewhere; but He speaks here of a double effect of this blood which He has shed; first, He speaks of it as the foundation, or at least the seal, of the new covenant; and, secondly, as the foundation of the remission of the sins of many.<a name=64:5></a> That is, the basis of the new covenant is now laid, and, moreover, it is not a question of an act which relates to Jesus only to shew His obedience: this blood is efficacious for the sins of others.<a name=64:6></a> That does not merely secure new privileges, which one enjoys as a Christian, but procures the pardon of the sins of many of the Jews -- not only so, but, in a general manner, of many.<a name=64:7></a> As to the new covenant, I will say some words here.<a name=64:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The old covenant, it is clear, is the covenant made with the Jews at Sinai.<a name=64:9></a> The Gentiles are not there for anything.<a name=64:10></a> The new one refers to the old; it will be established really with Judah and Israel, according to the prophecy of Jeremiah (chapter 31: 31-34).<a name=64:11></a> What then have we to do with the new alliance, we other Gentiles, may we ask ourselves?<a name=64:12></a> This is the answer.<a name=64:13></a> It is clear that the covenant itself treats with the Jews and with Israel, but upon principles of grace, and based upon blood of perfect efficacy before God.<a name=64:14></a> Now, for the moment, Israel is put aside as a nation.<a name=64:15></a> It enjoys no covenant.<a name=64:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What then is the state of things with respect to the covenant?<a name=64:17></a> It is that the Mediator of the covenant has shed His blood, and thus the basis of the covenant is laid: it is confirmed and established immutable before God.<a name=64:18></a> Christ is ascended on high, and we are one with Him, enjoying all the effect which is essentially attached to His person and to His position.<a name=64:19></a> We have the blood of the covenant.<a name=64:20></a> Those who are called to it exercise the ministry of the new covenant.<a name=64:21></a> Our position is to be united with the Mediator of the new covenant, and to enjoy all the privileges which He enjoys Himself, as having it established in His blood; though the covenant is not formed with us, it is established in Him before God, and we, we are in Him here below.<a name=64:22></a> What is the consequence of it?<a name=64:23></a> We drink of blood.<a name=64:24></a> If a Jew had drunk of blood under old covenant, it was death: could a man be nourished on death?<a name=64:25></a> It is the fruit of sin, it is his condemnation, it is the wrath of God, as the blood in the body was the life; and a Jew had no right to that.<a name=64:26></a> But Christ has suffered death.<a name=64:27></a> And can the Christian be nourished on death?<a name=64:28></a> Yes; it is salvation, the death of sin, the infinite proof of love.<a name=64:29></a> It is his life, the peace of his soul, the deliverance from sin, before God.<a name=64:30></a> What a difference!<a name=64:31></a> We drink of His blood, the proof of salvation and of grace, and the source of life.<a name=64:32></a> Nevertheless it is Jesus dead, of whom it is a question here.<a name=64:33></a>

		There is in Hebrews 13: 20, another expression to which allusion may be made: God has "brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant.<a name=65:1></a>" This shews us that Christ Himself is above, and has been raised according to the efficaciousness of the blood that He has shed to satisfy the glory of God.<a name=65:2></a> He, the only and beloved Son of the Father, charged Himself with our responsibility and our sins, and thus with the glory of God in this respect; and if this glory had not been completely satisfied, He could not evidently either rise again, or appear before Him whose majesty required that nothing should fail to the work.<a name=65:3></a> But He accomplished this work gloriously, and in that the Son of man has been glorified, and God <i>glorified in Him</i>; and He is ascended on high, not only as Son of God, but according to the efficaciousness of His work, in virtue of which He appears before the Father, the everlasting covenant being thus established in His blood.<a name=65:4></a> The question here is not of an old or a new covenant, which refers to particular circumstances, but of the intrinsic and essential worth of the blood of Christ.<a name=65:5></a> But perhaps I go too far away from our Gospel; I allow myself to be drawn away by the importance of the subject, and also by the precious worth and glory of the work of Him who has so much loved us.<a name=65:6></a>

		I return now to the more humble precincts of my labour.<a name=66:1></a> We see here that the Spirit declares the value of the blood in a general way; it is shed for many for the remission of sins.<a name=66:2></a> The Gospel which treats of the kingdom, and of the Messiah in the Jewish point of view, must necessarily shew that the death of Christ had another aspect.<a name=66:3></a> In Luke, where this distinction was not obligatory, because of the non-Jewish character of his Gospel, it is said: "My blood which is shed <i>for you</i>.<a name=66:4></a>" We have then the blood of the new covenant and the remission of sins.<a name=66:5></a> The disciples were to drink of it, as they were also to eat of His <i>given</i> body.<a name=66:6></a> Such is their portion: to be nourished on the death of Jesus, and to shew it till He come.<a name=66:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Until then, He would drink no more with them of the fruit of the vine.<a name=66:8></a> They would be nourished on Him, but He would not be nourished with them.<a name=66:9></a> The fruit of the vine is the sign of social joy, "wine which cheereth the heart of God and man," which they continually sprinkled in the burnt-offerings and the peace-offerings, that is to say, of a sweet savour.<a name=66:10></a> (See Numbers 15: 5, 7, 10, where the question is not of offering for sin.<a name=66:11></a>) Now, of this fruit of the vine He would drink no more, whilst His disciples should drink abundantly of His death, the true drink, but a drink of separation from sin, and of Christ also, as regards His personal presence; the heavens must receive Him until the time of restitution of all things of which the prophets had spoken.<a name=66:12></a> Thus His social life with His disciples here below was closed; it would no more even be renewed after the same manner.<a name=66:13></a> They would enter spiritually into the power of His death, and would be one day anew with Him in joy in the kingdom of His Father.<a name=66:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Luke, this is expressed in a manner a little different.<a name=66:15></a> It is said: "I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God shall come"; and of the passover: "I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.<a name=66:16></a>" Here the things are much more left in general forms, because it is not occupied with the order of the dispensations of God on earth, but with the moral principles which are bound up with the introduction in grace of the new man.<a name=66:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Matthew 26: 53 we have a circumstance which belongs particularly to this Gospel; it was just the right of Jesus, as Messiah, the Son of God, to have angels at His disposal.<a name=66:18></a> In chapter 27: 25 we have the solemn and frightful execration which this poor blinded people pronounces on itself, and which still weighs upon it to this day -- an execration which will nevertheless be blotted out by grace, and the power of this same blood which they shed in their blindness, and which refers specially to the subject of this Gospel: "His blood be on us, and on our children!<a name=66:19></a>" Terrible words!<a name=66:20></a> O what then the heart of blinded man!<a name=66:21></a> Their entire apostasy from their position is more plainly delineated in John, who, besides, always presents them thus, "We have no king but Caesar," say they.<a name=66:22></a> Here it is their chastisement, as a nation, from the hand of God, which they invoke upon their head.<a name=66:23></a> They are owned in chastisement.<a name=66:24></a> Compare Isaiah 40.<a name=66:25></a>

		If the reader compare the account Luke gives us of this moment so solemn to us all, he will find that there they are the moral circumstances which are related; here, those which refer to the degradation of the Messiah.<a name=67:1></a> The daughters of Jerusalem lament over Him; His prayer for His murderers, the conversion of the thief are found in Luke.<a name=67:2></a> If we examine John, we find the details of the sufferings omitted.<a name=67:3></a> The Spirit has there kept that which brings out the dignity of Him who traversed in grace, and according to the glory of His person, whatever might be otherwise His humiliation, those painful but precious moments,<a href="#67:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> precious for the present, as well as for eternity; for it is with the glory of His person, as Son of God, that the Gospel of John is specially occupied.<a name=67:4></a>

		I will not pause longer on these circumstances, but I invite my brethren to meditate upon them.<a name=67:5></a> The more we are penetrated with them, the more also our poor and feeble hearts will appreciate the Saviour whom we love, but whom no one knows as He is worthy of being known.<a name=67:6></a> There are yet, in this chapter 27, the circumstances of verses 52, 53; circumstances important in this respect, that they bear testimony to the manner in which the Spirit of God treats Jerusalem, as being the holy city, when it is completely abandoned as regards the judgment of God.<a name=67:7></a> It may be forgotten for a moment, trampled under the feet of the Gentiles; but if the eye of God takes cognizance of it, in His eyes it is ever the holy city.<a name=67:8></a> The bodies of the saints come out of their graves after the resurrection of Jesus, and enter into the holy city.<a name=67:9></a> The death and resurrection of Jesus had abolished for heaven the middle wall of partition; but this does not hinder it (though, as regards His government, God had given up to chastisement the holy city, because it was not holy) from always keeping in His eyes that position; for He has chosen Jerusalem, and He will not repent of it.<a name=67:10></a> The same thing is seen in Daniel (compare especially chapter 9): faith thinks and speaks always thus.<a name=67:11></a>

		But here, in Matthew, we have a rejected crucified Messiah, who, for the moment, abandons Jerusalem to its folly and its sin, and who, now risen, sends to the nations the message that His death, His resurrection, and the gift of the Father to Him risen, have enabled Him to put into the mouth of His disciples a message (no longer suitable to the Jews, who have already rejected the subject of it, their Messiah).<a name=73:3></a> It is no longer simply the only true God in His unity, surrounded by a people which should have kept this good and precious deposit.<a name=73:4></a> Now, other things in God had been put in the light for men, things which opened the door to the Gentiles, or rather which could be sent to them.<a name=73:5></a> Christ could not be there without the Son being named, and if the Son, then the Father and the Holy Spirit (the Holy Spirit, who acted with efficacy in the communication of the knowledge of the Father and of the Son); and, on the other hand, both the Father and the Holy Spirit had been necessarily manifested in Christ and His acts, while He lived and acted on earth; for in being Messiah, He was also Son, and it was because He called Himself such that the Jews rejected Him.<a name=73:6></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#73:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>It appears to me that an example of this is found in the choice of Matthias, before the gift of the Holy Spirit -- a choice based on the explanation of Psalm 109; an explanation of which, it would seem to me, the disciples would have been incapable before that time, but the act itself had nothing in it of the power of the Holy Spirit. They draw lots, as Jews, after having understood this Psalm. Though we have received the Holy Ghost, it is of importance for us to distinguish between the understanding (though it were a gift) and power. It is evident, from the end of Luke and the commencement of the Acts, that a person may have the one and not have the other.

		<a class="footnote" name="#73:f2"><sup>++</sup></a>There was, in this, a revelation evidently much clearer, and relations different from those which the Jews enjoyed, as the people of Jehovah. These terms were not entirely unknown to the Jews; but they were always employed by the *prophets* in the prospect of the times when there would be this clearer revelation to call the Gentiles, and when blessing would be manifested for the Jews in a new measure. "Kiss the Son" is a summons to the kings of the earth in Psalm 2, and the promise of the outpouring of the Spirit, whether upon the Jews and their posterity or upon all flesh, is sufficiently known. See, amongst others, in Joel; in Isaiah 44: 3; see also chapter 48: 16. Before the accomplishment of these things, or at least before they are fully accomplished to the letter, the revelation has been made of what is their foundation in God, and this name of Father, of Son, and of Holy Spirit has been proclaimed amongst the Gentiles. I do not think that it is here the unity of the Son with the Father, and of the church with Jesus by the Holy Spirit (that is taught elsewhere); but the revelation of the name of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, for the submission of the Gentiles by faith, in anticipation of that day when the Son will be manifested in power, and the Holy Spirit fully shed abroad. But this is very precious for us, because it shews us these things in God, and makes us see that there are not only certain acts of manifestation which will take place hereafter, but the truth of God, of which one can speak before these manifestations take place. For the knowledge which the Jews and the earth will have of the Son, for example in His reign according to Psalm 2 is very inferior, it seems to me, to the knowledge which we have of Him, as being in the Father and the Father in Him, one with the Father, hidden in God. It is the same person, undoubtedly, but we have a much deeper knowledge of what He is. Further, we learn, in thus comparing Psalm 2, that the preaching of the name of the Son does not necessarily suppose the blessings of the church: now it does, because God gathers the church in Him; but the call made to the kings to submit to the royalty of Christ in the last times is made in the name of the Son, "Kiss the Son, lest he be angry." We have acknowledged Him before through grace, and we know Him as one with the Father. In this Psalm it is spoken of Him as presented to the world in time, "To-day I have begotten thee."

		But this mission depends on the power of Jesus as being given, and is to subject the nations that they may be His disciples, according to the claims that this power conferred on Him.<a name=74:1></a> It was a mission <i>belonging yet to the age</i>, which, though the Messiah had been rejected, was not yet terminated; it looked consequently at the submission of the Gentiles to the Messiah, in a new way, it is true, and left Jerusalem aside, because it had rejected the Messiah; but it supposes a going forward in the ways of God towards the end of this age, before which the gospel is to be preached in the whole habitable world.<a name=74:2></a> Those who carried this message might have higher privileges, which would be made evident when the Lord would be removed, and their first testimony rejected; those same messengers, individually, might be charged, from the commencement, with the message of the grace which was in Jesus, according to the other forms of mission that we have seen in the three other Gospels: they might preach the gospel to every creature, beginning at Jerusalem as representatives of Him who was exalted at the right hand of God, or remit the sins, on the part of Him who said, "Peace be unto you"; but it is none the less true that the speciality of the mission found in this Gospel is a mission to the nations from Jesus, speaking as the rejected Messiah, who has now all power, leaving aside Jerusalem, and mentioning the continuation of this age; promising to be with the witnesses to the end of this age, and saying nothing, either of the church, or of heaven, or of the Holy Spirit given, or of the deliverance from this present evil age, or of the privilege of not being of this world as the Son of God was not of it; but speaking of subjecting the Gentiles to the ordinances of Christ, in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, to bring the age to its close, according to the promise of Him who should be with them till then.<a name=74:3></a><a href="#74:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>

	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#74:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>One may examine Psalm 95 (and also Psalms 91 to 100), which treats of these times, as well as Daniel 11: 33 and 12: 3, 9; Isaiah 65: 13, etc., where, however, the testimony is rather practical than in word. Here is the connection of this subject in *Isaiah*, which may interest those who search the word; and it is only for such that I give it. <p>God desires to comfort His people (Isaiah 40); and in the midst of present deliverances (pledges of better ones to come), the servant, Christ, is introduced, chapter 42. Israel should have been so, but was blind; nevertheless he should be delivered, being forgiven. Cyrus and Babylon pass then before our eyes, to the end of chapter 48, the pledge of better deliverances, as we have said. God announces, notwithstanding, that He distinguishes the wicked: there is no peace for them. <p>Chapter 49, the Gentiles are summoned by *Israel* as called of God to be a servant, in whom God should be glorified. Thereupon the Messiah says, "I have then laboured in vain"; nevertheless His judgment and work were with God. The Spirit answers that it was a small thing to raise up Israel, that He should be a light to the Gentiles. From that time it is Christ, the true vine, who holds the promises as a faithful servant. Chapter 50 explains the dismissal of Israel for the rejection of Christ, Jehovah God who had made Himself a servant; and thereupon is brought out the distinction of the remnant who fear Jehovah and obey the voice of *His servant*, not here the church in the joy of the Son, though that has been true of a certain number from among the remnant In these passages the church finds itself only as hidden in the person of Christ Himself; which will be seen in comparing Isaiah 50: 8, 9, and Romans 8: 33, 34, where the apostle applies to the church the substance of those verses which speak of Christ in Isaiah. I will observe, by the way, that the Lausanne translation, in general very faithful to the letter, has spoilt these verses in the form it has given to them. Here, I believe, is the true contrast. God justifies; who shall condemn? Christ is dead, etc.: who shall separate us from the love of Christ? The Old Testament does not take up the union of Christ and the church: here it is the remnant that obey the voice of the *servant* of God, of Christ, come as Messiah here below. Nevertheless the obedient walk in darkness. Consolation is given them, a consolation properly Jewish, by calls (chapter 51: 1-4, 7), in which there is progress in their position (verse 9). They themselves call, by the Spirit of prophecy, the arm of Jehovah to awake. He answers at last (verse 17), summons Jerusalem to awake in her turn, and (chapter 52) to clothe herself with glory and honour. This passage, ending at verse 12, is all beautiful. Chapters 52: 13, and 53 give the expiatory character of the work of the "servant," recognised by the Jews in the latter days. Then come the details of blessings (chapters 54, 55, 56, 57), and of the ways of God, and of what hinders, namely, the deep iniquity of the people in the latter days. <p>From chapter 58, testimony is strongly borne to this iniquity, which finally forces Jehovah to arise (chapter 59: 15, 16, etc.), and the Deliverer comes to Sion according to Romans 11: 26. Then in chapter 60, Jerusalem is glorified, and the same subject (introducing, in order to identify His person in the two advents, what Christ was at His first, chapter 61: 1, and the first half of verse 2), and the judgment of the Gentiles, are treated to the end of chapter 63: 6. Then, upon the touching call of the prophet, there is a detailed explanation of all their ways, how grace had seized the occasion, given by the folly of Israel, to be found of those who sought it not, whilst He had ever stretched out His hands towards rebellious Israel (quoted by the apostle, Romans 10: 20, 21), which explains these same points. And here, finally, we find a special remnant (all those who are spared; see Isaiah 66: 19, 20), treated as the "servants" to whom the blessing of all the nation would be a particular subject of joy. Such is what has led us to this summary of the latter part of this prophetic book: the special remnant owned of God, but having all its affections in the well-being of Jerusalem and of Israel. One may, for the last testimony to the Gentiles, compare Psalm 97 and Revelation 14: 6, 7. <p>The key of this summary of Isaiah 40-48 is *Israel the servant:* -- nevertheless, no peace for the wicked. *Christ, the true servant*, is rejected. The remnant, true servants, are owned in that; they obey the voice of the "servant," but in prospect of Jewish interests. Translate chapter 49: 3, "Thou art my servant, O Israel, he in whom I will be glorified."

		<a class="footnote" name="#79:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>Perhaps there may be trouble to reconcile these two ideas,"abandoned," and yet "the object of the thoughts and judgments of God"; but it is precisely the position of Jerusalem in the latter days, when His work recommences with the earth. It will be desolate and abandoned until it says, "Blessed is he that cometh in the name of Jehovah!" But God acts with it in testimony, in chastisement, in indignation. Such was already the case in the time of the apostles. In chapter 23 of this Gospel, it was abandoned. Nevertheless the testimony and indignation are there. See upon that, in Zechariah, specially the end of chapter 11 and the beginning of chapter 12, and all his prophecy; the end of Daniel 9; 11 and 12 also, and Isaiah 65, 66; see also Jeremiah 30: 4, 8, etc. In these chapters, and in so many others, Jerusalem is not owned, but it is the object of God's thoughts and ways; according to the expressions as to Ephraim Jeremiah 31: 20, and as to Jerusalem itself, Isaiah 49: 14, etc. The fact is that Jerusalem is chosen as the Jewish people. Psalm 132: 13, 14. <p>We have a principle which is bound up with this, and which is very precious in its analogy for us. God, at the time of the Babylonish captivity, had written, *Lo-Ammi, not my people*. Notwithstanding that, in Haggai 2: 5 we find that the Spirit remained with them, as when they came out of Egypt. What encouragement for us, whatever may be the state of the church! If they had said, No, we are not in this state of Lo-Ammi, it would have been unbelief; if they had been discouraged, as if the Spirit was not with them, as at the departure from Egypt, it would have been practical unbelief also under another form. In the two cases, faith in the goodness and in the chastisement of God would have been lost.

		In the first three Gospels Christ is present to men, more particularly to the Jews, for the purpose of being received, and each of them closes with the account of His rejection.<a name=82:7></a> It is not so with John.<a name=82:8></a> From the first chapter we find the Lord rejected.<a name=82:9></a> He was in the world, and the world was made by Him, and the world knew Him not, He came to His own, and His own people received Him not.<a name=82:10></a> And in the following verses we see that it is grace which causes Him to be received by any.<a name=82:11></a> He is received by those who are born (not of the flesh, but) of God.<a name=82:12></a> In the entire Gospel the Jews are treated as reprobate, and the sovereign grace of the Father who draws and election are put forward.<a name=82:13></a> The sheep hear His voice.<a name=82:14></a> The Jews do not hear Him because they are not of His sheep.<a name=82:15></a> Moreover He is come from the Father, and come <i>into the world</i>.<a name=82:16></a> There is also no genealogy which goes up to the stock of promise in Abraham and David, no human genealogy which goes up to Adam (son) of God.<a name=82:17></a> It is God, the Word, who was with God and who was God; in whom was life, and the life the light of men, light shining in darkness which the darkness comprehended not; then the Word made flesh, God manifested here below.<a name=82:18></a> And all agrees with that: no agony in Gethsemane, nor cry on the cross.<a name=82:19></a> When the moment arrived, He delivers up His spirit, the hour being come to pass from this world to the Father.<a name=82:20></a> It is what He is that is presented to us in this Gospel; and, whether Jew or Gentile, we must be born anew.<a name=82:21></a> At the end the coming of the Holy Spirit, testimony before the world, is to replace Him among His own, for the world also is judged.<a name=82:22></a> John passes at the close to some ulterior manifestations of His glory on the earth in a manner designedly mysterious, and without any ascension scene.<a name=82:23></a> It is Himself, Son of man, but God manifested here below.<a name=82:24></a>

		The first three Gospels, we have said, relate the manner in which Christ was presented to men to be received, and His rejection, then His resurrection; Mark and Luke add His ascension.<a name=83:1></a> In Luke, after the most delicious picture of the little remnant faithful in the midst of the corruption of Israel, we find the Son of man and grace toward men by Him.<a name=83:2></a> The genealogy goes up to Adam; and He, the second Man, the last Adam, ascends to heaven from Bethany, blessing His own.<a name=83:3></a> The commission given to the apostles comes from heaven and embraces all, Jews and Gentiles.<a name=83:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Mark we find the servant and prophet.<a name=83:5></a> This Gospel begins with His ministry, preceded by that of John the Baptist.<a name=83:6></a> We find at the end His meeting with the disciples in Galilee after His resurrection as in Matthew; but besides an appendix from verse 9, in which what is found in Luke and even in John is briefly stated, that is to say, the heavenly side of these last events, and a commission given to the disciples more general and more universal.<a name=83:7></a> It carries salvation or condemnation to all the creation under heaven.<a name=83:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have reserved Matthew for the last of the Gospels because I must occupy myself with it in more detail.<a name=83:9></a> It presents to us Emmanuel, the Messiah, object of the promises and the prophecies, Jehovah in the midst of Israel, Saviour of His people but rejected as in Isaiah 49 and 50,<a href="#83:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> and His presence on earth replaced by the kingdom in mystery (chapter 13), by the church (chapter 16), the kingdom in glory (chapter 17); but, whilst insinuating the substitution of the church and of the kingdom, the principal subject is always the Lord in His relation with His earthly people, His meeting with His disciples after His resurrection in Galilee.<a name=83:10></a> They are sent to the Gentiles, and there is no ascension.<a name=83:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Consequently we begin quite naturally with the Son of David and the Son of Abraham.<a name=83:12></a> Jesus is viewed as the Heir of the promises, as the Son of David.<a name=83:13></a> We find ourselves in the atmosphere of the thoughts and the hopes of Israel, but of Israel's thoughts and hopes according to God.<a name=83:14></a> The genealogy is traced in the line of Joseph, from whom He inherited royalty according to the law.<a name=83:15></a> But His birth really of Mary presents facts evidently still more important, being close to His person as far as manifested on the earth.<a name=83:16></a> Save to draw the attention of the reader to them, these facts, all-important though they be, are so well known and so simply related that I have hardly need to enlarge on them.<a name=83:17></a> His human nature (conceived in the womb of the Virgin, without spot or stain, by the power of the Holy Spirit) is a thing perfectly holy; also it is, according to the flesh, born of God whilst being the Seed of the woman, true man in this world.<a name=83:18></a> And not this only.<a name=83:19></a> He was to be named Jesus (Joshua, or Jehoshea), Jehovah the Saviour, for He should save His people from their sins.<a name=83:20></a> As He was Jehovah, the people was His people.<a name=83:21></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#83:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>The second part of the prophecy of Isaiah, that is, chapters 40-47, speaks of the sin of the people with respect to the controversy of Jehovah with idols; chapters 49-58, the rejection of the Messiah; from chapter 59 the restoration of the people is the matter handled.

		Thus we have a man without sin and Jehovah manifested in flesh: a fact which is a proof of infinite grace, to which nothing is like, which abides alone in the annals of man as in the counsels of God.<a name=84:1></a> It is true that redemption was necessary, namely His death, in order that this fact should be available for men, and that the counsels of God should be accomplished.<a name=84:2></a> But all depended on the fact that God became man, that the Word was made flesh.<a name=84:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Never elsewhere had there been a man having perfectly knowledge of good and evil without sin, never divine perfection -- God Himself -- manifested in flesh, which will remain eternally true, and without which redemption itself could not have been accomplished.<a name=84:4></a> We shall find in all His life the perfect obedience of man, the perfect manifestation of God.<a name=84:5></a> Also He is owned of the prophecy in Isaiah 7, Emmanuel, God with us!<a name=84:6></a> and Joseph gives Him the name which was assigned Him by the angel, the name of Jesus.<a name=84:7></a> Thus according to the testimony of God He has taken His place in the midst of His people.<a name=84:8></a>

		But the nations were to hope in the Branch out of the root of Jesse (Isaiah 11: 1-10), and Magi from the East arrive to do homage to Him who is born King of the Jews.<a name=84:9></a> Already, from that tender age, must He know what it is to be rejected.<a name=84:10></a> The false king of Israel seeks to have Him put to death; and Joseph, directed peculiarly by God, takes Him to Egypt, whence He was to come up again, the true vine, to begin afresh the history of Israel as the green tree, the living vine; as when risen He would recommence the history of man, the last Adam.<a name=84:11></a> He returns, called out of Egypt, Son of God, but has to take His place where one truly an Israelite in whom was no guile could not believe anything good was to be found.<a name=84:12></a> He dwells at Nazareth.<a name=84:13></a> All this is most significant, but is only preliminary as a preface which indicates the subject-matter treated in the book of His life which follows.<a name=84:14></a>

		In chapter 3 we begin His history with the preparatory testimony of John the Baptist, who goes before the face of Jehovah.<a name=85:1></a> Such is the clear and precise declaration of Malachi 3: 1, or, if we take the quotation of Matthew himself, it is the voice of him who prepares the way of Jehovah.<a name=85:2></a> Such is Christ.<a name=85:3></a> Jehovah in the midst of men and in particular of the Jews, such, in a striking way, is the Christ of Matthew; but the Son of God also has taken the form of a servant as we are going to see.<a name=85:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The testimony of John did not accept the fact that one was son of Abraham as to the flesh.<a name=85:5></a> God could raise up sons to Abraham by His mighty power.<a name=85:6></a> The judgment or the kingdom was in view.<a name=85:7></a> Repentance must be in order to bear good fruit; and for sinful man the very first of those fruits was repentance.<a name=85:8></a> His baptism, in a word, was the beginning of repentance at the approach of the kingdom and as a preparation for entering in.<a name=85:9></a> The people not repenting could not enter in as a lump.<a name=85:10></a> But if he, John, baptized for repentance, One was there who was about to execute judgment by purifying His floor, but He baptized with the Holy Ghost.<a name=85:11></a> These three characteristics belonged to this testimony: -- particular and separative judgment (verse 10), <i>already</i> the axe was at the root of the trees; He who baptized with the Holy Ghost was there; He would purge His floor by a definitive judgment which would gather the good grain and burn the chaff with unquenchable fire.<a name=85:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Jesus presents Himself for baptism.<a name=85:13></a> It is His floor which is going to be purged; the granary is His; it is He who burns the chaff in the judgment.<a name=85:14></a> But He comes to place Himself in the midst of His people.<a name=85:15></a> Nothing more striking than this juxtaposition; nothing more positive than the declaration that He is Jehovah; nothing clearer than the fact that He places Himself in the midst of His people in the path where grace conducts them.<a name=85:16></a> Assuredly He does not join Himself with the rebellious and intractable people, but from the first step taken by those who by grace listen to the word of the testimony of God, from the first step in the good way, He is found with them in His infinite grace.<a name=85:17></a> The heart answers at once to the testimony of John that He who came had no need of repentance: we know it.<a name=85:18></a> Quite the contrary, He was fulfilling righteousness.<a name=85:19></a> But for His own it was just the thing according to God.<a name=85:20></a> The life of God, which put forth its first breath in the atmosphere of God but in the midst of men, took its first step in the divine way -- the way toward the kingdom which was going to appear.<a name=85:21></a> He would not leave them there alone.<a name=85:22></a> He takes His place with them.<a name=85:23></a> Infinite grace, sweet thought, full of His love for the heart of His own!<a name=85:24></a>

		Remark also how He abases Himself here to the level of His messenger: "thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness.<a name=86:1></a>" You have your part, I mine, in accomplishing the will of God.<a name=86:2></a> There He is already a servant!<a name=86:3></a> He is baptized, and His place taken in the midst of His own, in the midst of the faithful remnant that walked under the effect of the power of God's word.<a name=86:4></a> And now where is He, the Servant, He who humbled Himself, who has His place with His poor people, the poorest of His flock?<a name=86:5></a> Heaven is open, the Holy Spirit descends on Him, the Father owns Him as His Son.<a name=86:6></a> He is the model of the position He has taken for us by redemption.<a name=86:7></a> Never had heaven so opened before; never had there been on earth an object which He could own as making His good pleasure.<a name=86:8></a> Now there was.<a name=86:9></a> For us too the veil is rent, and heaven is open.<a name=86:10></a> We have been anointed and sealed of the Holy Spirit as Jesus was; the Father has owned us to be His beloved sons already in this world.<a name=86:11></a> Jesus was such in His own proper and full right, worthy of being so in Himself; we are introduced by grace and redemption.<a name=86:12></a> But entered into the midst of His people He shews what is the position which in Him belongs to them; as I have just said, He is its model.<a name=86:13></a> What happiness!<a name=86:14></a> what grace!<a name=86:15></a> But, carefully remark, His divine person remains always such, a difference besides which is never lost, whatever be His abasement and His grace toward us.<a name=86:16></a> When heaven is open for Jesus, He has no object above to which He looks to fix His attention.<a name=86:17></a> He is Himself the object that heaven contemplates.<a name=86:18></a> When heaven is open for Stephen, as for us by faith, Jesus the Son of man is the object in heaven which is open for His servant.<a name=86:19></a> In grace the Lord takes a place with us; He never loses His own either for the Father or for the heart of the believer.<a name=86:20></a> The nearer we are to Him, the more we adore Him.<a name=86:21></a>

		Remark here also another thing altogether notable.<a name=87:1></a> It is in and by the voluntary humiliation of Jesus that all the Trinity is for the first time fully revealed.<a name=87:2></a> The Son is there, the object specially conspicuous as man; the Holy Spirit comes and abides on Him; and the voice of the Father owns Him: marvellous revelation associated with the position that the Son had taken!<a name=87:3></a> The Son is recognised as Jehovah in Psalm 2.<a name=87:4></a> The Holy Spirit is found everywhere in the Old Testament.<a name=87:5></a> But the full revelation of the three persons in the oneness of God -- the basis of Christianity -- is reserved for the moment when the Son of God takes His place in the midst of the poor of His flock, His true place in the race in which He had His delights, the sons of men.<a name=87:6></a> What grace is that of Christianity!<a name=87:7></a> what a place is that where our hearts are found.<a name=87:8></a> If taught of God we have learned to know this grace and Him in whom it is come to us!<a name=87:9></a> Here then is our position according to this grace in Christ Jesus, before God our Father, accepted in the Beloved.<a name=87:10></a>

		Nevertheless, if such is our relation with God, we are in conflict here below with the enemy of our souls.<a name=87:11></a> Well, here too Jesus must go into it for us.<a name=87:12></a> This follows immediately.<a name=87:13></a> Jesus is led by the Holy Spirit to be tempted by the devil.<a name=87:14></a> If He takes or rather makes our place with God, He must take it in face of the enemy to bind the strong man that held us captive.<a name=87:15></a> I know not, dear brother, if this grace strikes you as is strikes me: but it seems to me to go beyond all the bearing of our thoughts, as much as the effort to reproduce it in human words for drawing the attention of souls to it only betrays the weakness which speaks of it.<a name=87:16></a> However let us pursue our essay, since it can be studied in the word itself, once the attention is thus drawn to it.<a name=87:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Jesus takes our place in conflict: solemn moment where all depended on His victory!<a name=87:18></a> It was not possible doubtless that He should not bear off the victory; but <i>if</i> the second Man had fallen like the first, all was ended and lost.<a name=87:19></a> Yes, that could not be; but He must conquer for us and conquer as man.<a name=87:20></a> It is exactly out of this position that the enemy wished to withdraw Him, out of the position of a servant, of man as such.<a name=87:21></a> "If thou art the Son of God" (and the Father had just owned Him thus) -- if thou art Son of God, speak that these stones may become loaves.<a name=87:22></a> Act as Son.<a name=87:23></a> There is no harm in eating when one is hungry.<a name=87:24></a> You have only to say this word and have the wherewithal to satisfy your wishes.<a name=87:25></a> That is, do your will; leave the position of servant you have taken.<a name=87:26></a> Not for a moment!<a name=87:27></a> He, being in the form of God, had taken the form of a servant; and He abides servant of His God.<a name=87:28></a>

		And, in these days of slighting the word, it is good for the heart to remark how He answers.<a name=88:1></a> A single text of the word, of the scripture, suffices for the fidelity and the almightiness of the Lord, for the wisdom of the Son of God; a single text suffices to reduce to silence the devil who wished to lead Him astray.<a name=88:2></a> The Son of God remains in His position of man, the servant; and the word of God directs, is the opening of, His ways.<a name=88:3></a> "It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word which proceedeth out of the mouth of God.<a name=88:4></a>" What a beautiful and perfect example!<a name=88:5></a> Not a movement of His heart toward any other thing than the authority of His God, of whom He had made Himself servant.<a name=88:6></a> The word of God issues from the mouth of God -- the words issued from His mouth, blessed be His name, direct to man.<a name=88:7></a> Christ maintains Himself in the place of man.<a name=88:8></a> Man shall not live by bread alone.<a name=88:9></a> The word is the source of His conduct; He lives by it.<a name=88:10></a> It is His directory doubtless; but it is also what puts His will in movement: without it He does nothing.<a name=88:11></a> He is come to do the will of God.<a name=88:12></a> The words which proceed out of His mouth declare this will and put in movement the soul of man the servant.<a name=88:13></a> Such is the obedience of Christ.<a name=88:14></a> The devil can do nothing there; he is silent.<a name=88:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Remember here, though they be only accessory circumstances, that this conflict did not occur in the garden of Eden, not in the midst of enjoyments which testified the goodness of God.<a name=88:16></a> Christ had already passed forty days, a solemn period of exercise and <i>endurance</i>, as we know by Moses and Elijah, and in an analogous manner by the forty years of Israel in the wilderness.<a name=88:17></a> He had been withdrawn from the ordinary state of humanity, not to prepare Him for the presence of God, as Moses and Elijah had been.<a name=88:18></a> He was in the wilderness, far from the pleasant things which, by the goodness of God, remain to man in this fallen world, for a struggle (not that we know that this was with special temptations, but for a struggle), with the enemy.<a name=88:19></a> His position was such as that of the world in its moral reality as God sees it, a desert where Satan rules (Mark 1: 13).<a name=88:20></a> Put to the proof thus by love for us and, while accomplishing the counsels of God, submitting fully in the ways of God (for He was led by the Holy Spirit into the wilderness) to the sufferings which come by the power of Satan into this world, He enters into the special conflict that He had to carry on with Satan, where we have to follow Him, but fighting against an enemy already beaten.<a name=88:21></a> He is not weary of His service of fidelity, He remains man the servant in obedience, He owns the absolute authority of the word, resting thereon as the basis of all His conduct.<a name=88:22></a> It is simplicity which is absolute perfection.<a name=88:23></a> Satan is vanquished.<a name=88:24></a> I repeat, a single text of the word -- whatever be the foolish pretensions of man -- suffices for the Lord, suffices for Satan.<a name=88:25></a> May this word suffice for us!<a name=88:26></a> Only may God give us grace to make use of it under the guidance of the Spirit of God whose sword it is, in order that it may be effectual in our hands.<a name=88:27></a>

		But to dare obey God in this world there must be confidence in God.<a name=89:1></a> This is the second trial the Lord undergoes for us.<a name=89:2></a> "If thou art Son of God, cast thyself down.<a name=89:3></a>" Try if God will be faithful to His promise (Psalm 91).<a name=89:4></a> This too was just out of the path of obedience.<a name=89:5></a> In this path He could always count upon God; but to put God to the proof to see if He would be faithful is not to confide in Him as assuredly such.<a name=89:6></a> This is what is meant by the expression "tempting God," and not, to go too far in confiding in Him (Exodus 17: 7).<a name=89:7></a> The confidence is perfect like the obedience.<a name=89:8></a> He waits on Jehovah.<a name=89:9></a> Sure that He will be faithful, that He is so always, He has but to follow the path of obedience and to depend on Him.<a name=89:10></a> His word will direct His steps and His thoughts, and will be accomplished in His promises.<a name=89:11></a> Such are the two elements of the life of the new man, of the life of Christ in us -- obedience, and dependence.<a name=89:12></a> Christ was perfect in both, in an obedience which had the word, the will, of God, as the source of His activity, not simply as its rule.<a name=89:13></a> When Satan presents the word falsely as a snare, the word suffices as a perfect answer to conduct the steps and the thoughts of man.<a name=89:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Remark further in these instructive answers of the Lord that, when it is a question of the wiles of the devil, the wisdom of the Lord confines itself to a striking simplicity, and in this that there is no need to think save of one's own duty.<a name=89:15></a> This is enough, and Satan can do no more.<a name=89:16></a> Man must live not by bread only, but by every word which proceeds out of the mouth of God.<a name=89:17></a> There is all; but it is all.<a name=89:18></a> His conduct is perfectly traced.<a name=89:19></a> It is submission, the path marked by the words of God.<a name=89:20></a> He does not enter into controversy with the enemy.<a name=89:21></a> He is found in this later with men.<a name=89:22></a> Here it is the perfect path of obedient man, His walk with Him.<a name=89:23></a> The word of God traces for Himself this path; and the end is completely attained.<a name=89:24></a> Satan is vanquished.<a name=89:25></a>

		The Lord, man here below, had been owned by the Father as His beloved Son, heaven being open on Him, and Himself anointed by the Holy Spirit.<a name=90:11></a> He had thus presented in Himself the place which according to God's counsels those should hold whom He is not ashamed to call His brethren.<a name=90:12></a> He had for them entered on the conflict that the strong man wages with them and, having conquered him for them, had shewn them how, by His grace, they could conquer in their turn.<a name=90:13></a> He must exercise His ministry in the midst of the people, and, whilst announcing the gospel of the kingdom, spoil the goods of the strong man that He had bound.<a name=90:14></a>

		It is important to remark here that it is not a question only of the salvation of such or such an individual (while the things may be bound together, and in fact are so, as John 3 proves), but of the establishment of a system of authority by which the heavens impress their character in blessing on the earth.<a name=91:6></a> The rejection of Christ has introduced better things, and relations more intimate and more entirely heavenly; but the kingdom will be established with a still fuller development when the Lord returns.<a name=91:7></a> This however is not the place to pursue this theme: let us follow our Gospel.<a name=91:8></a>

		The Lord then, seeing that His teaching had attracted the crowd, gathers His disciples and proclaims the great essential principles which were to serve as moral foundations for His kingdom, and to characterise those who were to have part in it.<a name=92:1></a> The first sixteen verses of chapter 5 contain the enunciation of these principles, as well as the character and position of the true sons of the kingdom.<a name=92:2></a> What follows to the end of chapter 7 consists of warning against the wanderings of the heart of man, and puts the ancient sayings and precepts which had currency among the Jews in contrast with the morality required by the kingdom of the heavens.<a name=92:3></a> It was a question of having the heart pure and clear from hatred, and the spirit submissive in such a way that impatience should not rise up, and that its evil should not come to light in the heart itself; it was a question of the patience and the gentleness which is more bent on keeping the heavenly character than one's own goods -- of the goodness ready to give and resembling the character of God Himself their Father who loves without being loved.<a name=92:4></a>

		Next, in chapter 6, the Lord would have the motives pure, and prayer in reference to the true relations at that time of His own with God and to the desires flowing from them.<a name=92:5></a> He would have the aim of the heart heavenly, and that it should have confidence in God for this low world; then again (chapter 7) that one should not judge when it was a question of motives, but that one should not misunderstand when the insolent contempt of God and of morality manifested itself; that dependence and confidence should be diligently expressed in presenting our requests to God, which He would hear as our loving Father: lastly, that practical obedience should lay a solid basis for the hope of the future.<a name=92:6></a>

		Having presented the great principles of the kingdom of the heavens, the Lord comes down from the mountain, and then begins the presentation to Israel of Jehovah come in grace in the midst of the people, Emmanuel, God with them, and of all the features of goodness, compassion, love, revealed in His ways towards them up to His rejection: a picture of every beauty and of the most profound interest!<a name=94:1></a> These features we will endeavour as much as we can to reproduce, while feeling how much the pen, alas!<a name=94:2></a> the heart also even though involuntarily, fails in it.<a name=94:3></a> But before entering this divine garden to enjoy the flowers and the fruits that grow there, it will be well to say a word on the kingdom and on the sermon, which we have just summed up briefly in reference to the kingdom.<a name=94:4></a>

		This kingdom, as a whole, is in view in its heavenly part and its earthly part in verses 5 and 12; and that which they were to pray for, we have seen, is the kingdom of the Father.<a name=94:5></a> But the disciples are all in the midst of difficulties and of persecutions, the salt in the midst of corruption, the light in a world of darkness.<a name=94:6></a> The law and the prophets were to be accomplished; but another thing is now introduced.<a name=94:7></a> Such was to be the kingdom of the heavens.<a name=94:8></a> The King was there in an adverse world, and in the midst of a people which was going to reject Him.<a name=94:9></a> But the kingdom of the heavens could not take place.<a name=94:10></a> For this the King was to go up to heaven; for the kingdom of the heavens is the kingdom of God, while the King and the government are in heaven.<a name=94:11></a>

		In what precedes we have a sketch of the Lord's ministry and of the principles of His kingdom.<a name=94:12></a> It is a complete whole.<a name=94:13></a> In what follows we see Him as He is presented personally to the people with the result of this presentation.<a name=94:14></a> He is rejected by Israel, and Israel is replaced for the moment by the church and the kingdom, though owned anew in grace when the kingdom shall be restored.<a name=94:15></a> For the moment it is the personal presentation of the Lord to the people with the consequences of this presentation.<a name=94:16></a> As He descended from the mountain with the crowd,<a href="#94:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> a leper came to meet Him.<a name=94:17></a> Now Jehovah alone healed leprosy.<a name=94:18></a> The man had learned that Jesus possessed the necessary power, but was not assured of His goodwill.<a name=94:19></a> If Thou wilt, said he, Thou canst cure it.<a name=94:20></a> But love and power were found there: Jehovah was there in grace to heal.<a name=94:21></a> I will, said Jesus, be thou clean.<a name=94:22></a> To whom did it pertain to say thus, I will, be thou?<a name=94:23></a> To One only: and the thing was done.<a name=94:24></a> But He who said so was also there to draw near the man, as Himself man.<a name=94:25></a> He lays His hand on the man, He touches the leper.<a name=94:26></a> Beautiful picture of that which was really there!<a name=94:27></a> God capable of doing everything, love and goodwill to do it, but man in the midst of a contaminated race which He has touched in His grace without being driven back by the evil, without being contaminated by the defilement though He touched it to heal it; and the man was healed, for Jehovah was there, man in the midst of His people.<a name=94:28></a>

		Such was the great fact by which this part of the Gospel begins.<a name=95:1></a> It is the essential fact of everything -- Emmanuel.<a name=95:2></a> Another element accompanies it.<a name=95:3></a> He owns the authority of the system in the midst of which He found Himself.<a name=95:4></a> The healed leper must go and shew himself to the priest; who, while pronouncing him clean and accepting his sacrifice, was owning in fact the divine power of Him who had thus healed the leper.<a name=95:5></a> The Man who is truly of humanity though without defilement, and whom the evil He came into contact with could not defile, was Emmanuel, Jehovah who healed, but entering by the door and subject to all that Jehovah had ordained in Israel.<a name=95:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The second fact is a fact parallel to this one.<a name=95:7></a> A man from among the Gentiles, with a faith which was not cramped by the proud egotism which confined all of it to the promises made to the people and to the privileges which belonged to them, but saw the divine power (if it was there) more in its own vastness, beseeches Jesus to heal his servant.<a name=95:8></a> The faith which places a man in the presence of God, which realises His presence, is always humble.<a name=95:9></a> The Gentile does not deem himself worthy that Jesus should come under his roof.<a name=95:10></a> He has only to say a word: everything would obey Him, as his soldiers himself.<a name=95:11></a> Jesus owns his faith; and the word is said: his servant is healed.<a name=95:12></a> But see another great truth which comes out here: the faith of the Gentile is owned, and the children of the kingdom according to the flesh shall be cast out.<a name=95:13></a> Where God is found, He cannot limit Himself to a particular people, whilst coming into the midst of them according to His promise; and, what is more, He cannot deny Himself nor change His character.<a name=95:14></a> If those who were of His people answered not to His character, they could not be with Him; and now He was revealing Himself and was the necessary centre of all that which could be owned.<a name=95:15></a>

		Afterwards He is present in that power of goodness which puts aside all the effects of sin and of Satan's dominion in this world.<a name=96:1></a> At one word from Jesus diseases cease, and demons flee away, and those possessed are delivered.<a name=96:2></a> It is not only power, but goodness.<a name=96:3></a> It is God who is there, but at the same time the Man who has a perfect sympathy with men carries their miseries on His heart and burdens Himself with the sorrows of their infirmities.<a name=96:4></a> He heals while feeling them; as we hear Him groan deeply at the tomb of Lazarus, though He raises Himself from among the dead.<a name=96:5></a>

		But it is none the less true that He is the despised and rejected of men: the Son of man has not where to lay His head -- has not the privileges of the foxes and of the birds in this world.<a name=96:6></a> He is not of this world; and to follow Him is to break entirely with everything which is of it.<a name=96:7></a> God come into this world is come because the world is without Him, and ought to have absolute right to the heart; and this to separate it from the world and from the flesh which has arranged itself without Him, and to attach the heart wholly to Him who was come to seek it.<a name=96:8></a> And the most powerful motives for the human heart were null before the rights of God come in grace because man was lost.<a name=96:9></a> It is not that God does not own the relations that He Himself has formed; but that when they make good their rights against Him who formed them, these rights are lost entirely, being derived from His will: to resist Him while asserting them is therefore to destroy them.<a name=96:10></a> Besides, if the Lord is there, His rights rise above everything.<a name=96:11></a>

		Now He is seen afresh in the midst of His service in Israel.<a name=98:8></a> Faith brings a man paralysed in his body.<a name=98:9></a> The Lord is still here as Emmanuel, yet man in their midst, but there He is announced with the promised blessing of Jehovah's presence in grace.<a name=98:10></a> Here it is no question of redemption (though certainly without it there could not be such a pardon), but of the application of pardon in grace in Israel as we see in Psalm 103; and for present blessing Israel must be pardoned.<a name=98:11></a> The Lord comes with this blessing, and it is a direct testimony to pardon: else He would have simply healed the paralytic as in other cases.<a name=98:12></a> But when Jehovah came in grace, He pardoned all their sins and healed all their iniquities.<a name=98:13></a> The Lord announces the presence of Jehovah to do the first of these things.<a name=98:14></a> The scribes murmured in themselves.<a name=98:15></a> Who but Jehovah could pardon?<a name=98:16></a> But He who knew their thoughts was there and proves by the other portion of the verse that the Lord was there in the power of His grace.<a name=98:17></a> He heals immediately the infirmity of the sick man.<a name=98:18></a>

		In the fourth case the word is understood: it penetrates, grows, and produces fruit in different degrees in different persons.<a name=111:1></a> In the first case it is said that the word was not understood, in this case it is said that it was; in the other cases the point is not touched.<a name=111:2></a> In the first case it was seen that nothing had penetrated.<a name=111:3></a> In the two following there was the appearance of it, but there was nothing: the plant perished without fruit.<a name=111:4></a> In the last case the seed is developed in the interior of the heart, and fruit is produced: precious effect according to the nature of what was sown, fruit for Him who had sown the seed and for him who had received it!<a name=111:5></a> There is no judgment, but the patent facts stated by the Lord in contrast with the vineyard and His fig-tree where He was seeking fruit, and in contrast also with the kingdom or state of things in the world, and their result in the judgment at the end.<a name=111:6></a>

		The first of the following parables shews the effect of the sowing in the world up to the end of the age, but does not take in the execution of judgment: this is found, as well as the manifestation of glory, in the explanation made to the disciples in the house.<a name=111:7></a> It should be remarked that, in the parable of the sower, He is not named.<a name=111:8></a> It is the effect of the word in the heart of man, whoever may have sown.<a name=111:9></a> Here, on the contrary, we have a similitude of the kingdom, and He who sows takes the character (not of Christ -- we have seen His work closed in His rejection, the Messiah seeking fruit was come to be received in Israel, but) of Son of man.<a name=111:10></a> He who sows is the Son of man, and the field is the world; but I anticipate.<a name=111:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have always the general character of the work that the Lord wrought: He sowed; but not the personal result in the world.<a name=111:12></a> He has sown good seed in His field, but the responsibility of man is in question in the result produced; and whilst they slept, the enemy came and sowed tares.<a name=111:13></a> That did not hinder the good grain from being in the garner, but spoilt the whole of the crop in the field, and the evil which had been done was without remedy.<a name=111:14></a> It is forbidden the servants to root up the tares for fear of rooting up the good grain with them, precisely what happened when men would do so: the two were to grow together till the harvest.<a name=111:15></a> The kingdom of the heavens presented in this world a spoilt crop, fruit, on one side of the Lord's work, on the other of the enemy's work.<a name=111:16></a> Now in the parable we have only what happens in the kingdom before the manifestation of the King and the execution of judgment by Him.<a name=111:17></a> When He shall be manifested and the public judgment come, there will be no more parables, the mystery of God will be closed.<a name=111:18></a> In the parables we have mysteries, that which demands a revelation to know them; the execution of judgment is in itself the most striking revelation.<a name=111:19></a> In the parable we have then at the end in general <i>the time</i> of the harvest; and the tares are gathered first in bundles to burn them.<a name=111:20></a> The tares are there in bundles on the field of this world, and the good grain is hid in the garner.<a name=111:21></a>

		Afterwards, before explaining the parable of the tares, the Lord gives two other similitudes of the kingdom; and remember that it is a question here of the kingdom.<a name=112:1></a> It is well to remark that the word for likeness is not the same in these parables and that of the tares.<a name=112:2></a> Here it is only the character the kingdom will take; it is "like" to, etc.<a name=112:3></a> In the parable of the tares, "it is become," or has been made, "like.<a name=112:4></a>" It is a character that it has taken in actual circumstances considering the rejection of the King.<a name=112:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is worth while also to remark in these parables those in which the thing in itself is the subject of comparison, and those where it is the individual or those who form the essential part of the parable.<a name=112:6></a> The kingdom itself is like a little grain of mustard seed becoming a great tree, symbol in the Old Testament of a thing elevated in the world, of a political power.<a name=112:7></a> We know well that this is come -- that the birds nesting in its branches signifies the protection it affords.<a name=112:8></a> Compare Daniel 4: 12.<a name=112:9></a> It is the public appearance of the kingdom system such as it has been for ages: here is no judgment.<a name=112:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next comes the parable of the leaven.<a name=112:11></a> The likeness is the leaven.<a name=112:12></a> The woman is not a sower; it is not the Lord who sows what is designated as the good seed; it is not a great tree in the world.<a name=112:13></a> It is a doctrine which insinuates itself everywhere in certain limits, and forms the entire lump according to its own nature.<a name=112:14></a> The whole is leavened: it is Christendom.<a name=112:15></a> But in neither of these two parables do we arrive at judgment.<a name=112:16></a> It is the kingdom such as it is when the grain of mustard seed or the leaven has fully acted and produced its effect.<a name=112:17></a> It is true that leaven is always employed in an evil sense; yet I do not think this is the aim of the parable, but the doctrine which forms all in one sole lump where it penetrates.<a name=112:18></a> If it was purely the evil as evil, we should have had some exception.<a name=112:19></a> This is marked in the tares, but on another side.<a name=112:20></a> It is not the good that is sown, nor the Lord who sows; so that the notion of positive good is carefully avoided as well as of him who does so.<a name=112:21></a> The point is not the word of God, but the fact of the general profession of Christians and in a form where no idea of good is presented; for certainly leaven is not, in the word, an image of good.<a name=112:22></a> No more is the parable the description of an individual.<a name=112:23></a> There is hardly need to discuss this point, because it is a similitude of the kingdom of the heavens, and in no case is an individual the kingdom of the heavens.<a name=112:24></a> Besides, the result in an individual is not that which is depicted here.<a name=112:25></a>

		These then are the three descriptions of the kingdom on the earth during the absence of the king, such as the kingdom is presented to the eyes of all: a mixture of good and bad, the harvest thus spoilt as a whole; afterwards a great human and political power on the earth; and a general profession of doctrine without question of the individual state of anyone whatever.<a name=113:1></a> Afterwards the good corn is hid in the garner; and providence prepares the seed of the enemy to be burnt by binding them together in bundles on earth.<a name=113:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the Lord enters the house; and there, speaking to the disciples alone, He enters more into the inner principles of the kingdom of which He speaks, communicating not the effect in the world, but the thoughts of God, the great result which would explain all in judgment and glory manifested on earth, and the real aim of what the Lord had done as well as the action of those who enter with intelligence into His ways.<a name=113:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First He explains the parable of the tares.<a name=113:4></a> We have already spoken of the chief features, but the Lord adds here what concerns the manifestation of the result in this world.<a name=113:5></a> In the parable we have left the wheat in the garner and the tares in bundles on the field, the wicked gathered by the angels or by the providence of God.<a name=113:6></a> But here appears on the scene the Son of man to remove every scandal from His kingdom (which He does), and He casts the wicked into a furnace of fire where is weeping and gnashing of teeth.<a name=113:7></a> It is the judgment executed.<a name=113:8></a> The servants were to let the tares grow.<a name=113:9></a> Then after the judgment the righteous shine in the kingdom like the sun -- in effect like Jesus Himself.<a name=113:10></a> This is the result and this the divine explanation of what was a mystery before, for the judgment manifests what faith discerns.<a name=113:11></a> Remark that all which is revealed is in the world, first the kingdom before, then the judgment after.<a name=113:12></a> The fact is stated that the corn is hidden; but nothing is said of the garner nor of the state of the corn when it is there.<a name=113:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the parables which follow we have, as it has been said, the thoughts of God, the aim of the Lord in the kingdom, but still those thoughts, without speaking of a result in judgment, as we have seen in that of the mustard seed and that of the leaven.<a name=114:1></a> The first shews us the kingdom as the discovery of a treasure formerly unknown, hidden in a field; and he who had found it renounces all that he has to have it, and for this buys the field.<a name=114:2></a> This is what Christ did.<a name=114:3></a> All that He had as Messiah on earth He left to have the treasure of His people by taking the field where they were found, the world, to have them.<a name=114:4></a> They were hidden in this world; but Christ knew about them, taught of the Father as Man on the earth, and surrendered all up to His life to have us.<a name=114:5></a> If in fact we renounce all to have Christ, nevertheless it is no question (as people too much forget) of an individual, but of the kingdom; and, further, we buy no field to have Him.<a name=114:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second case is a little different.<a name=114:7></a> The point is not a discovery.<a name=114:8></a> The merchant was in search of good pearls.<a name=114:9></a> He knew what a good pearl was, he could appreciate them, he wanted good ones.<a name=114:10></a> Now Christ has found in the church the object of His search, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing.<a name=114:11></a> I do not think of the church as a body or system, but of its moral beauty.<a name=114:12></a> The merchant had taste for beauty in pearls, Christ for what was beautiful in the eyes of God, and, to have it, He left His Messianic glory and His life.<a name=114:13></a> What happiness to think that He satisfies His heart in us, and what perfection of beauty in God's eyes is the thing wrought out!<a name=114:14></a> Zion is called the perfection of beauty, but there it was earthly; here it is heavenly according to the heart of God.<a name=114:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The last parable demands the most serious attention.<a name=114:16></a> For my part I do not doubt that it applies particularly to these days.<a name=114:17></a> The net of the gospel is cast into the sea of people and gathers fish of every sort.<a name=114:18></a> The effect of the gospel is not that all the fish enter into its meshes, but that a quantity of all sorts, good and bad, are gathered within the net.<a name=114:19></a> This is the result.<a name=114:20></a> Then those who drew the net sit down there, on the shore, and engage in what they have at heart, in the aim for which they have drawn the net -- to get good fish; and they choose, separate them from the bad, and put them apart in vessels, rejecting the bad and leaving them there.<a name=114:21></a> It is the fishermen who do that, and occupy themselves with the good.<a name=114:22></a> That is to say, when Christianity has gathered, as it has done, a certain mass of people who are placed altogether in the net of Christendom, at the end of the days the servants of Christ occupy themselves with the mass and gather the good into vessels.<a name=114:23></a> They are the servants of Christ who have intelligence and can distinguish them, knowing what they want.<a name=114:24></a> When the public government shall arrive, there will be the inverse.<a name=114:25></a> The angels, ministers of the providence and the government of God, take not the good but the wicked on the earth and cast them into the fire.<a name=114:26></a> The principle, I believe, applies always when the gospel in a district has gathered many persons: the aim of the Lord is to put His own together in companies apart.<a name=114:27></a> But the parable seems to speak directly of the result of the operation of the gospel in gathering many persons as having part in the christian name; then, as a second operation, on the shore they sort them and engage in putting the good apart.<a name=114:28></a> The execution of judgment is another thing.<a name=114:29></a> In this parable as in the two preceding, we find spiritual discernment with respect to the aim of God.<a name=114:30></a> In the second this characterises the action of the merchant; in the first and the third the field is bought, the net filled, but in the two cases the treasure and the good fish are distinguished from what is taken outwardly and govern the action both of the merchant and of the fishermen.<a name=114:31></a>

		It is to be remarked that four of these similitudes do not speak of judgment, but of the outward appearance or of the aim of God in the kingdom, and of the result whether in the world or with God.<a name=115:1></a> The great tree and the leaven -- such is the result in the world; the treasure and the pearl -- such is what is acquired for God.<a name=115:2></a> In the first and the last we have the judgment; but the difference is sensible.<a name=115:3></a> In the first, naturally, we see the Lord begin the work; and He has done so, of course, without mixture of evil, the good corn being all good.<a name=115:4></a> The enemy makes a distinct work -- cannot do otherwise.<a name=115:5></a> There is a harvest; but the word has produced individual plants: the mixture is found in the harvest.<a name=115:6></a> But there are two works distinct, and the two things remain such till the end, and the preparation for judgment is the action of God in the world, and He is occupied first with the wicked to prepare them for the judgment.<a name=115:7></a> Men do not act; they are forbidden to act.<a name=115:8></a> What is produced is the effect of the action of the Lord and of the enemy.<a name=115:9></a> The servants slept: that is all.<a name=115:10></a> Wheat and tares were always wheat and tares, fruit of a distinct work.<a name=115:11></a>

		In the net the mixture was the result of the work of man, the kind of fish distinct, doubtless, but all gathered into the net by a single toil, and that on the part of men, the fishermen.<a name=116:1></a> This is not here a work of the enemy, but the imperfect work of man.<a name=116:2></a> It is only the fact however which is stated.<a name=116:3></a> The net is full, then drawn on shore; and those who have the intelligence of what is a good fish, those whose aim (and it is that of God) is to have good fish, sort them and put the good into vessels.<a name=116:4></a> The explanation, as previously, is the judgment which shows publicly what was true and understood spiritually before.<a name=116:5></a> But the angels occupy themselves only with the bad.<a name=116:6></a> In the first parable it is a question of rooting out of the world the bad, which was not allowed to the servants.<a name=116:7></a> In the last it is a question of putting the good together into vessels, which was their intelligent work.<a name=116:8></a> We must not forget that the last times were already come in the days of the apostle.<a name=116:9></a>

		The immediate connections then existing of the Lord with the Jews were, as we have seen, terminated, and the kingdom of heaven was proclaimed according to the form which it was to take in consequence of His rejection.<a name=116:10></a> He was no longer seeking fruit from His vine, but was sowing that He might have fruit through the word.<a name=116:11></a> But Jesus continued to think of the people, shewing what He was, and alas!<a name=116:12></a> what they themselves were, and what was to take the place of His connections with the Jews, such as they would have been, if He had been received by them.<a name=116:13></a>

		Chapters 14 and 16 shew us what He was then for the Jews, and what the remnant would become through His absence from that people, and the rejection or setting aside of the people.<a name=116:14></a> Chapter 15 brings in what He was for them as a divine person, even when the people were wicked and rejected; but being so, because He was God, and His counsels could not change.<a name=116:15></a> This favour extended itself to the Gentiles who had no right to the promises, although He did not abandon His positive connections with Israel; for the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.<a name=116:16></a> But we must remember that in this unfolding of the ways of God the grace of the Lord, divine and personal grace, is manifested in the most touching and instructive manner, and practical lessons for us are brought out continually from what is passing.<a name=116:17></a>

		In the next chapter the great controversy with the people, a controversy at bottom with the heart of man, is continued, but on moral ground; always in the midst of Israel, but full of instruction for all ages.<a name=119:27></a> It is ordinance in contrast with the morality willed by God, which is immutable in this sense that it refers to the relations in which man is found placed whether with God or with man, which consists in the maintenance in walk of that which suits those relations.<a name=119:28></a> Once God has found these relations, whether of the creature with Himself or of His creatures among themselves, the duties exist of themselves, being only the practical expression of the relation, as a true worship rendered to God, or piety and filial obedience with every other consequence of those relations.<a name=119:29></a> Now the corrupted heart of man loves its own will and the satisfaction of its lusts too much to fulfil its duties; and forms of piety which feed its self-love please it more than duties and leave it free to follow its lusts.<a name=119:30></a> Neither God nor His character is truly known.<a name=119:31></a> God is not honoured by the heart, and the heart is not purified.<a name=119:32></a> To wash his hands suits such a man better than a pure heart or approaching God really.<a name=119:33></a>

		The Lord touches distinctly this moral plague, shewing at the same time that the worship of these hypocrites was as far as possible from being accepted of God; that the commandments of men could not but put God aside and exalt man to the detriment of the divine glory.<a name=120:1></a> The commandments of God were nullified.<a name=120:2></a> His worship encroached on by the false authority of man, and in vain offered by the same persons who were dragged along in the current (for the heart of man is easily subdued by such pretensions to piety), and man replaced God in what acted on the heart.<a name=120:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord takes care to protest openly against the very principles which led to this hypocrisy while addressing the crowd that He called to Him.<a name=120:4></a> There is nothing the Lord detests more than human religion, the traditions of men.<a name=120:5></a> Nothing shuts out God more while abusing His name and thus subjecting consciences which do not know Him truly.<a name=120:6></a> Nothing however is more simple; what issues from the heart is what defiles the man.<a name=120:7></a> But we see how the heart of man is influenced by these things, and how the simple by this means fall under the influence of hypocrites and of every class of religious teachers.<a name=120:8></a> The Pharisees were scandalised at it, said the disciples.<a name=120:9></a> And no wonder.<a name=120:10></a> To have a conscience before God according to His word, and in the light of God for itself, spoilt all their business.<a name=120:11></a> But through love for us, through the necessity of what is true and good, this is what must be.<a name=120:12></a> Then, at the point at which we have arrived in the history of the Saviour, it was no longer a question of minding these false doctors -- these were not plants that the heavenly Father of our Lord had planted.<a name=120:13></a> They were to be rooted up.<a name=120:14></a> It was needful to leave them -- a solemn thought with regard to the people and still more for Christianity!<a name=120:15></a> These were blind leaders of the blind; both were falling into the ditch.<a name=120:16></a>

		As to the disciples, the Lord's answer goes much farther, while at the same time it makes evident the apostle's want of intelligence; in effect, the principle is evident.<a name=121:1></a> But what a picture of the heart of man followed, thanks be to God, by that of the heart of God and of His ways in grace!<a name=121:2></a> That which went out of the heart defiled the man.<a name=121:3></a> All is simple.<a name=121:4></a> But what is it that went out from it?<a name=121:5></a> Evil thoughts, murders, then a terrible list of those dark productions of a depraved and corrupt heart.<a name=121:6></a> But cannot the Lord relieve a little this gloomy picture by touches of light which are found in these hearts!<a name=121:7></a> He finds none.<a name=121:8></a> Thus characterised, He leaves the heart of man.<a name=121:9></a> He was not wanting in goodness, He knew the heart -- knew everything about man; but beyond that list He is silent.<a name=121:10></a> It is not saying that there are not amiable features in the natural heart (that may be so even in animals), but morally this is what comes out of the heart, the fruits of the root of the sin which is there, restrained, kept in, modified, yet the fruit that man's heart produces wherever he is permitted to follow his inclinations.<a name=121:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus the Lord passes from the hypocritical customs used by man to cover what he is and to give himself a religious character (even though the truths which he professes may be divine, and the system in its origin emanating from God) -- passes, from traditions of men and the vain worship of human ordinances, to the heart which it seeks to cover, and lays it bare.<a name=121:12></a> We learn what is in the heart, as God sees it in those who are not among the plants planted by the Father.<a name=121:13></a> And their religion which concealed it -- what was it?<a name=121:14></a> Hypocrisy, and God set aside by human ordinances.<a name=121:15></a> Thus we see, in a people that God had brought near to Himself and in a religion that He had Himself established, God set aside in order to bring in man, his own traditions and his commandments, with hands washed in the place of his heart; and then, what the natural heart is in its fruits before God.<a name=121:16></a>

		Now the Lord passes in the most striking manner to what is outside all the promises, to a race that was accursed according to the promises made to the people of God, to the place that the Lord quotes as an example of hardness of heart (chapter 11), and shews, whilst at the same time recognising the dispensations of God towards His people, and His faithfulness in sending them the Messiah, what a heart comes to that is driven by its need and by the faith with goes right to the heart of God, and what that divine heart is for the wants that faith brings to Him, what He is in Himself outside dispensational rules.<a name=122:1></a> The Lord goes towards Tyre and Sidon.<a name=122:2></a> A Canaanitish woman comes towards Him.<a name=122:3></a> Her daughter was tormented with a demon.<a name=122:4></a> She recognises the Lord, as the heir of the promises in Israel, as Son of David.<a name=122:5></a> This was truly faith as to His person; but what part had a Canaanitish woman with the promises made to Israel or with the blessings that were granted to them as the people of God?<a name=122:6></a> The Lord does not answer her.<a name=122:7></a> Deeper lessons were to be given of what man is, but also of what God is.<a name=122:8></a>

		The disciples would have wished the Lord to grant her what she asked, in order to get rid of her; but the Lord maintains His place as Son of David.<a name=122:9></a> He is sent to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.<a name=122:10></a> The need of the poor woman rises above her formal acknowledgment of Jesus as Son of David.<a name=122:11></a> "Lord, help me.<a name=122:12></a>" Her wants are simple.<a name=122:13></a> They are plainly declared.<a name=122:14></a> But the Lord wishes to put her thoroughly to the test.<a name=122:15></a> "It is not meet to take the children's bread and cast it unto dogs.<a name=122:16></a>" The Lord acknowledges the dispensations of God with respect to His people, however wicked they might be, and the woman does so also; but lessons far deeper are here taught.<a name=122:17></a> The poor woman -- man as shewn in her finds his place.<a name=122:18></a> He is under the curse, without promise, having right to nothing, or under the power of the demon.<a name=122:19></a> He must own his condition, and this is what the woman does.<a name=122:20></a> She is a dog, but in need.<a name=122:21></a> Her hope is not in any right that she possesses, but in the free goodness of God.<a name=122:22></a> It is a need which comes face to face with God come in grace.<a name=122:23></a> She fully recognises what she is, a dog; but she maintains that, if it be so, there is sufficient goodness in God for such beings.<a name=122:24></a> Could God say, No, there is not?<a name=122:25></a> Could Christ represent Himself thus?<a name=122:26></a> Impossible.<a name=122:27></a> By faith want is met across all the obstacles of Jewish rites and of personal unworthiness, thoroughly owning them, but placing itself outside every right in immediate contact with the goodness of God.<a name=122:28></a>

		CHAPTERS 14, 15
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have been occupied with these chapters; for they occupy evidently a special place between the mysteries of the kingdom on the judicial rejection of the Jews at the end of chapter 12 (which goes on to the end of the age) and the church and kingdom glory in chapters 16, 17.<a name=123:8></a> The contexts are naturally special; for the kingdom is set forth after the ruin of Judaism in chapter 13, and the church, and the glory of the kingdom come after.<a name=123:9></a> What is this special place?<a name=123:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is plain that chapter 13 gives the kingdom of heaven in the peculiar character it assumes when the King is in heaven, not manifested, and, as Mark says, it grows and springs up he seemingly knows not how.<a name=123:11></a> What then is brought out between this and the revelation of the church on earth?<a name=123:12></a> It is the actual proof of present rejection and the incapacity of the disciples to avail themselves of His then present power; the moral darkness of the scribes and Pharisees, the intrinsic falseness of their religious principles; but the disciples really got no farther.<a name=123:13></a> The Pharisees were not plants of God's planting at all; the disciples were, blind on many things as they were.<a name=123:14></a> The Lord is here getting on strong moral ground -- what God has planted, and the human heart being the source of evil.<a name=123:15></a> God, not Judaism or tradition, was the spring and guide of good; man's heart is only evil.<a name=123:16></a>

		But Christ, still in His own place, takes only His service in Israel; but He goes where one of the accursed races and of wicked Tyre has access to Him, owning Him as Son of David.<a name=124:1></a> As such He could not help <i>her</i>.<a name=124:2></a> But this brings out what must go beyond these limits -- the goodness of God.<a name=124:3></a> This, to faith, He could not deny.<a name=124:4></a> Thus, while man's heart even in the Jew was only evil, God was -- could not but be -- good to faith.<a name=124:5></a> But He had not given up Israel, though all this was true; and the hungry multitude of Galilee are again fed, though the disciples are not now called to do it; He takes the loaves and does it Himself.<a name=124:6></a> The baskets that contained the fragments are not now the number which is the sign of perfect government in man, but of special or divine perfection -- seven, not twelve.<a name=124:7></a> It is grace above promise, and not simply divine power able to fulfil it.<a name=124:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This leads me to say a few words more in detail of chapter 14.<a name=124:9></a> The work of rejection begins; John is beheaded, and Jesus retires, but only to find a multitude whom He meets in grace.<a name=124:10></a> He then shews Himself as the Jehovah that was to satisfy the poor with bread, let Him be rejected by the nations as He may.<a name=124:11></a> He expects the disciples to understand and use this power; but they do not -- they judge by sight.<a name=124:12></a> "Give ye them to eat.<a name=124:13></a>" "We have here but five loaves and two fishes!<a name=124:14></a>" Then He sends the disciples away while He is on high, and joins them still in the ship, connected, I apprehend, with Judaism which He had left to cross the world by divine power -- our part.<a name=124:15></a> But Peter cannot -- only but for being helped he was sinking and (like the Jewish remnant) re-enters the ship, but with Christ.<a name=124:16></a> The walking on water was in principle church position, walking simply by faith to meet Jesus, with no known hold, only by faith.<a name=124:17></a> When He rejoins the ship, they own Him, not as Messiah in a carnal way and expectation as even the disciples had done, but as Son of God, which was just what the nation would not do, and the disciples <i>practically</i> never did, though God taught individuals so.<a name=124:18></a> The country of Gennesaret which once rejected Him now receives Him with open arms.<a name=124:19></a> It is a divine Person then here, when not only Israel but the disciples could not own, or at any rate profit by, His manifestation to Israel.<a name=124:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have then, as noted above, the moral judgment of Israel's state and of their teachers; but again the disciples are without understanding.<a name=124:21></a> Yet in this very chapter, where essential divine principles of truth and grace are brought so clearly out, there is a special recognition of Israel.<a name=124:22></a> The Canaanitish woman not only called Him Son of David, but owned Israel as the children and herself as only a dog.<a name=124:23></a> The Lord takes this ground, though necessarily owning God to be good to others.<a name=124:24></a> And the people glorify the God of Israel.<a name=124:25></a>

		On the whole, we have Israel rejecting the witness of God; Christ present as Immanuel, but the disciples unable to profit by it, left and rejoined; moral principles, of man's heart, and God's overflowing goodness; but plants must be of God's planting or rooted up; Israel rejected but owned.<a name=125:1></a> Still the Lord distinguished the disciples as possessed of personal faith (save of course Judas) -- plants of the Lord's planting; and when He now simply leaves the Pharisees, He appeals to that faith; chapter 16.<a name=125:2></a> Ignorant as they were of God's ways and incapable of availing themselves of what Christ was, yet the inquiry addressed to their personal faith brings out the answer (given of the Father) of that on which the church should be built.<a name=125:3></a> They cling to <i>Him</i> -- to His person when the nation rejected Him, and when even they could not profit rightly by His presence in Israel.<a name=125:4></a> But then, when Israel was for the time rejected, that person became the foundation of everything, and the Lord (who had put the question to draw out this distinctive faith, however prejudiced and buried in traditions even they were) at once recognises the direct teaching of the Father.<a name=125:5></a> Now Israel was gone, on this the church would be built.<a name=125:6></a> The contrast of verses 1-5, then 6-12, and what then follows, is very striking.<a name=125:7></a> Read in verse 18, "And I also say unto thee," in contrast with or addition to the Father's revelation, and also to Peter's confessing.<a name=125:8></a> He had said, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.<a name=125:9></a>" Christ says, "Thou art Peter"; but this was the authority, the really divine or divinely given title to give a name.<a name=125:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The rest of the verse is a kind of parenthesis.<a name=125:11></a> By the revelation of what Christ was by the Father, he partook of the nature of the foundation, as all true believers do, though not distinguished as Peter.<a name=125:12></a> But the building of the assembly comes out as Christ's new revelation consequent on the setting aside of all preceding leading up to the Father's revelation of His Son (to Simon), triumphant by His divine Person and nature over death, whence Satan's power could not prevail against it, though Israel's (even the disciples') hopes were ended by His death.<a name=125:13></a> But the Son of the living God would on this title build a church over which hades' gate could have no power to prevail.<a name=125:14></a> Not Peter, but Christ builds the church; but Peter does administer the kingdom.<a name=125:15></a> Nothing is said to him as to having anything to do with the church -- save a name, which shews his confession, put him into connection with it.<a name=125:16></a> For if the church was built on that truth, and he had confessed it as taught of God, he was in principle (though the church was not yet revealed or begun) on the footing of it as to his acknowledgment of Christ.<a name=125:17></a> Hence they are charged not to say He is "the Christ.<a name=125:18></a>" The Father has revealed Him in another way.<a name=125:19></a> The kingdom of heaven Peter was to administer.<a name=125:20></a> Every scribe instructed into the kingdom of heaven brings out of his treasure things new and old.<a name=125:21></a>

		The presenting of God's grace in the Person of the Lord, in the Gospel of Matthew, brings before us in a very striking way, how the blessed Lord took our place, and was a pattern of ours in the relationship into which He has brought us by redemption, whether of blessing or conflict, only overcoming for us.<a name=127:1></a> Many, many passages shew His grace in it, but in this He takes the place itself.<a name=127:2></a> I refer to the end of Matthew 3 and beginning of Matthew 4.<a name=127:3></a> The law and the prophets were till John.<a name=127:4></a> Then the kingdom of heaven, as presently coming in, was announced.<a name=127:5></a> There was repentance for the people, but a new thing to be set up.<a name=127:6></a> The first step in good was receiving the testimony and coming to that repentance; and their hearts, touched by grace, go.<a name=127:7></a>

		But the blessed and gracious Lord has fully entered into our case, the place of His people, and He now takes that in which they are in conflict with Satan, as well as that in which they are in relationship with God.<a name=129:15></a> Thus anointed as man, He was led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.<a name=129:16></a> Many things here suggest themselves to the mind: the difference of the position of Adam and Eve, when they were tempted; the difference of the character of the forty days during which Moses and Elias were estranged, so to speak, from the common lot of humanity; but I confine myself here to the great fact of the temptation, and the Lord's undergoing it, as the other side of our position from our relationship in Him with God.<a name=129:17></a> Only remark that the temptation follows this.<a name=129:18></a> That is fully established, and it is as anointed therein of the Holy Ghost that He enters into it.<a name=129:19></a> The tempter comes to Him.<a name=129:20></a> The point of His temptation was to lead Him out of the place He had taken as man, and first out of that of obedience, or of a servant, His perfect place as man.<a name=129:21></a> If Thou be the Son of God, use your authority, speak so that these stones become bread.<a name=129:22></a> In a word, do an act of your own will, since you are nothing less than Son of God.<a name=129:23></a> But the blessed Lord holds fast to the simple place of obedience, of the servant, of man, but perfect Man.<a name=129:24></a>

		But several things are to be noted here.<a name=130:1></a> First, He has no need to go farther than His own duty, no long controversy or reasoning with Satan.<a name=130:2></a> The latter comes with wile; but deceit has no place in simple duty, and the Lord, as a servant, occupies Himself with that, and it is enough.<a name=130:3></a> Next, God's will is His motive for acting, not merely His rule.<a name=130:4></a> That of course it was, but His motive also: an important principle.<a name=130:5></a> It is not selfwill arrested by a rule even cheerfully submitted to.<a name=130:6></a> The obedience of Christ has the will of God for the source of His actions.<a name=130:7></a> Thirdly, the word of God, the scriptures, are the adequate, complete, and sufficient expression of this for man.<a name=130:8></a> He quotes a text and that is all.<a name=130:9></a> But that is all God's will expressed for man.<a name=130:10></a> Man lives by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.<a name=130:11></a>

		Wondrous expression!<a name=130:12></a> It is divine, absolutely so in its source and character, out of <i>God's mouth</i>, but perfectly adapted for man to live by.<a name=130:13></a> There is nothing like that; only Christ is the living expression of it -- the Word made flesh.<a name=130:14></a> Man may talk very high about it, as the foolish slave of the enemy, deceived by him; but a single text is enough for Him who is the Wisdom of God, the Lord, and enough for Satan, so that <i>he</i> has no reply.<a name=130:15></a> It gave Christ His place as man, and with that Satan could do nothing.<a name=130:16></a> He betrayed himself and his weakness if he suggested anything contrary to it.<a name=130:17></a> Scripture is enough for the Lord Himself, for man here below, and for the devil.<a name=130:18></a> It comes from the mouth of God and man lives by it.<a name=130:19></a> Christ guarantees this to us.<a name=130:20></a>

		The way in which the Lord met the enemy is exceedingly instructive; but that to which I desired especially to draw the attention of your readers was the blessed way in which the Lord took our place, put Himself in it, a model and a pattern of ours for its simple but highest privileges, and in the combat which belongs to it, in which we are, and there, in the lowliness and perfectness of a servant's place, has shewn us to our path too.<a name=131:20></a> But in both He really was, and the combat now over as to the relationship and blessing, He is only in glory, but as man, and has brought us into it by redemption and grace.<a name=131:21></a> I know no more blessed picture of our connection with the Lord, the man of God's counsels, and that because we see Him in it alone in His own perfectness.<a name=131:22></a>

		In what follows the temptation, we have the sum of all the Lord's ministry; not His discussions at Jerusalem, which have another character and are chiefly in John, in the midst of a condemned people, but amongst the poor of the flock, spoiling the goods of him whom He had overcome.<a name=132:1></a> The rejection of John was His rejection, the close of John's ministry the beginning of His own, and leaving Judaea He seeks the poor of the flock, where prophecy had already declared that the light should spring up.<a name=132:2></a> He was carrying on the testimony begun by prophets, and more immediately before by John the baptist, himself a testimony not to what was, but what was to come.<a name=132:3></a> His person, Jehovah in grace, in their midst, was the great testimony: but His ministry followed in the train of those who had gone before, only announcing the near approach of the kingdom and calling to repentance, because the kingdom of heaven was at hand.<a name=132:4></a> It is the same testimony as that of John Baptist, not owning the title of the people to have the kingdom as the people of iniquity (compare Isaiah 48: 2; 57: 21), but calling to repentance, separating morally those who had ears to hear, and on the ground that the kingdom of heaven was close at hand.<a name=132:5></a> But there is necessarily this difference between John the baptist and the Lord, that, though they may have surrounded him as a teacher, John pointed to another, while the Lord -- and great grace it was -- gathered round Himself: proof that a divine Person was there: such alone had title to do it.<a name=132:6></a> They leave all and follow Him.<a name=132:7></a> He is a commanding and binding power of attraction.<a name=132:8></a> The whole of His general ministry is summed up in verse 23.<a name=132:9></a> This single verse embraces characteristically His whole ministry.<a name=132:10></a> The two following state the effect: His fame spread through the country, so that sick were brought to Him, and He was followed by multitudes from all parts.<a name=132:11></a>

		The history of His ministry is here complete, multitudes surrounding Him, which gave occasion to His taking His disciples apart to a mountain (though it appears the multitude followed so as to hear what He said), and teach them what were the real principles of the kingdom which was going to be set up.<a name=132:12></a> Such is the sermon on the Mount.<a name=132:13></a> The first sixteen verses give the whole positive statement of the character and position of those who belong to it in truth, or rather to whom it belongs.<a name=132:14></a> It is taken, remark, in its whole extent.<a name=132:15></a> First, the general character of those to whom it belongs, the poor in spirit, not the haughty of this world, but those who mourn in the midst of evil.<a name=132:16></a> It is a characteristic of grace when evil is in the place of righteousness.<a name=132:17></a> Peace-making characterises God.<a name=132:18></a> It is striking how peace is associated with God and His work.<a name=132:19></a> He is the God of peace.<a name=132:20></a> Peace on the earth is announced with Christ: He has made peace.<a name=132:21></a> "Peace be with you" was His twice repeated word.<a name=132:22></a> The fruits of righteousness are sown in peace.<a name=132:23></a> Pure in heart comes no doubt first, as elsewhere: first pure, then peaceable.<a name=132:24></a> Pure in Himself, He is at peace, and so makes it in grace.<a name=132:25></a> When we are pure in heart, the Spirit of peace seeks it in others.<a name=132:26></a>

		In the fourth verse we see that the promises of the kingdom rise to its highest privileges.<a name=133:1></a> The moral character looked for in those who were to have part in the kingdom having been stated, rising to its highest privileges and activity in grace, the consequences in a world of evil, till it was set up in power, are then pointed out; persecutions for righteousness and persecutions for Christ's name.<a name=133:2></a> The former shewed the kingdom of heaven theirs, the latter pointed to reward in heaven itself.<a name=133:3></a> Thus, while verse 5 assures the meek of the earthly portion, this points to the possessions of the reward in heaven itself.<a name=133:4></a> Their position in the world is then stated, the salt of the earth and the light of the world -- what is in contrast with and so far hinders the corruption of that in which it is, and the testimony of God's light to those in darkness in the world around.<a name=133:5></a>

		We can hardly have a more wondrous picture or presentation of His coming to the earth, Jehovah-Man, touching man in grace, power, and love, good-will to heal in grace, and present there with man.<a name=135:1></a> Grace is there -- a word heals -- the work of Jehovah, but Man touching, laying His hand on man.<a name=135:2></a> At the same time the Lord, while giving this proof of His divine presence, recognises the Jewish economy as still subsisting.<a name=135:3></a> The cleansed leper was to go to the priest and offer his offering for a testimony.<a name=135:4></a> In accepting it, they owned he was healed, they owned that Jehovah was there -- Jehovah there in grace, but still owning Israel as to its standing.<a name=135:5></a> But this divine grace manifested in Israel, being divine, could not limit itself to Israel.<a name=135:6></a> A Gentile -- owning far more fully, as not shut up in Jewish thoughts, the divine power that was in exercise, that the Lord could dispose of all things, as he sent his soldiers hither and thither -- looks for mercy for his servant, but, with a faith which, as ever when it realises the divine presence, produced true lowliness of heart, counts himself unworthy that Jesus should come under his roof.<a name=135:7></a> A word from the Lord, ready as He was to go to him, sufficed, and the word was spoken.<a name=135:8></a> Such faith had not been found in Israel.<a name=135:9></a> It is for the Lord the occasion to declare that many from all parts, Gentiles, shall come and enjoy the promises with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and the children of the kingdom, its natural heirs, Israel, would be cast out into outer darkness.<a name=135:10></a> Faith and the person of the Lord take the place of natural succession, because God is revealed, and, as He must be if He is, in grace; and once revealed must have what suits Himself, and acts in a grace which is above ordinances.<a name=135:11></a> It was now because the person of the blessed One was there, As thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee.<a name=135:12></a> Yet He was still subject, coming in by the door, we have seen, to the law in Israel, yet in power, and grace could not be limited to it.<a name=135:13></a> Jehovah healing in Israel, a man amongst them, but one who must reach to the Gentiles, going forth in grace towards them.<a name=135:14></a>

		We may remark that in this, as in the last chapter, He takes the title of Son of man, His title of predilection in love to us, wider than Christ, which though He was, He did not come to take, and never takes in Israel.<a name=138:1></a> He is there as Emmanuel Jehovah, to save His people; but as Son of man, a title of all-importance; the One who takes the kingdom in glory from heaven; yea has all things under His feet.<a name=138:2></a> Christ never presents Himself as Christ.<a name=138:3></a> The Son of man was to be strong for God (Psalm 80: 17); but now He was to suffer.<a name=138:4></a> But God, though in the midst of His people, must, when down here, take, in His nature and work, His place in connection with men beyond all relationship in law, the rejected One on earth.<a name=138:5></a> The Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins; so the crowd says, "such power to men.<a name=138:6></a>" Forgiveness then was there; and grace to sinners.<a name=138:7></a> He was there in that character.<a name=138:8></a> He goes and eats with publicans, having called Matthew who was one.<a name=138:9></a> It was not the outside which governed His path.<a name=138:10></a> God was there and the work was to be the effect of His presence and grace, not dependent on what He found.<a name=138:11></a> And He knew the heart, and the vessels to choose to be under the effect of that grace as instruments of it.<a name=138:12></a> But the principle of the work was the principle of grace; He came not to find, but to bring what was needed, and the vessels to receive it for service were vessels chosen, divinely known, and wrought by grace into new and fitting instruments.<a name=138:13></a> He is there then forgiving sins, and eating with sinners, but it is Jehovah who heals; Psalm 103.<a name=138:14></a>

		I have remarked that Matthew gives an order in his recital which is the mind of the Spirit as to the bearing of the facts (that is, after the birth and before the last scene at Jerusalem).<a name=140:3></a> The whole history, as such, between these epochs we have seen given in one verse at the end of chapter 4.<a name=140:4></a> We have here first the whole number of apostles chosen, as we see in Luke, after prayer, before the sermon on the Mount.<a name=140:5></a> One finds at the outset of their commission how the testimony as a present service is, in this Gospel, confined to Israel as enjoying Emmanuel's presence, though it could not end there, closing at the same time by Israel's rejection of that Emmanuel.<a name=140:6></a> God's presence on earth could but be only for Jews, if He was the minister of the circumcision for the truth of God.<a name=140:7></a> The twelve are forbidden to go elsewhere.<a name=140:8></a> The way of the Gentiles they were not to tread, and no city of the Samaritans was to receive their visit.<a name=140:9></a> The lost sheep of the house of Israel were to be the objects of their care.<a name=140:10></a> They were to preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.<a name=140:11></a> All evil was to be subject to them -- death itself, the power of the enemy, and the sorrows and human ills brought in by sin -- leprosy and all.<a name=140:12></a> And as they received gratuitously -- Jehovah's power to use in their hands in grace -- they were to use it in the same grace; and they were to trust His power and care equally and take no provision for the way.<a name=140:13></a> It was Jehovah who sent.<a name=140:14></a> They did His service, and the labourer was worthy of his hire.<a name=140:15></a> Jehovah's care was there, and they, as we read afterwards in Luke, lack nothing.<a name=140:16></a> Further, they were to seek out the godly remnant, inquire who was worthy in the city, and abide there, and the sons of peace were to receive a blessing.<a name=140:17></a> Those that refused this all but last testimony, and here treated as practically the last (there was only partially the seventy on His way to Jerusalem afterwards), were judged and rejected as worse than Sodom and Gomorrha.<a name=140:18></a> This verse closes the direct present commission.<a name=140:19></a> What follows from verse 16 continues indeed their service on the same mission, that is, exclusively to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, but goes on beyond the Lord's rejection and on to His coming again (verse 22).<a name=140:20></a>

		The full character of their mission as thus left to serve is gone into -- persecution, death -- but the Spirit of their Father speaking in them, and a care over them which counted the hairs of their head.<a name=141:1></a> But this part of the chapter shews how deeply the Lord felt His rejection in Israel, noticed as we have seen all through.<a name=141:2></a> The full power needed would be given no doubt every moment, but the testimony would draw out the passions of men in a way that would break through every natural tie.<a name=141:3></a> Relations of nature divinely formed would not resist the hatred of the human heart against the testimony of God, and they would be hated of all men for Christ's name sake; strange feeling, which only the hatred of man's heart against God can explain!<a name=141:4></a> They would be brought before kings and governors, for so the Lord would bring this testimony before the great and before the Gentiles: the hatred of the Jews would do it, a plain testimony that we are here still in Israel.<a name=141:5></a> But the hatred would be universal: they were to endure to the end.<a name=141:6></a> They were to go, when persecuted in one city, to another; nor would have gone through the cities of Israel till the Son of man came.<a name=141:7></a> It was Christ's portion.<a name=141:8></a> They had called the Master of the house Beelzebub: He looked at it fully; they must face it, if they were in the place of testimony; enough for them to be as He.<a name=141:9></a> But they were not to fear, all would come out and they were to be out in open daylight in service; death might be there on the road, they were not to fear but Him, who could judge and deal with body and soul both.<a name=141:10></a> But it is remarkable how the Lord, as to Himself and them, takes the power of evil for granted, though God was with full care of His own above all; yet till judgment came as to the present manifestations of power, evil reigned (compare Revelation 2: 10); for He, the power of God, was about to be rejected, and all this power of evil pressed upon His spirit in sending them out.<a name=141:11></a> Now indeed as Emmanuel present He guarded them, but in this second part the presence of the Spirit marks Him gone, and already treated as Beelzebub.<a name=141:12></a> Such warning is not found (though the fire was already kindled) in the first fifteen verses: but He knew His portion, and warned them of theirs.<a name=141:13></a> But they were of value to God, and not to fear.<a name=141:14></a> He is to be confessed before men at all cost.<a name=141:15></a> But nature and the flesh, which, as to power, He could have restored, were over in His rejection.<a name=141:16></a> What man broke through in hatred to God they must give up in devotedness to Christ.<a name=141:17></a>

		The closing of the old creation is not here doctrinally taught, but the deep feelings of the Lord, as to the practical effect of the coming in of what was divine into the scene of man proved apostate by its effect, are wonderfully portrayed.<a name=142:1></a> It is not only the warning to the disciples (verse 21, 22), when the enmity is spoken of, but the general effect of His coming (verse 34-36).<a name=142:2></a> Peace on earth was not the word now, but enmity in the closest relations.<a name=142:3></a> Owning the Lord is intolerable to man.<a name=142:4></a> The closer the relationship, the greater the hostility.<a name=142:5></a> But Christ came a test of everything, and as His presence and the true confession of Him awakened hostility, so the heart of His servant must take Him, the new divine thing, instead of everything.<a name=142:6></a> The world had proved the incompatibility of the old and the new, nature as it was and grace, and the servant and minister of grace must give up all (verse 37).<a name=142:7></a> Christ tests the heart as well as the world.<a name=142:8></a> He was the rejected One.<a name=142:9></a> His servant must take up the cross and follow Him.<a name=142:10></a> Natural life was of course the track of nature, and that must be given up too in nature to find it new with God.<a name=142:11></a> But then they were thus associated with Christ, and he that received them received Him.<a name=142:12></a> The recognition of the testimony come into the world was the reception of Him of whom it spake, and the reception of Him was the reception of Him who sent Him, and whose Witness in the world He was.<a name=142:13></a> This was the turning-point, the owning Him, His name and word, if a cup of cold water only was given.<a name=142:14></a> The difference of verses 1-15, though the principle of testimony was the same, with verses 16 to the end is very marked; the power of the then final testimony with judgment on him that did not receive it, while He was there present as Emmanuel.<a name=142:15></a> and the moral mark in the world of a rejected Saviour.<a name=142:16></a> His grace continued in patience, but the fact that He was called Beelzebub had borne its witness in His soul.<a name=142:17></a> The present was a final testimony in Israel; the rest, the witness of a rejected Saviour; but all in Israel, save as it brought them as guilty before Gentiles.<a name=142:18></a>

		But now we come to what was inside all this, the glory of His person known to none, and the revelation made by Him of that name of grace which, in the rejection of the Son and Servant, was brought out for the soul of him that was weary in a Christ-rejecting world.<a name=144:12></a> The unbelief, justly rebuked by the Lord, found with it no gall nor bitterness in the spirit of the blessed Lord, so that He should not be pure with His Father, it only threw Him from man into the fulness of the mind of God; but first in lowliness and submission in the place of the servant, ascribing all to His Father, yet as Son, perfect submission, but entire confidence of love, thus intelligence clear, no delay in solving the mystery, seeing it on the side of God.<a name=144:13></a> At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father.<a name=144:14></a> Then He is owned as supreme in everything, Lord of heaven and earth, and with the owning of this supremacy, the sense of the fitness of the dealing; human wisdom failed, it was fitting, necessary; how should it, base and earthly, understand divine ways?<a name=144:15></a> They were hidden, and hidden by the Lord of all from the wise and prudent.<a name=144:16></a> He puts man's wisdom in its place, its true moral place.<a name=144:17></a> But grace revealed them to the simple and unpretending, the unsuspecting confidingness of the babe.<a name=144:18></a> So it seemed good in the Father's sight; man, and old things with him, had passed away; Christ, the second Man, the Son in grace, replaced them all.<a name=144:19></a>

		But there is another thing that then comes, but comes after this, though accompanying it: "Take My yoke upon you and learn of Me.<a name=146:1></a>" The first point was He had brought the grace and rest for him who came to Him by it, but He had shewn in His rejection the lowliness and meekness which bowed to the Father's will and accepted His rejection, looking absolutely to His Father's will and good pleasure, and thus thanking, even in the midst of sorrow, not looking at the evil to be vexed, but to His Father out of it working in His wise and holy ways.<a name=146:2></a> Meek and lowly of heart He gives rest to the soul; as to its state, perfect rest through the knowledge of grace, with God by coming to Christ, and rest of heart through lowliness and the absence of all working of will.<a name=146:3></a> His yoke is easy and His burden light, the one which He had borne.<a name=146:4></a>

		And now see how faith and God's character meet.<a name=156:22></a> I have thus spoken of the dispensational character of this history.<a name=156:23></a> Recognising Israel fully, the divine Person there necessarily over-passes its limits, but the moral character of the circumstances are of the deepest interest.<a name=156:24></a> Great faith produces great humility.<a name=156:25></a> There is the full recognition not only of entire unworthiness, accepting the place of a dog, but that there is no right, no claim, no promise, but then through grace, by reason of this, she goes right through to the goodness of God in Himself.<a name=156:26></a> That is true faith; she, as Christ, owned the dispensations of God, His right to have a people of His own, but saw Him revealed, Himself in Christ, and her need met the riches of the grace and love which were in Him.<a name=156:27></a> It is thus need by faith meets God, God Himself in goodness, but revealed in Christ, as part of the goodness was so to present Himself.<a name=156:28></a> We may learn afterwards to joy in God, when we know Him; but here we meet Him and as He is, as He puts Himself forth in Christ to be met.<a name=156:29></a> Hence Christ, to manifest this faith, puts forth the dispensational side in the strongest way, that faith, going on the ground of need, might pierce through all this up to God Himself, as the divine nature and goodness pierced through in Christ the place of service He had taken in Israel.<a name=156:30></a> And thus the simplicity of need meets the riches of God's goodness by means of grace in Christ on one side, and through grace, faith on the other.<a name=156:31></a> In this respect it is a beautiful scene.<a name=156:32></a> And this is, I think, progress.<a name=156:33></a>

		Some other important points arise out of this chapter.<a name=164:5></a> As regards this world, the coming of the Lord was a kind of provisional or tentative coming, though for far more important purposes.<a name=164:6></a> Just as He could say, till the Son of man comes, though He was there; and this double purpose is morally evident, because He came completing the trial and testing of man (compare John 15: 22-24), and also to accomplish His Father's will, and give His life a ransom for many.<a name=164:7></a> And it was His rejection in the first form which brought about the accomplishment of the second, so that responsibility and grace in atonement met in the cross.<a name=164:8></a> Thus, if they could receive it, John was Elias who was to come.<a name=164:9></a> The scribes were right in expecting him, but John was come in the spirit and power of Elias.<a name=164:10></a> To him they had done what they listed.<a name=164:11></a> Only if Elias came, personally he must be another; when the Son of man comes, it will be the same, only risen and glorified.<a name=164:12></a> The Lord allowed the difficulty to be presented that the whole scene that was going on might be brought out.<a name=164:13></a>

		We then come to the incapacity of the disciples to use by faith the power which was then present.<a name=164:14></a> The poor man with the demoniac son had brought him to the disciples, and they could not cast the demon out.<a name=164:15></a> This draws out from Jesus the expression of the uselessness of His stay with them, when even His disciples could not make use of His power.<a name=164:16></a> This it is which finally leads, not to the prophecy and declaration that He would suffer, and depart, and rise again, but to the immediate expression of what drove Him away.<a name=164:17></a> "O, faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you?<a name=164:18></a> how long shall I suffer you?<a name=164:19></a>" The unbelief even of His disciples, hindering the efficacious testimony to His power, led to His going away.<a name=164:20></a> His person remained the same, and His personal grace, but His work was hindered by the faithlessness even of His own.<a name=164:21></a> How long was He to stay and bear with them?<a name=164:22></a> Thus we learn what closes a dispensation and the Lord's dealings in goodness, not the power of evil that brought Him here, but the powerlessness of those who follow Him, in making good the testimony He has given of His power and goodness.<a name=164:23></a> This does not cease, but in the same sentence in which He say, How long?<a name=164:24></a> He says, Bring thy son hither.<a name=164:25></a> It is what we have seen, the closing of His service here, but His person and grace only shining out the more brightly; the same yesterday, today, and for ever; and exercised wherever there was a want that came to Him, the actual meeting-place between man and God -- a want, and grace in a Saviour.<a name=164:26></a>

		Two things are then brought out as regards the exercise of this power of God by faith.<a name=165:1></a> First faith, unclouded confidence in Christ to do it, but, secondly, that there was a real adverse power of Satan, and that, in cases where that power was in its full exercise, as here, it could not be met and overcome but by nearness to God, bringing in His power by prayer and that self-restraint in which the heart was separated from nature to God.<a name=165:2></a> I expect no miracles in these last days, save false ones on the part of the enemy, though many things are counted miracles which in connection with God's government faith ought always to do; but for that to which faith now applies, according to the will of God, these directions are of the last importance; faith in God's power, and that in exercise in grace towards us, and this sought in prayer and separation of heart to God.<a name=165:3></a> Elias, we read, was a man of like passions with us, and he prayed, which I notice, because all we read of in the Old Testament is his declaration, "As the Lord liveth," etc.<a name=165:4></a>; 1 Kings 17: 1.<a name=165:5></a> In spite of all this practical unbelief in the disciples, the personal glory and grace of the Lord, and the association of the disciples with Himself in grace, is no way hidden or diminished.<a name=165:6></a> The close of the chapter is a remarkable witness of this in connection with what we have been seeing.<a name=165:7></a>

		The true position at this moment too is clearly seen.<a name=166:1></a> In chapters 18 to 20 to the end of verse 28 are presented to us in a general way the principles in which they were to walk in the new order of things, and in general what characterised this new order in contrast with nature and Judaism, while God's creation is fully owned.<a name=166:2></a> The Lord begins with the abnegation of self, and self-importance.<a name=166:3></a> We are to be as little children; one who was not such in principle could not enter into it, and he who was most so would be greatest in it.<a name=166:4></a> The Christian received Christ in receiving such in Christ's name.<a name=166:5></a> But opposition and difficulties were to be expected.<a name=166:6></a> Woe to the world because of them!<a name=166:7></a> If they put a stumbling-block in the way of these little ones who did believe, for weakness might accompany simplicity, they had better have been hopelessly drowned in the sea.<a name=166:8></a> As to oneself, if one found anything in oneself that led one to stumble, no self-sparing; better lose the best member one has than one's soul.<a name=166:9></a> The Lord always maintains in the strongest way the solemnity of God's judgment of evil.<a name=166:10></a> The fullest freest grace is taught us, blessed be God, but nothing to weaken the horror of evil, but the contrary.<a name=166:11></a>

		There is comfort in what follows, if not professed doctrine, as to infants, and their salvation if going out of the world as such.<a name=166:12></a> The Lord's disciples were not to despise them: they were always present before Jesus' Father in heaven.<a name=166:13></a> I take "angel" in the common use of it in scripture, of one who represented another without his being personally there.<a name=166:14></a> Thus we have the Angel of the Lord; the Malak-Jehovah.<a name=166:15></a> They said of Peter, It is his angel.<a name=166:16></a> It may be an angel who does the service; but the object of the passage is not to shew who does it but what is done, and for this purpose popular language is used.<a name=166:17></a> But this blessing is not founded on sentimentality, or vague notions.<a name=166:18></a> It is founded on the parable used for sinners in general of the lost sheep, and that the Son of man was come to save what was lost; only here, with infants, it is not said to <i>seek</i>.<a name=166:19></a> But it is not the will of our Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish: of such is the kingdom of heaven.<a name=166:20></a> It is not, I judge, to be thought that the Lord speaks of the poor and humble in spirit; they are the greatest in the kingdom: it would be a small and insignificant thing to say of them that it was not the Father's will that they should perish.<a name=166:21></a>

		We have then the case of a brother offending another, not the world; and this introduces the assembly in practice here below in the coming period.<a name=167:1></a> The injured person was to tell his offending brother, and win him if he could; if not, take one or two more, and if that failed, it would not merely be, You say, and I say, but the whole matter before the whole assembly with clear evidence.<a name=167:2></a> If he refused the judgment of the assembly, he was to be as a heathen man and as a publican.<a name=167:3></a> The assembly takes in this the place of the synagogue.<a name=167:4></a> It is remarkable here that the successors to the power given to Peter to loose and to bind, so as to have heaven's sanction upon it, are the two or three gathered as an assembly.<a name=167:5></a> What the assembly decided, as such, was sanctioned in heaven.<a name=167:6></a> The Lord adds the promise of granting what was asked by two or three so assembled, for He Himself would be there.<a name=167:7></a> But what should characterise the disciple was grace, and, if personal forgiveness answered the end, it was to be given constantly.<a name=167:8></a> Church discipline is another thing, it comes to be judicial and needed for clearing conscience.<a name=167:9></a> The spirit of forgiveness belonged essentially to the Christian.<a name=167:10></a> By being forgiven he was one, and he was not partaker of it if he had not the spirit of it.<a name=167:11></a>

		The next, chapter 19, furnishes us, I think, with some very important principles.<a name=168:1></a> Nature, brought up, and as God formed it, was fully recognised, but a principle and power is brought in which is wholly above it, and in its actual moral state it is fully detected and judged; while the following of Christ out of nature's power has blessing in this world and in that to come.<a name=168:2></a> This -- setting every thing in its place on the rejection of Christ, which did reveal every thing, and brought in a new power -- is full, it seems to me, of the deepest instruction.<a name=168:3></a> It has its occasion first as a question debated in the Jewish school, to which the Lord gives the divine answer which unfolds the whole state of things: "Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?<a name=168:4></a>" The Lord goes back behind the law to God's original institution: "He which made them at the beginning .<a name=168:5></a>.<a name=168:6></a>.<a name=168:7></a> .<a name=168:8></a> From the beginning it was not so.<a name=168:9></a>" Thus God's natural order, the relationship He had formed, origin of all other human relationships is restored by Christ's authority.<a name=168:10></a> He returns to God and God's institution of man.<a name=168:11></a> It is not Jehovah, it is not "my Father," but God made them -- a very important principle.<a name=168:12></a> The law takes its place as a provisional thing by the bye.<a name=168:13></a> Looked at as a Jewish law, a law of ordinances, God had made allowance for the hardness of the human heart, and now returned to His own thoughts and institutions.<a name=168:14></a> God's order created order.<a name=168:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But besides this, another power is come in, which is not nature but divine, as in the power of the Spirit of God, because nature is all ruined, the power of evil is in the world, to which nature is no answer, because it is what is ruined; power therefore comes in, which is above nature, as being of God, but which consequently owns nature as He made it, and His institutions.<a name=168:16></a> To break them is sin, to live above them is the gift of God.<a name=168:17></a> "He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.<a name=168:18></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence also the Lord receives little children, and blesses them.<a name=168:19></a> This was in God's order, and of God's creation, in a certain sense unspoiled.<a name=168:20></a> I speak not of the root of sin, but of the manifestation of evil in the world.<a name=168:21></a> In themselves they were the fruit of God's natural order, as yet in a state unspoiled and natural.<a name=168:22></a> And so they are.<a name=168:23></a> The kingdom of heaven set up this order again in natural relationships and nature as God made it.<a name=168:24></a> We are not talking of the church here; that has its relationships spoken of in chapter 18.<a name=168:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But nature, however amiable and good in this sense, has the deep root of evil in it.<a name=168:26></a> This we see in the young man who runs up to the Lord.<a name=168:27></a> A beautiful character -- his shewing desire of learning of Him, whom he saw to be the most perfect master of good, would inherit eternal life, had kept all those commandments which were the maintenance of the relationships we have spoken of.<a name=168:28></a> But the Lord cuts down the whole seed of man (for the young man came to Him as a man, a Rabbi).<a name=168:29></a> There was none good but one -- God; still for man the commandments were His will, and, for man to enter into life he was to keep them in the system of the law.<a name=168:30></a> Relationship to God the Lord does not speak of, and He says <i>life</i>, dropping the word eternal, which the young man had used.<a name=168:31></a> But the way of life for man in this world was keeping the commandments.<a name=168:32></a> The young man, like Paul, was irreproachable in conduct.<a name=168:33></a> The Lord puts the test of lust and of his heart, and all was wrong.<a name=168:34></a> Instead of lust judged, and all counted dung for Christ, Christ is left for the riches which his lust clung to.<a name=168:35></a> This tale was told of man's heart; even where irreproachable, lust possessed it, and earth, not heaven, was its desire.<a name=168:36></a> The new and heavenly thing had come in which detected its state, and the fairest remains of creation: character and qualities were nothing; the heart was away from God.<a name=168:37></a> Riches -- which to a Jew were a sign of divine favour, according to the government of this earth, now that God was revealed, and man's state made manifest, that it was a question of man's heart with God -- were the greatest hindrance.<a name=168:38></a> The reason was simple: they held the desires of the natural heart.<a name=168:39></a>

		But if one with the best qualities, and the desire of doing good, and such an opportunity, were not saved, who was to be?<a name=169:1></a> The Lord's answer does not avoid the consequence; with man it was impossible: plain, earnest, and solemn testimony.<a name=169:2></a> But that did not hinder God; all was possible with Him, and He could save.<a name=169:3></a> We have, then, the consequence of giving up all for Christ, but not beyond the kingdom.<a name=169:4></a> All here concerns the kingdom.<a name=169:5></a> Peter, ever forward, puts the question, What were they to have who had forsaken all?<a name=169:6></a> In the renewed world, which was coming, they would be on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel, the first places in the centre of the kingdom; and every one who had left what nature loved for Christ's name would have a hundredfold in this world, and then everlasting life; for in following Christ eternal life comes in, not in doing the law.<a name=169:7></a>

		In chapter 20: 30 the Lord accepts the title of Son of David, acting in grace where the place of the curse had been.<a name=170:14></a> He is therefore now no longer with the poor of the flock in Galilee, but drawing nigh to Jerusalem, in the character in which He had to say to His people there as such; a last testimony to them before His rejection by them, and their judgment.<a name=170:15></a> Accordingly He enters into Jerusalem as King, according to the prophecy of Zechariah, only the first part of it is omitted, the accomplishment of which will be at another time.<a name=170:16></a> Then He will be just, and having salvation.<a name=170:17></a> He was it always; but it was not in that character that He rode into Jerusalem now.<a name=170:18></a> His whole character here is placing the Jews under the final test of the presence of Messiah their King, bringing on their judgment as about to leave them; the rejected King passes them all in review before Him, and assigns them their place.<a name=170:19></a> It is the last closing act between Messiah and Jerusalem.<a name=170:20></a> God put the testimony in the mouths of the multitude, which shall be the cry of Israel in the last days, according to Psalm 118.<a name=170:21></a> He acts as holy King and Judge, and clears the temple of its defilements.<a name=170:22></a>

		The chief priests and scribes came to Him, as He was teaching, to demand His authority for what He did.<a name=171:14></a> This is the common question of what is really apostate ecclesiastical authority.<a name=171:15></a> That which is of God owns God's work: God's work proves itself.<a name=171:16></a> If God's work is done, God has wrought it, and God's authority to act is not a matter of question for those who, being of God, know His work.<a name=171:17></a> Man may sometimes mix that which is of himself with it, and so far spoil and enfeeble the testimony.<a name=171:18></a> but that which is of God they who are of God will own.<a name=171:19></a> In Christ all was perfect, of course.<a name=171:20></a> Hence the Lord puts them on their capacity to judge of God's work, and from carnal motives they avow their incapacity to judge of it.<a name=171:21></a> Why then should He tell them by what authority He acted?<a name=171:22></a> They were confessedly unable to judge of it.<a name=171:23></a> It was a humbling setting aside of their pretensions -- avowed incapacity.<a name=171:24></a> But it is well to remember that God's work does not need authorisation.<a name=171:25></a> From whom is it to receive this?<a name=171:26></a> God assuredly needs none to work, or make others work, and he who pleads ecclesiastical authority for working proves that it is not God who is working, for who can authorise Him?<a name=171:27></a>

		It may seem more difficult till the proofs are there, but that is a matter of faith.<a name=172:1></a> If Christ has given the talent to trade with, the seeking another authority gives proof that he who does so does not know his Master.<a name=172:2></a> He does not know that he is sent of Christ, for then he need not seek another.<a name=172:3></a> If he has another without that, it is simply nought.<a name=172:4></a> But the Lord goes farther with their religious authorities, and in the parable of the two sons shews that the repentant sinner, not the pretended just one, was the doer of God's will.<a name=172:5></a> The publicans and harlots went into God's kingdom before such.<a name=172:6></a> Terrible and humbling sentence!<a name=172:7></a> but so it was.<a name=172:8></a> Nor had the bowing to John's testimony by these repentant sinners wrought on the conscience of these hardened self-righteous ones.<a name=172:9></a>

		The Lord then gives utterance to a parable which was the divine judgment on the whole conduct of the leaders of Israel, represented by those before Him.<a name=172:10></a> He had done everything for His vineyard, and then in due season He sought fruit -- sent the prophets, who were rejected, and persecuted, and killed -- sent yet more, and they treated them in the same way; at last He sent His Son, saying, They will reverence my Son.<a name=172:11></a> Him they cast out and slew.<a name=172:12></a> The chief priests and scribes pronounce the only possible judgment on them in reply to the Lord.<a name=172:13></a> It was their own sentence.<a name=172:14></a> The Lord then from scripture -- testimony which they could not deny -- shews that what they rejected was made by God the head of the corner.<a name=172:15></a> There could not be a plainer testimony, more immediately applicable.<a name=172:16></a> God, and the chiefs of Israel, the builders, were in open contradiction.<a name=172:17></a> It was Jehovah's doing to exalt the rejected stone.<a name=172:18></a> It is still Psalm 118, the special oracle of God as to these events.<a name=172:19></a> We have then the Lord's open comment and statement as to the result with the Jews -- the kingdom of God taken from them, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits of the kingdom.<a name=172:20></a> It was to Gentiles, but that is not the special point of the Lord's words.<a name=172:21></a> It was to a nation bringing forth the fruits of the kingdom.<a name=172:22></a> If that be not done, they cease to answer to the description, whatever the patience of God; and though that be not the subject here, they also would have to be cut off.<a name=172:23></a> The same truth is otherwise told in Romans 11.<a name=172:24></a>

		If Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob had ceased to exist, could God have still taken their names, the name of naught to characterise Himself to Israel?<a name=175:1></a> He might have said, I am He who was with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, when they existed; and even so it would have been an utterly unworthy relationship -- the God of those who had a mere animal existence.<a name=175:2></a> God characterises Himself by them -- is not ashamed to be called their God.<a name=175:3></a> Could He characterise Himself by a mere dying animal, who, when He calls Himself theirs, did not exist at all?<a name=175:4></a> He is not the God of the dead, but of the living.<a name=175:5></a> But this truth went farther, for, as to separation of soul and body, Abraham was dead, and, though living for God, was not what God meant him to be as his God.<a name=175:6></a> God was not even in this sense, as an abiding state, the God of the dead.<a name=175:7></a> They must be according to what He would have man, soul and body.<a name=175:8></a> Till all was accomplished they might wait with their spirits blessed, but this was not God's thought as to man.<a name=175:9></a> He was to be complete, and hence raised from the dead.<a name=175:10></a> The name of God indicating His relationship with those, gone for the moment, demonstrated the resurrection.<a name=175:11></a> For Him indeed, as we read, all are alive; but the ground of the argument here is God's relationship with them.<a name=175:12></a> He cannot be the God of those who do not exist.<a name=175:13></a> It was a living Abraham, body and soul, of whom God could be the God.<a name=175:14></a> Death therefore, for he was dead, proved the resurrection.<a name=175:15></a> Thus divine truth was established in contradiction to the Sadducees.<a name=175:16></a>

		Chapter 23 is a remarkable proof how in this Gospel, till we arrive at the very last chapter, all refers to the Jews, and even there it is not what actually took place among the Gentiles in our present Gospel.<a name=176:1></a> The scribes and Pharisees are still seen as sitting in Moses' seat with the book of God in their hand, and in the very chapter in which they are utterly denounced (for it is the object of this chapter) in every aspect, the disciples, moving still as Jewish disciples among the Jews, are to follow what they say from Moses' seat, and their testimony (verse 34) is sent to these same Jews.<a name=176:2></a> No one sits in that seat now.<a name=176:3></a> We may find some analogies, which the church found early when it was corrupting itself; but there is no seat of Moses to sit in.<a name=176:4></a> Father or Rabbi is alike out of place.<a name=176:5></a> How completely however the testimony is here viewed as among the Jews, is seen (verse 34) where the apostolic and christian ministry is formally so treated, sent to those whom the Lord was now denouncing.<a name=176:6></a> With this is formally designated at once their place and ministry.<a name=176:7></a> The object of the chapter is to denounce those who led the people to reject their own mercy in Christ.<a name=176:8></a>

		Then come out the various aspects of ecclesiastical Pharisaism.<a name=177:1></a> First is the shutting up the kingdom of heaven against men; not going in themselves, they seek to hinder others; they profit by their religious profession to get widows' money, making long prayers; very great zeal to make a proselyte to their superstition, making him then worse than themselves; blind themselves, they lead the blind, but into the ditch.<a name=177:2></a> With refined casuistry as to what is evil, they shew their folly to the spiritual mind; excessively exact and zealous about the minute externals of religion, the substantial realities of it they neglect.<a name=177:3></a> They strain out the gnat and swallow the camel; as the chief priests bought Christ's blood for money without a scruple, but would not put it into the treasury because it was the price of blood.<a name=177:4></a> They clean the outside of the platter to appear very religious and holy, within they are full of extortion and excess; as whited sepulchres, clean without, full of uncleanness within.<a name=177:5></a> They honoured the true witnesses of God who were of old, true children of those who had killed them, piously alleging that, had they lived then, they would not have been guilty of their blood.<a name=177:6></a> They would fill up the measure of their fathers.<a name=177:7></a> God would test them, sending them to prophets and wise men and scribes, as He did in the beginning of the gospel, and they would kill, scourge, and crucify them, that, the measure being filled up, all the righteous blood from Abel might be required of that generation.<a name=177:8></a>

		Ecclesiastical solemnity and superstition, and often with the profession of orthodoxy, have been the persecuting power and spirit of opposition to truth in every age and in every land.<a name=177:9></a> Look around and see where the traits here depicted are found, and see if it be not in hierarchy in the measure of its influence.<a name=177:10></a> Be it Jewish or Christian, it is the same story.<a name=177:11></a> If we go out to Mohammedans, nay, even to heathens, it is the same thing.<a name=177:12></a> But, specially in a pretended orthodox hierarchy, persecution and all the traits noted by Christ will be found.<a name=177:13></a> I appeal to every history in every land; for Jewish and Christian I may appeal to scripture, for though the chief priests were Sadducees, the scripture shews the same spirit of persecution, and the Pharisees and the doctors of the law fill up the rest of the picture, the Lord Himself being witness.<a name=177:14></a> Who delivered to the secular arm in Christendom, hypocritically asking for mercy?<a name=177:15></a> And as in Jerusalem for Jews, so in Babylon for Christendom, was found the blood of prophets and of saints and of all that were slain upon the earth.<a name=177:16></a> In the ecclesiastical power, from the pope downward, will be found in the measure of its realisation what the Lord describes here.<a name=177:17></a>

		Finally, verse 37, the Lord, though in words of tender compassion, pronounces judgment on Jerusalem.<a name=178:1></a> Often would Christ, Jehovah her Lord, have gathered her children together as a hen her chickens under her wings, but they would not; but now her history was closed, their house was left to them desolate, and, until they took up the children's cry, the words of Psalm 118, they would not see their Lord again.<a name=178:2></a> The repentance of Israel (as proposed in the intercession of Christ, Acts 3, but then refused) would be the signal of His return to them.<a name=178:3></a> It is of importance to see clearly what I have remarked, that the position of the disciples and their ministry is in Israel more exactly among the Jews.<a name=178:4></a> It helps us in understanding what follows.<a name=178:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The testimony of the Lord to the Jews was closed.<a name=178:6></a> Their house was left unto them desolate, they were not to see the Lord, the rejected One, till they repented, when the prophecy of Psalm 118 comes to be fulfilled.<a name=178:7></a> This testimony of the Lord could be received only by faith, and that is what is available for the disciples and guides him out of the way of awaited peril.<a name=178:8></a> But there is another key and interpreter of prophecy, the fulfilment of judgment.<a name=178:9></a> What is discerned only by faith when it is matter of faith, is made plain by events in judgment.<a name=178:10></a> Warning prophecies are of no avail when the judgment is executed.<a name=178:11></a> It is too late.<a name=178:12></a> Thus we find in symbolical prophecies and parables that the explanation always goes beyond what it explains.<a name=178:13></a> At any rate, making events the proof of the truth of a revelation, while perfectly true, is not the ground of the Christian nor of faith at all.<a name=178:14></a> The believer has God's word, and what concerns him in the prophecy is the warning or encouragement it affords when it is not fulfilled.<a name=178:15></a> What is a direction to flee to the mountains worth when the prophecy is fulfilled?<a name=178:16></a> Where is the exhortation to wait for Jehovah available in the midst of tribulation and trial with the prophetic assurance that He will come, but in the tribulation when He is not come?<a name=178:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Besides, prophecy is of no private interpretation; the whole plan and ways of God as to earthly government are unfolded.<a name=178:18></a> This is so in a very central and important point here, perhaps we may say, as to earth the most important of all.<a name=178:19></a> The throne of God had been on earth from the setting up of the tabernacle, and in a special way at Jerusalem from the dedication of the temple.<a name=178:20></a> This ceased at the Babylonish captivity.<a name=178:21></a> In the beginning of Ezekiel we see the glory on the threshold, then on the Mount of Olives, and then depart entirely.<a name=178:22></a> But a remnant of the two tribes were brought back to Jerusalem that Messiah might be presented to them, and He was so presented to them.<a name=178:23></a>

		The true temple indeed was His body, as He said to the Jews: still He owned the temple as His Father's house, though they had made it a den of thieves.<a name=179:1></a> Now the sad word came, "your house is left unto you desolate.<a name=179:2></a>" The Lord now predicts present judgment, in the destruction of it; and when they took this as the end of the age, and as the same time as His coming, He unfolds all God's ways as to their testimony in Israel, and then of the power of evil, and judgment at the end when He should come to the deliverance of His servants.<a name=179:3></a> The Lord had merely said their house would be desolate till He came.<a name=179:4></a> When His disciples, still possessed with the thought of the temporal glory of Israel, boasted in what they could shew Him, the buildings of the temple, He declares that not one stone of it should be left upon another.<a name=179:5></a>

		Then, on the disciples inquiring when the sign of His coming and of the end of the age would be, He unfolds the whole course of events as far as concerned Jerusalem, the disciples' testimony amongst that people when He was gone, and the state the Jews would get into, and the testimony such as He then could render it in the whole world; and, finally, in a distinct portion, the last events as they concerned them or those who might believe as they did.<a name=179:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The disciples connect what the Lord had already said with the end of the age and the hoped-for arrival of Messiah in glory which they awaited -- were obliged in such case to await, and they looked for signs.<a name=179:7></a> This last point He does not touch till verse 30.<a name=179:8></a> In verse 29 He tells of overwhelming judgments and the subversion of all things supposed to be regular and stable, but no previous sign is given.<a name=179:9></a> These are after the tribulation and usher in His coming when it takes place.<a name=179:10></a> From Luke we learn that there is anticipation of judgments, at least terror as to what is coming when they take place as far as Judaea goes.<a name=179:11></a>

		80 But I continue with Matthew.<a name=179:12></a> The prophecy divides at the end of verse 14, which verse goes to the end of the age.<a name=179:13></a> Then from verse 15 we have the special circumstances of Jerusalem and the tribulation there, closing in verses 29-31 with the coming of Christ and the gathering of the scattered Jews.<a name=179:14></a> But the Lord does not begin by satisfying their wish as a matter of curiosity, natural as it was, but treats it as a solemn matter as to their own service.<a name=179:15></a> His absence would put them to the test.<a name=179:16></a> The rejection by the Jews of the true Christ exposed them to every false pretender.<a name=179:17></a> Many would come in His name.<a name=179:18></a> So it is always; the rejection of a truth throws it, as it were, into the hands of Satan who gives his version of it to deceive.<a name=179:19></a> This is a solemn thing, and examples are not wanting of it.<a name=179:20></a> But the Lord is faithful.<a name=179:21></a> And here many would be deceived.<a name=179:22></a> Such deceivers suit themselves to the flesh, perhaps religious flesh, and the deception is great; men are religiously bad and hardened in evil and deep in delusion.<a name=179:23></a> We have had an example of it in Irvingism as to the coming of the Lord and the presence of the Holy Ghost, and a great and abiding one in the pretension (foolish as to fact, yet wise as to man) to unity in the Roman ecclesiastical body.<a name=179:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Further, besides the false Christs, political disturbances, restlessness, actual wars and rumours of them would attract attention and characterise the state of things on earth.<a name=179:25></a> But the disciples were not to be troubled; all this would come to pass, they were no signs of His coming, the end was not yet.<a name=179:26></a> Thus the Lord is caring for what would guide and strengthen His witnesses, keeping them calm and steady in their places.<a name=179:27></a> The end was not yet.<a name=179:28></a> He gives such instruction as would make them calm in service, not agitated with circumstances or by false hopes, neither to say, Lo!<a name=179:29></a> here, nor Lo!<a name=179:30></a> there, nor to be agitated by what agitated the world.<a name=179:31></a> They might still serve quietly on.<a name=179:32></a>

		But besides these things judgment would come: the contentions of nations, famine, pestilence, earthquakes in divers places.<a name=179:33></a> These were the beginning of the throes of Jewish sorrows in the midst of which they were to render their testimony.<a name=179:34></a> It was surely the heaving of the nations; but the effect considered is on the disciples in their service among the earthly people, though that testimony would go farther.<a name=179:35></a> But there was more.<a name=179:36></a> Their own immediate sorrows and trials; they would be delivered up to be afflicted, killed, hated of all the Gentiles for Christ's sake.<a name=179:37></a> But this persecution from without would produce defections within; many would be offended, would turn against those once companions and betray them and hate them, and, because of abounding iniquity, many hearts not nourished directly from the flame of Christ's love would wax cold.<a name=179:38></a> He that went through all the difficulty and pressure to the end would be saved.<a name=179:39></a> This gospel of the kingdom would be preached to the Gentiles, and then the end would come.<a name=179:40></a>

		In this passage the Lord seems to me to overleap the whole period in which we live, and gives the ministry of the disciples in the testimony they then had of the near setting up of the kingdom, in the midst of the Jews when He was gone and the house left desolate; and resumed when the Jews were again there to be spoken to; but especially to have in view the testimony amongst that people at the end.<a name=181:1></a> The destruction of Jerusalem interrupted this formally and judicially, and it would again be resumed when the church was gone, and be carried on in spite of opposition, till the end came.<a name=181:2></a> On to that end it clearly goes, and the present gospel of salvation is clearly passed over.<a name=181:3></a> Verse 14 comes in as an additional element by itself.<a name=181:4></a> In the beginning of His reply the Lord speaks of what would be applicable at any time after His departure, but soon passes essentially into what characterises the end in Judaea, and finally they are called to endure to the end.<a name=181:5></a>

		Thus the Lord has fully answered the question of the disciples, first in warnings as to their work in Judaea, available to them, then without any particular sign, save false Christs, and then more definitely what would introduce the end.<a name=182:1></a> There was a provisional end to service in Palestine and among the Jews as a nation, and a half-week of Daniel wholly unaccomplished; -- for unbelief a whole one.<a name=182:2></a> This is resumed or taken up again when the faithful have to endure to the end and be saved.<a name=182:3></a> Other details are given elsewhere, as in Revelation 11-13, but that is not our object here, only we have that half-week referred to generally here in what follows verse 15, a distinct revelation as to the events of that closing period which in the Old Testament is unfolded to us in Daniel 12, as it is alluded to in other places as in Jeremiah 30: 7, and in the word "indignation," and consumption decreed, though this last refers rather to what arrives on the close of the great tribulation; it gives the full guidance and instruction for service.<a name=182:4></a>

		I would further remark that any application of these parables to the Jewish remnant is a mere mistake; God's dealings with and by this remnant, as far as treated in this part of scripture, are unfolded in chapter 24 to the end of verse 31, and this connects itself as to historical events on earth directly with verse 31 of chapter 25.<a name=190:1></a> Verse 32 of chapter 24 begins personal exhortations to verse 44.<a name=190:2></a> These exhortations have their application to that remnant and close with personal separation by judgment, the spared one being left on earth.<a name=190:3></a> From verse 45 we pass over to general christian ground -- the disciples up to the destruction of Jerusalem having both positions (though the twelve and Paul had a different dispensational position), both founding the assembly; though its place was not yet revealed as afterwards by Paul, and carrying the last testimony to the Jewish people.<a name=190:4></a> Thus in Acts 2 you have church testimony; in Acts 3 you have remnant Jewish testimony.<a name=190:5></a> This closed morally with the death of Stephen, where we first find Saul as an adversary in ignorance, and judicially in the destruction of Jerusalem.<a name=190:6></a> Stephen began the departure to heaven, forming the heavenly company of Christians.<a name=190:7></a>

		The Lord is at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper: a woman comes (we know elsewhere it was Mary the sister of Lazarus; but here it is Jesus who is in view and the state of mind as to Him) and spends what she had most precious on Him -- right-hearted devotedness drawn out through grace by the growing power of evil.<a name=195:1></a> But the disciples, led away by the spirit of Judas, are indignant at what they call waste.<a name=195:2></a> To be sure, spending anything on Jesus is waste in the eyes of the world.<a name=195:3></a> On what is useful for man, it is not waste.<a name=195:4></a> Even, if worldly-wise wisdom does not see too much encouragement of the poor contrary to the rules of political economy, spending something on them is not waste; but on Christ devotedness of affection to Him -- to what purpose?<a name=195:5></a> Man's benefit may pass, but testimony of affection of heart to Him (be it that it only does that) cannot pass in the world, no, nor with disciples, where that devotedness is not.<a name=195:6></a> The calculations of hypocrites lead them astray, finding ready access to their heart in the state it is in.<a name=195:7></a> But the Lord owns it: care for the poor is all right and well; the Lord owns it, but love to Him, when the world's ruin and eternity depend on the manifestation of His self-sacrificing love, rejected or owned, is above all.<a name=195:8></a> It is not a corban to those who hold the place of priests, and use His name to the neglect of duty to God and those He has put us in relationship with; but a free and uncalculating heart which shews, as best it may, its unselfish devotedness to Him.<a name=195:9></a>

		Here all these deeply interesting parts of the scene are passed over, that the great fact of death in letting now His spirit go away from His body, really dying yet when in full strength, the dying but perfect and willing Victim might stand out before us in its own majesty and force.<a name=212:1></a> But all God's dispensation and God's creation, and the dead themselves, felt its power; yea, the rude heart of the Roman soldier was awed.<a name=212:2></a> The veil was rent, that which was the sign that man could not approach God.<a name=212:3></a> The whole Jewish dispensation in which man's responsibility to God was tested outside was rent from top to bottom; man's sin complete, and man down here had lost God for ever; but the way into the holiest, by a new and living way, fully opened.<a name=212:4></a> The sign of God's present power in creation was there; the earth quaked, and the rocks were rent, and the graves were opened, but none stirred till the first-fruits of them that slept had broken the bonds of death, and then they appeared to many in Jerusalem, the witness of the wondrous work that had been accomplished.<a name=212:5></a> No wonder all felt its power, or that God gave witness there even to what had glorified Him.<a name=212:6></a> He has indeed suffered His Son, in the accomplishment of divine counsels, to be despised and rejected of men, but we shall find that in His humiliation He has always taken care to give a testimony to His glory and what He was to Him.<a name=212:7></a> The raising of Lazarus, the riding into Jerusalem, the voice from heaven, and the dove; the dove and His own voice when He bows to enter in by the door with John, taking His place among the poor of the flock; the chorus of angels when He stooped to the incarnation, all are witnesses to His glory in the very place where He humbles Himself, and so it was here in the closing act of all.<a name=212:8></a> Nor did the heart of the centurion withstand the power of all that passed; a poor dark heathen, but at least not hardened as the unhappy Jews were religiously, and susceptible of these outward signs of divine power; he and those with him, struck with awe and fear, echoed at least with natural conscience the testimony Jesus gave of Himself when questioned by the priests, "Truly this man was the Son of God.<a name=212:9></a>"

		We cannot tell whether there was any divine and lasting operation, in his or the other's soul; we may hope.<a name=213:1></a> The object here was the public divine testimony given to the dying Lord that went home irresistibly to the hearts and consciences of those who watched Him, and brought out of their awed spirits the confession of who He was.<a name=213:2></a> The testimony had been spread abroad and even they knew that this was the thing in question -- Was He the Son of God?<a name=213:3></a> What unhardened heart could resist the witness?<a name=213:4></a>

		These chapters constitute the most distinct and definite portion of our Lord's service as a prophet.<a name=219:1></a> Strictly speaking, they only are the prophetic part of His ministry.<a name=219:2></a> The previous part of the Lord's history was the presentation of Himself as the object of previous prophecy, to those who were responsible for His reception as coming in by the door, according to that which those oracles of God had spoken concerning Him.<a name=219:3></a> This character and place of the Lord is particularly the subject of this Gospel, which bears in all its statements on the circumstances and condition in which the Jews were placed by previous scriptures.<a name=219:4></a> It closes in a very marked way in the previous chapter.<a name=219:5></a> The Lord had begun His ministry with the blessings of the character suited to His kingdom, revealed by the introduction of His Father's name.<a name=219:6></a> He closes on the continued and wilful rejection of Him by that people, by the woes justly denounced on them for their hypocrisy and iniquity.<a name=219:7></a> (Compare Matthew 5, 7, and 23.<a name=219:8></a>) From one evil they claimed exemption, but in terms which shewed their birthright in sin; they had not killed the prophets as their fathers had done.<a name=219:9></a> Jesus, assuming the character of Lord, hereon declares that He would send such unto them, and they should have an opportunity of shewing the difference of their spirit and conduct; then they would treat them in the same way, and, the measure of iniquity being filled up to the brim, God would dash the cup out of their hand to fill it with His own wrath to be poured upon them.<a name=219:10></a> Then the Lord apostrophises Jerusalem, for all this He speaks as the Lord; His beloved Jerusalem given up for the wickedness of them that dwelt therein, but still loved in itself and abstractedly in her children, and rejected with a "till," and not cast away as not foreknown, "Ye shall not see me henceforth till ye say, Blessed be he that cometh in the name of Jehovah.<a name=219:11></a>"

		This temple, and the circumstances of it, were then discussed by the Lord.<a name=222:1></a> The previous observations will have shewn how entirely Jewish in its character this discourse is; how Jewish is the base on which it rests.<a name=222:2></a> It is addressed to them, to whom all prophecy has its burden, the remnant who listened to the word, and here the Jewish remnant.<a name=222:3></a> They might obey the voice of His servant, but they were here walking in darkness, and seeing no light; for the Lord had left the house, and heavenly and resurrection glory was not yet brought in; nay they understood none of these things, no -- nor after the resurrection, till He opened their understandings; "they saw and believed, for as yet they understood not the scriptures, that he must rise again from the dead.<a name=222:4></a>"

		This then is the position of those to whom this Instruction or prophecy was addressed: the Jews in a rejected state, though not cast off -- in the land -- the house there but their house, not God's; disobeying and rejecting the Lord; a remnant ignorant of a resurrection Saviour,<a href="#222:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> entirely as to the truth, but obeying the voice of God's servant, but in the dark as to what such a state of things would be -- when, or how, to look for His coming -- what sign of it -- where the end of this state of things should be, and Messiah in glory be on the earth, even amongst them and they in the midst of, and connected with, though separate from, the body of the Jewish nation, and they (I do not say all Israel as well as the remnant who were obedient) all in the land together.<a name=222:5></a>

		This state of things is most important, I might say essential, to the right or any real understanding of these chapters; and to the close of them the prophetic word proceeds on this earthly basis, though it may superinduce other things.<a name=223:1></a> But it is the Lord Christ speaking as a prophet raised up from among His brethren, on and from earth, not as afterwards in Paul's epistle to them, and elsewhere, "from heaven," "partakers of the heavenly calling.<a name=223:2></a>" It may leave room for other things, as old prophecy did for the gospel; these are not the ground of the prophecy.<a name=223:3></a> This it is which makes the prophecy, while it might apply to the then condition of the disciples and direct their spirits in the details of present evil, have its force and weight, when the remnant should be in the condition which the disciples were then in, Christ only being gone; and here He spoke only as a prophet, so that it was the same thing, and that much more fully than when they were looking for heavenly things, seeing they were to put off their tabernacles, not to have "flesh saved," but to suffer in it, that they might be conformed to Him, and suffering reign with Him, having a good conscience by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who was gone into heaven; the God of all grace having called them to His eternal glory by Christ Jesus.<a name=223:4></a>

		The Lord does not therefore immediately answer them as to the time, because it would afford direction in many details then; its accomplishment is yet future, for the end of the age is not yet come.<a name=223:5></a> The Jewish remnant were still in His mind, those with whom He had identified Himself in their earthly sorrow (though not with them only), of which the Psalms are so full and blessed a declaration.<a name=223:6></a> And as Isaiah's prophecy had its accomplishment in the foreseen coming of Messiah, though it had truth in principle then, so Messiah's prophecy has its accomplishment at the period of the second coming and of the trouble preceding, though it had truth of application, while Jerusalem lasted as to many of its principles then, and would have guided the saints aright at the time, though it could not have fulfilled the types it created.<a name=223:7></a>

		The chapters are clearly divided into three portions: the Jewish, Christian, and Gentile advent of the Lord, or, His advent as applied to these three classes, as the apostle designates them -- the Jews, and Gentiles, and the church of God.<a name=224:1></a> The first portion, which is strictly Jewish in all its parts and exclusively so, reaches down to chapter 24: 44, then the church, or Christian part, begins, which is continued in different characters to chapter 25: 30.<a name=224:2></a> Verses 31-46 are the Gentiles.<a name=224:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Let me briefly recapitulate the position of the prophecy.<a name=224:4></a> Prophecy is the testimony of God's character and purpose upon the departure of those set in relationship with Himself from the standing in which they were originally placed by His revealed will and power.<a name=224:5></a> It condemns this departure, recalls to the original position and gives the purpose, and therefore object of hope, out of this state of ruin to the believing remnant, sorrowing over the evil; but it does this by shewing future incoming of blessing and glory in a new principle of grace and purpose.<a name=224:6></a> It necessarily refers therefore to Christ's coming, for His is the glory, and by Him comes the grace; but it always therefore testifies of abiding apostasy, because His coming is the proof of all previous failure, whether He come in grace or judgment; and this comforts and sustains the remnant under the failure.<a name=224:7></a> Thus Isaiah's prophecy -- "make the heart of this people fat" -- was on their departure from God; but it had, as we have seen (Matthew 13; John 12; Acts 28), its accomplishment in the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=224:8></a> The Lord first comes as the presented object of hope to the nation, fulfilling prophecy and doing every attractive work of mercy, and speaking as man never spake; but the heart of the people was fat.<a name=224:9></a> Then as Lord, for such He was, that Lord whose glory Isaiah had seen, and whence the word came, which glory was the judgment of their state, He gives them up, and, though He often would have gathered them, their house is left desolate.<a name=224:10></a> Here the prophecy met its accomplishment, and "this generation" stands the witness of its truth on the rejection of the Son; abidingly true has it proved the heart of the people was fat.<a name=224:11></a> The first coming of Christ, under the influence of which they still are, was its fulfilment, true as it always was.<a name=224:12></a> Our Lord then, on this state of things, takes up the prophetic character which is to have its consummation and fulfilment in His second coming; and hence (though there are many principles true in mediate application, just as the dullness and fatness of Israel's heart in the former prophecy) the prophecy treats of what is brought out in connection with the Lord's second coming, involving therefore not the Jews only, but the church and the Gentile, but as to all at His second coming.<a name=224:13></a> We have nothing then to look for here as fulfilment, but what takes place then.<a name=224:14></a>

		The relinquished temple is the thesis -- the Mount of Olives, the place whence He was to depart, and where His feet were to stand on His return, the suited place where His communications to the remnant of what was to be expected are given.<a name=225:1></a> I shall only very briefly present, after this introduction, what the chapters themselves present, without framing any system.<a name=225:2></a> It appears to me far the most wholesome way of inquiry; we know in part, I have seen no system which I do not believe false or extremely deficient.<a name=225:3></a> I repeat we know in part and yet all.<a name=225:4></a> These two statements shew the form of our knowledge.<a name=225:5></a>

		What precedes the coming of Christ is divided into two parts, general and particular, at verses 14, 15; verses 5 and 6 stand by themselves as a warning -- let no man deceive you -- be not troubled -- the end is not yet -- there would be false Christs -- and wars and rumours of wars; then the instruction.<a name=225:6></a> We must remember Jews are the subjects of it, but Jews owning Christ as a prophet, listening to Christ as a prophet, after He has given up Jerusalem, as Messiah, as the Lord had ceased to present Himself as the present object of faith.<a name=225:7></a> Nation should rise up against nation (verse 7).<a name=225:8></a> These were the beginning of sorrows, by which name we may describe this period, <i>the beginning</i> not <i>the end</i>.<a name=225:9></a> They were to be afflicted and delivered up to the Gentiles for His name sake, and be killed.<a name=225:10></a> This in the beginning of sorrows, evil amongst many associated with them apparently, treachery, coldness, false prophets, and many deceived, not yet false Christs; Antichrist being not yet distinctly revealed as a Jewish oppressor, and they (not he) should deliver up and kill them; the hatred was to be from the nations -- Gentiles.<a name=225:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		At the same time whoever endured unto the end should be saved.<a name=225:12></a> Further, as a great general fact, this gospel of the kingdom would be preached in all the world, for a witness to all the Gentiles, and the end of Jewish circumstances would not come till then; then it would.<a name=225:13></a> Now whatever analogy of principle there may be in the Lord's dealings (and I think there is), I believe strictly this is put in contrast with what we call the gospel.<a name=225:14></a> The death and resurrection of Christ could not be preached as the gospel before He was crucified and risen (previous to that His death was man's sin, though it were God's purpose); in the resurrection it could, because God had received it as atonement; but even Peter preaches it as their sin, and speaks of His return on their repentance, until further things came in.<a name=225:15></a> Stephen's death was the point of change as to this; but this gospel of the kingdom was, that the kingdom of heaven was at hand, that God was going to set up His kingdom, though from heaven, among the Jews, in the person of His Son, even the Lord Jesus Christ; and this was to be preached to the Gentiles before He did it, for this would be the end, and the Lord would, as He always does, send the testimony before He did the fact.<a name=225:16></a> It is this gospel of the kingdom, then, that is to be preached before the end comes of Jewish circumstances to Jewish disciples, and this to the nations.<a name=225:17></a> The cry to the virgins is the personal approach of Christ, the Bridegroom of the bride.<a name=225:18></a>

		From verse 15 we have a much more precise scene, a local scene; we have the holy place, and Daniel, and Judaea, and definite local circumstances, and prescribed conduct, when the abomination of desolation was seen standing in the holy place.<a name=226:1></a> "He that readeth, let him understand.<a name=226:2></a>" Then those in Judaea were to flee to the mountains, for then shall be great tribulation here when this idol dishonour is set up in the holy place; no more testimony, for they are the days of vengeance, in Jerusalem or Judaea; they are to flee to the mountains; for the elect's sake, however, these days of tribulation shall be shortened.<a name=226:3></a> Isaiah 65: 9-22 Will shew who these elect are.<a name=226:4></a> During this period there will not only be false prophets, but false christs, present promised deliverers from the great tribulation, "Jacob's trouble"; but the elect were told beforehand; they were to pray, being Jews, that their flight might not be on the sabbath.<a name=226:5></a>

		This was Jewish tribulation, from which the obedient remnant were exempt (they fled), and in which there was therefore no immediate testimony; not a period in which they were delivering up the remnant to the Gentiles.<a name=226:6></a> Nothing now was to be done.<a name=226:7></a> After this (verse 29) earthly power was to be put out in its imperial, derivative, and subordinate character, and the powers generally should be shaken.<a name=226:8></a> Then the sign of the Son of man would appear, and the tribes of the land (and indeed every eye) should see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven; and next, after this, He would send and gather, by His power and providence, the scattered remnant of Israel yet abroad in the world.<a name=226:9></a> These days of tribulation were shortened, that flesh might be saved -- the only salvation spoken of in this part of the chapter; and the taking would be as the taking in the days of Noah in judgment, the left as Noah's family in mercy.<a name=226:10></a>

		However the gift may be clearly recognised, and will be by spiritual judgment after it is used, yet faithfulness consists in using it in confidence in the Lord's character; unfaithfulness in waiting for something else.<a name=230:1></a> It cannot be personal grace thus characterised, if human appointment or any appointment by man be waited for.<a name=230:2></a><a href="#230:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> The points marked as the consequence on the Lord's return are two.<a name=230:3></a> First, there is a large reward given in government, ruler over many things.<a name=230:4></a> Secondly, actual personal association with Christ in blessing, not being blessed under Him as ruled over, but "Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.<a name=230:5></a>" It does not seem that the energy and power of the Holy Ghost is taken away, though the scene of its exercise may be different (rule and joy instead of trading as a servant), save from the unprofitable servant, who is cast outside the light and glory of the kingdom.<a name=230:6></a> Let us remember that faithfulness consists in the use of a gift upon the ground of personal individual confidence in the character of the Lord as our master; and that this is the evidence of grace; waiting for anything else, of the want of it.<a name=230:7></a> The not using the talent when he had it flowed from positively false notions of God, thoughts of evil, the absence of grace, and a principle entirely condemned by the Lord as the proof of evil.<a name=230:8></a>

		If we wish for a better understanding of the Holy Ghost's thought about Mark's Gospel, we must briefly examine His teaching in the four Gospels.<a name=233:1></a> These present Christ to us, but Christ rejected: and, at the same time, they present the Saviour in four different aspects.<a name=233:2></a> Again, there is a difference between the three first and the last.<a name=233:3></a> The three first present Christ as the One whom the world ought to receive, although in result He be put to death.<a name=233:4></a> In the fourth we find the Lord Jesus rejected already, from the first chapter; and again, too, the Jews considered as cast off: those who are born of God are the only ones who receive the Lord: consequently we find in this Gospel the principles of grace more deeply unfolded -- "No one can come unto me except the Father, who hath sent me, draw him"; and the sheep are distinct from the world before they are called.<a name=233:5></a> The first three Gospels present Christ to men in order that He may be received; then they give us the history of the increasing enmity of man against Him, and finally His rejection and death.<a name=233:6></a>

		As regards the character of each Gospel, in Matthew the Lord is considered as Emmanuel the promised Messiah, Jehovah who saves His people from their sins.<a name=233:7></a> "Jehovah the Saviour" is the meaning of the name Jesus.<a name=233:8></a> Consequently the genealogy descends from Abraham and David, the heads and vessels of the promises from whence the Messiah was to descend.<a name=233:9></a> In this first Gospel, when Christ is manifested in His true character, and in the spirit of His mission, He is morally rejected; and the Jews are set aside as a nation.<a name=233:10></a> The Lord seeks fruit in His vineyard no longer, but shews that He is really the sower; He reveals the kingdom, but in mystery (that is, in the manner in which it would exist in His absence); He reveals the church which He Himself would build, and the kingdom in its glorious state, which things should be substituted for His presence upon the earth; then the last events and discourses of His life.<a name=233:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Mark depicts the Servant-Prophet; and hence we have not the history of His birth; the Gospel begins with His ministry.<a name=233:12></a> We will speak afterwards of its contents.<a name=233:13></a> In the Gospel of Luke the Lord is presented to us as the Son of man, and in it we have a picture of grace, and of the work which is now going on; and the genealogy goes up to Adam.<a name=233:14></a> The two first chapters however reveal to us the state of the small though godly remnant amongst the Jews; a most exquisite picture of the working of the Spirit of God in the midst of the wicked and corrupt nation.<a name=233:15></a> These pious souls were well known to one another, they looked for the redemption of Israel; and the aged and godly Anna, who had seen the Saviour presented in the temple according to the law, announced to all who expected Him, the coming of the longed-for Messiah.<a name=233:16></a> In all the remaining part of this Gospel Christ is the Son of man for the Gentiles.<a name=233:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		234 In the Gospel by John we have no genealogy at all.<a name=233:18></a> The Word of God, which is also God, appears in flesh upon the earth -- He is the Creator, the Son of God.<a name=233:19></a> The world does not know Him.<a name=233:20></a> His own (the Jews) received Him not, but those who receive Him have the right to take the place of sons of God, being really born of Him.<a name=233:21></a> And since Christ is here presented as the manifestation of God, it is for this very cause that we find Him immediately rejected.<a name=233:22></a> This Gospel presents Him to us in His own person; then He putteth forth His own sheep, and gathers those of the Gentiles, and gives to them all eternal life, and they can never perish.<a name=233:23></a> At the end of this Gospel the coming of the Holy Ghost is explained to us: but let us begin to consider the Gospel by Mark.<a name=233:24></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have already said it begins with the Saviour's ministry.<a name=234:1></a> It is preceded only by the testimony of John.<a name=234:2></a> The latter prepares the way of the Lord, preaches the baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins, and announces a more glorious Servant of God, the latchet of whose shoes he is not worthy to unloose: He will baptize with the Holy Ghost.<a name=234:3></a> The baptism of fire is not mentioned here, because the subject is the Lord's service in blessing, and not that of exercising His power in judgment.<a name=234:4></a> Fire always signifies judgment.<a name=234:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord submits to John's baptism; this is a fact full of importance and blessing for man.<a name=234:6></a> Here He takes the place of His people before God: I need not say that the Lord could have no need of repentance; but He wishes to accompany His people in the first good step they take, that is, in the first step they take under the influence of the word.<a name=234:7></a> For Him it was the fulfilling of all righteousness.<a name=234:8></a> Everywhere where sin had brought us, love and obedience led Him for our deliverance.<a name=234:9></a> Only <i>here</i> He comes with His own: in <i>death</i> He took our place, He bore the curse, He was made sin.<a name=234:10></a> <i>Here</i> He takes His place as a perfect man in relationship with God -- with the Father; that place which He acquired for us by redemption in the which we are placed as sons of God.<a name=234:11></a>

		The heavens are opened: the Holy Spirit descends upon man.<a name=235:1></a> The Father recognises us as His children; Jesus was anointed and sealed by the Holy Ghost, even as we are; <i>He</i>, because He was personally worthy of it; <i>we</i>, because He has made us worthy by His work and by His blood.<a name=235:2></a> For us heaven is opened, the veil rent, and we cry, "Abba, Father!<a name=235:3></a>" Marvellous grace!<a name=235:4></a> Infinite love!<a name=235:5></a> The Son of God has become man in order that we also should become sons of God, as He Himself said after His resurrection: "I ascend unto my Father and your Father, unto my God and your God.<a name=235:6></a>" Glorious unspeakable purpose of God to place us in the same glory, in the same relationship as His own Son: in the glory to which He has a right by His own perfection as being God's own Son.<a name=235:7></a> "In order that he might shew in the ages to come the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness towards us, in Christ Jesus.<a name=235:8></a>" This will be fully accomplished when that which the Lord Jesus has said shall come to pass: "And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them .<a name=235:9></a>.<a name=235:10></a>.<a name=235:11></a> that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them as thou hast loved me.<a name=235:12></a>" Oh!<a name=235:13></a> what ought to be the love of Christians for the Saviour, who by His sufferings, even unto death, has acquired such a position for us, and the blessed assurance of being with Him and like Him for all eternity!<a name=235:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is also important to remark that here the Trinity is fully revealed for the first time.<a name=235:15></a> In the Old Testament we read of the Son and of the Holy Ghost; but here, where we have the position of the second Man according to grace, the Holy Trinity is fully revealed.<a name=235:16></a> At the same time the revelation is clear, and the three persons appear together; the Son is revealed as a man, the Holy Spirit descends like a dove, and the Father's voice owns Jesus in whom He is well pleased.<a name=235:17></a> We may notice here the difference between man's responsibility and the purpose of grace.<a name=235:18></a> God's purpose was fixed before the world was created, but it was fixed in the last Adam, the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=235:19></a> In the book of Proverbs (chapter 8) it is shewn that Christ, as Wisdom, was with God, that He was the object of God's delight, and that His own delight was found in the sons of men.<a name=235:20></a> But before revealing His counsels, or accomplishing the work which was to produce all the effects of this love, God created responsible man -- the first Adam.<a name=235:21></a> But Adam failed to accomplish his duty, and all the means that God has employed have only brought out the wickedness of man, until the second Man should come.<a name=235:22></a> Thus the delight which God had in man has been manifested.<a name=235:23></a>

		Nevertheless man has not been willing to receive it; there remained only the personal object of the perfect satisfaction of God; and thus in His person He has taken a position which we find revealed in this passage; that of Son of God, with the heaven opened, being sealed by the Holy Spirit.<a name=236:1></a> But He was alone.<a name=236:2></a> Upon the cross He did all that was necessary as regards our responsibility; and has done more -- has fully glorified God in His love, in His majesty, in His truth, and has acquired for us the participation in His own position as man in the glory of God; not indeed as the right of God, that is, His own right as Son, but to be like Him in glory, in order that He might be the firstborn among many brethren.<a name=236:3></a> This is God's purpose: and when the work of Christ was accomplished, this purpose was brought to light.<a name=236:4></a> As to its being fulfilled in us upon the earth, we have an example of it in the passage we are considering.<a name=236:5></a> Compare 2 Timothy 1: 9; Titus 1: 2, 3.<a name=236:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But this is not all.<a name=236:7></a> As soon as Jesus had taken His place before God as man, and when He had been manifested as Son of God in human nature, He is led by the power of the Holy Ghost into the wilderness, and there undertakes the struggle with the devil in the which the first Adam had been conquered.<a name=236:8></a> It was necessary that He should conquer in order to set us free; and notice too that His circumstances were very different from those in which the first Adam found himself.<a name=236:9></a> The first Adam was surrounded with God's blessings, of which He had full enjoyment; they were a present testimony of His favour.<a name=236:10></a> Christ, on the contrary, was in the desert with the consciousness that Satan was now reigning over man, and all outward comforts are wanting; outwardly there was no testimony of God's goodness: indeed all was contrary to this.<a name=236:11></a>

		In Mark the details of the temptation and the Lord's replies are not given, but only the fact is recorded (a precious fact for us) that the Lord has passed through this trial.<a name=237:1></a> He presented Himself according to the will of God, led of the Holy Ghost to meet the powerful enemy of mankind; immense grace!<a name=237:2></a> He first shewed our place before God, having taken it in His own person; and then He entered into conflict with the devil who held us captive.<a name=237:3></a> The third fact that we observe is that the angels have become the servants of those who shall be heirs of salvation.<a name=237:4></a> Here, then, are the three testimonies in connection with the manifestation of Jesus as man in the flesh; -- our position as sons of God, Satan conquered, the angels our servants.<a name=237:5></a>

		The Saviour (verse 14), having taken His place in the world, begins the exercise of His ministry, but not before John's imprisonment.<a name=237:6></a> After that this forerunner of the Messiah was cast into prison, and not before, the Saviour began to preach the gospel of the kingdom.<a name=237:7></a> The testimony of John was very important to draw the people's attention to Him; but it would not have been right that he should have borne testimony to the Lord after that He Himself had begun to bear testimony to Himself.<a name=237:8></a> "I receive not testimony from man," saith the Lord, speaking of John the Baptist; John 5: 34.<a name=237:9></a> He bore witness to John!<a name=237:10></a> He was the Truth in His own person, and His words and His works were the testimony of God in the world.<a name=237:11></a> "What sign doest thou?<a name=237:12></a>" said the people; "our fathers did eat manna in the desert .<a name=237:13></a>.<a name=237:14></a>.<a name=237:15></a> .<a name=237:16></a>" And the Lord replied, "I am the bread come down from heaven.<a name=237:17></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The preaching of Jesus announced the kingdom, shewed that the time was fulfilled, that the kingdom of God was at hand, that the people must repent and believe the gospel.<a name=237:18></a> We should distinguish between the gospel of the kingdom and the gospel of our salvation.<a name=237:19></a> Christ is the centre of both; but there is a great difference between the preaching of a kingdom which is drawing near, and that of an eternal redemption accomplished upon the cross.<a name=237:20></a> It is quite possible that the two truths should be announced together.<a name=237:21></a> And indeed we find that the apostle Paul preached the kingdom, but he certainly also proclaimed an eternal redemption accomplished for us upon the cross.<a name=237:22></a> Christ prophesied of His death, and announced that the Son of man should give His life for the ransom of many; but He could not announce an accomplished redemption during His life.<a name=237:23></a> Men ought to have received Him and not to have put Him to death: hence His testimony was about the kingdom which was drawing nigh.<a name=237:24></a>

		This kingdom in its public power has been delayed, because Christ has been rejected (see Revelation 11: 17); and this delay lasts all the time that Christ is sitting at the right hand of God, until the time when He shall arise from the throne of His Father to judge.<a name=238:1></a> God has said, "Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool," Psalm 110.<a name=238:2></a> It is nevertheless true that the kingdom was already come in mystery according to Matthew 13; this goes on during the time that Jesus is seated at the right hand of God.<a name=238:3></a> But when God's appointed moment shall come, the Lord will arise and set up the kingdom, and with His own power will judge the living; and peace and happiness shall be established upon the earth.<a name=238:4></a> And we who have received Him, whilst the world has rejected Him, shall go to meet Him in the air, we shall be for ever with the Lord, and shall come with Him in glory when He shall appear before the world, and shall reign with Him; and, what is still far better, we shall be like Him and always with Him in the heavenly places in the Father's house.<a name=238:5></a>

		The development of these truths and of these events is only found in the word of God after the Lord's ascension, after that the foundation for the accomplishment of God's purpose had been laid in the Saviour's death.<a name=238:6></a> Here He announces only the drawing nigh of the kingdom, for men should have received it.<a name=238:7></a> But although Jesus taught in all the synagogues, there were not only those who heard Him, or who believed what He taught, but some who also followed Him.<a name=238:8></a> It is of the greatest importance to notice this: many in the present day profess to have received the gospel; but how small is the number of those who follow the Lord in the path of faith, in that humility and obedience which characterised the Lord's steps in this world!<a name=238:9></a> Let us try to follow Him: perhaps we cannot literally forsake all, as the first disciples did; but we can walk in the spirit in which they walked, and esteem Christ as the all for our souls; and that all other things are but as dung in order that we may win Christ in glory.<a name=238:10></a> The Lord here calls men to make them fishers of others; let us also seek others, that they too may be able to enjoy the ineffable and glorious happiness which the Holy Spirit gives.<a name=238:11></a> We may not be apostles perhaps, but whoever is full of Christ will give testimony to Christ; out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.<a name=238:12></a> Rivers of living water shall flow from the belly of him who comes to Christ and drinks; John 7.<a name=238:13></a>

		The Gospel by Mark does not present the person of Emmanuel, and then the grace of His mission, as that by Matthew; but sets forth rapidly His ministry in its application to men.<a name=239:1></a> Necessarily the ministry is the same, but the development is different.<a name=239:2></a> His word and His works testify equally to the authority with which He taught the people.<a name=239:3></a> While He was speaking, the audience in the synagogue was astonished, for His speech was not like that of the scribes who insisted upon opinions, but He announced the truth as One who knew it and could present it from its very foundation.<a name=239:4></a> Even evil spirits were afraid of His presence, and prayed that they might not be destroyed.<a name=239:5></a> Nevertheless they were obliged to leave the wretched men whom they held as their prey under their power: so that the people said, "What is this?<a name=239:6></a> what is this doctrine?<a name=239:7></a>" A testimony was raised that God had intervened to set man free, and to communicate His perfect truth to him.<a name=239:8></a> Grace and truth had come by Jesus Christ.<a name=239:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		His fame spread all over Galilee.<a name=239:10></a> Leaving the synagogue He enters into the house of Simon and Andrew: the apostle Peter had a wife, and her mother was sick of a fever.<a name=239:11></a> The Lord takes her by the hand; the fever disappears, and the woman begins to serve them in a perfect state of health.<a name=239:12></a> As soon as the sabbath is ended, all the city is gathered together at the door of the house: the Lord heals the sick and casts out demons; the demons recognise Him although men have not.<a name=239:13></a> Still He remains the Servant of God, and gets up before sunrise to go into a solitary place to pray.<a name=239:14></a> Peter seeks Him and, having found Him, says, "All seek thee": but Jesus, always the Servant, does not seek numbers and fame for Himself, but goes away elsewhere to preach and to bring freedom from the yoke of Satan.<a name=239:15></a>

		It is important to remark that here the Lord's miracles are not simply a sign and proof of power, but also of the goodness which was acting in divine power.<a name=239:16></a> It is this which gives the true divine character to the miracles of Jesus.<a name=239:17></a> All His works are the fruit of love, and bear witness to the God of love upon the earth.<a name=239:18></a> There is only one apparent exception, which, after all, is a proof of the truth we are remarking.<a name=239:19></a> This exception is the cursing of the fig-tree; but this was a figure of the people Israel, and one may say of human nature, under God's cultivation, which did not produce fruit -- there were only leaves, that is, hypocrisy.<a name=239:20></a> Hence it was judged and condemned, and will never bear fruit again; the gardener dug about it, and dunged it, but all was useless; and then it was given up of God.<a name=239:21></a> Man must be born again -- must be created again in Christ Jesus.<a name=239:22></a>

		Of the love manifested in the works of the Lord Jesus we have a beautiful proof in that which follows.<a name=240:1></a> A leper comes to Jesus well persuaded of His power, having seen His miracles, or heard tell of these mighty works; but he was not certain that he would find willingness in Him to heal him.<a name=240:2></a> He says to Him, "If thou wilt, thou canst.<a name=240:3></a>" The Lord, not content with being willing and with doing, touches the leper.<a name=240:4></a> Now leprosy -- terrible disease!<a name=240:5></a> -- was a figure of sin, and he that was ill of it was shut out of the camp as unclean; and even a man who might have touched him was shut out too, because he became contaminated by it.<a name=240:6></a> No means could be employed to cure the leper; it was Jehovah alone who could cure him; and then, when cured of Jehovah, the priest pronounced him clean, and he could, after certain ceremonies, partake of divine worship.<a name=240:7></a> Here the Lord comes in with this divine power and the love of God.<a name=240:8></a> "I will, be thou clean.<a name=240:9></a>" The willingness and power of God were there, and were exercised in favour of the poor excommunicated man.<a name=240:10></a> But there is something more -- He touches the sufferer.<a name=240:11></a> God is present; Jesus cannot be contaminated; but He has come so near to the unclean man as to be able to touch him -- true Man amongst men, God manifest in flesh.<a name=240:12></a> God, but God in a man, love itself, the power which can do all necessary to deliver man from the effect of Satan's power.<a name=240:13></a> Undefilable purity is found upon earth -- but love as well, that is, God is here, but Man also -- and works for man's blessing.<a name=240:14></a> The leper is healed immediately, the leprosy disappears.<a name=240:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But although God be manifested in His work of power and love, He does not leave the servant's place, now that He has taken it; He sends away the healed man, saying, "See that thou say nothing to any man; but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded.<a name=240:16></a>" We may remark another circumstance in this history -- that the Lord was moved with compassion when He saw the leper.<a name=240:17></a> God, in His love, is man touched with pity in His heart for the wretched state in which He finds man: we often find this fact in the Gospels.<a name=240:18></a> Now the cleansed leper spreads abroad the fame of Jesus all around, so that the testimony of the power of God present with His people makes itself felt in men's minds.<a name=240:19></a> Jesus did not seek human glory, but to accomplish the will of God and the work He had given Him to do.<a name=240:20></a> Surrounded by all, He cannot enter into the city, where the astonished crowd would have assembled itself around Him.<a name=240:21></a>

		The scribes and Pharisees raise the question as to how it could be possible that a righteous teacher should sit and eat with unclean men and sinners.<a name=243:7></a> Jesus hears this, and answers with divine wisdom.<a name=243:8></a> The simplicity of the answer equals its force.<a name=243:9></a> "They that are whole have no need of a physician, but they that are sick; I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.<a name=243:10></a>" Here it is grace that is working; and the work of Jesus presents a full contrast to the law.<a name=243:11></a> The law demanded human justice from man; Christ and the gospel announce divine grace which reigns and reveals God's righteousness.<a name=243:12></a> Here we have grace; as to divine righteousness, it should be fully revealed when Christ should have accomplished His work upon the cross: truth as important as it is precious!<a name=243:13></a>

		Christ, the Saviour, came to seek sinners, and does not seek righteous persons; even were there any such, there would be no need to seek them, but in His sovereign grace and perfect goodness He came to seek sinners; He does not send them away but seeks them, and can sit and eat with them whilst being Himself altogether holy.<a name=243:14></a> This is the manifestation of God in love in the midst of sinners to win the hearts of men, and to produce confidence toward God in these hearts, and to bind all the faculties of the soul with the power of a perfect object, and to form it according to the image of that which leads it, and which it contemplates; whence to inspire this confidence, since good was come into the midst of evil, and had taken part in the wretchedness in which fallen man lay -- a goodness which did not drive away the sinner on account of his sins, but which invited him to come.<a name=243:15></a>

		Man's ruin began when he lost his confidence in God: the devil had succeeded in persuading Eve that God had not permitted man to eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, because He knew that, if he did it, he would be as God, knowing good and evil; that God had forbidden him to touch the tree from jealousy; and, if He did not wish that we should be happy, we must make ourselves happy.<a name=244:1></a> And this is what Eve sought, and what all men seek who do their own will.<a name=244:2></a> Thus man fell, and thus man remains in all the wretchedness which is the fruit of sin, awaiting God's judgment upon the sin itself.<a name=244:3></a> Now, before executing judgment God came in love as Saviour to shew that His love is greater than sin, and that the worst sinner can have confidence in this love that seeks sinners and adapts itself to their wants, which does not demand righteousness from man, and brings him salvation and grace by which to present him finally to God as His righteousness through the work of Christ: but He comes in love to sinful men to reconcile them with Himself.<a name=244:4></a> Instead of punishing them for their sins, He finds occasion to manifest the immensity of His love in coming to those who were lying in sin, and in giving Himself as a sacrifice to put it away.<a name=244:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In His life Christ presents this love of God, God Himself manifested in love to man; in His death He is as man before God, made sin for us in order that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him, and that the righteous God, the God of love, never might remember our sins.<a name=244:6></a> In the history which we are considering He manifests God's love towards man.<a name=244:7></a> The law was the perfect rule of that which man ought to be as son of Adam; it demanded of man that he should be such, and pronounced a curse upon the man who did not do that which it required.<a name=244:8></a> It added God's authority to that which was fitting to the relationships in which man finds himself, and gave a perfect rule for conduct to man in these relationships; a rule easily forgotten or broken in the fallen state of man.<a name=244:9></a> It did not give life, nor strength, nor objects to attract and rule the heart; but it established the relationship of man with God and with his fellows, and cursed all those who had not kept it, that is, all those that were under it.<a name=244:10></a>

		The flesh does not submit, nor can it submit to the law of God: grace then, whilst it establishes the authority of the law and the curse itself, since Christ the blessed Saviour has borne it, must needs change everything in the ways of God.<a name=245:1></a> Forgiveness is not the same as the curse, and paying a debt is very different from demanding the money.<a name=245:2></a> It is quite just to demand payment, but, if the debtor has nothing to pay, he is ruined; whereas, if he pays, he is set free.<a name=245:3></a> Christ has done more; not only does He pay the debt, but He has acquired glory for those that believe.<a name=245:4></a> Not only has He freed the debtor from his debts, but He has given him an immense fortune in God's presence.<a name=245:5></a>

		But then the change is complete and perfect, and the Lord's words which follow shew us this.<a name=245:6></a> John's disciples and the Pharisees used to fast, and the Lord gives motives why His own could not do it.<a name=245:7></a> The Bridegroom was present and so it was not the time for fasting, but the time would soon come when the Bridegroom would be taken away; and then they should fast.<a name=245:8></a> The joy of His presence would be turned into sorrow by His absence, by the need which this absence would create in the heart.<a name=245:9></a> The other reason is this: it was impossible to mix the two systems; the new wine (the truth and the spiritual power of Christianity) could not be put into old bottles, into the old institutions and ceremonies of Judaism.<a name=245:10></a> If this were done, the new wine would destroy the bottles, and both would be spoiled, the wine would be lost and the bottles destroyed.<a name=245:11></a> In like manner a piece of new cloth does not suit an old garment: the garment would be torn, and the rent would only be greater.<a name=245:12></a> Indeed it is not possible to attach the spiritual power of Christianity to the carnal ceremonies which human nature loves, because it can make of them a religion without a new life, and without the conscience being touched.<a name=245:13></a> The unconverted man, if he wishes, may thus do as much good as the converted man.<a name=245:14></a> No, the new wine must be kept in new bottles: it is important for us to remember it.<a name=245:15></a> The dispensation was changed, a new order was coming in, and all was altered; the nature of the things was different -- they could not exist at the same time; fleshly ceremonies and the power of the Holy Ghost could never go together.<a name=245:16></a> Think of it, Christians!<a name=245:17></a> Christianity has tried to embellish itself with these ceremonies, and often even under Pagan forms; and what has it become?<a name=245:18></a> It has adapted itself to the world of which these forms were the rudiments, and has become really pagan, and its true spirituality can hardly be found at all.<a name=245:19></a>

		But there was an institution founded by God, that is, the sign of His covenant with Israel -- the sabbath -- and it was too the sign of God's rest in the first creation.<a name=246:1></a> Now, in Israel man was put to the proof, to see whether, with a perfect rule, and with means offered by the law (God Himself being present in the tabernacle or temple), he could serve God and fulfil righteousness as a son of Adam in the flesh.<a name=246:2></a> The sabbath was not "a" seventh day but "the" seventh day, in the which at the end of creation God ceased creating, and rested.<a name=246:3></a> The question then arose as to whether man could share God's rest: and the answer is, that he has sinned, and therefore can never have any part in this rest.<a name=246:4></a> Under the law he was again put to the proof; and then he made the golden calf before Moses came down from the mountain.<a name=246:5></a> God then exercised patience with the people until they rejected Christ.<a name=246:6></a> But it was impossible to establish a covenant between God and man after the flesh; man could not enjoy God's rest.<a name=246:7></a> More than this; the sabbath of the first creation was for man, and He who enjoyed all the rights of man according to God's counsels was Lord of the sabbath: thus these two principles are unfolded.<a name=246:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, as when David, the anointed of the Lord, had been rejected, everything was common and profane; so when Christ, the last proof offered to man in the flesh, was rejected, nothing was holy for man; the seal of the first covenant had lost all its meaning.<a name=246:9></a> Then, when Christ renounces for a time His position in Israel as Messiah, He becomes (as we see often in the Gospels, Luke 9: 21, 22, etc.<a name=246:10></a>) the Son of man.<a name=246:11></a> Thus He is the Lord of the sabbath which was made for man; thus the sign of the old covenant disappears through man's sin and his rejection of Christ.<a name=246:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		247 Christ's resurrection is the beginning of the new creation, the foundation of the new covenant founded upon His blood.<a name=246:13></a> This is the sign of God's rest for us.<a name=246:14></a> Satisfied, glorified by the death of Jesus, God has raised Him from among the dead and has found a resting-place for His love and His righteousness; and we, the objects of this love, are made the righteousness of God in Christ.<a name=246:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus the Lord's day is a most precious gift from Him, and the true Christian enjoys it with all his heart; and, if he is faithful, he finds himself in the Spirit to enjoy God, happy to be freed from material labour to adore God as his Father, and to enjoy communion with the Lord.<a name=246:16></a> It is always a bad sign when a Christian talks of his liberty and makes use of it to neglect the Lord, in order to give himself to the material work of the world.<a name=246:17></a> However free a Christian may be, he is free from the world and from the law, in order to serve the Lord.<a name=246:18></a> How much good may he not do on the Lord's day!<a name=246:19></a> And this is a third principle which is found in chapter 3 in this Gospel.<a name=246:20></a>

		Grace had come (John 1: 17), God Himself was present in grace; and this grace was free to do good on the sabbath.<a name=247:1></a> The Lord's true rest is the exercise of His love in the midst of evil.<a name=247:2></a> The Pharisees thought nothing of doing evil provided that their traditions were observed.<a name=247:3></a> God held Himself at liberty to do good; and for this reason the Lord heals the withered hand, calling the Jew's attention to this great principle in a formal way.<a name=247:4></a>

		At the same time we see how the Lord's testimony is received: His own friends think Him mad; and the leaders of the people ascribe His wonderful works to the power of Satan.<a name=248:22></a> O what a world we live in!<a name=248:23></a> Man can see nothing in the activity of divine goodness but madness and the work of the devil.<a name=248:24></a> But surely Satan does not cast out Satan: it is this that is real folly.<a name=248:25></a> If a strong man's goods are taken from him, it is clear that a stronger has come and has bound him.<a name=248:26></a> May God be praised!<a name=248:27></a> But this sin -- blasphemy against the Holy Ghost -- cannot be pardoned.<a name=248:28></a> Whilst they said, "We do not believe: this man does not keep the sabbath, he deceives us," although it was bad enough, it was pardonable; but the scribes recognised the power -- a power greater than that of demons, and, instead of owning there the finger of God, they ascribed it to the prince of the demons -- called the Holy Ghost a demon.<a name=248:29></a> It was the end of all hope for Israel, as regards his responsibility.<a name=248:30></a> Grace could forgive the nation, and will do it when the Lord shall return in glory; but now, as a responsible people, their story is ended.<a name=248:31></a>

		In that which follows, we have, I think, a picture of the departure of Jesus, and of His power; the security of His own even when He seemed to be indifferent to their difficulties; then the relationship in which He stood towards the Jews.<a name=252:7></a> Jesus, having sent away the multitude, gets into a boat and goes to sleep whilst a tempest arises upon the lake, so that the waves fill the boat.<a name=252:8></a> The disciples, full of fear, come to Jesus to awaken Him; Jesus arises, rebukes the wind, and says to the sea, "Peace, be still," and all is quiet.<a name=252:9></a> But then He reproves the unbelieving fear of the disciples; and indeed, reader, do you think that the power of the Son of God, God's counsels, could have failed because of an unexpected storm on the lake of Gennesaret?<a name=252:10></a> Impossible!<a name=252:11></a> the disciples were in the same boat with Jesus.<a name=252:12></a> Here is a lesson for us: in all the difficulties and dangers of the christian life, during the whole journey upon the waves, often agitated by the tempestuous sea of life and of christian service, we are always in the same boat with Jesus, if we are doing His will.<a name=252:13></a> It may seem to us that He is sleeping; nevertheless, if He allows the tempest to rise in order to prove our faith, we shall not perish since we are <i>with Him</i> in the storm; evidently neither He nor we can perish.<a name=252:14></a> He may seem sometimes to be indifferent to our fate; but I repeat we are <i>with Him</i>; His security is our own.<a name=252:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		If calming the winds and the sea shews the Lord's power over creation, that which follows shews it over demons; He casts out a Legion by His word.<a name=253:1></a> But now we find the effect of the manifestation of His power upon the world, even where it worked for the deliverance of men.<a name=253:2></a> They beseech Jesus to depart, and He goes away.<a name=253:3></a> Poor world!<a name=253:4></a> the quiet influence of Satan upon the heart is more disastrous than His outward and visible power; this is sad enough, but the power of the Lord is quite sufficient to drive it away: whereas, on the other hand, the quiet influence of Satan in the heart drives away Jesus Himself.<a name=253:5></a> And remark that, when the presence of God is felt, it is more terrible than that of Satan; man would wish to free himself from the latter, but cannot; but the presence of God is <i>insupportable</i> when it makes itself felt: and indeed man has driven God (in the person of Christ) out of this world.<a name=253:6></a> Jesus gave Himself for us, it is true; but, as regards man's responsibility, he has driven out the Lord.<a name=253:7></a> I do not doubt that all this scene is the representation of the end of the Lord's history; and that the swine present to us the end of the Jews, who were hurried into perdition as possessed of the devil at the end of their history.<a name=253:8></a> The world did not wish to have Jesus; the Jews are cast down into hopeless ruin.<a name=253:9></a>

		The man who is cured is quiet; he wishes to be with Jesus who is going away, but this is not allowed him.<a name=253:10></a> He must go and announce to others what God has done for him.<a name=253:11></a> Here is the position of the disciples and of all Christians after the Lord's departure from this world.<a name=253:12></a> They desire to go and be with Him, but are sent again into the world to declare the blessed work that the Lord has done in their own persons; they can by their own experience say what is the grace and the power of Jesus.<a name=253:13></a> But how deplorable is the state of the world and of man!<a name=253:14></a> The presence of the devil is more tolerable for him than that of God.<a name=253:15></a> He would wish to check the violent manifestations of the power of Satan, but cannot -- the bands are burst asunder, and the man is as bad as ever.<a name=253:16></a> God is not a tyrant like Satan; He is good, full of grace, and frees men in Christ from Satan's power; but, this being the proof of the presence and power of God, man shews that His presence is insupportable to him, even when God manifests Himself as the deliverer from all the evils which sin and Satan's power have introduced.<a name=253:17></a>

		The history which follows reveals the true relationships between Jesus and Israel.<a name=254:1></a> Jesus came to heal Israel; but Israel was in fact dead, speaking spiritually; when Jesus arrived, it was necessary to raise him, if it were God's will that he should live; the Lord could do it, and will do it for this nation in the last days.<a name=254:2></a> But then being in the way with the people, the crowd of Israel surrounded Him; and, if individual faith touched Him, the person was healed, and this is what happened to the poor afflicted woman.<a name=254:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us notice some of the details of the story: -- the Lord distinguishes between true faith and the eagerness of the crowd which was attracted by His miracles and by the benefits it had received.<a name=254:4></a> Sincerity was not wanting in the crowd, the people saw the miracles and enjoyed their effects, but they had not faith in the person of Jesus.<a name=254:5></a> But there was good in the woman, by grace, that which is always found in faith, a felt need and the perception of the excellence of His person, and of the divine power that was in Jesus, accompanied with true humility with regard to herself.<a name=254:6></a> The poor woman is sure that, if she touch only the hem of His garment, she shall be healed; and in fact it is this that takes place.<a name=254:7></a> As soon as the woman is healed, Jesus perceives that the power which is in Him, and which has gone out from Him to the woman, has worked with efficacy.<a name=254:8></a> And it is always thus: many can hear the gospel and delight to listen to it, but faith is another thing; and faith always receives the Lord's answer to the need which it presents to Him.<a name=254:9></a> He may make one wait, if He finds it good to exercise the faith, but He always answers in love: the woman is perfectly healed.<a name=254:10></a> Faith makes the believer humble about his wretchedness; the woman wished to remain hidden, but the Lord encourages the believer, saying in this instance, "Daughter, be of good comfort, thy faith hath saved thee, go in peace.<a name=254:11></a>" However timid and fearful the soul may be in the Lord's presence in spiritual things, and however much it may feel its wretchedness, when the call is true, it opens out and confesses His grace, not the misery which had rendered this grace needful.<a name=254:12></a> It is then that the Lord encourages and speaks peace to the heart.<a name=254:13></a> Personal faith is here plainly distinguished from the eagerness of the crowd which followed Him, whether for curiosity, or for the benefits which Jesus conferred upon it.<a name=254:14></a> But the power of resurrection was found in Him and through Him.<a name=254:15></a> Israel, though dead, was only sleeping: the Lord's voice will call him into life in His time.<a name=254:16></a>

		But however great His divine power, He was manifested in a form that could lend nothing to the pride and vanity of human nature.<a name=255:1></a> Man was responsible to receive Him because He manifested the character of the Godhead: He would not flatter and give support to human passions, nor to those of the Jews as a nation.<a name=255:2></a> If man is to receive God, he must receive what God is; but this is just what his fallen nature will not do.<a name=255:3></a> The divine character was much more fully manifested in the humiliation of Jesus, than if He had come as a glorious King; but He was not that which man's heart desired.<a name=255:4></a> He was the carpenter's son, and that was enough to cause His rejection.<a name=255:5></a> They judged according to the flesh: the kindred of Jesus were in their midst; and they did not look any farther.<a name=255:6></a> Astonished at their unbelief, He leaves them after having done that which the wants of some of them demanded, for His grace never failed.<a name=255:7></a> A prophet is not without honour but in his own country; for it is there that he is known according to the flesh.<a name=255:8></a> So it was with Jesus, not only in Nazareth, but also in Israel.<a name=255:9></a> Remark what an obstacle unbelief is to the exercise of the power of God.<a name=255:10></a> The faith of the sick woman who touches His garment causes His power to come out, but the unbelief of the inhabitants of His own country hinders its exercise.<a name=255:11></a> We find, "He could not do any mighty work there," etc.<a name=255:12></a> May God grant that we may not put any obstacle to the activity of His grace, which is always ready to act; but, on the contrary, may we know what it is to profit by His power by causing it to act towards us by faith; chapter 6: 1-6.<a name=255:13></a>

		Now the Lord sends His disciples to preach, and we have a proof of His power more remarkable than that of His own miracles.<a name=256:1></a> He gives them the power to perform miracles themselves, power to cast out all demons.<a name=256:2></a> This is a power evidently divine; God makes man capable to perform signs and wonders; but what <i>man</i> can give this power to another?<a name=256:3></a> Christ gave it, and His disciples, capacitated by His gift, cast out demons in reality: Christ was God manifest in grace upon the earth.<a name=256:4></a> We have already called attention to the fact that all the Lord's miracles, and those of His disciples are not only the results of power, such as the miracles of Moses, of Elias, etc.<a name=256:5></a>, but they are the fruits of divine goodness.<a name=256:6></a> One may except the cursing of the fig-tree, but this after all is a proof of the same thing.<a name=256:7></a> The testimony of the Lord, stamped as it was with love, and confirmed by His miraculous works, had been rejected; and Israel -- man's heart -- under the influence of this goodness, of the manifestation of God, of all the care which God had lavished upon it, had not brought forth any fruit.<a name=256:8></a> Therefore the bad tree is judged for ever, so that it can never bear fruit again.<a name=256:9></a> Thus man, having shewn himself to be nothing but guilty, and so guilty, that all the means employed by God, even to the gift of His only-begotten Son, have been found to be unable to awaken a single good sentiment towards God, as to his state in the flesh, he is finally rejected of God.<a name=256:10></a> God can save him in giving him a new nature by the Holy Spirit, but in himself he is without hope.<a name=256:11></a> Who will do more than that which God has done?<a name=256:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		More than this; the Lord has not only power to give to His disciples authority over evil spirits, but He can also dispose of human hearts.<a name=256:13></a> The disciples were to start without taking anything for their journey; and nevertheless, as we read in Luke, the disciples bore witness, in answer to the Lord, that they had wanted for nothing.<a name=256:14></a> Sustained by the power of Emmanuel, whose power extended everywhere, and armed with His authority, they were to stay in the house into which they had entered until their departure from each place.<a name=256:15></a> Thus they were to conform themselves to this mission; possessing the Lord's authority for their message, they were to act accordingly.<a name=256:16></a> And wherever their message should not be received, they were to shake the dust off their feet as a witness against that city, whose fate should be worse than that of Sodom and Gomorrha.<a name=256:17></a> It is true that the Lord, full of goodness and patience, sent seventy disciples again before His face when He went up to Jerusalem at the end of His career upon earth, and these were to preach the gospel.<a name=256:18></a> But as to the principle of the mission, that which we find in Mark was the last testimony given to Israel before the judgment of the nation.<a name=256:19></a> This was to be a last appeal to the conscience and heart of the people, in order that it might receive the Saviour and repent and turn to God and escape the terrible judgment that awaited it; and that there might be at least a remnant which, moved by the powerful word of God, might return to God to enjoy His goodness in the Saviour, and a better hope than Judaism had been able to give them.<a name=256:20></a>

		The disciples went forth preaching that men were to repent.<a name=257:1></a> What grace there is in the sending forth of the gospel!<a name=257:2></a> Not only does God give us to enjoy salvation and His love, but employs men as the instruments of the activity of His love.<a name=257:3></a> O how we ought to bless God that He condescends to make use of us to carry the testimony of His ineffable love and of His truth to men's hearts -- at least to their ears, in order that He Himself may cause it to reach their hearts in His grace!<a name=257:4></a> May we know at least what it is to have our hearts full of love, whether we preach or not, so that they may be a true expression of that grace which seeks men.<a name=257:5></a> Thus the power of God accompanied the disciples; they cast out devils and healed the sick.<a name=257:6></a>

		At this time the report of the works and power of the Lord reached the king's ears; his conscience was troubled at it because he put John the Baptist to death.<a name=257:7></a> Here begins the history of the facts which shew practically the opposition of man's heart to the testimony of God.<a name=257:8></a> The enmity against the truth and the light which was fulfilled in the death of Jesus, manifested itself already in the death of His predecessor.<a name=257:9></a> Herod's natural conscience had induced him to listen to John; the fear that he had of the holy man who had been faithful in rebuking him caused him to have some regard for him, and to keep him from the enmity of Herodias; but that which is natural is not enough to form a barrier to the flesh.<a name=257:10></a> The excitement of a banquet and royal pride are enough to cause the prophet's death.<a name=257:11></a> Painful instance of the manner in which man deceives himself; and when he imagines himself strong enough to shew forth his power, all he can do is to reveal his weakness and his slavery to his passions.<a name=257:12></a> All this does but accomplish the will of God; this enmity of man's heart must shew itself, and must introduce, by the rejection of John the Baptist and of Jesus Himself, things infinitely better, through the sovereign grace of God.<a name=257:13></a>

		The disciples come back and relate to Jesus all that they have done and taught; it was natural that they should be full of it.<a name=258:1></a> But the Saviour does not say anything about it; for Him power was a natural thing, and He wishes the disciples to come apart in a desert place to rest a little in solitude.<a name=258:2></a> It is always a good thing, even necessary for us whatever the blessing may be -- all the more the greater it is -- for us poor creatures who are so incapable of bearing the effect of power when the work is by our means, so ready are we to attribute it to ourselves without perceiving it; it is necessary, I say, to retire into God's presence, and there in His presence to find out what we are in truth, to enjoy in safety His perfect love: but to be occupied with Him and not with ourselves.<a name=258:3></a> This is what the Lord did in His tender consideration for His own.<a name=258:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the love of God does not find repose in this world; and man, finding but little love in human hearts, is afraid of wearying the Lord when He is present there; but divine love never refuses to attend to man's wants.<a name=258:5></a> The people recognised Jesus and ran together from every city, coming out of their solitude to see Jesus; and He, seeing this great multitude, was moved with compassion, because they were as sheep without a shepherd.<a name=258:6></a> He begins to teach them: this is the first and true need of the people abandoned of their human shepherds; but the Lord still thinks of all the needs of His hungry people.<a name=258:7></a> The disciples would have wished to have sent away the crowd, but Jesus wishes to feed it.<a name=258:8></a> This miracle has a great meaning in itself, from the place it holds in this Gospel.<a name=258:9></a> Jehovah was the true Shepherd of Israel and was there present in the person of Christ, who in truth was rejected.<a name=258:10></a> Nevertheless His compassion and His love were not weakened by the ingratitude of the people.<a name=258:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To shew that He is really Jehovah, He acts according to Psalm 132: 15; "I will satisfy her poor with bread.<a name=258:12></a>" This is a psalm which predicts the time of the Messiah, which will be fully accomplished in the latter days; but He who shall accomplish it was there present, and though He be rejected, He gives the proof that Jehovah has visited His people -- He satisfies the poor with bread.<a name=258:13></a> His love was far superior to the malice of His people.<a name=258:14></a> He had already said that the Son of man would be put to death, and that the people would not receive their Saviour-God.<a name=258:15></a> With all this, Jehovah does not abandon His love; if the people do not want Jehovah, Jehovah wants the people.<a name=258:16></a> He gives the precious testimony that Jehovah's love does not grow weary, but remains superior to all the folly of man.<a name=258:17></a> May His name be praised and adored for it!<a name=258:18></a> We can all the more count upon His unfailing goodness not to allow us to fall into negligence, but to sustain us in our weakness; for His love is greater than all our failings, so that we can adore His patience.<a name=258:19></a>

		But there is another important truth which we find here.<a name=259:1></a> The Lord does not say, "I will give them to eat," but, "Give them to eat.<a name=259:2></a>" The Lord wishes the disciples to know what it is to use His power for the good of others, and that they may know how to use it by faith.<a name=259:3></a> Oh, what a thought that true faith employs Jehovah's power, and in circumstances which shew that His love is above our unfaithfulness and failure!<a name=259:4></a> How important a truth for us, that Christ is the expression of this love, of the superiority of God's grace over all our sins; for "God commendeth his love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us.<a name=259:5></a>" This was the proof of it; but that which was manifested in His death is always true for us in His life.<a name=259:6></a> "Much more," says the apostle, "being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.<a name=259:7></a>" Faith, therefore, counts upon the unfailing faithfulness of this love, and uses the strength which is made perfect in weakness.<a name=259:8></a> The flesh in the disciples sees nothing but carnal means, and does not look at God's love and power but at that which is seen.<a name=259:9></a> But the Lord gives food in abundance to the hungry multitude, and shews Himself to be both the God and Saviour of Israel.<a name=259:10></a>

		The story which follows gives us the picture of the separation caused by the Lord's rejection, and the welcome which will be given to Him at the end of the history of this world which has rejected Him.<a name=259:11></a> He does not speak of the judgment of His adversaries, but of the change of the world itself.<a name=259:12></a> The Lord constrains His disciples to depart alone, whilst He sends away the multitude; and when they are gone, He departs into a mountain to pray.<a name=259:13></a> This is exactly what the Lord has now done: the disciples are tossed upon the tempestuous sea of the world; Jesus has sent away Israel, and has ascended to heaven to intercede for us.<a name=259:14></a> In the meantime the wind is contrary, and we toil in rowing with difficulty and trouble, being outwardly left to the Lord; but He intercedes for us always, and obtains mercy and grace for us in the time of need.<a name=259:15></a> Israel had been dismissed.<a name=259:16></a>

		More exactly, the disciples upon the sea represent the Jewish remnant, which in fact has become the church: but here it is considered in its character of the Jewish remnant.<a name=260:1></a> Jesus overtakes the ship, walking upon the sea, for He can walk calmly upon circumstances which cause us great trouble.<a name=260:2></a> The disciples are afraid, but Jesus comforts them, assuring them that it is Himself, their well-known friend and Saviour.<a name=260:3></a> Thus it will be at the end of the times: Jesus will appear superior to all the circumstances by which His people are troubled; and He will be the same meek and humble companion who walked upon earth with His disciples "in the days of his flesh.<a name=260:4></a>"

		CHAPTER 7
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This seventh chapter is full of the most interesting teaching.<a name=261:1></a> First, the Lord's judgment upon the outward piety of the heads of Judaism, which was altogether external and nothing less than hypocrisy, and which set aside the law of God.<a name=261:2></a> All these washings are despised by God; the Pharisees had set aside the commandment of God to keep their own tradition.<a name=261:3></a> Secondly, the Lord shews that that which comes out of a man's mouth defiles the man, because it arises from the heart; not that which enters into the man.<a name=261:4></a> Then having thus judged Israel and man, He shews forth in the most touching manner the sovereign grace of God which passes by every barrier to reach man's need: outside of all rights founded upon the promises, demanding only that the heart should recognise it in order that it may be entirely the pure grace of God in love which does the good; revealing itself as love when man is bad, and without any hope outside of this sovereign grace.<a name=261:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Outward things are easy to do; man likes to make his religion of them, for they do not need a pure heart; man likes to do them, and to exalt himself and to distinguish himself from others in doing them.<a name=261:6></a> By them man boasts of great piety before other men, and gains a great reputation for it; but he can be bad at the same time; these outward acts do not bring him into the presence of God who searches the heart.<a name=261:7></a> Man by these acts is religious without possessing holiness, and he finds that this just suits him.<a name=261:8></a> One does not find Pharisees only in our Lord's time; they are to be found in all times.<a name=261:9></a> This system always attaches itself to the influence which a man exerts over another by means of a position outwardly holy; it is not the faith which possesses truth and grace for itself (which truth and grace came by Jesus Christ, and which produce holiness and communion with God who reveals Himself in them), but the official influence that a man uses to his own advantage, carelessly leaving on one side the will and the commandments of God.<a name=261:10></a> Thus it was amongst the Jews; they washed their hands, but not their hearts; they were very scrupulous about that which entered their mouth, and careless about that which came out of their heart.<a name=261:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus is man's religion always; he can observe such a religion as this, and deck himself with it as with a glory.<a name=261:12></a> But he cannot get real holiness in this way, and this is evident to the eyes of God, who sees all that goes on in the heart.<a name=261:13></a> True holiness shews itself in the practical walk; one may fail, but the soul sustained by grace only seeks the approbation of God; it has the consciousness of failure, and rejoices in God, for it is He who dwells in the soul, and keeps it humble.<a name=261:14></a> But the Pharisees and Sadducees amongst the Jews profited by their reputation and position to induce the pious to give many gifts to God, whom they represented.<a name=261:15></a> Thus duties towards parents were slighted, and God's law countermanded.<a name=261:16></a> They honoured God with their lips, but their heart was far from Him.<a name=261:17></a> They drew near to Him with their mouth, but not with their heart; this was full of covetousness and iniquity.<a name=261:18></a> God refuses altogether this kind of honour.<a name=261:19></a> "In vain do they worship me," says the prophet Isaiah, and the Lord repeats it.<a name=261:20></a> God wants a pure heart sanctified by the Spirit and by the truth; and He wants a worship which is to be rendered in spirit and in truth: the Father seeketh such to worship Him.<a name=261:21></a> He wants grace, but the truth is required to be able to draw near to God, a heart where the divine life exists.<a name=261:22></a> All this human religion, outward, Pharisaical, priestly, is judged of the Lord once and for all times.<a name=261:23></a> God demands a pure heart and true obedience.<a name=261:24></a> Men put on this kind of religion, giving honour in it to antiquity and to the traditions of their ancestors, to which man's imagination attributes great value.<a name=261:25></a> All that is seen through the shades of antiquity is imposing enough; but with God it is a question of the heart, and it was the same then as it is now with us: we are before God, and He sees us just as we are.<a name=261:26></a> Man's actual state is the question.<a name=261:27></a>

		Observe also that, when practical holiness and obedience are no longer to be found in the life of the leaders, a religion founded by God becomes the power of sin and of hypocrisy, and tends always to pervert the mind, to destroy the conscience and uprightness in all; because that which is looked upon as God's authority encourages hypocrisy and iniquity, and also tends to produce unbelief, because men see that religion attaches itself to that which even the natural conscience condemns.<a name=263:10></a> Oh how sad a story is that of the human heart and of the church of God, such as men have made it!<a name=263:11></a> Observe also the influence of the corrupt religious authority to blind men and to destroy spiritual intelligence.<a name=263:12></a> What can be clearer than that which the Lord says?<a name=263:13></a> But the natural conscience does not recognise the truth that it is not that which entereth into a man's mouth that defileth the man, but that which comes out of it, for it proceeds from the heart.<a name=263:14></a> The thing is simple enough.<a name=263:15></a>

		The Lord's discourse which follows touches upon this in the question which He asks His disciples, "Whom do men say that I am?<a name=269:1></a>" And they answered, "John the Baptist; but some, Elias; and others one of the prophets": different opinions, but no faith.<a name=269:2></a> Then He asks them, "But whom say ye that I am?<a name=269:3></a>" Peter answers, "Thou art the Christ"; and the Lord forbids the disciples to tell it to any man, in the most positive manner.<a name=269:4></a> This is the clearest proof that the testimony in the midst of the people was entirely at an end.<a name=269:5></a> He was nevertheless the Christ, but He was rejected by the people, which shewed itself to be its own enemy in rejecting the wondrous grace of God.<a name=269:6></a> Now He begins to teach His disciples openly that He must suffer as Son of man: a much greater position and title, both as regards the extent of His power, and the greatness of the dominion which belonged to Him; for all things will be subjected to the sway of the Son of man.<a name=269:7></a> But in order that the Son of man might take His place in glory, He must first suffer, be put to death and rise again; it was necessary that redemption should be accomplished, and that man should enter into a new position, into an entirely new state, in which he had never been even when innocent.<a name=269:8></a> Christ's position as Messiah was now set aside for this time, and He enters into one greater where old things are left behind beyond death, and all that is founded upon Christ's work, upon His death -- enters upon a state altogether new and eternal.<a name=269:9></a>

		It was thus with poor Peter!<a name=272:6></a> It is true, he had not yet received the Holy Ghost, but this does not change the nature of his desires.<a name=272:7></a> He wished for this world's glory, and that under the appearance of love for the Lord.<a name=272:8></a> Notice here too the Lord's love for His disciples and how great is His tender care for them; He turns round and sees how great a stumbling-block Peter's words may be for the other disciples, and reproves him as severely as his words deserved.<a name=272:9></a> Then the Lord puts two principles before the disciples, first, the soul is worth more than everything, it is not to be exchanged for anything; secondly, the Lord is about to come in glory, and whosoever shall be ashamed of Him in this corrupt world where He is rejected, of him will the Son of man be ashamed when He shall come in the glory of His Father with the holy angels.<a name=272:10></a>

		CHAPTER 9
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the Lord finds the occasion to manifest this personal glory of His to establish the disciples' faith, and also to shew that His presence in grace as Messiah, in the midst of Israel, was soon to come to an end; and that the new glory of the Son of man with His own was soon to be inaugurated, although it would be necessary to await the time when all the co-heirs should be gathered together.<a name=273:1></a> "Verily I say unto you," says the Lord, "There be some of them that stand here which shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.<a name=273:2></a>" Six days afterwards the Lord went up into a mountain with Peter, James, and John, and was transfigured before them; His raiment became shining and exceeding white as snow; Elias and Moses appeared with Him glorified in like manner, speaking with Him.<a name=273:3></a> We know that this apparition was the manifestation of Christ's glorious reign over the earth.<a name=273:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We read in 2 Peter 1-16, "For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his Majesty.<a name=273:5></a> For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to Him from the excellent glory, 'This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased'; and this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with him in the holy mount.<a name=273:6></a>" These are the words of the apostle Peter when he relates that which happened to him when he saw the wonderful vision of the mountain of the transfiguration.<a name=273:7></a> From this we learn what the kingdom is as regards its manifestation upon earth, for they were upon earth.<a name=273:8></a> The bright cloud which covered them was the Father's dwelling-place, whence the voice came and into which, according to Luke, they had entered.<a name=273:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What a privilege for poor mortals, for sinners to have been able to gaze upon the Son of God in glory, and to have been manifested with Him in the same glory upon earth; to be His companions, to converse with Him; to possess the testimony that they have been loved as He has been loved (John 17: 23); to be with Him, and like Him in everything as Man, for His own glory; wonderful proof of the value of the redemption He has accomplished!<a name=273:10></a> And the nearer we shall be to Him, the more shall we adore Him, being with Him as <i>we shall</i> be in the Father's house.<a name=273:11></a> But here our evangelist does not speak of their entering; comparing however Luke 9 we find it nevertheless true that they entered into the cloud out of which came the Father's voice.<a name=273:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It was according to God's counsel that we should be with Christ, the second Man, the last Adam, and in the same glory with Him.<a name=274:1></a> We are predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son in order that He may be the first-born among many brethren.<a name=274:2></a> It is for this that He became man: He that sanctifieth and they that are sanctified are all of one, for which cause He is not ashamed to call us brethren.<a name=274:3></a> What would a Redeemer be without His redeemed?<a name=274:4></a> It is most certainly a far better thing to be a companion of the Lord Jesus in the Father's house, than co-heir of His glory before the world: yet both the one thing and the other are wonderful for poor creatures like ourselves.<a name=274:5></a> Elias and Moses are in the same glory; and we shall be like Him when He shall appear.<a name=274:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the Lord's personal glory is always maintained; Peter wishes to make three tabernacles, putting Christ, Moses, and Elias upon the same footing -- the three grand characters of Israel's history.<a name=274:7></a> But Moses and Elias disappear immediately, and the Father's voice recognises Jesus as His beloved Son; it is to Jesus' testimony that we must listen.<a name=274:8></a> All that Moses and Elias said is the truth, God's word, and by their means we learn God's thoughts; but they give testimony to Christ, not with Him.<a name=274:9></a> It is from Him alone that we learn fully the will of God, and His truth fully revealed.<a name=274:10></a> Jesus is the truth, and grace and truth came by Him.<a name=274:11></a> The death of Christ, His resurrection and completed redemption have put everything upon a new footing for men.<a name=274:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The believers who lived before the Lord's coming, believed in the promises and prophecies which announced His arrival; and they were accepted by faith; their sins committed during the time of God's patience, and which He bore with because He knew what He would do later on, are forgiven; and God's righteousness in forgiving them is manifested, now that Christ has died.<a name=274:13></a> But now God's righteousness is manifested, and the power of divine life is shewn forth in the resurrection of Jesus Christ.<a name=274:14></a> All is new in our relationship with God; the veil is rent, and we enter freely into the holiest.<a name=274:15></a> "The righteousness of God without law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets.<a name=274:16></a>" Behold Moses and Elias; but the glory in which both Moses and Elias appeared is the fruit, not of the law nor of the prophets, but of the work of Jesus Christ; and one can only possess it in the resurrection state.<a name=274:17></a> The Lord's resurrection too was absolutely necessary, as being the power of life beyond death, and as a proof that God had accepted the death of Christ as having answered to the question of sin.<a name=274:18></a> The glory belonged to another world, gained for those who believe by the sacrifice of Christ, the Son of God, although this had to be fulfilled in this world.<a name=274:19></a> It belongs, therefore, to the state into which Christ, the second Adam, has entered by resurrection, and is based upon accomplished redemption.<a name=274:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus, although this was well-suited to strengthen the faith and increase the intelligence of these three, columns of the future church, it was not to be talked about before the Lord's resurrection, and Jesus forbade the disciples to tell the things they had seen until the Son of man should be raised from among the dead.<a name=275:1></a> Notice the expression, "The disciples kept these words to themselves, asking one another what the rising from the dead should mean.<a name=275:2></a>" This indeed throws quite a new light upon the resurrection.<a name=275:3></a> Christ rose alone from amongst the dead, and left all the others in the grave; and His resurrection is a proof that the God of righteousness has accepted His work -- His sacrifice -- as a full and entire satisfaction given to His righteousness and His holiness; and the man who believes in Him is accepted according to the value of Christ's sacrifice.<a name=275:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The resurrection of the faithful also takes place, because God is fully satisfied as to them because of Christ's work.<a name=275:5></a> These alone will be raised when the Lord comes, to be for ever with Him.<a name=275:6></a> All the disciples believed in the resurrection of the dead, having been taught thus by the Pharisees; they were not like the Sadducees, but believed that all the Jews would be raised at once; and they did not understand the meaning of a resurrection which should separate the good from the bad, and should leave the latter behind for a certain time.<a name=275:7></a> Christ is the firstfruits of the resurrection of the saints, not of the wicked.<a name=275:8></a> Those who are Christ's shall rise at His coming, and their vile body shall be changed and made like unto His glorious body.<a name=275:9></a> There are many Christians who, like the disciples, do not understand the Lord's words.<a name=275:10></a> One finds many Christians who have a faith like that of the Pharisees; they believe indeed that there will be a resurrection.<a name=275:11></a> and, like Martha, that all will rise at the last day.<a name=275:12></a> The only difference is that Martha and the Jews believed in the resurrection of the Jews only; and these Christians believe in a resurrection where good and bad will be raised together.<a name=275:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is quite true that all will rise, but true faith in Christ (notice, dear reader), true faith makes the distinction already.<a name=276:1></a> The unbeliever remains in his sins, and will rise for the judgment, and the true believer will rise for the resurrection of life; he will rise (as we find in 1 Corinthians 15) in glory.<a name=276:2></a> When the Lord comes, He will change our vile body and fashion it like unto His glorious body.<a name=276:3></a> Christ is the first-fruits of the resurrection, but certainly not of the wicked: in no part of the word do we find a common resurrection of good and bad: we find in Luke 14: 14, a resurrection of the just, and again (20: 35), "they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from among the dead.<a name=276:4></a>" Thus we find expressly in 1 Corinthians 15, "Every man in his own order, Christ the first-fruits, afterwards they that are Christ's at his coming.<a name=276:5></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus also in 1 Thessalonians 4, "The dead in Christ shall rise first": it is always thus.<a name=276:6></a> People quote Matthew 25, but in that chapter it is no question of resurrection, nor of raised bodies; it is not a universal judgment, but a judgment of Gentiles upon the earth, of those to whom the everlasting gospel of Revelation 14 had been sent at the end of the age.<a name=276:7></a> There are not two classes only here, but three; the sheep, the goats, and the brethren of the Judge.<a name=276:8></a> The principle of the judgment here is not the principle of a universal judgment.<a name=276:9></a> It is just according to the manner in which they have received and esteemed the Judge's brethren; that is, the messengers of the everlasting gospel, called in Matthew 24: 14, "this gospel of the kingdom.<a name=276:10></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The principles of the general judgment of the nations are explained in Romans 1 and 2; these are quite different.<a name=276:11></a> I speak of Matthew 25 because it is the only passage that is quoted as a reply to the uniform testimony of the Holy Scriptures to a distinct resurrection of believers, according to the declaration of John 5: 24: "Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment; but is passed from death unto life.<a name=276:12></a>" We shall all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ, certainly, and every one will give account of himself to God.<a name=276:13></a> But when the believers shall stand before the judgment-seat of Christ, they will have been glorified already, raised in glory, and made like unto the glory of Christ, as man.<a name=276:14></a> "When he shall appear, we shall be like him" -- it is for this that "every one who hath this hope in him, purifieth himself, even as he is pure.<a name=276:15></a>"

		The first coming of Christ put away sin as regards judgment; for believers He will appear the second time unto perfect salvation to receive them to Himself, to glorify them.<a name=277:1></a> Their spirits are with Him in heaven, whilst they await this hour-the resurrection of their bodies will take place when He shall return, and then we shall all be for ever with the Lord.<a name=277:2></a> When glorified however, we shall give account of everything; we shall know as we have been known.<a name=277:3></a> There is thus a resurrection from among the dead.<a name=277:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The difficulty of which the scribes talked (that Elias ought to come before the Messiah) presents itself to the disciples.<a name=277:5></a> Now the scribes still exercised great influence over the disciples.<a name=277:6></a> And in truth, this is to be found in Malachi's prophecy; it will be surely fulfilled, whatever the manner of fulfilment may be, before the Lord's coming in glory.<a name=277:7></a> But He came first in humiliation, and hidden, as it were, as to His external glory; He entered by the door as the shepherd of the sheep, in order that faith seeing through the darkness of His position and of His daily life, might discern not merely a Messiah, come to Israel according to the promises, but the love and power of God Himself -- and might find itself in the presence of His holiness.<a name=277:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Jews would have received with joy a Messiah who should liberate them from the Roman yoke; but the presence of God is unsupportable for men, even when He appears amongst them in goodness.<a name=277:9></a> To the coming which is still future, the Lord alludes when He says in Matthew 10: 23, "For I tell you ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel until the Son of man be come.<a name=277:10></a>" But now He appears in humility, made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death; that is, in order to be able to suffer.<a name=277:11></a> Thus also John the Baptist comes in the spirit and power of Elias, according to Isaiah 11 and Malachi 3, to prepare the way of the Lord.<a name=277:12></a> Thus the Lord answers; John must come; the scribes are right; John shall come and restore all things.<a name=277:13></a> But it was necessary too that the Son of man should suffer, and that He should be thoroughly despised.<a name=277:14></a> "But I tell you that Elias hath already come, and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed.<a name=277:15></a>"

		But if the Lord was manifested in His glory before the disciples' eyes in the transfiguration, He occupies Himself now with the misery of the earth; and that which took place is very remarkable for the display of His patience, and of the ways of God.<a name=278:1></a> When He comes down from the mountain, He finds a great crowd, and the scribes reasoning with His disciples.<a name=278:2></a> It is blessed to notice that if the Lord is recognised as Son of God, and will be manifested in glory, and we with Him, He nevertheless comes down into this world -- as He does still by His Spirit -- and meets with the crowd and the power of Satan for us; and again (it is well for us to notice it) He speaks as intimately with His disciples as He does with Moses and Elias.<a name=278:3></a> Oh, how great is His grace!<a name=278:4></a> But the exercise of this grace develops the position and state of man and of the disciples.<a name=278:5></a>

		A poor father has recourse to the Lord for his suffering son, who is possessed of an evil spirit, and cannot speak.<a name=278:6></a> He tells the Lord that he had brought him to the disciples, and that they could not cast out the unclean spirit.<a name=278:7></a> This is their position; not only does the Lord encounter unbelief, but although divine power be in the earth, believers even do not know how to use it; it was in vain then that the Lord was present in the world.<a name=278:8></a> He could work miracles, but man did not know how to profit by this, or to use it by faith.<a name=278:9></a> It was a faithless generation; and He could not stay down here.<a name=278:10></a> It was not the presence or the power of the devils that drove Him away, for indeed it was this that brought Him down here; but when His own do not know how to profit by the power and the blessing which He has brought into the world and placed in their midst, the dispensation characterised by these gifts must be drawing to its close.<a name=278:11></a> And this, not because there is unbelief in the world, but because He own cannot realise the power placed at their disposal; and in consequence the testimony of God falls to the ground destroyed, instead of being established; since the followers of this testimony meet with the power of the enemy and cannot do anything -- the enemy is too strong for them.<a name=278:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"O faithless generation," says the Lord, "how long shall I be with you?<a name=278:13></a> How long shall I suffer you?<a name=278:14></a>" His service upon earth was finished.<a name=278:15></a> But see the patience and goodness of the Lord; He cannot deny Himself.<a name=278:16></a> All the time He is down here upon earth He works according to His power and grace, and that notwithstanding the unbelief of His own.<a name=278:17></a> He finishes the sentence in which He reproves their unbelief in this manner -- "Bring him to me.<a name=278:18></a>" Faith, however small it be, is never left without an answer from the Lord.<a name=278:19></a> What a consolation!<a name=278:20></a> whatever be the unbelief, not only of the world, but of Christians -- if only one solitary person were left in the world who had faith in the goodness and power of the Lord Jesus, he could not come to Him with a real need and simple belief without finding His heart ready and His power sufficient.<a name=278:21></a>

		The church may be in ruins, as was Israel, but the Head is sufficient for everything, knows the state of His own, and will not fail to supply their needs.<a name=278:22></a> The child's state was very dangerous, and the devil had possessed him from his infancy.<a name=278:23></a> The father's faith was feeble, but sincere; he says to the Lord, "If thou canst do anything, have pity upon us, and help us.<a name=278:24></a>" The Lord's reply is remarkable: "If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.<a name=278:25></a>" Power connects itself with faith; the difficulty is not in Christ's power, but in man's believing; all things were possible if he could believe.<a name=278:26></a> This is an important principle; Christ's power never fails to accomplish all that is good for man; faith, alas!<a name=278:27></a> may be wanting in us to profit by it.<a name=278:28></a> However the Lord is full of goodness; the poor father says with tears, "I believe, help thou mine unbelief": sincere words from a moved heart in which the Lord had already awakened faith.<a name=278:29></a> It was the anxiety for his son that weakened this faith.<a name=278:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the Lord, avoiding the empty curiosity of the people, thinking rather of the needs of the father and son, commands the unclean spirit with authority to come out and not to enter again into the child.<a name=278:31></a> And he comes out of him, shewing at she same time his power (tearing the child, so as to leave him as dead), but absolutely subject to the Lord's authority.<a name=278:32></a> It is very beautiful to see that the Lord upon leaving the glory went to meet the unbelief of the world and of His own, and the weakness of the faith of those who have need of it, and that too in the presence of the enemy's great power.<a name=278:33></a> The Lord does not keep at a distance from us, He takes part in our sorrows, He encourages our weak faith, and with a single word drives away all the power of the enemy.<a name=278:34></a> Neither His own glorious state, nor the unbelief of the world which rejected Him, prevented Him from being the refuge and the remedy for the poorest faith.<a name=278:35></a> He interests Himself in us, thinks of us, and helps us.<a name=278:36></a>

		Now that the future glory, the glory of the kingdom, has been revealed; -- now that the Lord has shewn forth His power and His perfect goodness in spite of the unbelief of the world, and of His departure after having been rejected by the world -- He takes His disciples aside, passing through Galilee to make them understand that the Son of man would be given into the hands of men who would put Him to death.<a name=280:6></a> He speaks of His title as Son of man, because He could not any longer remain upon earth as the promised Messiah, but He must accomplish the work of redemption.<a name=280:7></a> However after that He should have been put to death, He would rise again on the third day.<a name=280:8></a> Behold then redemption completed and everything made new: man is put upon an entirely new footing, at least the believer in Jesus.<a name=280:9></a>

		The Lord, having the consciousness of His glory in which the Father had recognised Him a little while ago as His beloved Son, and knowing at the same time that this glory made the cross absolutely necessary to bring many sons to glory, speaks of it to His disciples; He insists that it will be necessary for them to carry it.<a name=281:13></a> Such was the path of the glory of which His own death was the foundation.<a name=281:14></a> The Lord's heart was full of the thought of the sufferings which accompanied it; of the cup He had to drink, and of the necessity of His disciples' understanding this path, and of taking up their cross.<a name=281:15></a> But of what were the disciples' hearts full?<a name=281:16></a> They were thinking who should be the greatest.<a name=281:17></a> Alas, how incapable our heart is to receive God's thoughts, to think of a Saviour humbled unto death for us!<a name=281:18></a> It is true that the Spirit of God puts in contrast here the reign of Messiah which the Jews expected, and the glorious heavenly reign which the Lord was establishing, and for which His death was necessary; but the contrast comes out strongly thus in the heart of man.<a name=281:19></a> He would like to be great in a kingdom established according to man's glory and man's power; he esteems it a good thing that God should condescend to this; but that His glory should be morally exalted and established, and the vain glory of man brought to nought, the manifestation of what man is; the love, holiness, and justice of God brought to light -- all this is what man neither seeks nor desires; and when the Lord's heart, full of these solemn truths and of the sufferings by which He must needs pass to fulfil them, speaks of them to His disciples, the latter dispute as to who shall be greatest.<a name=281:20></a> How poor and wretched a thing is man's heart!<a name=281:21></a>

		What incapacity to understand God's thoughts, and to feel the tenderness and faithfulness of the heart of Jesus, and the thoughts passing through it; divine love manifesting itself in the heart of a Man, and as a Man in the midst of men, in which is found a moral incapacity to enter into His thoughts; but this opens the way at the same time to the manifestation of our thoughts which are in full contrast with those of Jesus.<a name=282:1></a> May God grant us in His grace to hold the flesh so entirely subject, that the Holy Spirit may be the source of all our thoughts and of the movements of our hearts.<a name=282:2></a> Nevertheless the conscience does not keep silence if the Lord's word touches us: we know well that the desire of vain glory is a bad thing, that it is not meet for Christ, for Him who speaks, and we are ashamed.<a name=282:3></a> The disciples are silent because their conscience speaks.<a name=282:4></a>

		Now the patient love of the Lord sets itself to teach them; He sits down (verse 35), and calls the twelve: He always thinks of us.<a name=283:1></a> He then teaches several principles, in which we see the consequences of the world's opposition to Christ, and the introduction of a new relationship with God in Christ risen; these principles demand some explanation.<a name=283:2></a> The important point here, the foundation of all the Lord's exhortations, and of all He says is this, that the glory of the kingdom to come has been revealed, and with this revelation comes the cross.<a name=283:3></a> It is the end of all the relationships between God and Israel, and indeed between God and man, except indeed that of sovereign grace, and the principle of a new and heavenly relationship by faith.<a name=283:4></a> But Christ, the Messiah according to the promises in Israel, God manifest in flesh, the last hope for man as he was upon earth, was rejected.<a name=283:5></a> The relationship between God and man was broken.<a name=283:6></a> Could one seek glory upon an earth of this kind?<a name=283:7></a> What kind of disposition is fitting for a disciple of Christ?<a name=283:8></a> Humility: he who would be first shall be the last and servant of all.<a name=283:9></a> Then He takes a child and declares that he who receives such an one in His name receives Christ; and he who receives Christ receives the Father who sent Him.<a name=283:10></a> The name of Christ is the touch-stone, the only thing upon earth really great by faith.<a name=283:11></a>

		Then we find a reproof for a thing which in itself was love, though rough and coarse, but which dresses itself in very deceitful forms, and seems to consider Christ's glory; for love in itself is not upright: it is quite disposed to maintain the glory of Christ's name, if it can attach itself to this glory.<a name=283:12></a> "We saw one casting out devils in thy name, and he followeth not us, and we forbade him because he followeth not us.<a name=283:13></a>" See here the word "us" betrays the most subtle love of self: subtle, it is true, but none the less dangerous.<a name=283:14></a> But the Lord's answer shews how absolute is His rejection: "He who is not against us is on our part," because the whole world in its natural state was against Christ, and is still against Him; and no one could perform miracles in His name and at the same time speak evil or lightly of Him.<a name=283:15></a> The name of Christ is everything.<a name=283:16></a> Let us avoid this wretched "us," and hold fast to Christ.<a name=283:17></a>

		However much it may cost us, if it should be an eye that offends us, we must pluck it out; if a hand, we must cut it off; in a word, the most valuable thing possible; for an eternity of blessing with Christ is better than to keep a right hand and to find oneself in eternal torments, "where their worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched.<a name=284:10></a>" Besides this, God puts all to the proof: the fire of His judgment is applied to all, both to saints and sinners.<a name=284:11></a> In the saints, it consumes the dross, in order that the pure gold may shine in its true lustre; in the case of sinners, the fire of God and the eternal pains according to His just judgment, fire that is not quenched.<a name=284:12></a> "Every sacrifice must be salted with salt"; this refers to Leviticus 2: 13.<a name=284:13></a> The salt represents the power of the Holy Spirit, not exactly to produce grace alone, but to keep us from all that is impure, and to produce holiness in a heart devoted to God, and which introduces God into its path; and in the heart there is a link with Himself which keeps us from all corruption.<a name=284:14></a> We are called to keep this in the heart, and to apply the sense of His presence to all that passes within us, and to judge by this means all that is within us.<a name=284:15></a>

		We have already seen that the Lord assumes here the title of Son of David, a name which spoke of the accomplishment of the promises and constituted Him true king of Israel.<a name=295:1></a> The name which He took habitually and by preference was that of Son of man.<a name=295:2></a> This name had a much wider signification and announced the right to a power and a lordship much more extensive than those of the Son of David; it put Christ into strict relationship with all men, but asserted His right to all the glory that belonged to the Son of man according to the counsels of God.<a name=295:3></a> In Psalm 2 we find the two titles, of the Son of God -- the one which was given to Jesus as born down here in this world, and that of King of Israel, though in rejection.<a name=295:4></a> Then in Psalm 8 (after shewing forth the state of His people in Psalms 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) we see His glory, the extent of His power, as Son of man, who is set over all things.<a name=295:5></a> In Daniel 7 we find again the Son of man brought before the Ancient of Days, from whose hand He receives dominion over all nations.<a name=295:6></a>
	</div>

		In chapters 11 and 12 of the Gospel by John, Christ being rejected by man, God wills that a full testimony should be rendered to Him in the three characters of Son of God, Son of David, and Son of man.<a name=295:7></a> The first is the resurrection of Lazarus; the second at the entry into Jerusalem, seated upon the ass; the third when the Greeks come to ask to see Jesus: then the Lord says, "The hour is come that the Son of man should be glorified.<a name=295:8></a> Verily, verily, I say unto you, except a grain of wheat fallen into the ground die, it abideth alone; but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.<a name=295:9></a>" In order to take possession of these titles, He must have His co-heirs with Him; -- He must die.<a name=295:10></a>

		In our chapter He takes the second title, and presents Himself to the Jewish nation for the last time upon earth according to the prophecy of Zechariah.<a name=296:1></a> He will present Himself later in the glory and take possession of the throne of His father David; but now all He does is to present Himself to His people as the One who fulfils all the promises made to them.<a name=296:2></a> He knew well what would be the result, and that He was about to take the larger title of Son of man; and this in order to have His co-heirs with Himself; when, according to His Father's counsels, He should take His great power and reign.<a name=296:3></a> But it was necessary that this last testimony should be rendered to the people on the one hand, and to the Lord on the other, on God's part; that is, by the mouth of little children and sucklings He would take His glory, anticipating thus the establishment of the kingdom in power.<a name=296:4></a>

		There the crowd used the verse which announced the recognition of the Son of David by the remnant of the people Israel: "Hosannah!<a name=297:1></a>" (a Hebrew word meaning "Save now!<a name=297:2></a>" which becomes a kind of <i>formula</i> for asking the Lord's help when the true Christ or Messiah is recognised), "Hosannah to the Son of David: blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; hosannah in the highest.<a name=297:3></a>" Now this cry recognised Jesus as the Son of David, the Messiah.<a name=297:4></a> Such was the will of God; that His Son should not be left without this testimony, without being honoured in this manner.<a name=297:5></a> Now He acts in Jerusalem according to this position.<a name=297:6></a>

Consequently, when we present ourselves in faith to ask for the fulfilment of our desire we must forgive our brother that which we may have against him; otherwise, we are in God's presence as regards His government and thus subject to the effect of our sins."

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us go back to the history of the Lord's life, and to the last days of this blessed life.<a name=314:1></a> Two days after was the passover, and the chiefs of the Jews sought to kill Him; nevertheless they feared to stir up a tumult amongst the people, because they felt that His doctrine and miracles had produced a powerful effect in their hearts; they said, "Not on the feast day, lest there be a tumult among the people.<a name=314:2></a>" This was their opinion, but not God's.<a name=314:3></a> The Lord must die as a true paschal lamb slain for us.<a name=314:4></a> Besides, He must die the very day of the passover, to surpass the sacrifice of the law, which commemorated the deliverance from Egypt, and which prefigured an infinitely more precious deliverance; that is, the deliverance from guilt before God, and from the dominion of sin.<a name=314:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Saviour's death drew near, and feelings of affection and of iniquity developed themselves on one side and the other.<a name=314:6></a> Here we see Mary, who used to sit at Jesus' feet to listen to Him and to understand His words.<a name=314:7></a> There her heart had drunk in the instruction which flowed from Jesus' heart; and Jesus, the source of all blessings, was the object which had fixed her heart, and she had felt it in her affections.<a name=314:8></a> The grace and love of Jesus had produced love for Him, and His word had produced spiritual intelligence.<a name=314:9></a> Now this love for the Saviour made her sensible of the increasing hatred of the Jews.<a name=314:10></a> The disciples knew that these sought to kill Him, but Mary felt it; not that she was a prophetess, but her heart felt the presentiment of that which man's hatred desired, and she did what she could as a witness of her contrary sentiment; and the Lord makes this act of love speak wherever the gospel is announced in the world.<a name=314:11></a>

		It is sweet to enter into the house where this family dwelt (here this was done in the house of Simon the leper), this family beloved of the Lord, for it was the refuge of His heart when, rejected by the people, He could no longer recognise the city which He had loved so long: He was accustomed to live with this beloved family.<a name=314:12></a> Martha, who seems to have been the eldest of the sisters, occupied with much serving, faithful and beloved of the Lord, but not very spiritually-minded, understood but little of that which filled His heart.<a name=314:13></a> Mary used to sit at His feet to hear His teaching; and the Lord had raised from the dead their brother Lazarus.<a name=314:14></a> Thus Mary's heart attached itself to the Lord, and became the expression of the little remnant which, united to Jesus Himself, followed the progress of God's ways; it did not stop at the hopes or thoughts of the Jews, but although the intelligence which the Holy Spirit would give was still wanting, it followed the Lord closely, and thus was ready to receive all when the revelation should be made.<a name=314:15></a>

		But the Lord must suffer all these sorrows -- He does not proudly hide them, but desires to lay His sorrows as a Man in human hearts; love counts upon love.<a name=317:1></a> There were sorrows which could not be poured into the hearts of men, and nevertheless it was God's will (blessed be His name for ever!<a name=317:2></a>) that we should know the sufferings of His Son; which, although beyond our reach, are nevertheless presented to our hearts.<a name=317:3></a> Thus we hear the Lord crying, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?<a name=317:4></a>" And if we cannot reach the depths of His sufferings, we can understand that they were infinite.<a name=317:5></a> Now at the table the Lord announces to them His departure from the world according to the scriptures and the terrible judgment of Judas; for the accomplishment of God's counsels does not take away the iniquity of those who fulfil them; otherwise how could God judge the world?<a name=317:6></a> For all work together to accomplish His counsels.<a name=317:7></a> Men's evil will too is always active in doing evil.<a name=317:8></a> The Lord's object, as we find written in this gospel, is not to point out the person who should commit the crime, but to make them feel that it was one of the twelve who should do it.<a name=317:9></a>

		Verse 22.<a name=317:10></a> Now the Lord institutes the supper, a precious sign and memorial of His love and of His death.<a name=317:11></a> Up to that time, the passover had been the commemoration of the deliverance of the people out of the captivity in Egypt, when the blood of the Lamb was put upon the doors of the houses where the Israelites were.<a name=317:12></a> Now the blood of a more excellent Lamb has been sprinkled upon the mercy-seat in heaven, before the eye of God; when Christ, the Lamb of God, accomplished everything for the glory of God and for the salvation of all believers.<a name=317:13></a> The work has been done: in the sacrifice of the cross Jesus drank the cup of malediction and cannot drink it again; He perfectly glorified God about sin; it is impossible to add anything, as though anything were wanting to complete the perfection of this work.<a name=317:14></a> He has borne the sins of many, and can never bear them again; He cannot offer Himself again, He is for ever seated at the right hand of God; Hebrews 9: 24-26.<a name=317:15></a> He would have had to suffer often, if His one offering upon the cross had not taken away for ever all the sins of all believers; without shedding of blood there is no remission.<a name=317:16></a>

		The forgiveness of sins for believers is full, perfect, and eternal through the work of Christ.<a name=317:17></a> If we sin after having received the forgiveness of our sins, Christ prays for us and is our Advocate in virtue of this propitiation and appears in God's presence for us, as our righteousness (1 John 2: 1, 2); and the effect of His intercession for us, is that the Holy Ghost works in our hearts; we are humbled, we confess our faults to God, and our communion is re-established with the Father and the Son.<a name=317:18></a> But the sin is not imputed as a crime, for Christ has already borne it -- it has been imputed to Him.<a name=317:19></a> As was the case in the passover in Egypt; God said, "When I see the blood, I will pass over you.<a name=317:20></a>" The blood of Christ is ever before the eye of God, ever present to His memory.<a name=317:21></a> Thus Christ washes our feet with the water of the word, as He has saved us by His blood, when by grace we have believed.<a name=317:22></a> But if God does not ever forget the blood of Christ shed once for ever, He does not wish us to forget it.<a name=317:23></a> The Lord Jesus in His boundless grace wishes us to think of Him, to remember Him.<a name=317:24></a> Precious manifestation of love for us, that the Saviour should delight in our remembrance of Him, and that He has left us a touching memorial of Himself and His love.<a name=317:25></a> Oh, happy thought that Jesus wishes us to think of Him, because He loves us!<a name=317:26></a> The sacrifice cannot be repeated, but its value is ever the same before God; and Jesus is seated at God's right hand awaiting the time when His enemies shall be set as a footstool beneath His feet; and we await Him until He come to take us with Him to the Father's house; and in the supper we shew forth His death till He comes.<a name=317:27></a>

		It is important to remark that there is no sacrifice in the present time, and that the Lord is not personally present in the bread and wine.<a name=318:1></a> The church of Rome says that the Lord's supper (or rather the mass, as they call it) is the same sacrifice as that which was accomplished upon the cross.<a name=318:2></a> But when the Lord said, "This is my body .<a name=318:3></a>.<a name=318:4></a>.<a name=318:5></a> do this in remembrance of me," He was not yet upon the cross.<a name=318:6></a> His blood was not yet shed, and when He broke the bread He did not hold Himself in His hands, still less Himself crucified, for He was not yet upon the cross.<a name=318:7></a> There is no such thing now as a crucified Christ; He is seated at God's right hand, and there is no shedding of blood now.<a name=318:8></a> It is a blessed fact that there is a sign, a commemoration of this, but that it should be so really and substantially is impossible; there is no such thing now as a dead Christ.<a name=318:9></a>

		We shew forth in the supper His death and His blood shed for us: but a glorified Christ cannot be a sacrifice; cannot come down from heaven to die; and if the bread be changed into His body, and there be a soul in it, it must be another soul; this is absurd.<a name=319:1></a> They say that the Godhead is everywhere, and that the substance of the body is there; but the soul is individual: this lives, feels, loves, is a single individual soul.<a name=319:2></a> According to Romish teaching the soul of the Lord Jesus leaves heaven; but it cannot be the same soul, and if it is another, it is absurd.<a name=319:3></a> The Lord says in Luke, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood": -- that is, it represents the blood -- for the cup itself is not the new covenant.<a name=319:4></a> Thus the bread presents to us in the most striking way the body of the Lord crucified upon the cross, and the wine His blood shed for us.<a name=319:5></a>

		Lastly, the Lord gives to His disciples of the fruit of the vine to drink; and it is called this after that the Lord had said in verse 24, "This is my blood of the new covenant.<a name=319:6></a>" It is quite clear that when he says, "I will drink no more of it," He speaks of wine in its natural sense.<a name=319:7></a> After Supper they sing a hymn, the Lord being perfectly calm in spirit.<a name=319:8></a> They go out to go to the Mount of Olives.<a name=319:9></a> The Lord warns His disciples that this night they shall all be offended because of Him, and that they would leave Him according to Zechariah's prophecy, "I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.<a name=319:10></a>" But He announces to them His resurrection, and that "after he is risen, he will go before them into Galilee.<a name=319:11></a>" We find a difference between the Lord's appearing in Galilee and in Bethany: the latter is related in Luke's gospel.<a name=319:12></a> It was from Bethany that He ascended to heaven.<a name=319:13></a> In Galilee the Lord is always looked upon as being on the earth, although risen from the dead; and He gives to His disciples the commission to preach the gospel to, and baptize all nations.<a name=319:14></a> This service was not accomplished by the apostles -- later on they left it to Paul (that is, the preaching the gospel to the nations) having recognised the Lord's election and sending out for this work.<a name=319:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We see that the commission in Mark is still different; it is connected with the Lord's heavenly power.<a name=319:16></a> The Lord's own work was done chiefly in Galilee; and the Jewish remnant is recognised as gathered together and accepted; then it is sent out to bring the Gentiles into the blessings which were expected from God.<a name=319:17></a> The announcing of heavenly blessings, salvation revealed by the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven when Christ ascended there, is quite another thing.<a name=319:18></a> But whether the blessings be earthly or heavenly they cannot be brought in by the first man; the second Man is the only possible foundation of everything.<a name=319:19></a>

		Now the Saviour must be quite alone in His work and sufferings, and man must shew what he is when he is not kept by God.<a name=320:1></a> The disciples were warned, but Peter, full of confidence in his faithfulness (and he was sincere), trusting to his own strength, would not believe the Lord's words.<a name=320:2></a> But the flesh cannot resist the power of Satan.<a name=320:3></a> The Lord would find Himself abandoned and denied; and man, however sincere he might be, would have to recognise his utter weakness: a humbling lesson, but a very useful one, and one which makes the Lord's grace and patience shine out.<a name=320:4></a> It is very important to recollect -- and we learn it clearly here, that sincerity is not enough to keep us right; it is quite a human quality!<a name=320:5></a> and we need as well the Lord's strength against the wiles of the devil, and the fear of the world.<a name=320:6></a> If the Lord be not there, a young girl can upset an apostle.<a name=320:7></a> The fear of man is a dreadful snare for the soul; and this fear worked mightily in Peter's heart.<a name=320:8></a> Even when he had received the Holy Spirit, he dissembled at Antioch, when some Jewish believers had come from Jerusalem.<a name=320:9></a>

		Remark how the Lord prepared the two greatest apostles for His work!<a name=320:10></a> Paul tried to destroy the name of Christ from off the earth, and Peter denied Him openly after having known Him, and after having done miracles in His name.<a name=320:11></a> Thus it was not possible for them to talk of anything but grace: and all the false confidence in self was destroyed in their hearts.<a name=320:12></a> They could strengthen others by the consciousness of the Lord's grace which had borne with them and forgiven them; also they had learnt by experience what the evil of the human heart is, and how weak man is, even the Christian, without the help of divine grace.<a name=320:13></a> Thus the Lord says to Peter, "When thou art converted [that is, repented of thy fault], strengthen thy brethren.<a name=320:14></a>" He failed again afterwards in such a manner that Paul had to resist him to the face; and Paul himself had to have a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan, to buffet him, lest he should be exalted.<a name=320:15></a> The flesh is never improved: how necessary then is it for weak Christians to watch, to have ever present the consciousness of their weakness, and to seek that strength which is made perfect in weakness, that precious grace of the Lord which is sufficient for us.<a name=320:16></a> It is not necessary that we should fall, for God is faithful and will not allow us to be tempted above that we are able; but we must watch, that we enter not into temptation.<a name=320:17></a>

		Remark with what gentle words the Lord reproves His disciples.<a name=323:1></a> He shews Peter in the kindest way the difference between fervent courage when the enemy was not present, and the incapacity to watch one hour with his agonized Master; and He excuses the disciples with loving words -- "the spirit is ready but the flesh is weak.<a name=323:2></a>" At the same time being full of the solemnity of the moment, He warns them also to watch and to pray lest they enter into temptation.<a name=323:3></a> We never find the Lord's own sufferings preventing Him from thinking of others.<a name=323:4></a> On the cross He can think of the thief, just as though He were not suffering Himself: If He had not time to eat, still He always had time enough to announce the truth to the crowd which followed Him; tired at Jacob's well, His heart does not grow weary of speaking of the living water, nor of looking into the poor Samaritan woman's conscience.<a name=323:5></a> He was never tired of doing good; and He is the same yesterday, today, and for ever.<a name=323:6></a>

		CHAPTER 15
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Gospel by Mark relates very briefly the circumstances of the Lord's condemnation: this is an important fact.<a name=327:1></a> As soon as He has been rejected by the Jews, Mark speaks of that which took place before Pilate, to relate again that which is necessary, and to shew that the Lord is condemned here too for the testimony which He bore Himself to the truth (although it was really through the malice of the principal Jews); for indeed Pilate strove to set Him at liberty, but having no moral strength, and despising the Jews and all that belonged to them, he gives the Lord up to their will without conscience.<a name=327:2></a> When Pilate asks, "Art thou the king of the Jews?<a name=327:3></a>" Jesus answers, "Thou sayest.<a name=327:4></a>" To the accusations of the chief priests, He answers nothing: His testimony had been given.<a name=327:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord Jesus was soon to be a victim.<a name=327:6></a> All these accusations were nothing, and Pilate knew it; but the Jews must manifest the spirit which animated them.<a name=327:7></a> Pilate tried to get rid of Jesus and of the difficulty, by a custom which seems to have been introduced at that time, to set free a prisoner at the Passover, to please the Jews.<a name=327:8></a> He also sought, in making this appeal to the people, to ward off the blow of envy and malice of the priests: but in vain, for the Lord must suffer and die.<a name=327:9></a> The priests incited the people to ask that Barabbas should be released, and the Lord crucified.<a name=327:10></a> Pilate tries again to save Him, but to satisfy the people he gives Him up.<a name=327:11></a>

		In all this the Jews are guilty; of course the Roman governor ought to have been firm, and to have acted justly, and not to have left the Lord exposed to the priests' hatred; he was careless and without conscience, and despised a poor Jew who had no friends; also it was important for him to satisfy the turbulent populace.<a name=327:12></a> In Mark's Gospel however, all the hatred and animosity against the Lord are found in the priests; they are always and everywhere the enemies of the truth and of Him who is Himself the truth personally.<a name=327:13></a> Pilate's resistance had no effect; it was God's will that Jesus should suffer: He had come for this, and it was for this that He gave His life a ransom for many.<a name=327:14></a> In that which follows we find the story of the brutality of the heart of man which finds its pleasure in outraging those who are given up to its will without being able to defend themselves.<a name=327:15></a> Besides, the Lord must be despised and rejected of men, both by the Jews and Gentiles.<a name=327:16></a> This proves that man would not have God in His goodness.<a name=327:17></a>

		Up to verse 33 we see the Lord's humiliation and the apparent triumph of evil.<a name=328:7></a> Man generally, and Israel as a nation, shew their joy in being able to get rid of God's faithful witness, of His presence, and of the true King of Israel: but they lowered themselves in trying to degrade the Lord, whose love continued to accomplish the work which the Father had given Him to do, in the midst of the outrages, the blindness, the folly, and the wickedness of men and of His people Israel, which alas!<a name=328:8></a> filled up the measure of its iniquity.<a name=328:9></a> The Saviour's love was stronger than man's perverse hatred -- blessed be His name for it!<a name=328:10></a> But from verse 33 we find a deeper work than the Lord's outward sufferings, however real and profound they were to Him.<a name=328:11></a> He was left alone; there was no one to have compassion upon Him; we find nothing but desertion and cruelty.<a name=328:12></a> But there is a great difference between the cruelty of man, and the penalty of sin executed by God.<a name=328:13></a>

		At the same hour all the country (or perhaps the earth) is covered with darkness.<a name=328:14></a> Christ is alone with God, hidden from things visible, in order to be entirely with God.<a name=328:15></a> He bears the penalty of our sin, He drinks the cup of malediction for us; He who knew no sin is made sin for us.<a name=328:16></a> In Psalm 22 we see that the Lord, feeling fully the pressure of man's hatred and malice, turns to God; He had foreseen what was to happen, and His sweat had become, as it were, drops of blood in thinking of it.<a name=328:17></a> He turns to God and says, "Be not thou far from me!<a name=328:18></a>" but to the anguish of His soul He is forsaken of God.<a name=328:19></a> And never was He more precious to God -- He who was eternally precious to Him -- than in His perfect obedience!<a name=328:20></a> But this obedience was fulfilled in His being made sin for us.<a name=328:21></a> Never had He so glorified His Father in His righteousness and love; but being made a sin-offering, and feeling in the depth of His soul that which God is against sin, He bore the penalty of it.<a name=328:22></a>

		Mark only speaks of Mary Magdalene's first visit to the sepulchre in verse 9; in verse 2, the other Mary and Salome are spoken of.<a name=332:5></a> Mary Magdalene had already gone away from the sepulchre to announce to Peter and John the fact of the sepulchre's being empty.<a name=332:6></a> These enter into the sepulchre, finding the stone rolled away from its mouth; they find an angel seated on the right hand of the place where Jesus lay, who encourages these timid but faithful women, "Fear not, ye seek Jesus .<a name=332:7></a>.<a name=332:8></a>.<a name=332:9></a> he is not here .<a name=332:10></a>.<a name=332:11></a>.<a name=332:12></a> " and then he shews them the place where He had been.<a name=332:13></a> It is blessed to see the goodness of God: there was still some unbelief in the women, for they ought to have understood that Jesus was risen; the angel had told them so.<a name=332:14></a> But this was too much for their faith; they believed in His person, and that He was the Son of God, but His resurrection was as yet too glorious a truth for their faith.<a name=332:15></a> Their heart was sincere, but they sought the living amongst the dead: and here the grace of God, full of compassion, reassures them.<a name=332:16></a>

		COMPARED VIEW OF THE FIRST THREE GOSPELS, ETC. -- PART 1
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I apprehend that the Gospel of Mark, which brings under our view the service of Christ, and particularly His prophetic service, and, hence, records simply the accomplishment of that service, as the events arose, is that of the three first Gospels, which gives generally the chronological order of events.<a name=334:1></a> Luke places, in general, events in the same order as Mark, where he follows chronological order at all.<a name=334:2></a> In a large portion of his Gospel he drops the chronological order, and gives a general series of instructions, of which the occasions and elements are found scattered in the other two Gospels, or are found only in Luke.<a name=334:3></a> I take Mark, therefore, as presenting, in the main, the historical order.<a name=334:4></a> It is to be remarked, that, as is stated in the end of John, very few of the events or miracles of our Lord's life are recorded: only such as shew forth His ministry, and specially in the earlier part in Galilee, and then at the close of Jerusalem.<a name=334:5></a> In these the Gospels, in the main, go together.<a name=334:6></a> Luke has a large portion of the middle part of his Gospel occupied with general moral teaching.<a name=334:7></a> But the way in which this comes in is not difficult to perceive, as in chapter 9 it is said that the time was come for Christ's receiving up.<a name=334:8></a> In all the Gospels the common history of the concluding events begins with the healing of the blind man near Jericho.<a name=334:9></a> In Matthew the method pursued by the evangelist is very evident; and the displacement of subjects, where they are found, is connected with that method.<a name=334:10></a> I will begin with him.<a name=334:11></a> The birth of Christ itself -- not found in Mark -- is treated in connection with the subject of the evangelist, or rather of the Holy Ghost, by his pen.<a name=334:12></a> Luke's account of Christ's birth, far more detailed than Matthew's, bears its own stamp too.<a name=334:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I will now consider the order of Matthew and the reasons of it, as far as God enables me.<a name=334:14></a> Matthew gives us the presenting of Messiah-Jehovah, Son of David, to the people; and the form His service took in consequence of His rejection, with the substitution of the new thing which took the place of Messiah's being then received -- the church prophetically announced, and the kingdom of glory.<a name=334:15></a> The residue of Israel have also their place beyond the intervening epoch of the church, existing on to the close.<a name=334:16></a> The general subject of the Gospel, what characterises it, is the presenting of Messiah-Jehovah according to hope and promise, and its consequences.<a name=334:17></a> Hence the genealogy by which the Gospel begins<a href="#334:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> is Messiah's genealogy, traced to David and Abraham, the two great depositaries of promise and heads of blessing to Israel by original promise and given royalty.<a name=334:18></a> Christ was heir of both.<a name=334:19></a> It begins also the Gospel; for the accomplishment of this blessing, according to promise, is its subject.<a name=334:20></a> Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God to confirm the promises made to the fathers.<a name=334:21></a> Luke has his genealogy elsewhere, after the whole history of Christ's birth has been given in connection with Israel, but in Israel's subject-place in the world.<a name=334:22></a> From heaven only the angels announce its universal scope.<a name=334:23></a> It is connected with the opening of His ministry, and goes up to Son of Adam, Son of God.<a name=334:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#334:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>Remark, that the Gospel of Matthew begins with this genealogy; for, coming in the way of promise, the connection of Christ with the stock of promise was the foundation-stone of His position. In Luke, the genealogy is not till chapter 4 and goes up to Adam. The connection is with man. What precedes, is a very full and most interesting statement of every element of the actual condition of Israel. Then begins the Son of man's history -- grace.

		To return to Matthew.<a name=335:1></a> In speaking of Christ's birth, Joseph is addressed as son of David, Mary being espoused to him.<a name=335:2></a> The child's name thus divinely born is to be called Jehovah the Saviour, for He is to save His people from their sins; all coming to pass, that the prophecy of Emmanuel's coming might be fulfilled.<a name=335:3></a> He was the Emmanuel of Israel who was thus born.<a name=335:4></a>

		Next, at Bethlehem, according to the prophecy, the Gentiles come to own Israel's king, in contrast, moreover, with the false one.<a name=335:5></a> Such is His place; but, from the beginning, to be rejected in it.<a name=335:6></a> But He is to begin Israel's fortunes afresh, so to speak, as called out of Egypt, the true vine.<a name=335:7></a> In due time He returns back, but it is to take His place with the remnant of Israel, the poor of the flock, in despised Galilee, and be called a Nazarene.<a name=335:8></a> Such was the place in Israel of Jehovah-Messiah: fulfilment of promise -- the place to which He had really a title, what He really was -- His place, in fact.<a name=335:9></a> Such are the three great elements of the history of the introduction of Christ into the world, as given in this Gospel.<a name=335:10></a> Of course, this is not in Mark; but it gives to us the character of the Gospel.<a name=335:11></a> Matthew then passes on to the opening of His ministry, John preparing His way.<a name=335:12></a> This, and the temptation, are given in all three Gospels, as the two opening facts, but with some characteristic differences.<a name=335:13></a> As to John's ministry, it is simply generally introductory.<a name=335:14></a> In Luke you have "All flesh shall see the salvation of God"; and various moral instructions to different classes; and the title of "generation of vipers" is applied to the multitude in general.<a name=335:15></a> In Matthew he is simply to prepare the way of the Lord (Jehovah).<a name=335:16></a> His prophetic appearance is noticed.<a name=335:17></a> The Pharisees and Sadducees only are a generation of vipers.<a name=335:18></a> In Luke he preaches the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins; in Matthew "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.<a name=335:19></a>" As regards the temptation, Mark only briefly mentions the fact.<a name=335:20></a> The only point to be noticed is, that Luke puts the temptation of the pinnacle of the temple last, giving the moral order: Matthew, the offer of the kingdoms of the world; after which, he sends Satan (now fully manifested) away.<a name=335:21></a> Luke, consequently, does not notice this last circumstance, not necessary for his object.<a name=335:22></a> Matthew and Mark both notice that Jesus' ministry commenced after John was cast into prison.<a name=335:23></a> This makes Him go into Galilee.<a name=335:24></a>

		In Matthew, thereupon, a fact is noticed which casts a light on the course of the Lord's ministry, connecting Him, as it does, with the poor and despised of the flock in Galilee.<a name=336:1></a> He came and dwelt in Capernaum, leaving Nazareth; accomplishing thus a remarkable prophecy of Isaiah, directly connected with the most specific prophecy there is, of the separation of the residue in Messiah's time.<a name=336:2></a> (See Isaiah 8: 13, and following.<a name=336:3></a>) All this is generally stated in Luke (chapter 4: 14, 15), only His preaching in Nazareth is given<a href="#336:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> -- of that when we speak of Luke.<a name=336:4></a>

		Hereupon, the Spirit of God, without defining any time, but merely saying that the sight of the multitudes gave occasion to it, enters into a full statement, well known as the Sermon on the Mount, of the great principles of the kingdom embraced as preached, before it came in power, by a faithful few, to whom persecution for righteousness, and for His name's sake, is presented as a probable part of their lot.<a name=337:1></a> These principles are the spirituality of the law, and the revelation of the name of the Father.<a name=337:2></a> Israel was on the way to the Judge.<a name=337:3></a> It was not the great, wise, doctors, Pharisees, but the poor of the flock that entered into the mind of God about the state of things -- were like Christ -- who would enter into the kingdom.<a name=337:4></a> It is not preaching the gospel of salvation, but the principles of the kingdom.<a name=337:5></a> The suitableness of this, after shewing us how the preaching of that kingdom had attracted the notice of all, is evident.<a name=337:6></a> The comparison of Mark 3: 13, and Luke 6, shews, I think, clearly, that these are the same occasion; but Mark does not give the sermon; and Luke, who does more briefly, shews it was when He had chosen the twelve.<a name=337:7></a> This last circumstance is not given in Matthew.<a name=337:8></a> They are noticed as already chosen, at the time of their sending forth (chapter 10: 1), which was a subsequent act.<a name=337:9></a>

		We can hardly speak of date in Matthew for the sermon on the mount; because, while Mark gives details of Christ's ministry in Galilee (of which Matthew, indeed, gives many afterwards), Matthew here gives a general comprehensive view of that ministry as a whole.<a name=337:10></a> Still it was, in a general way, at its commencement; and the sermon is introduced, out of its historic place, before all the details of the ministry in Galilee, in order to give the character of the heirs of the kingdom, when the fact of its preaching in Galilee, and the public attention it had excited, had been brought before us.<a name=337:11></a> The place which these instructions have in this Gospel is entirely determined by the subject.<a name=337:12></a> He gathers the residue round Himself.<a name=337:13></a> The kingdom is announced in all the prophetic country (Galilee) with power, the report spread, the character of the kingdom given.<a name=337:14></a> This closes the great introductory portion.<a name=337:15></a> We have then the details of the presentation of Jehovah Messiah, and the result gradually developed: and that at once very rapidly and characteristically.<a name=337:16></a> For the great statement, as a whole, of what was doing as regards Israel, was closed with the sermon on the mount.<a name=337:17></a>

		A second portion of this Gospel closes with chapter 9: 34.<a name=338:1></a> Into this second part I will now enter.<a name=338:2></a> First, He is Jehovah in Israel; for Jehovah alone cleansed the leper, and the Jewish Mosaic ordinances are here owned.<a name=338:3></a> This miracle is introduced out of its place.<a name=338:4></a> It took place after the going into Capernaum, and healing Simon's wife's mother.<a name=338:5></a> But it gave the first grand characteristic of Jesus' presence in this Gospel -- Jehovah Messiah in Israel.<a name=338:6></a> But Matthew teaches us the rejection also of this, and the consequent setting aside of Israel, and the introduction of the new thing.<a name=338:7></a> Hence, on the cleansing of the leprosy by "I will, be thou clean," follows the healing of the Gentile's servant on the Gentile's faith in the divine person of the Christ, with the announcement of the admission of the nations, from all sides, into the kingdom, with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, while the children of the kingdom would be thrust out.<a name=338:8></a>

		Another characteristic element of His condition, as thus come in Israel, was that Messiah and Lord as He was, He had nowhere to lay His head.<a name=339:1></a> He was just going to cross over the sea of Tiberias, when He declared this to the scribe: but this happened later in His service in Galilee, as we see by comparing Mark and Luke.<a name=339:2></a> But it is introduced here in Matthew, without any note of time, as an important element in the position of Jesus.<a name=339:3></a> The circumstances of this passage over the sea, afford us another element of His history.<a name=339:4></a> Not only is He rejected and houseless, through man's hatred, and God's love serving man in spite of that hatred; but, if so, His disciples, the remnant, will be tossed about while He appears to be asleep.<a name=339:5></a> But they are in the same boat with Him who can calm the sea with a word, and still the raging of the waters, though He may allow them to rise for the trial of the faith of those that are His.<a name=339:6></a>

		Here Matthew returns pretty much to the general order of the history of His service in Galilee; but the bearing of the Gospel is fully maintained.<a name=340:1></a> The Lord heals the sick of the palsy in Capernaum, His own city, as it is called; for there He had fixed His residence when not going through the country.<a name=340:2></a> This case begins a new series, shewing the power, character, and efficacy of His coming, always keeping in view, and illustrative of, the general subject of the Gospel.<a name=340:3></a> That coming is presented here to Israel, according to promise; and its result as reaching far beyond Israel on His rejection.<a name=340:4></a> And here the case of the paralytic is presented with special view to this result; that is, to the place Jesus takes as rejected by Israel, and the grace and personal power from which that flows.<a name=340:5></a> Palsied as man, as Israel particularly, was, the source of this in the government of God lay deeper than outward circumstances.<a name=340:6></a> It was their sins that had brought them there.<a name=340:7></a> But grace had come; one having title to forgive, and specially here as regards God's ways and government, though surely in view of, and founded on, the needed sacrifice.<a name=340:8></a> He is really the Son of man (far more than King of Israel); but, as such, He has brought grace and power into the midst of the people.<a name=340:9></a> The Lord meets the whole case -- goes to the heart and conscience of the sufferer.<a name=340:10></a> "Son, be of good cheer, thy sins be forgiven thee.<a name=340:11></a>" In reply to the reasoning of the scribes in their hearts, He, who searches the heart, replies by this wonderful truth: "The Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins.<a name=340:12></a>" Thus He takes not the title of Messiah, not the righteous man of Psalm 1, nor the Son of God of Psalm 2, but of the Son of man of Psalm 8; His full title, when rejected in the former character, and, at the same time, of perfect grace, as entering into man's condition and sorrow.<a name=340:13></a> To prove His title, He by a word makes the paralytic rise up and walk.<a name=340:14></a> This act then, under the title of Son of man, is of the largest import.<a name=340:15></a> It is grace, forgiveness so as to restore.<a name=340:16></a> He is Son of man -- all Israel wants -- but His title much larger; and meanwhile the Accomplisher of that which is the witness that He is the Jehovah of Israel's blessing (though coming as Son of man), who forgives all their sins and heals all their infirmities.<a name=340:17></a> He proved His title to one by the accomplishment of the other.<a name=340:18></a> In this way it is very characteristic.<a name=340:19></a> Compare Psalm 103: 3.<a name=340:20></a> The Lord, in this Gospel, never calls Himself anything but Son of man; others, Son of David; and the demons, Son of God.<a name=340:21></a><a name=341>[Page 341]</a>

		In what follows in Matthew, we have the Lord's persevering grace in Israel, though the new wine, He well knew, had to be put into new bottles.<a name=341:19></a> Israel's real state is shewn, explaining why there must be this new power -- life-giving power -- introduced; but grace towards Israel is shewn, which will persevere across (however temporarily suspended by judgment on the people) the whole church interval of time, to resume its activity in the latter days towards the beloved and chosen people.<a name=341:20></a> This is remarkably brought out to the end of chapter 10.<a name=341:21></a> The disciples are sent forth, forbidden to go to Gentiles or Samaritans; and they would not have gone over the cities of Israel till the Son of man will come.<a name=341:22></a> Chapter 11 brings out their present rejection, as having rejected John and Himself; the revelation of the Father by the Son being the result -- the resource of the heavy-laden, the easy yoke in the midst of sorrow.<a name=341:23></a>

		I may remark here, that Matthew having, in order to shew the principles of the kingdom, introduced the sermon on the mount, already as a great general feature of the Lord's teaching early in the Gospel, omits here the choosing of the twelve; on which, after coming down to a level place (English translation, "the plain") a little lower down the mountain, the sermon seems to have followed.<a name=342:1></a> See Mark 3: 13; and Luke 6.<a name=342:2></a> The case of Jairus' daughter, on the other hand, and of the woman who touched the hem of His garment, are introduced here; though this comes, I apprehend, historically, after the parables by the sea-shore, and Jesus' return from healing Legion; the last Matthew had, as we have seen, already given to complete his general picture of Jewish history.<a name=342:3></a>

		The bearing of the two facts recorded in chapter 9, consequent on the teaching as to the new bottles and before the Jewish mission of chapter 10, on the course of the Messianic history as presented by Matthew, I shall now advert to.<a name=342:4></a> The real state of Israel was death.<a name=342:5></a> On the point of dying as seen by others, in God's estimate Israel was dead before Jesus came.<a name=342:6></a> He visited it as dying -- He really found it dead.<a name=342:7></a> So it is treated here; but, come in life-giving power, Jesus will give it life.<a name=342:8></a> This will be accomplished when He comes again; but He was, at His first coming, on the way with Israel and the whole crowd around Him, and power in Him where faith was in exercise through grace, to arrest death, to give life where all else had failed.<a name=342:9></a> The poor woman thus represents the residue whose faith laid hold on Jesus in the midst of the crowd around, and thus distinguished from it.<a name=342:10></a> These the Lord owned.<a name=342:11></a> They are healed and saved on the way.<a name=342:12></a> As regards the one for whom He set out, He must, when the time comes, not heal but raise from the dead.<a name=342:13></a> For God holds Israel yet as but asleep, though really dead morally.<a name=342:14></a> This will be at the close.<a name=342:15></a> Hence He acts in power with the blind in Israel, who own Him Son of David.<a name=342:16></a> On their faith, following Him even apart from the crowd and assured He could do it, He gives them sight.<a name=342:17></a> The dumb, in like manner, receives his speech.<a name=342:18></a> Sight and a voice to praise are restored to them.<a name=342:19></a> It was never so seen in Israel.<a name=342:20></a> The Pharisees, blaspheming, ascribe it to Satan.<a name=342:21></a> But we have seen that the subject here is the persevering grace towards Israel, of which the two forms were shewn in the woman and Jairus' daughter.<a name=342:22></a>

		Hence, in spite of the blasphemy of the Pharisees, which yet shews the condition of Israel as a nation, the Lord continues His course of patient grace (chapter 9: 35), and seeing the shepherdless multitudes, is moved with compassion, and utters to His disciples His sense of the greatness of the harvest and the fewness of the labourers, urging them to pray to the harvest's Lord to send them out; and in this spirit sends the twelve forth.<a name=343:1></a> These are sent exclusively to the house of Israel -- the lost sheep of the house of Israel in the midst of opposition and difficulty; but their mission continues after Christ's death, but still viewed as exclusively to Israel, and omitting all notice of the church or Gentiles, and overleaps all the time in which the people are not as such in the land, and tells them to go through the cities, which they would not have done till the Son of man was come.<a name=343:2></a> He was there, but the Lord goes on till He be come as such in power.<a name=343:3></a> It is, as I have said, the persevering grace to Israel distinguishing the remnant.<a name=343:4></a> This mission, relatively to what immediately proceeds, is not out of its historical order in Matthew; but its exclusively Israelitish character is only in this Gospel.<a name=343:5></a>

		In chapter 11 the Lord returns to the present position of Israel in reference to Himself, and its results as to the place He was about to take, the real reason of His rejection.<a name=343:6></a> The preparatory message of John is closed, and he comes to have his own personal place according to his own faith.<a name=343:7></a> Great above all born of women, the least in the kingdom is greater than he.<a name=343:8></a> The Lord bears witness to him, not he to the Lord.<a name=343:9></a> He is rejected; Christ is rejected by the Jews: warnings and grace alike.<a name=343:10></a> But the real truth of this rejection was, not his want of worthiness, but that Christ's person is too glorious to be known by any but the Father; or the Father whom He made known, by any but Him, and such as He revealed Him to; all were dependent on this, that is, on Christ's revelation of the Father to them.<a name=343:11></a> That is the glory of His person as Son -- as Man on earth is brought out.<a name=343:12></a> Next in reward of perfect submission comes full joy.<a name=343:13></a> He had learnt the sorrows of man; knew how hopeless to seek good there, and presents Himself in grace as the rest of the weary, and the spirit of submission as shewn in Him for repose of soul on the way.<a name=343:14></a> This is historically the complete change of the dispensation.<a name=343:15></a>

		Mark has not this account, and the two parts of this discourse in Matthew (that is, the rejection of John and Christ, and the shewing what His rejection by the Jews, while guilty as to what they did see, really came from, that is, the divine glory of His person which none could fathom; and the blessed remedy in Christ's revealing the Father to the babes) belong historically to different times.<a name=344:1></a> The latter part is found in Luke 10: 21, where it is said, "in the same hour," which is precise; and it is found after the mission to the seventy, where its connection is beautifully evident on the joy of His disciples on their return.<a name=344:2></a> It is general here, in Matthew 11: 25; it was "at that epoch" or "season": and such it essentially was, when His rejection, now after His ministry, took a definite form and a decided character.<a name=344:3></a> Luke's statement in chapter 8, of what the Lord says as to John, has also a more moral character, that is, more reference to the moral grounds of rejection, less to the dispensational.<a name=344:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This change of dispensation is brought out in a very important point, in what follows in Matthew.<a name=344:5></a> The sabbath was a formal seal of the covenant, "I gave them my sabbaths.<a name=344:6></a>" See Ezekiel 20: 12.<a name=344:7></a> These were the intimation of, and based on, the idea of rest in the first creation, and that by man's obedience under law, and the connection of Israel with God, as a people enjoying promise on the condition of obedience.<a name=344:8></a> Not only they had failed, but they had practically rejected the great Repairer of Breaches -- the obedient One.<a name=344:9></a> The introduction of the facts relative to the sabbath here is only so far out of the chronological place as the introduction of other posterior events has pushed them forward.<a name=344:10></a> Their moral place, in connection with the object of the Gospel, the change of dispensation or ground of relationship with God, consequent on the rejection of Jehovah Messiah, is evident.<a name=344:11></a> Two great principles are presented; -- the Son of man is Lord of the sabbath, and -- grace -- it is lawful to do good; mercy, not sacrifice, is what God delights in.<a name=344:12></a> Some interesting details are connected with it.<a name=344:13></a> David's rejection opened this liberty.<a name=344:14></a> Sacred things had become in a measure common.<a name=344:15></a> So now where David's Son was.<a name=344:16></a> The priests profaned it in the temple.<a name=344:17></a> The glory of Christ's person was above the temple, as the duties of that, because God was there, were above the sabbath.<a name=344:18></a> Had they understood mercy, they would have had moral light, and not condemned those who through the glory of the Son of man were entirely guiltless.<a name=344:19></a> His person was above the conventional bond He Himself had formed, His rejection (and Son of man, compare Psalms 8 and 2, implies that), broke it on their part wholly, giving place to this higher and wider title.<a name=344:20></a> Thus the sign of the first covenant with Israel, and expression of God's rest in creation, had found the place in which the truth of man's and Israel's state set it.<a name=344:21></a> Only sovereign grace took up the hope of rest; and, blessed be His name, through the unchangeable title of His person, above the effect of responsibility in His creation.<a name=344:22></a>

		The closing scene is then beautifully and solemnly brought out.<a name=345:1></a> The Pharisees seek to destroy Him.<a name=345:2></a> The judgment of their system, and the introduction of supreme grace, was insupportable.<a name=345:3></a> But Christ was not now to execute judgment.<a name=345:4></a> He would shew judgment to the Gentiles, but personally then He would not break the bruised reed nor quench the smoking flax till He sent forth judgment to victory.<a name=345:5></a> Blind and dumb, healed by His power, are a witness to the people that He is Son of David.<a name=345:6></a> The Pharisees, unable to deny it, ascribed the power they cannot deny to Satan; blaspheming the Holy Ghost.<a name=345:7></a> For this there was no forgiveness.<a name=345:8></a> Sovereign grace may re-create and thus restore Israel; but the tale of its responsible condition is now told.<a name=345:9></a> The tree was corrupt.<a name=345:10></a> It was an evil and adulterous generation; no sign would be given it but that of the Son of man in the heart of the earth like Jonas, and all their hopes buried with it, to be founded by grace on Him they had rejected.<a name=345:11></a> Nineveh and the queen of the south would judge them.<a name=345:12></a> The unclean spirit once gone out, would return with worse; their state and judgment would be worse than when they went to Babylon.<a name=345:13></a> The Lord then denies all His natural ties with flesh, that is, with Israel, in the person of His mother and brethren, and accepts only the fruit of the word in the residue, as that which belongs to Him.<a name=345:14></a>

		In Luke 8: 19 the circumstance of His mother's and brethren's coming is placed at the end of the parable of the sower, bringing out the moral importance of the word without any reference to the rejection of Israel, or mark of date, though there be such found in the English, not in the Greek.<a name=345:15></a> The teaching as to Nineveh and Jonas, and the statement as to Beelzebub, is all given together in that part of the Gospel of Luke which is not chronologically arranged, but events put together in their moral bearing, and so applied; chapter 11: 14-36.<a name=345:16></a> The message of John in Matthew 11, and the internal change connected with it, to the revelation of the Father by the Son, has no place in Mark.<a name=345:17></a> If Luke gives the moral change, and Matthew the governmental one, connected with the rejection of Jehovah-Jesus, Messiah, Mark, who shews us the service of the Lord in testimony, does not present this dispensational change in either form.<a name=345:18></a> The immediate facts leading to it are of course given by him historically in their place.<a name=345:19></a>

		We find, therefore, in our Gospel, before the parables (in which the essential service of Christ in the word is given, and the subsequent forms of the kingdom; and in Mark, what is peculiar to him, the entire absence of Christ's direct ministry when these forms arose) -- before this, I say, we find the blasphemy of the Pharisees, and Christ's preference of His disciples to all natural relationship.<a name=346:1></a> What follows the parables in Mark (save His being despised in His own country, which comes in its place in Matthew, and we will consider farther on), we have already seen transposed in Matthew to an earlier part of the history, where we have seen its application to the subject he treats of.<a name=346:2></a> The facts I refer to are the crossing in a storm, and the history of Legion which follows; the raising of Jairus' daughter, which happened on His return; the woman with an issue of blood, which all go together; and the sending out the twelve, which, as we have seen, is given a peculiar importance in Matthew, and is introduced in connection with a most general statement of His ministry, so as to imply no date; Matthew 9: 35, 36.<a name=346:3></a> But Matthew introduces there, in their proper place relatively to what goes before the displaced series just mentioned, two facts omitted in Luke and Mark, which bore upon his subject in a way already noticed; Matthew 9: 27-34.<a name=346:4></a> On this follows the general statement of His ministry and sending out of the twelve.<a name=346:5></a> Luke, in the main, here follows the order of Mark, that is, gives the history chronologically; Luke 8: 22.<a name=346:6></a>

		In chapter 15, we find the question of a Pharisaic righteousness, and tradition opposed to God's law, and all Israel's worship as a nation, rejected on Isaiah's authority.<a name=348:1></a> God would have the heart right.<a name=348:2></a> To the disciples He denounces the true character of the Pharisees.<a name=348:3></a> They had only to leave them alone; with leaders in evil they were to have nothing to do.<a name=348:4></a> They were leading Israel into the ditch.<a name=348:5></a> The disciples were dull in apprehending this truth; but He explains that truth to them in grace, shewing what man, man's heart, is.<a name=348:6></a> Christ having judged thus the Pharisaic Israel, an important event presents itself.<a name=348:7></a> He does not go out of Israel, but goes to the borders of Tyre and Sidon, which He could take elsewhere as a pattern of evil and obduracy.<a name=348:8></a> There a woman of the accursed race of Canaan meets Him.<a name=348:9></a> She appeals to Him in His character of Heir and Fulfiller of promise: on this ground she has no title, no answer.<a name=348:10></a> Christ fully recognised the people in God's point of view.<a name=348:11></a> The bread was the children's: He is minister of the circumcision.<a name=348:12></a> The woman owns it; but alleges there was grace in God, out of pure goodness, which could reach beyond the dogs which had no title.<a name=348:13></a> Hence she receives the blessing on the ground of what God was: a principle of immense essential importance, and at this moment opening up a ground of God's dealings, which was to be the basis of all hope.<a name=348:14></a> Hence we see Jesus in the midst of Israel, and owning it, but a perspective of blessing which was founded on what God was in Himself, and applicable to the sorrows of one who had no title at all.<a name=348:15></a> In chapter 15: 30, 31, the presence of persevering grace and goodness in Israel, so that every ear that could hear, and every heart that could feel, might be reached in spite of the Pharisees, is brought out in the power of Christ in grace, so that they glorified the God of Israel.<a name=348:16></a> Instead of this general statement, the force of which is evident as regards the place which Christ still held in respect of Israel, we find in Mark a special miracle of opening of ears, and loosing the tongue of the deaf and dumb man -- Christ's personal power and its character (for He will do this for Israel as He does for us).<a name=348:17></a> Hence it is not glorifying the God of Israel there, but Jesus has done all things well -- His service and its excellency.<a name=348:18></a>

		A few of the points in Matthew call for particular notice.<a name=351:1></a> The spirit of a child is the pattern of a Christian.<a name=351:2></a> God has His eyes on little children with special favour.<a name=351:3></a> They are to be received in Christ's name.<a name=351:4></a> It is not the Father's will they should perish; not that they are not lost in nature: but Christ came to save the lost sheep.<a name=351:5></a> The parable of the lost sheep is applied to them.<a name=351:6></a> This last part, as to God's dispensation as to them, is peculiar to Matthew.<a name=351:7></a> Next, extreme jealousy as to occasions of falling, in oneself; care not to stumble the weak; the means to be taken to preserve godly order as to wrongs done, are prescribed; and here the church, i.<a name=351:8></a>e.<a name=351:9></a>, two or three assembled in Christ's name, is introduced as taking its place.<a name=351:10></a> It thus becomes the new centre -- completely takes the place of the synagogue.<a name=351:11></a> What is there bound on earth is ratified in heaven, and what agreed thus to be sought on earth given from heaven.<a name=351:12></a> The two or three assembled in Christ's name become a constituted institution, sealed, when real, by the sanction and authority of heaven, and the inside or outside of it takes the place of Jew and heathen.<a name=351:13></a> This is peculiar to Matthew; this is extended to the spirit of personal forgiveness as regards the individual.<a name=351:14></a> Compare for both 1 Corinthians 6.<a name=351:15></a> But the kingdom of heaven (not the church) is hence like the King who forgives and afterwards brings all on the guilty where the principles of His own conduct were not accepted and imitated.<a name=351:16></a> Thus the Jews (with whom on Christ's intercession God dealt in grace, forgiving them the ten thousand talents, refusing grace towards the Gentiles) came under the full guilt of all as to God's ways with them as to the kingdom.<a name=351:17></a> But the principle is now morally true, save the general principle stated elsewhere; this also is peculiar to Matthew.<a name=351:18></a>

		The teaching of the Lord on marriage, is not in Luke, referring, as it does, to the peculiar instructions of Judaism.<a name=352:1></a> The latter part which introduces the special power of the new thing, while sanctioning God's original and gracious institution, is in Matthew alone.<a name=352:2></a> 1 Corinthians 7 answers to this.<a name=352:3></a> The case of the children and of the young man, in which nature as God created it is held blessed; the law, as applied to man (second table), shewn to be the path of life, if nature could keep it, is found in all.<a name=352:4></a> Sovereign grace is needed for being saved, for flesh is fallen and evil; and seeks, if outwardly blameless, its delight elsewhere than in God.<a name=352:5></a> This is more briefly stated in Luke, as a great general principle.<a name=352:6></a> The answer to Peter on this point, in Matthew, has this also in particular, that it introduces the dispensational glory hereafter in the kingdom, and thereon adds the parable of the householder and labourers, to guard, by sovereign grace and goodness, against the tendency to turn the encouragement afforded by reward into a claim of self-righteousness.<a name=352:7></a> It is on the seizing of this, and through this, and the already stated principle of the first last, and last first, depends.<a name=352:8></a> Only grace, and because it is grace, inverts it, and puts last first: while the former states the shortcoming of nature, that first shall be thus last.<a name=352:9></a>

		The parable of the husbandman, and the revelation of the rejected stone, are next in all three Gospels: the various classes of persons in Israel come up for judgment.<a name=354:1></a> But this parable is general: referring to all that were active in the vineyard the Lord had planted.<a name=354:2></a> This was taken from the Jews.<a name=354:3></a> Broken now by stumbling on the stone, they would be ground to powder when He should fall on them, that is, all on whom it should; for, indeed, they will not then be alone, as they were in the stumbling on the stone.<a name=354:4></a> But responsibility to bear fruit was not all.<a name=354:5></a> They had rejected gracious invitations to the marriage of the king's son.<a name=354:6></a> This is not in Mark.<a name=354:7></a> In Luke 14 there is a similar parable.<a name=354:8></a> I am not quite clear whether it is the same.<a name=354:9></a> It is, if so, introduced in Luke in its place, and its absence from Mark here accounted for.<a name=354:10></a> It is not introduced in Matthew, with any connection of time or circumstance, as having been spoken at this time.<a name=354:11></a> Its place, as to the judgment of the Jews, is evident.<a name=354:12></a> They are judged in it for the rejection of grace, as they are in the parable of the husbandman for failure in producing fruit.<a name=354:13></a>

		Some circumstances are added in Matthew, and which are important as to the judicial dealings of God, which are wholly omitted in Luke: while the moral tone and pursuit of grace, in spite of evil, is more largely delineated in Luke.<a name=354:14></a> The contrast of the dealings of God with Jews and Gentiles, with which last the house is filled, and the judgment, both of Jews and professing Christendom, is what characterises Matthew.<a name=354:15></a> The difference of the two parables in Luke and Matthew will make us sensible of the characteristic difference of what is given of God in the two Gospels.<a name=354:16></a> I will enter, therefore, into the details of each, sufficiently to shew it.<a name=354:17></a> In Matthew it is a similitude of the kingdom of heaven.<a name=354:18></a> In Matthew, we have two messages; those, I doubt not, of the apostles in the lifetime of Christ, and of the same after His death, when all was accomplished and ready.<a name=354:19></a> It is, in a general way, made light of.<a name=354:20></a> By others, the servants are ill-treated and slain.<a name=354:21></a> Thereupon the murderers (the Jews) are slain, and their city destroyed.<a name=354:22></a> This is the judgment on the Jews and Jerusalem.<a name=354:23></a> Then the message is sent out to the highways (the Gentiles), and the wedding furnished.<a name=354:24></a> There a person is found (many are called, but few chosen) not having personally what belonged to and suited the wedding, and he is cast out into outer darkness.<a name=354:25></a> This is, evidently, more than an earthly dispensational judgment.<a name=354:26></a> In Luke, a certain man makes a great supper: it is not for the king's son, nor the kingdom of heaven.<a name=354:27></a> The two first summons of Matthew come together, in general, or are absorbed in one; the moral details of excuse are given, and there is no slaying and ill-treating of servants.<a name=354:28></a> There the poor of the city (that is, among the Jews) are sought out; but this does not fill the house, and the highways and hedges are sent to (the Gentiles), and the house filled.<a name=354:29></a> There is no judgment of the Jews, nor of the unworthy guests.<a name=354:30></a> The moral character in grace of the parable in Luke, is evident; the dispensational dealing in Matthew, equally so.<a name=354:31></a> Only the Jewish rejecters do not taste of the supper.<a name=354:32></a> We can well suppose it to be a different parable, though the Holy Ghost gives us but a very small part of what was done and said, and even of one and the same discourse only what instructs on the point in hand.<a name=354:33></a>

		Next, the Pharisees and Herodians are judged, the opposed classes among the Jews, of strict and temporising Jews.<a name=355:1></a> Christ puts the Jewish position (and, indeed, of everyone) on the true ground; I mean as to their real relationship to the Gentile power or empires.<a name=355:2></a> Next, the Sadducees are judged, and the true nature of the resurrection shewn, and from Moses himself; only Luke, in addition, gives here a clear statement of the connection of the resurrection with the age to come; and, at the same time, affirms the abiding intermediate state of the soul.<a name=355:3></a> Next, the essence of the law is taught.<a name=355:4></a> The same instruction is found in the general teaching in Luke, not in the parallel place to this, and the parable of the good Samaritan is annexed.<a name=355:5></a> But this, I apprehend, was another statement to the same effect, as may easily be conceived.<a name=355:6></a> The true substance of the law being stated, the position the Christ was to take, unintelligible for the Pharisee, and consequent on His rejection, is then brought out, and silences the pretended wisdom of the Jewish teachers.<a name=355:7></a> The Lord's instruction is drawn from Psalm 110.<a name=355:8></a> It is easy to see how this closes, with the most perfect fitness, these remarkable interviews.<a name=355:9></a>

		We now arrive at the circumstances attending the resurrection, which are different in each Gospel, and evidently enough connected with the object of each.<a name=360:11></a> For instance, the ascension is left out in Matthew, and Christ is associated with His disciples in Galilee, the place of His visiting the remnant, the connection with which is maintained all through Matthew, as in chapters 10 and 24.<a name=360:12></a> The first verse of chapter 28, I apprehend, was Saturday evening when Sabbath was past; the second relates to an event not in immediate connection with their visit when they came in the morning.<a name=360:13></a> The stone was already rolled away.<a name=360:14></a> Indeed Mary Magdalene seems to have been there before the others, while it was yet dark, and the stone was already gone.<a name=360:15></a> Matthew puts with the women's visit, in a general way, yet in a distinct paragraph, the effect of the circumstances attending the rolling away the stone: how the keepers trembled at the visiting of the tomb by the angel to roll it away; whereas, when the women came, the angel answered and said, "Fear not ye.<a name=360:16></a>" They are told to go and tell the disciples He would go into Galilee, and they would see Him there.<a name=360:17></a> Jesus meets them as they return, and tells them the same thing.<a name=360:18></a> We are then shewn the final and wilful obstinacy of the nation in rejecting the testimony of their own instruments, which they knew and believed to be true.<a name=360:19></a> Christ joins the disciples in Galilee.<a name=360:20></a> There, in virtue of all power being given Him in heaven and earth, they receive their commission to go and make disciples of all the nations: the mission is now extended to the nations, not confined to Israel; they were to baptize them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, the great dispensational christian revelation, to teach them to observe what Christ had commanded, and He would be with them to the end of the age.<a name=360:21></a> This mission rested on the fact of all power being Christ's in heaven and on earth, and extended the previous missions of the remnant, instituting one which embraced the nations at large.<a name=360:22></a> These were to be made disciples of.<a name=360:23></a> The account is very general and brief, only adding how the stone was rolled away to the other accounts; the whole else is the meeting in Galilee and consequent mission.<a name=360:24></a> This is the more remarkable, as Matthew must have been present at what John relates of Jesus appearing in their midst at Jerusalem.<a name=360:25></a>

		Mark leads us at once to the morning of the first day, at the rising of the sun: and we have the details, as to the women, of what Matthew only gave the general result of.<a name=361:1></a> The same message is given: but it is not followed up farther.<a name=361:2></a> The meeting with Mary Magdalene, of which we have the details in John, is stated, and that of the two disciples going to Emmaus, of which Luke gives the details; also the general fact of His appearing to the twelve [eleven] together at meat, of which we have details in Luke and John.<a name=361:3></a> We have then, His ressurection having been recounted, the universal mission and continuation of service in the power of Christ Himself, the consequence of faith and public acknowledgement of Christ on one side, and of the refusal of the gospel on the other.<a name=361:4></a> The fact of His ascension and session at the right hand of God; their going forth to preach everywhere, according to the mission and of the power which accompanied their service according to promise, are then recorded.<a name=361:5></a> This, while connecting the accounts of all the Gospels, as to the proofs of His resurrection, has the character of service and testimony, which we have seen belong to Mark.<a name=361:6></a>

		The commencement of the account in Luke is pretty much the same as in Mark and Matthew: the women go to the sepulchre, and are told by the angels that He is risen; but no details are given, only it is said in general that the women told the apostles and the rest, and that Peter ran to the sepulchre.<a name=362:1></a> But we have large and interesting details as to the two who go to Emmaus: there is nothing as to going into Galilee.<a name=362:2></a> But two very important points are brought out, not in the other Gospels.<a name=362:3></a> He opens their understandings to understand the scriptures, and they are to wait at Jerusalem until they are endued with power from on high; the two essential and necessary means of christian service, as it has always to go on.<a name=362:4></a> The apparition to Simon, mentioned by Paul, 1 Corinthians 15, is also mentioned, and, briefly, the Lord's coming into their midst when assembled.<a name=362:5></a> The corporeal reality, though it was now a spiritual body of His human nature, is very prominently brought out: He was still a living man with flesh and bones.<a name=362:6></a> He explains the Old Testament as to Himself, both on the way to Emmaus and here.<a name=362:7></a> His death and resurrection are shewn as in the mind of God, and repentance and remission of sins were to be preached to all the nations, beginning, according to the dispensation of God, and in grace, with the "Jew first.<a name=362:8></a>" All connection with Galilee is omitted.<a name=362:9></a> He begins afresh with Jerusalem as from heaven, and so with all nations.<a name=362:10></a>

		It is the gospel as we know it has been preached, and (leaving out the church) as Paul preached it; and the Acts present it to us.<a name=362:11></a> The account goes on as if Christ went out that same first day to Bethany, and that He then ascended thence -- so entirely is Galilee left out.<a name=362:12></a> Yet Luke is he who in the Acts lets us know Christ rested forty days before He ascended; but he gives, by divine wisdom, like the others, what the truth was he was given to teach.<a name=362:13></a> Christ leaves them for heaven, blessing as He leaves.<a name=362:14></a> As to the first effect, while full of joy, they are daily in the temple.<a name=362:15></a> There Christianity had its cradle and its birthplace.<a name=362:16></a> The character of the close of the Gospel is evident.<a name=362:17></a> Bethany was the place Christ frequented the last week before He suffered: the home of His beloved ones in grace, where He was anointed for death -- where He shewed Himself Son of God in resurrection.<a name=362:18></a> This He transfers to heaven, and blesses as He goes up.<a name=362:19></a> They associate all with the temple.<a name=362:20></a> This was more than tarrying at Jerusalem, or beginning with it.<a name=362:21></a> What a true picture of it all!<a name=362:22></a> How much more we learn here of the great truths of Christianity connected with His resurrection than in Matthew or Mark.<a name=362:23></a> It is not simply the fact, nor continuing the scene or connection in which He had been, or merely extending it.<a name=362:24></a> John has as we know, while full in this part of the Lord's history, quite another character.<a name=362:25></a> Surely this comparison of the Gospels, and of the details as their contents, throws much light on the purpose of the Gospels, and of each of them distinctively, and abundantly confirms the divine inspiration of all, because the mind of God shines all through their structure.<a name=362:26></a>
