		THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Acts of the Apostles are divided essentially into three parts -- chapters 1, 2 to 12; and 13 to the end.<a name=1:1></a> Chapters 11, 12 may be termed transitional chapters founded on the event related in chapter 10.<a name=1:2></a> Chapter 1 gives us that which is connected with the Lord's resurrection; chapters 2 - 12 that work of the Holy Ghost of which Jerusalem and the Jews were the centre, but which branches out into the free action of the Spirit of God, independent of, but not separated from, the twelve and Jerusalem as the centre; chapter 13, and the succeeding chapters, the work of Paul, flowing from a more distinct mission from Antioch; chapter 15 connecting the two in order to preserve unity in the whole course.<a name=1:3></a> We have indeed the admission of Gentiles in the second part, but it is in connection with the work going on among the Jews.<a name=1:4></a> These latter had rejected the witness of the Holy Ghost to a glorified Christ, as they had rejected the Son of God in His humiliation; and God prepared a work outside them, in which the apostle of the Gentiles laid foundations that annulled the distinction between Jew and Gentile, and which unite them -- as in themselves equally dead in trespasses and sins -- to Christ, the Head of His body, the assembly, in heaven.<a name=1:5></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#46:1">footnote</a></i>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us now examine the chapters in their course.<a name=1:6></a> <b>Chapter 1</b> supplies us with the narrative of that which relates to Jesus risen, and the actions of the apostles before the descent of the Holy Ghost.<a name=1:7></a> The Lord's communications present several very interesting points.<a name=1:8></a> Jesus, the risen man, acts and speaks by the Holy Ghost after His resurrection as before it.<a name=1:9></a> Precious token of our own position, as reminding us that we shall have the Holy Ghost after our resurrection, and that, being no longer engaged in restraining and mortifying the flesh, His divine

		energy in us will be entirely consecrated to eternal joy and worship, and to the service committed to us by God.<a name=2:1></a> The risen Lord then gives His disciples commandments in connection with the new position He assumes.<a name=2:2></a> Their life and their service are to be formed and guided in view of His resurrection -- a truth of which they had irrefragable proofs.<a name=2:3></a> They were still on earth, but they were pilgrims there, having Him in view who had gone before them raised from among the dead.<a name=2:4></a> Their relations with Him are still connected with their position on earth.<a name=2:5></a> He speaks to them of the kingdom, and of that which concerned the kingdom.<a name=2:6></a> Jerusalem was the starting-point of their ministry, even more than of His own.<a name=2:7></a> For He had gathered together the poor of the flock wherever He had found them, especially in Galilee;(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#46:2">footnote</a></i>) but now, resurrection having made Him in power the vessel of the sure mercies of David, He calls Israel afresh to own as Prince and Saviour the One whom they had rejected as the living Messiah on earth.<a name=2:8></a> The Epistles of Peter are connected with the gospel in this point of view.<a name=2:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Nevertheless, to exercise this ministry, they were to wait for the accomplishment of the Father's promise, the Holy Ghost, with whom they were to be baptised, according to John's testimony, which the Lord assured them should soon take place.<a name=2:10></a> The mission of the Holy Ghost led them, at the same time, out of the Jewish field of purely temporal promises.<a name=2:11></a> The Father's promise of the Holy Ghost was a very different thing from that of the restoration of the kingdom of Israel by the power of Jehovah, the God of judgment.<a name=2:12></a> It was not for them to know the time and season of this restoration, the knowledge of which the Father kept in His own possession; but they should themselves receive the power of the Holy Ghost, who would come down upon them; and they should be witnesses unto Jesus (as they had known Him, and according to the manifestation of Himself after His resurrection), both in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost parts of the earth -- thus making Jerusalem the starting-point and first object, according to the mission, <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:47">Luke  24:47</a>.<a name=2:13></a> Nevertheless, their testimony was founded on their

		All this clearly shews the position in which they were placed, and the mission committed to them.<a name=3:9></a> But before they receive the Holy Ghost for its fulfilment, some other characteristic circumstances find their place in this chapter.<a name=3:10></a> They act, under the guidance of Peter, according to intelligence in the word, before they are endowed with power from on high.<a name=3:11></a> These two things are therefore distinct from each other.<a name=3:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It appears that, although Peter was not directly led of the Holy Ghost, the Spirit put His seal on that which was done in accordance with the word in the Old Testament understood by the apostle.<a name=3:13></a> We have before seen that Christ, after His resurrection, opened the understanding of His disciples that they might understand the scriptures.<a name=3:14></a> They now act, not having received the Holy Ghost, according to a Jewish principle.<a name=3:15></a> They present the lot to the Lord, that He may decide.<a name=3:16></a> Nevertheless the lot was not all, nor was it drawn without making a distinction.<a name=3:17></a> Apostolic authority flowed from the nomination of Christ Himself.<a name=3:18></a> Intelligence of the scriptures makes them understand that which ought to be.<a name=3:19></a> The object which the Lord had assigned to their service narrowed the choice to the little circle of those who could fulfil that object.<a name=3:20></a> Their history made them capable, as Jesus had said, of being His witnesses, because they had been with Him from the beginning, and could now testify that this same Jesus, whom

	<div class="paragraph">
		Apostolic authority is exercised in Jerusalem on the Jewish principle, before the gift of the Holy Ghost.<a name=4:2></a> In this there was neither research nor the exercise of the human mind.<a name=4:3></a> "His bishopric let another take" guided their conduct; the capacity to testify of Jesus in His life on earth, and now of His resurrection and ascension, decided on the needed qualifications; the lot of Jehovah determined the individual who was to take Judas' place.<a name=4:4></a> Two are chosen, according to these needful qualifications, and the lot falls upon Matthias, who is numbered with the eleven apostles.<a name=4:5></a> But they were still without the promised power.<a name=4:6></a>

		This event, important beyond all others with respect to man's condition here below, has here a very simple character, because there is no question of the causes of this marvellous gift, of the work on which it depends, of the glory with which it is connected and which it reveals, and of which it is the earnest: we have here only the fact of its power.<a name=4:9></a> The disciples "were endued with power from on high".<a name=4:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The form of its appearance, however, is characteristic.<a name=4:11></a> On Jesus the Holy Ghost descended in the shape of a dove, because He was not to make His voice heard in the streets, nor break the bruised reed, nor quench the smoking flax.<a name=4:12></a> But here it was the power of God in testimony, the word; which was like consuming fire, judging all that came before it.<a name=4:13></a> Nevertheless it was in grace, and was to go beyond the narrow limits of Jewish ordinances to proclaim the wonderful works of God to every tongue and nation under the sun.<a name=4:14></a> It was that mighty wind from heaven, which manifested itself to the disciples, and came upon them in the form of tongues of fire, each one divided into several.<a name=4:15></a> This marvel attracts the multitude; and the reality of this divine work is proved by the fact that persons from numerous countries hear these poor Galileans proclaim to them the wonderful works of God, each one in the language of the country whence he came up to Jerusalem.<a name=4:16></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#46:4">footnote</a></i>) The Jews, who did not understand these languages,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The character of this testimony will be remarked here.<a name=5:5></a> It is essentially that of Peter.<a name=5:6></a> It goes no farther than the affirmation of the fact, that He who had been rejected by the Jews is made in heaven Lord and Christ.<a name=5:7></a> It begins with Jesus known of the Jews on earth, and establishes the truth of His being raised again, and exalted to the position of Lord.<a name=5:8></a> God has done this.<a name=5:9></a> The apostle does not even proclaim Him as the Son of God.<a name=5:10></a> We shall see that, if it is not done by Peter in the Acts, Paul on the contrary does it from the first moment of his conversion.<a name=5:11></a> Peter states the result at that moment in power, and does not speak of the kingdom.<a name=5:12></a> He only reminds them that the Spirit was promised in the last days, and alludes to the terrible day of the coming judgment, which would be preceded by alarming signs and wonders.<a name=5:13></a> Without speaking of the fulfilment of the promise of the kingdom, the time of which the Father had kept secret, he puts the fact of the gift of the Holy Ghost in connection with the responsibility of Israel, to whom God still acted in grace, by preaching to them a glorified Christ, and by giving them proofs of His glory in the gift of the Holy Ghost, made sensible to all.<a name=5:14></a> This is the presence of the Holy Ghost according to <a href="../bible/John.htm#15:26">John  15:26</a>, 27.<a name=5:15></a> The testimony as a whole, however, is founded on and carries out the mission of <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24">Luke  24</a>.<a name=5:16></a> Only in Luke we have nothing of baptism.<a name=5:17></a> See <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:47">Luke  24:47</a> - 49, to which this fully corresponds.<a name=5:18></a> The testimony was addressed to the Jews; nevertheless it was not confined to them,(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#46:5">footnote</a></i>) and it was separative.<a name=5:19></a> "Separate

		The result of this ineffable gift is related to us.<a name=6:15></a> It was not merely a moral change, but a power which set aside all the motives that individualised those who had received it, by uniting them as one soul and in one mind.<a name=6:16></a> They continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine; they were in communion with each other and the apostles; they broke bread; they spent their time in prayer.<a name=6:17></a> The sense of God's presence was powerful among them; and many signs and wonders were wrought by the hands of the apostles.<a name=6:18></a> They were united in the closest bonds; no man called anything his own, but all divided their possessions with those that needed.<a name=6:19></a> They were daily in the temple, the public resort of Israel for religious exercises, whilst having their own apart -- breaking bread at home daily.<a name=6:20></a> They ate with joy and gladness of heart, praising God, and having favour with all the people around them.<a name=6:21></a>

		Thus the assembly was formed; and the Lord added to it daily the remnant of Israel, who were to be saved from the judgments that should fall on a nation which had rejected the Son of God, their Messiah; and, thank God, from yet deeper ruin.<a name=7:1></a> God brought into the assembly -- thus owned of Him by the presence of the Holy Ghost -- those whom He spared in Israel.<a name=7:2></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#46:7">footnote</a></i>) A new order of things had commenced, marked by the presence of the Holy Ghost.<a name=7:3></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#46:7">footnote</a></i>) Here was found the presence and the house of God, although the old order of things still existed until the execution of judgment upon it.<a name=7:4></a>

		We have seen (<b>chapter 4</b>) the address which God, in His grace, sent to Israel by the mouth of Peter.<a name=9:5></a> We shall now see, not only the reception (already noticed) which it met with from the rulers of the people, but the deliberate answer of their inmost heart, as we may call it.<a name=9:6></a> On the morrow the rulers, the elders, and the scribes assemble at Jerusalem, together with Annas and his kindred; and, setting the apostles in their midst, they demand by what power or in what name they have wrought this miracle on the impotent man.<a name=9:7></a> Peter, full of the Holy Ghost, declares -- announcing it to all Israel, and with the utmost readiness and entire boldness -- that it was by Jesus, whom they had crucified, and whom God had raised from the dead.<a name=9:8></a> Thus the question between God and the rulers of Israel was very formally stated, and that by the Spirit of God.<a name=9:9></a> Jesus was the stone rejected by them, the builders, which had become the head of the corner.<a name=9:10></a> Salvation could nowhere else be found.<a name=9:11></a> No carefulness not to offend, with regard to the adversaries and the rulers; with the people, as such, ignorant and misled, everything to win them.<a name=9:12></a> The council recognised them as former companions of Christ: the man who had been healed was there.<a name=9:13></a> What could they say or do in the face of the multitude who had witnessed the miracle?<a name=9:14></a> They could only exhibit a will in decided opposition to the Lord and His testimony, and yield to the public opinion, which was necessary to their own importance, by which too they were governed.<a name=9:15></a> With threats they commanded the apostles to teach no more in the name of Jesus.<a name=9:16></a> We may remark here, that Satan had Sadducean instruments arrayed against the doctrine of the resurrection, as he had Pharisees as suited instruments against a living Christ.<a name=9:17></a> We must expect the well-ordered opposition of Satan against the truth.<a name=9:18></a>

		Peter and John return to their own company, for a separate people who knew each other was formed; and all, moved by the Holy Ghost (for it was there that God dwelt by His Spirit, not now in the temple), lift up their voice to God, the Governor of all things, to acknowledge that this opposition of the rulers was but the accomplishment of the word and the counsels and the purposes of God.<a name=10:4></a> These threatenings were but the occasion of asking God to manifest His power in connection with the name of Jesus.<a name=10:5></a> In a word, the world (including the Jews, who formed a part of it in their opposition) had stood up against Jesus, the Servant of God, and opposed itself to the testimony rendered to Him.<a name=10:6></a> The Holy Ghost is the strength of this testimony, whether in the courage of those who bore witness (verse 8), or in His presence in the assembly (verse 31), or in the energy of service (verse 33), or in the fruits that are again produced among the saints with a power which makes it manifest that the Holy Ghost has dominion in their hearts over all the motives that influence man, making them walk by those of which He is the source.<a name=10:7></a> It is the energy of the Spirit in the presence of opposition, as before it was His natural fruit in those among whom He dwelt.<a name=10:8></a> Fresh persons sell their goods, and lay their price at the apostles' feet; among others, a man whom the Holy Ghost takes pleasure in distinguishing -- Barnabas, from the island of Cyprus.<a name=10:9></a>

		To sum up this chapter demonstrates, on one side, the condition of the Jews, their rejection of the testimony which was addressed to them in grace; and on the other, the power of the Holy Ghost and God's presence and guidance elsewhere, namely, in the midst of the disciples.<a name=10:10></a>

		These conflicts will be unfolded to us in the Epistles, as well as that ardent heart which -- while embracing in its thoughts all the revealed counsels of God, and putting each part in its place, and embracing in its affections the whole of the work and of the assembly of God -- could equally concentrate its whole energy of thought on a single important point, and of affection on a poor slave whom grace had given to him in his chains.<a name=53:7></a> The vessel of the Spirit, Paul shines with a heavenly light throughout the whole work of the gospel.<a name=53:8></a> He condescends at Jerusalem, thunders in Galatia when souls were being perverted, leads the apostles to decide for the liberty of the Gentiles, and uses all liberty himself to be as a Jew to the Jews, and as without law to those that had no law, as not under law, but always subject to Christ.<a name=53:9></a> Yet how difficult to maintain the height of life and of spiritual revelation, in the midst of so many opposing tendencies!<a name=53:10></a> He was also "void of offence".<a name=53:11></a> Nothing within hindered his communion with God, whence he drew his strength to be faithful among men.<a name=53:12></a> He could say, and none but he, "Be ye imitators of me, as I am of Christ".<a name=53:13></a> Thus also he could say, "I endure all things for the elect's sake, that they may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory", words which would not be improper in the Lord's mouth -- in a more exalted sense doubtless, because He endured for Paul himself the wrath that would have been his eternal condemnation -- yet words which bring out the remarkable position of this man of God, as the vessel of the Holy Ghost by whom he was

		The assemblies were consolidated over a pretty large extent of country, and in divers places at least had taken the form of a regularly ordered institution.<a name=56:1></a> Elders were established and recognised.<a name=56:2></a> The apostle could send for them to come to him.<a name=56:3></a> His authority also was acknowledged on their part.<a name=56:4></a> He speaks of his ministry as a past thing -- solemn thought!<a name=56:5></a> but he takes them to witness not only that he had preached the truth to them, but a truth that spoke to their conscience; setting them before God on the one hand, and on the other presenting to them Him in whom God made Himself known, and in whom He communicated all the fulness of grace on their behalf -- Jesus, the object of their faith, the Saviour of their souls.<a name=56:6></a> He had done this through trouble and through difficulty, in face of the unprincipled opposition of the Jews who had rejected the Anointed One, but in accordance with the grace that rose above all this evil and declared salvation to the Jews, and going beyond these limits (because it was grace) addressed itself to the Gentiles, to all men, as sinners and responsible to God.<a name=56:7></a> Paul had done this, not with the pride of a teacher, but with the humility and the perseverance of love.<a name=56:8></a> He desired also to finish his ministry, and to fail in nothing that Jesus had committed to him.<a name=56:9></a> And now he was going to Jerusalem, feeling bound in spirit to do so, not knowing what would befall him, but warned by the Holy Ghost that bonds and afflictions awaited him.<a name=56:10></a> With regard to themselves, he knew his ministry was ended, and that he should see their face no more.<a name=56:11></a> Henceforth responsibility would specially rest upon them.<a name=56:12></a>

		Thus what the Holy Ghost here sets before us is, that now, when the detail of his work among the Gentiles to plant the gospel is related as one entire scene among Jews and Gentiles, he bids adieu to the work; in order to leave those whom he had gathered together in a new position, and in a certain sense to themselves.<a name=56:13></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#46:56">footnote</a></i>) It is a discourse which marks the cessation of one phase of the assembly -- that of apostolic labours -- and the entrance into another -- its responsibility to stand fast now that those labours had ceased, the service of the elders whom "the Holy Ghost had made overseers", and at the same time the dangers and difficulties that would attend the cessation of

		The first remark that flows from the consideration of this discourse is, that apostolic succession is entirely denied by it.<a name=57:2></a> Owing to the absence of the apostle various difficulties would arise, and there would be no one in his place to meet or to prevent these difficulties.<a name=57:3></a> Successor therefore he had none.<a name=57:4></a> In the second place the fact appears that, this energy which bridled the spirit of evil, once away, devouring wolves from without, and teachers of perverse things from within, would lift up their heads and attack the simplicity and the happiness of the assembly, which would be harassed by the efforts of Satan without possessing apostolic energy to withstand them.<a name=57:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This testimony of Paul's is of the highest importance with regard to the whole ecclesiastical system.<a name=57:6></a> The attention of the elders who are left in charge is directed elsewhere than to present apostolical care (as having no longer this resource, or anything that officially replaced it), in order that the assembly might be kept in peace and sheltered from evil.<a name=57:7></a> It was their part to care for the assembly in these circumstances.<a name=57:8></a> In the next place, that which was principally to be done for the hindrance of evil was to shepherd the flock, and to watch, whether over themselves or over the flock, for that purpose.<a name=57:9></a> He reminds them how he had himself exhorted them night and day with tears.<a name=57:10></a> Let them therefore watch.<a name=57:11></a> He then commends them, neither to Timothy, nor to a bishop, but -- in a way that sets aside all official resource -- to God, and to the word of His grace which was able to build them up and assure them of the inheritance.<a name=57:12></a> This was where he left the assembly; that which it did afterwards is not my subject here.<a name=57:13></a> If John came later to work in these parts, it was a great favour from God, but it changed nothing in the position officially.<a name=57:14></a> His labours (with the exception of the warnings to the seven assemblies in the Apocalypse, where judgment is in question) regarded the individual life, its character, and that which sustained it.<a name=57:15></a>

		We may remark here a leading feature in this book which has been little noticed; that is, the development of the enmity of the Jews, bringing on their final rejection, such as they were.<a name=58:8></a> The Acts ends with the last case presented; the work in the midst of that people is left in oblivion, and that of Paul occupies the whole scene in the historical narrative given by the Spirit.<a name=58:9></a> The antagonism of the Jews to the manifestation of the assembly, which took their place and blotted out the distinction between them and the Gentiles, by bringing in heaven and full sovereign grace in contrast with law, which while universal in its direction was given to a distinct people (grace of which the sinner availed himself by faith) -- this antagonism, presenting itself at every step in the career of the apostle, although he acted with all possible circumspection, is aroused in its full intensity at Jerusalem, its natural centre, and manifests itself by violence and by efforts made with the Gentiles for the purpose of cutting off Paul from the earth.<a name=58:10></a> This rendered the apostle's position very serious with regard to the Gentiles at Jerusalem -- a city the more jealous of its religious importance from having in fact under Roman bondage lost the reality of it, through its being transformed into a spirit of rebellion against the authority which crippled it.<a name=58:11></a>

		After the history of Christianity, viewed as connected with Judaism (in reference to the promises and their fulfilment in the Messiah), we find Paul in three different positions.<a name=58:12></a> First, condescending, for the purpose of conciliation, to take account of that which still existed at Jerusalem, and even addressing the Jews everywhere in their synagogues, as having administratively the first right to hear the gospel ("To the Jew first and then to the Greek") for Jesus was the minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to fulfil the promises made to the fathers.<a name=58:13></a> In this respect he never failed, and he establishes

		THE EPISTLES: INTRODUCTION
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the Epistles, we find the exposition of the result of that glorious work of grace, by which man is placed on entirely new ground with God, in reconciliation with Him; as well as the development of the counsels of God in Christ, according to which this new world is established and ordered.<a name=78:1></a> In giving this exposition of the ways of God in connection with the work which is their basis, the perfect efficacy of the work itself, and the order of our relations with God, are plainly set forth; so that the whole system, the whole plan of God, and the way in which it was put in execution, are presented.<a name=78:2></a> And in doing this, that which man is, that which God is, that which eternal life is, are clearly put before us.<a name=78:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The death and resurrection of Christ, as well as His exaltation to the right hand of God, form the centre of all this instruction.<a name=78:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are three great divisions in this instruction, which are connected in general with the instrument used of God in the communication of each part.<a name=78:5></a> 1st.<a name=78:6></a> The counsels of God, which are developed by Paul in connection with the revelation of true righteousness before God, the ground on which a man can be truly righteous before God -- God's righteousness, man being a sinner.<a name=78:7></a> 2nd.<a name=78:8></a> The life of God, eternal life manifested and imparted.<a name=78:9></a> This is in John's epistle.<a name=78:10></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#46:78">footnote</a></i>) 3rd.<a name=78:11></a> Christian life on the earth, in following a risen Christ.<a name=78:12></a> This we find in the Epistle of Peter, in connection with God's government of the world as such: the Christian is a pilgrim.<a name=78:13></a> There are also James and Jude.<a name=78:14></a> The first presents moral life -- the life of faith on earth -- as the true demonstration to men of our faith, and, in particular, of practical faith in Christ as well as in God,

		who answers our requests and our wants.<a name=79:1></a> On this account, while clearly and distinctly recognising faith in Christ, and our being begotten by the mighty grace of God through His word, this epistle scarcely rises in fact above such life as could have manifested and developed itself at any period whatsoever in a believer; only that it was the Christian, born of God, who now exemplified it, and that thus it was the law of liberty, because the new nature and the will of God ran together, and both were fully revealed in Christ.<a name=79:2></a> Thus the Epistle of James is linked with the synagogue, and with Christians still in connection with Judaism, as we have seen them historically at Jerusalem with James at their head.<a name=79:3></a> The Epistle does not go beyond that position.<a name=79:4></a> It is the last testimony rendered to Israel looked at as the people of God, while at the same time distinguishing the quickened remnant who had faith in Christ, although they were not yet separated from the nation.<a name=79:5></a> Our habits of thought, founded not on imposed law without reason, but upon a much more complete development of Christianity (a development which was the manifestation of counsels much more ancient than the Jewish nation, for they were the eternal counsels of God), make it difficult for us to apprehend this form of the truth -- a form in which it is connected with that which, because of the promises made to Israel, was historically its cradle here below.<a name=79:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		If we have rightly understood the history of the Acts, it will make the position of believers, as we find it in the Epistle of James, much more intelligible to us.<a name=79:7></a> The Epistle is a correction of profession without life, and most valuable in this respect.<a name=79:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Jude has a very different character.<a name=79:9></a> It is not the cradle of Christianity, or of the assembly on earth: it is its decay and its death here below.<a name=79:10></a> It does not keep its first estate.<a name=79:11></a> This Epistle resembles a part of the second by Peter; but the latter speaks of the judgment brought in by the general government of God; Jude, of the fall of that which has had its existence since Pentecost under the eye of God, as responsible for the maintenance of the glory of His grace on the earth -- a fall which, with regard to the present state of things, brings on the judgment of which Peter speaks, and which he carries on even to the dissolution of the earth and its elements.<a name=79:12></a> The evil that had already begun in its earliest germs gave rise to this development in Jude, and to the distinction of the true assembly, or at least of its members, who would be presented in glory before the

	<div class="paragraph">
		A more complete and more precise development will be found in studying the Epistles themselves.<a name=80:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us now consider a little the epistles of Paul himself.<a name=81:6></a> They have more than one character, whilst all displaying that spirit gifted from on high, which expatiates on the wide range of the thoughts of God, and in its wonderful energy can enter at the same time into every detail, even into those of individual life; that knows how to place itself exactly in the relations of a fugitive slave with his master, in view of grace, and to set forth with divine clearness all the counsels by which the Father glorifies His Son, by making Him the centre of all His purposes, of the system which results from the exercises of all His power.<a name=81:7></a>

		The care of the assemblies, the development of the counsels of God, the exercise of brotherly affection, have each their place in his thoughts and his labours; while he is often forced to develop the truth in striving against errors which rend his heart, whether he thinks of the Christ whom they dishonour, and of the truth -- the instrument of salvation -- which they undermine; or whether he remembers the dear redeemed ones of Christ who are troubled by these errors, perhaps turned aside from the true path by them.<a name=81:8></a>

		The Epistle to the Romans is well placed at the head of all the others, as laying the foundations, in a systematic way, of the relations of man with God; reconciling at the same time this universal truth of man's position, first in responsibility, and secondly in grace, with the special promises made to the Jews.<a name=82:1></a> It also establishes the great principles of christian practice, the morality, not of man, but that which is the fruit of the light and revelation given by Christianity.<a name=82:2></a> It is important to see that it always views the Christian as in this world.<a name=82:3></a> He is justified and has life in Christ, but is here, and not viewed as risen with Him.<a name=82:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The following is, I believe, the arrangement of the epistle.<a name=82:5></a> After some introductory verses, which open his subject, several of which are of the deepest importance and furnish the key to the whole teaching of the epistle and man's real state with God (chapter 1: 1 - 17), the apostle (to the end of chapter 3: 20(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#46:82">footnote</a></i>)) shews man to be utterly corrupt and lost, in all the circumstances in which he stands.<a name=82:6></a> Without law, it was unbridled sin; with philosophy, it was judging evil and committing it; under law, it was breaking the law, while boasting of its possession, and dishonouring the name of Him with whose glory those who possessed it were (so to say) identified, by having received from Him that law as His people.<a name=82:7></a> From chapter 3: 21 to the end of chapter 8 we find the remedy plainly set forth in two parts.<a name=82:8></a> In chapter 3: 21 to the end of the chapter, in a general way, through faith the blood of Christ is the answer to all the sin which the apostle has just been describing; afterwards, in chapter 4, resurrection, the seal of Christ's work, and the witness of its efficacy for our justification.<a name=82:9></a> All this meets the responsibility

		Having pointed out the source, the Author of the gospel, the One whom it thus reveals in His grace, the apostle presents the connection between this gospel and the dealings of God which historically preceded it -- its promulgation here below, and at the same time its own proper object; that is to say, its subject properly so called, and the place held with regard to it by that which preceded it (the order of things which those to whom they belonged sought to maintain as a substantive and independent system by rejecting the gospel).<a name=85:10></a> He here introduces that which preceded, not as a subject of controversy, but in its true character, to enforce the testimony of the gospel (anticipating objections, which are thus solved beforehand).<a name=85:11></a>

		Was then this righteousness for the circumcision only?<a name=99:6></a> Now our thesis is, that God counted Abraham to be righteous by faith.<a name=99:7></a> But was he circumcised when this took place?<a name=99:8></a> Not so; he was uncircumcised.<a name=99:9></a> Righteousness then is by faith, and for the uncircumcised through faith -- a testimony that was overwhelming to a Jew, because Abraham was the beau ideal to which all his ideas of excellence and of privilege referred.<a name=99:10></a> Circumcision was only a seal to the righteousness by faith which Abraham possessed in uncircumcision, that he might be the father of all believers who were in the same state of uncircumcision, that righteousness might be imputed to them also; and the father of circumcision -- that is, the first model of a people truly set apart for God -- not only with regard to the circumcised, but to all those who should walk in the steps of his faith when uncircumcised.<a name=99:11></a> For, after all, the promise that he should be heir of the world was not made to Abraham nor to his seed in connection with the law, but with righteousness by faith.<a name=99:12></a> For if they who are on the principle of law are heirs, the faith by which Abraham received it is vain, and the promise made of none effect(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#46:99">footnote</a></i>); for, on the contrary, the law produces wrath -- and that is a very different thing from bringing into the enjoyment of a promise -- for where there is no law there is no transgression.<a name=99:13></a> Observe, he does not say there is no sin; but where there is no commandment, there is none to violate.<a name=99:14></a> Now, the law being given to a sinner, wrath is necessarily the consequence of its imposition.<a name=99:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This principle admitted the Gentiles; but here it is established with regard to the Jews themselves or rather with regard to the ways of God, in such a manner as to exclude the law as a means of obtaining the inheritance of God.<a name=100:4></a> The consequence with regard to Gentiles believing the gospel is stated in verse 16, "Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace, to the end that the promise might be sure to all the seed" of Abraham to whom the promise was made; not to that only which was under the law, but to all that had the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all before God, as it is written, "I have made thee a father of many nations".<a name=100:5></a>

		Another element is now introduced.<a name=100:8></a> Humanly speaking, the fulfilment of the promise was impossible, for in that respect both Abraham and Sarah were as dead, and the promise must be believed in against all hope, resting on the almighty power of Him who raises the dead, and calls things that are not as though they were.<a name=100:9></a> This was Abraham's faith.<a name=100:10></a> He believed the promise that he should be the father of many nations, because God had spoken, counting on the power of God, thus glorifying Him, without calling in question anything that He had said by looking at circumstances; therefore this also was counted to him for righteousness.<a name=100:11></a> He glorified God according to what God was.<a name=100:12></a> Now, this was not written for his sake alone the same faith shall be imputed to us also for righteousness -- faith in God as having raised up Jesus from the dead.<a name=100:13></a> It is not here faith in Jesus, but in Him who came in power into the domain of death, where Jesus lay because of our sins, and brought Him forth by His power, the mighty activity of the love of God who brought Him -- who had already borne all the punishment of our sins -- out from under all their consequences; so that, by believing God who has done this, we

	<div class="paragraph">
		The key to all this doctrine of the apostle's, and that which unites holy practice, the christian life, with absolute grace and eternal deliverance from condemnation, is the new position entirely apart from sin, which death gives to us, being alive in Christ now before God.<a name=122:17></a> The power of God, the glory of the Father, the operation of the Spirit, are found acting in the resurrection of Christ, and placing Him, who had borne our sins and been made sin for us, in a new position beyond sin and death before God.<a name=122:18></a> And by faith I have part in His death, I participate in this life.<a name=122:19></a>

		Observe here, that the Spirit is designated in three ways: the Spirit of God, in contrast with sinful flesh, with the natural man, the Spirit of Christ, the formal character of the life which is the expression of His power (this is the Spirit acting in man according to the perfection of the divine thoughts); the Spirit of Him that raised up the man Christ from among the dead.<a name=129:13></a> Here it is the perfect and final deliverance of the body itself by the power of God acting through His Spirit.<a name=129:14></a> Thus then we have got the full answer to the question, "Who shall deliver me?<a name=129:15></a>" We see that christian life in its true character -- that of the Spirit, depends on redemption.<a name=129:16></a> It is by virtue of redemption that the Spirit is present with us.<a name=129:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But to proceed with our chapter.<a name=130:13></a> The apostle concludes thus exposition of the spiritual life, which gives liberty to the soul, by presenting the Christian as being thus a debtor, not to the flesh, which has now no longer any right over us.<a name=130:14></a> Yet he will not say directly that we are debtors to the Spirit.<a name=130:15></a> It is indeed our duty to live after the Spirit; but if we said that we are debtors, it would be putting man under a higher law the fulfilment of which would thereby be yet more impossible to him.<a name=130:16></a> The Spirit was the strength to live, and that through the affections which He imparts -- not the obligation to have them If we live after the flesh, we are going to die; but if by the Spirit we mortify the deeds of the body, we shall live.<a name=130:17></a> The evil is there, but strength is there to overcome it.<a name=130:18></a> This is the effect according to the nature of God and of the flesh.<a name=130:19></a> But there is another side of the subject -- the relationship which this presence and operation of the Spirit gives us towards God Instead then of saying "legal debtors to the Spirit", the Spirit Himself is our power, by which we mortify the flesh and thus are sure of living with God; and we are the sons of God, being led of the Spirit.<a name=130:20></a> For we have not received a spirit of bondage to be again in fear (that was the condition of the faithful under the law), but a Spirit that answers to our adoption to be sons of God, and this is its power -- a Spirit by which we cry, "Abba, Father".<a name=130:21></a>

		The apostle, we have seen, speaks of the Spirit in us as of a certain character, a condition in which we are, because He instils Himself into our whole moral being -- our thoughts, affections, object, action; or, rather, He creates them; He is their source; He acts by producing them.<a name=131:7></a> Thus He is practically a Spirit of adoption, because He produces in our souls all that appertains to this relationship.<a name=131:8></a> If He acts, our thoughts, our affections, act also; we are in the enjoyment of this relationship by virtue of this action.<a name=131:9></a> But having thus identified (and it could not be otherwise) the Holy Ghost with all that He produces in us, for it is thus that the Christian knows Him (the world does not receive Him because it does not see Him, nor know Him; but ye know Him because He is with you, and dwells in you: precious state!<a name=131:10></a>) -- when the Holy Ghost Himself is the source of our being and of our thoughts, according to the counsels of God in Christ and the position which Christ has acquired for us -- the apostle, I repeat, having spoken of the Spirit as characterising our moral existence, is careful to distinguish Him as a person, a really distinct existence.<a name=131:11></a> The

		It is not therefore creation only which groans, being in bondage to corruption in consequence of the sin of man; but we ourselves, who have the first-fruits of the Spirit -- which God has given in anticipation of the accomplishment of His promises in the last days, and which connects us with heaven -- we also groan, while waiting for the redemption of our body to take possession of the glory prepared for us.<a name=134:5></a> But it is because the Holy Ghost who is in us takes part in our sorrow and helps us in our infirmities; dwelling in us, He pleads in the midst of this misery by groans, which do not express themselves in words.<a name=134:6></a> The sense of the evil that oppresses us and all around us is there; and the more conscious we are of the blessing and of the liberty of the glory, the more sensible are we of the weight of the misery brought in by sin.<a name=134:7></a> We do not know what to ask for as a remedy; but the heart expresses its sorrow as Jesus did at the grave of Lazarus -- at least in our little measure.<a name=134:8></a> Now this is not the selfishness of the flesh which does not like to suffer; it is the affection of the Spirit.<a name=134:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Spirit, then, is the witness in us that we are children, and thereby heirs; and He takes part in the sorrowful experience that we are linked with creation by our bodies, and becomes the source of affections in us, which express themselves in groans that are divine in their character as well as human, and which have the value of His own intercession.<a name=135:3></a> And this grace shews itself in connection with our ignorance and weakness.<a name=135:4></a> Moreover, if after all we know not what to ask for, we know that everything works together under God's own hand for our greatest good(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#46:135">footnote</a></i>) (verse 28).<a name=135:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We have advanced here to a fuller experimental state than in chapter 5, following on what unfolds the exercises of a soul learning what it is in itself, and the operation of the law, and what it is to be dead with Christ, and to be alive through and associated with Him, and coming out, as in Him before God, with the consciousness of God for it.<a name=137:11></a> But there is in chapter 5 more of the simple grace of God, what He is in His own blessed nature and thoughts, as above sin, towards the sinner.<a name=137:12></a> We have the Christian's place more fully with God here, but what God is simply in grace more fully in chapter 5.<a name=137:13></a> Chapter 5 is more what God is thus known through the work of Christ; chapter 8 more our place in Christ before Him.<a name=137:14></a> Blessed to have both!<a name=137:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There remained one important question to be considered, namely, how this salvation, common to Jew and Gentile, both alienated from God -- this doctrine that there was no difference -- was to be reconciled with the special promises made to the Jews.<a name=137:16></a> The proof of their guilt and ruin under the law did not touch the promises of a faithful God.<a name=137:17></a> Was the apostle going to do away with these to place the Gentiles on the same footing?<a name=137:18></a> They did not fail also to accuse the apostle of having despised his nation and its privileges.<a name=137:19></a> Chapters 9, 10 and 11 reply to this question; and, with rare and admirable perfection, set forth the position of Israel with respect to God and to the gospel.<a name=137:20></a> This reply opens, in itself, a wide door to intelligence in the ways of God.<a name=137:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle begins by affirming his deep interest in the blessing of Israel.<a name=137:22></a> Their condition was a source of constant grief to him.<a name=137:23></a> Far from despising them, he loved them as much as Moses had done.<a name=137:24></a> He had wished to be anathema from Christ for them.<a name=137:25></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#46:137">footnote</a></i>) He acknowledged that all the privileges

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first place, this truth displayed itself in the bosom of Abraham's own family.<a name=138:3></a> The Jews alleged their exclusive right to the promises in virtue of their descent from him, and to have their promises by right, and exclusively, because they were descended from him.<a name=138:4></a> But they are not all Israel which are of Israel.<a name=138:5></a> Neither because they were of the seed of Abraham were they therefore all children.<a name=138:6></a> For in that case Ishmael must have been received; and the Jews would by no means hear of that.<a name=138:7></a> God then was sovereign.<a name=138:8></a> But it might be alleged that Hagar was a slave.<a name=138:9></a> But Esau's case excluded even this saving thought.<a name=138:10></a> The same mother bore both sons of one father, and God had chosen Jacob and rejected Esau.<a name=138:11></a> It was thus on the principle of sovereignty and election, that God had decided that the seed should be called in the family of Isaac.<a name=138:12></a> And before Esau and Jacob were born, God declared that the elder should serve the younger.<a name=138:13></a> The Jews must then admit God's sovereignty on this point.<a name=138:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Was God then unrighteous?<a name=138:15></a> He plainly declared His sovereignty for good to Moses as a principle.<a name=138:16></a> It is the first of all rights.<a name=138:17></a> But in what case had He exercised this right?<a name=138:18></a> In a case that concerned that right of Israel to blessing, of which the Jews sought to avail themselves.<a name=138:19></a> All Israel would have been cut off, if God had dealt in righteousness; there was nothing but the sovereignty of God which could be a door of escape.<a name=138:20></a> God retreated into His sovereignty in order to spare whom He would, and so had spared Israel (justice would have condemned them all alike, gathered round the golden calf which they set up to worship) -- this, on the side of mercy; on that of judgment, Pharaoh served for an example.<a name=138:21></a> The enemy of God, and of His people, he had treated the claims of God with contempt, exalting himself proudly against Him -- "Who is Jehovah, that I should obey him?<a name=138:22></a> I will not let his people go".<a name=138:23></a> Pharaoh being in this state, Jehovah uses him to give an example of His wrath and judgment.<a name=138:24></a> So that He shews mercy to whom He will, and hardens whom He will.<a name=138:25></a> Man complains of it, as he does of the grace that justifies freely.<a name=138:26></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The doctrine established, then, is the sovereignty of God in derogation of the pretensions of the Jews to the exclusive enjoyment of all the promises, as being descended from Abraham; for, among his descendants, more than one had been excluded by the exercise of this sovereignty; and it was nothing less than its exercise which, on the occasion of the golden calf, had spared those who pretended to the right of descent.<a name=139:12></a> It was necessary therefore that the Jew should recognise it, or else that he should admit the Idumeans in full right, as well as the Ishmaelites, and renounce it himself, the families of Moses and Joshua alone perhaps excepted.<a name=139:13></a> But if such was the sovereignty of God, He would now exercise it in favour of the Gentiles, as well as Jews.<a name=139:14></a> He called whom He would.<a name=139:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But further passages from the prophets amply confirm the judgment which the apostle pronounces by the Spirit on the Jews.<a name=140:3></a> Isaiah declared formally that, if God had not left them a little remnant, they would have been as Sodom and Gomorrah; numerous as the people were, a little remnant only should be saved; for God was cutting the work short in judgment on the earth.<a name=140:4></a> And here was the state of things morally: the Gentiles had obtained the righteousness which they had not sought, had obtained it by faith; and Israel, seeking to obtain it by the fulfilment of a law, had not attained to righteousness.<a name=140:5></a> Why?<a name=140:6></a> Because they sought it not by faith, but by works of law.<a name=140:7></a> For they had stumbled at the stumbling-stone (that is, at Christ), as it is written, "I lay in Sion a stumbling-stone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth in him shall not be ashamed".<a name=140:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having touched on this subject, the apostle, who deeply loved his nation as the people of God, pours out his heart with respect of the doctrine which was a stumbling-stone to them.<a name=140:9></a> His desire, the aim of his heart's affection, was their salvation.<a name=140:10></a> The object of his affections, they were clothed in his eyes with their zeal for God, ignorant as it was; ignorant, alas!<a name=140:11></a> on the side of that which God taught.<a name=140:12></a> Being ignorant of God's righteousness, they sought in their zeal to establish their own righteousness, and did not submit themselves to that of God.<a name=140:13></a> For Christ is the end of law for righteousness to every believer.<a name=140:14></a> There was found the righteousness of God, there the stumblingstone to Israel.<a name=140:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nevertheless the apostle establishes his argument clearly and firmly.<a name=140:16></a> He establishes it on his own part; but Deuteronomy supplies him with an unexpected proof of the great principle.<a name=140:17></a> He quotes a passage from that book which speaks on the subject of Israel's condition, when they should have broken the law and be suffering its consequences.<a name=140:18></a> "Secret things", the lawgiver had said, "belong to our God; but those that are revealed" are for the people.<a name=140:19></a> That is to say, the law was given as a condition to the enjoyment of the blessing, plainly and positively; what God might do in grace, when Israel should be under the consequences of the broken law, remained in the secrecy of His supreme will.<a name=140:20></a> Upon this, however, another principle is distinctly revealed, namely, that
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	<div class="paragraph">
		when the fulfilment of the law was impossible, and when Israel had been driven out of their land for having broken it, if then their heart turned to God in that far country, He would accept them.<a name=141:1></a> It was all over with the law as a condition of relationship with God.<a name=141:2></a> Israel was driven out according to the chapter we are looking at (<a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#30">Deuteronomy  30</a>) -- was Lo-ammi, no longer the people of God.<a name=141:3></a> The testimony of God was nevertheless addressed to them: they might turn to Him in spirit, and by faith.<a name=141:4></a> It was no longer the law, it was faith.<a name=141:5></a> But, says the apostle, if so, it is Christ who is its object.<a name=141:6></a> No Jew would have denied that the testimony of God was the hope of every true Israelite when all was ruined.<a name=141:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This passage then in Deuteronomy -- when Moses has done with the law, and has supposed other counsels of God, and on them founds the principle of turning in heart to God when all is over with regard to the law, and Israel is in a place where it would be impossible to keep it, being in captivity among the Gentiles -- this passage has remarkable significance in the argument of the apostle; and its being quoted is an extraordinary proof, that in his reasonings it is the Holy Ghost who acts.<a name=141:8></a> It is the apostle who introduces Christ; but the combination of the truths of the different positions of Israel, of the law, and of the return in heart when they were lost under the law -- a combination of which Christ was the key-stone and alone could be -- exhibits a comprehensive view of the oneness of all God's ways, morally and in His dispensations, of which the Spirit of God alone is capable, and which evidently expresses His thoughts.<a name=141:9></a> See <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#29">Deuteronomy  29</a>(at the end) and 30.<a name=141:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The word of faith then set forth as being the hope of Israel, was that which the apostle announced -- that if any one confessed with his mouth the Lord Jesus, and believed in his heart that God had raised Him from the dead, he should be saved.<a name=141:11></a> Precious, simple, and positive assertion!<a name=141:12></a> and borne out, if that were needed, by the testimony of the Old Testament: "Whosoever believeth in him shall not be ashamed".<a name=141:13></a> The words heart and mouth are in contrast with the law.<a name=141:14></a> In the case Deuteronomy supposes, Israel could not fulfil the law; the word of their God, Moses told them, could be in their heart and in their mouth.<a name=141:15></a> Thus now for the Jew (as for every one) it was the belief of the heart.<a name=141:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Moreover thus faith is manifested by the proof it gives of its sincerity -- by confession of the name of Christ.<a name=142:8></a> If some one were convinced that Jesus is the Christ, and refused to confess Him, his conviction would evidently be his greater condemnation.<a name=142:9></a> The faith of the heart produces the confession of the mouth; the confession of the mouth is the counterproof of the sincerity of the faith, and of honesty, in the sense of the claim which the Lord has upon us in grace.<a name=142:10></a> It is the testimony which God requires at the outset.<a name=142:11></a> It is to sound the trumpet on earth in face of the enemy.<a name=142:12></a> It is to say that Christ has conquered, and that everything belongs in right to Him.<a name=142:13></a> It is a confession which brings in God in answer to the name of Jesus.<a name=142:14></a> It is not that which brings in righteousness, but it is the public acknowledgment of Christ, and thus gives expression to the faith by which there is participation in the righteousness of God, so that it may be said, 'He believes in Christ unto salvation; he has the faith that justifies'.<a name=142:15></a>

		I have entered here a little more into detail, because this is a point on which the human heart perplexes itself; and perplexes itself so much the more because it is sincere, as long as there is any unbelief and self-righteousness remaining.<a name=142:16></a> It is impossible that an awakened soul should not feel the necessity of having the heart set right and turned to God; and hence, not submitting to the righteousness of God, he thinks to make the favour of God depend on the state of his own affections, whereas God loves us while we are yet sinners.<a name=142:17></a> The state of our

		affections is of all importance; but it supposes a relationship already existing, according to which we love.<a name=143:1></a> We love too because we are loved of God.<a name=143:2></a> Now His love has done something -- has done something according to our necessities, and according to the divine glory.<a name=143:3></a> It has given Jesus; and Jesus has accomplished what was required, in order that we may participate in divine righteousness; and thus He has placed every one who (acknowledging that he is a lost sinner) believes in Him, in the secure relationship of a child and of a justified soul before God, according to the perfection of the work of Christ.<a name=143:4></a> Salvation belongs to this soul according to the declaration of God Himself.<a name=143:5></a> Loved with such love, saved by such grace, enjoying such favour, let it cultivate affections suitable to the gift of Jesus, and to the knowledge it has of Him and of His goodness.<a name=143:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is evident that, if it is "whosoever" believes in Jesus, the Gentile comes in as well as the Jew.<a name=143:7></a> There is no difference; the same Lord is rich unto all that call upon Him.<a name=143:8></a> It is beautiful to see this form of expression, "There is no difference", repeated here.<a name=143:9></a> The apostle had used it before with the addition "for all have sinned".<a name=143:10></a> Sin puts all men on a level in ruin before God.<a name=143:11></a> But there is also no difference, "for the same Lord over all is rich unto all", for every one who calls upon His name shall be saved.<a name=143:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On this declaration, the apostle founds another argument; and by it he justifies the ways of God that were accomplished in his ministry.<a name=143:13></a> The Jewish scriptures declared that every one who called upon the name of the Lord should be saved.<a name=143:14></a> Now, the Jews acknowledged that the Gentiles did not know the name of the true and living God.<a name=143:15></a> It was needful therefore to proclaim Him, in order that they might call upon Him, and the whole ministry of the apostle was justified.<a name=143:16></a> Accordingly it was written, "How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the gospel of peace".<a name=143:17></a> For, in dealing with these questions among the Jews, he naturally rests on the authority of their own scriptures.<a name=143:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But he applies this principle for evangelisation to the Jews as well as to the Gentiles (for the law was not the announcement of good news).<a name=143:19></a> He quotes Isaiah to the same purpose.<a name=143:20></a> It was in a proclamation -- a truth thus publicly preached -- that Israel had not believed; so that there ought to be faith in a truth thus preached, in the word proclaimed.<a name=143:21></a> Verse 18 presents

	<div class="paragraph">
		some difficulty.<a name=144:1></a> It is certain that the apostle intends to explain that a proclamation of the truth on God's part had taken place.<a name=144:2></a> Israel was without excuse, for the report had even gone out everywhere, the words which announced God unto the ends of the earth.<a name=144:3></a> The testimony then was not confined to the Jews The Gentiles had heard it everywhere.<a name=144:4></a> This is plain.<a name=144:5></a> But does the apostle merely borrow the words (which in the passage quoted apply to the testimony of creation), or does he mean to speak of the testimony of nature itself?<a name=144:6></a> I believe that he uses the passage to shew that God had the Gentiles in view in His testimonies; that he wishes quietly to suggest this to the Jews by a quotation from their own scriptures, that not only have they, the Jews, heard, but that the testimony has gone everywhere, and that this was in the mind of God.<a name=144:7></a> Paul does not quote the passage as a prophecy of that which was taking place; he borrows the words, without that form of speech, to shew that this universal testimony was in the mind of God, whatever might be the means employed.<a name=144:8></a> And then, stating the thing with more precision for the Jew, he adds, Did not Israel know?<a name=144:9></a> Was not the nation apprised of this extension to the Gentiles, of the testimony of this proclamation of grace to them, of the reception of the testimony by the Gentiles, so as to bring them into relationship with God?<a name=144:10></a> Yes; Moses had already said, that God would provoke Israel to jealousy by a people without knowledge.<a name=144:11></a> And Isaiah had spoken boldly, formally declaring that God should be found by a nation that sought Him not; and to Israel, that all day long He had stretched forth His hands to a rebellious and gainsaying people; in a word, that the Gentiles should find Him, and Israel be perverse and disobedient.<a name=144:12></a> Thus, the testimony borne to their relative positions -- although the apostle approaches it gradually and quietly -- is distinct and formal: the Gentiles received; Israel at enmity.<a name=144:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hereupon the question is immediately raised, has God then rejected His people?<a name=144:14></a> To this chapter 11 is the answer.<a name=144:15></a> The apostle gives three proofs that it is by no means the case.<a name=144:16></a> Firstly, he is himself an Israelite; there is a remnant whom God has reserved, as in the days of Elias -- a proof of the constant favour of the Lord, of the interest He takes in His people, even when they are unfaithful; so that when the prophet, the most faithful and energetic among them, knew not where to find one who was true to God besides himself, God had His eyes upon the remnant who had not bowed the knee to Baal.<a name=144:17></a> Secondly,

	<div class="paragraph">
		That which the apostle, or rather which the Holy Ghost, says on this point requires to be looked at in more detail.<a name=145:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle, in quoting the case of Elias, shews that when Israel was in such a state that even Elias pleaded against them, yet God had not rejected them, He had reserved for Himself seven thousand men.<a name=145:6></a> This was the election of sovereign grace.<a name=145:7></a> It was the same thing now.<a name=145:8></a> But it was by grace, and not by works.<a name=145:9></a> The election then, has obtained the blessing, and the rest was blinded.<a name=145:10></a> Even as it was written, "God hath given them the spirit of slumber", etc.<a name=145:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Had they then stumbled that they should fall?<a name=145:12></a> No!<a name=145:13></a> But through their fall salvation is come to the Gentiles to provoke Israel to jealousy -- a second proof that it was not for their rejection.<a name=145:14></a> But if their diminishing and fall was a blessing to the Gentiles, what should not the fruit be of their restoration?<a name=145:15></a> If the first-fruits are holy, so is the lump; if the root, the tree also.<a name=145:16></a> Now, as to the continued chain of those who enjoy the promises in this world, Abraham was the root, and not the Gentiles; Israel, the natural stock and branches.<a name=145:17></a> And here is that which happened in the good olive-tree of promise in this world, of which Abraham was the root (God Himself the source of leaf and fruit), and Israel the stem and the tree.<a name=145:18></a> There had been some bad branches, and they had been cut off; and others from the Gentiles grafted in, in their place, who thus enjoyed the richness natural to the tree of promise.<a name=145:19></a> But it was on the principle of faith that they, being of the wild olive-tree, had been grafted in.<a name=145:20></a> Many of the Israelite branches, the natural heirs of the promises, had been cut off because of their unbelief; for when the fulfilment of the promises was offered them, they rejected it.<a name=145:21></a> They rested on their own righteousness, and despised the goodness of God.<a name=145:22></a> Thus the Gentiles, made partakers of the promises, stood on the principle of faith.<a name=145:23></a> But if they abandoned this principle, they should lose their place in the tree of promise, even as the unbelieving Jews had lost theirs.<a name=145:24></a> Goodness was to be their portion in this dispensation of God's government, with regard to those who had part in the enjoyment of His promises, if they continued in this goodness;

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is the third proof that Israel was not rejected.<a name=146:7></a> For while enemies, as concerning the gospel at the present time, they are still beloved for the fathers' sakes.<a name=146:8></a> For that which God has once chosen and called He never casts off.<a name=146:9></a> He does not repent of His counsels, nor of the call which gives them effect.<a name=146:10></a> But if the counsel of God remains unchangeable, the way in which it is accomplished brings out the marvellous wisdom of God.<a name=146:11></a> The Gentiles had long continued in the disobedience of unbelief.<a name=146:12></a> God comes in in grace.<a name=146:13></a> The Jews opposed themselves to the actings of grace.<a name=146:14></a> They lose all right to the promises through this unbelief, so that they must receive the effect of the promise on the footing of pure mercy and the sovereign grace of God,(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#46:146">footnote</a></i>) in the same way as the poor Gentile.<a name=146:15></a> For He had shut them all up in unbelief, that it might be pure mercy to all.<a name=146:16></a> Therefore it is that the apostle exclaims, O depth of wisdom and knowledge!<a name=146:17></a> The promises are fulfilled, and the pretension to human righteousness annihilated; the Jews who have lost everything receive all on the true ground of the goodness of God.<a name=146:18></a> Their apparent loss of all is but the means of their receiving all from sovereign grace, instead of having it by virtue of human righteousness, or an unforfeited promise.<a name=146:19></a>

		All is grace: yet God is ever faithful, and that in spite of man's unfaithfulness.<a name=147:1></a> Man is blessed; the Jew receives the effect of the promise; but both the one and the other have to attribute it to the pure mercy of God.<a name=147:2></a> There is nothing about the assembly here: it is the tree of promise, and those who in virtue of their position have part successively in the enjoyment of the promises of earth.<a name=147:3></a> The unbelieving Jews were never cut off from the church, they were never in it.<a name=147:4></a> They had been in the position of natural heirs of the right to the promises.<a name=147:5></a> The assembly is not the Jews' own olive-tree according to nature, so that they should be grafted into it again.<a name=147:6></a> Nothing can be plainer: the chain of those who had a right to the promises from Abraham was Israel; some of the branches were then cut off.<a name=147:7></a> The tree of promise remains on the earth: the Gentiles are grafted into it in place of the Jews, they also become unfaithful (that is to say, the case is supposed), and they would in their turn be cut off, and the Jews be reinstated in the old olive-tree, according to the promises and in order to enjoy them; but it is in pure mercy.<a name=147:8></a> It is clearly not by the gospel they get the blessing; for, as touching the gospel, they are enemies for the Gentiles' sake; as touching election, beloved for the fathers' sake.<a name=147:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Remark further here an important principle: the enjoyment of privileges by position makes us responsible for them, without saying the individual was born again.<a name=147:10></a> The Jewish branch was in the tree of promise and broken off: so the Gentiles.<a name=147:11></a> There was nothing vital or real; but they were in the place of blessing, "partakers of the root and fatness of the olive tree", by being grafted in.<a name=147:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These communications of the mind of God end this portion of the book, namely, that in which the apostle reconciles sovereign grace shewn to sinners (putting all on a level in the common ruin of sin) with the especial privileges of the people of Israel, founded on the faithfulness of God.<a name=147:13></a> They had lost everything as to right.<a name=147:14></a> God would fulfil His promises in grace and by mercy.<a name=147:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle resumes the thread of his instructions, by taking up -- as he does in all his epistles -- the moral consequences of his doctrine.<a name=147:16></a> He places the believer at the outset on the ground of God's mercy, which he had fully developed already.<a name=147:17></a> The principle of grace that saves had been established as the basis of salvation.<a name=147:18></a> The ground of all christian morality is now laid

		in this fundamental principle: -- to present our bodies as a sacrifice, living, holy, acceptable to God -- an intelligent service, not that of the hands, not consisting in ceremonies which the body could perform -- a simple but deep-reaching and all-efficacious principle.<a name=148:1></a> This was for man personally.<a name=148:2></a> As to his outward relationships, he was not to be conformed to the world.<a name=148:3></a> Neither was this to be an outside mechanical nonconformity, but the result of being renewed in mind, so as to seek for and discern the will of God, good and acceptable and perfect; the life being thus transformed.<a name=148:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This connects itself with the end of chapter 6.<a name=148:5></a> It is not those sitting in heavenly places, imitators of God as dear children, but men on earth set free by the delivering power of redemption and grace, yielding themselves up to God to do His will.<a name=148:6></a> The exhortation follows the character we have seen to be that of the epistle.<a name=148:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus the christian walk was characterised by devotedness and obedience.<a name=148:8></a> It was a life subjected to the will of another, namely, to the will of God; and therefore stamped with humility and dependence.<a name=148:9></a> But there was absolute devotedness of heart in self-sacrifice.<a name=148:10></a> For there was a danger, flowing from the power that acted in it, of the flesh coming in and availing itself of it.<a name=148:11></a> With regard to this, every one was to have a spirit of wisdom and moderation, and to act within the limits of the gift which God had dispensed to him, occupying himself with it according to the will of God; even as each member has its own place in the body, and should accomplish the function which God has ascribed to it.<a name=148:12></a> The apostle passes on insensibly to all the forms which duty assumes in the Christian, according to the various positions in which he stands, and to the spirit in which he ought to walk in every relationship.<a name=148:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is in chapter 12 only that the idea of the assembly as a body is thus found in this epistle; and that, in connection with the duties of the members individually -- duties that flowed from their positions as such.<a name=148:14></a> Otherwise it is the position of man in his individual responsibility before God, and this met by grace, and then the delivered man, that is set before us in the Epistle to the Romans.<a name=148:15></a> The directions given by the apostle extend to the Christian's relationship with the authorities under which he is placed.<a name=148:16></a> He recognises them as accomplishing the service of God, and as armed with authority from Him, so that resisting them would be resisting that which God had

	<div class="paragraph">
		Among themselves Christians are exhorted not to seek the high things of this world, but to walk as brethren with those of low degree: a precept too much forgotten in the assembly of God -- to her loss.<a name=149:4></a> If the Christian of high degree requires that honour according to the flesh should be paid him, let it be done with good will.<a name=149:5></a> Happy he who, according to the example of the King of kings and to the precept of our apostle, knows how to walk in company with those of low degree in their journey through the wilderness.<a name=149:6></a> Now love is the fulfilling of the law; for love works no ill to his neighbour, and so fulfils the law.<a name=149:7></a>

		Another principle acts also on the spirit of the Christian.<a name=149:8></a> It is time to awake.<a name=149:9></a> The deliverance from this present evil age, which the Lord will accomplish for us, draws nigh.<a name=149:10></a> The night is far spent, the day is at hand -- God knows the moment.<a name=149:11></a> The characteristics which marked its approach in the days of the apostle have ripened in a very different way since then, although God, with a view to those whom He is gathering in, is still even now restraining them.<a name=149:12></a> Let us then walk as children of the day, casting off the works of darkness.<a name=149:13></a> We belong to the day, of which Christ Himself will be the light.<a name=149:14></a> Let our walk be in accordance with that day, putting on Christ Himself, and not being studious of that which is in accordance with the will and the lusts of the flesh.<a name=149:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		From the beginning of chapter 14 to the end of verse 7 in chapter 15 another point is taken up, to which the different positions of the Jew and Gentile gave rise.<a name=149:16></a> It was difficult for a Jew to rid himself of the sense of difference between days and between meats.<a name=149:17></a> A Gentile, having abandoned his whole religious system as idolatrous, held to nothing.<a name=149:18></a> Human nature is liable in this respect to sin on both sides -- a want of conscience, an unbridled will, and a ceremonial conscience.<a name=149:19></a> Christianity recognises neither of these things.<a name=149:20></a> It delivers from the question of days and meats by making us heavenly with Christ.<a name=149:21></a> But it teaches us to bear with conscientious weakness, and to be conscientious ourselves.<a name=149:22></a> Conscience cannot -- has not a right to -- prescribe a new thing to us as a duty, but it may,

		Never having known the Roman Christians as an assembly, Paul sends many personal salutations.<a name=152:4></a> This was the link which subsisted.<a name=152:5></a> We see how touchingly his heart dwells upon all the details of service which attached him to those who had rendered it.<a name=152:6></a> He who by grace had searched into all the counsels of God, who had been admitted to see that which could not be made known to man here below, remembered all that these humble Christians -- these devoted women -- had done for him and for the Lord.<a name=152:7></a> This is love; it is the real proof of the power of the Spirit of God; it is the bond of charity.<a name=152:8></a>

		We have yet to observe, with regard to the three verses at the end of the epistle, that they are, as it were, detached from all the rest, introducing, in the form of a doxology, the suggestion of a truth, the communication of which distinguished the apostle's teaching.<a name=153:3></a> He does not develop it here.<a name=153:4></a> The task which the Holy Ghost accomplished in this epistle, was the presentation of the soul individually before God according to the divine thoughts.<a name=153:5></a> Nevertheless this connects itself immediately with the position of the body; and the doctrine respecting the body, the assembly, cannot be separated from it.<a name=153:6></a> Now the apostle informs us distinctly, that the mystery, the assembly, and the gathering together in one of all things under Christ, had been entirely unknown: God had been silent on that subject in the times which were defined by the word ages, the assembly not forming a part of that course of events, and of the ways of God on earth.<a name=153:7></a> But the mystery was now revealed and communicated to the Gentiles by prophetic writings -- not "the writings of the prophets".<a name=153:8></a> The epistles addressed to the Gentiles possessed this character; they were prophetic writings -- a fresh proof of the character of the epistles in the New Testament.<a name=153:9></a>

		The Epistle to the Corinthians presents very different subjects from those which occupied us in the one addressed to the Romans.<a name=154:1></a> We find in it moral details, and the interior order of an assembly, with regard to which the Spirit of God here displays His wisdom in a direct way.<a name=154:2></a> There is no mention of elders or of other functionaries of the assembly.<a name=154:3></a> Through the labours of the apostle a numerous assembly had been formed (for God had much people in that city) in the midst of a very corrupt population, where riches and luxury were united with a moral disorder which had made the city a proverb.<a name=154:4></a> At the same time, here as elsewhere, false teachers (in general, Jews) sought to undermine the influence of the apostle.<a name=154:5></a> The spirit of philosophy did not fail also to exercise its baneful influence, although Corinth was not, like Athens, its principal seat.<a name=154:6></a> Morality and the authority of the apostle were compromised together; and the state of things was most critical.<a name=154:7></a> The Epistle was written from Ephesus, where the tidings of the sad state of the flock at Corinth had reached the apostle, almost at the moment when he had determined to visit them on his way into Macedonia (instead of passing along the coast of Asia Minor as he did), then returning to pay them a second visit on his way back.<a name=154:8></a> These tidings prevented his doing so, and, instead of visiting them to pour out his heart among them, he wrote this letter.<a name=154:9></a> The second epistle was written in Macedonia, when Titus had brought him word of the happy effect of the first.<a name=154:10></a>

		The subjects of this first epistle are very easily divided into their natural order.<a name=154:11></a> In the first place, before he blames the Christians at Corinth to whom he writes, the apostle acknowledges all the grace which God had already bestowed on them, and would still impart.<a name=154:12></a> Chapter 1: 1 - 9.<a name=154:13></a> From verse 10 to chapter 4: 21 the subject of divisions, schools of doctrine and human wisdom, is spoken of in contrast with revelation and divine wisdom.<a name=154:14></a> Chapter 5, the corruption of morals, and discipline, whether by power, or in the responsibility of the assembly.<a name=154:15></a> Chapter 6, temporal affairs, law-suits; and again the subject of fornication, which was of primary importance for the Christians of this city.<a name=154:16></a> Chapter 7, marriage is considered.<a name=154:17></a>

		The reader may remark a difference in the address in the Corinthians and Ephesians.<a name=155:11></a> In the Corinthians, "To the church of God", etc.<a name=155:12></a>, "with all that in every place call on the name of the Lord Jesus".<a name=155:13></a> It is the professing church, the members being assumed to be faithful, at any rate in character such till put out, and with that, every one that owned Jesus as Lord, -- the house; hence chapter 10: 1 - 5.<a name=155:14></a> In Ephesians it is "Holy and faithful brethren", and we have the proper privileges of the body.<a name=155:15></a> This character of the epistle, as embracing the professing church, and recognising a local assembly as representing it in the locality, gives the epistle great importance.<a name=155:16></a> Further, I think it will be found that the outward professing assembly is dealt with to the middle of chapter 10 (and there the nature of the Lord's supper introduces the one body of Christ, which is treated of as to the gifts of the Spirit in chapter 12); comeliness in woman's activities in the first verses of chapter 11; and afterwards from verse 17 what befits the coming together in the assembly, and the Lord's

		I will now turn back to take up the thread of the contents of this epistle from the beginning.<a name=156:5></a> Paul was an apostle by the will of God.<a name=156:6></a> That was his authority, however it might be with others.<a name=156:7></a> Moreover the same call that made those of Corinth Christians had made him an apostle.<a name=156:8></a> He addresses the assembly of God at Corinth, adding a character (the application of which is evident when we consider the contents of the epistle) -- "sanctified in Christ Jesus".<a name=156:9></a> Afterwards the universality of the application of the doctrine and instructions of the epistle, and of its authority over all Christians, wherever they might be, is brought forward in this address.<a name=156:10></a> Happily, whatever sorrow he felt at the state of the Corinthians, the apostle could fall back upon the grace of God, and thus recognise all the grace which He had bestowed on them.<a name=156:11></a> But the placing them thus in relationship to God brought all the effects of His holiness to bear upon their consciences, while giving the apostle's heart the encouragement of the perfect grace of God towards them.<a name=156:12></a> And this grace itself became a powerful lever for the word in the hearts of the Corinthians.<a name=156:13></a> In the presence of such grace they ought to be ashamed of sin.<a name=156:14></a> Nor can there be a more remarkable testimony than is here found of reckoning on the faithfulness of God towards His people.<a name=156:15></a> The relationship does claim holiness: in holiness alone it is enjoyed; but it reposes on the faithfulness of God.<a name=156:16></a> The Corinthians were walking, as we know, badly.<a name=156:17></a> The apostle lets none of the evil pass; but still he declares that God was faithful and would confirm them to the end that they might be -- not safe, but -- blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ, and then proceeds to blame them.<a name=156:18></a> what a wonderful testimony!<a name=156:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul (the Spirit Himself) thus linked the Corinthians with God; and that which He was in this connection with them had all its force upon their hearts and consciences.<a name=156:20></a> At the same time the use of this weapon opened their heart to all that the apostle had to say.<a name=156:21></a> One must be very near the Lord to be able in practice thus to look at Christians who are walking badly.<a name=156:22></a> It is not to spare their sins -- the apostle is very far from doing

		Nevertheless, when once the soul was taught and established in the doctrine of salvation in Christ, there was a wisdom of which the apostle spoke; not the wisdom of this present age, nor of the princes of this age, which perish, wisdom and all; but the wisdom of God in a mystery, a secret counsel of God (revealed now by the Spirit), ordained in His settled purpose unto our glory before the world was -- a counsel which, with all

		The apostle does not touch the subject of the mystery, because he had to feed them as babes, and only in order to put it in contrast with the false wisdom of the world; but the way in which this wisdom was communicated is important.<a name=159:3></a> That which had never entered into the heart of man(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#46:159">footnote</a></i>) God had revealed by His Spirit, for the Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.<a name=159:4></a> It is only the spirit of a man which is in him that knows the things which he has not communicated.<a name=159:5></a> So no one knows the things of God save the Spirit of God.<a name=159:6></a> Now it is the Spirit of God which the apostle and the other vessels of revelation had received, that they might know the things which are freely given of God.<a name=159:7></a> This is the knowledge of the things themselves in the vessels of revelation.<a name=159:8></a> Afterwards this instrument of God was to communicate them.<a name=159:9></a> He did so, not in words which the art of man taught, but which the Spirit -- which God -- taught, communicating spiritual things by a spiritual medium.<a name=159:10></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#46:159">footnote</a></i>) The communication was by the Spirit as well as the thing communicated.<a name=159:11></a> There was yet one thing wanting that this revelation might be possessed by others -- the reception of these communications.<a name=159:12></a> This also required the action of the Spirit.<a name=159:13></a> The natural man did not receive them; and they are spiritually discerned.<a name=159:14></a>

		Christians to marry, was not a commandment from the Lord, given by inspiration, but the fruit of the apostle's experience -- an experience to which the presence of the Holy Ghost was not wanting.<a name=167:1></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#46:167">footnote</a></i>) He would rather that every one were like himself; but every one had, in this respect, his gift from God.<a name=167:2></a> To the unmarried and the widows, it is good, he says, to abide as he himself was; but if they could not subdue their nature and remain in calm purity, it was better to marry.<a name=167:3></a> Unsubduedness of desire was more hurtful than the bond of marriage.<a name=167:4></a> But as to marriage itself, there was no longer room for the counsel of experience, the commandment of the Lord was positive.<a name=167:5></a> The woman was not to separate from the man, nor the man from the woman; and if they separated, the bond was not broken; they must remain unmarried or else be reconciled.<a name=167:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there was a case more complicated, when the man was converted and the wife unconverted, or vice versa.<a name=167:7></a> According to the law a man who had married a woman of the Gentiles (and was consequently profane and unclean) defiled himself, and was compelled to send her away; and their children had no right to Jewish privileges; they were rejected as unclean (see <a href="../bible/Ezra.htm#10:3">Ezra  10:3</a>).<a name=167:8></a> But under grace it was quite the contrary.<a name=167:9></a> The converted husband sanctified the wife, and vice versa, and their children were reckoned clean before God; they had part in the ecclesiastical rights of their parent.<a name=167:10></a> This is the sense of the word "holy", in connection with the question of order and of outward relationship towards God, which was suggested by the obligation under the law to send away wife and children in a similar case.<a name=167:11></a> Thus the believer was not to send away his wife, nor to forsake an unbelieving husband.<a name=167:12></a> If the unbeliever forsook the believer definitively, the latter (man or woman) was free -- "let him depart".<a name=167:13></a> The brother was no longer bound to consider the one who had forsaken him as his wife, nor the sister the man who had forsook her as her husband.<a name=167:14></a> But they were called to peace, and not to seek this separation, for how did the believer know if he should not be the means of

	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle had spoken of marriage, of the unmarried and of widows; he had been questioned also with respect to those who had never entered into any relationship with woman.<a name=168:7></a> On this point he had no commandment from the Lord.<a name=168:8></a> He could only give his judgment as one who had received mercy of the Lord to be faithful.<a name=168:9></a> It was good to remain in that condition, seeing what the world was and the difficulties of a christian life.<a name=168:10></a> If they were bound to a wife, let them not seek to be loosed.<a name=168:11></a> If free, they would do well to remain so.<a name=168:12></a> Thus if they married, they did well; not marrying, they did better.<a name=168:13></a> He who had not known a woman did not sin if he married, but he should have trouble after the flesh in his life here below.<a name=168:14></a> (It will be observed, that it is not the daughter of a Christian that is here spoken of, but his own personal condition.<a name=168:15></a>) If he stood firm, and had power over his own will, it was the better way; if he married, he still did well; if he did not marry, it was better.<a name=168:16></a> It was the same with a woman; and if the apostle said that according to his judgment it was better, he had the Spirit of God.<a name=168:17></a> His experience -- if he had no commandment -- had not been gained without the Spirit, but it was that of a man who could say (if any one had a right to say it) that he had the Spirit of God.<a name=168:18></a>

		Moreover the time was short: the married were to be as having no wives; buyers, as having no possession; they who used the world, not using it as though it were theirs.<a name=168:19></a> Only the apostle would have them without carefulness or distraction, that they might serve the Lord.<a name=168:20></a> If by reckoning themselves dead to nature this effect was not produced, they gained nothing, they lost by it.<a name=168:21></a> When married they were pre-occupied with things below, in order to please their wives and to provide for their children.<a name=168:22></a> But they enjoyed a repose of mind, in which nature did not claim her rights with a will that they had failed to silence, and holiness of walk and of heart was maintained.<a name=168:23></a>

		Two things strike us here in passing: the holiness which all these directions breathe with regard to that which touches so closely the desires of the flesh.<a name=169:3></a> The institutions of God, formed for man when innocent, are maintained in all their integrity, in all their authority, a safeguard now against the sin to which man is incited by his flesh.<a name=169:4></a> The Spirit introduces a new energy above nature, which in no wise weakens the authority of the institution.<a name=169:5></a> If any one can live above nature in order to serve the Lord in freedom, it is a gift of God -- a grace which he does well to profit by.<a name=169:6></a> A second very important principle flows from this chapter.<a name=169:7></a> The apostle distinguishes accurately between that which he has by inspiration, and his own spiritual experience -- that which the Spirit gave him in connection with the exercises of his individual life -- spiritual wisdom, however exalted it might be.<a name=169:8></a> On certain points he had no commandment from the Lord.<a name=169:9></a> He gave the conclusion at which he had arrived, through the help of the Spirit of God, in a life of remarkable faithfulness, and aided by the Spirit whom he but little grieved.<a name=169:10></a> But it was not a commandment of the Lord.<a name=169:11></a> On other points that which he did not except in this manner was to be received as the commandment of the Lord (compare chapter 14: 37).<a name=169:12></a> That is to say, he affirms the inspiration, properly so called, of his writings -- they were to be received as emanating from the Lord Himself -- distinguishing this inspiration from his own spiritual competency, a principle of all importance.<a name=169:13></a>

		Such was the presence of the Holy Ghost.<a name=184:12></a> In our chapter, the apostle speaks of the manifestations of His presence in the gifts which were exercised by the instrumentality of members of the body, whether for the calling out and edification of the assembly, or in testimony to those outside.<a name=184:13></a> Before entering on this subject, he gives the Corinthians -- whom the enemy would have deeply deceived -- that which would enable them to distinguish between the manifestation of the Holy Ghost and the actings of an evil spirit.<a name=184:14></a> He then speaks of gifts.<a name=184:15></a>

		voluntary power: whatever might be the energy of the Spirit in them, they did not cease to be servants and stewards of Christ, and they were to act in this character, acknowledging in their service the Lordship of Christ.<a name=185:1></a> Nevertheless, although it was power in a man, and that it was man who acted, so that he was a servant (and a Man who was Head and who was served, although He was Son of God and Lord of all), yet it was God who wrought, one and the same God who wrought all in all.<a name=185:2></a> It is not the Trinity, properly speaking, that is presented here in its own character, but one only Spirit acting in Christians, Jesus Lord, and God acting in the gifts.<a name=185:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The gifts are manifestations of the energy of the Spirit thus committed to men, under Christ who is Head and Lord; men were to use them as serving the Lord.<a name=185:4></a> Now Christ thought of what was profitable to His people, to those that were His; and the manifestation of the Spirit was given for the profit of souls, of the assembly in general.<a name=185:5></a> The apostle notices several of these gifts; but he reminds us again that it is the same Spirit who works in each case, distributing to every one according to His own will.<a name=185:6></a> Let the reader remark this passage.<a name=185:7></a> The apostle had said that God wrought all these things, and had spoken of the gifts as being manifestations of the Spirit.<a name=185:8></a> It might have been supposed that the Spirit was some vague influence, and that one must attribute everything to God without recognising a personal Spirit.<a name=185:9></a> But these operations, which were attributed to God in verse 6, are here attributed to the Spirit; and it is added, that He, the Spirit, distributes to each as He will.<a name=185:10></a> It is not therefore an inferior Spirit.<a name=185:11></a> Where He works, it is God who works; but these operations in men are gifts distributed according to the will of the Spirit, the Spirit being thus presented as acting personally in this distribution and according to His will.<a name=185:12></a>

		Some of the gifts may require a short observation.<a name=185:13></a> Wisdom is the application of divine light to right and wrong, and to all the circumstances through which we pass -- an expression which has a wide extent, because it applies to everything with regard to which we have to form a judgment.<a name=185:14></a> The Holy Ghost furnishes some in a peculiar way with this wisdom, with a wisdom according to God -- a perception of the true nature of things, and of their relationship to each other, and of conduct with regard to both, which, coming from God, guides us through the difficulties of the way, and enables us to avoid that which would place us in a false position towards God and man.<a name=185:15></a>

		Knowledge is intelligence in the mind of God as it is revealed to us.<a name=186:1></a> Faith is not here simple faith in the gospel; that is not a distinctive gift which one believer may possess and another not.<a name=186:2></a> This is evident.<a name=186:3></a> It is the faith, the energy, given by God, which overcomes difficulties, which rises above dangers, which confronts them without being alarmed by them.<a name=186:4></a> The discerning of spirits is not that of a man's condition of soul -- it has nothing to do with it.<a name=186:5></a> It is the knowing how to discern, by the mighty energy of the Spirit of God, the actings of evil spirits, and to bring them to light if necessary, in contrast with the action of the Spirit of God.<a name=186:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The other gifts require no comment.<a name=186:7></a> We must now return to the unity of the Spirit, with which is connected that which the apostle says after having spoken of the gifts.<a name=186:8></a> The Spirit was one, he had said, working diversely in the members according to His will.<a name=186:9></a> The importance of His personality, and the immense import of His divinity (if we reflect that it is He who works in and by man) is very evident when we observe that He is the centre and the living power of the unity of the whole body, so that the individuals, in the exercise of their gifts, are but the members of the one and the same body divinely formed by the power and the presence of the Spirit.<a name=186:10></a> This point the apostle develops largely, in connection with the oneness of the body, the mutual dependence of the members, and the relationship of each one to the body as a whole.<a name=186:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The practical instructions are easily understood, but there are some important points in the general principles.<a name=186:12></a> The oneness of the body is produced by the baptism of the Holy Ghost, and the connection of the members depends upon it.<a name=186:13></a> By one Spirit we have all been baptised to be one body.<a name=186:14></a> The Lord's supper is the expression of this oneness; the Spirit is He who produces it, and who is its strength.<a name=186:15></a> The distinctive character of Jew and Gentile -- and all other distinctions -- was lost in the power of one Spirit common to all, who united them all as redeemed ones in one only body.<a name=186:16></a> The apostle in this verse (13) speaks of the baptism of the Holy Ghost; but the word suggests to him the supper, the second ordinance of the Lord, and he speaks of drinking into one spirit, alluding, I doubt not, to the Lord's supper.<a name=186:17></a> He does not speak of the Holy Ghost: one spirit was the state of the believers, the word being used in contrast with one body, associated in one heart and mind by the Spirit -- participating in Christ.<a name=186:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=187>[Page 187]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not faith which is union, nor even life, though both are the portion of those united, but the Holy Ghost.<a name=187:1></a> The baptism of the Holy Ghost, then, is that which forms Christians into one only body, and they are all made partakers of, are animated individually by, one and the same Spirit.<a name=187:2></a> Thus there are many members, but one only body, and a body composed of these members, which are dependent the one on the other, and have need of each other.<a name=187:3></a> And even those gifts which were the most shining were comparatively of the least value, even as a man clothes and ornaments the least honourable parts of his body, and leaves the more beautiful parts uncovered.<a name=187:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another point which the apostle marks, is the common interest that exists among them in that they are members of the one and the same body.<a name=187:5></a> If one suffers, all suffer, since there is but one body animated by one Spirit.<a name=187:6></a> If one is honoured, all rejoice.<a name=187:7></a> This also depends on the one self-same Spirit who unites and animates them.<a name=187:8></a> Moreover this body is the body of Christ.<a name=187:9></a> "Ye are", says the apostle, "the body of Christ, and members in particular".<a name=187:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Observe, also, here that, although that assembly at Corinth was only a part of the body of Christ, the apostle speaks of the whole body; for the assembly there was, according to the principle of its gathering, the body of Christ as assembled at Corinth.<a name=187:11></a> It is true that at the beginning he speaks of all those who call on the name of the Lord Jesus; but in fact he addresses the Corinthian assembly.<a name=187:12></a> And the general expression shews that, in the walk of the assembly, and in its general interests, a local assembly cannot be separated from the whole body of Christians on earth; and the language employed here shews that, as to their position before God, the Christians of one town were considered as representing the whole assembly, as far as regarded that locality; not as independent of the rest, but, on the contrary, as inseparably united to the others, living and acting, with respect to that locality as members of the body of Christ, and looked upon as such in it, because every Christian formed a part of that body, and they formed a part of it likewise.<a name=187:13></a> From the verses that follow we see that the apostle, while looking upon the Christians there as the body of Christ, the members of which they were, has in his mind the whole assembly as the assembly of God.<a name=187:14></a> In the New Testament there is no other membership than that of Christ, except that they are members of each other, as forming the entire body, but

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Moreover the body of Christ, the assembly, is looked at here as a whole upon the earth.<a name=188:4></a> God has set in the assembly, apostles, prophets, etc.<a name=188:5></a>; miracles, healings, tongues.<a name=188:6></a> It is very plain that this is on the earth, as were the Corinthians, and that it is the assembly as a whole.<a name=188:7></a> Healings and tongues were not in heaven, and the apostles were not those of an individual assembly.<a name=188:8></a> In a word it was the Holy Ghost, come down from heaven, who had formed the unity of the body on earth, and who acted in it by the especial gifts which distinguished the members.<a name=188:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle then points out these gifts, not to give a formal and complete list of them, but to mark the order and importance of those he mentions.<a name=188:10></a> Tongues, of which the Corinthians were so proud, are the last gifts named in the list.<a name=188:11></a> Some gifts then, were more excellent than others; they were to be estimated according to the measure in which they served for the edification of the assembly.<a name=188:12></a> Those which served this end were to be desired.<a name=188:13></a>

		In that which is said of love in this chapter we find the reproduction of the divine nature, except that what is said is but the negative of the selfishness of the flesh in us.<a name=190:3></a> Now the divine nature changes not and never ceases; love therefore abides ever.<a name=190:4></a> Communications from God; the means by which they are made; knowledge, as attained here below, according to which we apprehend the truth in part only, although the whole truth is revealed to us (for we apprehend it in detail, so that we have never the whole at once, the character of our knowledge being to lay hold of different truths singly); all that is characterised by being in part -- passes away.<a name=190:5></a> Love will not pass away.<a name=190:6></a> A child learns; he rejoices too in things that amuse him; when he becomes a man, he requires things in accordance with his intelligence as a man.<a name=190:7></a> It was thus with tongues and the edification of the assembly.<a name=190:8></a> The time however was coming when they should know even as they were known, not by communications of truths to a capacity that apprehended the truth in its different parts, but they should understand it as a whole in its unity.<a name=190:9></a>

		Believers therefore were to follow after and seek for love, while desiring gifts, especially that they might prophesy, because thus they would edify the assembly, and that was the thing to aim at; it was that which love desired and sought, it was that which intelligence required, the two marks of a man in Christ, of one to whom Christ is all.<a name=190:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Of such communication the apostle distinguishes two kinds -- revelation and knowledge.<a name=191:6></a> The latter supposes a revelation already given, of which some one availed himself by the Holy Ghost for the good of the flock.<a name=191:7></a> He then points out the gifts which were respectively the means of edifying in these two ways.<a name=191:8></a> It is not that the two latter terms (verse 6) are the equivalents of the two former; but the two things here spoken of as edifying the church were accomplished by means of these two gifts.<a name=191:9></a> There might be "prophecy" without its being absolutely a new revelation, although there was more in it than knowledge.<a name=191:10></a> It might contain an application of the thoughts of God, an address on the part of God to the soul, to the conscience, which would be more than knowledge, but which would not be a new revelation.<a name=191:11></a> God acts therein without revealing a new truth, or a new fact.<a name=191:12></a> "Knowledge", or "doctrine", teaches truths, or explains the word, a thing very useful to the assembly; but in it there is not the direct action of the Spirit in application, and thus not the direct manifestation of the presence of God to men in their own conscience and heart.<a name=191:13></a> When any one teaches, he who is spiritual profits by it; when one prophesies, even he who is not spiritual may feel it, he is reached and judged; and it is the same thing with the Christian's conscience.<a name=191:14></a> Revelation, or knowledge, is a perfect division and embraces everything.<a name=191:15></a> Prophecy, and doctrine, are in intimate connection with the two; but prophecy embraces other ideas, so that this division does not exactly answer to the first two terms.<a name=191:16></a>

		What a marvellous power, what a manifestation of the presence of God -- a thing worthy of the deepest attention -- and, at the same time, what superiority to all carnal vanity, to the lustre reflected upon the individual by means of gifts -- what moral power of the Spirit of God, where love saw nothing in these manifestations of power in gift but instruments to be used for the good of the assembly and of souls!<a name=192:9></a> It was the practical force of that love, to the exercise of which, as being superior to gifts, he exhorted the faithful.<a name=192:10></a> It was the love and the wisdom of God directing the exercise of His power for the good of those whom He loved.<a name=192:11></a> What a position for a man!<a name=192:12></a> What simplicity is imparted by the grace of God to one who forgets self in humility and love, and what power in that humility!<a name=192:13></a> The apostle confirms his argument by the effect that would be produced on strangers who might come into the assembly, or on unenlightened Christians, if they heard languages spoken which no one understood: they would think them mad.<a name=192:14></a> Prophecy, reaching their conscience, would make them feel that God was there -- was present in the assembly of God.<a name=192:15></a>

		The apostle desires that the faithful should come to the truth and to order, conducted by their own affections; not fearing, if necessary for their good, to avail himself of an authority without appeal, as speaking directly from God -- an authority which God would justify if the apostle was forced unwillingly to use it.<a name=194:1></a> If any were ignorant that he wrote by the Spirit with the authority of God, it was ignorance indeed; let such be given up to their ignorance.<a name=194:2></a> Spiritual and simple men would be delivered from such pretensions.<a name=194:3></a> Those who were really filled with the Spirit would acknowledge that what the apostle wrote came immediately from God, and was the expression of His wisdom, of that which became Him: for often there may be the recognition of divine or even human wisdom when it is found, where there was not the ability to find it, nor, if it were perceived in part, the power to set it forth with authority.<a name=194:4></a> Meanwhile the man of pretension, reduced to this place, would find the place profitable, and that which he needed.<a name=194:5></a>

		But other evils had found means to introduce themselves into the midst of the shining gifts which were exercised in the bosom of the flock at Corinth.<a name=194:10></a> The resurrection of the dead was denied.<a name=194:11></a> Satan is wily in his dealings.<a name=194:12></a> Apparently it was only the body that was in question; nevertheless the whole gospel was at stake, for if the dead rose not, then Christ was not risen.<a name=194:13></a> And if Christ was not risen, the sins of the faithful were not put away, and the gospel was not true.<a name=194:14></a> The apostle therefore reserved this question for the end of his epistle, and he enters into it thoroughly.<a name=194:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Observe, in passing, that the apostle can speak of nothing without a moral effect being produced in his heart, because he thinks of it with God.<a name=195:6></a> Thus, verses 8 - 10, he calls to mind the state of things with regard to himself and to the other apostles, and that which grace had done; and then, his heart unburdened, he returns to his subject.<a name=195:7></a> The testimony of every divine witness was the same.<a name=195:8></a> Everything declared that Christ was risen; everything depended on the fact that He was so.<a name=195:9></a> This was his starting-point.<a name=195:10></a> If, said he, that which was preached among you is that Christ was raised from the dead, how happens it that some among you say there is no resurrection of the dead?<a name=195:11></a> If there is none, Christ is not risen; if He is not risen, the preaching of His witnesses is vain, the faith of Christians vain.<a name=195:12></a> Nor that only; but these witnesses are false witnesses, for they had declared, with respect to God, that He had raised up Christ from the dead.<a name=195:13></a> But God had not raised Him up if the dead do not rise.<a name=195:14></a> And in that case their faith was vain: they were yet in their sins; and those who had already fallen asleep in Christ had perished.<a name=195:15></a> Now, if it be in this life only that the believer has hope in Christ, he is of all men the most miserable; he does but suffer as to this world.<a name=195:16></a> But it is not so, for Christ is risen.<a name=195:17></a>

		Here, however, it is not only a general doctrine that the dead are raised.<a name=195:18></a> Christ, in rising, came up from among the dead.<a name=195:19></a> It is the favour and the power of God come in,(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#46:195">footnote</a></i>) to bring back

		This evidently gives a very peculiar character to the resurrection.<a name=196:3></a> It is not only that the dead rise, but that God, by His power, brings back certain persons from among the dead, on account of the favour which He has for them, and in connection with the life and the Spirit which are in them.<a name=196:4></a> Christ has a quite peculiar place.<a name=196:5></a> Life was in Him, and He is our life.<a name=196:6></a> He gained this victory by which we profit.<a name=196:7></a> He is of right the first-fruits.<a name=196:8></a> It was due to His glory.<a name=196:9></a> Had He not gained the victory, we should always have remained in prison.<a name=196:10></a> He had power Himself to resume life, but the great principle is the same, it is not only a resurrection of the dead, but those who are alive according to God arise as the objects of His favour, and by the exercise of that power which wills to have them for Himself and with Himself -- Christ, the first-fruits: those who are Christ's, at His coming.<a name=196:11></a> We are associated with Christ in resurrection.<a name=196:12></a> We come out like Him, not only from death, but from the dead.<a name=196:13></a> We mark, too, here how Christ and His people are inseparably identified.<a name=196:14></a> If they do not rise, He is not risen.<a name=196:15></a> He was as really dead as we can be, has taken in grace our place under death, was a man as we are men (save sin) so truly that, if you deny this result for us, you deny the fact as to Him; and the object and foundation of faith itself fails.<a name=196:16></a> This identification of Christ with men, so as to be able to draw a conclusion from us to Him, is full of power and blessing.<a name=196:17></a> If the dead do not rise, He is not risen; He was as truly dead as we can be.<a name=196:18></a>

		Now, in the resurrection, there is an order according to the wisdom of God for the accomplishment of His counsels -- Christ, the first-fruits; those who are Christ's, at His coming again.<a name=197:21></a> Thus those who are in Christ are quickened according to the power of the life which is in Christ; it is the resurrection of life.<a name=197:22></a> But this is not the whole extent of resurrection as acquired by Christ, in gaining the victory over death according to the Spirit of holiness.<a name=197:23></a> The Father has given Him power over all flesh, that He should give eternal life to as many as the Father had given Him.<a name=197:24></a> The latter are those of whom this chapter treats essentially, because its subject is resurrection among Christians; and the apostle, the Spirit Himself, loves to speak on the subject of the power of eternal life in Christ.<a name=197:25></a> Yet he cannot entirely omit the other part of the truth.<a name=197:26></a> The

		Thus we find in this passage resurrection by man -- death having entered by man; the relationship of the saints with Jesus, the source and the power of life, the consequence being His resurrection, and theirs at His coming; power over all things committed to Christ, the risen Man; afterwards the kingdom given back to God the Father, the tabernacle of God with men, and the man Christ, the second Adam, eternally a man subject to the Supreme -- this last a truth of infinite value to us (the resurrection of the wicked, though supposed in the resurrection brought in by Christ, not being the direct subject of the chapter).<a name=199:11></a> The reader must now remark that this passage is a revelation, in which the Spirit of God, having fixed the apostle's thoughts upon Jesus and the resurrection, suddenly

		By taking the verses 20 - 28 (which contain so important a revelation in a passage that is complete in itself) as a parenthesis, the verses 29 - 34 become much more intelligible, and some expressions, which have greatly harassed interpreters, have a tolerably determined sense.<a name=200:4></a> The apostle had said, in verse 16, "If the dead rise not", and then, that if such were the case, those who had fallen asleep in Jesus had perished, and that the living were of all men most miserable.<a name=200:5></a> At verse 28 he returns to these points, and speaks of those who are baptised for the dead, in connection with the assertion, that if there were no resurrection those who had fallen asleep in Christ had perished; "if", he says, repeating more forcibly the expression in verse 16, "the dead rise not at all"; and then shews how entirely he is himself in the second case he had spoken of, "of all men most miserable", and almost in the case of perishing also, being every moment in danger, striving as with wild beasts, dying daily.<a name=200:6></a> Baptised, then, for the dead is to become a Christian with the view fixed on those who have fallen asleep in Christ, and particularly as being slain for Him, taking one's portion with the dead, yea, with the dead Christ; it is the very meaning of baptism (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>).<a name=200:7></a> How senseless if they do not rise!<a name=200:8></a> As in <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#4">1 Thessalonians  4</a>, the subject, while speaking of all Christians, is looked at in the same way.<a name=200:9></a> The word translated "for" is frequently used in these epistles for "in view of", "with reference to".<a name=200:10></a>

		But Apollos shared the apostle's feeling; he was not inclined to recognise, or by his presence to have the appearance of upholding, that which prevented Paul going thither; and the more so because there were some in the assembly at Corinth who wished to use his name as the standard of a party.<a name=209:1></a> Free in his movements, he would act according to the judgment which the Lord would enable him to form.<a name=209:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		After speaking of Apollos, the apostle's mind turns again to his children in the faith, dear to him, whatever their faults might be.<a name=209:3></a> Verses 13, 14, are the effusion of a heart which forgot these faults in the ardent desire of a charity that only thought of their blessing according to the Spirit.<a name=209:4></a> Three Corinthians had brought him supplies; it does not appear to have been on the part of the assembly, nor that it was any testimony of its love which had refreshed the apostle's heart.<a name=209:5></a> He would have the Corinthians to rejoice at it.<a name=209:6></a> He does not doubt that they loved him enough to be refreshed because it was so.<a name=209:7></a> Their charity had not thought of it beforehand; but he expresses his conviction that they took pleasure in the thought of his heart being refreshed.<a name=209:8></a> It is touching to see here, that the apostle's charity suggests that which grace would produce on the heart of the Corinthians, communicating that which they probably would not otherwise have known of -- the active charity of three brethren of the assembly; and, in love uniting them to his joy, if they had not been united to that which occasioned it.<a name=209:9></a> The flame of charity communicates itself by rising above coldness, and reaching the depths of divine life in the heart; and, once communicated, the soul, before unkindled, glows now with the same fire.<a name=209:10></a>

		We find in this chapter four channels, so to speak, of ministry.<a name=209:11></a> Firstly, the apostle, sent direct from the Lord and by the Holy Ghost.<a name=209:12></a> Secondly, persons associated with the apostle in his work, and acting at his desire, and (in the case of Timothy) one pointed out by prophecy.<a name=209:13></a> Thirdly, an entirely independent labourer, partly instructed by others (see <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#18:26">Acts  18:26</a>), but acting where he saw fit, according to the Lord and to the gift he had received.<a name=209:14></a> Fourthly, one who gives himself to the service of the saints, as well as others who helped the apostle and laboured.<a name=209:15></a> Paul exhorts the faithful to submit themselves to such, and to all those who helped in the work and laboured.<a name=209:16></a> He would also have them acknowledge those who refreshed his heart by their service of devotedness.<a name=209:17></a> Thus we find the

		simple and important principle according to which all the best affections of the heart are developed, namely, the acknowledgment of every one according to the manifestation of grace and of the power of the Holy Ghost in him.<a name=210:1></a> The christian man submits to those who addict themselves to the service of the saints; he acknowledges those who manifest grace in a special way.<a name=210:2></a> They are not persons officially nominated and consecrated who are spoken of here.<a name=210:3></a> It is the conscience and the spiritual affection of Christians which acknowledges them according to their work -- a principle valid at all times, which does not permit this respect to be demanded, but which requires it to be paid.<a name=210:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may remark, here, that this epistle, although entering into all the details of the interior conduct of an assembly, does not speak of elders or of any formally established officers at all.<a name=210:5></a> It is certain, that in general there were such; but God has provided in the word for the walk of an assembly at all times, and, as we see, principles which oblige us to acknowledge those who serve in it through personal devotedness without being officially appointed.<a name=210:6></a> General unfaithfulness, or the absence of such established officers, will not prevent those who obey the word from following it in all that is needful for christian order.<a name=210:7></a> We see moreover that, whatever might be the disorder, the apostle recognises the members of the assembly as being all real Christians; he desires them to acknowledge one another by the kiss of love, the universal expression of brotherly affection.<a name=210:8></a> This is so entirely the case that he pronounces a solemn anathema on every one who loved not the Lord Jesus.<a name=210:9></a> There might be such, but he would in no way recognise them.<a name=210:10></a> If there were any, let them be anathema.<a name=210:11></a> Is this an allowed mixture?<a name=210:12></a> He will not believe it, and he embraces them all in the bonds of christian love (verse 24).<a name=210:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The last point is important.<a name=210:14></a> The state of the assembly at Corinth might give room for some uncertainty as to the Christianity of certain members, or persons in connection with them although not dwelling at Corinth.<a name=210:15></a> He admonishes them; but in fact, in cases of the most grievous sin where the discipline of God was exercised, or that of man was required, the guilty are looked upon as Christians.<a name=210:16></a> (See chapter 10 for the warning; chapter 11: 32 for the Lord's discipline; for that of man, chapter 5: 5 in this epistle; for the principle, <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#2:8">2 Corinthians  2:8</a>).<a name=210:17></a> Besides, he denounces with an anathema those

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is sweet to see that, after faithfully (although with anguish of heart) correcting every abuse, the spirit of the apostle returns by grace into the enjoyments of charity in his relationship with the Corinthians.<a name=211:4></a> The terrible verse 22 was not felt to be inconsistent with the love that dictated the other verses.<a name=211:5></a> It was the same spirit, for Christ was the sole spring of his charity.<a name=211:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may notice (verse 21) that the apostle, as other passages testify, employed some one to write for him.<a name=211:7></a> The Epistle to the Galatians is an exception.<a name=211:8></a> He verified his epistles to the assemblies by writing the salutation at the end with his own hand, marking the importance he attached to the exactitude of the verbal contents, and confirming the principle of an exact inspiration.<a name=211:9></a> His heart flows out (verse 24), and he comforts himself in being able to acknowledge them all in love.<a name=211:10></a>

		The apostle writes the second Epistle to the Corinthians under the influence of the consolations of Christ -- consolations experienced when the troubles which came upon him in Asia were at their height; and renewed at the moment when he wrote his letter, by the good news which Titus had brought him from Corinth -- consolations which (now that he is happy about them) he imparts to the Corinthians; who, by grace, had been their source in the last instance.<a name=212:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first letter had awakened their conscience, and had re-established the fear of God in their heart, and integrity in their walk.<a name=212:2></a> The sorrowing heart of the apostle was revived by hearing this good news.<a name=212:3></a> The state of the Corinthians had cast him down and a little removed from his heart the feelings produced by the consolations with which Jesus filled it during his trials at Ephesus.<a name=212:4></a> How various and complicated are the exercises of him who serves Christ and cares for souls!<a name=212:5></a> The spiritual restoration of the Corinthians, by dissipating Paul's anguish, had renewed the joy of these consolations, which the tidings of their misconduct had interrupted.<a name=212:6></a> He afterwards returns to this subject of his sufferings at Ephesus; and develops, in a remarkable way, the power of the life by which he lived in Christ.<a name=212:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He addresses all the saints of that country, as well as those in the city of Corinth, which was its capital; and, being led by the Holy Ghost to write according to the real sentiments which that Spirit produced in him, he at once places himself in the midst of the consolations which flowed into his heart, in order to acknowledge in them the God who poured them into his tried and exercised spirit.<a name=212:8></a>

		Nothing more touching than the work of the Spirit in the apostle's heart.<a name=212:9></a> The mixture of gratitude and worship towards God, of joy in the consolations of Christ, and of affection for those on whose account he now rejoiced, has a beauty entirely inimitable by the mind of man.<a name=212:10></a> Its simplicity and its truth do but enhance the excellence and exalted character of this divine work in a human heart.<a name=212:11></a> "Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort, who comforteth us in all our tribulation,

		Observe here the admirable connection between the personal circumstances of God's labourers, and the work to which they are called, and even the circumstances of that work.<a name=214:2></a> The first epistle had produced that salutary effect on the Corinthians to which the apostle, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, had destined it.<a name=214:3></a> Their conscience had been awakened, and they had become zealous against the evil in proportion to the depth of their fall.<a name=214:4></a> This is always the effect of the work of the Spirit, when the conscience of the Christian who has fallen is really touched.<a name=214:5></a> The apostle's heart can open with joy to their complete and sincere obedience.<a name=214:6></a> Meanwhile he had himself passed through terrible trials, so that he had despaired of life; and he had been able through grace to realise the power of that life in Christ which gained the victory over death, and could pour abundantly into the hearts of the Corinthians the consolations of that life, which were to raise them up again.<a name=214:7></a> There is a God who conducts all things in the service of His saints -- the sorrow through which they pass, as all the rest.<a name=214:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Observe, also, that he does not need to begin by reminding the Corinthians, as he had done in the first epistle, of their calling and their privileges as sanctified in Christ.<a name=214:9></a> He breaks out in thanksgiving to the God of all consolation.<a name=214:10></a> Holiness is brought forward when it is practically wanting among the saints.<a name=214:11></a> If they are walking in holiness, they enjoy God, and they speak of Him.<a name=214:12></a> The way in which the various parts of the work of God are linked together, in and by means of the apostle, is seen in the expressions that flow from his grateful heart.<a name=214:13></a> God comforts him in his sufferings; and the consolation is such that it is suited to comfort others, in whatsoever affliction it may be; for it is God Himself who is the consolation, by pouring into the heart His love and His communion, as it is enjoyed in Christ.<a name=214:14></a>

		This was Paul's confidence with regard to his ministry; his competency came from God for the ministry of the new covenant, not of the letter (not even the letter of this covenant, any more than the letter of anything else) but of the Spirit, the true force of the purpose of God, as the Spirit gave it.<a name=220:2></a> For the letter kills, as a rule imposed on man; the Spirit quickens, as the power of God in grace -- the purpose of God communicated to the heart of man by the power of God, who imparted it to him that he might enjoy it.<a name=220:3></a> Now the subject of this ministry brought out the difference between it and the ministry of the law yet more strongly.<a name=220:4></a> The law, graven on stones, had been introduced with glory, although it was a thing that was to pass away as a means of relation between God and men.<a name=220:5></a> It was a ministry of death, for they were only to live by keeping it.<a name=220:6></a> Nor could it be otherwise ordered than on this principle.<a name=220:7></a> A law was to be kept; but man being already a sinner by nature and by will, having desires which the law forbade, that law could only be death to him -- it was a ministry of death.<a name=220:8></a> It was a ministry of condemnation because the authority of God came in to give to the law the sanction of condemnation against every soul that should break it.<a name=220:9></a> It was a ministry of death and of condemnation because man was a sinner.<a name=220:10></a>

		There are many Christians who make a law of Christ Himself, and in thinking of His love as a fresh motive to oblige them to love Him, think of it only as an obligation, a very great increase to the measure of the obligation which lies upon them, an obligation which they feel bound to satisfy.<a name=221:5></a> That is to say, they are still under the law, and consequently under condemnation.<a name=221:6></a>

		But the ministry which the apostle fulfilled was not this; it was the ministry of righteousness and of the Spirit, not as requiring righteousness in order to stand before God, but as revealing it.<a name=221:7></a> Christ was this righteousness, made such on God's part for us; and we are made the righteousness of God in Him.<a name=221:8></a> The gospel proclaimed righteousness on God's part, instead of requiring it from man according to the law.<a name=221:9></a> Now the Holy Ghost could be the seal of that righteousness.<a name=221:10></a> He could come down upon the man Christ, because He was perfectly approved of God; He was righteous -- the righteous One.<a name=221:11></a> He came down upon us, because we are made the righteousness of God in Christ.<a name=221:12></a> Thus it was the ministry of the Spirit; His power wrought in it.<a name=221:13></a> He was bestowed when that which it announced was received by faith; and with the Spirit they also received understanding of the mind and purposes of God, as they were revealed in the Person of a glorified Christ, in whom the righteousness of God was revealed and subsisted eternally before Him.<a name=221:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Nevertheless something else was necessary to our enjoying this, since we are not yet glorified in fact; and God has given it -- the earnest of the Spirit.<a name=228:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus, we have the glory before us, we are wrought for it by God Himself, and we have the earnest of the Spirit till we are there, and know that Christ has so entirely overcome death that, if the time were come, we should be transformed into glory without dying at all.<a name=228:6></a> Mortality would be swallowed up of life.<a name=228:7></a> This is our portion through grace in the last Adam, through the power of life in which Christ was raised.<a name=228:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But next the apostle will treat of the effect as to the natural portion of the first fallen man, death and judgment; for the testimony here is very complete.<a name=228:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What then is the effect of the possession of life in Christ as applied to death and judgment, the two natural objects of men's fears, the fruit of sin?<a name=228:10></a> If our bodies are not yet transformed; and if that which is mortal is not yet swallowed up, we are equally full of confidence, because, being formed for glory, and Christ (who has manifested the victorious power that opened the path of heaven to Him) being our life, if we should leave this tabernacle and be absent from the body before we are clothed upon with the glory, this life remains untouched; it has already in Jesus triumphed over all these effects of the power of death.<a name=228:11></a> We should be present with the Lord; for we walk by faith, not by the sight of these excellent things.<a name=228:12></a> Therefore we prefer to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.<a name=228:13></a> For this reason we seek to be well-pleasing to Him, whether we are found absent from this body, or present in this body, when Christ shall come to take us to Himself and make us share His glory.<a name=228:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And this leads on to the second point -- judgment.<a name=228:15></a> For we must all be manifested before the tribunal of Christ, in order that each may receive according to that which he shall have done in the body, be it good or evil.<a name=228:16></a> A happy and precious

		But there is another idea in the passage -- retribution.<a name=230:5></a> The apostle does not speak of judgment on persons, because the saints are included, and Christ has stood in their place for all that regards the judgment of their persons: "There is no condemnation for those who are in Christ".<a name=230:6></a> They do not come into judgment.<a name=230:7></a> But they shall be manifested before His tribunal, and receive that which they have done in the body.<a name=230:8></a> The good deserves nothing: they received that by which they have wrought what is good -- grace produced it in them; nevertheless they shall receive its reward.<a name=230:9></a> What they have done is counted as their own act.<a name=230:10></a> If, by neglecting grace and the witness of the Spirit in them, the fruits which He would have produced have been turned aside, they will bear the consequences.<a name=230:11></a> It is not that, in this case, God will have forsaken them; it is not that the Holy Ghost will not act in them with regard to the condition they are in; but it will be in their conscience that He acts, judging the flesh which has prevented the man's bearing the natural fruit of His presence and operation in the new man.<a name=230:12></a> So that the Holy Ghost will have done all that is necessary with respect to their state of heart; and the perfect counsel of God with regard to the person will have been accomplished, His patience manifested, His wisdom, His ways in governing, the care which He deigns to take of each one individually in His most condescending love.<a name=230:13></a> Each one will have his place, as it was prepared for him of the Father.<a name=230:14></a> But the natural fruit of the presence and operation of the Holy Ghost in a soul which has (or, according to the advantages it has enjoyed, ought to have had) a certain measure of light, will not have been produced.<a name=230:15></a> It will be seen what it was that prevented.<a name=230:16></a> It will judge, according to the judgment of God, all that was good and evil in itself, with a solemn reverence for that which God is, and a fervent adoration on account of what He has been for us.<a name=230:17></a> The perfect light will be appreciated; the ways of God known and understood in all their perfection, by the application of the perfect light to the whole course of our life and of His dealings with us, in which we shall thoroughly

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus the majesty of God will have been maintained by His judgment, at the same time that the perfection and tenderness of His dealings will be the eternal recollection of our souls.<a name=231:2></a> Light without cloud or darkness will be understood in its own perfection.<a name=231:3></a> To understand it is to be in it and to enjoy it.<a name=231:4></a> And light is God Himself.<a name=231:5></a> How wonderful to be thus manifested!<a name=231:6></a> What love is that which in its perfect wisdom, in its marvellous ways overruling all evil, could bring such beings as we are to enjoy this unclouded light -- beings knowing good and evil (the natural prerogative of those only of whom God can say "one of us"), under the yoke of the evil which they knew, and driven out by a bad conscience from the presence of God, to whom that knowledge belonged, having testimony enough in their conscience as to the judgment of God, to make them avoid Him and be miserable, but nothing to draw them to Him who alone could find a remedy!<a name=231:7></a> What love and holy wisdom which could bring such to the source of good, of pure happiness, in whom the power of good repels absolutely the evil which it judges!<a name=231:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		However great the happiness of being in the perfect light (and this happiness is complete and divine in its character), it is on the side of conscience that the subject is here presented.<a name=231:10></a> God maintains His majesty by the judgment which He executes, as it is written, "The Lord is known by the judgment that he executeth": there, in His government of the world; here, final, eternal, and personal judgment.<a name=231:11></a> And, for my part, I believe that it is very profitable for the soul to have the judgment of God present to our minds, and the sense of the unchangeable majesty of God maintained in the conscience by this means.<a name=231:12></a> If we were not under grace, it would be -- it ought to be -- insupportable; but the maintenance of this sentiment does not contradict grace.<a name=231:13></a> It is indeed only under grace that it can be maintained in its truth; for who otherwise could bear the thought, for an instant, of receiving that which he had done in the body?<a name=231:14></a> None but he who is completely blinded.<a name=231:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But the authority, the holy authority of God, which asserts itself in judgment, forms a part of our relationship with Him;
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=232>[Page 232]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the maintenance of this sentiment, associated with the full enjoyment of grace, a part of our holy spiritual affections.<a name=232:1></a> It is the fear of the Lord.<a name=232:2></a> It is in this sense, that "Happy is he who feareth always".<a name=232:3></a> If this weakens the conviction that the love of God rests fully, eternally, upon us, then we get off the only possible ground of any relation whatever with God, unless perdition could be so called.<a name=232:4></a> But, in the sweet and peaceful atmosphere of grace, conscience maintains its rights and its authority against the subtle encroachments of the flesh, through the sense of God's judgment, in virtue of a holiness which cannot be separated from the character of God without denying that there is a God: for if there is a God, He is holy.<a name=232:5></a> This sentiment engages the heart of the accepted believer, to endeavour to please the Lord in every way; and, in the sense of how solemn a thing it is for a sinner to appear before God, the love that necessarily accompanies it in a believer's heart urges him to persuade men with a view to their salvation, while maintaining his own conscience in the light.<a name=232:6></a> And he who is now walking in the light, whose conscience reflects that light, will not fear it in the day when it shall appear in its glory.<a name=232:7></a> We must be manifested; but, walking in the light in the sense of the fear of God, realising His judgment of evil, we are already manifested to God: nothing hinders the sweet and assured flow of His love.<a name=232:8></a> Accordingly the walk of such a one justifies itself in the end to the consciences of others; one is manifested as walking in the light.<a name=232:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These are therefore the two great practical principles of the ministry: to walk in the light, in the sense of God's solemn judgment for every one; and, the conscience being thus pure in the light, the sense of the judgment (which in this case cannot trouble the soul for itself, or obscure its view of the love of God) impels the heart to seek in love those who are in danger of this judgment.<a name=232:10></a> This connects itself with the doctrine of Christ, the Saviour, through His death upon the cross; and the love of Christ constrains us, because we see that, if one died for all, it is that all were dead.<a name=232:11></a> This was the universal condition of souls.<a name=232:12></a> The apostle seeks them in order that they may live unto God by Christ.<a name=232:13></a> But this goes farther.<a name=232:14></a> First, as regards fallen man's lot, death is gain.<a name=232:15></a> The saint, if absent from the body, is present with the Lord.<a name=232:16></a> As to judgment, he owns the solemnity of it, but it does not make him tremble.<a name=232:17></a> He is in Christ -- will be like Christ; and Christ, before whom he is to

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The work of manifestation before God in the light is already true, in so far as we have realised the light.<a name=233:9></a> Cannot I, being now in peace, look back at what I was before conversion, and at all my failures since my conversion, humbled but adoring the grace of God in all He has done for me, but without a thought of fear, or imputation of sin?<a name=233:10></a> Does not this awaken a very deep sense of all that God is in holy grace and love, in unbounded patience towards me, both keeping and helping and restoring?<a name=233:11></a> Such will be the case perfectly when we are manifested, when we shall know as we are known.<a name=233:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That this point may be still more clear, for it is an important one, let me add some further observations here.<a name=233:13></a> What we find in this passage is the perfect manifestation of all that a person is and has been before a throne characterised by judgment, without judgment as to the person in question being guilty.<a name=233:14></a> No doubt when the wicked receives the things done in the body, he is condemned.<a name=233:15></a> But it is not said "judged" here, because all then must be condemned.<a name=233:16></a> But this manifestation is exactly what brings all morally before the heart, when it is capable of judging evil for itself: were it under judgment, it could not.<a name=233:17></a> Freed from all fear, and in the perfect light and with the comfort of perfect love (for where we have the conscience of sin, and of its not being imputed, we have the sense, though in a humbling way, of perfect love), and at the same time the sense of authority and divine government fully made good

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have to remember that, at our appearing before the judgment-seat of Christ, we are already glorified.<a name=234:3></a> Christ has come Himself in perfect love to fetch us; and has changed our vile body according to the resemblance of His glorious body.<a name=234:4></a> We are glorified and like Christ before the judgment takes place.<a name=234:5></a> And mark the effect on Paul.<a name=234:6></a> Does the thought of being manifested awaken anxiety or dread?<a name=234:7></a> Not the least.<a name=234:8></a> He realises all the solemnity of such a process.<a name=234:9></a> He knows the terror of the Lord; he has it before his eyes; and what is the consequence?<a name=234:10></a> He sets about to persuade others who are in need of it.<a name=234:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There are, so to speak, two parts in God's nature and character: His righteousness, which judges everything; and His perfect love.<a name=234:12></a> These are one for us in Christ, ours in Christ.<a name=234:13></a> If indeed we realise what God is, both will have their place: but the believer in Christ is the righteousness which God, from His very nature, must have before Him on His throne, if we are to be with Him and enjoy Him.<a name=234:14></a> But the Christ, in the judgment-seat, before whom we are, is our righteousness.<a name=234:15></a> He judges by the righteousness which He is; but we are that righteousness, the righteousness of God in Him.<a name=234:16></a> Hence this point can raise no question in the soul, will make us adore such grace, but can raise no question, only enhance the sense we have of grace ourselves, make us understand it, as suited to man as he is, and feel the solemn and awful consequences of not having part in it, since there is such a judgment.<a name=234:17></a> Hence that other and indeed essential part of the divine nature, love, will work in us towards others; and, knowing the terror of the Lord, we shall persuade men.<a name=234:18></a> Thus Paul (it is conscience in view of that most solemn moment) possessed the righteousness which he saw in the Judge, for that which judged was His righteousness; but then he consequently seeks others earnestly, according to the work which had thus brought him near to God, to which he then turns (verse 13, 14).<a name=234:19></a> But this view of judgment and our complete manifestation in that day, has a present effect on the saint according to its own nature.<a name=234:20></a> He realises it by faith.<a name=234:21></a> He is manifested.<a name=234:22></a> He does not fear being manifested.<a name=234:23></a> It will unfold all God's past ways towards him when he is in glory; but he is manifested now to God, his conscience

		Observe here the assemblage of powerful motives, of pre-eminently important principles; contradictory in appearance, but which, to a soul which walks in light, instead of clashing and destroying each other, unite to give its complete and thoroughly furnished character to the christian minister and ministry.<a name=235:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First of all, the glory, in such a power of life, that he who realises it does not desire death, because he sees in the power of life in Christ that which can absorb whatever in him is mortal, and he sees it with the certainty of enjoying it -- such a consciousness of possessing this life (God having formed him for it, and given him the earnest of the Spirit), that death if it arrive to him is but a happy absence from the body in order to be present with the Lord.<a name=235:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the thought of ascending to Christ gives the desire of being acceptable to Him, and presents Him (the second motive or principle that gives a form to this ministry) as the Judge who will render to every one that which he has done.<a name=235:5></a> The solemn thought of how much this judgment is to be feared takes possession of the apostle's heart.<a name=235:6></a> What a difference between this thought and the "building of God", for which he was waiting with certainty!<a name=235:7></a> Nevertheless this thought does not alarm him; but, in the solemn sense of the reality of that judgment, it impels him to persuade others.<a name=235:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But here a third principle comes in, the love of Christ with reference to the condition of those whom Paul sought to persuade.<a name=235:9></a> Since this love of Christ's shews itself in His death, there is in it the witness that all were already dead and lost.<a name=235:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we have here set before us glory, with the personal certainty of enjoying it, and death become the means of being present with the Lord; the tribunal of Christ, and the necessity of being manifested before it; and the love of Christ in His death, all being already dead.<a name=235:11></a> How are such diverse principles as these to be reconciled and arranged in the heart?<a name=235:12></a> It is that the apostle was manifested to God.<a name=235:13></a> Hence the thought of being manifested before the tribunal produced, along with the present sanctification, no other effect on him than that of solemnity, for he was not to come into judgment; but it became an urgent motive for preaching to others, according to the love which Christ had manifested in His death.<a name=235:14></a> The idea of the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What a marvellous combination of motives we find in this passage, to form a ministry characterised by the development of all that in which God reveals Himself, and by which He acts on the heart and conscience of man!<a name=236:4></a> And it is in a pure conscience that these things can have their force together.<a name=236:5></a> If the conscience were not pure, the tribunal would obscure the glory, at least as belonging to oneself, and weaken the sense of His love.<a name=236:6></a> At any rate one would be occupied with self in connection with these things, and ought to be so.<a name=236:7></a> But when pure before God, it only sees a tribunal which excites no sense of personal uneasiness, and therefore has all its true moral effect, as an additional motive for seriousness in our walk, and a solemn energy in the appeal which the known love of Jesus impels it to address to man.<a name=236:8></a>

		As to how far our own relations with God enter into the service which we have to render to others, the apostle adds another thing that characterised his walk, and that was the result of the death and resurrection of Christ.<a name=236:9></a> He lived in an entirely new sphere, in a new creation, which had left behind, as in another world, all that belonged to a natural existence in the flesh here below.<a name=236:10></a> The proof that Christ had died for all proved that all were dead; and that He died for all in order that those who live should live no longer to themselves but to Him who died for them and rose again.<a name=236:11></a> They are in connection with this new order of things in which Christ exists as risen.<a name=236:12></a> Death is on everything else.<a name=236:13></a> Everything is shut up under death.<a name=236:14></a> If I live, I live in a new order of things, in a new creation, of which Christ is the type and the head.<a name=236:15></a> Christ, so far as in connection with this world below, is dead.<a name=236:16></a> He might have been known as the Messiah, living on the earth, and in connection with promises made to men living on the earth in the flesh.<a name=236:17></a> The apostle no longer knew Him thus.<a name=236:18></a> In fact

		God left this task to Satan, as He used him for the humiliation of Job.<a name=249:22></a> Whatever graces may be bestowed on us, we must go through the ordinary exercises of personal faith, in which the heart only walks safely when the flesh is bridled, and so practically nullified, that we are not conscious of it as active in us when we wish to be wholly given to God, and to think of Him and with Him according to our measure.<a name=249:23></a>

		Finally, observe that the humiliation needed to reduce the rebellious flesh to its nothingness is used by Christ to display His power in it.<a name=251:7></a> Thus humbled, we learn our dependence.<a name=251:8></a> All that is of us, all that constitutes self, is a hindrance; the infirmity is that in which it is put down, laid low, in which weakness is realised.<a name=251:9></a> The power of Christ is perfected in it.<a name=251:10></a> It is a general principle; humanly speaking, the cross was weakness.<a name=251:11></a> Death is the opposite of the strength of man.<a name=251:12></a> Nevertheless it is in it that the strength of Christ revealed itself.<a name=251:13></a> In it He accomplished His glorious work of salvation.<a name=251:14></a>

		It is not sin in the flesh that is the subject here when infirmity is spoken of, but what is contrary to the strength of man.<a name=251:15></a> Christ never leant on human strength for a moment; He lived by the Father, who had sent Him.<a name=251:16></a> The power of the Holy Ghost alone was displayed in Him.<a name=251:17></a> Paul needed to have the flesh reduced to weakness, in order that there might not be in it the motion of sin which was natural to it.<a name=251:18></a> When the flesh was reduced to its true nothingness as far as good is concerned, and in a manifest way, then Christ could display His strength in it.<a name=251:19></a> That strength had its true character.<a name=251:20></a> Remark it well: that is always its character -- strength made perfect in infirmity.<a name=251:21></a> The blessed apostle could glory in a man in Christ above, enjoying all this beatitude, these marvellous things which shut out self, so much were they above all we are.<a name=251:22></a> While enjoying them, he was not conscious of the existence of his body.<a name=251:23></a> When

		Thus, as at the beginning of the epistle we had the true characteristics of the ministry in connection with the objects that gave it that character, so we have here its practical strength, and the source of that strength, in connection with the vessel in which the testimony was deposited, the way in which this ministry was exercised by bringing a mortal man into connection with the ineffable sources from which it flowed, and with the living, present, active energy of Christ, so that the man should be capable of it, and yet that he should not accomplish it in his own carnal strength -- a thing moreover impossible in itself.<a name=252:10></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#46:252">footnote</a></i>)

	<div class="paragraph">
		Is it then that the apostle took the Corinthians for judges of his conduct?<a name=253:13></a> He spoke before God in Christ; and only feared lest, when he came, he should find many of those who professed the name of Christ like the world of iniquity that surrounded them; and that he should be humbled amongst them, and have to bewail many who had already sinned and had not repented of their misdeeds.<a name=253:14></a>

		For the third time he was coming.<a name=253:15></a> Everything should be proved by the testimony of two or three witnesses; and this time he would not spare.<a name=253:16></a> The apostle says, "This is the third time I am coming"; yet he adds, "as if I were present the second time, and being absent now".<a name=253:17></a> This is, because he had been there once, was to have gone there on his way to Macedonia, was coming a second time, but did not on account of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He then puts an end to the question about his ministry by presenting an idea which ought to confound them utterly.<a name=254:2></a> If Christ had not spoken by him, Christ did not dwell in them.<a name=254:3></a> If Christ was in them, He must have spoken by the apostle, for he had been the means of their conversion.<a name=254:4></a> "Since", he says, "ye seek a proof that Christ speaketh in me, examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith.<a name=254:5></a> Do ye not know yourselves, that Christ dwelleth in you, unless ye be reprobates?<a name=254:6></a>" and that they did not at all think.<a name=254:7></a> This was quite upsetting them, and turning their foolish and stupid opposition, their unbecoming contempt of the apostle, to their own confusion.<a name=254:8></a> What folly to allow themselves to be led away by a thought which, no doubt, exalted them in their own eyes; but which, by calling in question the apostleship of Paul, necessarily overturned, at the same time, their own Christianity!<a name=254:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		From "which to you-ward is not weak" to the end of verse 4 is a parenthesis, referring to the character of his ministry, according to the principles brought forward in the previous chapter: weakness, and that which tended to contempt, on the side of man; power on God's part: even as Christ was crucified in weakness and was raised again by divine power.<a name=254:10></a> If the apostle himself was weak, it was in Christ; and he lived in Him, by the power of God, towards the Corinthians.<a name=254:11></a> Whatever might be the case with them, he trusted they should know that he was not reprobate; and he only prayed to God that they should do no evil, not in order that he should not be reprobate (that is, worthless in his ministry, for here he is speaking of ministry), but that they might do good even if he were reprobate.<a name=254:12></a> For he could do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.<a name=254:13></a> He was not master of the Corinthians for his own interest, but was content to be weak that they might be strong; for what he desired was their perfection.<a name=254:14></a> But he wrote, being absent, as he had said, in order that when present he might not be obliged to act with severity, according to the authority which the Lord had given him for edification, and not for destruction.<a name=254:15></a>

		GALATIANS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The epistle to the Galatians sets before us the great source of the afflictions and conflicts of the apostle in the regions where he had preached the glad tidings; that which was at the same time the principal means employed by the enemy to corrupt the gospel.<a name=256:1></a> God, it is true, in His love, has suited the gospel to the wants of man.<a name=256:2></a> The enemy brings down that which still bears its name to the level of the haughty will of man and the corruption of the natural heart, turning Christianity into a religion that suits that heart, in place of one that is the expression of the heart of God -- an all-holy God -- and the revelation of that which He has done in His love to bring us into communion with His holiness.<a name=256:3></a> We see, at the same time, the connection between the judaising doctrine -- which is the denial of full redemption, and looking for good in flesh and man's will, power in man to work out righteousness in himself for God -- in those who hindered the apostle's work, and the attacks that were constantly aimed against his ministry; because that ministry appealed directly to the power of the Holy Ghost and to the immediate authority of a glorified Christ, and set man as ruined, and Judaism which dealt with man, wholly aside.<a name=256:4></a> In withstanding the efforts of the judaisers, the apostle necessarily establishes the elementary principles of justification by grace.<a name=256:5></a> Traces both of this combat with the spirit of Judaism, by which Satan endeavoured to destroy true Christianity, and of the maintenance by the apostle of this liberty, and of the authority of his ministry, are found in a multitude of passages in Corinthians, in Philippians, in Colossians, in Timothy, and historically in the Acts.<a name=256:6></a> In Galatians the two subjects are treated in a direct and formal way.<a name=256:7></a> But the gospel is consequently reduced to its most simple elements, grace to its most simple expression.<a name=256:8></a> But, with regard to the error, the question is but the more decisively settled; the irreconcilable difference between the two principles, Judaism and the gospel, is the more strongly marked.<a name=256:9></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle begins, at the very outset, with the independence, as to all other men, of the ministry which he exercised, pointing out its true source, from which he received it without the intervention of any intermediate instrument whatsoever: adding, in order to shew that the Galatians were forsaking the common faith of the saints, "all the brethren which are with me".<a name=257:3></a> Also, in opening the subject of his epistle, the apostle declares at once, that the doctrine introduced by the judaisers among the Galatians was a different gospel (but which was not really another), not the gospel of Christ.<a name=257:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He begins then by declaring that he is not an apostle either of men or by man.<a name=257:5></a> He does not come on the part of men as though sent by them, and it is not by means of any man that he had received his commission, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised Him from the dead.<a name=257:6></a> It was by Jesus Christ, on the way to Damascus; and by the Father, it appears to me, when the Holy Ghost said, "Separate to me Barnabas and Paul".<a name=257:7></a> But he speaks thus, in order to carry up the origin of his ministry to the primary source of all real good, and of all legitimate authority.<a name=257:8></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#46:257">footnote</a></i>)

		The apostle, with touching tenderness, as it appears to me, does not answer this question -- does not deduce the necessary consequences of his argument.<a name=269:1></a> His object was to shew the difference between the promise and the law, without needlessly wounding the heart of a people whom he loved.<a name=269:2></a> On the contrary, he endeavours at once to prevent any offence that might arise from what he had said; further developing at the same time his thesis.<a name=269:3></a> Was the law against the promises of God?<a name=269:4></a> By no means.<a name=269:5></a> If a law had been given that was to impart life, then righteousness (for that is our subject in this passage) should have been by the law.<a name=269:6></a> Man, possessing divine life, would have been righteous in the righteousness that he had accomplished.<a name=269:7></a> The law promised the blessing of God on the terms of man's obedience: if it could have given life at the same time, this obedience would have taken place, righteousness would have been accomplished on the ground of law; they to whom the promise had been made would have enjoyed its fulfilment by virtue of their own righteousness.<a name=269:8></a> But it was the contrary which happened, for after all man, whether Jew or Gentile, is a sinner by nature; without law, he is the slave of his unbridled passions; under law, he shews their strength by breaking the law.<a name=269:9></a> The scripture has shut up all under sin, in order that this promise, by faith in Jesus Christ, should be accomplished in favour of those who believe.<a name=269:10></a>

		Now before faith came (that is, christian faith, as the principle of relationship with God, before the existence of the positive objects of faith in the Person, the work, and the glory of Christ as man, had become the means of establishing the faith of the gospel), the Jews were kept under the law, shut up with a view to the enjoyment of this privilege which was to come.<a name=269:11></a> Thus the law had been to the Jews as a child's conductor up to Christ, in order that they might be justified on the principle of faith.<a name=269:12></a> Meanwhile they were not without restraint; they were kept apart from the nations, not less guilty than they, but kept separate for a justification, the necessity of which was made more evident by the law which they did not fulfil, but which demanded righteousness from man; thus shewing that God required this righteousness.<a name=269:13></a> But when once faith had come, those until then subject to the law were no longer under the tutelage of this law, which only bound them until faith was come.<a name=269:14></a> For this faith, placing man immediately in the presence of God, and making the believer a son of the Father of glory,

		The relative position therefore of the Jew (even though he were godly) before the coming of Christ, and of the believing Jew or Gentile when Christ had been revealed, is clearly set forth; and in the commencement of chapter 4 the apostle sums up that which he had said.<a name=270:6></a> He compares the believer before the coming of Christ to a child under age, who has no direct relation with his father as to his thoughts, but who receives his father's orders, without his accounting for them to him, as a servant would receive them.<a name=270:7></a> He is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.<a name=270:8></a> Thus the Jews, although they were heirs of the promises, were not in connection with the Father and His counsels in Jesus, but were in tutelage to principles that appertained to the system of the present world, which is but a corrupt and fallen creation.<a name=270:9></a> Their walk was ordained of God in this system, but did not go beyond it.<a name=270:10></a> We speak of the system by which they were guided, whatever divine light they might receive from time to time to reveal heaven to them, to encourage them in hope, while making the system under the rule of which they were placed yet darker.<a name=270:11></a> Under the law then, heirs as they were, they were still in bondage.<a name=270:12></a> But when the time was fulfilled and ripe for it, God sent forth His Son -- an act flowing from His sovereign goodness for the accomplishment of His eternal counsels, and for the manifestation of all His character.<a name=270:13></a> It was God who did it.<a name=270:14></a> It was He who acted.<a name=270:15></a> The law required man to act, and it manifested man to be just the contrary of that which he ought to have been according to the law.<a name=270:16></a> But the

	<div class="paragraph">
		The epistle to the Ephesians gives us the richest exposition of the blessings of the saints individually, and of the assembly, setting forth at the same time the counsels of God with regard to the glory of Christ.<a name=283:1></a> Christ Himself is viewed as the One who is to hold all things united in one under His hand, as Head of the assembly.<a name=283:2></a> We see the assembly placed in the most intimate relationship with Him, as those who compose it are with the Father Himself, and in the heavenly position dispensed to her by the sovereign grace of God.<a name=283:3></a> Now these ways of grace to her reveal God Himself, and in two distinct characters; as well in connection with Christ as with Christians.<a name=283:4></a> He is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=283:5></a> He is the God of Christ, when Christ is looked at as man; the Father of Christ when Christ is looked at as the Son of His love.<a name=283:6></a> In the first character the nature of God is revealed; in the second, we see the intimate relationship which we enjoy to Him who bears this character of Father, and that according to the excellence of Christ's own relationship to Him.<a name=283:7></a> It is this relationship to the Father, as well as that in which we stand to Christ as His body and His bride, that is the source of blessing to the saints and to the assembly of God, of which grace has made us members as a whole.<a name=283:8></a>

		required any particular remarks adapted to that state.<a name=284:1></a> It is nearness of heart to God that produces simplicity, and that enables us in simplicity to enjoy the blessings of God as God Himself bestows them, as they flow from His heart, in all their own excellence -- to enjoy them in connection with Him who imparts them, and not merely in a mode adapted to the state of those to whom they are imparted; or through a communication that only reveals a part of these blessings, because the soul would not be able to receive more.<a name=284:2></a> Yes, when near to God, we are in simplicity, and the whole extent of His grace and of our blessings unfolds itself as it is found in Him.<a name=284:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is important to remark two things here in passing: first, that moral nearness to God, and communion with Him, is the only means of any true enlargement in the knowledge of His ways and of the blessings which He imparts to His children, because it is the only position in which we can perceive them, or be morally capable of so doing; and, also, that all conduct which is not suitable to this nearness to God, all levity of thought, which His presence does not admit of, makes us lose these communications from Him and renders us incapable of receiving them.<a name=284:4></a> (Compare <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:21">John  14:21</a> - 23).<a name=284:5></a> Secondly, it is not that the Lord forsakes us on account of these faults or this carelessness; He intercedes for us, and we experience His grace, but it is no longer communion or intelligent progress in the riches of the revelation of Himself, of the fulness which is in Christ.<a name=284:6></a> It is grace adapted to our wants, an answer to our misery.<a name=284:7></a> Jesus stretches out His hand to us according to the need that we feel -- need produced in our hearts by the operation of the Holy Ghost.<a name=284:8></a> This is infinitely precious grace, a sweet experience of His faithfulness and love: we learn by this means to discern good and evil by judging self; but the grace had to be adapted to our wants, and to receive a character according to those wants, as an answer made to them; we have had to think of ourselves.<a name=284:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In a case like this the Holy Ghost occupies us with ourselves (in grace, no doubt), and when we have lost communion with God, we cannot neglect this turning back upon ourselves without deceiving and hardening ourselves.<a name=284:10></a> Alas!<a name=284:11></a> the dealings of many souls with Christ hardly go beyond this character.<a name=284:12></a> It is with all too often the case.<a name=284:13></a> In a word, when this happens the thought of sin having been admitted into the heart, our dealings with the Lord to be true must be on the ground of this

		sad admission of sin (in thought, at least).<a name=285:1></a> It is grace alone which allows us again to have to do with God.<a name=285:2></a> The fact that He restores us enhances His grace in our eyes; but this is not communion.<a name=285:3></a> When we walk with God, when we walk after the Spirit without grieving Him, He maintains us in communion, in the enjoyment of God, the positive source of joy -- of an everlasting joy.<a name=285:4></a> This is a position in which He can occupy us -- as being ourselves interested in all that interests Him -- with all the development of His counsels, His glory, and His goodness, in the Person of Jesus the Christ, Jesus the Son of His love; and the heart is enlarged in the measure of the objects that occupy it.<a name=285:5></a> This is our normal condition.<a name=285:6></a> This, in the main, was the case with the Ephesians.<a name=285:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We have already remarked, that Paul was specially gifted of God to communicate His counsels and His ways in Christ; as John was gifted to reveal His character and life as it was manifested in Jesus.<a name=285:8></a> The result of this particular gift in our apostle is naturally found in the epistle we are considering.<a name=285:9></a> Nevertheless we, as being ourselves in Christ, find in it a remarkable development of our relationships with God, of the intimacy of those relationships, and of the effect of that intimacy.<a name=285:10></a> Christ is the foundation on which our blessings are built.<a name=285:11></a> It is as being in Him that we enjoy them.<a name=285:12></a> We thus become the actual and present object of the favour of God the Father, even as Christ Himself is its object.<a name=285:13></a> The Father has given us to Him; Christ has died for us, has redeemed, washed, and quickened us, and presents us, according to the efficacy of His work, and according to the acceptance of His Person, before God His Father.<a name=285:14></a> The secret of all the assembly's blessing is, that it is blessed with Jesus Himself; and thus -- like Him, viewed as a man -- is accepted before God; for the assembly is His body, and enjoys in Him and by Him all that His Father has bestowed on Him.<a name=285:15></a> Individually the Christian is loved as Christ on earth was loved; he will hereafter share in the glory of Christ before the eyes of the world, as a proof that he was so loved, in connection with the name of Father, which God maintains in regard to this (see <a href="../bible/John.htm#17:23">John  17:23</a> - 26).<a name=285:16></a> Hence in general we have in this epistle the believer in Christ, not Christ in the believer, though that of course be true.<a name=285:17></a> It leads up to the privileges of the believer and of the assembly, more than to the fulness of Christ Himself, and we find more the contrast of this new position with what we were as of the world than development

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But before attempting to set forth in detail the apostle's thought, let us remark that he begins here entirely with God, His thoughts and His counsels, not with what man is.<a name=286:9></a> We may lay hold of the truth, so to speak, by one or the other of two ends -- by that of the sinner's condition in connection with man's responsibility, or by that of the thoughts and eternal counsels of God in view of His own glory.<a name=286:10></a> The latter is that side of the truth on which the Spirit here makes us look.<a name=286:11></a> Even redemption, all glorious as it is in itself, is consigned to the second place, as the means by which we enjoy the effect of God's counsels.<a name=286:12></a>

		In verse 13 he extends the same blessing to the Gentiles, which gives occasion for another precious truth with regard to us -- a thing that is true of every believer, but that had special force with regard to those from among the Gentles.<a name=294:4></a> God had put His seal on them by the gift of the Holy Ghost.<a name=294:5></a> They were not, according to the flesh, heirs of the promises; but, when they believed, God sealed them with the Holy Spirit of promise, who is the earnest of the inheritance, both of the one and the other, Jews and Gentiles, until the possession acquired by Christ should be delivered to Him, until He should in fact take possession of it by His power -- a power which will allow no adversary to subsist.<a name=294:6></a> Remark here, that the subject is not being born again, but a seal put on believers, a demonstration and earnest of their future full participation in the heritage that belongs to Christ -- an inheritance to which He has a right through redemption, whereby He has purchased all things to Himself, but which He will only appropriate by His power when He shall have gathered together all the co-heirs to enjoy it with Him.<a name=294:7></a>

		From verse 15 to the end, we have the apostle's prayer for the saints, flowing from this revelation -- a prayer founded on the way in which the children of God have been brought into their blessings in Christ, and leading thus to the whole truth respecting the union of Christ and the assembly, and the place which Christ takes in the universe that He created as Son, and which He reassumes as man; and on the power displayed in placing

		us, as well as Christ Himself, at the height of this position which God has given us in His counsels.<a name=295:1></a> This prayer is founded on the title of "God of our Lord Jesus Christ"; that of chapter 3 on the title of "Father of our Lord Jesus Christ".<a name=295:2></a> There it is more communion than counsels.<a name=295:3></a> God is called the Father of glory here, as being its source and author.<a name=295:4></a> But not only is it said, "The God of our Lord Jesus Christ", but we shall see also that Christ is viewed as man.<a name=295:5></a> God has wrought in Christ (verse 20), He has raised Him from among the dead -- has made Him sit at His right hand.<a name=295:6></a> In a word, all that happened to Christ is considered as the effect of the power of God who has accomplished it.<a name=295:7></a> Christ could say, "Destroy this temple, and I will raise it up again in three days", for He was God; but here He is viewed as man; it is God who raises Him up again.<a name=295:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two parts in this prayer: first, that they may understand what the calling and the inheritance of God are; and secondly, what the power is that puts them in possession of that which this calling confers upon them -- the same power which sets Christ at the right hand of God, having raised Him from among the dead.<a name=295:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, the understanding of the things given us.<a name=295:10></a> We find, it appears to me, the two things which, in the previous part of the chapter, we have seen to be the saint's portion -- the hope of the calling of God, and the glory of His inheritance in the saints.<a name=295:11></a> The first is connected with verses 3 - 5, that is, our calling; the second, with verse 11, that is, the inheritance.<a name=295:12></a> In the former we have found grace (that is, God acting towards us because He is love); in the latter, the glory -- man manifested as enjoying in His Person and inheritance the fruits of the power and the counsels of God.<a name=295:13></a> God calls us to be before Him, holy and unblamable in love, and at the same time to be His sons.<a name=295:14></a> The glory of His inheritance is ours.<a name=295:15></a> Take notice that the apostle does not say "our calling", although we are the called.<a name=295:16></a> He characterises this calling by connecting it with Him who calls in order that we may understand it according to its excellence, according to its true character.<a name=295:17></a> The calling is according to God Himself.<a name=295:18></a> All the blessedness and character of this calling are according to the fulness of His grace -- are worthy of Himself.<a name=295:19></a> It is this which we hope for.<a name=295:20></a> It is also His inheritance, as the land of Canaan was His, as He had said in the law, and which nevertheless He inherited in Israel.<a name=295:21></a>

		Even so the inheritance of the whole universe, when it shall be filled with glory, belongs to Him, but He inherits it in the saints.<a name=296:1></a> It is the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints.<a name=296:2></a> He will fill all things with His glory, and it is in the saints that He will inherit them.<a name=296:3></a> These are the two parts of the first thing to which the eyes of the saints were to be opened.<a name=296:4></a> By the calling of God we are called to enjoy the blessedness of His presence, near to Himself, to enjoy that which is above us.<a name=296:5></a> The inheritance of God applies to that which is below us, to created things, which are all made subject to Christ, with whom and in whom we enjoy the light of the presence of God near to Him.<a name=296:6></a> The apostle's desire is, that the Ephesians may understand these two things.<a name=296:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The second thing that the apostle asks for them is, that they may know the power already manifested, which had already wrought to give them part in this blessed and glorious position.<a name=296:8></a> For, even as they were introduced by the sovereign grace of God into the position of Christ before God His Father; so also the work which has been wrought in Christ, and the display of the power of God, which took place in raising Him from the grave to the right hand of God the Father above every name that is named, are the expression and the model of the action of the same power which works in us who believe, which has raised us from our state of death in sin to have part in the glory of this same Christ.<a name=296:9></a> This power is the basis of the assembly's position in her union with Him and of the development of the mystery according to the purposes of God.<a name=296:10></a> In person Christ raised up from among the dead is set at the right hand of God, far above all power and authority, and above every name that is named among the hierarchies by which God administers the government of the world that now is, or among those of the world to come.<a name=296:11></a> And this superiority exists, not only with regard to His divinity, the glory of which changes not, but with regard to the place given Him as man; for we speak here -- as we have seen -- of the God of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=296:12></a> It is He who has raised Him from the dead, and who has given Him glory and a place above all; a place of which no doubt He was personally worthy, but which He receives, and ought to receive, as man from the hand of God, who has established Him as Head over all things, uniting the assembly to Him as His body, and raising up the members from their death in sins by the same power as that which raised up and exalted the Head -- quickening them

		Observe too here, that the apostle does not now ask that God should act by a power, as it is often expressed, which works for us, but by a power that works in us.<a name=310:1></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#46:310">footnote</a></i>) He is able to do above all that we can ask or think according to His power that works in us.<a name=310:2></a> What a portion for us!<a name=310:3></a> What a place is this which is given us in Christ!<a name=310:4></a> But he returns thus to the thesis proposed at the end of chapter 2, God dwelling in the assembly by the Spirit, and Christians, whether Jews or Gentiles, united in one.<a name=310:5></a> He desires that the Ephesian Christians (and all of us) should walk worthy of this vocation.<a name=310:6></a> Their vocation was to be one, the body of Christ; but this body in fact manifested on earth in its true unity by the presence of the Holy Ghost.<a name=310:7></a> We have seen (chapter 1) the Christian brought into the presence of God Himself; but the fact that these Christians formed the body of Christ, and that they were the dwelling-place of God here below, the house of God on the earth -- in a word, their whole position -- is comprised in the expression, "their vocation".<a name=310:8></a> Chapter 1, note, gives the saints before God; the prayer of chapter 3, Christ in them.<a name=310:9></a>

		Chapter 4.<a name=310:10></a> Now the apostle was in prison for the testimony which he had borne to this truth, for having maintained and preached the privileges that God had granted to the Gentiles, and in particular that of forming by faith, together with the believing Jews, one body united to Christ.<a name=310:11></a> In his exhortation he makes use of this fact as a touching motive.<a name=310:12></a> Now the first thing that he looked for on the part of his beloved children in the faith, as befitting this unity and as a means of maintaining it in practice, was the spirit of humility and meekness, forbearance with one another in love.<a name=310:13></a> This is the individual state which he desired to be realised among the Ephesians.<a name=310:14></a> It is the true fruit of nearness to God, and of the possession of privileges; if they are enjoyed in His presence.<a name=310:15></a>

		At the end of chapter 2 the apostle had unfolded the result of the work of Christ in uniting the Jew and the Gentile, in making peace, and in thus forming the dwelling-place of God on the earth; Jew and Gentile having access to God by one Spirit through the mediation of Christ, both being reconciled

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The faithful were to seek -- in the dispositions mentioned above -- to maintain this unity of the Spirit by the bond of peace.<a name=311:5></a> There are three things in this exhortation: first, to walk worthy of their calling; second, the spirit in which they were to do so; third, diligence in maintaining the unity of the Spirit by the bond of peace.<a name=311:6></a> It is important to observe, that this unity of the Spirit is not similarity of sentiment, but the oneness of the members of the body of Christ established by the Holy Ghost, maintained practically by a walk according to the Spirit of grace.<a name=311:7></a> It is evident that the diligence required for the maintenance of the unity of the Spirit relates to the earth and to the manifestation of this unity on the earth.<a name=311:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle now founds his exhortation on the different points of view under which this unity may be considered -- in connection with the Holy Ghost, with the Lord, and with God.<a name=311:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is one body and one Spirit; not merely an effect produced in the heart of individuals, in order that they might mutually understand each other, but one body.<a name=311:10></a> The hope was one, of which this Spirit was the source and the power.<a name=311:11></a> This is the essential, real, and abiding unity.<a name=311:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There is also one Lord.<a name=311:13></a> With Him was connected "one faith" and "one baptism".<a name=311:14></a> This is the public profession and recognition of Christ as Lord.<a name=311:15></a> Compare the address in 1 Corinthians.<a name=311:16></a>

		We may remark, that the three spheres of unity presented in these three verses have not the same extent.<a name=312:3></a> The circle of unity enlarges each time.<a name=312:4></a> With the Spirit we find linked the unity of the body, the essential and real unity produced by the power of the Spirit uniting to Christ all His members: with the Lord, that of faith and of baptism.<a name=312:5></a> Here each individual has the same faith, the same baptism: it is the outward profession, true and real perhaps, but a profession, in reference to Him who has rights over those that call themselves by His name.<a name=312:6></a> With regard to the third character of unity, it relates to claims that extend to all things, although to the believer it is a closer bond, because He who has a right over all things dwells in believers.<a name=312:7></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#46:312">footnote</a></i>)

	<div class="paragraph">
		Observe here, that it is not only a unity of sentiment, of desire, and of heart.<a name=312:8></a> That unity is pressed upon them; but it is in order to maintain the realisation, and the manifestation here below, of a unity that belongs to the existence and to the eternal position of the assembly in Christ.<a name=312:9></a> There is one Spirit, but there is one body.<a name=312:10></a> The union of hearts in the bond of peace, which the apostle desires, is for the public maintenance

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, on the other hand, the fact that Christ was exalted to be in heaven the Head over all things, brought in a difference which appertained to this supremacy of Christ -- a supremacy exercised with divine sovereignty and wisdom.<a name=313:4></a> "Unto every one of us is given grace [gift] according to the measure of the gift of Christ" (that is to say, as Christ sees fit to bestow).<a name=313:5></a> With regard to our position of joy and blessing in Christ, we are one.<a name=313:6></a> With regard to our service, we have each an individual place according to His divine wisdom, and according to His sovereign rights in the work.<a name=313:7></a> The foundation of this title, whatever may be the divine power that is exercised in it, is this: man was under the power of Satan -- miserable condition, the fruit of his sin, a condition to which his self-will had reduced him, but in which (according to the judgment of God who had pronounced on him the sentence of death) he was a slave in body and mind to the enemy who had the power of death -- with reservation of the sovereign rights and sovereign grace of God (see chapter 2: 2).<a name=313:8></a> Now Christ has made Himself man, and began by going as man, led by the Spirit, to meet Satan.<a name=313:9></a> He overcame him.<a name=313:10></a> As to His personal power, He was able to drive him out everywhere, and to deliver man.<a name=313:11></a> But man would not have God with him; nor was it possible for men, in their sinful condition, to be united to Christ without redemption.<a name=313:12></a> The Lord however, carrying on His perfect work of love, suffered death, and overcame Satan in that his last stronghold, which God's righteous judgment maintained in force against sinful man -- a judgment which Christ therefore underwent, accomplishing a redemption that was complete, final, and eternal in its value; so that neither Satan, the prince of death and accuser of the children of God on earth, nor even the judgment of God, had anything more to say to the redeemed.<a name=313:13></a>

		The kingdom of Satan was taken from him; the just judgment of God was undergone and completely satisfied.<a name=314:1></a> All judgment is committed to the Son, and power over all men, because He is the Son of man.<a name=314:2></a> These two results are not yet manifested, although the Lord possesses all power in heaven and in earth.<a name=314:3></a> The thing here spoken of is another result which is accomplished meanwhile.<a name=314:4></a> The victory is complete.<a name=314:5></a> He has led the adversary captive.<a name=314:6></a> In ascending to heaven He has placed victorious man above all things, and has led captive all the power that previously had dominion over man.<a name=314:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now before manifesting in person the power He had gained as man by binding Satan, before displaying it in the blessing of man on earth, He exhibits it in the assembly, His body, by imparting, as He had promised, to men delivered from the enemy's dominion gifts which are the proof of that power.<a name=314:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 1 had laid open to us the thoughts of God; chapter 2 the fulfilment, in power, of His thoughts with regard to the redeemed -- Jews or Gentiles, all dead in their sins -- to form them into the assembly.<a name=314:9></a> Chapter 3 is the especial development of the mystery in that which concerned the Gentiles in Paul's administration of it on earth.<a name=314:10></a> Here (chapter 4) the assembly is presented in its unity as a body, and in the varied functions of its members; that is to say, the positive effect of those counsels in the assembly here below.<a name=314:11></a> But this is founded on the exaltation of Christ, who, the conqueror of the enemy, has ascended to heaven as man.<a name=314:12></a>
	</div>

		Thus exalted, He has received gifts in man, that is, in His human character (compare <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:33">Acts  2:33</a>).<a name=314:13></a> It is thus "in man", that it is expressed in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#68">Psalm  68</a>, from whence the quotation is taken.<a name=314:14></a> Here, having received these gifts as the Head of the body, Christ is the channel of their communication to others.<a name=314:15></a> They are gifts for men.<a name=314:16></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But let us pause here for a moment, to contemplate the import of that which we have been considering.<a name=315:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What a complete and glorious work is that which the Lord has accomplished for us, and of which the communication of these gifts is the precious testimony!<a name=315:4></a> When we were the slaves of Satan and consequently of death, as well as the slaves of sin, we have seen that He was pleased to undergo for the glory of God that which hung over us.<a name=315:5></a> He went down into death of which Satan had the power.<a name=315:6></a> And so complete was the victory of man in Him, so entire our deliverance, that (exalted Himself as man to the right hand of God's throne -- He who had been under death) He has rescued us from the enemy's yoke, and uses the privilege which His position and His glory give Him to make those who were captives before, the vessels of His power for the deliverance of others also.<a name=315:7></a> He gives us the right, as under His jurisdiction, of acting in His holy war, moved by the same principles of love as Himself.<a name=315:8></a> Such is our deliverance that we are the instruments of His power against the enemy -- His fellow-labourers in love through His power.<a name=315:9></a> Hence the connection between practical godliness, the complete subjugation of the flesh, and the capacity to serve Christ as instruments in the hand of the Holy Ghost, and the vessels of His power.<a name=315:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the Lord's ascension has immense significancy in connection with His Person and work.<a name=315:11></a> He ascended indeed as man, but He first descended as man even into the darkness of the grave and of death; and from thence -- victorious over the power of the enemy who had the power of death, and having blotted out the sins of His redeemed ones, and accomplished the glory of God in obedience -- He takes His place as man above the heavens in order that He may fill all things; not only as being God, but according to the glory and the power of a position in which He was placed by the accomplishment of the work of redemption -- a work which led Him into the depths of the power of the enemy, and placed Him on the throne of God -- a position that He holds, not only by the title of Creator, which was already His, but by that of Redeemer, which shelters from evil all that is found within the sphere of the mighty efficacy of His
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		work -- a sphere filled with blessing, with grace, and with Himself.<a name=316:1></a> Glorious truth, which belongs at the same time to the union of the divine and human natures in the Person of Christ, and to the work of redemption accomplished by suffering on the cross!<a name=316:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Love brought Him down from the throne of God, and, being found as a man,(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#46:316">footnote</a></i>) through the same grace, into the darkness of death.<a name=316:3></a> Having died, bearing our sins, He has gone up again to that throne as man, filling all things.<a name=316:4></a> He went below the creature into death, and is gone above it.<a name=316:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But while filling all things by virtue of His glorious Person, and in connection with the work which He accomplished, He is also in immediate relation with that which in the counsels of God is closely united to Him who thus fills all things, with that which has been especially the object of His work of redemption.<a name=316:6></a> It is His body, His assembly, united to Him by the bond of the Holy Ghost to complete this mystical man, to be the bride of this second Man, who fills all in all -- a body which, as manifested here below, is set in the midst of a creation that is not yet delivered, and in the presence of enemies that are in the heavenly places, until Christ shall exercise, on the part of God His Father, the power that has been committed to Him as man.<a name=316:7></a> When Christ shall thus exercise His power, He will take vengeance on those who have defiled His creation by seducing man, who had been its head down here and the image of Him who was to be its Head everywhere.<a name=316:8></a> He will also deliver creation from its subjection to evil.<a name=316:9></a> Meanwhile, personally exalted as the glorious man, and seated at God's right hand until God shall make His enemies His footstool, He communicates the gifts necessary for the gathering together of those who are to be the companions of His glory, who are the members of His body, and who shall be manifested with Him when His glory shines forth in the midst of this world of darkness.<a name=316:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle shews us here an assembly already delivered, and exercising the power of the Spirit; which on the one side delivers souls, and on the other builds them up in Christ, that they may grow up to the measure of their Head in spite of all the power of Satan which still subsists.<a name=316:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But an important truth is connected with this fact.<a name=316:12></a> This
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=317>[Page 317]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		spiritual power is not exercised in a manner simply divine.<a name=317:1></a> It is Christ ascended (He however who had previously descended into the lower parts of the earth) who, as man, has received these gifts of power.<a name=317:2></a> It is thus that <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#68">Psalm  68</a>speaks as well as <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:33">Acts  2:33</a>.<a name=317:3></a> The latter passage speaks also of the gifts bestowed on His members.<a name=317:4></a> In our chapter it is only in the latter way that they are mentioned.<a name=317:5></a> He has given gifts unto men.<a name=317:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would also remark, that these gifts are not here presented as gifts bestowed by the Holy Ghost come down to earth, and distributing to every one according to His will: nor are those gifts spoken of which are tokens of spiritual power suited to act as signs upon those that are outside: but they are ministrations for gathering together and for edification established by Christ as Head of the body by means of gifts with which He endows persons as His choice.<a name=317:7></a> Ascended on high, and having taken His place as man at the right hand of God, and filling all things, whatever may be the extent of His glory, Christ has first for His object to fulfil the ways of God in love in gathering souls, and in particular towards the saints and the assembly; to establish the manifestation of the divine nature, and to communicate to the assembly the riches of that grace which the ways of God display, and of which the divine nature is the source.<a name=317:8></a> It is in the assembly that the nature of God, the counsels of grace, and the efficacious work of Christ are concentrated in their object; and these gifts are the means of ministering, in the communication of these, in blessing to man.<a name=317:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers: apostles and prophets laying, or rather being laid, as the foundations of the heavenly building, and acting as coming directly from the Lord in an extraordinary manner; the two other classes (the last being sub-divided into two gifts, connected in their nature) belonging to ordinary ministry in all ages.<a name=317:10></a> It is important to remark also, that the apostle sees nothing existing before the exaltation of Christ save man the child of wrath, the power of Satan, the power which raised us up (dead in sins as we were) with Christ, and the efficacy of the cross, which had reconciled us to God, and abolished the distinction between Jew and Gentile in the assembly, to unite them in one body before God -- the cross in which Christ drank the cup and bore the curse, so that wrath has passed away for the believer, and in which a God of love, a Saviour God, is fully manifested.<a name=317:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=318>[Page 318]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the existence of the apostles dates here only from the gifts that followed the exaltation of Jesus.<a name=318:1></a> The twelve as sent out by Jesus on earth have no place in the instruction of this epistle, which treats of the body of Christ, of the unity and the members of this body; and the body could not exist before the Head existed and had taken His place as such.<a name=318:2></a> Thus also we have seen that, when the apostle speaks of the apostles and prophets, the latter are to him those exclusively of the New Testament, and those who have been made such by Christ after His ascension.<a name=318:3></a> It is the new heavenly man who, being the exalted Head in heaven, forms His body on the earth.<a name=318:4></a> He does it for heaven, putting the individuals who compose it spiritually and intelligently in connection with the Head by the power of the Holy Ghost acting in this body on the earth; the gifts, of which the apostle here speaks, being the channels by which His graces are communicated according to the bonds which the Holy Ghost forms with the Head.<a name=318:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The proper and immediate effect is the perfecting of individuals according to the grace that dwells in the Head.<a name=318:6></a> The shape which this divine action takes, further, is the work of the ministry, and the formation of the body of Christ, until all the members are grown up into the measure of the stature of Christ their Head.<a name=318:7></a> Christ has been revealed in all His fulness: it is according to this revelation that the members of the body are to be formed in the likeness of Christ, known as filling all things, and as the Head of His body, the revelation of the perfect love of God, of the excellency of man before Him according to His counsels, of man the vessel of all His grace, all His power, and all His gifts.<a name=318:8></a> Thus the assembly, and each one of the members of Christ, should be filled with the thoughts and the riches of a well-known Christ, instead of being tossed to and fro by all sort of doctrines brought forward by the enemy to deceive souls.<a name=318:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Christian was to grow up according to all that was revealed in Christ, and to be ever increasing in likeness to his Head; using love and truth for his own soul -- the two things of which Christ is the perfect expression.<a name=318:10></a> Truth displays the real relation of all things with each other in connection with the centre of all things, which is God revealed now in Christ.<a name=318:11></a> Love is that which God is in the midst of all this.<a name=318:12></a> Now Christ, as the light, put everything precisely in its place -- man, Satan, sin, righteousness, holiness, all things, and that in every detail, and in connection with God.<a name=318:13></a> And Christ was love, the expression

	<div class="page-number">

	<div class="paragraph">
		of the love of God in the midst of all this.<a name=319:1></a> And this is our pattern; and our pattern as having overcome, and, as having ascended into heaven, our Head, to which we are united as the members of His body.<a name=319:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There flows from this Head, by means of its members, the grace needed to accomplish the work of assimilation to Himself.<a name=319:3></a> His body, compacted together, increases by the working of His grace in each member, and edifies itself in love.<a name=319:4></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#46:319">footnote</a></i>) This is the position of the assembly according to God, until all the members of the body attain to the stature of Christ.<a name=319:5></a> The manifestation alas!<a name=319:6></a> of this unity is marred; but the grace, and the operation of the grace of its Head to nourish and cause its members to grow, is never impaired, any more than the love in the Lord's heart from which this grace springs.<a name=319:7></a> We do not glorify Him, we have not the joy of being ministers of joy to each other as we might be; but the Head does not cease to work for the good of His body.<a name=319:8></a> The wolf indeed comes and scatters the sheep, but he cannot pluck them out of the Shepherd's hands.<a name=319:9></a> His faithfulness is glorified in our unfaithfulness without excusing it.<a name=319:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With this precious object of the ministration of grace (namely, for the growth of each member individually unto the measure of the stature of the Head Himself), with the ministration of each member in its place to the edifying itself in love, ends this development of the counsels of God in the union of Christ and the assembly, in its double character of the body of Christ in heaven, and the habitation of the Holy Ghost on earth -- truths which cannot be separated, but each of which has its distinctive importance, and which reconcile the certain immutable operations of grace in the Head with the failures of the assembly responsible on the earth.<a name=319:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Exhortations to a walk befitting such a position follow, in order that the glory of God in us and by us, and His grace towards us, may be identified in our full blessing.<a name=319:12></a> We will notice the great principles of these exhortations.<a name=319:13></a>

		Moreover, let us remark here, and it is an important feature in this picture of the fruits of grace and of the new man, that when the grace and love, which come down from God, act in man, they always go up again to God in devotedness.<a name=324:14></a> Walk, he says, in love, even as Christ loved us and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour.<a name=324:15></a>

		The apostle then speaks plainly as to sin, in order that no one may deceive himself; nor be occupied with deep truths, using them intellectually, to the neglect of ordinary morality -- one of the signs of heresy, properly so called.<a name=325:4></a> He has connected the profoundest doctrines in his teaching with daily practice.<a name=325:5></a> If Christ be glorified, the Head of the assembly, He is the model of the new man, the last Adam; the assembly being one with Him on high, and the habitation of God on earth by the Spirit, with whom every Christian is sealed.<a name=325:6></a> Every Christian, if indeed he has learned the truth as it is in Jesus, has learned that it consists in having put off the old man, and having put on the new man, created after God in righteousness and holiness (of which Christ is the model, according to the counsels of God in glory); and he is to grow up unto the measure of the stature of Christ, who is the Head, and not grieve the Holy Spirit wherewith he is sealed.<a name=325:7></a> The fullest revelation of grace does not weaken the immutable truth that God had a character proper to Himself; it unfolds that character to us by means of the most precious revelations of the gospel, and of the closest relationships with God, which were formed by these revelations: but this character could not alter, nor could the kingdom of God allow of, any characters contrary to it.<a name=325:8></a> The wrath of God therefore against evil, and against those who commit it, is plainly set forth.<a name=325:9></a>

		But, in speaking of motives, the apostle returns to the great subjects that pre-occupied him, and he returns to them, not only that we should put on the character set forth by that of which he speaks, but that we should realise all its extent, that we should experience all its force.<a name=326:1></a> He had told us that the truth in Christ was the having put on the new man, in contrast with the old man, and that we are not to grieve the Holy Spirit.<a name=326:2></a> Now he exhorts those that sleep to awake, and Christ should be their light.<a name=326:3></a> Light makes all things manifest; but he who sleeps, although not dead, does not profit by it.<a name=326:4></a> For hearing, seeing, and all mental reception and communication, he is in the state of a dead man.<a name=326:5></a> Alas, how apt this sleep is to overtake us!<a name=326:6></a> But in awaking, it was not that they should see the light dimly, but Christ Himself should be the light of the soul; they should have all the full revelation of that which is well-pleasing to God, that which He loves; they should have divine wisdom in Christ; they should be able to profit by opportunities, should find them, being thus enlightened, in the difficulties of a world governed by the enemy, and should act according to spiritual understanding in every case that presented itself.<a name=326:7></a> Further, if they were not to lose their senses through means of excitement used in the world, they were to be filled with the Spirit, that is, that He should take such possession of our affections, our thoughts, our understanding, that He should be their only source according to His proper and mighty energy to the exclusion of all else.<a name=326:8></a> Thus, full of joy, we should praise, we should sing for joy; and we should give thanks for all that might happen, because a God of love is the true source of all.<a name=326:9></a> We should be full of joy in the spiritual realisation of the objects of faith, and the heart continuing to be filled with the Spirit and sustained by this grace, the experience of the hand of God in everything here below will give rise only to thanksgiving.<a name=326:10></a> It comes from His hand whom we trust and whose love we know.<a name=326:11></a> But giving thanks in all things is a test of the state of the soul; because the consciousness that all things are from God's hand, full trust in His love, and deadness as to any will of our own, must exist in order to give thanks in everything -- a single eye which delights in His will.<a name=326:12></a>

		We cannot fail to notice the connection between the cleansing and the glory, that is, that the cleansing is according to the glory and by it; and that the glory is the completeness of, and completely answers to, the cleansing.<a name=332:7></a> For the cleansing is by the word, which reveals the whole glory and mind of God.<a name=332:8></a> Presented in glory she has neither spot not wrinkle; she is holy and unblamable.<a name=332:9></a> This is a most important truth, and recurs elsewhere.<a name=332:10></a> Compare <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#3:18">2 Corinthians  3:18</a>, and <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3:11">Philippians  3:11</a> to the end.<a name=332:11></a> So in <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#3:13">1 Thessalonians  3:13</a>.<a name=332:12></a> What is complete in glory there, is wrought into the soul now by the Spirit operating with the word.<a name=332:13></a>

		The apostle, who did not lose sight of the thesis which gave rise to this digression that is so instructive to us, says that the husband ought to love his wife as his own body -- that it was loving himself.<a name=332:17></a> He was naturally led to this by the allusion to Genesis; but he immediately returns to the subject that occupies him.<a name=332:18></a> No one, he says, ever hated his own flesh; he nourishes and cherishes it, even as the Lord the assembly.<a name=332:19></a> This is the precious aspect, during time, of Christ's love, which the apostle here presents.<a name=332:20></a> Not only has Christ a heavenly aim, but His love performs the work which, so to speak, is natural to it.<a name=332:21></a> He tenderly cares for the assembly here below; He nourishes it, He cherishes it.<a name=332:22></a> The wants, the weaknesses, the difficulties, the anxieties of the assembly are only opportunities to Christ for the exercise of His love.<a name=332:23></a> The assembly needs to

		There remain yet certain relationships in life, with which the doctrine of the Spirit of God is connected: those of children and parents, of fathers and children, and of servants and master.<a name=333:17></a> It is interesting to see the children of believers introduced as objects of the Holy Spirit's care, and even slaves (for servants were such), raised by Christianity to a position which the circumstances of their social degradation could not affect.<a name=333:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All the children of Christians are viewed as subjects of the exhortations in the Lord, which belong to those who are within, who are no longer in this world, of which Satan is the prince.<a name=333:19></a> Sweet and precious comfort to the parent, that he may look upon them as having a right to this position, and a part in those tender cares which the Holy Ghost lavishes on all who are in the house of God!<a name=333:20></a> The apostle marks the importance which God attached, under the law, to this duty.<a name=333:21></a> It is the first command with which He linked a promise.<a name=333:22></a> Verse 3 is only the quotation of that which he alludes to in verse 2.<a name=333:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The exhortation to fathers is also remarkable -- that they should not provoke their children; that their hearts should be turned towards them; that they should not repel them, nor destroy that influence which is the strongest guard against the evil of the world.<a name=333:24></a> God forms the heart of children around this happy centre: the father should watch over this.<a name=333:25></a> But there is more.<a name=333:26></a> The christian father (for it is always those

		within to whom he speaks) ought to recognise the position in which, as we have seen, the children are placed, and to bring them up under the yoke of Christ in the discipline and admonition of the Lord.<a name=334:1></a> Christian position is to be the measure and the form of the influences which the father exercises, and of the education which he gives his children.<a name=334:2></a> He treats them as brought up for the Lord, and as the Lord would bring them up.<a name=334:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It will be remarked, that in the two relationships we are considering, as well as in that of wives with their husbands, it is on the side from which submission is due that the exhortations begin.<a name=334:4></a> This is the genius of Christianity in our evil world, in which man's will is the source of all the evil, expressing his departure from God to whom all submission is due.<a name=334:5></a> The principle of submission and of obedience is the healing principle of humanity: only God must be brought into it, in order that the will of man be not the guide after all.<a name=334:6></a> But the principle that governs the heart of man in good, is always and everywhere obedience.<a name=334:7></a> I may have to say that God must be obeyed rather than man; but to depart from obedience is to enter into sin.<a name=334:8></a> A man may have, as a father, to command and direct; but he does it ill if he do it not in obedience to God and to His word.<a name=334:9></a> This was the essence of the life of Christ: "I come to do thy will, O my God".<a name=334:10></a> Accordingly the apostle begins his exhortations with regard to relationships by giving the general precept: "Submit yourselves one to another".<a name=334:11></a> This renders order easy, even when the order of institutions and of authority may fail.<a name=334:12></a> Submission, moral obedience, can never in principle be wanting to the true Christian.<a name=334:13></a> It is the starting-point of his whole life.<a name=334:14></a> He is sanctified unto the obedience of Christ (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:2">1 Peter  1:2</a>).<a name=334:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the case which has led to these remarks, it is striking to see how this principle elevates the slave in his condition: he obeys by an inward divine principle, as though it were Christ Himself whom he obeyed.<a name=334:16></a> However wicked his master may be, he obeys as if he obeyed Christ Himself.<a name=334:17></a> Three times the apostle repeats this principle of obedience to Christ or the service of Christ, adding, "doing the will of God from the heart".<a name=334:18></a> What a difference this made in the poor slave's condition!<a name=334:19></a> Moreover, whether bond or free, each should receive his reward from the Lord.<a name=334:20></a> The master himself had the same Master in heaven, with whom there is no respect of persons.<a name=334:21></a> Still it is to masters that he says this, not to the slave; for

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is beautiful to see the way in which divine doctrine enters into the details of life, and throws the fragrance of its perfection into every duty and every relationship; how it acknowledges existing things, as far as they can be owned and directed by its principles, but exalts and enhances the value of everything according to the perfection of those principles; by touching not the relationships but the man's heart who walks in them; taking the moral side, and that of submission, in love and in the exercise of authority which the divine doctrine can regulate, bringing in the grace which governs the use of the authority of God.<a name=335:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But it is not only that there is a line of conduct to follow, a model to imitate, a Spirit with whom one may be filled, it is not only relationships between oneself and God, and those in which we stand here below; this is not all that must occupy the Christian.<a name=335:4></a> He has enemies to fight.<a name=335:5></a> The people of Israel under Joshua in the land of Canaan were indeed in the promised land, but they were in conflict there with enemies who were in it before them, although not according to the rights by which Israel possessed the land through the gift of God.<a name=335:6></a> God had set it apart for Israel (see <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#32:8">Deuteronomy  32:8</a>); Ham had taken possession of it.<a name=335:7></a>

		Satan has no hold on a heart thus kept in the truth, as revealed by God; there is nothing in its desires that answers to the suggestions of Satan.<a name=339:2></a> Take Jesus as an example.<a name=339:3></a> His safeguard was not in judging all that Satan said.<a name=339:4></a> In the wilderness at the beginning of His public service, except in the last temptation, it was in the perfect application of the word for Himself, for that which concerned His own conduct, to the circumstances around Him.<a name=339:5></a> The truth governed His heart, so that it only moved according to that truth in the circumstance that presented itself "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God".<a name=339:6></a> No word has come forth -- He does nothing.<a name=339:7></a> There was no motive for acting.<a name=339:8></a> It would have been to act of His own accord, of His own will.<a name=339:9></a> That truth kept His heart in connection with God in the circumstance that met Him.<a name=339:10></a> When the circumstance arose, His heart was already in intercourse with God, so that it had no other impulse than that which the word of truth suggested.<a name=339:11></a> His conduct was purely negative, but it flowed from the light which truth threw upon the circumstance, because His heart was under the absolute government of the truth.<a name=339:12></a> The suggestion of Satan would have brought Him out of this position.<a name=339:13></a> That was enough.<a name=339:14></a> He will have nothing to do with it.<a name=339:15></a> He does not yet drive away Satan: it was only a matter of conduct, not of flagrant opposition to the glory of God.<a name=339:16></a> In the latter case He drives him away; in the former He acts according to God without concerning Himself with anything farther.<a name=339:17></a> Satan's device totally failed of its effect.<a name=339:18></a> It simply produced nothing.<a name=339:19></a> It is absolutely powerless against the truth, because it is not the truth; and the hearth has truth for its rule.<a name=339:20></a> Wiles are not the truth: this is quite enough to prevent our being caught by them, that is, if the heart be thus governed.<a name=339:21></a>

		PHILIPPIANS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the epistle to the Philippians we find much more of christian experience, and the development of the exercise of the heart, than in the generality of the epistles.<a name=344:1></a> It is in fact proper christian experience.<a name=344:2></a> Doctrine and practice are found in them all, but, with the exception of the second to Timothy which is of another nature, there is none that contains like this, the expression of the Christian's experience in this toilsome life, and the resources which are open to him in passing through it, and the motives which ought to govern him.<a name=344:3></a> We may even say that this epistle gives us the experience of christian life in its highest and most perfect expression -- say, rather, its normal condition under the power of the Spirit of God.<a name=344:4></a> God has condescended to furnish us with this beautiful picture of it, as well as with the truths that enlighten us, and the rules that direct our walk.<a name=344:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The occasion for it was quite natural.<a name=344:6></a> Paul was in prison, and the Philippians (who were very dear to him, and who, at the commencement of his labours, had testified their affection for him by similar gifts) had just sent assistance to the apostle by the hand of Epaphroditus at a moment when, as it appears, he had been for some time in need.<a name=344:7></a> A prison, need, the consciousness that the assembly of God was deprived of his watchful care, this expression on the part of the Philippians of the love that thought of him in his necessities, although at a distance -- what could be more adapted to open the apostle's heart, and lead to his expressing the confidence in God that animated him, as well as what he felt with regard to the assembly, unsupported now by his apostolic care, and having to trust God Himself without any intermediate help?<a name=344:8></a> And it was most natural that he should pour out his feelings into the bosom of these beloved Philippians, who had just given him this proof of their affection.<a name=344:9></a> The apostle therefore speaks more than once of the Philippians' fellowship with the gospel: that is to say, they took part in the labours, the trials, the necessities which the preaching of the gospel occasioned to those who devoted themselves to it.<a name=344:10></a> Their hearts united them to it -- like those of whom the Lord speaks who received a prophet in the name of a prophet.<a name=344:11></a>

		him in his labours in Macedonia, his true son in the faith and in the work, address themselves to the saints and to those who bore office in this particular assembly.<a name=345:1></a> This is not an epistle which soars to the height of God's counsels, like that to the Ephesians, or which regulates the godly order which becomes Christians everywhere, like the two to the Corinthians; nor is it one which lays the foundation for the relationship of a soul with God, like that to the Romans.<a name=345:2></a> Neither was it destined to guard Christians against the errors that were creeping in among them, like some of the others which were written by our apostle.<a name=345:3></a> It takes the ground of the precious inner life, of the common affection of Christians towards each other, but of that affection as experienced in the heart of Paul, animated and directed by the Holy Ghost.<a name=345:4></a> Hence also we find the ordinary relationships which existed within an assembly: there are bishops and deacons, and it was the more important to remember them, since the immediate care of the apostle was no longer possible.<a name=345:5></a> The absence of this immediate care forms the basis of the apostle's instructions here, and gives its peculiar importance to the epistle.<a name=345:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The affection of the Philippians, which expressed itself by sending help to the apostle, reminded him of the spirit they had always shewn; they had cordially associated themselves with the labours and trials of the gospel.<a name=345:7></a> And this thought leads the apostle higher, to that which governs the current of thought (most precious to us) in the epistle.<a name=345:8></a> Who had wrought in the Philippians this spirit of love and of devotedness to the interests of the gospel?<a name=345:9></a> Truly it was the God of the glad tidings and of love; and this was a security that He who had begun the good work would fulfil it unto the day of Christ.<a name=345:10></a> Sweet thought!<a name=345:11></a> -- now that we have no longer the apostle, that we have no longer bishops and deacons, as the Philippians had in those days.<a name=345:12></a> God cannot be taken from us; the true and living source of all blessing remains to us, unchangeable, and above the infirmities, and even the faults, which deprive Christians of all intermediate resources.<a name=345:13></a> The apostle had seen God acting in the Philippians.<a name=345:14></a> The fruits bore witness of the source.<a name=345:15></a> Hence he counted on the perpetuity of the blessing they were to enjoy.<a name=345:16></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#46:345">footnote</a></i>) But there must be faith in order to draw these conclusions.<a name=345:17></a> Christian love is clear-sighted and full of trust with regard to

		To return to the principle -- it is the same thing with the assembly of God.<a name=346:2></a> It may indeed lose much, as to outward means, and as to those manifestations of the presence of God, which are connected with man's responsibility; but the essential grace of God cannot be lost.<a name=346:3></a> Faith can always count upon it.<a name=346:4></a> It was the fruits of grace which gave the apostle this confidence, as in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#6:9">Hebrews  6:9</a>, 10; <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#1:3">1 Thessalonians  1:3</a>, 4.<a name=346:5></a> He counted indeed, in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:8">1 Corinthians  1:8</a>, and in Galatians, on the faithfulness of Christ in spite of many painful things.<a name=346:6></a> The faithfulness of the Lord encouraged him with regard to Christians, whose condition in other respects was the cause of great anxiety.<a name=346:7></a> But here -- surely a much happier case -- the walk itself of the Christian led him to the source of confidence about them.<a name=346:8></a> He remembered with affection and tenderness the way in which they had always acted towards him, and he turned it into a desire for them that the God who had wrought it would produce for their own blessing the perfect and abundant fruits of that love.<a name=346:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He opens his own heart also to them.<a name=346:10></a> They took part, by the same grace acting in them, in the work of God's grace in him, and that with an affection that identified itself with him and his work; and his heart turned to them with an abundant return of affection and desire.<a name=346:11></a> God, who created these feelings, and to whom he presented all that passed in his heart, this same God who acted in the Philippians, was a witness between them (now that Paul could give no other by his labour among them) of his earnest desire for them all.<a name=346:12></a> He felt their love, but he desired moreover, that this love should be not only cordial and active, but that it should be guided also by wisdom and understanding from God, by a godly discernment of good and evil, wrought by the power of His Spirit; so that, while acting in love, they should also walk according to that wisdom, and should understand that which, in this world of darkness, was truly according to divine light and perfection, so that they should be without reproach until the day of Christ.<a name=346:13></a> How different from the cold avoidance of positive sin with which many Christians content themselves!<a name=346:14></a> The earnest desire of every excellence and likeness to Christ which divine light can shew them is that which marks the life of Christ in us.<a name=346:15></a>

		with them; and He would fulfil the work unto the end.<a name=347:1></a> But the apostle desired that they should walk throughout the whole of the way according to the light that God had given, so that when they came to the end there should be nothing with which they could be reproached: but that, on the contrary, set free from all that might weaken or lead them astray, they should abound in the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God.<a name=347:2></a> A fine practical picture of the Christian's normal condition in his daily work towards the end; for, in the Philippians, we are always on the way towards our heavenly rest in which redemption has set us.<a name=347:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such is the introduction to this epistle.<a name=347:4></a> After this expression of the wishes of his heart for them, reckoning on their affection, he speaks of his bonds, which they had remembered; but he does so in connection with Christ and the gospel, which he had most of all at heart.<a name=347:5></a> But, before I go beyond the introduction into the matter of the epistle, I would notice the thoughts which lie at the foundation of the sentiments expressed in it.<a name=347:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are three great elements which stamp their character on it.<a name=347:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Firstly, it speaks of the Christian's pilgrimage in the wilderness; salvation is viewed as a result to be obtained at the end of the journey.<a name=347:8></a> Redemption accomplished by Christ is indeed established as the foundation of this pilgrimage (as was the case with Israel at their entrance into the wilderness), but the being presented risen and in glory before God, when victorious over every difficulty, is the subject in this epistle, and is that which is here called salvation.<a name=347:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the second place, the position is characterised by the apostle's absence, the assembly having therefore itself to maintain the conflict.<a name=347:10></a> It had to overcome, instead of enjoying the victory gained over the enemy's power by the apostle when he was with them and could make himself weak with all who were weak.<a name=347:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And, thirdly, the important truth, already mentioned, is set forth, that the assembly, in these circumstances, was cast more immediately on God -- the inexhaustible source for it of grace and strength, of which it was to avail itself in an immediate way by faith -- a resource which could never fail it.<a name=347:12></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#46:347">footnote</a></i>)
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=348>[Page 348]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I resume the consideration of the text with verse 12, which begins the epistle after the introductory portion.<a name=348:1></a> Paul was a prisoner at Rome.<a name=348:2></a> The enemy appeared to have gained a great victory in thus restraining his activity; but by the power of God, who orders all things and who acted in the apostle, even the devices of the adversary were turned to the furtherance of the gospel.<a name=348:3></a> In the first place, the imprisonment of the apostle made the gospel known, where it would not otherwise have been preached, in high places at Rome; and many other brethren, reassured as to the apostle's position,(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#46:348">footnote</a></i>) became more bold to preach the gospel without fear.<a name=348:4></a> But there was another way in which this absence of the apostle had an effect.<a name=348:5></a> Many -- who, in the presence of his power and his gifts, were necessarily powerless and insignificant persons -- could make themselves of some importance, when, in the unsearchable but perfect ways of God, this mighty instrument of His grace was set aside.<a name=348:6></a> They could hope to shine and attract attention when the rays of this resplendent light were intercepted by the walls of a prison.<a name=348:7></a> Jealous but hidden when he was present, they availed themselves of his absence to bestir themselves; whether false brethren or jealous Christians, they sought in his absence to impair his authority in the assembly, and his happiness.<a name=348:8></a> They only added to both.<a name=348:9></a> God was with His servant; and, instead of the self-seeking which instigated these sorry preachers of the truth, there was found in Paul the pure desire for the proclamation of the good news of Christ, the whole value of which he deeply felt, and which he desired above all, be it in what way it might.<a name=348:10></a>

		John enters farther into this character of Christ: in his epistle therefore we find more of that which He is in His nature and character, than of what we shall be with Him in the glory.<a name=368:3></a> Peter, building on the same foundation as the others, waits however for that which shall be revealed.<a name=368:4></a> His pilgrimage was indeed towards heaven, to obtain a treasure which was preserved there, which shall be revealed in the last time; but it is more connected with that which had been already revealed.<a name=368:5></a> From his point of view, the morning star on which Paul lived appeared only on the extreme horizon.<a name=368:6></a> For him practical life was that of Jesus among the Jews.<a name=368:7></a> He could not say with Paul, "Be ye followers of me".<a name=368:8></a> The effect of the revelation of the heavenly glory of Christ, between His going away and His reappearance, and that of the union of all Christians to Him in heaven, was fully realised in him only who received it.<a name=368:9></a> Faithful through grace to this revelation, having no other object which guided his steps, or to divide his heart, he gives himself as an example.<a name=368:10></a> He truly followed Christ, but the form of his life was peculiar, on account of the way in which God had called him; and it is thus that Christians possessing this revelation ought to walk.<a name=368:11></a>

		It was not to turn their eyes from Christ; it is on having the eyes constantly fixed upon Him that he insists.<a name=368:13></a> It was this which characterised the apostle, and in this he gives himself as an example.<a name=368:14></a> But the character of this looking to Jesus was special.<a name=368:15></a> It was not a Christ known on earth who was its object, but a Christ glorified whom he had seen in heaven.<a name=368:16></a> To press ever forward to this end formed the character of his life; even as this same glory of Christ, as a testimony to the bringing in divine righteousness and to the assembly's position, formed the basis of his teaching.<a name=368:17></a> Therefore he can say, "Be followers of me".<a name=368:18></a> His gaze was ever fixed on the heavenly Christ, who had shone before his eyes and still shone before his faith.<a name=368:19></a> The Philippians were thus to walk together, and to mark those

		who followed the apostle's example; because (for evidently it was a period in which the assembly as a whole had much departed from her first love and her normal condition) there were many who, while bearing the name of Christ and having once given good hope, so that the apostle speaks of them with tears, were enemies of the cross of Christ.<a name=369:1></a> For the cross on earth, in our life, answers to the heavenly glory on high.<a name=369:2></a> It is not the assembly at Philippi which is the subject here, but the condition of the outward universal assembly.<a name=369:3></a> Many were already calling themselves Christians, who joined to that great name a life which had the earth and earthly things for its object.<a name=369:4></a> The apostle did not acknowledge them.<a name=369:5></a> They were there; it was not a matter of local discipline, but a condition of Christianity, in which even all were seeking their own interest; and, spirituality being thus lowered, the Christ of glory little realised, many who had no life at all might walk among them without being detected, by those who had so little life themselves and scarcely walked better than they did.<a name=369:6></a> For it does not appear that they who were minding earthly things committed any evil that required public discipline.<a name=369:7></a> The general low tone of spirituality among the real Christians left the others free to walk with them; and the presence of the latter debased Still more the standard of godliness of life.<a name=369:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But this state of things did not escape the spiritual eye of the apostle, which, fixed on the glory, discerned readily and clearly all that had not that glory for its motive; and the Spirit has given us the divine judgment, most grave and solemn, with regard to this state of things.<a name=369:9></a> No doubt it has grown enormously worse since then, and its elements have developed and established themselves in a manner and in proportions that are very differently characterised; but the moral principles with regard to walk remain ever the same for the assembly.<a name=369:10></a> The same evil is present to be avoided, and the same efficacious means for avoiding it.<a name=369:11></a> There is the same blessed example to follow, the same heavenly Saviour to be the glorious object of our faith, the same life to live if we desire to be Christians indeed.<a name=369:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That which characterised these persons who professed the name of Christ was, that their hearts were set upon earthly things.<a name=369:13></a> Thus the cross had not its practical power -- it would have been a contradiction.<a name=369:14></a> Their end therefore was destruction.<a name=369:15></a> The true Christian was not such; his conversation was

		in heaven and not on the earth; his moral life was spent in heaven, his true relationships were there.<a name=370:1></a> From thence he expected Christ as a Saviour, that is to say, to deliver him from the earth, from this earthly system far from God here below For salvation is always viewed in this epistle as the final result of the conflict, the result due to the almighty power of the Lord.<a name=370:2></a> Then, when Christ shall come to take the assembly to Himself -- Christians, truly heavenly, shall be like Him in His heavenly glory, a likeness which is the object of their pursuit at all times (compare <a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:2">1 John  3:2</a>).<a name=370:3></a> Christ will accomplish it in them, conforming their bodies of humiliation to His glorious body according to the power whereby He is able to subdue all things to Himself.<a name=370:4></a> Then the apostle and all Christians will have attained the end, the resurrection from among the dead.<a name=370:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such is the tenor of this chapter.<a name=370:6></a> Christ, seen in glory, is the spring of energy to christian life, to win Christ, so that all else is loss; as Christ making Himself of no reputation is the spring of christian graciousness of walk: the two parts of christian life which we are too apt to sacrifice one to another or at least to pursue one forgetful of the other.<a name=370:7></a> In both Paul singularly shines.<a name=370:8></a> In the following chapter we have superiority to circumstances.<a name=370:9></a> This also is Paul's experience and state; for it will be remarked that it is the personal experience of Paul which runs all through his (humanly speaking) faultless experience -- not perfection.<a name=370:10></a> Likeness to Christ in glory is the only standard of that.<a name=370:11></a> As to this third chapter, many have inquired whether the thing aimed at was a spiritual assimilation to Christ here, or a complete assimilation to Him in the glory.<a name=370:12></a> This is rather to forget the import of what the apostle says, namely, that the sight and the desire of the heavenly glory, the desire of possessing Christ Himself thus glorified, was that which formed the heart here below.<a name=370:13></a> An object here below to be attained in oneself could not be found, since Christ is on high; it would be to separate the heart from the object which forms it to its own likeness.<a name=370:14></a> But although we never reach the mark here below, since it is a glorified Christ and resurrection from among the dead, yet its pursuit assimilates us more and more to Him.<a name=370:15></a> The object in the glory forms the life which answers to it here below.<a name=370:16></a> Were a light at the end of a long straight alley, I never have the light itself till I am arrived there; but I have ever increasing light in proportion as I go forward; I know it better; I am more in the light myself.<a name=370:17></a> Thus it is

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Philippians were therefore to stand fast in the Lord.<a name=371:2></a> This is difficult when the general tone is lowered; painful also, for one's walk becomes much more solitary, and the hearts of others are straitened.<a name=371:3></a> But the Spirit has very plainly given us the example, the principle, the character, and the strength of this walk.<a name=371:4></a> With the eye on Christ all is easy; and communion with Him gives light and certainty; and is worth all the rest which perhaps we lose.<a name=371:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle nevertheless spoke gently of those persons.<a name=371:6></a> They were not like the false judaising teachers who corrupted the sources of life, and stopped up the path of communion with God in love.<a name=371:7></a> They had lost this life of communion, or had never had more than the appearance of it.<a name=371:8></a> He wept for them.<a name=371:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think that the apostle sent his letter by Epaphroditus, who probably also wrote it from the apostle's dictation; as was done with regard to all the epistles, except that to the Galatians, which, as he tells us, he wrote with his own hand.<a name=371:10></a> When therefore he says (chapter 4: 3), "true [or faithful] yokefellow", he speaks as I think, of Epaphroditus, and addresses him.<a name=371:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But he notices also two sisters even, who were not of one mind in resisting the enemy.<a name=371:12></a> In every way he desired unity of heart and mind.<a name=371:13></a> He entreats Epaphroditus (if indeed it be he) as the Lord's servant to help those faithful women who had laboured in concert with Paul to spread the gospel.<a name=371:14></a> Euodias and Syntyche were perhaps of the number -- the connection of thought makes it probable.<a name=371:15></a> Their activity, having gone beyond the measure of their spiritual life, betrayed them into an exercise of self-will which set them at variance.<a name=371:16></a> Nevertheless they were not forgotten, together with Clement and others, who were fellow-labourers with the apostle himself, whose names were in the book of life.<a name=371:17></a> For love for the Lord remembers all that His grace does; and this grace has a place for each of His own.<a name=371:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle returns to the practical exhortations addressed to the faithful, with regard to their ordinary life, that they might walk according to their heavenly calling.<a name=371:19></a> "Rejoice in the Lord".<a name=371:20></a> If he even weeps over many who call themselves Christians, he rejoices always in the Lord; in Him is that which nothing can alter.<a name=371:21></a> This is not an indifference to sorrow which hinders weeping, but it is a spring of joy which enlarges when there is distress, because of its immutability, and which

		becomes even more pure in the heart the more it becomes the only one; and it is in itself the only spring that is infinitely pure.<a name=372:1></a> When it is our only spring, we thereby love others.<a name=372:2></a> If we love them besides Him, we lose something of Him.<a name=372:3></a> When through exercise of heart we are weaned from all other springs, His joy remains in all its purity, and our concern for others partakes of this same purity.<a name=372:4></a> Nothing moreover troubles this joy, because Christ never changes.<a name=372:5></a> The better we know Him, the better are we able to enjoy that which is ever enlarging through knowing Him.<a name=372:6></a> But he exhorts Christians to rejoice: it is a testimony to the worth of Christ, it is their true portion.<a name=372:7></a> Four years in prison chained to a soldier had not hindered his doing it, nor being able to exhort others more at ease than he.<a name=372:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this same thing will make them moderate and meek; their passions will not be excited by other things if Christ is enjoyed.<a name=372:9></a> Moreover He is at hand.<a name=372:10></a> A little while, and all for which men strive will give place to Him whose presence bridles the will (or rather puts it aside) and fills the heart.<a name=372:11></a> We are not to be moved by things here below until He shall come.<a name=372:12></a> When He comes, we shall be fully occupied with other things.<a name=372:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Not only are the will and the passions to be bridled and silenced, but anxieties also.<a name=372:14></a> We are in relationship with God; in all things He is our refuge; and events do not disturb Him.<a name=372:15></a> He knows the end from the beginning.<a name=372:16></a> He knows everything, He knows it beforehand; events shake neither His throne, nor His heart; they always accomplish His purposes.<a name=372:17></a> But to us He is love; we are through grace the objects of His tender care.<a name=372:18></a> He listens to us and bows down His ear to hear us.<a name=372:19></a> In all things therefore, instead of disquieting ourselves and weighing everything in our own hearts, we ought to present our requests to God with prayer, with supplication, with a heart that makes itself known (for we are human beings) but with the knowledge of the heart of God (for He loves us perfectly); so that, even while making our petition to Him, we can already give thanks, because we are sure of the answer of His grace, be it what it may; and it is our requests that we are to present to Him.<a name=372:20></a> Nor is it a cold commandment to find out His will and then come: we are to go with our requests.<a name=372:21></a> Hence it does not say, you will have what you ask; but God's peace will keep your hearts.<a name=372:22></a> This is trust; and His peace, the peace of God Himself, shall keep our hearts.<a name=372:23></a> It does not say that our hearts shall keep the peace of God; but, having cast our burden on

	<div class="paragraph">
		Him whose peace nothing can disturb, His peace keeps our hearts.<a name=373:1></a> Our trouble is before Him, and the constant peace of the God of love, who takes charge of everything and knows all beforehand, quiets our disburdened hearts, and imparts to us the peace which is in Himself and which is above all understanding (or at least keeps our hearts by it), even as He Himself is above all the circumstances that can disquiet us, and above the poor human heart that is troubled by them.<a name=373:2></a> Oh, what grace!<a name=373:3></a> that even our anxieties are a means of our being filled with this marvellous peace, if we know how to bring them to God, and true He is.<a name=373:4></a> May we learn indeed how to maintain this intercourse with God and its reality, in order that we may converse with Him and understand His ways with believers!<a name=373:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Moreover, the Christian, although walking (as we have seen) in the midst of evil and of trial, is to occupy himself with all that is good, and is able to do it when thus at peace, to live in this atmosphere, so that it shall pervade his heart, that he shall be habitually where God is to be found.<a name=373:6></a> This is an all-important command.<a name=373:7></a> We may be occupied with evil in order to condemn it; we may be right, but this is not communion with God in that which is good.<a name=373:8></a> But if occupied through His grace with that which is good, with that which comes from Himself, the God of peace is with us.<a name=373:9></a> In trouble we shall have the peace of God; in our ordinary life, if it be of this nature, we shall have the God of peace.<a name=373:10></a> Paul was the practical example of this; with regard to their walk, by following him in that which they had learnt and heard from him and seen in him, they should find that God was with them.<a name=373:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Nevertheless, although such was his experience, he rejoiced greatly that their loving care of him had flourished again.<a name=373:12></a> He could indeed take refuge in God; but it was sweet to him in the Lord to have this testimony on their part.<a name=373:13></a> It is evident that he had been in need; but it was the occasion of more entire trust in God.<a name=373:14></a> We can easily gather this from his language; but, he delicately adds, he would not, by saying that their care of him had now at last flourished again, imply that they had forgotten him.<a name=373:15></a> The care for him was in their hearts; but they had not had the opportunity of giving expression to their love.<a name=373:16></a> Neither did he speak in regard of want; he had learnt -- for it is practical experience and its blessed result we find here -- to be content under all circumstances, and thus to depend on no one.<a name=373:17></a> He knew how to be abased: he knew how to abound;

		in every way he was instructed both to be full and to be hungry, to be in abundance and to suffer want.<a name=374:1></a> He could do all things through Him who strengthened him.<a name=374:2></a> Sweet and precious experience!<a name=374:3></a> not only because it gives ability to meet all circumstances, which is of great price, but because the Lord is known, the constant, faithful, mighty friend of the heart.<a name=374:4></a> It is not 'I can do all things', but "I can do all through him who strengtheneth me".<a name=374:5></a> It is a strength which continually flows from a relationship with Christ, a connection with Him maintained in the heart.<a name=374:6></a> Neither is it only 'One can do all things'.<a name=374:7></a> This is true; but Paul had learnt it practically.<a name=374:8></a> He knew what he could be assured of and reckon on -- what ground he stood on.<a name=374:9></a> Christ had always been faithful to him, had brought him through so many difficulties and through so many seasons of prosperity, that he had learnt to trust in Him, and not in circumstances.<a name=374:10></a> And Christ was the same ever.<a name=374:11></a> Still the Philippians had done well, and it was not forgotten.<a name=374:12></a> From the first God had bestowed this grace upon them, and they had supplied the apostle's need, even when he was not with them.<a name=374:13></a> He remembered it with affection, not that he desired a gift, but fruit to their own account.<a name=374:14></a> "But", he says, "I have all", his heart turning back to the simple expression of his love He was in abundance, having received by Epaphroditus that which they had sent him, an acceptable sacrifice of sweet odour, well-pleasing to God.<a name=374:15></a>

		His heart rested in God; his assurance with regard to the Philippians expresses it.<a name=374:16></a> My God, he says, shall richly supply all your need.<a name=374:17></a> He does not express a wish that God may do so.<a name=374:18></a> He had learnt what his God was by his own experience.<a name=374:19></a> My God, he says, He whom I have learnt to know in all the circumstances through which I have passed, shall fill you with all good things.<a name=374:20></a> And here he returns to His character as he had known Him.<a name=374:21></a> God would do it according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus.<a name=374:22></a> There he had learnt to know Him at the beginning; and such he had known Him all along his varied path, so full of trials here and of joys from above.<a name=374:23></a> Accordingly he thus concludes: "Now unto our God and Father" -- for such He was to the Philippians also -- "be glory for ever and ever".<a name=374:24></a> He applies his own experience of that which God was to him, and his experience of the faithfulness of Christ, to the Philippians.<a name=374:25></a> This satisfied his love, and gave him rest with regard to them.<a name=374:26></a> It is a comfort when we think of the assembly of God.<a name=374:27></a>

		The present state of the assembly, of the children of God, dispersed anew, and often as sheep without a shepherd, is a very different condition of ruin from that in which the apostle wrote; but this only adds more value to the experience of the apostle which God has been pleased to give us; the experience of a heart which trusted in God alone, and which applies this experience to the condition of those who are deprived of the natural resources that belonged to the organised body, to the body of Christ as God had formed it on earth.<a name=375:3></a> As a whole, the epistle shews proper christian experience, that is, superiority, as walking in the Spirit, to everything through which we have to pass.<a name=375:4></a> It is remarkable to see that sin is not mentioned in it, nor flesh, save to say he had no confidence in it.<a name=375:5></a>

		The reader will remark that chapter 3 sets the glory before the Christian and gives the energy of christian life; chapter 2, the self-emptying and abasement of Christ, and founds thereon the graciousness of the christian life, and thoughtfulness of others: while the last chapter gives a blessed superiority to all circumstances.<a name=375:7></a>
