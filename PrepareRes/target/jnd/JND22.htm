		<i>N</i>.<a name=1:1></a> Well, James, you expect M.<a name=1:2></a>, as it was arranged.<a name=1:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>James</i>.<a name=1:4></a> Yes, sir; he will be here, no doubt, directly.<a name=1:5></a> Pray sit down, sir.<a name=1:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=1:7></a> Thank you.<a name=1:8></a> How are you getting on?<a name=1:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>James</i>.<a name=1:10></a> I find my spirit happy and at peace.<a name=1:11></a> I enjoy the word now with Mary and the children.<a name=1:12></a> I feel I am very weak, but I am conscious that my peace rests on Christ's perfect work, and as to the certainty of it, on God's own word; while I enjoy it within in my own soul.<a name=1:13></a> It makes me wonderfully happy, for I see it all flowing from God's blessed love.<a name=1:14></a> I know He loves me, unworthy as I am, but then, I have no difficulty in believing it because of Christ.<a name=1:15></a> I hope I may be able to glorify Him through His grace.<a name=1:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=1:17></a> The Lord be praised, James; and this is but the earnest of a more perfect enjoyment still of what now we know in part and see through a glass darkly.<a name=1:18></a> Our present Christian joys have the stamp of eternity on them.<a name=1:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>James</i>.<a name=1:20></a> Yes, sir; poor as our feelings are, we know that what makes us happy now will make us still more happy for ever.<a name=1:21></a> We shall know then better what gives us our joy now.<a name=1:22></a> But He who has brought me to peace is the one who loves me, and whom I hope to see in glory.<a name=1:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=1:24></a> And did your mind get clear the last time as to purgatory?<a name=1:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>James</i>.<a name=1:26></a> It could not but be clear when once one knows Christ's precious blood cleanses from all sin.<a name=1:27></a> I had no thought that they had such strange notions that so deny Christ's work.<a name=1:28></a> It is dreadful.<a name=1:29></a> I did not understand all about the Fathers, but what sets the soul clear is the knowledge of Christ and His grace.<a name=1:30></a> I was thinking since, sir (though there is nothing about purgatory in it), how the beautiful parable of the prodigal son sets all thoughts of it aside -- how that parable would prevent one who really knew the grace of it from ever thinking of such a thing.<a name=1:31></a> However could the Father, when the poor prodigal had all his rags off and the best robe on, that is, Christ Himself, put him in purgatory after?<a name=1:32></a> It is like putting Christ Himself there.<a name=1:33></a> And then I see plainly that once I leave this world I have not the flesh at all, so that I do not know what is to be purged away.<a name=1:34></a> Here, where I have it, I can be exercised and sifted and tried, and for my good, because the flesh is still here in me.<a name=1:35></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=2:1></a> You are quite right, James.<a name=2:2></a> It is a complete confusion between penal suffering and purifying.<a name=2:3></a> If it be really purifying, it is a cruel thing to get it shortened by indulgences.<a name=2:4></a> If it be penal, it is contrary to all the testimony of the gospel.<a name=2:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>James</i>.<a name=2:6></a> What are indulgences?<a name=2:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=2:8></a> They are decrees of the pope, by which, in virtue of the merits of Christ and the saints, he delivers souls in purgatory from a part or all of the punishment they have to go through.<a name=2:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>Mrs.<a name=2:10></a> J</i>.<a name=2:11></a> Dear, who would have thought of such things?<a name=2:12></a> Why, it is not Christianity at all, sir.<a name=2:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=2:14></a> Surely it is not.<a name=2:15></a> I dare say we shall get upon this subject before we have done.<a name=2:16></a> It was the immediate occasion of the Reformation.<a name=2:17></a> They sold them in the most shameful or shameless way to get money to build St.<a name=2:18></a> Peter's, the magnificent cathedral at Rome.<a name=2:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the Fathers, James, you have no need to think of them.<a name=2:20></a> They are no authority for anything, and indeed contradict each other continually like other men: only there was more superstition and ignorance in them than in most cultivated persons now, with real piety in some; as to others, it is very doubtful if they had any.<a name=2:21></a> I have referred to them because it was necessary to meet what was alleged.<a name=2:22></a> And now that their doubts and contradictions are shewn, we may dismiss them without passion and without fear.<a name=2:23></a> They have indeed been altered, and passages cast out by the Roman Catholics, but not so as much to affect such a mass of writings.<a name=2:24></a> But Rome has what is called an index expurgatory, by which some books are prohibited, and others are directed to be printed without such a passage, or changing it, or the like, when any passage militates against the doctrines of the Roman system.<a name=2:25></a> And this has been done.<a name=2:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>James</i>.<a name=2:27></a> Dear, what a crafty system!<a name=2:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=2:29></a> It is a system little known.<a name=2:30></a> They have published a kind of imitation of the Psalms, one hundred and fifty of them in number, just like the Psalms, and with a general resemblance, but have put the Virgin Mary instead of the Lord.<a name=2:31></a>

		<i>Mrs.<a name=3:1></a> J</i>.<a name=3:2></a> What wickedness!<a name=3:3></a> It is all planned so.<a name=3:4></a> I am glad, James, you knew what it was before you got drawn in.<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>James</i>.<a name=3:6></a> So am I, I am sure; it is a mercy to be kept from it in any way, but more still when it is by knowing the grace of God, which makes me see not only that there are wrong things, but that the foundation of their whole system is wrong.<a name=3:7></a> They do not build on grace and redemption, but on man and works.<a name=3:8></a> That I see plainly.<a name=3:9></a> But here is M.<a name=3:10></a> Good day, Bill, sit down.<a name=3:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=3:12></a> Good day, M.<a name=3:13></a> We have waited to go on with the subject proposed till you came.<a name=3:14></a> We are to speak of the word of God and of the church.<a name=3:15></a> We can still take Milner, who, in a brief way, will say all that is to be said.<a name=3:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>M</i>.<a name=3:17></a> Yes, we must seek the right rule of faith, and that is the written and unwritten word, the church being the interpreter and judge.<a name=3:18></a> We must have a living judge of controversy, or there is no end to disputes.<a name=3:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=3:20></a> The thing to be ultimately judged is not doctrines, my good friend, but souls.<a name=3:21></a> And the difference is most serious.<a name=3:22></a> I am not going to avoid the other question, that is, the means of discovering the truth; but while you profess to have the true church where alone salvation is, you have people in crowds who are lost, and none who know whether they are saved after all.<a name=3:23></a> But when you speak of judging what is the truth, your principle is wholly false.<a name=3:24></a> God does not judge of truth; He reveals it.<a name=3:25></a> Man is not to judge of truth, but, if God has revealed, he is bound on his peril to receive it.<a name=3:26></a> Men will be judged according to the truth they have before them.<a name=3:27></a> They that have sinned without law shall perish without law, and they that have sinned under law shall be judged by the law.<a name=3:28></a> If they have rejected Christ, they are still more guilty.<a name=3:29></a> The Holy Ghost was to convict the world of sin, because they had not believed in Him, and if they did not, they would die in their sins.<a name=3:30></a> If they do believe from the heart, they are saved, at least if God's declaration is to be believed.<a name=3:31></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>M</i>.<a name=3:32></a> "Saved?<a name=3:33></a>" you mean hope to be saved.<a name=3:34></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=3:35></a> I do not, they are not yet out of trial and temptation, but they are reconciled to God, have peace with Him.<a name=3:36></a> As scripture speaks: -- He has saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to our own works, but according to His own purpose and grace; 2 Timothy 1: 9.<a name=3:37></a> So Titus 3: 5; but according to His mercy He saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost, which He shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour.<a name=3:38></a> They have eternal life.<a name=3:39></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>M</i>.<a name=4:1></a> That is, they hope to have it.<a name=4:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=4:3></a> Not at all.<a name=4:4></a> Of course, in all its fulness and glory they have not got it yet.<a name=4:5></a> But the scripture says, "This is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.<a name=4:6></a> He that hath the Son hath life: and he that hath not the Son hath not life.<a name=4:7></a>" Again, John the baptist says, "He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life, and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.<a name=4:8></a>" What proves the Roman Catholic system to be so utterly false is that it teaches men as if the grace of God had not brought salvation at all.<a name=4:9></a> Men are just where they were if there was no Christ; they have to make their peace with God, whereas Christ has made peace by the blood of His cross.<a name=4:10></a> According to Romanism they have to gain eternal life, as the law required, "Do this, and thou shalt live.<a name=4:11></a>" Christianity says he that hath the Son hath life.<a name=4:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>M</i>.<a name=4:13></a> And must not a man work to get life?<a name=4:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=4:15></a> Surely not.<a name=4:16></a> How can he work if he has not got it?<a name=4:17></a> He believes on Christ as a poor sinner, and has life in Him; and then works to serve God and glorify Him, and grow on in the life he has got.<a name=4:18></a> "He that heareth my words, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment, but is passed from death unto life," says Christ.<a name=4:19></a> Nothing is more false than supposing that no good works can be done unless we are to gain life by them; I should say none can be done till we have life.<a name=4:20></a> Do angels do good works?<a name=4:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>M</i>.<a name=4:26></a> Well, no, they are in heaven.<a name=4:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=4:28></a> What do they do it for, then?<a name=4:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>M</i>.<a name=4:30></a> Why, they are blessed things, they do nothing else.<a name=4:31></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=4:32></a> Well, M.<a name=4:33></a>, we can hardly say we do nothing else, but as to the motive it shews that there is another way of doing right besides gaining life and heaven by it.<a name=4:34></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Besides, all real duties and right affections flow from the relationships we are already in.<a name=4:35></a> I mean this.<a name=4:36></a> If you were my servant it would be your duty to act and feel as such.<a name=4:37></a> James' children's duties and their right feelings flow from their being his children, and living in the consciousness that they are so.<a name=4:38></a> They have not, cannot have, such towards you and me, because they are not our children.<a name=4:39></a> So with a wife and every relation of life.<a name=4:40></a> Now, we must be really children of God before the duties of children can apply to us, and before we can have the affections suited to that place.<a name=4:41></a> We are children of God by faith in Christ Jesus, and our duties and right affections flow from this -- can have no existence till we are in that relation.<a name=4:42></a> We have never to work to get into any true living relationship, for the duties cannot exist till we are in it; indeed, it is not possible in the nature of things.<a name=4:43></a> The Christian has duties, and has to cultivate holy affections, but it is because he is a child of God, and knows it.<a name=4:44></a> For he can have neither the feeling nor the conscience of his duty as a child till he knows he is such.<a name=4:45></a> We have difficulties and temptations to overcome, and God does encourage us by the reward of glory, the crown of life; but He never tells us to gain life by our works: the law, if indeed this can be said, does.<a name=4:46></a> But we are all condemned on that ground, because we have not kept it.<a name=4:47></a> The gift of God is eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=4:48></a> What are good works, M.<a name=4:49></a>?<a name=4:50></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=5:3></a> Then you never can do any according to your system, because you do them to gain eternal life, to merit heaven for yourself.<a name=5:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>M</i>.<a name=5:5></a> But you would look for something above human nature.<a name=5:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=5:7></a> Surely I should; I look for grace -- grace and life from Jesus Christ working within.<a name=5:8></a> He has saved by His death.<a name=5:9></a> The Roman Catholic system is (not theoretically perhaps, but practically) the deadly heresy of Pelagianism.<a name=5:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=5:13></a> Believing that there is strength in man to do good and merit life by his works.<a name=5:14></a> And though they talk of grace, it is practically man's own efforts; there may be sacramental grace referred to, but no personal practical dependence on grace.<a name=5:15></a> The Roman Catholic system hides it under hard words, and distinguishes between grace of condignity, that is, what a man sufficiently deserves -- merit in which the works deserve a reward for their own worth; and grace of congruity, what fits a man to receive, though he be not worthy in the way of merit; but, in point of fact, a man merits eternal life by his own doings and efforts, which in principle and substance and verity is Pelagianism.<a name=5:16></a> Christ delivered the Old Testament saints, they say, out of limbo, and set us to keep the new law.<a name=5:17></a>

		<i>James</i>.<a name=6:1></a> Well, I am sure I never had merit, or fitness, or anything, unless as a poor sinner is fit for grace, because he is one and wants it.<a name=6:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=6:3></a> But tell me, M.<a name=6:4></a> You believe that life is given, and pardon too, in baptism, do you not?<a name=6:5></a>

		<i>N</i>.<a name=6:7></a> Very well, according to Rome we are born of God in it, -- and have remission of sin, original and all actual sins, if we have committed any.<a name=6:8></a> It cleanses from sin, makes us Christians and children of God.<a name=6:9></a> We are born of water and of the Spirit, and what a child has contracted by generation is cleansed by regeneration.<a name=6:10></a><a href="#6:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Note, then, if divine life be lost, it never can be had again.<a name=6:26></a> And if life be not lost when man dies in mortal sin, a man may go to hell and yet have faith, as born of God -- only no grace.<a name=6:27></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#6:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>Any authorised Romish catechism on the baptismal service may be consulted, or Cat. Conc. Trid. 42; and Conc. Trid. 5, 4, for the last words of the sentence. The Roman doctrine on baptism speaks very little of giving life in it; much more of taking away sin, original and actual, and insists on taking it away, not removing imputation only, adding that concupiscence which does remain is not *properly* sin, as Cat. Conc. Trid. on Baptism 43. It teaches it, however, distinctly, not only in the term made children of God, in every catechism and the baptism service, but very definitely also Cat. Conc. Trid. (Lord's Prayer) sect. 10. It is altogether remarkable how very little is said of life in authorised Romish teaching. Eternal life is wholly in the future, Cat. Conc. Trid. (on the Creed), art. 12. They are replenished with divine grace, a divine quality. See on Baptism 50, and Cat. Conc. Trid. 6, 7, where hope and charity must be added to have eternal life. However, they are said to be born again, made children of God, and incorporated in Christ by baptism.

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the matter really stands thus: The doctrine of catechisms and every Roman authority tell us that mortal sin, as the word indeed implies, is the death of the soul, deprives the soul of life or sanctifying grace which is the life of the soul.<a name=7:7></a> I take the words of one of many catechisms, "Why is it called mortal?<a name=7:8></a> Because it kills the soul, by depriving it of its true life which is sanctifying grace, and because it brings everlasting death and damnation on the soul.<a name=7:9></a>" Another, "By destroying the life of the soul, which is the grace of God.<a name=7:10></a>" Another, "that which killeth the soul in a spiritual manner, because it deprives us of the grace of God, which is the spiritual life of the soul.<a name=7:11></a>" The two first are American, sanctioned each by a different prelate of New York, the last Irish, drawn up by the Most Revelation Dr.<a name=7:12></a> Reilly.<a name=7:13></a> Now we are taught by the Council of Trent itself, That they are cleansed by regeneration from what they contracted by generation, referring to John 3.<a name=7:14></a> They are born again of water and the Spirit.<a name=7:15></a> They are frequently called 'born again' (<i>renati)</i>.<a name=7:16></a> And in the Catechism of the Council of Trent it is insisted that baptism cannot be repeated: "that this accords with the nature of the thing, and with reason is understood from the very idea of baptism which is a certain spiritual regeneration.<a name=7:17></a> As then, by virtue of the laws of the nature, we are generated and born but once, and as St.<a name=7:18></a> Augustine observes, there is no returning to the womb; so, in like manner, there is but one spiritual generation, nor is baptism ever at any time to be repeated.<a name=7:19></a>"<a href="#7:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a>

	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#7:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>There is a strange and startling anomaly on the point of mortal sin, surely a very grave one, of which Irish catechisms furnish an example. Each gives a catalogue of deadly or mortal sins, but they are different. One is by the Right Revelation Dr. Plunket, thirteenth edition, Dublin, 1827. How many are the chief kinds of mortal sin? Seven, called capital sins. Which are the seven capital sins? Pride, covetousness, luxury, anger, gluttony, envy and sloth. The other is by the Most Revelation Dr. Reilly, Dublin, 1827. Both are printed by the same printer, Wogan. How many capital or deadly sins? Seven: pride, covetousness, lust, gluttony, envy, anger, sloth. So in two dioceses in Ireland, the sins which would take a man to hell and kill his soul were different.

		<a class="footnote" name="#9:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>Dr. Milner's book is craftily written. He introduces the whole inquiry by essays, etc., of members of the supposed society, by which the truths of natural and revealed religion are proved true as a starting point. But if I am to discover a true religion, this cannot be, for the true one is discovered, and fundamentally the true faith in the revealed religion already demonstrated. Else I have not the true religion. But that is found, it seems, without the church at all, and what is the professed inquiry in the book is settled. But this avoids admitting openly the authority of scripture in itself. But then, having the true religion of true faith, I have not to discover it, but whether Romanism is consistent with it. Every true Christian believes in the authority of the word of God: with this I do not discover a religion at all, but, having it, judge the pretensions of the Romanist to the possession and the exclusive possession of it. The whole statement of the case is a subtle fallacy, for which the way has been paved by what precedes. We are not discovering a religion, but judging Romanism, and Protestantism too, if you please, when I am a Christian. In a word, if I have natural and revealed religion demonstrated, I have discovered the true religion, for the demonstrated revealed religion is the true one. Our inquiry is not then the discovery of Christ's religion; it is discovered and demonstrated. We are inquiring if Romanism, the *state* of the church, is according to what has been demonstrated.

		I was in a cabin in Ireland where I was known, and began speaking to the brother-in-law of the man of the house about the scripture; his niece, a young woman, who was present, said, "But they tell me, sir, this is a bad book -- that the devil wrote it.<a name=12:31></a>" She was very ignorant, and could not read.<a name=12:32></a> I said, "That is a shocking blasphemy.<a name=12:33></a> (I know they excuse themselves when any intelligent person is there by saying, It is only because of the false translation; however, so it passed.<a name=12:34></a>) But I will not reason with you, but read you a bit, and you shall tell me yourself if the devil wrote it.<a name=12:35></a>"

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But to return to our point.<a name=13:16></a> I will help you.<a name=13:17></a> None are addressed to what can be called in the modern term "clergy" at all save three: two to Timothy and one to Titus.<a name=13:18></a> These three were addressed to those specially engaged in the service of Christ.<a name=13:19></a> The rest are addressed to all the Christians either of a locality or in general, the elders among them in Peter being noticed in their place among the rest, and the bishops and deacons along with all the rest in Paul's to the Philippians.<a name=13:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus that to the Romans, "To all that be in Rome beloved of God, saints called.<a name=13:21></a>" Here you could not tell from the Epistle if there were such a thing as elders or bishops.<a name=13:22></a> 1 Corinthians: "To the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, saints called, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours.<a name=13:23></a>" I suppose that all saints, and there were many ignorant ones, ought to have received and obeyed the apostle's teaching.<a name=13:24></a> Here too we have not a hint about any elders.<a name=13:25></a> The receiving the apostle's orders was a test of the spirituality of their state, "If any be spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord.<a name=13:26></a>" And so John says, "He that is of God heareth us.<a name=13:27></a>" In 2 Corinthians it was to all the saints which were in all Achaia, the province in Greece where Corinth was.<a name=13:28></a> The Epistle to the Galatians is addressed to the churches of Galatia.<a name=13:29></a> Here the whole body of saints is addressed too.<a name=13:30></a>

		I need not notice every Epistle, because it is only to repeat the same thing; they are addressed to all the faithful.<a name=14:1></a> I may notice an expression in the first Epistle to the Thessalonians, which shews it in a distinct manner.<a name=14:2></a> Paul says at the end of it, "I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read by all the holy brethren.<a name=14:3></a>" Colossians and Laodicea were to exchange Epistles, and they were to be read in the churches.<a name=14:4></a> Peter's Epistles were addressed to all the dispersed residing in various provinces.<a name=14:5></a> In John's we get if possible a stronger evidence.<a name=14:6></a> He distinguishes the Christians, while addressing all in general, into classes of fathers, young men, and little children, and writes more special words to these last, pressing on them their competency in virtue of having the Holy Ghost to understand everything, and says, though warning and teaching them with all affection, they had not need of any one to do so.<a name=14:7></a> And in his second Epistle he writes to a lady and desires her to judge those who came teaching and preaching by the doctrine they brought.<a name=14:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we have ample evidence that the scriptures were addressed not to the teaching body (with the exception of three Epistles of Paul, which, however, are full of instruction to all, because he tells Timothy and Titus how all ought to act), but by the teaching body to the mass of the faithful.<a name=14:9></a> If Rome has reduced the faithful to a state of ignorance which makes them incapable of it, the guilt is on her shoulders.<a name=14:10></a> It is a proof that she cannot enlighten them.<a name=14:11></a> The only thing to do is for them to go back to the scriptures which she has practically deprived them of.<a name=14:12></a>

		Dr.<a name=15:1></a> Milner admits that this is so, as regards the heathen, that is, that his principle does not hold good; but then, as he says, there is a special grace accorded.<a name=15:2></a> I admit the special grace -- there is never any good or blessing without it: but I understand very well what Dr.<a name=15:3></a> Milner is about too.<a name=15:4></a> It is quite evident that in the case of heathens the church has no authority, for they as heathens do not own it; they must in any case become Christians first.<a name=15:5></a> Thus we find that in this case the word of God has power and authority without the church.<a name=15:6></a> Men discover the true religion without the authority of the church.<a name=15:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is a grand difficulty for Dr.<a name=15:8></a> Milner; because after all, when Christianity has really to be discovered (as in the case of a heathen), it is discovered by the power of the word through grace, without the church at all.<a name=15:9></a> That is, in a word, that, in the only real case where the true religion is discovered, it is discovered without the authority of the church.<a name=15:10></a> Now for communicating the knowledge of Christ's religion where it is professed, there are similar means, as I have said, ministers, parents, and the like.<a name=15:11></a> And do you mean to say that special grace is for heathens to receive the word, but that there is none needed, and none given for professing Christians?<a name=15:12></a> It is needed for every man.<a name=15:13></a> But, remark further, this way of discovering Christ's religion is not a rule of faith.<a name=15:14></a> A minister, a priest, as you call him, is not a rule of faith; a friend or a mother is surely not a rule of faith.<a name=15:15></a> Yet they are the means in an ordinary way of the discovering, or more properly of the reception of, Christ's religion.<a name=15:16></a> Now the confusion of these things is the source of all the fallacy; because the means of discovering need not be infallible -- need not be, in the sense here stated, secure nor universal; in point of fact, unless when scripture is the means, it never is; on the contrary, it is adapted to the state and capacity of the person evangelized or taught.<a name=15:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A rule of faith must be secure, but as it is not the means of communicating Christ's religion (though it may be such a means), it is not as a rule required to be adapted to such universal communication.<a name=15:18></a> It subsists in the form in which it was originally given to be referred to.<a name=15:19></a> Now these two things we have without the authority of the church at all: apostles, ministers, parents, and others, communicating Christ's religion according to the language or capacity of hearers and learners; and we have the scriptures the fixed and unchanged rule to which all teaching is to be referred.<a name=15:20></a> And note this well: if the truth contained in scripture be not received, if a man remain an infidel, or become a confirmed heretic, the authority of the church is of no use.<a name=15:21></a> For such do not acknowledge it.<a name=15:22></a> She must in result leave them where they are, unless she burn them (as Rome indeed has done by hundreds and thousands) or banish and imprison them.<a name=15:23></a> But that is only copying the heathen who did the same thing.<a name=15:24></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#18:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>Baronius says he must give the names of popes as dates, but how can he own as popes the sons of the mistresses of the Marquis of Tuscany, whom they put in to be popes by their guilty influence? (Bar. An. 912, 7, 8.) There were the two parties, the Roman nobles and the Marquis of Tuscany, who in turn put in the popes, or drove them out, so that there were often two at a time, and each habitually when he got the upper hand quashed all the ordinations of his adversary as invalid. (Bar. An. 907, 3.) Auxilius wrote a book on the ordinations, exordinations, and super-ordinations of the Roman pontiffs. (See Baronius Account of Sergius, 908, 2.) At last the Emperor came in to introduce some decent order. But this lasted a great while. We may examine this a little more exactly when we come to succession as a proof of the true church. Here I only give the undoubted facts, which may be seen in Baronius as in other historians.

		Again, on the point of authority, which you consider so important, the gravest differences exist.<a name=26:1></a> The famous four articles by which the Gallican church defended its liberties were condemned as earnestly as possible by the Papal advocates.<a name=26:2></a> In these the synod of French bishops declares that the decrees of the Council of Constance, which maintained the authority of general councils as superior to that of the pope, are approved and ratified by the Gallican church; and that the decisions of the pope are not infallible in points of faith unless they be accompanied by the consent of the church.<a name=26:3></a>

		Another point insisted on by Dr.<a name=26:12></a> Milner, which has nothing to do with the rule of faith, but which I may do well to take up as it is noticed, is this, that sovereign princes have acted more in the Reformation than theologians.<a name=26:13></a> The truth is that sovereign princes, long oppressed in the rights and authority which God confers on the magistrate, profited by the public movement, brought about by the faith of individuals though long prepared by the working of God's Spirit, to throw off the unjust authority of the pope.<a name=26:14></a> This was according to God's will, who gives to the sovereign his authority, and brought about by His providence.<a name=26:15></a> With this the rule of faith has surely nothing to do.<a name=26:16></a> It was the righteous resumption by he Civil magistrate of an authority to which the pope had no title.<a name=26:17></a> Whether they abused this is nothing to the purpose.<a name=26:18></a> Civil statutes had been passed constantly against the absorption of lands into the hands of monks and others -- mortmain as it was called.<a name=26:19></a> They evaded them by the introduction of uses (that is, when it was forbidden to a monastery to hold lands, they were given to a layman to hold it to their use, to the peril of their souls if they did not); and then when this was condemned by the Statute of Uses, they evaded that by what are called trusts.<a name=26:20></a>

		But I go farther.<a name=47:1></a> There is distinct proof that the apostles themselves recognized no successors.<a name=47:2></a> Paul insists on the diligent care of the elders, because he had no successor.<a name=47:3></a> This is very distinct.<a name=47:4></a> He knew (Acts 20) that after his decease grievous wolves would enter in, and perverse men would arise.<a name=47:5></a> Who, after his decease, if he was to have a successor?<a name=47:6></a> Evil would spring up because there was not an apostle to check or control it by his spiritual energy and consequent authority.<a name=47:7></a> He urges the elders, those whom the Holy Ghost had made overseers, to watch -- a thing wholly out of place if another was to succeed him and take his place.<a name=47:8></a> Some say Timothy was afterwards bishop of Ephesus.<a name=47:9></a> There is no evidence of it, but the contrary; but if he were, it upsets the theory altogether, for the same authorities tell us John was at Ephesus, so that we have an apostle there governing and guiding, and yet a successor at the same time to do it as if the apostle were gone.<a name=47:10></a>

		So Peter says, seeing his departure was near, that <i>he</i> would take care they should have these things always in remembrance, and writes his Epistle; but if he had a successor who was to secure the truth, and it be not the scriptures which are to do it through grace, he made a great mistake in the whole matter.<a name=47:11></a> Paul therefore, and Peter and John practically too, all deny the whole theory on which the Romish system is founded.<a name=47:12></a> They know no successor, deny by their words that there will be such, and give other means of security as regards the truth; for Paul is still clearer than Peter as to the scriptures.<a name=47:13></a> Not only does he commend the elders of Ephesus to God and the word of His grace, but he tells us positively that in the last days perilous times should come; that the professing church would be in a horrible state, having a form of godliness but denying the power of it; and that we should turn away from such; and that the security of the faithful Christian would be the scriptures, which are able to make us wise unto salvation.<a name=47:14></a> Not a word of tradition, but the contrary; for Timothy is made to rely on knowing of whom he had learned the things he knew.<a name=47:15></a> This was Paul himself.<a name=47:16></a>

In a preceding part of this treatise he, leaning on human argumentation, says, "If you quote a text, the heretics will quote another, so you are losing your breath"; but his arguments refer to them as a means of convicting heretics, not as the source of truth, and he refers Irenaeus to what was held by all, and not as a proof of an unwritten truth, but as a proof that what the heretics taught of two Gods, a bad and a good one, and the like, did not come from the apostles; it was new, or already condemned by the apostles. The apostles knew all that was revealed, and taught it all. The heretics pretended to some secret or concealed doctrine, but no church had these doctrines. It is a proof of what was taught. The Romanist is clearly on the ground the heretics were on.

		The next proof of tradition Dr; Milner gives is a singularly unhappy one for Romanist doctrines.<a name=74:25></a> "The whole sacred history," he says, "was preserved by the patriarchs in succession, from Adam down to Moses, during the space of two thousand four hundred years by means of tradition.<a name=74:26></a>" Now the flood came in this period, because men had grown so wicked and cast off God that Noah alone remained to be preserved.<a name=74:27></a> And after the flood all the world fell away into idolatry, so that God called Abraham out of it to begin afresh and have a nation for Himself in which He should keep the knowledge of the true God alive by a written law, because men so entirely lost the knowledge of Him when they had not one.<a name=74:28></a> Here is Paul's account of this time, "Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful, but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened; professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds and four-footed beasts, and creeping things.<a name=74:29></a> Wherefore God gave them up to uncleanness .<a name=74:30></a>.<a name=74:31></a>.<a name=74:32></a> .<a name=74:33></a> And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them up to a reprobate mind," etc.<a name=74:34></a> This is a poor but true history of the time when man was left to tradition.<a name=74:35></a> The difference of Romanism now is this -- there is a written word, and they have taken it away and put reproach upon it; and as the heathen corrupted the doctrine of one God by idolatry and many false gods, so the Romanists, when God had sent His Son to bring men back, have corrupted the doctrine of one Divine Mediator by making many human and false ones.<a name=74:36></a>

		It is worth while, though it be long, to recite what the prelates say in what they call the universal African Council of Carthage: -- "No determination of the Fathers has ever taken this authority (of judging its own clergy) from the African church, and the decrees of Nice have openly committed both inferior clergymen and bishops themselves to their metropolitans.<a name=98:1></a> For they have provided most prudently and justly that every matter should be terminated in its own place where it arose.<a name=98:2></a> Nor is it to be thought that to each and every consideration the grace of the Holy Spirit will be wanting by which equity may be prudently perceived by the priests of Christ, and firmly maintained, especially because it is allowed to every one, if he be offended by the judgment on the charges, to appeal to the councils of his province, or even to a universal one.<a name=98:3></a> Unless perhaps there be some one who may think that our God may inspire justice in examining to a single person, whoever it may be, and deny it to innumerable priests assembled in council .<a name=98:4></a>.<a name=98:5></a>.<a name=98:6></a> .<a name=98:7></a> For we have not found it established in any synod of the Fathers that any should be sent as legates of your holiness <i>(tuoe sanctitatis a latere</i>, the common name since for popish legates).<a name=98:8></a> For that which you formerly transmitted by the same Faustinus, our co-bishop, as on the part of the Nicene Council, in the truer copies of the Council of Nice, which we have received, sent from our co-bishop, Cyril, of the church of Alexandria, and the venerable Atticus, prelate of Constantinople, from the authentic copies, which also had already been sent by us to bishop Boniface of venerable memory, your predecessor, by the hands of Innocent, presbyter, and Marcellus, sub-deacon, by whom they were forwarded to us from them (Cyril and Atticus), we have not been able to find anything of the kind.<a name=98:9></a> Also do not think of sending, nor granting, upon any of ours requesting it, any of your clergy as executors (agents to enforce decrees) lest we may seem to introduce the smoky pride of this world into the church of Christ, which offers the light of simplicity and the day-light of lowliness to those who desire to see God.<a name=98:10></a>"<a href="#98:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> And then the council declares that Africa could no longer endure the presence of Faustinus, if brotherly charity were to be preserved.<a name=98:11></a> Apiarius was already put out.<a name=98:12></a>

		I have dwelt more on this because just at this time the pope was seeking to establish his authority over the West, having succeeded, through a quarrel of two prelates, to do it in the south-east corner of France, and in a measure in Eastern Illyria, naming the archbishop of Thessalonica there as "executor" -- what the Africans call the introduction of smoky pride into the church.<a name=100:1></a> This had been done already some 40 years before, when that country was politically transferred to the Eastern empire, and the ambitious popes were afraid it should be ecclesiastically under the influence of Constantinople, the Eastern capital.<a name=100:2></a> But all this was ambition, not infallibility; and when there was moral courage, the pretensions of the pope were entirely rejected as wholly contrary to the canons, as indeed they were before the canons of Nice were made.<a name=100:3></a> Thus did Cyprian, thus Asia Minor, Egypt, and Syria in his day; thus Spain, thus Irenaeus in Gaul; while the popes have been proved both fallible and heretics.<a name=100:4></a>

		How the commission in Matthew 28 was not fulfilled I do not stop to discuss, though I have thought of it too; but we have the apostles' authority in Paul's account for saying that what was settled by the apostles was, that Paul should take the Gentiles, and Peter and the others the Jews, as their sphere of work; and so Paul tells us elsewhere a dispensation was committed (Ephesians 3: 2) to him.<a name=106:14></a> He was debtor to Greeks and barbarians, and to those at Rome too; Romans 1: 14.<a name=106:15></a> He was a minister of the gospel to every creature under heaven, and besides that, specially, a minister of the church (Colossians 2); and it is found on examination that he only, in all the Epistles, speaks of the church (John once of a particular church, not of the whole body).<a name=106:16></a>

		The divine account, therefore, that I have of the dispensation of the gospel and the establishment of the church among the Gentiles is that Paul, not Peter, was the instrument in the Lord's hand for this work.<a name=107:1></a> And Paul very assiduously contends that he derived no fresh knowledge from Peter, and that he did not get his apostleship from man nor by man; and he resisted him to the face when it was needed; Galatians 2.<a name=107:2></a> So that I find from scripture that he to whom the dispensation of the gospel to the Gentiles, and especially Rome, was committed by God (and the ministry of the church too), was in no way subject to Peter, got nothing from him, and owed nothing to him; that God was mighty indeed in Peter to the Jew, but in Paul to the Gentiles; and we know by the Acts that in fact the world, as Paul says, was filled with the gospel by his labours, who rejected diligently all subjection to Peter, without having a hint in God's history of the matter that Peter ever went to a single Gentile after Cornelius, while we have him agreeing that Paul should, and he to the Jews.<a name=107:3></a>

		Further, neither in discourse nor in his Epistles does Peter ever speak of the church as a body on earth, while Paul enlarges and teaches on it everywhere.<a name=107:4></a> No doubt this left him free to preach it to anyone, as it did Paul to preach to Jews, but the mission, the official relationship, of Peter was with Jews, not Gentiles, while the Gentiles were committed to Paul, and he carefully, in the Epistle to the Galatians, sets aside any superior authority of Peter.<a name=107:5></a> Is not this strange if Peter was to be the head of Gentile Christendom, and the rock and foundation of the church?<a name=107:6></a> It seems as if God, foreknowing what man would corruptly make of him, had taken pains for those who own the truth and authority of His word to shew it was impossible; just as He has never given a case in which the blessed Virgin applied to Christ that she was not refused.<a name=107:7></a> The authority of Peter, and deriving ecclesiastical position from him and the rest of the twelve, was a work of the enemy with which Paul had specially to contend, and which he wholly rejects.<a name=107:8></a><a href="#107:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>

		The tradition given by Eusebius from Dionysius of Corinth is clearly false, or has nothing to do with the matter, for it states not merely that Peter and Paul went together to Rome, but that they had also been at Corinth together, and taught the same doctrine, and then gone on to Rome to be martyred together (Eus.<a name=109:1></a> Hist.<a name=109:2></a> Ec.<a name=109:3></a> 2, 25).<a name=109:4></a> Now either this is false, as the Acts prove, if it be taken literally, for it is said, "I have planted," which the Acts and two Epistles to Corinth prove to have been the work of Paul alone, who declares that in Christ Jesus he had begotten them all by the gospel, a fact fully maintained in the Epistle; or if it be not false it is only a flourish of words referring to some visit to Rome (and Corinth on the way when on their way to prison), and in that case the churches were founded long before.<a name=109:5></a> That Peter planted the church of Corinth is undoubtedly false; for not only have we in the Acts the history of its planting by Paul with Silas and Timotheus exclusively, but he says, in his Epistle to them, that if they had ten thousand instructors they had but one father, for in Christ Jesus he had begotten them all by the gospel; 1 Corinthians 4: 15.<a name=109:6></a> Thus, as to the founding of the church, Peter certainly did not found the church at Corinth, and as certainly did not found the church at Rome.<a name=109:7></a> This we are perfectly sure of, as we have (besides the absence of all trace of it in scripture) Paul's Epistle to the Romans and two to the Corinthians, and the history of the Acts, which exclude any possibility of Peter's having done so.<a name=109:8></a> If it be true that they both suffered martyrdom there under Nero, this would say nothing of founding the church there, nor of any official place they had there.<a name=109:9></a> If we turn to those who followed in the See of Rome, the case is, if possible, clearer, for the apostle John survived Peter and Paul some thirty years; so that the first three popes governed one of the pillars among the apostles, which is as absurd as it is wrong.<a name=109:10></a> The notion of the beloved apostle being subject to the supremacy of the possessor of the See of Rome is monstrous.<a name=109:11></a>

		As regards Athanasius, the passage quoted (of which Bellarmine speaks as so beautiful) is a notoriously spurious letter, and placed among the spurious ones by his Benedictine editors; the proofs you can see in Dupin on this Father, and it is a proof only of the practices resorted to by papal advocates to clothe their pretensions with the authority of great names, and which have acquired the name of pious frauds.<a name=116:1></a> We will therefore leave Athanasius, who affords you no help, though he resorted to Rome to help him against the Arians.<a name=116:2></a> It is strange moreover Roman Catholics should quote a letter to Felix, for Felix was a pope thrust in by the Arians, while Liberius was banished by the Arian Emperor; and Athanasius says it was a deed that bore the stamp of antichrist.<a name=116:3></a> Cardinal Baronius, the great Roman Catholic historian, will not admit him to be pope at all, as there cannot be two.<a name=116:4></a> Bellarmine says he was a fresh instance of how solid a foundation popes are for the church to be built upon.<a name=116:5></a> Roman Catholics cannot agree whether he was or was not a pope.<a name=116:6></a> When the Emperor let Pope Liberius back on his agreeing to communion with the Arians and signing an Arian or semi-Arian creed, Felix and he had to rub on together, two popes and two heads at a time, till Liberius died.<a name=116:7></a>

		As to Gregory Nazianzen, it proves, orator as he was, what I maintain; though in rhetorical language, without exactness, he says Peter is called a rock, which is not exact as to fact, for in the text Simon is called Peter, or a stone.<a name=116:8></a> But his explanation of it every Christian would allow, and it is what the Fathers often say, that the foundation of the church was trusted to his faith.<a name=116:9></a> No doubt it was, under God's grace.<a name=116:10></a> But, in this figurative sense, Paul also declares that he had laid the foundation, and that the church is built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ being the corner stone.<a name=116:11></a> So in the heavenly Jerusalem, the twelve foundations have the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.<a name=116:12></a> In this general way no reader of scripture could for a moment make any difficulty.<a name=116:13></a> But it proves that the popes can have nothing whatever to say to it.<a name=116:14></a> For since that foundation was once laid, all others, who have that blessed privilege, are built upon it.<a name=116:15></a> To lay the foundation of the church now is simply to deny it and its foundation as originally laid.<a name=116:16></a> It is perfectly clear that no pope nor any Christian in after times could have this place.<a name=116:17></a> Next as to Epiphanius.<a name=116:18></a>

		He does exalt Peter abundantly in the place quoted, and in the book on heresies also.<a name=117:1></a> In the former with much else, nearly as you say, "It became the first of the apostles, the solid rock on which the church should be built, and the gates of hell not prevail against it, by which gates the founders of heresies are meant.<a name=117:2></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here, however, I will add a passage farther on, from the same section 9 of the Anchoret:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"He (John) learning from the Son, and receiving from the Son, the power of knowledge; but he (Peter) obtained it from the Father, founding the security of faith.<a name=117:3></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the same Epiphanius says (Heresy of the Cathari (59) 7): -- "Upon this rock of a solid faith I will build my church.<a name=117:4></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here the faith is the rock.<a name=117:5></a> And note that, even in the passage in the Anchoret, the difference is founded on the immediate revelation by the Father, so that it applies only to Peter personally.<a name=117:6></a> Indeed, even where Peter is stated by the Fathers to be the rock, it is always on the ground of his personal faith.<a name=117:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Epiphanius therefore does not much help you out.<a name=117:8></a> It is Peter's faith one time, Peter himself another; but then because of the immediate revelation made to him by the Father.<a name=117:9></a> You next press Chrysostom on us; we will examine him too.<a name=117:10></a> You quote him on Matthew 55.<a name=117:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"The Lord says, 'Thou art Peter, and upon thee will I build my church.<a name=117:12></a>'"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is a very unfortunate quotation of Bellarmine's.<a name=117:13></a> Because in the Commentary on Matthew 55, Chrysostom says just the contrary: he is insisting on the special blessedness of Peter as having owned Christ to be the Son of the living God, and directly taught there the consubstantiality of the Son.<a name=117:14></a> And thereon says, "Therefore He adds this: Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church," that is, upon the faith of the confession.<a name=117:15></a> The Sermon on Pentecost, which is as strong as possible in the same sense, I do not quote, as the best editors consider it spurious.<a name=117:16></a> There it is said, "He did not say on Peter, referring to Petra, a rock, for He did not found His church on a man, but on faith.<a name=117:17></a>" At any rate, it is an ancient testimony.<a name=117:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"That in him as in a rock and most firm stone, he was going to build his church.<a name=118:3></a>" What I do find in Cyril nearest to this is "[Christ] most suitably from the rock changed his name to Peter (petra, petron), for he was about to found his church on him.<a name=118:4></a>" That is in Commentary on John 1 -- (Paris, 1638.<a name=118:5></a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But Cyril in his dialogue on the Trinity 4, vol.<a name=118:6></a> 2, page 1, 507, says on the verse, "Calling a rock, I think, by a change of word, nothing else, I think, but the immovable and firm faith of the disciples upon which, without possibility of falling, God has established and fixed the church of Christ.<a name=118:7></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have not thus made much progress with the Fathers yet.<a name=118:8></a> The Greek Fathers do some of them speak of Peter, but I have taken up those presented by you, and all but one say the contrary of your interpretation, though they, several of them, contradict themselves, which it is important enough for us to remark.<a name=118:9></a> We have not only Fathers against Fathers, but Fathers against themselves.<a name=118:10></a> This is a poor foundation for faith.<a name=118:11></a> The Council of Trent will not allow the consent of the Fathers to be rejected in interpretation; but we find no such consent, in most cases not even of one Father with himself.<a name=118:12></a>

		<i>N</i>.<a name=119:3></a> No doubt, but it is a proof that what he has pleaded as a security from falling is not a very solid one.<a name=119:4></a> Tertullian pleaded the prescription of the church, that is, tradition, as the grand security.<a name=119:5></a> He abandoned it all as carnal (physical).<a name=119:6></a> But I add it never was the authority of Rome on which he rested his case.<a name=119:7></a> Not only when a Montanist (de Pud.<a name=119:8></a>) he charges his adversaries with overturning the manifest purpose of Christ who conferred authority <i>personally</i> on Peter -- "I will give to <i>thee</i> .<a name=119:9></a>.<a name=119:10></a>.<a name=119:11></a>;" "whatsoever <i>thou</i> .<a name=119:12></a><i>.<a name=119:13></a>.<a name=119:14></a> "</i>; in which he is perfectly right; but in the book "de Praescriptione," and the passage so much relied upon, he makes doctrine the test.<a name=119:15></a> "In the same way they, the heretics, will be tested by these churches, which, though they can allege no apostle nor apostolic man as their founder, as having a much later origin, yet agreeing in the same faith, are accounted apostolic by reason of consanguinity of doctrine.<a name=119:16></a>" This we are quite ready to accept.<a name=119:17></a> Of Tertullian's system we have spoken.<a name=119:18></a> Strange to say, even this book is held by many learned men, Romanist and Protestant, to have been written when Tertullian had become a Montanist, as Dupin does on the one hand, and Allix on the other.<a name=119:19></a> Nor has he a thought in the treatise of setting up the authority of Rome.<a name=119:20></a> He insists that in Ephesus, Corinth, Philippi, Thessalonica, or Rome, you can trace up the doctrine to an apostolic source, and thus confute the heretics who have introduced new doctrines.<a name=119:21></a> Now we hold entirely that what was at <i>first</i> -- not early merely, but at first -- was right, and that only (see 1 John 2: 24).<a name=119:22></a> Therefore we condemn Rome which has innovated.<a name=119:23></a> But it is evident that an inspired epistle of an apostle is a better <i>evidence</i> of what the apostle taught than a tradition after the lapse of centuries of uninspired men.<a name=119:24></a> What was first was and is right.<a name=119:25></a> But the Epistles and other scriptures <i>are</i> what was first, and therefore we receive them only.<a name=119:26></a> To shew Tertullian's mind and how little he referred exclusively to Peter, I will quote another passage of his.<a name=119:27></a> The apostles were all sent forth, he says, after the Lord's resurrection, "and promulgated the same doctrine of the same faith to the nations, and then founded churches in each city, from which other churches have borrowed, and daily borrow, the descent of faith and seeds of doctrine, that they may become churches; and by this they also are accounted apostolic as offspring of apostolic churches.<a name=119:28></a> The whole race is necessarily referred to its own origin.<a name=119:29></a> Therefore so many and so great churches are that first one from the apostles from which all are.<a name=119:30></a> Thus all are the first and apostolic, while all prove unity together.<a name=119:31></a>" How far this is from having anything to do with Roman supremacy or Rome's being a security for truth, save as part of the whole, or Peter's being the one who ruled over all and secured truth, I need not say.<a name=119:32></a> It shuts out any such thought wholly.<a name=119:33></a> This was the common ground of those who pleaded prescription.<a name=119:34></a>

		I will complete the phrase.<a name=120:3></a> "But custom is not to be used as an authority, but one must be overcome by reasons.<a name=120:4></a> For neither did Peter, whom the Lord chose first and on whom He built His church, when Paul afterwards contended with him about circumcision, claim anything insolently to himself, or assume anything arrogantly, so as to say that he held any primacy.<a name=120:5></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is a strange passage to quote to prove Peter's primacy by; but, the truth is, Cyprian was the stern and successful resister of the commencing pretensions of Rome, and maintained an active correspondence with Asia Minor, Spain, and other parts to consolidate the whole episcopacy, for that was his system against any pretensions to a primacy.<a name=120:6></a> He expresses himself thus: "One episcopacy diffused in the accordant multitude of many bishops.<a name=120:7></a>" So with the whole synod of Carthage, speaking of the apostles, he says, "to whom we succeed, governing the church of God with the same power.<a name=120:8></a>" By no one, while acknowledging Peter as a centre of unity, is the equal power of bishops and their independency more stoutly maintained.<a name=120:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In his fifty-fifth letter he says, "The bond of concord remaining, and individual fidelity to the Catholic church maintained, each bishop disposes and directs his own acts, rendering an account to the Lord of his course.<a name=120:10></a>" And writing to the pope, to whom he never yielded, he says, "In which manner we neither do violence to any one, nor give the law, as each one who is set over [a church] is to have in the administration of the church the free judgment of his own will, having to render account of his conduct to God.<a name=120:11></a>" The history of what passed between him and popes in this respect we have referred to already.<a name=120:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Jerome does say so, and in a letter full of flattery and servility flies to Pope Damasus to know whether he is to say three hypostases or three persons; and he says, "I know that the church was built on that rock," that is, the See of Peter.<a name=121:3></a> And he says pretty much the same in his commentary on Isaiah, lib.<a name=121:4></a> 1, chapter 2, though he makes all the apostles mountains.<a name=121:5></a> But then on Amos, lib.<a name=121:6></a> 3, chapter 6, he says: "Christ is the rock who granted to His apostles that they should be also called rocks -- 'Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church.<a name=121:7></a>' Whoso is on these rocks, the adverse powers cannot pursue him.<a name=121:8></a>" And this application of it to all the apostles is common in the Fathers, as Ambrose and Augustine.<a name=121:9></a> So Jerome himself, in his violent letter against Jovinian, in favour of celibacy, says, "Thou sayest the church is founded on Peter, although the same in another place is so upon all the apostles, and all receive the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, and the stability of the church is established equally upon them.<a name=121:10></a>" Then it suited him to say so.<a name=121:11></a> He says that John was more loved of Christ and dared to ask when Peter did not; knew Him when Peter did not, etc.<a name=121:12></a>

		Augustine comes next.<a name=122:11></a> In his Psalm against the Donatists, a poor production -- poor in thought and morality -- which he says he wrote for the poorest that they might commit it to memory, and be able to meet them -- he presents Peter as the rock and a sure centre of unity to these poor people.<a name=122:12></a> He did the same (he tells us in his Retractations) in a book also against the Donatists, not now extant.<a name=122:13></a> Augustine is not happy in his spirit or reasonings with these Donatists.<a name=122:14></a> They had resisted one who had given up his Bible in the last persecutions, being a bishop.<a name=122:15></a> A vast number of bishops and their flocks sided with them, and the schism lasted a very long time, more than a century.<a name=122:16></a> The Catholics, as they call them, appealed not to the pope but to the Emperor, and the Donatists were cruelly persecuted and put to death.<a name=122:17></a> Their passions were roused, and many of them took arms and fought and used violence against the other party -- a wretched scene in the so-called Holy Catholic church.<a name=122:18></a> But so it was.<a name=122:19></a> Augustine cannot justify the party he espoused, but says there must be evil in the church, and the Donatists were worse.<a name=122:20></a> But he was every way embarrassed with these people.<a name=122:21></a> For, contrary to Cyprian and the East in earlier times, their baptism was held good.<a name=122:22></a> Now Augustine believed the Holy Ghost was conferred by baptism.<a name=122:23></a> They said to him, "Well, then, we confer the Holy Ghost, so we must have it.<a name=122:24></a>" Yet he said they were not in the unity of the Catholic church, and so had not got the Holy Ghost; and here he toils and labours, to get out of the net he had got himself into, so as to make any one pity him.<a name=122:25></a> But I must pass on, only it is well to keep in mind what this socalled Holy Catholic church was.<a name=122:26></a>

		Now hear the same Augustine when he is soberly seeking to edify souls in his sermons.<a name=123:1></a> In one of them we have an elaborate statement on the point, of which I can quote the kernel.<a name=123:2></a> It is on Matthew 14: 24 (or <i>de verbis Domini</i> 13 in some editions).<a name=123:3></a> He quotes the passage 16: 18, and says, "But this name that he should be called Peter was given him by the Lord; and this in such a figure as that he should signify the church, for Christ is the rock, Peter the Christian people, for rock (petra) is the principal name.<a name=123:4></a> Therefore it is Peter from petra (rock), not petra from Peter, as Christ is not from Christian, but Christian from Christ.<a name=123:5></a> 'Thou therefore,' says he, 'art Peter, and upon this rock which thou hast confessed, upon this rock which thou hast known, saying, <i>Thou</i> art, etc.<a name=123:6></a>, I will build my church,' that is, upon myself, the Son of the living God, I will build my church.<a name=123:7></a> I will build thee upon Me, not Me upon thee.<a name=123:8></a>" And again, "Thus they were baptized, not in the name of Paul, not in the name of Peter, but in the name of Christ, that Peter might be built upon the rock, not the rock upon Peter.<a name=123:9></a>" This is plain enough.<a name=123:10></a> Faith was at work, not controversy or servile theology.<a name=123:11></a>

		In his sermon on Pentecost (or <i>ex Sirmondianis</i> 22) he is equally plain.<a name=123:12></a> "For I am a rock, thou Peter .<a name=123:13></a>.<a name=123:14></a>.<a name=123:15></a> and upon this rock I will build my church, not upon Peter, which thou art, but upon the rock which thou hast confessed.<a name=123:16></a>" So in the sermon on Peter and Paul's day (ser.<a name=123:17></a> 295, or <i>de Diversis</i>, 108): "Upon this which thou hast said, 'Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God,' I will build my church.<a name=123:18></a> For thou art Peter, from petra (a rock), Peter, not the rock (petra) from Peter.<a name=123:19></a> Do you wish to know from what rock Peter is called?<a name=123:20></a> Hear Paul.<a name=123:21></a>" He then quotes 1 Corinthians 10: 1-4, ending "and that rock was Christ," as whence Peter comes.<a name=123:22></a> He goes on then to say, "These keys not one man but the unity of the church received," and quotes John 20: 22, 23, to shew that it was to the whole church to whom Peter was given, there to represent in its universality and unity, all the other apostles having then received it; and then Matthew 18: 15, 18, to shew that it applies to all the faithful saints, concluding "the dove binds, the dove looses, the building on the rock binds and looses.<a name=123:23></a>" His words are, "That you may know that Peter stood there as representing the whole church, hear what is said to herself, what to all the faithful saints.<a name=123:24></a>"

		Such was the teaching of Augustine.<a name=124:1></a> In his Retractations he mentions that in the lost book against the Donatists he had called Peter the rock (he refers to the psalm, but not to Peter's being named in it), and then says, "I know I have very often afterwards [he had written the book against the Donatists when only a presbyter] expounded it as meaning him whom Peter confessed; .<a name=124:2></a>.<a name=124:3></a>.<a name=124:4></a> for it was not said to him, Thou art a rock, but Thou art Peter, but the rock was Christ.<a name=124:5></a>" "Of these two opinions the reader may choose which is the more probable.<a name=124:6></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That makes a solid ground, by the consent of the Fathers, for your theme of Peter's being the rock.<a name=124:7></a> What I have cited proves two things, that is, that the Fathers generally contradict you, and that their authority is worth nothing, for they contradict themselves.<a name=124:8></a> No one taught of God would hesitate which to choose, the blessed Lord or Peter, for the rock on which the church or his own soul is to be built.<a name=124:9></a> It is evident that the Lord rests on the word, as Hilary and others say, of the blessed truth, that Jesus was the Son of the <i>living</i> God.<a name=124:10></a> Over what was founded on that he that had the power of death could not prevail.<a name=124:11></a> Nor will he.<a name=124:12></a> Happy those that are built on Him.<a name=124:13></a> But I will quote one more so-called father, because he was a pope, and an eminent one -- Gregory the Great.<a name=124:14></a> Of all the earlier popes, save Leo, he, while condemning the present papal claim of universal jurisdiction as the act of a forerunner of antichrist, most pushed on the papal power.<a name=124:15></a> Yet he says (lib.<a name=124:16></a> 31, 39, Job 97), "Where rock in the sacred language is used in the singular number, what else is understood but Christ, of which Paul is witness -- 'But the rock was Christ?<a name=124:17></a>'" In lib.<a name=124:18></a> 35: 42, 13 of the same book, he calls it the solidity of faith, of which solidity the Lord says, "On this rock I will build my church," and refers the whole thought to the incarnation.<a name=124:19></a>

That is to divide and make two Christs, he says. So in his first and second letters to Luciessus (v, page 2, 137, 143), after the union we do not divide the natures from one another. We do not cut the one and undivided into two sons, but we say one son, and, as the Fathers have said, one nature (phusin) of God the Word made flesh. Again, after union in an ineffable way, he shewed to us one nature of the Son, but, as I said, made flesh. And so very frequently. What was offensive in Nestorius was his saying that he could not say a child of two years old was God; but he excused this as said in the heat of argument, and urged that his words should not be insisted on. It was verbally at Ephesus. Cyril's statements are in elaborate treatises on doctrine. The Council of Chalcedon, though sanctioning the Council of Ephesus and Cyril by name, condemns (Actio Quinta) in *express terms* what in express terms Cyril taught, and what Nestorius and the Easterns objected to.

		<i>James</i>.<a name=169:3></a> Well, Bill, I should have liked to have heard it all; but if it is useful to you I am content, and my mind is at rest, and it might be curiosity on my part; for I see now that it is not the true doctrine of salvation they have, and the rest is not so much matter.<a name=169:4></a> They would save us by works and ordinances, and that is not God's way; and, after all, they do not know whether they are saved or not, and God never meant us to be in misery that way; and a man that has his conscience awakened, and judgment before him, must be miserable till he knows he is in God's favour -- till his conscience is purged, and he has peace with God; and scripture is as plain as can be as to that, just as plain as it is that we must lead a godly life.<a name=169:5></a> But there was a thing Mr.<a name=169:6></a> N.<a name=169:7></a> said to me which made plain where that came in, as plain as anything can be, only we have no sense really in the things of God till He teaches us.<a name=169:8></a> It was this, Bill: that a man's duties flow from the place he is already in; they cannot be the means of getting it, or they would not be duties.<a name=169:9></a> A man's child, or his servant, or his wife, has to obey and be dutiful because they are his child, and so on.<a name=169:10></a> What they are bound to do could not be their duty if they were not children, or servants, or wife.<a name=169:11></a> Now, if I am a child of God, as scripture speaks, and know I am one, that is the very reason I am bound to behave as a child.<a name=169:12></a> That is my duty, and cannot be my duty till I am one, and then we get strength as well as the duty.<a name=169:13></a> Scripture says, "Sin shall not have dominion over you; for ye are not under law, but under grace," and "My grace is sufficient for you.<a name=169:14></a>" So it is just when I know I am a child of God that my duty becomes clear.<a name=169:15></a>

		<i>James</i>.<a name=170:3></a> Nay, nay; but we <i>have</i> done what we liked, a deal too much, little else when we could; but on that ground we are lost.<a name=170:4></a> Christ came to seek and to save that which was lost.<a name=170:5></a> But I was answering what has been said -- that, if I know I am saved, I can go on as I like after; whereas, if I am saved, I am a child of God, and all my duties as a child of God just begin then.<a name=170:6></a> Instead of doing as I like, I am bound to walk, not merely as an honest man, but as a child of God, because I am one; and then that which is born of the Spirit is spirit, and delights in the things of God, though he may have to resist temptations from within and from without, and, if he is not watchful, he will fail.<a name=170:7></a> And then they that are after the Spirit mind the things of the Spirit.<a name=170:8></a> But I speak of duty.<a name=170:9></a>

		<i>Bill M</i>.<a name=170:10></a> Well, that is plain enough, that if we are in a place, the duties of the place belong to us, and we are bound to fulfil them.<a name=170:11></a> But, as for me, I want to know how to get into the place.<a name=170:12></a> Not that I understand well what it is, either; and I do not understand how you can be so sure of yourself.<a name=170:13></a>

Testimonia tua credibilia facta sunt nimis* [a bad translation of a bad translation, the Latin from the LXX]. But with those who admit the divine scriptures, and histories, and writings of the Fathers, they make them evidence of truth. For although the truth of articles of faith cannot be absolutely evident to us, yet it can be evident to us hypothetically, that is, the truth of the scripture being supposed." (De N. E., 4, 8.) Now, several things are to be noted here. First, the scriptures must be *first* believed before I have the truth of the church or any marks of it. Secondly, in order to confound all divine grounds of faith, the writings of the Fathers and histories are put upon a level with God's word. Thirdly, when we have the scriptures, the marks of the church are only known by inferences deduced. It is a very solemn thought that the Roman system has no divine foundation of faith, that is, in principle, it denies the direct claim of authority of God's word over the heart of man.

		<a class="footnote" name="#202:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>Far from it, it is a curious piece of Roman sign-making, and shews what these things are really worth. In Ribadeneyra, the disciple and companion of Ignatius himself, we find (lib. 5, 10, Mad. 1586, 335) a long proof in the objection that he did no miracles, that they were not to be sought as proofs. He quotes Gregory, saying the proof of sanctity is not in doing signs; quotes John 15, that disciples were to be known by love to one another; that John the Baptist did no sign; those (Matthew 7) whom He rejected do them. He cites Aug., quoting Matthew 24, Jerome on Matthew 7, 1 Corinthians 13, Augustine, Chrysostom, Gregory Naz., and Nyss. Athanasius wrought no miracles. Then he refers to 1 Corinthians 12; gifts were various. All these are reasons for Ignatius not doing any. Two hundred well-proved ones were produced for his beatification, as is stated by the Pere Bonhours. (Vide St. Ig., lib. 6, 3rd ed. page 540.) It is a striking thing that, whatever was the reason, Ignatius died without the sacraments. It is asserted that he died in terror. I dare say it is disputed, too, but certainly he died without the sacraments.

The Eastern Emperors attacked them, and, unhappily, they took arms, and for long years withstood the Greeks; but retreating into Persia, it seems they got infected with Manicheism, which joined with them in rejecting images and superstition. At last the Emperor made peace with them, and transported them to Bulgaria, as a check against the northern hordes. Thence they spread by Lombardy to Spain. There were two classes, the Albanenses and the Balioli. The former held two principles, a good and an evil one; the Balioli, not.

But it is plain that it was only the Romish sacrament as to it, which they denied; for their wives and widows are spoken of. (Elliott, Hor. Apoc., part 3, chapter 7.) Section 4 gives a pretty full account of all these revolters from Rome. As those who went to, and perished in, England were Germans, and were pronounced sound in faith as to Christ, probably those at Cologne, in Germany, and elsewhere, were also. But it is quite possible some, in breaking loose from the horrible iniquities and superstitions of Rome and Romanists, may have been misled in some points too by heresy. Evervinus letter is interesting; there is heart and conscience in it, though he saw them all burnt.

		<i>N</i>.<a name=219:19></a> Well, our next point is apostolicity and succession.<a name=219:20></a> To me it has no importance whatever.<a name=219:21></a> In the Spirit and word of God there can be no succession.<a name=219:22></a> They are themselves complete and perfect, and remain the same.<a name=219:23></a> Truth is itself; you cannot apply the idea of succession to it.<a name=219:24></a> That truth we have in God's written word.<a name=219:25></a> The word of God abides for ever.<a name=219:26></a> To talk of succession as to it is simple nonsense.<a name=219:27></a> They speak of succession as a means of securing the truth.<a name=219:28></a> But we have it in the word.<a name=219:29></a> It is very striking how the truth is never made a mark of the church by Roman Catholics.<a name=219:30></a> The scriptures are full of it.<a name=219:31></a> Christ is the truth; the Father's word is truth; we are sanctified by the truth; the apostle loved in the truth and for the truth's sake.<a name=219:32></a> If a preacher did not bring sound doctrine, even a woman was to judge him, and not receive him into her house nor bid him God speed.<a name=219:33></a> Souls are begotten to God by the truth.<a name=219:34></a> The truth sets free.<a name=219:35></a> But for the Roman Catholic system it is no mark of anything; for if the truth were a mark of the church, those who seek the church must have the truth first to judge of it by, before they have the church, and if the truth was really possessed by them, they then would be begotten of God and sanctified before they find the church.<a name=219:36></a> And so it was at the beginning; the truth was preached and received, and men thereupon entered into the church, because they had received it, if it was really savingly received; and this they do not deny when first preached to heathens and Jews.<a name=219:37></a>

		As to the use made by Irenaeus and others of this succession against heretics, though soon abused as a mere human argument as I have already said, I have no great objection to it.<a name=220:1></a> What was from the beginning is the truth; the surest way of finding it is reading what was at the beginning, which we confessedly have in the scripture; still as a mere external proof, if he could shew that no one had ever held it, and that it sprang up now in his own time, it might be used as an argument.<a name=220:2></a> Only it has this defect, that the carelessness of men may lose the discernment of many things in scripture, and truth may be brought up which really was at the beginning, and lost or somewhat enfeebled or even corrupted, so that to the men of the age it may seem new, when only reproduced from scripture.<a name=220:3></a> But when heretics said it was a bad God that made the Old Testament, as the heretics did, it might be honestly argued: No one from the beginning ever heard such a thing; and this is what Irenaeus did.<a name=220:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The scriptures were the surest appeal, and Irenaeus does appeal to them, only he shews he has not just confidence in using them in the power of the Spirit of God, and with Tertullian it is utterly so.<a name=220:5></a> He is just a lawyer, as he was, arguing a brief.<a name=220:6></a> And the result shews clearly the danger of leaving scripture; for what was at first used as a testimony soon came to be considered an authority, and then as more convenient for the corruptions of men, so that the scriptures were put out of sight.<a name=220:7></a>

		However, that was the use especially made of succession by those early writers.<a name=220:8></a> We will therefore examine the succession they plead, and see how far apostolicity in this respect will accredit their system.<a name=220:9></a> I take them on their own ground, not on mine; for grace and gift, I am perfectly assured, came directly from God, and not by succession.<a name=220:10></a> I examine it only as an alleged mark of the true church.<a name=220:11></a> They allege from early writers that the episcopal order can be traced up to the foundation of every see by apostles and apostolic men, or afterwards through them in places subsequently founded, and in particular the succession of Rome to Peter; for poor Paul is nowadays pretty much thrown overboard: his teaching does not suit Rome.<a name=220:12></a>

		First, remark that the word "bishops" in the word of God does not mean what it does now.<a name=221:19></a> There were bishops and deacons in the church at Philippi; there were bishops in the church of Ephesus, called also elders of the church.<a name=221:20></a> You have "overseers" in the English version, of Acts 20: 28, for bishops, which is indeed the meaning of the word.<a name=221:21></a> This is equally plain in Timothy and Titus; so in Acts 14.<a name=221:22></a> The apostle chose them for every city.<a name=221:23></a> There is no one stationary president of any church in the New Testament, unless we take James at Jerusalem to be such; but then he presides over apostles, which is an awkward position for a bishop.<a name=221:24></a> I know Timothy and Titus are alleged to be such.<a name=221:25></a> That they were on certain occasions entrusted by the apostles with the care of one or several churches is true, but we do not find them in the scripture locally resident as such anywhere.<a name=221:26></a> They were at the apostles' service elsewhere afterwards, as need called for it, according to Christ's will.<a name=221:27></a> All this is uncontested and incontestable.<a name=221:28></a> Tradition localized them afterwards; scripture does not.<a name=221:29></a> That very soon indeed there were local presidents, who very early got the name of bishops, I do not contest; but the origin of this lies historically buried in the most absolute obscurity.<a name=221:30></a>

	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#222:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>In this same chapter of the treatise (contra Marc.) we have the false point of Tertullian, prescription, which thus wholly breaks down. If what is earlier is truer, if what is earlier is from the beginning, what is from the beginning is from the apostles; and this assumes not that what was *from the beginning* is true, as the apostle John states it (which we have in the scriptures of the New Testament), but what is earlier is truer, which has no force at all, and is the basis of the whole, because it does not go to the beginning, and often is not true. Unless his assertion, "what is earlier is from the beginning," be accepted as necessarily true -- and this assertion is utterly groundless -- clearly a thing may be earlier than another, yet not from the beginning.

		As to the second point, it is a presumptuous charge against the apostles and other servants of the Lord, for they addressed themselves to the people (what you call the laity in the church) and indeed it is charging God with folly, for it was by inspiration that the apostle and others addressed their writings to all the church.<a name=224:12></a> But these points we have considered already.<a name=224:13></a>

		Let us see what tradition tells us here, for history is all we can have -- statements made long after what men had heard.<a name=236:1></a> Theodoret (Dial.<a name=236:2></a> 1, vol.<a name=236:3></a> 4, 33; Harris, 642), and Chrysostom say that Ignatius was ordained by Peter.<a name=236:4></a> Athanasius calls him the first after the apostles (De Synodis, 1, 607; Ben.<a name=236:5></a> ed.<a name=236:6></a> Pat.<a name=236:7></a>); Origen calls him second after Peter (Hom.<a name=236:8></a> 6, in Luc.<a name=236:9></a>); Jerome says he was the third (Cap.<a name=236:10></a> Script.<a name=236:11></a>).<a name=236:12></a> Now, in the first place, these statements, if to be reconciled, shew that neither Evodias nor Ignatius were successors of Peter, for he was alive during both their lives, and, if the statement be true, Evodias died before Peter did.<a name=236:13></a> Indeed Bellarmine, though he makes Peter the first bishop of Rome, admits that the apostles, as such, had no successors (De Sum.<a name=236:14></a> Pont.<a name=236:15></a> 4, 25).<a name=236:16></a> The pope, he says, succeeds to him as ordinary pastor of the whole church, the bishops not -- as to them, the apostles having only an extraordinary place.<a name=236:17></a> According to him, Christ ordained Peter, or we should have no episcopate at all; he, James and John, and they, the rest; and so they were all bishops.<a name=236:18></a><a href="#236:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> Still he makes Peter, James, and John ordain James after the Lord's death.<a name=236:19></a> Thus, at Antioch, one Father says Ignatius was first after the apostles, another that he was the second, another that he was the third.<a name=236:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is hard to be reconciled, and to mean the same thing.<a name=236:21></a> One says that he was the first bishop after the apostle was gone.<a name=236:22></a> Another counts him second, that is, after Evodias, not reckoning the apostle Peter at all.<a name=236:23></a> Another, counting Peter in, makes him third.<a name=236:24></a> But then here come the Apostolic Constitutions, and Baronius, the great Catholic historian, approves seemingly their views of the case (Bar.<a name=236:25></a> 12, 45), that Evodias was named by Paul, Ignatius by Peter for the Jewish Christians.<a name=236:26></a> So that there were two bishops and the unity of the church gone, and the fruit of the settlement and decrees of the apostles wholly lost, Paul and Peter acting in contradiction to the object of them.<a name=236:27></a> Then they suppose that Ignatius gave way to Evodias when matters were settled, and, when Evodias died, Ignatius came in, and was bishop by himself.<a name=236:28></a>

		Tradition, on the other hand, in the only two cases where any details are given, proves, through the uncertainty that surrounds them, that there was no such appointment known, though, as centuries rolled by, and the system prevailed, they traced it up to the names best known at the first.<a name=239:1></a> Thus Irenaeus goes up to Polycarp at Smyrna.<a name=239:2></a> But Polycarp writes as one among the presbyters in his letter to the Philippians; "Polycarp and the presbyters with him," and afterwards, at the end of Section 5 and the beginning of Section 6, knows only presbyters and deacons.<a name=239:3></a> Perhaps the first positive recognition of it is in Ignatius' letter to Polycarp as it stands in the Syriac version.<a name=239:4></a> And this was in Trajan's time, in the year 116, at which time nobody doubts that one presiding prelate existed.<a name=239:5></a> Yet even he (3, 22) speaks of the succession of presbyters.<a name=239:6></a> As to Polycarp himself, Tertullian says he was put into the office by John, referring to no one before him (De page Har.<a name=239:7></a> 32): Irenaeus, 3, 3, says he had seen him young ordained by the apostles; so Jerome (De Viris Illustribus), that he was a disciple of John, and made bishop of Smyrna by him.<a name=239:8></a> But in the Apostolic Constitutions we have three bishops, and no Polycarp -- Aristo, Stratias, and Aristo (7, 46).<a name=239:9></a> But Cotelerius tells us that those celebrated are Bucolus first, and then Polycarp.<a name=239:10></a> Irenaeus knows nothing of Bucolus, but, as Polycarp knew John, and he knew Polycarp, traces the certainty through what they taught, that the church had never held that the world was created by another and evil god, who had also given the law; for this was the subject of Irenaeus' controversy.<a name=239:11></a>

		A little farther on in our history we arrive at still greater confusion.<a name=264:1></a> At the death of Paul, a Tuscan noble brought his brother Constantine to Rome, and forced a bishop to consecrate him, and he was pope for more than a year, and his election and consecration as pope confirmed by a council.<a name=264:2></a> He ordained clergy and consecrated eight bishops.<a name=264:3></a> But one of the Roman court, Christophle, went (swearing to Constantine that he would not do it, and perjuring himself) and by treachery brought forces into Rome to drive out the pope.<a name=264:4></a> But while this was going on, Constantine, having hid himself, one Philip was taken and consecrated pope.<a name=264:5></a> However, Christophle made his way in, and Pope Philip swore that he would not leave Rome till he had been driven out, which was done, and he quietly retired to a monastery.<a name=264:6></a> They deposed Constantine, and then elected and consecrated a third pope, Stephen; and Christophle's son went and got Charles, called Charlemagne, and Carloman, Pepin being dead, to send French prelates to Rome to set things in order.<a name=264:7></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#268:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>The authorities are cited -- too long to go through here -- in Jewel's answer to Harding (5, 351, Kele's edition), Basnage (Hist. de l'Eglise, 408 ff.). These authors are Protestants, but the books they cite from are not. So L'Enfant's translation of Spanheim. Those who read German can consult Schroek, who does not think it proved. All authorities are quoted. It is difficult to deal with Anastasius, in the same century, states it; but it is said to be interpolated, and there is a long history as to this, and Jesuit frauds connected with it. It is in Marianus Scotus. Here again it is said the best manuscripts have it not, but Baronius admits he has the story. He was in the eleventh century. Martinus Polonus has the whole story in full in 1278. These are two renowned Roman Catholic writers. But interpolations are charged, as the taking out in editions is insisted on too. That it was then universally accredited is evident. And who should have put it into so many grave Roman Catholic writers? The strongest proof against it is Hincmar's letter to Nicolaus I in 866, which was sent to Leo IV and found Benedict there, but this is sought to be avoided. However, having given a short view of the question, for there is a vast deal more said, I leave the matter where it is.

		We have still a little farther to go to make the matter plainer if possible.<a name=278:6></a> "It is evident," says Baronius 900, 3), "no one could scarcely believe, nor is it indeed scarcely to be believed, unless one had himself seen it with his eyes, and handled it with his hands, what shocking and what base and hideous and execrable and abominable things the holy apostolic see was compelled to undergo, on which the whole Catholic church turns as on a hinge.<a name=278:7></a>" This he attributes to princes meddling with it.<a name=278:8></a> But it was, remember, in the popes that sat on the see these things were found, and this dark state of things lasted and characterized, as Baronius states at the beginning of it, the whole century, till they called in a powerful Emperor, Otho, to set it to rights, swore fealty to him, got him to name a pope, and then rebelled against him.<a name=278:9></a> It had become hopelessly intolerable.<a name=278:10></a> It was partly, not all, the consequence of the interference of the Marquis of Tuscany and his family.<a name=278:11></a>

		THE TESTIMONY OF GOD; OR THE TRIAL OF MAN, THE GRACE AND THE GOVERNMENT OF GOD
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nothing, unless it be personal salvation and the communion of the soul with our God, can be of greater importance, or of higher interest for the Christian, than the testimony which God has given to Himself in this world of darkness.<a name=335:1></a> After all, salvation and communion depend on this testimony.<a name=335:2></a> What would the state of man be without this testimony?<a name=335:3></a> What is his state where this testimony has not penetrated?<a name=335:4></a> What an immense privilege to possess the thoughts of God Himself, above all with regard to that which concerns us morally, to be in relationship with God through means of the communication of His thoughts, to be called His friends and to enjoy this privilege as a matter of fact by the possession of the truest, the most intimate, testimonies of His thoughts and His affections!<a name=335:5></a> And observe that, man being the great object of His affections, these develop themselves in the ways of God with regard to man -- ways which even the angels desire to look into.<a name=335:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In fact man, according to the wisdom of God, is the being with regard to whom the character of God and all His moral ways unfold themselves most completely and in the most perfect and admirable way.<a name=335:7></a> It is not, by any means, the intellectual capacity of man, nor his moral power which renders him so fit for this, because it is not the judgment which he can form of what God is that is capable of revealing God-without even taking into account the fall of man.<a name=335:8></a> This judgment would always, by the fact that man is an imperfect and feeble creature, be below the truth with regard to God, in the proportion in which man is below God.<a name=335:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Moreover innocent man would have neither the need, nor the desire, to pass a judgment about God.<a name=335:10></a> He would enjoy His goodness with thanksgiving.<a name=335:11></a> Man who is a sinner is in no way capable of judging rightly, either of his state, or of his position before God; he has not even the wish for it.<a name=335:12></a> No, God reveals Himself in His own ways with regard to man.<a name=335:13></a> An angel does not furnish Him the occasion for it as man does; an angel has no need of mercy, of grace, of forgiveness, of divine righteousness, of a sacrificing priest, of power which, while sustaining him in weakness, raises him up from the dead.<a name=335:14></a> An angel is not, following upon all these things, made like to Christ, the glorious man, identified with His interests by the incarnation.<a name=335:15></a> Angels are a witness rendered to the creative and preserving power of God.<a name=335:16></a> They excel in strength.<a name=335:17></a> We see in them creatures kept by God, so that they have not lost their first estate.<a name=335:18></a> Now, grace and redemption, patience, mercy, divine righteousness, do not apply to such a state, but to fallen man they do.<a name=335:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=336>[Page 336]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here the angels desire to fathom the wonderful ways of God with regard to man.<a name=336:1></a> It is from the heart of man, descended to the lowest step in the scale of intelligent beings, resembling alas!<a name=336:2></a> the beasts in his desires.<a name=336:3></a> Satan in his pride, a weak slave in his passions; strong, or at least proud, in his spirit and in his pretensions; having the knowledge of good and evil, but in a conscience which condemns him; by reason of sufferings, sighing after something better but incapable of attaining it; having the want of some other world than this material one, but fearful of getting to it; having the feeling that we ought to be in relationship with God, the only object worthy of an immortal soul, but at an infinite distance from God in his lusts, and animated by such a desire for independence that he is unwilling to admit God to the only place which becomes Him if He is God, and seeks consequently to prove that there is no God; it is from the heart of man, capable of the highest aspirations, with which his pride feeds itself, and of the most degrading lusts with which however his conscience becomes disgusted; it is from the heart of man, that God forms the divine harp on which all the harmony of His praises can resound and will resound for evermore.<a name=336:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		By the bringing in of grace and the divine power which unfolds itself in a new life communicated to man, and by the manifestation of the Son of God in human nature, fallen man is brought to judge all evil, according to divine affections formed in him by faith, and to enjoy good according to the perfect revelation of good in God Himself manifested in Christ; while man gives God His place with joy, because He is known as a God of love.<a name=336:5></a> Man also takes again the place of dependence -- the only one which is suitable for a creature; but of a dependence which is exercised in the intelligence of all the perfections of God, on which he depends, and depends with joy, as a child on his father, like Christ Himself who has taken this place in order that we may enter into it.<a name=336:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=337>[Page 337]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in order that the character of God, that which He is, may be unfolded in the state of man, and that our hearts and consciences may take knowledge of it, man must pass through the different phases which furnish occasion for God to unfold Himself thus in grace.<a name=337:1></a> He must be, on God's part, an innocent and happy creature, by his own will fallen and guilty, and in a state in which all the grace of God displays itself, and in which God unfolds all its riches and righteousness, while His sovereign good-pleasure raises man to a height which depends wholly on this good-pleasure and glorifies God Himself in the result which is produced but glorifies a God of love.<a name=337:2></a> In result, His sovereign goodness is displayed towards the most perfect misery, and causes to enter into its communion the most perfect excellence.<a name=337:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are about to examine briefly these ways of God toward man.<a name=337:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God created man innocent, that is to say, having neither malice nor corruption nor lust, and without the discernment of good and evil -- a discernment he had no need of, for he had only to enjoy with gratitude the good with which he was surrounded.<a name=337:5></a> At the same time he was bound to obey, and his obedience was put to the proof by his being forbidden to eat one tree alone which was found in the midst of the garden.<a name=337:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It has been supposed that he had the knowledge of good and that he acquired the knowledge of evil.<a name=337:7></a> To say so is to misunderstand the force of the expression.<a name=337:8></a> He acquired the knowledge of the distinction of good and evil in himself.<a name=337:9></a> He began to judge concerning that which is good and that which is evil.<a name=337:10></a> Eating of the forbidden fruit was only evil because it was forbidden to be eaten, it was not evil in itself.<a name=337:11></a> God has taken care that, in a state of sin, conscience should accompany man.<a name=337:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Man would have had opportunity, while in a state of innocence, to enjoy the visits of God, and to hold intercourse with God; but God did not dwell with him, nor he with God.<a name=337:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Man did not fall without being tempted.<a name=337:14></a> The enemy suggested to his mind distrust with regard to God; and this distrust, separating his heart from God, gave place to his own will and his lust, as well as to the pride which would be equal with God.<a name=337:15></a> Now self-will, lust, and pride are what mark the actual condition of the natural man.<a name=337:16></a> Thus man separated himself from God in making himself, as far as his will was concerned, independent of Him, that is to say, as much as sin can make independent, and as moral degradation does make us independent of sovereign good.<a name=337:17></a> In this state man could not endure the presence of God.<a name=337:18></a> On the contrary, that presence, which cast the divine light on the state of man and made him feel what he had become -- that presence which recalled his fault to him and what he had lost, must have been to him of all things the most intolerable.<a name=337:19></a> Man might cover himself to his own eyes from the shame of sin, but before God he knew that he was naked, as if not a fig-leaf had been found in the garden.<a name=337:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=338>[Page 338]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The question of God, "Adam, where art thou?<a name=338:1></a>" was equally touching and overwhelming.<a name=338:2></a> Why, when he heard the voice of God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, with the divine familiarity of a goodness which could enter into communication with an innocent nature, did not man run to meet Him?<a name=338:3></a> Where was he?<a name=338:4></a> In sin and in nakedness.<a name=338:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the word of God lays man bare.<a name=338:6></a> Terrible truth when the conscience is bad!<a name=338:7></a> -- truth before which all pretence to independence vanishes like falsehood before the truth, only leaving the shameful guilt of the pretence itself, as well as of the folly and ingratitude which have sought after this independence, and in which we have sought to be independent of supreme good.<a name=338:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Observe here that the promise was made to the last Adam, to the Seed of the woman, and that it goes before the expulsion of fallen Adam from the earthly paradise.<a name=338:9></a> Thus man fled from the presence of God before God drove him from the peaceful abode in which He had placed him.<a name=338:10></a> But the authority of God must be maintained.<a name=338:11></a> It was not becoming that sin should remain unpunished.<a name=338:12></a> Judgment must needs be put in exercise.<a name=338:13></a> The holiness of God abhors sin and repels it.<a name=338:14></a> The righteousness of God maintains His authority according to His holiness in executing a just judgment on him who does evil.<a name=338:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Man was banished from paradise, and <i>the world began</i>.<a name=338:16></a> Sin against one's neighbour was consummated in the world, as sin against God in paradise, and the death of the righteous one presented a striking image of that of the Lord Himself.<a name=338:17></a> Driven from the presence of God, man in despair sought to put in order and to embellish the world: this was all that remained to him; and civilization, the arts, and the delights of a life of luxury occupied and developed the intelligence of a being, who, having no longer any relation with holiness and the divine perfections, lost himself in that which was below him, while boasting himself of the fruits of his perverted intellect.<a name=338:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=339>[Page 339]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, without the repression of the will of man by a superior power, civilization, although it may deceive for a moment the judgment of man as to the state of his heart in occupying the mind, cannot arrest the vehemence of lusts, nor the violence of the will which seeks to satisfy them and to make a way for its passions through all obstacles.<a name=339:1></a> "The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.<a name=339:2></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the grace of God did not leave itself without witness.<a name=339:3></a> The judgment of God on the serpent announced the Seed of the woman.<a name=339:4></a> Abel, who "being dead yet speaketh," testified of the power of evil and of Satan in the world; but he also testified of the acceptance on God's part of the righteous one who comes to God through a sacrifice which recognizes sin and atones for it, and lays the foundation of a hope outside the world in which the one who was accepted of God had been rejected and sacrificed to the hatred of the wicked.<a name=339:5></a> The departure of Enoch, who walked with God, confirmed this hope, and tended to assure faith (which believes that God is, and that He is the rewarder of them that diligently seek him) that there is a happiness for the righteous in the presence of Him whom he loves -- a happiness which the world does not give, neither does it take away.<a name=339:6></a> This, although obscure, nourished and sustained the faith of those who sought to walk with God, whilst evil went on always increasing.<a name=339:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When the evil was approaching its height, another testimony was raised up in the person of him who was to pass through the judgment which put an end to the frightful development of evil that prevailed in spite of the testimony already given.<a name=339:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This was a testimony, not for the affections of the saints, fitted to carry them outside the world, but a testimony of the judgment of the world itself -- a judgment necessary according to the principles of divine government, but through which a small righteous remnant should be preserved in an ark of safety which God revealed to them.<a name=339:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such was the condition of man, such his history, when, in consequence of the violation of a law, he had been driven from the earthly paradise in which God had placed him, and left, without law, to his own will, though not without a testimony.<a name=339:10></a> It needed that the deluge should put an end to a state of things in which corruption and violence had covered the face of the earth and left only eight persons disposed to listen to the testimony that God granted to them of the judgment which awaited them.<a name=339:11></a>

		During the period which transpired between the expulsion of Adam from the terrestrial paradise and the deluge, man was one family, one race.<a name=340:1></a> There was no idolatry.<a name=340:2></a> Man was left to his own ways (not without witness, but without restraint from without), and the evil became insupportable: the deluge put an end to it.<a name=340:3></a> After this event -- this judgment of God, a new world began, and the principle of government was introduced.<a name=340:4></a> He who should kill a man should himself be put to death: a curb was put upon violence, a bridle on outward sin.<a name=340:5></a> The corruption of the heart in a world at a distance from God remained just as it was.<a name=340:6></a> But although there were as yet no nations, the destiny of various races, such as it has been to the present day, began to dawn at least prophetically.<a name=340:7></a> Noah failed in the position in which he had been placed after the deluge, as Adam had failed in paradise, as man has always done; as every creature has done which has not been directly sustained of God.<a name=340:8></a>

		Two great principles, which subsist to the present day, characterize the world which is developed after Noah: they are connected with the tower of Babel.<a name=340:10></a> Up to this time, whether before or after the deluge, there had been only the human race, one family only.<a name=340:11></a> Now, in consequence of the judgment of man, who seeks to exalt himself on the earth and to make himself a name or centre which may give him strength, God scatters those who were building the tower, and there are nations, languages, and peoples.<a name=340:12></a> The actual form of the world was established in reference to its division into different tribes and different nations.<a name=340:13></a> Moreover individual energy forms an empire which has Babel for its centre and point of departure.<a name=340:14></a> Now that the world is constituted, we arrive at the testimony and ways of God.<a name=340:15></a> In the midst of this system of nations, there were languages, peoples, and nations.<a name=340:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The judgment of God had thus ordered the world, but an immense fact appears in the history of the world.<a name=340:17></a> The sin of man is no longer only sin against God, manifested in corruption and in the activity of an independent will.<a name=340:18></a> Demons take the place of God Himself in the eyes and for the imagination of men.<a name=340:19></a> Idolatry reigns among the nations, and even in the race brought the nearest to God, the race of Shem.<a name=340:20></a> Although, at bottom, this idolatry was everywhere the same, each nation had its gods.<a name=340:21></a> The system established by God Himself, at the time of the judgment of the race at the tower of Babel, acknowledged demons as its gods.<a name=340:22></a> This gives occasion to the call of Abraham.<a name=340:23></a> The God of glory appears to him and calls him to leave his country, his kindred, and his father's house.<a name=340:24></a> He must break completely with the system established by God; and that in its most intimate relationships.<a name=340:25></a> He must be for God, and for God alone.<a name=340:26></a> He is chosen by sovereign grace; being called, he walks by faith, and the promises are made to him.<a name=340:27></a>

		But this call introduces another principle of great importance.<a name=341:1></a> There had already been many faithful ones who had walked with God -- Abels, Enochs, Noahs; but none was like Adam, who was head of evil, the stock of a race.<a name=341:2></a> Now Abraham, being called, became the stock of a race which was to inherit the promises outside the world.<a name=341:3></a> Of course this may be developed in a spiritual manner in Christians, or in a carnal manner in the people of Israel; but the heir of the promise (and this applies to Christ Himself) enjoys it as the seed of Abraham.<a name=341:4></a> If the nations, the peoples, the families, and the languages took demons for their gods, God took a man by His grace to be the head of a family, the stock of a people, who may belong to Him for His own.<a name=341:5></a> The fatness of God's olive-tree is found in those who grow on the root of Abraham, whether it be in a people, the seed according to the flesh, or in a seed which shares in the promised blessings, inasmuch as belonging to Christ the true Seed of the promise.<a name=341:6></a> This call and this vocation, whatever the phases may be which the objects to which they apply pass through, always remain firm.<a name=341:7></a> Christ Himself came to accomplish the promises made to the fathers, as a witness of the unchangeable truth of God.<a name=341:8></a>

		This state of the people of God brings in an event in which a principle of immense importance is brought into view, namely, that of redemption, or of the deliverance of the people of God from the consequences of sin and from the slavery in which they were held.<a name=342:1></a> We shall see also, in the fruits of redemption, facts of the highest interest for us.<a name=342:2></a> The cry of the people went up to the ears of Jehovah of Hosts, and He comes down to deliver them.<a name=342:3></a> But the Saviour is the just Judge, and it is needful that He should reconcile these two characters.<a name=342:4></a> In order to be able to deliver, His own righteousness must be satisfied.<a name=342:5></a> A God who is not righteous cannot, morally speaking, be a Saviour.<a name=342:6></a> It is in this character that God definitely appears, when He intends to deliver the people.<a name=342:7></a> He had manifested His power in calling on Pharaoh to let the people go, in declaring the rights he had over Israel; but the deliverance must needs be accomplished without the goodwill of man and by the judgment of God, by the full manifestation of what He is with regard to evil, and in love also, so that He may be known.<a name=342:8></a> Now the people themselves were, in certain respects, more guilty than the Egyptians; and God comes in as a judge.<a name=342:9></a> But the blood of the paschal lamb is put upon the door, and Israel escapes the judgment that was due to them, according to the value which that blood had in the eyes of God.<a name=342:10></a> God judges, and, by reason of the blood recognized by faith, passes over His guilty people.<a name=342:11></a> But Israel was still in Egypt; their deliverance was not yet effected, although the price of redemption was paid in figure.<a name=342:12></a> Israel sets forth.<a name=342:13></a> On arriving at the Red Sea, the question of their deliverance or their ruin must be decided.<a name=342:14></a> Pharaoh had pursued them, sure of his victory.<a name=342:15></a> The wilderness in which Israel was, in appearance, lost, offered them no outlet; and the Red Sea (figure of death and judgment) was straight before them.<a name=342:16></a> On the morrow Israel only saw the corpses of their enemies who had perished in the sea -- the road of salvation for the people of God.<a name=342:17></a> The death and judgment of Christ make us pass on dry land, far away from the place where we were captives.<a name=342:18></a>

		We have, in this important history, the figures of the great facts on which our eternal blessing is founded.<a name=342:22></a> It prefigures propitiation, redemption, and justification under a double aspect; on the one hand, propitiation by the blood which sets us free from all imputation of sin in presence of the righteousness of God; and on the other, our introduction, in virtue of the value of that blood, into an altogether new position by the resurrection.<a name=342:23></a> Christ was delivered for our offences and raised again for our justification.<a name=342:24></a>

		Some very important principles come before our eyes, consequent upon deliverance by redemption.<a name=343:1></a> God <i>dwells</i> with the redeemed -- if you will, in their midst.<a name=343:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He did not dwell with innocent Adam, nor with Abraham called by His grace and heir of the promises.<a name=343:3></a> But, as soon as Israel is redeemed and delivered by redemption, God dwells in the midst of the people.<a name=343:4></a> Compare Exodus 15: 2, and chapter 29: 45, 46.<a name=343:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The holiness of God and of the relations of His people with Him then appear for the first time.<a name=343:6></a> Never in Genesis was the holiness of anything whatever set before us (except in the alone case of the sanctification of the sabbath in paradise), nor the holiness of God's character.<a name=343:7></a> But Exodus 15 and 19; Leviticus 19: 26, and other passages shew us that, once redemption is accomplished, God takes this character, and establishes it as necessary for everything that is in relation with Himself.<a name=343:8></a> Compare Exodus 6: 5.<a name=343:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In immediate connection with this truth another is found, which, moreover, flows necessarily from redemption, namely, that the ransomed ones no longer belong to themselves; they are taken for God, consecrated to God, set apart for Him.<a name=343:10></a> Afterwards they are brought to God Himself; Exodus 19: 4.<a name=343:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Israel enter into the wilderness, the character of this world for the people of God who have the consciousness of their redemption, and the faithfulness of God takes care of His people there.<a name=343:12></a> Next, they enter into Canaan, where it is a question of the victories which we must win in order to enjoy in this world the heavenly privileges which belong to us.<a name=343:13></a> As to the title, we enjoy these privileges before gaining a single victory; but, in order to realize these privileges, we must conquer.<a name=343:14></a> The wilderness and Canaan prefigure the two parts of Christian life: patience in the world under the hand of God who is leading us; and victory in our combats with Satan, in order to enjoy and to cause others to enjoy spiritual privileges.<a name=343:15></a>

		But another very important privilege comes to light during the sojourn of Israel in the wilderness.<a name=344:1></a> If the reader examines Exodus 15 to 18, he will find that all is grace.<a name=344:2></a> But in chapter 19 the people put themselves under the law, and accept the enjoyment of the promises under the condition of their own obedience to all that Jehovah would say.<a name=344:3></a> Obedience was a duty; but to place themselves under this condition was to forget their own weakness and to ensure their being lost, a consequence which did not fail.<a name=344:4></a> Before Moses came down from the mountain, Israel had made the calf of gold.<a name=344:5></a> The patience of God continued His relations with the people by the means of the intercession of Moses, until, as Jeremiah says, there was no longer any remedy.<a name=344:6></a> But our aim now is to point out the ways of God, and not to enter into details.<a name=344:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The promises of God had been made to Abraham without condition, and in consequence the question of righteousness had not been raised.<a name=344:8></a> Now this question was raised, and first, as was reasonable, righteousness in man demanded on God's part.<a name=344:9></a> It was the duty of the creature.<a name=344:10></a> The question must needs have been raised, but the result was -- and with sinners it could be no other -- that man, having violated the law, aggravated his sin, instead of attaining to righteousness.<a name=344:11></a> With a rule which would have made his happiness if he had kept it, he is only a transgressor and by so much the more guilty before God.<a name=344:12></a> Moreover, it was in order to convince him of his state of sin that the law, which brought in positive transgressions, was given to him.<a name=344:13></a> God never had the thought of saving by a law; and man needs to be saved.<a name=344:14></a> The law of God must propose a rule which expresses the perfection of a man, nay, of every intelligent creature.<a name=344:15></a> But that could do nothing else than make sin evident, when man was already a sinner.<a name=344:16></a> This last truth is forgotten, when people speak of the law.<a name=344:17></a> However the law of God must be the perfect expression of what man ought to be, that is to say, must condemn man, a sinner.<a name=344:18></a> An exact measure does not add anything to a too short piece of cloth which has been sold to me, but it manifests the fraud.<a name=344:19></a> "By the law is the knowledge of sin.<a name=344:20></a>" The question of human righteousness has been resolved by the law.<a name=344:21></a> Ordained with promise of life for obedience, it has been in fact a ministry of death and condemnation for those who have borne its yoke.<a name=344:22></a>

		When man fell, the Seed of the woman, the last Adam, was immediately announced: the hopes of the human race are thenceforth placed upon a new ground.<a name=346:1></a> The deliverance presented does not consist in something which would have been but a means of raising up again founded on the moral activity of man already in a fallen condition; but another person is announced, who, while of the human race, should be a source of life independent of Adam, and who should destroy the power of the enemy; a person who should not represent Adam, but replace him before God, should be the seed of the woman, which Adam was not, and should at the same time be an object of faith for Adam and for his children -- an object which, being received into the heart, should be the life and salvation of whoever should receive it.<a name=346:2></a> The first Adam was made a living soul; he was lost: the last Adam, the second Man, is a quickening spirit.<a name=346:3></a> Until the coming of Christ the promise only was the source of hope; it alone, through grace, begat and sustained faith.<a name=346:4></a> We believe in its accomplishment.<a name=346:5></a> When God called Abraham, He gave him (Genesis 12) the promise that in him all the nations of the earth should be blessed.<a name=346:6></a> Afterwards (chapter 22) this promise was confirmed to his Seed.<a name=346:7></a> The one who was to be the seed of the woman was also to be the seed of Abraham.<a name=346:8></a> Thus the ways of God towards man were established on an indefectible promise.<a name=346:9></a> It was without condition, a simple promise, and consequently it did not raise the question of righteousness nor of the responsibility of man.<a name=346:10></a>

		Four hundred and thirty years afterwards the law comes, and, as we have said, raises the question of righteousness, and that, on the footing of the responsibility of man, by giving him a perfect rule of what man, the child of Adam, ought to be.<a name=346:11></a> Now, observe it well, he was a sinner.<a name=346:12></a> This law had a twofold aspect, a kernel of absolute truth, which the Lord Jesus was able to draw from its obscurity -- supreme love to God and love to one's neighbour.<a name=346:13></a> It is the perfect rule of the blessedness of the creature as a creature.<a name=346:14></a> The angels realize it in heaven.<a name=346:15></a> Man is as far as possible from having accomplished the law on earth.<a name=346:16></a> But this rule is developed in the details of relative duties, which flow from the relation in which man finds himself, as a fact, before God, and from the relation in which he finds himself placed as towards others in this lower world.<a name=346:17></a>

		There is the history of man under the law.<a name=349:12></a> If we examine the bearing of the law on the conscience, we shall find that it brings condemnation and death as soon as it is spiritually understood; but the aim of this article is to consider the ways of God.<a name=349:13></a> Nevertheless I cannot leave this subject without entreating my reader to weigh well what is the bearing of the law, if it be applied to his conscience and his life before God, if he be responsible -- and he surely is -- if all he can do is to recognize the justice and excellence of that which the law demands.<a name=349:14></a> If he sees that he ought to avoid that which the law condemns, and that the two commandments which form the positive part of the law are the two pillars of the blessedness of the creature; if he finds that he has constantly done and loved that which the law and his own conscience condemn, and that he has entirely failed in that which his conscience must acknowledge as being the perfection of the creature: if all that be true, where is the life which is promised to obedience?<a name=349:15></a> How escape the condemnation pronounced on the violation of the law, if he places himself on the ground of his own responsibility and has to be judged according to a rule which he himself acknowledges as perfect?<a name=349:16></a> Another law could not be found.<a name=349:17></a> If he is without law, good and evil are indifferent; that is as much as to say that man is more than wicked; even natural conscience is ruined, good does not exist, and man is unbridled in evil, save by the violence of his neighbour or the just judgment of God displayed in an event like the deluge.<a name=349:18></a> No; the law is just and good, and man knows it, his conscience tells him so.<a name=349:19></a> But if the law is good and just, man on the ground of his own responsibility is lost.<a name=349:20></a> The life which it promises to obedience man has not obtained; the judgment which will make good the authority and justice of the law awaits the one who has disobeyed it, and will at the same time be pronounced against all the shamelessness of an unbridled will.<a name=349:21></a> All the guilty will be reached.<a name=349:22></a> As to the law, as the apostle expresses it -- happily for the awakened conscience -- that which was ordained to life, man finds it to be unto death.<a name=349:23></a>

		But to return.<a name=369:1></a> The promise was absolute and unconditional, the announcement of the accomplishment of blessing on God's part through the one promised Seed, an accomplishment dependent on His own faithfulness alone.<a name=369:2></a> The question of righteousness in those who were to enjoy it was not raised.<a name=369:3></a> God's grace in blessing was revealed, and, we may say with the apostle, in Christ; but the sin of those who should enjoy it was untouched, conscience left without resource, or without raising a question indeed about it.<a name=369:4></a> The revelation of a deliverer and the promise of God were now brought together, but the state of him who was to be blessed was not entered on in any way.<a name=369:5></a> Such was the force of the unconditional promise made to Abraham.<a name=369:6></a> It made the blessing of the nations certain: the question of righteousness was not raised.<a name=369:7></a> God had promised to Abraham, and confirmed it to the one Seed.<a name=369:8></a> His faithfulness would perform it.<a name=369:9></a>

		After this came the law, redemption having been prefigured in the exodus and the passage of the Red Sea.<a name=369:10></a> The law raised the question of righteousness -- it claimed it on the part of God.<a name=369:11></a> The promise was addressed to those under it on condition of obedience.<a name=369:12></a> "If you will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people, for all the earth is mine, and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and an holy nation .<a name=369:13></a>.<a name=369:14></a>.<a name=369:15></a> .<a name=369:16></a> And all the people answered together, and said, All that Jehovah hath spoken we will do.<a name=369:17></a>"

		Here then the blessing was made dependent on the obedience of man.<a name=369:18></a> The mediator was not of one, but between two parties; and the covenant rested not simply on the infallibility of one who promised, but upon the obedience of another party also.<a name=369:19></a> For God is one: a mediator implies two parties; and here the accomplishment of the blessing rests on the condition of the obedience of the human party.<a name=369:20></a> The law then raised the question of righteousness which the promise had not at all.<a name=369:21></a> But on man's part there was utter failure as to it, and the law worked wrath and brought men under a curse.<a name=369:22></a>

		Thus, up to Christ, we have conscience, promise, and law -- law coming in by the bye <i>(pareiselthe)</i>, after the certain and infallible promise to the Seed, to raise the question of righteousness on God's part with man, stating the rule of it if man was to accomplish it for God, what creature-righteousness (if such there were) ought to, and must be.<a name=369:23></a> It came in between the promise and its fulfilment for the necessary and important object, an object which could not be passed by, of righteousness before God being laid down as needed, to make good God's claim of it against man, but against man already a sinner.<a name=369:24></a>

		I may add, before speaking of Christ's death, that He came as a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises to the fathers (for circumcision was not of Moses, but of the fathers); that is, He presented Himself as the accomplishment of the promises made to them in connection with men living in the flesh; so that, if received (that is, if man had not been utterly and wholly alienated from God), the blessing was there, both for Israel and all nations to be blessed also in the promised Seed -- the gathering of the peoples to Shiloh come in Israel -- the staves of beauty and bands would not have been broken.<a name=370:1></a> But the truth was, man was an utter sinner, his carnal mind enmity against God; and Christ, whatever grace He came in, could not but be God manifested in flesh, and light in the world.<a name=370:2></a> Without law man was lawless, under law a law-breaker; and when light and grace came, yea, God Himself, in loving-kindness and truth, he was the rejecter of all in which blessing was.<a name=370:3></a>

		Thus, however, promise also was rejected by the Jew who had it, and all was utterly lost for man; there remained no link between him and God; or rather the proof was now afforded that there was, and could be, none between God and man in the flesh.<a name=370:4></a> This -- for He was perfect love -- was, I doubt not, the sense of what was expressed by Jesus in the words, "I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!<a name=370:5></a>" The love was there, full, perfect, active in His heart.<a name=370:6></a> He shewed it in all that He did, in all it could be shewn in; but as to the proper effect of its power, its true object -- the reconciling man to Himself, it was, so to speak, driven back into Himself; blessed be God!<a name=370:7></a> unweakened, but driven back, finding no response in man's heart, nothing to which it could attach itself there, in the selfish enmity which reigned there.<a name=370:8></a> For His love He had hatred.<a name=370:9></a>

		The true heir of promise is there, and can take all the promises up in righteousness, which gives us also a title to enter into them, His position answering to Isaac's when the promise was confirmed to him after his being offered up in figure.<a name=371:9></a> All the promises of God are Yea and Amen in Him, and we are in Him.<a name=371:10></a> God having established us in Him who has taken His place in the power of a new life, as the Head of a new race belonging to Him by faith, righteous in Him, as we were sinners in the first Adam.<a name=371:11></a> And this reaches out (according to His promise) to sinners of the Gentiles as to the Jews, through the putting away of sin, and the communication of a life as new to one as to the other.<a name=371:12></a> There was no link between God and the old man, nor union between a sinless Christ and sinful flesh, though Christ was a true man come in the likeness of it.<a name=371:13></a> But there is a link between a believer and Jesus risen, in a new life given to the believer, in which, by the Holy Ghost, he is united to Him who in righteousness is before God in heavenly places.<a name=371:14></a> Christ's death writes death on all, absolute death -- all are dead.<a name=371:15></a> There is nothing in man, as he is in himself, in common with divine life in Him (hence the apostle knew Christ no more in that way, present in the world, alive in the midst of men in the flesh, the Messiah of promise alive here below); but in that same death there is the answer to the whole condition of man in the flesh as a sinner; and, in taking the new position of life in accomplished righteousness in resurrection, Christ lays the ground of righteousness in a new way (God's righteousness, not man's, though wrought out in Him who was, and is, a man, and recognized by setting that man at God's right hand), so that grace can go out according to it to the glory of God by us.<a name=371:16></a>
