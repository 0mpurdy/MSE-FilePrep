		Dearest G Gausby, -- Legality does stick to us dreadfully, because it takes the form of conscientiousness, which is an excellent thing.<a name=1:1></a> But a full sense of infinite grace changes all.<a name=1:2></a> In Romans, Christians are always looked at as living men as you and I are on the earth, who have walked as men in their sins on the earth, living in them; but who having received Christ have received life, and are justified from all their sins, but have been introduced by baptism unto His death, and, in that He died unto sin once, and lives to God in that He liveth, reckon themselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ, not in Adam; hence are free in spirit to yield themselves to God as those that are alive from the dead -- the nearest approach to being arisen, but it is as such, the whole state being reckoned such by a living man.<a name=1:3></a> Hence, taking the old man as crucified with Christ, the Christian is to walk in newness of life.<a name=1:4></a> So we shall live with Him.<a name=1:5></a> The whole is a moral change in a man viewed as alive here <i>de facto</i>, but having Christ his life, instead of the old man and living in sins.<a name=1:6></a> If we be dead with Christ, we shall live (6: 8) is a moral conclusion.<a name=1:7></a> All this is the case because man is looked at as the responsible man in this world, and finding sin in the flesh as the power of evil, is taught how to have done with its power, namely, by reckoning himself dead and alive in Christ -- not in flesh.<a name=1:8></a> Chapter 8: 3-4 gives the great basis, adding the Holy Ghost and its effects in what follows.<a name=1:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Ephesians views man in his state towards God, and no possibility of movement being awakened.<a name=1:10></a> Christ Himself is looked at only as raised from the dead when dead by God's power.<a name=1:11></a> So we are quickened together with Christ brought out of this state of death.<a name=1:12></a> Here Jew and Gentile have necessarily disappeared, children of wrath one as another, but are raised together and made to sit together; associated in a wholly new standing, not individually victorious in the old.<a name=1:13></a> In Romans the man reckons himself dead to sin; in Ephesians he was dead in sins, but is quickened with Christ who had died, and raised up and sitting no Jew nor Gentile in Christ.<a name=1:14></a> This takes me wholly out of the place I was in (not giving me a new life in it) as it took Christ out of the grave and set Him at the right hand of God, far above all principality and power, taking me out of death in sins and putting me into Him.<a name=1:15></a> It is not a living responsible man on earth counting himself dead that he may have power over sin -- not let it reign -- the old man being crucified; but a new creation, in which the dead in sins are taken out of their state and place by God's power and placed in Christ.<a name=1:16></a> There is no responsibility in Ephesians till after this.<a name=1:17></a> In Romans there is all through: in Romans nothing of counsels, save at the end of chapter 8 that is, of the Epistle doctrinally.<a name=1:18></a> God creates us in Christ according to His counsels before the world: He has met our responsibility both as to guilt and power.<a name=1:19></a> Both are all-important.<a name=1:20></a> One living in sins is dead toward God.<a name=1:21></a> I may take him up in grace, meeting his responsibility as a creature of God, or I may see him created in Christ, God's workmanship in his new estate, but then it is a wholly new thing, risen out of the state in which he was; and this involves the disappearance of the difference of Jew and Gentile.<a name=1:22></a> We get no to the Jew first, and also to the Greek, in Ephesians.<a name=1:23></a> And yet it must be a new life in Christ by which I have the power looked for in Romans.<a name=1:24></a> I do not think of flesh in Ephesians.<a name=1:25></a> It is not an actual state, but one of faith.<a name=1:26></a> Now, reckoning myself dead is thinking of the old man, that it may not reign by reckoning it dead.<a name=1:27></a> In Ephesians the truth in Christ is the having put it off and put on the new.<a name=1:28></a> Hence Ephesians is strikingly contrast all through.<a name=1:29></a> He gives himself up as a living sacrifice to God in Romans.<a name=1:30></a> [In Ephesians] he walks in love, and gives himself as Christ gave Himself, being free and coming out from God, an imitator of God.<a name=1:31></a> And all this difference is extremely instructive and beautiful.<a name=1:32></a> In Colossians you have both, only no sitting in heavenly places, but our hope there, and the actual life far more fully displayed and developed .<a name=1:33></a>.<a name=1:34></a>.<a name=1:35></a> .<a name=1:36></a>

		F G Patterson, You ask, Are the two last verses of 1 Corinthians 5 practically applicable now to those gathered together separate from evil according to 2 Timothy 2: 19-22 And, Is it correct to refuse obedience until power come in To the first I reply that the word of the Lord abides for ever.<a name=3:1></a> Its authority never ceases, and obedience is always due to it.<a name=3:2></a> Power has nothing to do with this.<a name=3:3></a> Grace is needed to induce the heart to obey, but obedience is always due.<a name=3:4></a> The direction as to tongues has not lost its authority.<a name=3:5></a> Were there tongues it would apply.<a name=3:6></a> There are not, and there is nothing to apply it to.<a name=3:7></a> But its authority remains.<a name=3:8></a> This clears up at once the question as to 1 Corinthians 5 "Put away from among yourselves that wicked person" has its own simple authority that nothing can take away.<a name=3:9></a> It applies to an assembly, including all saints professing to own the Lord everywhere (see address of the Epistle), and wherever a wicked person is found in an assembly, the case it applies to is there, and it is a simple matter of obedience.<a name=3:10></a> There are acts of power, as "I have judged to deliver to Satan.<a name=3:11></a>" He does not say, Do you do it.<a name=3:12></a> He does it in all the solemnity of the assembled saints, but there is no command, but a personal act of power, as Paul says elsewhere, "Whom I have delivered unto Satan.<a name=3:13></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The declaration or exercise of a personal act of power has nothing to do with the abiding authority of a command.<a name=3:14></a> The power may not subsist; the command does.<a name=3:15></a> That it requires the help and grace of the Lord to act upon it, is no more than is true of every command in scripture.<a name=3:16></a> To apply the ruin of the visible assembly to sanction disobedience is a principle wholly unallowable.<a name=3:17></a> I cannot appoint elders.<a name=3:18></a> It is not a question of obedience but authority, and I have not the authority.<a name=3:19></a> The assembly had it not when Paul was there, nor can they assume it now.<a name=3:20></a> They had not power as an assembly to deliver to Satan then, they have not now; but they were hound to obey the command then, they are so now.<a name=3:21></a> Wherever two or three are really gathered together in Christ's name Christ is, and there is the within and the without.<a name=3:22></a> It is a clearing of the conscience of the assembly: "Ye have proved yourselves clear in this matter.<a name=3:23></a>" Otherwise, the assembly would be the positive sanction, and by Christ's presence, of the association of Christ and sin; and it would be far better there should be no assembly at all than that.<a name=3:24></a> 2 Timothy 2 gives us the general principle of every one who calls himself a Christian, separating from iniquity, purging himself from false teachers, and walking with those who call upon the name of the Lord out of a pure heart.<a name=3:25></a> It is individual duty when evil has come in.<a name=3:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the second question, it is practically answered already.<a name=3:27></a> In bestowing power God is sovereign.<a name=3:28></a> When the word has spoken I am bound to obey.<a name=3:29></a> To refuse obedience to it is to disobey, to assume on my own will authority not to act till God chooses to do that which rests on His will.<a name=3:30></a>

		[C McAdam] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- We cannot have too clear a view of Paul's teaching union with an ascended Christ, putting us in a wholly new position.<a name=4:1></a> The more I go on, the more I see that the loss of this by the Church is the secret of their state; and it is mainly that which brethren have recovered, which God has brought out in these last days.<a name=4:2></a> But it is just that that makes it so important that the truth should not be discredited, by denying or in any way discrediting any other part of scripture.<a name=4:3></a> It is curious that this was just the ruin of the Paulicians.<a name=4:4></a> They had nothing else but Paul's epistles and the gospels, and their adversary took up this very point against them, a certain Peter,<a href="#4:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> if I remember.<a name=4:5></a> But it is a mistake to think Paul only speaks of this new place; John does too.<a name=4:6></a> But that is not all: the other parts of scripture are the word of God, and if any have not attained to Paul's doctrine, we are to walk by the same rule.<a name=4:7></a> Besides, the other aspects of the truth are as important in their place as that.<a name=4:8></a> Where that truth is held alone, there is a hardness, a want of daily dependence which leaves the best christian affections dormant.<a name=4:9></a> Besides, the whole system is false.<a name=4:10></a> Those other parts of the New Testament were certainly available for Christians then, and if so, for Christians now.<a name=4:11></a> "Holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling," is clearly christian ground; and wilderness life is a part of christian life, as Canaan and conflict are.<a name=4:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Further, the person who makes light of John's writings, makes light of the manifestation of God and of the Father and makes his own acceptance before God the only thing of importance now.<a name=4:13></a> This is a very bad state of soul, and such are clearly on low ground.<a name=4:14></a> We have to maintain redemption against the Puseyite heresy of making incarnation the saving work.<a name=4:15></a> But if we hold redemption tenaciously fast, the Bread come down from heaven to give life must not be lost.<a name=4:16></a> And as to Peter, if I lose his writings I lose the government of God and the connection of this in christian times with Old Testament times.<a name=4:17></a> Now the glory of God is concerned in these things, and it is a poor boast of knowledge to leave that aside and think only of what exalts us.<a name=4:18></a> So of Jude, where it directly concerns the professing church.<a name=4:19></a> In no place is Christ's personal glory, as Christ, brought out more fully than in Hebrews.<a name=4:20></a> Is that nothing for the Christian, because the unity of the body is not brought out Even Paul's epistles give different aspects of truth.<a name=4:21></a> The Epistle to the Romans does not hint at our resurrection with Christ, nor allude to Christ's ascension, save once in chapter 8, to lay the ground for intercession, which is really dropped out of their scheme.<a name=4:22></a> Ephesians never goes on Romans ground at all: Colossians takes up in substance both.<a name=4:23></a> Their vaunted clearness is not, sound knowledge, but rejection of many important parts of truth, and uniformly produces self-sufficiency and hardness, not personal dependence on grace and on Christ.<a name=4:24></a>

		Many have had difficulty in going with poor, whose teaching could not go down in London, and they did not break bread with him: he is personally a lovable man, but I confess I should have myself, though I know not to what extent he has given ground for any active dealing with it.<a name=4:25></a> I know his views (as they were some few years ago) well, and reject them as alike false and mischievous.<a name=4:26></a> It may be the case of warning brethren not to go there, when he occasion calls for it, and presenting a clear determined front of utter condemnation and rejection when any come across it as you have, and as I heard of it in the north, and dealing with it as intolerable, and watching any sign of its spreading.<a name=4:27></a> People may be easily misled by it, because there are important truths, often dropped, which their system brings forward.<a name=4:28></a> And some may err without being heretical.<a name=4:29></a> But I should resist at any rate, and take up immediately any teaching of the error.<a name=4:30></a> It is gross and mischievous ignorance, not light, to say nothing of disposing cavalierly of the word of God.<a name=4:31></a> To whom was the Epistle to the Hebrews addressed unbelieving, blaspheming Jews, or believing ones who had taken joyfully the spoiling of their goods?<a name=4:32></a> It is really wonderful how people can be so bamboozled; only, will is at work, and that must be kept in mind, and taken notice of<a href="#4:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a>.<a name=4:33></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		No great news from this.<a name=4:34></a> The brethren have been encouraged, and needed it, and souls have been added, and I trust several others blessed.<a name=4:35></a> They have taken the visit cordially.<a name=4:36></a> At Barbados there is more inquiry than here.<a name=4:37></a> Still the testimony has reached souls .<a name=4:38></a>.<a name=4:39></a>.<a name=4:40></a> .<a name=4:41></a> The brethren are going on well, though they have had cases of discipline and needed rousing and setting on solid ground the most about 350 in the colony.<a name=4:42></a> Here, Georgetown, the work is comparatively recent.<a name=4:43></a> W.<a name=4:44></a> is arrived, and I (D.<a name=4:45></a>V.<a name=4:46></a>) leave for Barbados by next mail.<a name=4:47></a> All well through mercy.<a name=4:48></a> The heat is not so very bad, only always grapes ripening fast, etc.<a name=4:49></a>

		[Sydney Smith] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I am anxious about a rumour I heard of your becoming a doctor, and I am sure you will forgive my anxiety for the Lord's sake and yours .<a name=6:1></a>.<a name=6:2></a>.<a name=6:3></a> .<a name=6:4></a> I look to the principle.<a name=6:5></a> Christ has ordained that they that preach the gospel should live of the gospel, and it is the clear duty of the church of God to aid those who are given up to the work.<a name=6:6></a> If a man can give himself wholly up to the work, and as an extra support himself by a trade he has already all well.<a name=6:7></a> I have known a brother, an evangelist much blessed, who so lived, when at a certain period of the year the people (from work) could not get on weekdays to meetings and he being a good watchmaker, mended all the watches in the country the rest of the year was helped by brethren.<a name=6:8></a> This is all well .<a name=6:9></a>.<a name=6:10></a>.<a name=6:11></a> .<a name=6:12></a> But when I set about to learn a profession or trade, it is not merely the time, but Christ, and Christ's work, is put in a second place, and faith is set aside as to that, and the church encouraged in want of devotedness.<a name=6:13></a> All this seems to me evil.<a name=6:14></a> If you were not working for the Lord, your setting to do something would be perfectly right; but you are at the work, and it is saying, I fear not in your heart perhaps, but as testimony "I have put my hand to the plough," etc.<a name=6:15></a> I have never known but one case where a brother actually wanted: it was not known to brethren: a devoted pioneer, who pushed into unbroken ground in France.<a name=6:16></a> He fed on nettle tops, which they use much as spinach, not to give up an open door.<a name=6:17></a> The same man has been three times in prison.<a name=6:18></a> That was a bright testimony.<a name=6:19></a> I doubt you are quite there yet, and have been pinched, but so was Paul, and the Lord has very soon come in to help them.<a name=6:20></a> It may seem easy for me who want for nothing to press this on others, but I honestly began by giving up everything, though in point of fact my faith was never tried in that way, as an uncle left me something before I was run out, or very soon after.<a name=6:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I dread settling the principle, when a man is a labourer, that the church is not to take care that those who labour shall be honoured by being temporally cared for: no salary.<a name=6:22></a> A man is a servant, but free under Christ in his ministry, and the privilege of the church, as those at Philippi, to be partakers in the grace by helping him who labours in it.<a name=6:23></a> It blocks up the path of simple, humble faith.<a name=6:24></a> A poor man has no difficulty: and it seems as if an educated person could take this blessed and honoured place of service to Christ: working when we can, and are not occupied in the work all well, as I said.<a name=6:25></a> But taking up a profession is really saying I have laid down that of working for the Lord, trusting to Him who knows that we have need of these things.<a name=6:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have not seen the Lord leave those who have given themselves up to work, trusting Him: and I have seen distress of spirit and greatly hindered usefulness [in those] who, through their wives or own hearts, have turned to other things to help wife or family here.<a name=6:27></a> The most beloved and able witness was saved from great injury to his own spirit and usefulness, by its making him thoroughly miserable, and it did hinder him.<a name=6:28></a> There it was a wife's doing; but no matter what, the difficulties are what faith has to overcome.<a name=6:29></a> I am a very poor one for faith, but I am sure the Lord is sufficient, and that He will never fail us.<a name=6:30></a> He may try our faith, but He will meet it and rejoice our hearts.<a name=6:31></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here, a small place, there has been really considerable blessing.<a name=6:32></a> No doubt many curious ones will drop off, but a goodly number of souls have come under the power of the Spirit and truth of God.<a name=6:33></a> We leave (D.<a name=6:34></a>V.<a name=6:35></a>) this week for Jamaica .<a name=6:36></a>.<a name=6:37></a>.<a name=6:38></a> .<a name=6:39></a> The gracious Lord guide and teach you.<a name=6:40></a>

		DEAR BRETHREN, -- I write for both, because I hardly know who is in -- , indeed for all, as to my heart's desire; and you will not be astonished at my being interested in the assembly there.<a name=10:1></a> I have heard from Mr.<a name=10:2></a> -- , and also through another, only one side of course of the circumstances, and consequently I say little of them; N.<a name=10:3></a>, indeed, alluded to the question raised, but not to circumstances.<a name=10:4></a> I shall refer chiefly to principles, for you will feel that we are all, as of one body, interested in the position taken, and still more in the glory of Christ and our brethren's welfare.<a name=10:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The question is, as to reception of saints to partake of the table of the Lord with us, whether any can be admitted who are not formally and regularly amongst us.<a name=10:6></a> It is not whether we exclude persons unsound in faith or ungodly in practice; nor whether we, deliberately walking with those who are unsound and ungodly, are not in the same guilt -- not clear in the matter.<a name=10:7></a> The first is unquestioned; the last, brethren have insisted on, and I among them, at very painful cost to ourselves.<a name=10:8></a> This is, to me, all clear and plain from scripture.<a name=10:9></a> There may be subtle pleas to get evil allowed, but we have always been firm, and God, I believe, has fully owned it.<a name=10:10></a> The question is not there; but suppose a person known to be godly and sound in faith, who has not left some ecclesiastical system nay thinks scripture favours an ordained ministry, but is glad when the occasion occurs suppose we alone are in the place, or he is not in connection with any other body in the place, staying with a brother, or the like is he to be excluded because he is of some system as to which his conscience is not enlightened nay, which he may think more right?<a name=10:11></a> He is a godly member of the body, known such.<a name=10:12></a> Is he to be shut out?<a name=10:13></a> If so the degree of light is title to communion, and the unity of the body is denied by the assembly which refuses him.<a name=10:14></a> The principle of meeting as members of Christ walking in godliness is given up, agreement with us is made the rule, and the assembly becomes a sect with its members like any other.<a name=10:15></a> They meet on their principles, Baptist -- or other you on yours, and if they do not belong to you formally as such, you do not let them in.<a name=10:16></a> The principle of brethren's meetings is gone, and another sect is made, say with more light, and that is all.<a name=10:17></a> It may give more trouble, require more care to treat every case on its merits on the principle of the unity of all Christ's members, than say "you do not belong to us, you cannot come"; but the whole principle of meeting is gone.<a name=10:18></a> The path is not of God.<a name=10:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have heard, and I partly believe it, for I have heard some rash and violent people say it elsewhere, that the various sectarian celebrations of the supper are tables of devils.<a name=10:20></a> But this proves only the unbrokenness and ignorance of him who says it.<a name=10:21></a> The heathen altars are called tables of devils because, and expressly because, what they offered they offered (according to Deuteronomy 32: 17) to devils, and not to God.<a name=10:22></a> But to call christian assemblies by profession, ignorant it may be of ecclesiastical truth, and hence meeting wrongly, tables of devils is monstrous nonsense, and shews the bad state of him who so talks.<a name=10:23></a> No sober man, no honest man, can deny that scripture means something totally different.<a name=10:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have heard -- I do not know whether it be true -- that it has been said that the brethren in England act on this ground.<a name=10:25></a> If this has been said, it is simply and totally false.<a name=10:26></a> There have been new gatherings formed during my absence in America which I have never visited; but the older ones, long walking as brethren, I have known from the beginning have always received known Christians, and everywhere, I have no doubt, the newer ones too, and so in every country.<a name=10:27></a> I have known individuals take up the thought, one at any rate at Toronto, but the assembly always received true Christians: three broke bread in this way the last Lord's day I was in London.<a name=10:28></a> There cannot be too much care as to holiness and truth: the Spirit is the Holy Spirit, and the Spirit of truth.<a name=10:29></a> But ignorance of ecclesiastical truth is not a ground of excommunication, where the conscience and the walk is undefiled.<a name=10:30></a> If a person came and made it a condition to be allowed to go to both, he would not come in simplicity in the unity of the body; I know it to be evil, and cannot allow it, and he has no right to impose any conditions on the church of God.<a name=10:31></a> It must exercise discipline as cases arise according to the Word.<a name=10:32></a> Nor, indeed, do I think a person regularly going from one to another systematically can be honest in going to either; he is setting up to be superior to both, and condescending to each.<a name=10:33></a> That is not, <i>in that act</i>, "a pure heart.<a name=10:34></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		May the Lord guide you.<a name=10:35></a> Remember, you are acting as representing the whole church of God, and if you depart from a right path as to the principle of meeting, separating yourselves from it is to be a local sect on your own principles.<a name=10:36></a> In all that concerns faithfulness, God is my witness, I seek no looseness; but Satan is busy to lead us one side or the other, to destroy the largeness of the unity of the body, or to make it mere looseness in practice and doctrine; we must not fall into one in avoiding the other.<a name=10:37></a> Reception of all true saints is what gives its force to the exclusion of those walking loosely.<a name=10:38></a> If I exclude all who walk godlily as well, who do not follow with us, it loses its force, for those who are godly are shut out too.<a name=10:39></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is no membership of brethren.<a name=10:40></a> Membership of an assembly is unknown to scripture.<a name=10:41></a> It is members of Christ's body.<a name=10:42></a> If people must be all of you, it is practically membership of your body.<a name=10:43></a> The Lord keep us from it; that is simply dissenting ground.<a name=10:44></a>

		[C McAdam] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I was very glad to get your account of the brethren: I need not say my interest is only increased by absence.<a name=12:1></a> As to -- , I am not aware I said anything that shewed I could break bread there.<a name=12:2></a> I do make a difference between the meeting and him; if the meeting was sound might go and get it to deal with him.<a name=12:3></a> Why is it to be judged for his doctrine unless it has intelligently accepted it?<a name=12:4></a> I attach great importance to the body.<a name=12:5></a> I might avoid the place, if there was no way of dealing with it, as Paul did at Corinth -- not going to the evil, but looking first to its correction.<a name=12:6></a> Have brethren informed themselves, and dealt with the conscience of the gathering?<a name=12:7></a> I do not know that I could go, but I should not judge the gathering till the gathering had been dealt with.<a name=12:8></a> Brethren may have done this, but has any one competent to meet him, "to convince gainsayers," dealt with the gathering itself?<a name=12:9></a> I gave six weeks to Plymouth, going to Guernsey before I left it, nor did till W.<a name=12:10></a> H.<a name=12:11></a> wrote to H.<a name=12:12></a> that I had tried to turn them into a dissenting meeting, and get the body itself to judge evil, and that they could not judge elders.<a name=12:13></a> Then I left, because avowedly as a body they refused to do it.<a name=12:14></a> We owe it to these poor saints to deliver all, or any possible, if we can.<a name=12:15></a> But it should not be merely rejection of -- 's notions, the extend of which I am ignorant of (though I hear he has gone forward in error), but care for the poor saints there and the gathering he is corrupting .<a name=12:16></a>.<a name=12:17></a>.<a name=12:18></a> .<a name=12:19></a>

		The brethren in London cannot judge the gathering as such, but they can seek to deliver the poor of the flock, and deal individually with him as with any saint anywhere.<a name=12:20></a> We have dealt with loose assemblies when the case arose, and quite right -- it was keeping clear ourselves -- cannot be too decided.<a name=12:21></a> What brethren have to do now is to seek the deliverance of these souls if the Lord may help them to it, and with -- to deal individually for his good, in discipline, if the question arises by his presence anywhere, so that it is called for.<a name=12:22></a> Individuals of course can deal with them according to what is given them.<a name=12:23></a> But -- should understand that discipline arises for an assembly when its purity is in question.<a name=12:24></a> Public teachers of error may always be dealt with individually as such; when I say always, I mean of course under God's guidance.<a name=12:25></a>

		[From the French.<a name=15:1></a>] -- - I believe that the bread remains simply and absolute bread, and the wine, wine -- that, physically, there is no change whatever in the elements.<a name=15:2></a> To seek for material and physical things in such a precious institution of the Lord is, to my mind, a poor and miserable manner of regarding it.<a name=15:3></a> I have a charming portrait of my mother, which reminds me of her just as she was.<a name=15:4></a> If I am told of the canvas or the colouring I should feel that those who spoke thus knew nothing about it.<a name=15:5></a> That would not be my mother.<a name=15:6></a> That which is precious in it to me is my mother herself; and they turn my attention from her to the means employed to recall her to me; and the reason is, that they have no idea of what my mother is to me.<a name=15:7></a> The portrait has no value except as far as it is a good representation of her who is not there.<a name=15:8></a> I say, It is my mother.<a name=15:9></a> I could not throw it aside as a mere piece of canvas; I discern my mother in it.<a name=15:10></a> I cherish this portrait; I carry it with me; but if I stop at the perfection of the painting as a work of art, the link with my heart is lost.<a name=15:11></a>

		There is more than this in the Supper of our Lord, because the Lord is really present <i>with us</i> in it spiritually according to the intention of the institution; and this is very precious.<a name=15:12></a> But it has pleased Him to give us a physical means by which we may be reminded of Him, so that I am authorised to speak of a portrait by way of comparison.<a name=15:13></a> I have still further authority to repel the idea of any physical change in the bred and wine, in that the Lord has said, in John 6, which you have quoted, "The Spirit quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing.<a name=15:14></a>" The verses of this chapter, however, which speak of eating His flesh and drinking His blood, do not speak at all of the Lord's supper, but of Christ: I am, I do not say persuaded, but sure of this.<a name=15:15></a> The supper speaks of that of which the chapter speaks; but the chapter does not speak of the supper the symbol but of the thing symbolised.<a name=15:16></a> This is perfectly evident; one has only to read the chapter to see it.<a name=15:17></a> If the application that has been made of it to the supper be correct, then not one of those who have partaken of it would be lost, and he who had not partaken of it would be lost, whatever he might be; and those who participate of it would not only be <i>blessed</i>, but they would be eternally saved.<a name=15:18></a> (See vers.<a name=15:19></a> 53, 54.<a name=15:20></a>) Further, the Saviour says that it is of Himself, come down from heaven, that He speaks (not of the supper) of the same Person who will ascend up where He was before in heaven.<a name=15:21></a> (Vers.<a name=15:22></a> 35-41, 48, 51, 58-62.<a name=15:23></a>)

		The Supper presents Christ in only one of these conditions, but in that which is, so to speak, central: it presents to us a dead Christ; but this foundation of all, this precious truth which could be a motive even for the Father Himself to love Christ this fact that it is a dead Christ which is presented to us, is the proof that we could not have a living Christ presented to us in the elements.<a name=15:24></a> This would be to deny the state of death, and to destroy the object and intention of the institution.<a name=15:25></a> This institution presents to us the death of Christ -- a dead Christ -- His body broken and His blood shed; but there <i>exists no dead Christ</i>.<a name=15:26></a> He desires that we should remember Him: "Do this in remembrance of me;" but I do not speak of the remembrance of Christ living in heaven.<a name=15:27></a> I live by Him; He is my life; I enjoy communion with Him; I dwell in Him; He dwells in me: there is no separation.<a name=15:28></a> If, through my folly, communion is interrupted, it is no question of remembering Him, but of being with Him anew with a Saviour who manifests Himself to us as He does not to the world.<a name=15:29></a>

		And see where these poor Roman Catholics (and I love them much) have been brought by their material explanation of this precious institution.<a name=15:30></a> They wish it should be taken according to the letter ("the letter killeth"); so they take away, in the literal sense, the blood; they do not drink the cup: and this is very important, because the fact that the blood is out of the body is the sign of death of the efficacious work of Christ we are reconciled, justified by the blood.<a name=15:31></a> In order to compensate for this loss, they teach that the body, soul, blood, and divinity of Jesus Christ are in [each of] the two kinds.<a name=15:32></a> Now, if the blood is in the body, there is no redemption; without their knowing it, their sacrament is a sacrament of the non-accomplishment of redemption.<a name=15:33></a> This is the effect of materialising this institution There is no greater proof of the manner in which Satan makes sport of men, when they leave the Spirit for the flesh, than this fact, which is the centre of the Roman Catholic system.<a name=15:34></a> I affirm positively that their Eucharist is a sacrament, not of redemption, <i>but of non-redemption</i>.<a name=15:35></a> If you tell me that many among them think of the Saviour, of the efficacy of His death, I rejoice to believe it; but for this they must quit the materialism of their system for the thoughts of faith.<a name=15:36></a> They think, then, of the blood shed, and they drink it; they think of a Saviour dead and a body broken, and they really eat His flesh.<a name=15:37></a> Satan has not in this case -- blessed be God!<a name=15:38></a> -- been able to hide from their faith that which is denied in the form to which they attach so much value.<a name=15:39></a>

		It is the same thing in John 6 as in chapter 3, where we are said to be born of water.<a name=15:40></a> If that is applied to baptism then we are born of God by the water.<a name=15:41></a> It is the same system everywhere -- a system which the enemy has introduced into the church to destroy the necessity and the power of a real work in the heart, and to reduce Christianity to the level of Judaism; that is to say, to a religion of forms, adding to these forms a pretension, which is not found even in Judaism, to confer on man that which Christianity alone gives him.<a name=15:42></a> Baptism [they say] procures for us that of which John 3 speaks, whereas it is said (John 15) we are cleansed by the word; "the washing of water by the word" (Ephesians 5: 26), which reveals the Word living, dead and raised again for us.<a name=15:43></a>

		Now, do we by this diminish the importance or the sweetness of this institution?<a name=15:44></a> Quite the contrary; we hinder the materialising of it, and we insist that the spiritual realisation, or that which it represents, be in the heart, instead of that which is called an opus operatum, which is purely material.<a name=15:45></a> We are united to a Christ glorified; this is the point of departure: there is no longer a dead Christ; death has no more dominion over Him.<a name=15:46></a> I enjoy communion with a glorified Christ; I am one with Him; I shall be like Him.<a name=15:47></a> I rejoice; my heart is full of love at the thought of seeing Him, at the hope of the glory of waking up in His likeness.<a name=15:48></a> Shall I, therefore, forget His death and His sufferings?<a name=15:49></a> God forbid!<a name=15:50></a> It is precisely this which binds us to Christ by the most tender affections.<a name=15:51></a> There where He had to suffer and to do everything, He was alone; my heart at least will be with Him.<a name=15:52></a> He does not ask me to be one with Him there; I could not have been.<a name=15:53></a> There He was willing to be alone blessed be His name!<a name=15:54></a> and He has accomplished all.<a name=15:55></a> But the heart which would give itself for me there is the same which thinks of me now, and which loves me.<a name=15:56></a> In remembering His death, His love, His sufferings what shall I say?<a name=15:57></a> -- divine though human!<a name=15:58></a> I am united in heart with Him there, where He is, on high; it is not another person, another love.<a name=15:59></a> Whether in the supper, where we remember Him in such a peculiar and touching way, or whether at other moments, when I think of His death, when I eat Him as dying for me, I am in communion with Him living, and I realise the love of Him who lives that same love, that same heart of the Saviour; I dwell in Him, and He in me.<a name=15:60></a> It is not said exactly, "Do this in remembrance" of my death, but "of me.<a name=15:61></a>" Still we remember Him on the earth, in His incarnation, in His life of humiliation, and finally and specially as dead on the cross.<a name=15:62></a> I remember <i>Him</i>!<a name=15:63></a> -- not Him in the heavens, but Him who lives in heaven as once humbled and dead for me: there is also a certain action of the heart we eat.<a name=15:64></a> In John v the Son of God quickens whom He will: here (chapter 6) we eat the bread come down from heaven; we eat His body, and we drink His blood.<a name=15:65></a>

		It is most important to understand that it is a dead Christ, who in this state exists no longer, because we cannot have any relationship with a Christ living on the earth.<a name=15:66></a> If even as Jews we had had this relationship, we should have been obliged to say with Paul, "Though we have known Christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more.<a name=15:67></a>" Death has put an end to all the relations of Christ with the world, according to the flesh, and He lives now as Head of a new race the second Man.<a name=15:68></a> Thus then, in John 6: 53, the Lord lays down, as a necessary condition of life, the eating of His flesh, and the drinking of His blood -- receiving Him in His death.<a name=15:69></a> Hence we remember Him before His resurrection; we are united to Him, as living, after His resurrection, as He has said, "Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it <i>abideth alone</i>; but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.<a name=15:70></a>" Thus our union is with a Christ glorified; we do not know Him otherwise: but the most powerful spring of affection for the heart is a Christ, man in the world, and a dead Christ.<a name=15:71></a> I am nourished by this; I eat it, and I live by this; but if we wish to bring back, so to speak, a Christ such as He has been in this world, as present, we overthrow entirely the intention of this institution, and even Christianity itself.<a name=15:72></a> Every time that we eat this bread and drink this cup, we shew the Lord's death till He come; but if we will introduce a living Christ to animate this dead one, so to speak we destroy Him.<a name=15:73></a> Why then is it said, "They discern not the Lord's body?<a name=15:74></a>" What body?<a name=15:75></a> His dead body.<a name=15:76></a> A perfect love, His accomplished work, an obedience which was arrested by no difficulty, present themselves to our eyes!<a name=15:77></a> Is there anything else there but a dead body?<a name=15:78></a> .<a name=15:79></a>.<a name=15:80></a>.<a name=15:81></a> If so, I know not where I am, nor what the supper means.<a name=15:82></a> Do not animate it with the life that Christ had before death: His obedience was not yet finished, nor His work accomplished, nor His love perfectly demonstrated.<a name=15:83></a> Do not animate it with the life of a Christ now risen: you take Him from me as dead; death is no more there -- death which is the basis of salvation, the proof of obedience the glorification of God.<a name=15:84></a> Take not from me this death, this body <i>broken</i>, this blood for ever shed, which tells me that all is accomplished, and -- through the love of my Saviour -- that sin is put away for ever.<a name=15:85></a> If you can lead me to grasp yet more firmly what is precious in this dead Saviour, in the death of Him who is the eternal Son of God; if you can make me eat Him with more faith, more spiritually, with more divine intelligence, more heart -- ah!<a name=15:86></a> I shall be very grateful to you; but let it be my dead Saviour that is left to me!<a name=15:87></a> When one is in communion with Him living, there is nothing so precious as His Death; yes, precious even to God.<a name=15:88></a> "Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.<a name=15:89></a>" For my spiritual intelligence it is the end of, or rather the proof and the consciousness that I have done with, the first Adam; that the first creation no longer exists blessed be God!<a name=15:90></a> for faith: for the heart it is the tender and perfect love of the Saviour.<a name=15:91></a> I am no more either Jew or Gentile, or a man living on the earth; I am a Christian.<a name=15:92></a> The death of Christ, Head of all, has put an end to the first creation.<a name=15:93></a> He has introduced us into a new creation as firstfruits united to Him.<a name=15:94></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I discern then the body of the Lord, but the body of the Lord broken -- His blood shed -- His death.<a name=15:95></a> It is not an ordinary repast, a simple remembrance, if you will, but an institution that Christ has given to His own; not that they may find in the elements anything else than the bread and the fruit of the vine, but that their faith may, in the sweetest way, by the power of the Holy Spirit, nourish itself by Jesus, by that which He has been for them when He died upon the cross a work of which the efficacy remains eternally, even to the Father's eye, but of which the love is all for us.<a name=15:96></a> If I treat this memorial with lightness, I am guilty of the body and blood of the Lord, for it is that body and blood which are presented to me in it.<a name=15:97></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I doubt if there is any one in the world who enjoys the Lord's supper more than I do (though I doubt not that there is with many more piety); but that which makes me enjoy it is that it presents to me the body and blood of my Saviour dead, and consequently a perfect love and a perfect work.<a name=15:98></a> But He cannot be in His dead body, which I discern there by faith.<a name=15:99></a> He is in me, that I may enjoy Him; if He is introduced living, that which I ought to discern no longer exists.<a name=15:100></a> All this is in connection with the fact of the entirely new position of the living Christ a doctrine which Paul presents to us with such divine energy, and which the enemy has always sought to hide, even under the form of piety, and for the preservation of which Paul so contended.<a name=15:101></a> What anguish he suffered from the efforts of the enemy to draw souls back to Judaism, as if they were still living in the world!<a name=15:102></a> "Ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.<a name=15:103></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		May God give us to discern yet more the body of Jesus -- to eat His flesh and to realise His death more!<a name=15:104></a> Yes: this death is precious.<a name=15:105></a> It meets us in our need just as we are, and it delivers us from it by introducing us there, where He is, in the power of a new life which by His death knows not the old.<a name=15:106></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have written you at much length.<a name=15:107></a> I could willingly enlarge on this subject, for instead of thinking lightly of the supper of the Lord, it is of all institutions the most precious to me; only to be so it must be a dead Saviour that is presented to me in it.<a name=15:108></a> I am living with Him now in heaven.<a name=15:109></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another aspect -- the unity of the body -- which I have not touched on, though it be a precious side of the truth of this institution of the Lord: but it is outside your question.<a name=15:110></a> I hope you may, at least, apprehend the ground of my thought, though I write in great haste.<a name=15:111></a>

		DEAR BRETHREN, -- All exclusive points are out of place at the Lord's table.<a name=21:1></a> It is clear Christ's death is before us; but eij" th;n ejmh;n ajnavmnhsin, or eij" th;n ajnavmnhsivn mou does not affect the question as to whether it is a remembrance of Himself or only of His death.<a name=21:2></a> One way or the other, ejmh;n is "of me;" and whether it be ejmh;n or mou, the only difference is that putting ejmh;n before makes it somewhat more emphatic and contrasted.<a name=21:3></a> It was not to be done in remembrance of deliverance from Egypt, as the passover was, but in remembrance of Him, "in my memory.<a name=21:4></a>" But the simple answer to this link breaking out of the sentence is, that there is nothing about it in it.<a name=21:5></a> The Greek does not mean breaking every link with the creation, and says nothing about it: that is a simple fact.<a name=21:6></a> Should any one press it as a consequence, if led by the Spirit of God, all well and shew that Christ's death involved it; if it be so is another matter, but it is not in that sentence.<a name=21:7></a> I am not quite sure that I understand it, and though I am quite disposed to see a right intention in those who taught it, for it was breaking with the world, I doubt a little that they do any more.<a name=21:8></a> My impression is that their intention is right, and that they aim at an important truth; but I cannot go quite so fast as some.<a name=21:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When He comes again and takes this earth, and governs it and blesses it, it is as Himself risen: that is true; but you can hardly call this world then the new creation.<a name=21:10></a> 'The link of life in Him with this world was broken': but then I should be a little shy of speaking of His being linked with it at any time, though coming into it as a true man, born of a woman, for the suffering of death, and partaking ( paraplhsivw" ) of flesh and blood.<a name=21:11></a> But He says, "They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.<a name=21:12></a>" And again, "Ye are of this world, I am not of this world.<a name=21:13></a>" "Ye are from beneath, I am from above.<a name=21:14></a>" Yet, I repeat, I believe the object to be right; that is, that we are crucified to the world, and the world to us: at least, I am quite ready to suppose so.<a name=21:15></a> But I affirm positively it is not in eij" th;n ejmh;n ajnavmnhsin; though it be in death He is symbolised before us, it is Him we remember, and I doubt that the form in which it is put could be made good from scripture; and scripture is wiser than we are.<a name=21:16></a> But, as an effect, it does imply our having died to this world; for we shew forth the Lord's death till He come.<a name=21:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I cannot admit with this absoluteness, that every Christian is, according to scripture, dead to the old creation, because his body is of the old creation.<a name=21:18></a> We are waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of the body.<a name=21:19></a> I see it held up as desirable that a man should live absolutely in the power of the Spirit and know nothing else.<a name=21:20></a> Still "he that marrieth does well.<a name=21:21></a>" Of what creation is that?<a name=21:22></a> And he that forbids to marry does very ill.<a name=21:23></a> I see two things: God's part in the old creation as yet fully recognised; marriage as "at the beginning"; children; amiable nature (the Lord loved the young man, when He looked on him); but, a power brought in wholly above and out of it.<a name=21:24></a> If one lives according to this all well; it is to be desired; but to condemn the former is to condemn God.<a name=21:25></a> Sin has come in and spoiled it; and there is thus hindrance, care, sorrow in the flesh, that is true; but God ordered it in the beginning, and God owns what He ordered, till He brings in something new.<a name=21:26></a> Dead to sin, to the world to the law this I find in scripture; but not to the old creation.<a name=21:27></a> And this is the place of every Christian, and he is to hold himself so.<a name=21:28></a> But dead to the old creation, God does not say; for it is God's creation, and every creature of God is good.<a name=21:29></a> Live above it; in its present state, all well, and better, if it be given to us: but death to the first creation, and breaking every link with it, is not true, whilst we are in the body.<a name=21:30></a> Scripture does not say so, and scripture, I say again, is much wiser than we are.<a name=21:31></a> There is a new creation, and, as in Christ, we are of it -- I think we may say, the firstfruits of it "of his creatures," at any rate.<a name=21:32></a> Kainh; ktivsi": it is a very singular expression.<a name=21:33></a> (2 Corinthians 5: 17.<a name=21:34></a>) It is not "he is," as in English, but merely affirms its existence and character for one in Christ: but then when it goes on to say He died, it is not to the old creation; but "he who knew no sin was made sin"; and elsewhere, "In that he died, he died unto sin once.<a name=21:35></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is wise and safe not to go beyond scripture.<a name=21:36></a> Fresh truths and mighty powers fill our sails, and it is well; but they may, if we trust them and the consequences we draw, carry our minds on to rocks hidden underneath the surface.<a name=21:37></a> The word of God checks, or keeps us rather, in the right and safe course.<a name=21:38></a> The first intentions may be right; but when not so kept, when one's mind is trusted, it may run into open ungodliness the common result of the human mind being trusted with mighty truths, or rather trusting itself with them; and in these days this has to be watched .<a name=21:39></a>.<a name=21:40></a>.<a name=21:41></a> .<a name=21:42></a>

		It is a very humbling thing to think how always at the first what God has set up was spoiled.<a name=21:43></a> We have only the power of good in the midst of evil, till the Lord comes, when power is not, rest is.<a name=21:44></a> But Philadelphia marks our state; and as we find truth spreading, decision in walk and waiting for Christ (not the doctrine merely of His coming) will be the test.<a name=21:45></a> Devotedness, heavenly-mindedness these are what we must look for.<a name=21:46></a> The foolish virgins were awake with the wise, but not ready.<a name=21:47></a> I have no doubt the doctrines we hold are penetrating widely.<a name=21:48></a> It is another thing to have the heart in heaven and to depart from evil on earth.<a name=21:49></a><br>[1869.<a name=21:50></a>]

		I find a great difference, both as to the application of the word and as to prayer for ourselves and others, between being in the sanctuary or <i>without</i>.<a name=34:16></a> I can apply the word honestly to my ways and comfort as being here, and pray for my wants and the wants of others, as here, and it is all quite right; but I may be within.<a name=34:17></a> The word comes down from above, reveals God, and in grace; it does give me light down here in fact, but it can also take me up there, and form my heart, and desires, and spirit, and joys too, with what is there, and so my prayers.<a name=34:18></a> If in there, what a place and kind of place, they have in my heart; they are clothed with Christ love, with His character, as what they ought to be, as for His glory, and theirs too indeed; and my prayers flow from seeing them in that, that they may be brought into it: the spirit, and character, and love of the place I am in, will be in my prayers.<a name=34:19></a> Oh!<a name=34:20></a> it is a great privilege, a great blessing.<a name=34:21></a> I do not write as if I could do it much, for it is the very thing I have to judge myself in -- how little real power of intercession I find in myself, but I see the difference.<a name=34:22></a> It is anything but carelessness as to walk, called charity, but charity, about the walk.<a name=34:23></a> Though I admit the difference of dispensations, yet I see the identification of the people with God's glory alone, was the spring of Moses's prayer; and the same thing made him call the faithful to cut off his neighbour and brother down here.<a name=34:24></a> Ours is the one in grace and dependence; be it so, but there is a principle which shews it is not taking evil lightly.<a name=34:25></a> New York surely I prayed about in earnest, I was in the West Indies, and could not get there.<a name=34:26></a> One thing I can say, if I have worked in a place it is always on my heart.<a name=34:27></a> I am old, my brother, but if I am spared my strength yet longer, I should like to see you all at Boston again.<a name=34:28></a> The <i>Lord</i> be with you, <i>that</i> is what is good.<a name=34:29></a>

		This is why I said it is a deep work: it makes the soul simple, but it does not find it so.<a name=36:11></a> I do not look that you should be able to give an account of it intellectually, but that the thing itself should be done, and that you should find yourself stripped of self by the discovery of sin, leaning upon the righteousness of God which He has made ours, in giving us Christ, our precious Saviour.<a name=36:12></a> Peace be to you then in the name of [Him who shed] that precious blood which cleanses from all sin.<a name=36:13></a> Be watchful and look to God, opening all your heart to Him in through confidence.<a name=36:14></a> This is what puts truth into the soul, and He is worthy of it, through His perfect goodness to us.<a name=36:15></a>

		[G Biava] [From the French] DEAREST BROTHER, -- I have just received your letter here, where I was to have come straight from England when I took Switzerland and France first for our meetings, but I was obliged to return to this place, when I had done that.<a name=46:1></a> I am only resuming my former work.<a name=46:2></a> It is six years since I have been here, and I have felt in turning my face and directing my steps here, that God was with me.<a name=46:3></a> Just now I am busy correcting the Old Testament, which has been already compared, and which I am now comparing with the Hebrew.<a name=46:4></a> You must not, on that account, think that I have given up Italy; I am waiting the moment God wills, and am busy with Italian.<a name=46:5></a> I am now reading a bad tract on regeneration, published in Florence, but written with uprightness, Wesleyan in its tone, besides other little works, which accustom me to their way of speaking.<a name=46:6></a> It will be even better, I think, that you should be a little settled, and should look round you a bit before I come.<a name=46:7></a> I could not be sure of the time, for this is a long task which I have undertaken, but a very needful work, and one most useful to me, for I am perfecting myself in Hebrew, and in knowledge of the Bible in detail.<a name=46:8></a> Meanwhile, write to me when I may come, and I hope our good and faithful God will shew me the time when I ought to come, if such is His will.<a name=46:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I am always in danger of attempting too much, and as they say, "He who grasps all loses all.<a name=46:10></a>" I do what I do imperfectly -- alas, not even that -- but all the more I expect and hope for guidance from God, and do what I have to do today.<a name=46:11></a>

		Dear Mrs.<a name=47:1></a> Walter, -- I should never, and never have, as you know, pressed any to baptise their children, or introduced the subject.<a name=47:2></a> Indeed, while fully recognising it as a christian ordinance, I am disposed to think that it is in scripture, for our present condition, purposely left in the background.<a name=47:3></a> While eternal life and union with Christ are fixed and sure in Him, the ordering of all on earth till Christ comes, and even then, is provisional; not that we have not duties in the state of things we are in; duties belong to that: but the ordering of things passes.<a name=47:4></a> We have a kingdom that cannot be moved, eternal life, membership of Christ; but this in actual full possession is to come, and what we have now, even of divine ordinances, is passing.<a name=47:5></a> But I repeat, our duties are now.<a name=47:6></a> I shall only therefore present to you what scripture affords me on the subject, for if ever I hesitated, and, like others, I was exercised about it, I have NO doubt as to infant baptism of the children of a Christian.<a name=47:7></a> But I have a full feeling that Christ did not send me to baptise; I leave to others activities on either side.<a name=47:8></a> The twelve were sent to baptise, but as to ecclesiastical matters, we are under Paul.<a name=47:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This for such questions is an all-important remark, because the commission to the Gentiles (on which you and all Baptists rest) was given up by the leading apostles into his hands.<a name=47:10></a> But in general he, and he only, taught what the Church was, and it is on that ground we are.<a name=47:11></a> Further remark, the commission to the twelve was not from heaven, nor consequently immediately connecting with heaven, but from Galilee, and a commission to bring the nations into connection with an accepted remnant of Jews on earth -- not to bring Jew and Gentile into the body in an ascended Christ, which was Paul's commission especially, preaching withal reconciliation from heaven to every creature under it.<a name=47:12></a> His original commission is remarkable in this respect.<a name=47:13></a> A heavenly Christ was revealed to him -- "delivering [separating] thee from the people and from the Gentiles, to whom now I send thee.<a name=47:14></a>" He belonged neither to Jew nor Gentile in his service, but to heaven.<a name=47:15></a> Hence he in baptism knows nothing but baptising to death to all man is, and at the utmost resurrection with Christ into a new state of things.<a name=47:16></a> With Peter it is: you have crucified Christ, God has raised and exalted Him.<a name=47:17></a> Hence they were to repent and be baptised for the remission of sins, and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.<a name=47:18></a> Nor does he even go to our death with Christ, or our resurrection with Him.<a name=47:19></a> Nay, in Acts 3 he proposes to the Jews to repent, and Jesus would be sent back, and the people would be blessed by the times of refreshing of which the prophets had spoken.<a name=47:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will say: This is a long story on what is simple; but it is on the mission of the twelve you found your doctrine.<a name=47:21></a> That was only to disciple Gentile nations and baptise them.<a name=47:22></a> Of the carrying out of this we have no account in scripture: the nearest to it is in Mark, the last verse.<a name=47:23></a> But we have an enlarged account of Paul's taking their place; and it is remarkable that Roman Catholics and Puseyites all rest on the commission to the twelve, not on that to Paul.<a name=47:24></a> But where in Mark baptism is spoken of it is upon wholly another ground: "he that believeth and is baptised, shall be saved.<a name=47:25></a>" It was the gospel to a lost world, to every creature, and if a man believed and was baptised, he was saved.<a name=47:26></a> It concerns a heathen or a Jew confessing Christ, who before did not, and what is called joining Christians, and as "with the heart man believeth unto righteousness" so "with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.<a name=47:27></a>" Here it had a saving force founded on faith, but that is not the question now.<a name=47:28></a> No one can in this sense say a man is saved by baptism, but that is the only use of it in Mark.<a name=47:29></a> The Campbellites have this view of it as an ordinance, but with grievous errors, and false in itself, as man's act and not as becoming a Christian.<a name=47:30></a> Further remark, that the hundred and twenty first formed into the Church by the coming of the Holy Ghost, or, at any rate, the twelve, were never baptised.<a name=47:31></a> I know it is said they had John's baptism, and no doubt rightly, some certainly, and all with little doubt; but that was the opposite of christian baptism.<a name=47:32></a> It was to receive Christ; christian baptism is to His death -- to a rejected Christ as such at God's right hand; and one baptised with John baptism had to be baptised again, as in Acts 19.<a name=47:33></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The command was to baptise, not to be baptised, and this makes all the difference.<a name=47:34></a> It is not an act of obedience, in this the scripture is quite clear.<a name=47:35></a> Acts 8.<a name=47:36></a> (verse 37 is not genuine<a href="#47:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>), he says, "what doth hinder me to be baptised?<a name=47:37></a>" it was a privilege to be obtained; but the words do not allow the idea of obedience, but exclude it.<a name=47:38></a> So Acts 10, 47, "can any man forbid water?<a name=47:39></a>" -- a privilege, no idea of obedience, but an admission into the christian estate consequent on the proof that God would have him: and indeed it would be cruel to make it a matter of obedience, as no man can fulfil it; another must do it for him.<a name=47:40></a> The admission to a privilege cannot be a matter of obedience, though obedience gives privileges as such.<a name=47:41></a> But the real point is, the passages prove that it was the act of the baptiser, not of the baptised.<a name=47:42></a> And this changes its whole nature.<a name=47:43></a> It is said, Where are children commanded to receive baptism?<a name=47:44></a> of course they are not, nor believers.<a name=47:45></a> Ordinances are never the subject of commands.<a name=47:46></a> They are ordained and rightly used, but never obedience in him who profits by them; it would deny the very nature of Christianity, and destroy the blessing for him who partakes of it.<a name=47:47></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another important principle destroyed by the Baptist system is the existence of a divinely instituted place in which blessing is, independently of the question of personal conversion, and to which responsibility is attached according to the blessing: as the olive tree in Romans, whose branches are broken off and grafted in again or replaced by others who are broken off afterwards, branches where the root and fatness of the olive tree is, yet they come to nothing; so Hebrews 6, 10.<a name=47:48></a> So 1 Corinthians 10, where the sacraments, so-called, are shewn to be the ground of this in Christendom, and so the house in 1 Corinthians 3, where wood, hay and stubble are built in with false doctrines, but it is God's building.<a name=47:49></a> And in 1 Peter 4: 17 judgment was to begin at the house of God, alluding to Ezekiel.<a name=47:50></a> So we see it as a principle in Romans 3: "What advantage then hath the Jew?<a name=47:51></a> .<a name=47:52></a>.<a name=47:53></a>.<a name=47:54></a> much every way.<a name=47:55></a>" But he was condemned, not converted.<a name=47:56></a> So the wicked servant who ate and drank with the drunken: was "that servant" the same as the faithful one and Christ his Lord?<a name=47:57></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another principle used by Baptists is that it is a formal testimony to what a person has already.<a name=47:58></a> This is quite unscriptural.<a name=47:59></a> We are baptised <i>to</i> death -- not because we have died -- rise therein, if I bring in resurrection: it saves us, says Peter -- is not used as a witness of being saved.<a name=47:60></a> "Arise and be baptised (says Ananias) and wash away thy sins," not in confession that thy sins are washed away.<a name=47:61></a> Thus the whole system of Baptists I find to be unscriptural.<a name=47:62></a> It is not obedience: that the Baptist brethren now admit: it is not testimony to what we have.<a name=47:63></a> The apostles were not baptised, but the twelve were sent to baptise the Gentiles, being themselves received by Christ.<a name=47:64></a> Paul was not sent to do it at all, though he was formally sent, from and by a heavenly Christ, to the Gentiles by a new commission, the leaders of the twelve giving theirs up and going to the circumcision.<a name=47:65></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What is it then?<a name=47:66></a> A formal admission into the place of privilege.<a name=47:67></a> Water cannot be refused to Cornelius: nothing hindered the treasurer of Candace from being baptised.<a name=47:68></a> 1 Corinthians 10 clearly shews that it is the admission into public outward association with God, as when Israel crossed the Red Sea, as the Lord's supper is a sign and expression of food and drink in the desert.<a name=47:69></a> It is not a sign even of life -- not of being baptised into Christ's body, nor of being made children.<a name=47:70></a> In Paul's teaching it is death; in Peter or Ananias, saving, washing away sins, as a sign, a passing from the state of sinful man into the place where God's privileges were, specially the presence of the Holy Ghost, who is among the saints in God's house as Satan is in the world.<a name=47:71></a> Paul in Titus 3 recognises the same truth.<a name=47:72></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The question then is, are children entitled to be received?<a name=47:73></a> are believers?<a name=47:74></a> Believers, clearly, <i>if they have not yet been</i>; if they have, they cannot be again.<a name=47:75></a> But supposing they have not, they are clearly received by baptism; and, in an ordinary way, at the beginning, those in received the Holy Ghost, as said in Acts 2, and may be seen in Acts 8.<a name=47:76></a> Can children, or are they to be left out where Satan rules?<a name=47:77></a> Scripture, I believe, gives a Christian parent a title to bring them to Christ, but this can only be now scripturally by death as baptism figures it, for "that which is born of the flesh is flesh.<a name=47:78></a>" <i>If</i> baptism be the reception of children where the Holy Ghost is, and where they can be brought up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, and taught to obey, which till they are Christians as to position they cannot be, the question is, Is a christian parent obliged to leave his child outside with the devil, or allowed to bring him in where the Holy Ghost and the care of God's house is?<a name=47:79></a> Scripture tells one that children of a christian parent are holy, have a right to be admitted, are not as children of a Jew who had married a Gentile unclean, that is, unfit to be admitted among God's people, but holy.<a name=47:80></a> I know it is said the husband was so too.<a name=47:81></a> It is not true where the sense is looked to, The Jewish husband was profaned not profane, could not be profaned if he had been: it is what is holy that is profaned, nothing else can be.<a name=47:82></a> Now it is grace, and the unbeliever is "sanctified," not holy; the child is "holy".<a name=47:83></a> The Lord Himself has said, "Of such is the kingdom of heaven.<a name=47:84></a>" It is said, Why not give them the Lord's supper?<a name=47:85></a> Because that is the sign of the unity of the body, and it is the baptism of the Holy Ghost that forms that.<a name=47:86></a> Baptists always reason instead of going to scripture.<a name=47:87></a> I have no difficulty with Baptists who think they have never been baptised; of course they ought to be.<a name=47:88></a> They have never been <i>regularly</i> admitted among Christians on earth; they may be of the body (as Cornelius) by the baptism of the Holy Ghost, but they have never been <i>formally</i> admitted to the house on earth, the place where the Holy Ghost dwells.<a name=47:89></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This answers another question you put -- the converted and unconverted being baptised together.<a name=47:90></a> If it is admission into the house they are all admitted together, cannot be on any different principle.<a name=47:91></a> If it be obedience, then indeed there is; but scripture is in the teeth of this: to separate them would be to deny the principle on which any are baptised at all.<a name=47:92></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I respect the conscience of a Baptist; I repeat, if he think he never has been baptised he ought to be, but it is as clear to me as the day that his principles are totally unscriptural.<a name=47:93></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nothing can be clearer then, that in the New Testament it is <i>never</i> treated as obedience.<a name=47:94></a> If it were, we were saved by our own obedience, have our sins washed away by our own obedience; for this is what is said of baptism.<a name=47:95></a> I understand quite well that a heathen coming to baptism does administratively receive the remission of his sins: every one is baptised to it.<a name=47:96></a> I understand too that one who has been as a heathen and converted coming to the faith -- to such it is practically a first confession of Christ and that they are very happy -- but obedience of a believer to an ordinance is all wrong from beginning to end; as to the Lord's supper as well as baptism.<a name=47:97></a> If a man think it is -- I do not blame him for doing it, but it is wholly unintelligent.<a name=47:98></a> If a friend was to say, keep this in remembrance of me, and I said, I will do what you bid me, my friend would have no thanks to give me.<a name=47:99></a> The gift was not valued.<a name=47:100></a> You see it is a wide subject, but the great principle is that the children of a christian parent are holy; and so far from children being unfit subjects, "of such is the kingdom of <i>heaven</i>" -- not Christ's, note, on earth.<a name=47:101></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The truth Baptists have to learn is that there is a place, a system established by God, where the blessings are found -- the olive-tree fatness -- without the question of conversion being settled, in which heathen, Mohammedans, and now for a time Jews are not, but in which these last will hereafter again be, though not on our footing.<a name=47:102></a> I know it is said you are bringing us back to Judaism.<a name=47:103></a> I answer, in this respect the apostle does in 1 Corinthians 10 and Romans 11: and baptism does not refer to the body with which they had nothing to do, nor to giving life (which, if they had, was not brought to light, and they had it only in the state of servants), but the dwelling-place of God, which they were then, which Christendom is now, and according to which, or as which, it will be judged -- a very weighty consideration.<a name=47:104></a> All is so in confusion that this house is hard to own, but that does not alter the truth of scripture.<a name=47:105></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A word as to the place of parents; God has given them children; but "that which is born of the flesh is flesh.<a name=47:106></a>" But the love of God is trusted, and the grace of Christ who receives such, and also the word believed that blessing is there where God has placed it.<a name=47:107></a> They cannot leave their children without in Satan's world; they bring them to be received as holy, as regards God's ways and dealings.<a name=47:108></a> The Church cannot receive them but through death, but receives them in Christ's name as if receiving Him, as He says, and the name of Jesus is called upon them through this image of His death too; and while received into God's congregation where the Holy Ghost is, and where all should be a pattern to them, they are given back to the parents in grace with Jesus' name on them to bring them up for Him, not for the world, "in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.<a name=47:109></a>" I receive them then because they are holy relatively, because Christ received them, and "of such is the kingdom of heaven," and I can receive them in no other scriptural way -- with the sign of Christ's death and of His love.<a name=47:110></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have no objection to any one reading this letter, but .<a name=47:111></a>.<a name=47:112></a>.<a name=47:113></a> it is not the time to occupy the church with ordinances.<a name=47:114></a>

		[R T Grant] BELOVED BROTHER, -- .<a name=52:1></a>.<a name=52:2></a>.<a name=52:3></a> I quite feel what you say of the work, and when it is not mere evangelising it will ever be a certain isolation.<a name=52:4></a> I remember shocking an excellent sister some thirty years ago by saying, that as one went on one would always feel more alone, be more isolated.<a name=52:5></a> So it was with Paul, even as is easily seen: yea, so it was with the blessed Lord Himself, always alone, and more and more isolated as He went on.<a name=52:6></a> So He said at first, "Blessed are ye poor" (always true) -- at last, "Ye shall leave me alone.<a name=52:7></a>" But one has to watch it.<a name=52:8></a> Faith is never alone; and as fruit Paul had his Timothy: yea, even the Lord -- John nearer to Him than others; though with Him the Father must be all.<a name=52:9></a> And when driven out from Judea by the jealousy of the people, it was just then to see the fields white for harvest.<a name=52:10></a> And what the word says when this isolation and perception of failure is strongest: "Be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God.<a name=52:11></a>" "For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.<a name=52:12></a>" Not of ardent Peter, but of beloved John, it was said, "If I will that he tarry till I come," and we have to take the place God has put us in.<a name=52:13></a> I envy the evangelists sometimes, and feel they are better than I, but accept, perhaps as coming from my fault, the place I am in.<a name=52:14></a> But I feel, though evangelising heartily all I can, I live for the Church, whatever place God gives me -- none if He so wills.<a name=52:15></a> It is His, and that is right.<a name=52:16></a> I feel too I am growing old, but in itself that is a pleasure -- our salvation nearer than when we believed.<a name=52:17></a> In a day or two I am in my seventieth year.<a name=52:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think you ought to rest, but if you must, it is also good in every way to change the scene we are in if God allow it.<a name=52:19></a> We see the work more as a whole with God, and even the details, and for ourselves the spirit is relieved from the pressure of responsibility as to details.<a name=52:20></a> Paul got this by prison: of that perhaps we are not worthy.<a name=52:21></a> I may be in London ere very long, though not just yet, but I could run over hence if you were there, and I will in England be your Timothy.<a name=52:22></a> I have Italy to go to if the Lord will, and desired work in Pau, but this left to the Lord, or I should be oppressed with too much on my hands.<a name=52:23></a> Whose hands?<a name=52:24></a> What poor creatures we are, and what can we do!<a name=52:25></a> I was myself really ill with fatigue, my pulse stopping dead for almost half a minute and then fluttering ever so fast; but it was only being used up, and God provided a day's rest, and I set off, travelled all night, and began our Vigan meeting at nine, and got better by resting an hour daily when possible all through the meeting.<a name=52:26></a> The Lord has made me work at these conferences; Geneva, Valence, Vigan, a day at Vergze, Zurich, Stuttgart.<a name=52:27></a> They needed some teaching and getting into <i>practically</i> deeper water.<a name=52:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We were, all through, mainly on being dead with Christ, surely a most weighty point, on which all Paul's Christianity rests practically.<a name=52:29></a> It has connected itself in my mind with closing responsibility, with the death (for faith) first of the evil nature, and opening into the development of privilege, when God's righteousness is revealed, but given us and in God's purpose before the world, for His delight was in the sons of men -- wonderful thought!<a name=52:30></a> Then, His Son become man but in connection with responsibility rejected -- that, for the full glory of God, met in His death, and so the glory and privileges brought out.<a name=52:31></a> But there man is treated as dead "in" sins, not "to," as in Romans (in Colossians both, and man raised, not sitting in heavenly places), and it is a new creation and all God's work.<a name=52:32></a> The realisation is in 2 Corinthians 4, and indeed 5 as effect.<a name=52:33></a> All this marks wonderful perfection in the ways of God as to responsibility and purpose.<a name=52:34></a> Our responsibility, so brought to God, is in Ephesians 4: 5, "imitators of God, as dear children": in connection with Romans, the commandment of chapter 12.<a name=52:35></a>

		You will find no epistle where courage is looked for in the Lord's workmen so much as in 2 Timothy, exactly where all was in ruin.<a name=52:36></a> The Lord's strength never fails, and we have to work on in that with the patience and grace that He alone can give, and looking to Him who alone can give result to our labour for good.<a name=52:37></a> Remember, beloved brother, if your heart fails at all in seeing yourself hindered in work, that the gracious hand of God is in it, and He makes all things work together for good to those that love Him.<a name=52:38></a> I rejoice to think you are in His gracious hands, and fully trust we shall see you better.<a name=52:39></a>

		Dear -- , -- You may put any letters you like to "James.<a name=55:13></a>"<a href="#55:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> I rather dislike dialogues as fictitious, but they serve to bring out truth in many cases better as a kind of parable, so to speak.<a name=55:14></a> Still I am hardly satisfied .<a name=55:15></a>.<a name=55:16></a>.<a name=55:17></a> .<a name=55:18></a> The importance of judging church history, or the state it reveals, is daily more apparent to me.<a name=55:19></a> I am not at the bottom of it, but the change from scripture to prelacy, succession of bishops, so-called, has something mysterious in it, along with the fabrication of Ignatius, and perhaps Apostolic Constitutions, which are, I believe, heretical in their present state -- a prelacy which is the basis of all subsequent Christendom till the Reformation, and now of high church, and even all clerical systems.<a name=55:20></a> But one thing is clear, that all refer to Peter for the system, not one to Paul.<a name=55:21></a> The unity of the church as they view it is always based on him; Paul at best only comes in by the bye, swamped in Peter at Rome.<a name=55:22></a> And even as to detail, the rising up of scriptural conscience against image worship and evil was from Paul's writings, and the authors of it, called Paulicians.<a name=55:23></a> They had only his writings and the gospels -- but this by the bye.<a name=55:24></a> This system presses stronger on me than even infidelity, dreadful as it is individually.<a name=55:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the gospels and translation, I must leave it over to God: they want to get a French Old Testament and new edition of New; and I have here the Old on hand -- the historical part easy, the prophets often difficult, the Psalms done.<a name=55:26></a> I should be glad of a little quiet, but I have felt I must do the day's work, and leave the rest to God, for Italy is before me too.<a name=55:27></a> I am expected, but in no hurry.<a name=55:28></a> I have thought to run to England when finished here, or before if necessary .<a name=55:29></a>.<a name=55:30></a>.<a name=55:31></a> .<a name=55:32></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		When I speak of church history, the word is quite enough for me, but the origin of an immense system calling itself the church, is of interest.<a name=55:36></a> It may be the Lord meant it to be concealed, that now we might judge by the word: in that I have no difficulty.<a name=55:37></a>

		[H M Hooke] BELOVED BROTHER, -- I thank you for your letter, and thank you for the account of the work.<a name=64:1></a> Canada is dear to me for the work's sake, and for the affection of so very many from whom I have received every sort of kindness, beloved ones in the Lord.<a name=64:2></a> When I have laboured in a place I always feel it mine, not in possession, but in the service I have to render to the saints.<a name=64:3></a> I have a faint hope, but wait on the Lord as to it, of getting to the Guelph meeting.<a name=64:4></a> I should be glad to see them once more, but as I have told some of them, I am in my seventieth year, and though through mercy strong still, we know that threescore years and ten closes the title of man's active life, though our God can do what seems Him good.<a name=64:5></a> It depends a little on my getting through the work I am about here.<a name=64:6></a> I feel how great the privilege of evangelists is.<a name=64:7></a> I preach here or in the country around regularly, speaking, unless some special hindrance, two or three times a week, but every one has to do the work and fill up the little niche assigned him by God.<a name=64:8></a> My work is more in setting souls free, and now in these last days, when all is going so fast to evil, getting, as the Lord enables me, the word of God in its contents and in its purity among those who profess His name.<a name=64:9></a> They need being built up here; the work has greatly extended.<a name=64:10></a> And besides, I have undertaken nothing less than correcting the whole Old Testament, working it from the Hebrew with all the helps I can.<a name=64:11></a> It is a service underground, but I trust will be a help to the saints.<a name=64:12></a> They were really without an Old Testament -- either an excessively incorrect one, or by infidel translators.<a name=64:13></a> We have done (I have helpers for pure German) the prophets, Job, the most difficult of all, and are in good progress with other parts; the historical are very easy comparatively.<a name=64:14></a> I had done the Psalms a few years ago for them.<a name=64:15></a> I believe God is graciously helping us.<a name=64:16></a> I am very happy in the work, but a little anxious as to the time it will take.<a name=64:17></a> Then I have three gospels ready of the English New Testament, that and the French being now out of print, and the French are waiting for the English corrections.<a name=64:18></a> But if I get another gospel quite ready, I might perhaps get for a couple of months to America and return; if fine weather, it would be a rest for me, and that I somewhat want .<a name=64:19></a>.<a name=64:20></a>.<a name=64:21></a> .<a name=64:22></a> I accept my present work while it is so important in these last days that brethren should have the word of God, and that they should have it as pure as possible -- and we must expect in these days to have the poor as always when the church got into its own place in the world, at least for the great mass.<a name=64:23></a> And I feel I am serving the Lord in using the little knowledge I have of Greek and Hebrew, etc.<a name=64:24></a>, in furnishing brethren who have them not, with the word of God as nearly as possible as it is.<a name=64:25></a> Otherwise, the times call for building them up in the truth solidly as once given, so that I am jealous as to how much time I spend on what is means, however precious, for we cannot esteem the word too precious.<a name=64:26></a> It is that which God has given us when the church went wrong.<a name=64:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I rest on the Lord's goodness towards His people, though I be a poor intercessor for them.<a name=64:28></a> I feel the difference of counting on the Lord's love (that I feel through grace I can do), and using it in the activity of faith, to obtain the blessings it has in store for His people: there I feel weak.<a name=64:29></a> God will give surely according to Him own thoughts and purpose, but He allows us to have a part in carrying them out, first by prayer and then by service; and while I doubt not all is foreknown and surely ordained, and for those for whom it is prepared of the Father, yet herein comes our responsibility, the place of a single eye that does not confer with flesh and blood.<a name=64:30></a> One so wrought from the beginning, holding himself dead from that time, and always bearing about in his body the dying of the Lord Jesus.<a name=64:31></a> We, alas!<a name=64:32></a> have often to learn how to do it, or do so, at least, after much mixture of the living and the dead.<a name=64:33></a> Yet he had to be helped, and have a thorn in his flesh, and be delivered to death; but then it was from God and for Jesus' sake: the flesh was not different, but the man was.<a name=64:34></a> However, the Lord is all we need, and He is perfect.<a name=64:35></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have not doubted a sifting time would come for the work in Canada, but the workmen must not be discouraged by it.<a name=64:36></a> I doubt not there may have been some excitement and craving after it, still with self-knowledge.<a name=64:37></a> I dread excitement, but I do not forget that when the Lord sowed, only one in four came to perfection.<a name=64:38></a> I do not mean this as a rule; we do not see it thus when the apostles preached: it is danger, and characteristic, but I use it to check a false judgment upon the work, where some disappointment may come.<a name=64:39></a> I am more anxious about what the world and the spirit of it forming a clergy may do, than about the reality of what has been done.<a name=64:40></a> I know -- too, but I know the gracious Lord is above all our weakness.<a name=64:41></a> It is a great point to know how to serve in what we find, not expect all as we would.<a name=64:42></a> Christianity works with what it brings, not with what it finds; and we are poor creatures ourselves after all.<a name=64:43></a> Give my kindest love to the dear brethren, and I am, dear brother,

		[From the French] [I come now to the subject of the sufferings of Christ.<a name=68:1></a> There are persons who oppose my doctrine, by saying, 'The Lord Jesus would thus voluntarily have endured non-atoning sufferings -- sufferings which do not shelter from the wrath of God those for love of whom He endured them -- useless sufferings, which in no measure satisfy the justice of God.<a name=68:2></a>' I reply: Certainly, Christ has willingly endured non-atoning sufferings, sufferings which will not shelter those for whom He has endured them from the anger of God.<a name=68:3></a> In denying this truth you reject what is most comforting, and, next to salvation itself, that which is most precious in the gospel.<a name=68:4></a> Christ has "suffered, being tempted.<a name=68:5></a>" Now that was not expiation, neither does it preserve us from the same kind of suffering; on the contrary, it is our precious consolation, when we are tempted.<a name=68:6></a> He has endured the "contradiction of sinners against himself.<a name=68:7></a>" From that I gain courage not to grow weary in the conflict; but there is no expiation there, no delivering man from wrath.<a name=68:8></a> "If so be that we suffer with him," it is said.<a name=68:9></a> Are those atoning sufferings?<a name=68:10></a> The Lord said to two of His disciples, "Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptised withal shall ye be baptised.<a name=68:11></a>" (Mark x.<a name=68:12></a> 39.<a name=68:13></a>) Was that a question of expiation?<a name=68:14></a> Paul sought the fellowship of His sufferings, and filled up that which remained of the afflictions of Christ.<a name=68:15></a> Were these atoning sufferings?<a name=68:16></a> Some say to me, 'But these sufferings do not extend to death.<a name=68:17></a>' They are mistaken, for it is quite the opposite: "Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus .<a name=68:18></a>.<a name=68:19></a>.<a name=68:20></a> for we which live are always delivered unto death for Jesus' sake.<a name=68:21></a>" (2 Corinthians 4: 10, 11.<a name=68:22></a>) "The fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death.<a name=68:23></a>" (Philippians 3: 10.<a name=68:24></a>) These are very clear passages.<a name=68:25></a> We have only to read chapters 2, 4 of the Epistle to the Hebrews to find the plain contradiction of the doctrine which some put forth in opposition to what I have taught.<a name=68:26></a> That doctrine denies almost all of Psalm 69 and a great part of Psalm 22, where explicit distinction is made between the sufferings on the part of man, and forsaking on the part of God.<a name=68:27></a> In Gethsemane, He was not yet drinking the cup, for He asks, if it were possible, not to drink it.<a name=68:28></a> Was He not suffering?<a name=68:29></a> How can any one say that the sufferings of Christ, which do not satisfy the justice of God, were useless?<a name=68:30></a> Is His sympathy of no avail?<a name=68:31></a> Is the fact useless that He takes part in all our difficulties, in all our sorrows, in all our temptation, to know how to apply His word to him who is overwhelmed with afflictions?<a name=68:32></a> "We have not an High Priest which cannot ( mh; dunavmenon ) be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.<a name=68:33></a>" (Hebrews 4: 15; compare Hebrews 2: 17, 18.<a name=68:34></a>) But I have said enough for every Christian, who thanks the Saviour for this special manifestation of His love.<a name=68:35></a> There are sufferings of Christ, sufferings of an infinite value for us, which are not atoning.<a name=68:36></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Some have raised a special difficulty with respect to His sufferings for the remnant of Israel.<a name=68:37></a> never will I seek to turn the Christian away from the atoning sufferings of Christ, and from those which form the basis of His sympathy with us in our conflicts, to draw his attention to that which relates to the remnant of Israel.<a name=68:38></a> I desire that the Christian should occupy himself, above all, with the atonement, then with the consolations which are bestowed upon us by the knowledge of the sympathy of Him who has suffered, being tempted.<a name=68:39></a> But when it is a question of explaining the Psalms, it is necessary to speak of the sympathies of Christ for the remnant, because that is the principal subject of the Psalms.<a name=68:40></a> It is easy to understand that many souls, as dear to God as a Christian more instructed in the scriptures, know nothing of that which the word teaches on this subject.<a name=68:41></a> We should not lead the weak to doubtful disputations.<a name=68:42></a> I do not think that what I have said would do this.<a name=68:43></a> Such souls would perhaps have said, 'I understand nothing at all about it,' and would have laid the book aside, for which I should not have blamed them.<a name=68:44></a> They might have been able to enjoy it afterwards, but they would not have been troubled, if their attention had not been drawn to this point.<a name=68:45></a> Without leading them into a discussion which would not be profitable to them, I shall seek to enlighten them as to what I mean.<a name=68:46></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Every Christian believes that which I teach, although all do not apply it to the remnant of Israel.<a name=68:47></a> The position of this remnant will, in the last days, be as follows: They will see before them the anger of God and will be in anguish, feeling how much they have deserved it; the power of Satan will be there in an entirely special manner; the mass of the people will be upraised against this remnant.<a name=68:48></a> Christ has passed through these troubles, although He did not deserve to do so, but He has felt how much His beloved people have merited these troubles.<a name=68:49></a> He has accomplished atonement for Israel in such a manner that, finally, the wrath of God will not burst forth against the remnant of this people; this remnant will enjoy blessing.<a name=68:50></a> But He has passed through the troubles above mentioned.<a name=68:51></a> The wrath of God was before His face, the power of Satan was there, it was the hour of the wicked and the power of darkness.<a name=68:52></a> It is said in the word, "In all their affliction he was afflicted" (Isaiah 63: 9), and I believe it is not there a question of expiation.<a name=68:53></a> In Gethsemane, He was not yet drinking the cup, but His "soul was exceeding sorrowful, even unto death.<a name=68:54></a>" All this appears to me very simple and very certain, according to the word.<a name=68:55></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Difficulties have also been raised with regard to the idea that this took place particularly after the last supper.<a name=68:56></a> But the distinction of that hour is made in the word.<a name=68:57></a> "His hour," it is often said, "was not yet come.<a name=68:58></a>" Afterwards the Saviour Himself denotes this special time.<a name=68:59></a> He said to His apostles, "When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing?<a name=68:60></a> And they said, Nothing.<a name=68:61></a> Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it .<a name=68:62></a>.<a name=68:63></a>.<a name=68:64></a> .<a name=68:65></a> For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors.<a name=68:66></a>" (Luke 22: 35-37) He would not drink any more with His disciples of the wine of the passover.<a name=68:67></a> Then, this was the hour of His anguish.<a name=68:68></a> Does any one believe that He did not suffer from the forsaking of His disciples, the treason of Judas, the denial of Peter?<a name=68:69></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To the thought that this kind of suffering continued till death, special objections have been made.<a name=68:70></a> But Psalms 69: 22, are witnesses of it.<a name=68:71></a> Without doubt, the cup of the wrath of God has, so to speak, comparatively effaced all the rest; but it is no less true that these Psalms, of which we have the literal accomplishment in the Gospels, depict sufferings of Christ on the part of men even unto death, and shew that He has felt them.<a name=68:72></a> "Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none.<a name=68:73></a> They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.<a name=68:74></a>" (Psalm 69: 20, 21.<a name=68:75></a>) Read Psalm 22: 14-20, and remark the contrast between these sufferings and the forsaking of God.<a name=68:76></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have already seen that Paul sought the fellowship of the sufferings of the Saviour in death.<a name=68:77></a> That Christ was then occupied with Israel, is brought out evidently by His words, "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do": an intercession which gave force to the call to repentance addressed to Israel by Peter: "I wot that through ignorance ye did it.<a name=68:78></a>" The fact that the remnant of Israel go to the edge of the tomb in their anguish is constantly repeated in the word.<a name=68:79></a> Further, the application of the sympathy of Christ to Israel is only a particular application of a general truth of which I have already spoken.<a name=68:80></a> It is also clearly set forth in the word, that Satan came to try Jesus in a special manner.<a name=68:81></a> In the Gospel of Luke, it is said, that Satan "departed from him <i>for a season</i>.<a name=68:82></a>" The Lord declares emphatically, in alluding to His last sufferings unto death, "The prince of this world cometh.<a name=68:83></a>" Dreadful words!<a name=68:84></a> It was the hour of man, of the Jews, and the power of darkness.<a name=68:85></a> I say no more; I do not enter into controversy.<a name=68:86></a> It seems to me that what I have said will be received by every true Christian.<a name=68:87></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I seek not to go deeply into the question here, but to present the truth which is found in the word in such a manner that the weakest Christian may see that what I have said is scriptural.<a name=68:88></a> I do not think that the church of God ought to be deprived of the value of these precious facts.<a name=68:89></a> The more we see that atonement was made in drinking the cup of wrath, the better we shall comprehend what sin really is, and what deliverance is.<a name=68:90></a> The more also will be brought out the reality of those sufferings of Christ which are not expiatory, and Christ Himself will become more precious.<a name=68:91></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have endeavoured to present my thoughts in such a manner as to wound nobody, and to avoid controversy.<a name=68:92></a> Whatever effects the opinions which are opposed to my teaching have produced in my own mind, I have taken care not to express them in the least.<a name=68:93></a> I seek, and that by request of others, to calm all anxiety which the suspicion of grave errors might have produced.<a name=68:94></a> "The fruit of righteousness is sown in peace.<a name=68:95></a>" .<a name=68:96></a>.<a name=68:97></a>.<a name=68:98></a> It seems to me that sincere souls might find edification in what I have written, and not objections only.<a name=68:99></a> I am not senseless enough to maintain that a pen, purely human and feeble, may not have expressed itself badly on such subjects; but I see nothing at all to retract from the statements themselves.<a name=68:100></a> I believe, on the contrary, that the Christian may learn in them better to lay hold on the whole extend of the sufferings of Christ, the reality of His humanity, and the infinite depth of His love.<a name=68:101></a>]<br>1864.<a name=68:102></a>

		[G Biava] [From the Italian.<a name=72:1></a>] DEAR BROTHER, -- I delayed writing to you until I had read a little of the "Dispensatore," and I had very little time.<a name=72:2></a> I am well satisfied on the whole, and I believe, dear brother, that God has guided you.<a name=72:3></a> The articles are simple, and at the same time sufficiently advanced in the truth.<a name=72:4></a> I hope you will always keep before the eyes and the hearts of the Italians foundation truths; grace, salvation, redemption, the perfection of the work of Christ; that redemption was completed in His death; and that, in His resurrection, we have not only a new hope, but a new position before God.<a name=72:5></a> This gives perfect peace before God, and this is the measure of our walk in the world.<a name=72:6></a> What Christ is before God is what we are, because we are in Him; but if we are in Him, He is in us, and His life ought to be manifested in all our ways.<a name=72:7></a> I find much to interest me in these numbers, but I speak only of the articles which suggested some observations.<a name=72:8></a> Although it is useful to insist on the necessity of having an assembly pure, and of keeping it pure (and I believe this is necessary everywhere, and especially in Italy), I hope you will not go further in speaking of the questions which have risen up amongst brethren.<a name=72:9></a> Do not think that I am less strong in my conviction of the necessity for firmness; I am far from being so, but your "Dispensatore" is intended for edification, and for the growth of souls; and I believe that firmness is better manifested in practice where God is with us, when principles have been presented and proved, than in a multitude of words, which give rise to controversy.<a name=72:10></a> I must also point out a few little points, and say a word on the source from which you take the articles (I speak only of the defects) so that your paper may be as perfect as possible.<a name=72:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In No.<a name=72:12></a> 1 the principles of the article are very good, but I do not think that a person can believe that he has peace before feeling it, because peace is a state of the soul; it is something experienced.<a name=72:13></a> I can believe that Christ has made peace, but not that I have it.<a name=72:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In No.<a name=72:15></a> 2 page 2.<a name=72:16></a> Here also the article is very interesting, and the principles are true, but I do not think that "united to God" is according to the word.<a name=72:17></a> We are united to Christ.<a name=72:18></a> I do not believe that faith unites us to Christ: the Holy Ghost does.<a name=72:19></a> Many people say that faith unites, but the word does not.<a name=72:20></a> "By one Spirit are we baptised into one body.<a name=72:21></a>" "He that is joined to the Lord is one spirit.<a name=72:22></a>" I could not say (end of the second), 'not by preaching the law.<a name=72:23></a>' I acknowledge that the gospel, or Christ, is a better way, but for many hearts, or rather for many consciences, the law is a means of reaching them, and convincing them of sin: certainly it cannot give life or peace.<a name=72:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I cannot find it just now, but I think you have spoken as if the Old Testament saints could have been united to Christ.<a name=72:25></a> They had received life from the Son of God; but union depends upon the coming of the Holy Ghost.<a name=72:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One observation more.<a name=72:27></a> You ought to examine attentively (I ask God to guide you in this) the articles on repentance, and on sanctification.<a name=72:28></a> I do not speak about these, but I think you translate much of what dear -- has written; you do well, for his writings are most useful, and they attract the heart, and are much more easily understood than my own.<a name=72:29></a> But amongst our brethren, and in a whole school of Christians, on account of the war they have made against the error which requires so much repentance before believing, and coming to Jesus, and so much sanctification before knowing that we are in Christ, they have fallen a little into the other extreme; they will have no other repentance but faith itself, and no other sanctification but the fact of being in Christ, who is our sanctification.<a name=72:30></a> I do not say that your article on repentance is like this.<a name=72:31></a> But the one on sanctification does not seem to me quite clear.<a name=72:32></a> It is true that Christ has been given to us, made of God sanctification, and it is true that no human efforts can add to sanctification; but though on one side the life given by God is holy -- Christ is our life -- it is not the whole truth that we are accounted holy in Him.<a name=72:33></a> It is evident that the writer loves holiness, but the word speaks of following holiness (Hebrews 12: 14): it says, "The very God of peace sanctify you wholly.<a name=72:34></a>" 'The sanctification that I have in Christ is as perfect as the wisdom and righteousness.<a name=72:35></a>' But the righteousness is always perfect as my righteousness; I possess it, and so I am the righteousness of God in Him.<a name=72:36></a> Could I say I am holiness, or I possess perfect holiness?<a name=72:37></a> God sees me in Christ perfectly righteous; He sees me, we can say, perfectly sanctified -- granted -- but, as to righteousness, there is no other righteousness before God but Christ.<a name=72:38></a> If I could have any other righteousness, I would not wish to have it; but I do desire holiness; I follow after holiness: could I follow after righteousness?<a name=72:39></a> God chastens us that we may be partakers of His holiness; this could not be said of His righteousness.<a name=72:40></a> There is, thus, a difference between sanctification and righteousness, although we have both in Christ.<a name=72:41></a> We are, as to our persons, sanctified in Christ, since we have the new life; but our state of soul may be bad or good, and we ought to follow holiness.<a name=72:42></a> If this be done before knowing the perfect righteousness of God, before being justified and knowing it, we are not really seeking sanctification, but justification, hoping that if we were more holy God would accept us.<a name=72:43></a> There is no true holiness until we have peace; after we get peace, holiness for its own sake is the desire of the soul.<a name=72:44></a> We must certainly first of all go to Christ, that is not the question, but what we are to do when we have gone to Him, and have found peace.<a name=72:45></a> That we have received an entirely new life, which ought to be developed, and the activities of the heart in prayer, in the use of the means given by God, are things often forgotten when sanctification is spoken of.<a name=72:46></a> In your article, the second part makes it evident that the writer desires the yoke of Christ, and brokenness of will, but the doctrine is not entirely clear.<a name=72:47></a> I say all this, dear brother, that your "Dispensatore" may be as useful as possible.<a name=72:48></a> The greater number of Christians will not observe these little mistakes in it; they will even be glad to find them, and will not consider them to be mistakes, the doctrine as to sanctification excepted .<a name=72:49></a>.<a name=72:50></a>.<a name=72:51></a> .<a name=72:52></a>

		W Kelly, Immortality<a href="#75:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> is incorruptibility, and applies to the body in life and immortality, nor is mortality applied to anything but the body.<a name=75:1></a> The evil is that people confound immortality and eternal life -- two things totally distinct.<a name=75:2></a> I am just as mortal when I have it as before.<a name=75:3></a> They must for their theory make Satan mortal as man.<a name=75:4></a> I am not very fond of the expression "immortality of the soul," as it gives a handle to them.<a name=75:5></a> Man is become mortal or under liability to die, but scripture is as plain as possible and as express, that death does not touch the soul.<a name=75:6></a> It is the separation of soul and body, or, as the second death, punishment.<a name=75:7></a> These things have vogue for a time with unconverted and unstable souls, and some other heresy springs up; but it is when God calls us to it to be earnestly contended against.<a name=75:8></a>

		[To the same.<a name=76:1></a>] Dearest W Kelly, -- The great book on the subject is an American, which I have in a measure looked at when there, having to meet them; but found it best to trust the Lord and have scripture ready, through grace, and meet what I had to meet, and the Lord helped me.<a name=76:2></a> Some were delivered, and one, through mercy, kept safe.<a name=76:3></a> Birks is pretty much, as to the ground he takes, Origen's; that God had not revealed all the truth, but kept some back that useful terror might be there.<a name=76:4></a> But there is another question, What is the truth of what is revealed?<a name=76:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I find gross ignorance of the gospel at the bottom of all this.<a name=76:6></a> Christians are put by Birks as having to answer for their works, and receive the things done in the body just if there was no complete salvation.<a name=76:7></a> Give an account of ourselves we shall; christian responsibility I fully acknowledge.<a name=76:8></a> But they leave out divine righteousness and a new position consequent on redemption.<a name=76:9></a> They leave us under our old Adam responsibility with a supplement of grace.<a name=76:10></a> They confound the wrath which judges temporally with the wrath of God revealed from heaven; our responsibility as men and our totally lost estate in nature.<a name=76:11></a> It is not only that we shall not come into judgment because Christ has borne our sins as to our own responsibility as men, but that we are passed from death unto life.<a name=76:12></a> This leaves the ordinary evangelical world, though they may be kept in simplicity by mercy, wholly incapable of meeting these questions.<a name=76:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The question besides the atonement is, Is the soul immortal according to scripture?<a name=76:14></a> and the distinct holding fast that death is not ceasing to exist, on which scripture is quite plain.<a name=76:15></a> Another point is that while God is love, He is perfectly righteous in His horror of sin.<a name=76:16></a> Generally these persons mean by righteous that He is under obligation to us, which is a very different [thing] from a holy nature expressed in power and authority against sin.<a name=76:17></a> But the atonement always goes when this doctrine is let in, and it must do so.<a name=76:18></a> As to details, they see nothing of the earthly judgments of the Old Testament; this clear, nine-tenths of their proofs are gone.<a name=76:19></a> All is hodge-podge in their minds (and in such as Birks') as to the difference of judgments of man here on earth, and wrath, as referred to man's being hatred against God, revealed from heaven.<a name=76:20></a> When death, destruction, and the like in the Old Testament are taken in their true sense, most of what they say falls away as without any force whatever; but here the evangelicals lay themselves wholly open to their attacks.<a name=76:21></a> Solemn intimations may be found which the spiritual mind may apprehend, but the dealings of God were on the ground of present judgment.<a name=76:22></a> So on the other side, though there were hints, life and incorruptibility were brought to light by the gospel.<a name=76:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am drawing fast to a close with my own work here, and what we are now doing is very easy.<a name=76:24></a> I am only afraid of going too fast.<a name=76:25></a> I have no doubt I shall find defects, but the poor brethren will have an Old Testament they can use, which at present is not the case.<a name=76:26></a> English, Dutch and Italians are far better off, the last the best of all old translations -- Zurich not bad.<a name=76:27></a>

		MY DEAR BROTHER, -- The denial of the immortality of the soul upsets the atonement entirely.<a name=77:1></a> If I have only an animal soul, where is responsibility?<a name=77:2></a> I put the case to them, Could God give eternal life to a dog They said, Yes.<a name=77:3></a> Then I said, It is a new creation, but be it so.<a name=77:4></a> But could the dog feel responsible for what he had done as a dog, as sin Would Christ have to die for his sins when he was such.<a name=77:5></a> If not, He has not to do it for mine when at best, if more intelligent, I had only an animal soul.<a name=77:6></a> I repent for the same reason of all my past life -- out of the question if I have no such spiritual responsible soul.<a name=77:7></a> And even if my sins only deserved a temporary punishment as particular acts, Christ's sorrows and sufferings must be proportionally small.<a name=77:8></a> If it be a spiritual nature which is at enmity against God, as the apostle states, then I understand the extent of the evil, and a misery which no mere quantum of infliction could reach.<a name=77:9></a> The atonement must be measured by the extend and nature of the guilt, taking in Him against whom we have sinned.<a name=77:10></a> If a person were merely puzzled by some clever person I might have patience in hope of restoration, but when a man is a heretic, that is, holds it so that it is the expression of sin in the flesh, he is to be rejected.<a name=77:11></a> I never met a person who held it deliberately who did not lose the atonement; as it indeed cannot be otherwise, for when there is not an immortal soul, a spiritual soul, how can you make an animal morally responsible?<a name=77:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards the Person of Christ, it is thus I have seen it work in America.<a name=77:13></a> They teach that death is ceasing to exist.<a name=77:14></a> If it be, either Christ has not died for us, or He ceased to exist.<a name=77:15></a> Thus His person was speedily lost; but all have not gone thus far.<a name=77:16></a> Some did distinctly state it to me.<a name=77:17></a> If it has practically taken the form of a heresy, we are told to reject them; and certainly what destroys the atonement is not the portion of a happy worshipper.<a name=77:18></a> They are not on Christian ground: the Lord's supper has not the same sense as it has for me .<a name=77:19></a>.<a name=77:20></a>.<a name=77:21></a> .<a name=77:22></a>

		F G Patterson, One great cause of error on this subject is, that the saints do not make the difference which scripture does between the government of God exercised over this earth and the necessary rejection of sin by God's nature -- His wrath from heaven.<a name=78:1></a> The evangelical world does not make the difference, and hence is liable to be misled, and unable to answer, though God may preserve souls by the instinctive sense of what is in scripture.<a name=78:2></a> Israel may be carried to Babylon, but Daniel finds it his sure path to heaven.<a name=78:3></a> All above twenty years old fall, save two, in the desert, but Moses and Aaron, and very likely many others, find their place in heaven too.<a name=78:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These dealings of God must be in connection with God's character, and immediately flow from it; but they are not the expression of it: they are His ways in and through men.<a name=78:5></a> Life and incorruptibility were brought to light by the gospel.<a name=78:6></a> Just judgment was expressed in these ways, but not the judgment of the secrets of men's hearts, but of men on the earth, for their conduct on the earth.<a name=78:7></a> This is so true that, though there are passages which lead the spiritual mind to see the loss and ruin of man ("He drove out the man:" that God was lost to man: that man had left God, the way back to the tree of life being barred), yet the express positive judgment as pronounced does not go beyond this world, even when it reaches death.<a name=78:8></a> Man was made out of the dust, and returns to the dust: but that is man, the object of our senses here; nor was more <i>openly</i> revealed.<a name=78:9></a> But the breath of God was not dust nor made out of the dust.<a name=78:10></a> Hence death, and destruction, and the like, in the Old Testament, though they may imply that displeasure which is the sign of what is connected with eternal misery, yet mean habitually, in the Old Testament, death and destruction by judgment in this world: a solemn and dreadful thing as God's displeasure, but which is not in itself eternal misery.<a name=78:11></a> The state of the soul afterwards may be learned from other truths, but what is expressed is present judgment without the smallest hint of what comes of the soul afterwards.<a name=78:12></a> It is judgment here.<a name=78:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The New Testament recognises this even to death, as judgment here too, but passes on to the revelation of what follows because life and incorruptibility are brought to light, and that the absolute incompatibility of God's nature and sin (not merely His governmental approbation of righteousness) is plainly revealed.<a name=78:14></a> But these, those who deny the immortality of the soul confound; and for the most part evangelicals too.<a name=78:15></a> The latter hold the truth in effect, but they accept the application of terms and passages to what is eternal, which puts a weapon in the hands of those who teach error, against which it is logically hard to defend themselves, though their faith may be right.<a name=78:16></a> Universalists are in the same error, but it does not so immediately affect the question on the surface of the matter; but it does as really, because the nature of sin and wrath is in question.<a name=78:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another source of error for the Universalist, allied to this, is the not perceiving that an entirely new life is given in Christ.<a name=78:18></a> The evil of the flesh of the old man is unaltered.<a name=78:19></a> They confound and forget, in looking only at the practical effect on our state, the real gift of life, and suppose that a process after death can form the soul for God.<a name=78:20></a> Where eternal life is, punishment can break the will, give seriousness, restrain under the sense of God's hand, and so work effects; but no punishment can ever give life, nor does grace alter the old man.<a name=78:21></a> I only speak of general principles, which lead to these errors here, because in universalism either Satan and the evil angels, to be more precise, can be saved without propitiation (and so can we then too), or their plea of God all in all is false, and mere human selfishness; and the evil spirits remain unsaved, for Christ did not take up the cause of angels.<a name=78:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I return to general principles.<a name=78:23></a> The Old Testament passages which furnish the vast majority of alleged proofs of the destruction of the wicked, speak of judgment and destruction in this world only.<a name=78:24></a> All beyond, save glimmers which traversed the gloom for faith, was dark and invisible.<a name=78:25></a> That system was the government of God, not salvation for God's presence and eternal life, though these were saved and quickened.<a name=78:26></a> Destructionism holds that eternal life is given in Christ alone, but confounds eternal life and the immortality of the soul, two entirely distinct things.<a name=78:27></a> As regards spiritual divine life, we have no life in us at all; we are dead.<a name=78:28></a> It is not merely that it is not immortal life; we have none.<a name=78:29></a> It denies that we are alive -- not that the soul is <i>immortal</i> but that we have life in us.<a name=78:30></a> They might as well, and more truly, use it to prove we are not alive at all -- for that is what is said -- than that the soul is not immortal.<a name=78:31></a> It does not apply to the question.<a name=78:32></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards destructionism, another false assumption, which formed the basis of thought in most minds affected by it, is that death is ceasing to exist.<a name=78:33></a> This is wholly groundless.<a name=78:34></a> Indeed it begs the whole question.<a name=78:35></a> It may or may not be, as far as man can say from what he sees; for beyond death he sees nothing.<a name=78:36></a> He may reason that the cessation of outward organisation does not and cannot affect that of which he has the consciousness, and have the strongest ground for rejecting the supposition when 'to be or not to be,' that is the question.<a name=78:37></a> He may speculate with Plato, or reason closely with Butler; but he knows nothing.<a name=78:38></a> As far as the intimations of the Old Testament go for faith, they furnish the thought which Pharisees had thus acquired of the subsistence of the soul after death.<a name=78:39></a> Thus Samuel is brought up: David says, "I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.<a name=78:40></a>" Enoch and Elijah gave yet brighter hopes in the darkness, though darkness still was there.<a name=78:41></a> So that the Lord could rebuke the Sadducees as not knowing the scriptures nor the power of God in rejecting the resurrection; and the resurrection involved the necessary truth expressed in Luke 20: 37, 38, that "all live unto him.<a name=78:42></a>" Nor did scripture know in this respect any difference between saints and sinners: not only was He the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob ("not the God of the dead, but of the living"), but the ground of thus was not their piety, but that for God all lived, even when for man they died.<a name=78:43></a> Sadducees are no new race; but they "err, not knowing the scriptures.<a name=78:44></a>" The Old and New Testaments alike forbid the thought that in man's case death is ceasing to exist: believers die, (Christ died just as much and as really as sinners.<a name=78:45></a> If death as such means ceasing to exist, then the saints and Christ ceased to exist.<a name=78:46></a> Nor can what has ceased to exist ever be raised again.<a name=78:47></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is another vital point in this question.<a name=78:48></a> The atonement is lost, and the responsibility in us to which it applies.<a name=78:49></a> If I have no more soul than a beast, though a more intelligent animal nature in degree, responsibility is gone.<a name=78:50></a> You cannot make a dog or an elephant responsible for sins.<a name=78:51></a> When I am converted, I repent, I judge my past sins; I feel I have failed in my responsibility; I learn that through infinite grace Christ has died for my sins.<a name=78:52></a> It is not merely that He becomes life -- new life to my soul.<a name=78:53></a> Thank God that is true; but He died and has made atonement for my guilt, my sins, when I had not yet that life.<a name=78:54></a> He died for our sins; and this that I might live.<a name=78:55></a> If eternal life were given to an animal, it could not repent of previous guilt; the Lord, with reverence be it spoken, could not make atonement for its previous sins: He has, blessed be His name, for mine.<a name=78:56></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Responsibility and atonement disappear with this doctrine, and in its value with universalism too; because, in the latter system, sin does not bring exclusion from God, but merely a measure of torment: the nature and character of sin is denied -- by some, indeed, expressly.<a name=78:57></a> And in the destructionist system, even the punishment of sin, temporary punishment after death has no ground.<a name=78:58></a> If I have only animal life, and can no more really sin than a dog or an elephant, what am I tortured for afterwards, and so destroyed?<a name=78:59></a>

		It is well to remark, that not only do the two systems of destructionism and universalism denounce each other as utterly unscriptural, but there are two parties among Destructionists.<a name=78:60></a> One holds death to be death, and the end of man as of a beast.<a name=78:61></a> They are consistent, at any rate; for if we cease to exist, we cease to exist.<a name=78:62></a> But then, if scripture be owned at all, we read "after this the judgment"; and so the other party bring them up again, though saying death is ceasing to exist, and then destroy them gradually in the fire: though, as I have said what for, it is hard to tell if they have only animal life; or who is raised, is hard to tell if they have ceased to exist.<a name=78:63></a> But there is the judgment after death; that is, they have not ceased to exist at all.<a name=78:64></a> The soul is a distinct thing; it survives the body: "All live unto him.<a name=78:65></a>"

		[C Wolston] BELOVED BROTHER, -- I have no objection to call the Holy Ghost Lord as a general title in glory and Godhead, just as Jehovah our God is called Lord -- regularly so, in the New Testament.<a name=83:21></a> "The Lord said unto my Lord," Jehovah to Adonai, and thus I am quite free, and have no quarrel with those who do, because He who is God must in a certain sense be Lord; and I think that 2 Corinthians 3: 18 does connect Lord closely with the Spirit; but verse 6 gives it a peculiar force, when after a long parenthesis verse 17 takes it up again.<a name=83:22></a> The revelation of the Lord is in the present power of the Spirit of God; and that is the way in which we have even the new covenant.<a name=83:23></a> But he identifies this with the present power of the Spirit in saying, "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, here is liberty.<a name=83:24></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not think 2 Thessalonians 3: 5 amounts to a very distinct testimony.<a name=83:25></a> It is the general expression for the ordering guiding power of grace over His people, and without any definite distinction.<a name=83:26></a> It is Christ that comes, if we define, with the term Lord to the mind.<a name=83:27></a> In the regular use of the word kuvrio" is used in two ways in the New Testament.<a name=83:28></a> The LXX.<a name=83:29></a> have always translated Jehovah by kuvrio" and so it is used as a name without any article in the New Testament.<a name=83:30></a> I have given a list in my French New Testament in the preface.<a name=83:31></a> Then we have Christ set as man in the place of Lordship.<a name=83:32></a> "God has made this same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.<a name=83:33></a>" Every tongue shall confess "that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.<a name=83:34></a>" "To us there is one God, the Father .<a name=83:35></a>.<a name=83:36></a>.<a name=83:37></a> and one Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=83:38></a>" This truth is very distinctly taught.<a name=83:39></a> It is not a question of nature, but of a place He has taken.<a name=83:40></a> And in this character the church or Christians constantly address Him: "all that in every place call upon the name of the Lord Jesus, theirs and ours.<a name=83:41></a>" It is a name of relationship -- "theirs.<a name=83:42></a>" "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.<a name=83:43></a>" "I besought the Lord thrice that it might depart from me.<a name=83:44></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Holy Ghost is the accomplisher of all grace in us.<a name=83:45></a> In that sense He carries out the lordship work in us.<a name=83:46></a> It is not a question of the Holy Ghost's nature or being or personality.<a name=83:47></a> They that lie to the Holy Ghost, lie to God.<a name=83:48></a> He distributes to whom He will; and as thus acting He is practically Lord.<a name=83:49></a> Still though He exercises the authority in and over us, yet He refers our hearts to Christ.<a name=83:50></a> There are diversities of <i>operations</i>, but one Spirit.<a name=83:51></a> There are diversities of ministrations, but one Lord.<a name=83:52></a> So as to unity -- one Spirit, one body, one hope of our calling: one Lord, one faith, one baptism.<a name=83:53></a> Thus in the practical sense the Holy Spirit acts as Lord.<a name=83:54></a> We are led by Him.<a name=83:55></a> The Holy Ghost said "Separate me.<a name=83:56></a>" But the title as appropriated is Christ's, or Jehovah, or the general divine authority and rule.<a name=83:57></a> The action by which Lordship is exercised in grace in us, is by the Spirit, as in 1 Corinthians 12 -- distributing: but the title Lord in administration is in Christ.<a name=83:58></a> If Christ directs my heart, the Holy Ghost would do it in me.<a name=83:59></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Acts 4 it is another matter: it is despovth" not kuvrio", I mean in verse 24; as "the Lord that bought them," "the only Lord God" -- despot literally -- bought them, being the comparison of a master buying a slave.<a name=83:60></a> In verse 29, it is general, but if defined refers to Jehovah.<a name=83:61></a> "Child" (verse 30), is servant, Christ as man (exalted) is looked at as not dou'los, bondsman, but the servant of God.<a name=83:62></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But though Christ be made Lord and Christ as man, yet through His oneness with the Father and His being the true God, it runs up into a divine title; just as in the case with Son.<a name=83:63></a> He is in the place of Son as man, or we could not be with Him.<a name=83:64></a> "That holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God;" but it cannot be separated from divine and eternal Sonship.<a name=83:65></a> As man He becomes and enters into -- is in so far as He is a man in -- the relationship with the Father as divine and eternal Son.<a name=83:66></a> In all the works of God we find this co-operation of the Persons.<a name=83:67></a> The Son wrought; yet He could say, "The Father that dwelleth in me, He doeth the works:" and, "If I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you.<a name=83:68></a>" I know not that I can add more to make it clear.<a name=83:69></a> Definitions here are not man's part: he receives, thanks and worships .<a name=83:70></a>.<a name=83:71></a>.<a name=83:72></a> .<a name=83:73></a>

		My kindest love to the brethren.<a name=83:74></a> I rejoice in their blessing and joy in Christ, as my own -- in some sense more.<a name=83:75></a> The love of Christ directs the eye on them He loves.<a name=83:76></a> All is going on very fast here, but towards what?<a name=83:77></a> But the blessed Lord is as sure for this as for every other state of His saints, and the truth and the word of truth increasingly precious, Christ more all -- at any rate, more separately and contrastedly .<a name=83:78></a>.<a name=83:79></a>.<a name=83:80></a> .<a name=83:81></a> Peace be with you.<a name=83:82></a>

		P.S.<a name=83:84></a> -- In reply to the fly leaf I had not sufficiently noticed I add: It is not any question of Person or dignity as to the Holy Ghost that hinders His being the object addressed in prayer, but the place He holds in the divine economy.<a name=83:85></a> He does govern as we are led by Him, but our communion is with (objectively) the Father and His Son Jesus Christ.<a name=83:86></a> It is eternal life to know the Father and Jesus Christ whom He has sent.<a name=83:87></a> Yet without the Spirit, and a divine Spirit, we could have no communion and no knowledge.<a name=83:88></a> The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost given to us: our bodies are His temples.<a name=83:89></a> But it is as in us He works, leading us objectively to the Father and the Son.<a name=83:90></a> But God dwells in us: by the Spirit we know the Son is in the Father, a divine Person thereby; we know we are in Him, and He in us.<a name=83:91></a> And in Romans 8 we find Christ and the Spirit in this respect identified.<a name=83:92></a> The Holy Ghost is a divine person and in the unity of the Godhead adored and worshipped.<a name=83:93></a> He is the immediate agent of all that God does -- immediate to the effects.<a name=83:94></a> But His place in the divine ways is not in the same way objective -- as divine and as personal, but not in God's ways so objective.<a name=83:95></a>

		Dearest G V Wigram, -- I write a line to say we are all here well, every way favoured in our voyage.<a name=87:1></a> But I have delayed my letter that I might give you some account of our conference.<a name=87:2></a> The evangelists had brought so many younger converts, that the beginning of the conference gave less communion than earlier ones, but met the need of the moment.<a name=87:3></a> Questions, though reading Ephesians, on how to preach the gospel, Christ dying for all, how to put bearing sins, and the import of the blood on the mercy-seat and the scape-goat, mixed with dying for our sins and our dying with Him, responsibility, and counsels, and such like, but all useful.<a name=87:4></a> After Sunday, when we broke bread, I suppose some four hundred, a very good time, many had to go away, and there was more study and following out the subject -- we had got to the armour -- and then a synopsis of Matthew, John, and Hebrews, for we stayed another week, and, indeed, a few of us are going to read 1 and 2 Timothy today.<a name=87:5></a> Many came from different parts of the States, and all our evangelists were there, some under tents.<a name=87:6></a> The happiest spirit reigned throughout.<a name=87:7></a> A few left for England before we had finished.<a name=87:8></a> On the whole, I think, through mercy, it has in some measure met the need of the case.<a name=87:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Some of the converts in the Ottawa valley are dispersed, but a very real work has been done.<a name=87:10></a> The evangelists had in some places shut the door against themselves somewhat, by preaching against the denominations and baptism, which alienated the minds of some, but I do not think the former made as much difference in result as might appear, because in the long run it was found out it did separate.<a name=87:11></a> But it made this difference, it gave a different tone to their testimony, and in -- , where they did not, the people were disposed in their favour, because the clergy attacked them and they attacked nobody.<a name=87:12></a> Both subjects came up at the end of the meeting, though I had abstained from it, but said what I thought when others brought it up.<a name=87:13></a> But there was no jar on any one's spirit; it was quietly inquired into.<a name=87:14></a> The Lord has been gracious to us, and I am thankful.<a name=87:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I now for a brief moment purpose running round one or two places: all is open.<a name=87:16></a> On souls just coming out, the speaking or praying (so to speak) against denominations does harm.<a name=87:17></a> I fear one interesting labourer was driven away by -- doing so at the beginning, but all is in the Lord's hands.<a name=87:18></a>

		[L Pilson] DEAR BROTHER, -- Save giving the room they, the assembly, have nothing to do with testimony, though it be altogether happier to do it in fellowship.<a name=90:1></a> I say it only when the question is raised.<a name=90:2></a> Gifts are in the church, and one teaches at Ephesus or Corinth or wherever he may be by God's will.<a name=90:3></a> I feel it a totally different thing to speak when the saints are assembled as such, and when I stand alone speaking in my gift to people.<a name=90:4></a> I say this because the question has been raised here in England too.<a name=90:5></a> In one place, I believe, at this moment they are starving through this false notion.<a name=90:6></a> Whether an assembly asks any one to do it is a matter as to principle which depends on them.<a name=90:7></a> If they deny the individual exercise of the gift by an individual as such, they are denying the authority and title of the Holy Ghost who distributes as He wills, and Christ's too, whom such are servants of in this gift.<a name=90:8></a> All this is a mischievous delusion of Satan.<a name=90:9></a> It is a denial of the true liberty and title of the Holy Ghost.<a name=90:10></a> If the assembly prefer open meetings and have only one day in a hired room, I have not a word to say; I should fall in with the general desire.<a name=90:11></a> But if they reject the individual exercise of gift it is utterly false and pernicious.<a name=90:12></a> There could not be if this were true, Christ could not call, an apostle; nor the apostle, if He did, act out of the assembly.<a name=90:13></a> The gross absurdity of it in the case of an evangelist is evident, and the exercise of all gifts is alike under the authority of Christ, and ordered in the word.<a name=90:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to an individual having the care of getting some one to do it, that is a matter of the desire and love to souls of the assembly, who may wish there should be evangelising or teaching.<a name=90:15></a> If the room is theirs, and they do not like it, of course no one has a title to do it.<a name=90:16></a> If they wish it, it is a matter of service according to their wish.<a name=90:17></a> Outside this love and care for sinners or saints on the part of the assembly, a person's coming, or seeking a person, is an individual matter.<a name=90:18></a> The assembly has no business to meddle save as in all things of common interest among the saints of God.<a name=90:19></a>

		[G Biava] [From the French.<a name=94:1></a>] DEAR BROTHER, -- You ask for a few words upon the apostasy.<a name=94:2></a> I do not hold to the word apostasy.<a name=94:3></a> It expresses the open renunciation of Christianity rather than the abandonment of its principles by those who have made a profession of it.<a name=94:4></a> But the thing, as to the reality of it, is of all-importance for heart and conscience.<a name=94:5></a> So long as the word was applied only to the votaries of Romanism, one would have had no difficulty about using it; but when it is understood that if this falling away of Christendom has come, the effect of it has been universal, one is shocked by the use of the word.<a name=94:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The <i>open</i> apostasy, then, has not yet come; but the giving up of the authority and efficacy of the word, and of faith in the presence of the Holy Ghost, the substituting the authority of the clergy for the immediate rights of the Lord over the conscience, the denial of justification by faith, and the putting the efficacy of the sacraments in the place of the work of the Holy Spirit -- in a word, the full development of "the mystery of iniquity" -- shews us an abandonment of the first condition of the church, and of the principles upon which it was founded, which is a moral apostasy.<a name=94:7></a> As John says, "You have heard that antichrist shall come: even now there are many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.<a name=94:8></a>" Thus the apostasy, in the sense of a public giving up of Christianity, has not come; but the spirit of the apostasy manifests itself, not only in the development of the mystery of iniquity, but in the giving up of Christianity and of the authority of the word, and of Christ Himself, which characterises half the population of Western Europe -- rationalism, as it is called, and the spirit of rebellion which accompanies it.<a name=94:9></a> The thoughts of man have taken the place of the word of God; they will no longer have its authority: the will of man will no longer have the authority of Christ.<a name=94:10></a> If the antichrist is not there, antichrists have been there long since; if the apostasy is not there, the spirit of apostasy has long since taken hold upon the mind of men.<a name=94:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I said it was a serious matter.<a name=94:12></a> If the assembly -- for the word "church" is very misleading, since we ask ourselves what the church is -- if the assembly of God has not kept its first estate, if it has said, "My Lord delayeth his coming," and has begun to beat the servants, and to eat and drink and be drunken -- and it has done this for a long time, for centuries -- it will be cut in sunder and will have its portion with the hypocrites.<a name=94:13></a> It is said that Christ built His assembly upon the rock, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.<a name=94:14></a> This I believe, thank God, with all my heart.<a name=94:15></a> But this has nothing to do with the question.<a name=94:16></a> That which Christ built, indeed, will not be overthrown by the enemy; surely not.<a name=94:17></a> It is a question of what man has built, in that case it is not so.<a name=94:18></a> "I," says Paul, "as a wise master-builder, have laid the foundation .<a name=94:19></a>.<a name=94:20></a>.<a name=94:21></a> but let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.<a name=94:22></a>" There it is the responsibility of man, which in some sort -- in a certain sense altogether -- enters into the question of the building.<a name=94:23></a> It is indeed the building of God, the apostle says, but it is built under the responsibility of man: a present thing upon the earth.<a name=94:24></a> It is not a question here of the salvation of individuals, but of the condition of the system in which those individuals are.<a name=94:25></a> When the end of Judaism under the first covenant came, pious souls -- believers -- were transferred to the church.<a name=94:26></a> God made an end of the dispensation for ever.<a name=94:27></a> At the close of the christian dispensation the faithful will be taken to heaven, and judgment will put an end to the system in which they were previously.<a name=94:28></a> Nothing is more simple.<a name=94:29></a> The old world perished; Noah and his family were saved.<a name=94:30></a> The judgment of a system does not touch God's faithfulness, if it does not prove it by making apparent that He keeps His own even when all around them sink under the weight of His judgment.<a name=94:31></a> But what can be more solemn than the judgment of that which God established on the earth, that which had been dear to Him?<a name=94:32></a> If Jesus could weep over Jerusalem, how deeply ought His people to feel the thought of the coming judgment of that which had a value far more precious than even Jerusalem.<a name=94:33></a> It is thus that Jeremiah, the vessel of the lamentations of the Spirit of God under the old economy, in words of rare and touching beauty, shews his deep grief in view of the ruin of that which belonged to God: "The Lord has violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were of a garden: he has destroyed his places of the assembly .<a name=94:34></a>.<a name=94:35></a>.<a name=94:36></a> .<a name=94:37></a> The Lord has cast off his altar, he has abhorred his sanctuary.<a name=94:38></a>" (Lamentations 2: 6, 7.<a name=94:39></a>) This is the spirit in which the faithful one ought to think of the ruin of that which names the name of Christ.<a name=94:40></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But you will say: Yes, certainly; when it was a question of Judaism, that is plain; but it could not happen to Christianity.<a name=94:41></a> In the first place, that is just what the unbelieving Jews in the days of Jeremiah said: "The law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet" -- a false confidence this, which brought destruction upon the people and upon the holy city.<a name=94:42></a> But there is more than this; it is precisely against this very false confidence that Paul (Romans 11) solemnly warns Christians from among the Gentiles, that is to say, as drawing a parallel between the Jews and Christendom.<a name=94:43></a> "Behold then the goodness and severity of God: upon them who have fallen, severity; upon thee, goodness, <i>if thou continue in.<a name=94:44></a> his goodness</i>, otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.<a name=94:45></a>" That is to say, the Christian system among the Gentiles is subject to the same judgment as the Jewish system.<a name=94:46></a> If the Gentiles, who stand only by faith, do not continue in the goodness of God, they will suffer a like fate with the Jews.<a name=94:47></a> Is Romanism the "continuing in the goodness of God"?<a name=94:48></a> Are "perilous times" the result of "continuing in the goodness of God;" or is the "form of godliness, denying the power of it" from which the Christian must "turn away" (2 Timothy 3)?<a name=94:49></a> If the apostle could say, "All seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ" -- is that "continuing in the goodness of God"?<a name=94:50></a> If the apostle foresaw that after his departure, evil would immediately intrude itself, the strong hand of the apostle being no longer there to keep the door shut against the adversary; if Jude was compelled to say that those who were the subjects of judgment had already crept into the church; if John had said they had left the Christians, had gone out from them -- a step beyond that of which Jude speaks -- that there were many antichrists, and that by this they might know that it was the last times; if Peter announces to us that "the time was come that judgment should begin at the house of God" -- does all this lead us to believe that the Gentiles have continued in the goodness of God, or that the Christian system established among the Gentiles would be terminated by judgment, the terrible judgment of God; that as to outward profession it is a question of drinking of the cup of His unmingled wrath, or of being spued out of His mouth as nauseous because of its lukewarmness?<a name=94:51></a> This is what is so solemn for our consciences.<a name=94:52></a> Shall we, as a system, come under God's judgment?<a name=94:53></a> The faithful will assuredly enjoy a far more excellent portion, a heavenly glory, but the christian system, as a system on the earth, will be cut off for ever.<a name=94:54></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With regard to the passages quoted from Mons.<a name=94:55></a> Bost, what he says is entirely false.<a name=94:56></a> The scriptures speak of the assembly as the habitation of God down here.<a name=94:57></a> The whole question lies here.<a name=94:58></a> In a house, the question is not of union but of dwelling.<a name=94:59></a> With regard to the body of Christ, it could not have dead members.<a name=94:60></a> We may deceive men, but in very truth he who is united to the Head is one Spirit.<a name=94:61></a> The body is formed by the baptism of the Holy Spirit.<a name=94:62></a> (1 Corinthians 12) Then, Christ builds a house which will not be complete till the last stone shall have been placed in it; it grows to be a holy temple in the Lord.<a name=94:63></a> But we have seen that down here the building being committed to men, it may be that the house is badly built, and will draw down the judgment of God upon what has been done.<a name=94:64></a> That the church has been placed as the pillar and ground of the truth, and that she is still responsible to keep that place, is quite another thing from saying that she has kept it.<a name=94:65></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the first Epistle to Timothy depicts for us the order of the house of God, and how man should behave himself in the house of God.<a name=94:66></a> Has he then behaved thus?<a name=94:67></a> -- this is the question.<a name=94:68></a> If he has done so, whence then the papacy?<a name=94:69></a> The second Epistle to Timothy directs the conduct of the faithful when confusion has come in.<a name=94:70></a> Already christian things were no longer in the condition in which they had been formerly.<a name=94:71></a> At the beginning, "the Lord added to the assembly daily such as should be saved.<a name=94:72></a>" They were manifested, and were added in the sight of the world to a well-known body.<a name=94:73></a> Now when the apostle writes his second Epistle to Timothy, this was already changed.<a name=94:74></a> All he can say is, "the Lord knows them that are his:" they might indeed be hidden from man, as the seven thousand were from Elijah.<a name=94:75></a> But along with this, there is a rule for the faithful one, "Let every one that nameth the name of the Lord depart from iniquity.<a name=94:76></a>" Then comes the thought of the great house.<a name=94:77></a> We must expect to find in a great house vessels to dishonour as well as vessels to honour, but again there is a rule for the faithful one.<a name=94:78></a> He must purify himself from the vessels to dishonour, and not only so, he must "follow righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those that call on the Lord out of a pure heart" In this state of disorder I cannot know, as at the beginning, all those who belong to God; but as to my own walk, I am to associate with those who have a pure heart.<a name=94:79></a> Further, in chapter iii.<a name=94:80></a>, the apostle teaches us that in the last days perilous times shall come, when, under the form of godliness, its power shall be denied.<a name=94:81></a> This is not avowed apostasy, for there is a form of godliness; but it is real moral apostasy -- the power of it is denied.<a name=94:82></a> M.<a name=94:83></a> Bost says, I ought to remain in it and be content with it; the apostle bids me "from such turn away" -- whom shall I obey?<a name=94:84></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When he tells me that "it is impossible to distinguish those who are truly faithful from those who make an outward profession," and the apostle says, Let him who names the name of the Lord withdraw from iniquity, and tells me that I must purify myself from the vessels to dishonour and follow after christian graces with those that call on the Lord out of a pure heart how can I listen to one who tells me that it is not possible to distinguish?<a name=94:85></a> If he tells me that there may be many souls, known by the Lord, whom I do not recognise; I reply, undoubtedly: the Lord knows those that are His.<a name=94:86></a> But I have directions for my conduct in this state of things which contradict yours.<a name=94:87></a> I am to recognise and associate myself with those that call on the Lord out of a pure heart; consequently to distinguish them.<a name=94:88></a> I am to purify myself from the vessels to dishonour; consequently to distinguish them.<a name=94:89></a> I am to turn away from those who have the form of godliness, but deny the power of it; I must then clearly recognise those who are such.<a name=94:90></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Further, it is a frightful principle to say that we cannot distinguish between the children of God and the people of the world -- besides it is not true -- a frightful principle, for it is said, "By this shall all know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another": now, if I cannot discern them, I cannot love them, and the testimony which God would have is lost.<a name=94:91></a> In the next place, it is not true practically, for we enjoy brotherly fellowship, and every faithful Christian makes a difference between a child of God and one who is not.<a name=94:92></a> There are some that we do not discern and that God knows: this is not denied.<a name=94:93></a> But in this respect the passages which I have quoted from 2 Timothy guide us.<a name=94:94></a> What would become of family affection if a father were to say to his children, You cannot tell who are your brothers and who are not; you must associate with everybody, without any distinction whatever?<a name=94:95></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not look into dictionaries, as they tell us to do, but into the hearts and consciences of those who love the Lord, taking the word of God that I may see what was the state of the church at the beginning, and what it is now; and what that word says to inform us as to what the church would become in the last times.<a name=94:96></a> The word is as clear as can be as to the decline of the church, and the character of the last times, and as to the setting aside of the christian system.<a name=94:97></a> The word is clear enough as to the unity which should subsist as a testimony borne to the world, that it might believe.<a name=94:98></a> (John 17) If a letter were addressed by the apostle to the church of God which is at Turin, who would obtain the letter at the Post Office except those of the Roman system?<a name=94:99></a> The church, as it was at the beginning, no longer exists.<a name=94:100></a> Call it what you will provided that the heart feels that you have at heart the glory of the Lord trodden under foot by men.<a name=94:101></a> If the present state of the church is not the great beast which is spoken of the indifference of conscience which can say so, and cavil a to the use of the word, is the most obvious proof of that lukewarmness which in the end causes Christ to spue the church out of His mouth.<a name=94:102></a>

		The grand principle of Romanism, and of other systems which are more or less like it, and which makes them essentially false, is that they attribute to Christendom -- the assembly organised by means of ordinances -- the stability and the unfailing privileges which belong only to that which Christ has built, to that which is the work of the Holy Spirit.<a name=94:115></a> All kinds of false doctrines are the result of this error; one is born of God, a member of the body of Christ -- then one perishes: one is pardoned -- and lost.<a name=94:116></a> That is what the article in the Vedetta Cristiana comes to, what the passage quoted by M.<a name=94:117></a> Bost involves.<a name=94:118></a> He forgets one of the two principal characteristics of the church according to the word, precisely the one where the responsibility of man comes in; that is, of being the habitation of God on the earth.<a name=94:119></a> He shews us the title that Ephesians 1 gives us, and overlooks that of Ephesians ii.<a name=94:120></a>; then he shews us the condition in which the church now is, not surely composed of true members of Christ, without accounting for it, and without giving any information about the matter that might enable us to know whether it is good or bad -- whence it comes, where it will end, or how the word judges of this state of things.<a name=94:121></a> The expressions which he uses are equivalent to those of the unbelieving Jews in Jeremiah's time -- "We are delivered to do all these abominations.<a name=94:122></a>" No one can say that the state of the church of Christendom is at all in any respect, such as we find it in the word.<a name=94:123></a> At the beginning there was no Romanism, no National Church, no Dissenters.<a name=94:124></a> There was the church of God, and nothing else; which, it will be said, became very quickly corrupted.<a name=94:125></a> Be it so.<a name=94:126></a> Has it taken place?<a name=94:127></a> But there was a church to corrupt, an assembly into which some men had slipped.<a name=94:128></a> Was this corruption a good thing, or does it not bring judgment?<a name=94:129></a> Has it not made frightful progress since?<a name=94:130></a> Has the church of God been re-established on earth?<a name=94:131></a> Ought I to mourn over it?<a name=94:132></a> Should I not search in the world to see what its end will be, and pay attention to this?<a name=94:133></a> We have quoted this word, let each one judge before God what it says.<a name=94:134></a> If we are in grievous times, has not the word given us principles by which we may trace the way in which we ought to walk?<a name=94:135></a> If any one has the conviction that we are in those sad times of which he reads in 2 Timothy 2, 3, and will be before God, who has given us those principles, in full confidence in Christ, the result as to his conviction will not be doubtful.<a name=94:136></a> May he know how to walk with God!<a name=94:137></a>

		As regards crovnwn aijwnivwn (Titus 1: 2), it is not to be doubted that associated with other words aijwnivo" has the sense sometimes of what is not properly eternal; it is the whole period designated by the subject: but as a word it means eternal.<a name=101:9></a> I might reply to a child who asked did I lend or give him something for ever, that it was for ever, though the thing was perishable; this does not change the meaning of 'for ever'; it is an unrecalled gift.<a name=101:10></a> I apprehend that pro; crovnwn aijwnivwn refers to that eternal purpose which was in the secret of God's mind, or to which He was engaged, unknown to the creature, before any revealed age, including the eternity in which we are in relationship with Him, was brought out into existence by God to whom there is no time.<a name=101:11></a> This is not foreign to, that is, does not exclude, embraces, your 'eternity commencing with creation'; but gives another idea to the expression.<a name=101:12></a> The "in due times manifested his word by preaching" precludes, I apprehend, any application to a promise merely, before the execution in the age to come.<a name=101:13></a> Many promises have been given in time, to encourage God's people in their course; but this was a counsel and promise before any of the ages in which His government is displayed on earth.<a name=101:14></a> It was a promise, and then a word manifested above and without the government of God, though that government might be applied to the details of its accomplishment, as has been the case.<a name=101:15></a> Hence, I judge, he speaks of its being specially committed to him; whereas the gospel as revealing Christ in connection with the promises made to the fathers was rather committed to Peter.<a name=101:16></a>

		[From the Italian.<a name=104:1></a>] G Biava, You ask why I 'believe that the seven churches give us the history of the whole church.<a name=104:2></a>' I will not say I believe; I believe what God has said; my faith is in the word of God itself; what it says I believe.<a name=104:3></a> But we can have our understandings enlightened by the Holy Spirit in order to understand what has been written in this word, and set it before our brethren as a matter of knowledge, not of faith.<a name=104:4></a> I think, then, as many other Christians do, and, as far as I am concerned, I have no doubt that this series of churches applies as history to the moral successive state of the whole church; the first four to the history of the church from its first decline to its present condition in popery; and the last three, from Sardis to Laodicea, are the history of Protestantism.<a name=104:5></a> If you examine the structure of Revelation, you find it is divided into three parts.<a name=104:6></a> Read chapter 1: 19: "Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter," literally, "after these.<a name=104:7></a>" Now "the things after these" (or "hereafter") begin in chapter 4.<a name=104:8></a> "The things which thou hast seen" precede evidently "the things which are" since the prophet has seen them; so "the things which are" are in chapters 2 and 3.<a name=104:9></a> In chapter 4 the throne of judgment is placed in heaven, not the throne of grace to which we draw near with boldness; from this throne proceeded lightnings, etc.<a name=104:10></a>, the signs of judgment.<a name=104:11></a> Now the judgments which proceed from this throne fall on the earth.<a name=104:12></a> The church is not seen still in the world, but in heaven, seated upon thrones around the throne of God.<a name=104:13></a> It comes with Christ and all the saints in chapter 19.<a name=104:14></a> These things are not the things which are, but those that come after these.<a name=104:15></a> "The things which are" refer therefore to the church looked on as placed under the responsibility of man and judged by the Lord; and the Lord is seen, not as head of His body, not as a Priest to intercede for us, and to help our infirmities, but as a Judge: He is not serving, but He walks in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks to see what is the true condition of each, and to pronounce His sentence.<a name=104:16></a> however, the series is presented as a whole.<a name=104:17></a> It begins with the first decline of the church, and goes on to the Lord's coming, and to the judgment of the church; whether it is judged, and the kingdom and the morning star are substituted for it, or spued out of the Lord's mouth.<a name=104:18></a> That this series is looked on as a whole is confirmed by the force of the number seven in the word.<a name=104:19></a> It is a whole during the time of the apostle and the things that take place when God intervenes to judge the world, begin in chapter 6 after the throne is set in chapter 4, and the Lamb has taken the book in chapter 5.<a name=104:20></a> It is not, however, a whole at the same time, because the state of each church is different.<a name=104:21></a> Still, if we examine the church of Philadelphia, we find that a time of tribulation is spoken of which shall come upon all the world, and the Lord adds, "Behold, I come quickly": this cannot apply to the church of Philadelphia alone.<a name=104:22></a> I have already drawn attention to the church of Thyatira, where those who are faithful are to maintain their fidelity until the Lord comes.<a name=104:23></a> If we believe -- and for myself, I do not doubt it -- that chapters 6 relate the history of the judgments of God and of the Lamb after the throne of judgment has been set in chapters 4 and 5, then it is certain the seven churches, "the things which are," give the history of the church from the beginning till the end, until the Lord comes to take it away, and gather it round Himself, in order that the saints should come with the Lord to judge the world, and reign over it.<a name=104:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now if we believe this, there are some points which may guide our intelligence, and confirm the justness of this way of thinking.<a name=104:25></a> The series begins with the decline of the church.<a name=104:26></a> It is necessary to observe, that these pictures of the church are not the history of the operations of God.<a name=104:27></a> God does not judge His own work, but when it has had its share in bringing about the result, then God judges this result; and that is what we find here.<a name=104:28></a> The Lord is not a servant in grace; He is not the Head of His body, and the source of grace and strength for His own as normally; but He wears a garment down to His feet, and He walks in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks to examine their condition.<a name=104:29></a> But man is not faithful, and the Lord finds that the church has left its first love.<a name=104:30></a> Through the faithfulness of God, persecutions follow; then corruption, and false and corrupt teaching.<a name=104:31></a> Then we find, not one teacher who teaches error and deceives the disciples, but that the woman Jezebel not only seduces, but is the mother of the corrupt; in the external church the children of corruption are born.<a name=104:32></a> Not only this, we find this solemn word, "And I gave her space to repent of her fornication, but she repented not.<a name=104:33></a>" Then comes His judgment: there is still time for those who commit adultery with her, but for her children, nothing save judgment.<a name=104:34></a> The faithful are exhorted to maintain their fidelity until the coming of the Lord.<a name=104:35></a> Then the kingdom and the morning star are substituted for the external church.<a name=104:36></a> Thus the history of the church in its responsibility is related from the first decline until its end, brought about by the coming of the Lord, who judges corrupt Jezebel, and her children, and establishes the kingdom and the heavenly glory in their stead.<a name=104:37></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in this case, what are the last three churches?<a name=104:38></a> I do not doubt that they represent Protestantism.<a name=104:39></a> The church of Sardis is not guilty of the horrible corruption of Jezebel, but she has a name to live, and yet she is dead; she is to be treated like the world -- solemn judgment.<a name=104:40></a> Compare 1 Thessalonians 5: 4; Revelation 3: 3.<a name=104:41></a> Philadelphia walks with little strength, but waits for the Lord's coming, and keeps the word of His patience; and she shall be kept from the day of temptation which shall come upon all the world.<a name=104:42></a> Then Laodicea is to be spued out of the mouth of the Lord.<a name=104:43></a> Thus we have the history of the external church upon the earth, and the sad result in the hands of men of the grace of God, but to be so much the more a witness of the patience and of the faithfulness of God towards His own.<a name=104:44></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I send only a few general principles.<a name=104:45></a> The understanding of the truth on this point depends on the explanation of all the ways of God towards the church and towards the world.<a name=104:46></a>

The whole truth of the gospel depends upon the distinction which is pointed out in these words.<a name=107:14></a> [John 1: 17.<a name=107:15></a>] The law requires from man what man ought to be, in order to be righteous before God.<a name=107:16></a> The Lord Jesus Christ is and has done all that was needed to save a sinner.<a name=107:17></a> The law was not given, it did not come by Him.<a name=107:18></a> He owned all its authority; He fulfilled it morally in His life; as to its typical meaning, for example the sacrifices, the priestly office, and in many other points, it has been fulfilled in what He has done, or in what He is now doing, or even in what He will do in time to come.<a name=107:19></a> But the grace that saves and quickens, and the truth that gives light and makes all things seen as they are, came by Jesus Christ.<a name=107:20></a> The law can neither save nor quicken; it cannot take away sins; it can impute them and it brings a curse, but Christ has been made a curse for us, and grace flows freely according to the righteousness of God: we share in this righteousness; we are made the righteousness of God in Him.<a name=107:21></a> "Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.<a name=107:22></a>" We are "set free from the law, being dead to that in which we were held.<a name=107:23></a>" The authority of the law is not weakened, but we have died in the death of Christ, and the law has dominion over a man as long as he is alive.<a name=107:24></a> But we are dead and the law cannot apply to a dead man: we have been crucified with Christ.<a name=107:25></a> The death of Christ confirms the law as nothing else does since it announces its curse, but we believers are set free from the law because we have died with Christ; we are dead to sin as to the law and alive to God through Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=107:26></a> Grace and truth have in no way come by the law, but by Jesus Christ the Son of God.<a name=107:27></a> The law was not annulled by His coming, but fulfilled: we are not under law but under grace.<a name=107:28></a> We do not sin because we have died with Christ; we have died to sin, to the law, by the body of Christ, This is true liberty, being made free from sin that we may live unto God in the new life which we have received from Christ, strengthened by the power of the Holy Ghost, Christ being the only object of our life.<a name=107:29></a>

		4. The absolutely perfect and living rule is the life of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=107:30></a> In Him all written rules are united in one solitary living example; but the written rule which ought to govern our whole life is the New Testament.<a name=107:31></a> The Old Testament gives the most precious light, and illuminates the path of Christians by the light of divine faith working in hearts; still, before the rending of the veil, it could not be said, "The true light now shineth," save in the life of Jesus Christ: He was the light of the world.<a name=107:32></a> For this reason when the Holy Ghost gives as examples of walking in the path of faith, the faithful of the Old Testament, He adds, "Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of faith.<a name=107:33></a>" The faithful have, each for himself, gone over a little bit of the path of faith: Jesus is the beginner and completer of this path.<a name=107:34></a> But whatever be the light that shines in the Old Testament, it is a precious light, and it can, <i>through the faith</i> which is in Christ Jesus, make us wise unto salvation.<a name=107:35></a> The precepts of the New Testament furnish a clear, perfect rule adapted to the Christian such as the Old could not do.<a name=107:36></a> Christ having suffered with a patience that was perfect, we have learned to walk in the same spirit; "If doing good and suffering, ye shall bear it, this is acceptable with God, for to this have ye been called.<a name=107:37></a>" "Let the same mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus.<a name=107:38></a>" He humbled Himself.<a name=107:39></a> We are called to walk worthy of the Lord so as to please Him in everything.<a name=107:40></a> We must know the Lord in order to walk thus -- "worthy of God who hath called you to his kingdom and glory.<a name=107:41></a>" This absolutely clear and perfect light is found in the New Testament alone; but the Old, if we have learned to distinguish between the dispensation under which the saints lived in those times, furnishes very fine examples of faith, of obedience, of subjection to the will of God, of constancy in His paths.<a name=107:42></a> Happy is he who keeps by His side to learn how one ought to walk, and who understands the riches that are in Christ, the beauty of His ways, to enjoy communion with Him pleasing Him every day more and more.<a name=107:43></a>

		Dear A T Schofield, -- There is no difference between [breaking bread as] a Christian and fellowship, though some may not be always there; because the only fellowship or membership is of the body of Christ, and if a person breaks bread and is thus recognised as a member of the body of Christ, he is subject to all the discipline of the house.<a name=109:1></a> I may not enforce constant attendance with us only, because he may come with the desire to shew unity of spirit, and yet think that <i>his</i> ways are more orderly conscientiously.<a name=109:2></a> If his heart be pure (2 Timothy 2), I have no reason to exclude him; but if anything in his path require he should be excluded, he is liable to it like any one else.<a name=109:3></a> But I know no fellowship other than of membership of the body of Christ.<a name=109:4></a> Being met, the question is has he done anything which involves disciplinary exclusion.<a name=109:5></a>

		Only I believe brethren alone walk in consistency with the fellowship of saints in the unity of the body; but I know no particular corporation as that body -- not even brethren -- nay, these least of all.<a name=109:6></a> This would deny themselves.<a name=109:7></a> Though they have this, that they meet on the principles of that unity, but for that reason, must own all its members, on the one hand, and maintain its discipline on the other.<a name=109:8></a>

		[From the French.<a name=110:1></a>] -- - It is clear to me that a Christian, free to do as he will, could never be a soldier, unless he were at the very bottom of the scale, and ignorant of the christian position.<a name=110:2></a> It is another thing when one is forced to it.<a name=110:3></a> In such a case the question is this: is the conscience so strongly implicated on the negative side of the question, that one could not be a soldier without violating that which is the rule for conscience -- the word of God In that case we bear the consequences; we must be faithful.<a name=110:4></a>

		What pains me is the manner in which the idea of one's country has taken possession of the hearts of some brethren.<a name=110:5></a> I quite understand that the sentiment of patriotism may be strong in the heart of a man.<a name=110:6></a> I do not think that the heart is capable of <i>affection</i> towards the whole world.<a name=110:7></a> At bottom, human affection must have a centre, which is 'I.<a name=110:8></a>' I can say, 'My country,' and it is not that of a stranger.<a name=110:9></a> I say, 'My children,' 'My friend,' and it is not a purely selfish 'I.<a name=110:10></a>' One would sacrifice one's life -- everything (not oneself, or one's honour) for one's country, one's friend.<a name=110:11></a> I cannot say, 'My world'; there is no appropriation.<a name=110:12></a> We appropriate something to ourselves that it may not be ourselves.<a name=110:13></a> But God delivers us from the 'I'; He makes of God, and of God in Christ, the centre of all; and the Christian, if consistent, declares plainly that he seeks a country -- a better, that is to say, a heavenly country.<a name=110:14></a> His affections, his ties, his citizenship, are above.<a name=110:15></a> He withdraws into the shade in this world, as outside the vortex which surges there, to engulph and carry everything away.<a name=110:16></a> The Lord is a sanctuary.<a name=110:17></a>

		That a Christian should hesitate whether he ought to obey or not, I understand: I respect his conscience; but that he should allow himself to be carried away by what is called patriotism -- that is what is not of heaven.<a name=110:18></a> "My kingdom," said Jesus, "is not of this world; if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight.<a name=110:19></a>" It is the spirit of the world under an honourable and attractive form, but wars come from "lusts that war in your members.<a name=110:20></a>"

		[From the French] BELOVED BROTHER, -- I do not believe that restoration means the recovery of peace, unless it be peace in the consciousness of the favour of God, which is enjoyed anew in the soul -- the re-establishment of liberty of heart with God.<a name=111:1></a> One meets with cases where a Christian has fallen, yet in nowise doubts his salvation, or the efficacy of the blood of Christ; but the heart has got to a distance from God, has not the sense of what sin is, such as the presence of God always gives.<a name=111:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now to be truly restored, the Christian must recognise the point of departure where his soul gave up communion with God, and sought its own will.<a name=111:3></a> It was thus with Peter.<a name=111:4></a> The Lord does not reproach him with his fault, but says to him, "Lovest thou me more than these?<a name=111:5></a>" That was the point where his soul had turned aside from the right way, where self had shewn itself, confidence in himself.<a name=111:6></a> The Lord probes Peter's heart, and makes known to him the undercurrent of pride and false confidence which was found there.<a name=111:7></a> Until that moment Peter was not restored, although on the way to be so.<a name=111:8></a> When a brother in fellowship has fallen, and has sincerely acknowledged his fault as an evil, even when he may have been reinstated, he is always in danger of falling again if he has not judged the root of it.<a name=111:9></a> It is there that he got to a distance from God.<a name=111:10></a> Communion with God is not thoroughly re-established, self and its will are not thoroughly broken, as long as the Christian has not found the point where his heart began to lose its spiritual sensibility; for the presence of God makes us feel that.<a name=111:11></a> I am not speaking of a matter of memory, but of the state of the soul .<a name=111:12></a>.<a name=111:13></a>.<a name=111:14></a> .<a name=111:15></a> One meets with cases (where probably true deliverance had never been realised), like that of dear -- , where despair takes possession of one in failure.<a name=111:16></a> Then it is a question of finding peace through the blood of Jesus, or at least of power to raise the shield of faith, of confidence in God.<a name=111:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A soul is restored when it enjoys the favour of God, not simply as certainty of salvation, but when the Spirit, instead of accusing, causes it to rejoice in the goodness of God.<a name=111:18></a> Restoration is not complete until there is enjoyment of communion with our brethren.<a name=111:19></a> I remember having seen horror at having sinned against grace, and at the dishonour done to the name of Christ, as the first effect of the renewed power of the word in the heart: then came the sense that grace has triumphed over all -- blessed be God!<a name=111:20></a>

		Dearest R Evans, -- I return -- 's letter.<a name=113:1></a> As to his statements, I know of no brother who holds that Christ had a life distinct from His communion with God, a life to which sin and death belonged: such a Christ would not be the true Christ at all.<a name=113:2></a> It is utterly false doctrine, and I know no one who holds it; and, unless abandoned, should think such a person ought to be excluded from communion.<a name=113:3></a> That sin attached to the life He had when on the cross, in the sense that He bore our sins and was made sin for us, is a fundamental doctrine of scripture, but it was He who knew no sin who was made sin, taking it on Himself, or rather having it laid on Him by God, and, as so, bearing it, He laid down His life, or died - this is also is fundamental.<a name=113:4></a> Further, that He took life again in a.<a name=113:5></a> different condition afterwards is stated in scripture -- "Being raised from the dead dieth no more, death hath no more dominion over him.<a name=113:6></a>" It was not different as to sinlessness, sinless He always was; but He was "made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death:" now, as Man, He is exalted above all principality and power, and cannot die.<a name=113:7></a> Before, He could, for He did, and took manhood to do it -- for the suffering of death took flesh and blood, that through death He might destroy him that had the power of death -- but He was always in relationship with His Father, and in perfect communion, save as drinking the cup on the cross, when He said, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me" -- yet never more perfect than then.<a name=113:8></a> If brethren held what he states, I should not blame him for leaving them .<a name=113:9></a>.<a name=113:10></a>.<a name=113:11></a> .<a name=113:12></a>

		Christ making His own generation is dark enough: He was "made ( genovmeno" ) of a woman," but miraculously that there might be no sin; but "of the seed of David according to the flesh," and carefully traced up to Adam in Luke.<a name=113:13></a> But when he talks of a generation of light since Seth, and in consideration of their being flesh and blood, Christ took it, he is again away from scripture; for the saved were "sometimes darkness," and then "light in the Lord": there is no generation of light but by grace.<a name=113:14></a> Here, though obscurely stated, I am afraid there is something radically unsound.<a name=113:15></a> In Colossians "the beginning" is connected with resurrection.<a name=113:16></a> That Christ had eternally both life and quickening power I do not doubt, and so when here, and that it was a holy thing that was born of the virgin Mary.<a name=113:17></a> That Christ had no connection with the sin of human nature, but was as really a man come in flesh as we are, is fundamental as to the truth.<a name=113:18></a> That -- has allowed his mind to act on scripture, and got away from divine teaching, is quite plain, and is in danger of denying the real humanity of the Lord; and as to this 'generation of light' and the like, his mind is dangerously at work, instead of being subject to God.<a name=113:19></a> But gracious communicating might restore him: he studies scripture, but trusts his own mind, and that will not do in the things of God.<a name=113:20></a>

		Dear Lucius Pilson, -- Though the natural construction is "are" (Revelation 20.<a name=118:1></a> 10), as you might insert "were," or "had been cast," inasmuch as there is no verb, it would not be wise to insist on "are" by itself.<a name=118:2></a> It is not "were.<a name=118:3></a>" If it is not "are" which I think it is, it is "were cast," carrying on the sense of ejblhvqh, but in either case basanisqhvsontai takes them all in.<a name=118:4></a>

		You are quite right as to "destruction," but some of the annihilationists here do not admit the Lord's coming.<a name=118:5></a> If it be admitted, then 2 Thessalonians 1: 9 shews clearly that their use of it is false.<a name=118:6></a> But you have only to substitute "annihilated" for the word translated "destroyed," and the absurdity is evident.<a name=118:7></a> He came "to seek and to save those who were annihilated!<a name=118:8></a>" "O Israel, thou hast annihilated thyself, but I am thy help!<a name=118:9></a>" and the like.<a name=118:10></a> Secondly, I believe death and hades (Revelation 20: 13) are personified.<a name=118:11></a> and that there is no more death or state of separate spirits -- that is, in their separate subsisting condition of power.<a name=118:12></a> The power of death which Satan has is finally put an end to.<a name=118:13></a> But I have very little doubt that the contents of death and hell are included in them, in contrast with those in the book of life.<a name=118:14></a> But do not entangle yourself in volunteering explanations of difficult passages, when plain answers to error are there.<a name=118:15></a> The "second death" is explained in the word itself.<a name=118:16></a> It is the lake of fire: and in that torment is said to subsist, (not chapter 20: 14) 21: 8.<a name=118:17></a> It is -- not causes -- the second death; they have their part in it.<a name=118:18></a> If you ask me what I think of the second death, I believe it is the judicial separation of man from God, in the lake of fire, as death was the separation of soul and body.<a name=118:19></a> I had to meet one of these men lately, but I find that they quail before the word if it is known.<a name=118:20></a> It involves the immortality of the soul, and there can be no guilt or atonement for a mere beast's soul.<a name=118:21></a>

		The non-subsequent existence of death and hades is merely a consequence drawn from general truth.<a name=118:22></a> They merge in the lake of fire.<a name=118:23></a> In the language they are personified and nothing is said of their destruction or non-existence there.<a name=118:24></a> I add this because they may use it as a plea that it means ceasing to exist.<a name=118:25></a> It does not.<a name=118:26></a> We find those who are looked at as living beings tormented there.<a name=118:27></a> It is therefore not ceasing to exist.<a name=118:28></a> When I interpret the passage, their power is absorbed in the lake of fire, as the kingdom in eternal glory in which it ceases to exist; and from that and other sources I see that they cease to exist, but not by the lake of fire as they pretend the wicked do.<a name=118:29></a> They could not say death and hades were tormented.<a name=118:30></a> I have no doubt at all of the meaning.<a name=118:31></a> But it is no proof at all that anything ceases to exist by the lake of fire as a punishment.<a name=118:32></a> Such a sense would not be applied to death and hell: nor in any case does torment mean ceasing to exist, for it ceases when the person tormented ceases to exist; that is, the second death is not ceasing to exist, for that is the lake of fire.<a name=118:33></a>

		Dear F G Patterson, -- My feeling is to let it work itself out.<a name=119:1></a> Some who spoke to me were really true in heart.<a name=119:2></a> And any others I have known will not, as to discipline, recognise the unity of the body.<a name=119:3></a> I should hold fast to this .<a name=119:4></a>.<a name=119:5></a>.<a name=119:6></a> .<a name=119:7></a> If unity as to discipline be not owned, we are independent churches.<a name=119:8></a> When H.<a name=119:9></a> B.<a name=119:10></a> asked me what was to be done, I said, Bethesda judged or honestly separated from, that is, no one should go there and the meeting openly disowned unless they repented -- guarantee for sound doctrine -- and the unity of the body owned.<a name=119:11></a> But their anxiety is for outward adhesion, and such that the worldly camp can be more or less owned.<a name=119:12></a> I have no desire for that -- all Christians individually surely owned who walk uprightly.<a name=119:13></a> A vast amount of the evangelisation has been by and in connection with brethren, and some of the most efficient are very strong upon the point.<a name=119:14></a>
	</div>

		There are those who act in this movement who are, I think, deliberately unfaithful -- I mean by that, who deliberately take an unfaithful path for convenience, some who spoke to me in [Dublin] preferred an evil course.<a name=119:15></a> I think in the leaders there is the pretension of a successful revival movement; they will find their level.<a name=119:16></a> This has no attraction for me, but there are those who are simple and perplexed by the wickedness of the Bethesdaites.<a name=119:17></a>

		[From the French] DEAR BROTHER, -- Very little is known of the history of what is called the church -- what is the church as to its responsibility -- and of the conduct of the clergy and indeed of everybody.<a name=120:1></a> It is happy to have only the word to follow, and to know that it is the word of God.<a name=120:2></a> What an immense mercy to have His word, the revelation of His grace towards us, of Jesus the perfect One, of the counsels of God, and what God has ordained for our glory.<a name=120:3></a> It is in His kindness towards us that, in the ages to come, He will shew forth the immense riches of His grace.<a name=120:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		From the beginning, trusting the enemy rather than God, man was alienated from God, and the two questions: Where art thou?<a name=120:5></a> What hast thou done?<a name=120:6></a> shewed where man was as the consequence of it.<a name=120:7></a> Responsibility put fully to the test up to the rejection of Christ; then, God glorified in righteousness, His love, and the counsels of His grace from before the foundation of the world have been manifested -- that puts the gospel in a very special place, and then shews the connection of responsibility and sovereign grace with great distinctness.<a name=120:8></a> Moreover, there is no longer any veil over the glory of God.<a name=120:9></a> Thence, His wrath is revealed from heaven; but also, the glory of God is revealed in the face of Jesus Christ, witness that all the sins of those who behold it exist no longer before God; then, all that God is morally is fully revealed and established.<a name=120:10></a> We know Him according to that glory, and our relationship with God, our standing before God, are founded upon it.<a name=120:11></a> We are transformed from glory to glory according to that image, for we can look upon it: it is the proof of our redemption, and the proof that our sins no longer subsist before God.<a name=120:12></a> We are also renewed in knowledge after the image of Him who created us; we are created according to God in righteousness and true holiness; for, according to that glory, He hath shined in our hearts in order to shew out this glory of Christ in the world.<a name=120:13></a> We are like a lantern: the light is within, but it is to shine without; but dull glass (the flesh if it interferes) will prevent the light from shining as it should.<a name=120:14></a> Thus, that which is given us becomes inward exercise: the treasure is in an earthen vessel, and it is necessary that this latter be only a vessel; that we should be dead, in order that the life of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh.<a name=120:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not only a communication of what is in Christ, as knowledge; but if it is real, we drink of that which makes the river.<a name=120:16></a> It is a communication that exercises the soul, makes it grow, and judges the flesh in everything, in order that we may not mar the testimony which is thus committed to us.<a name=120:17></a> In Christ Himself, the life was the light of men, and the light that we receive must become life in us, the formation of Christ in us, and the flesh must be subjected to death.<a name=120:18></a> "Death worketh in us," says Paul, "but life in you.<a name=120:19></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is the history of ministry, of true ministry.<a name=120:20></a> What we communicate is our own; it enlightens us, but it works in us morally; the glory of Christ is realised in us, and all that does not suit Him is judged: now flesh never suits Him.<a name=120:21></a> The death of Christ put an end to all that was Paul; thus the life of Christ acted from him in others, and nothing but that.<a name=120:22></a> That is saying a great deal.<a name=120:23></a> Thus, in this respect there may be progress.<a name=120:24></a> For as to my position before God, I reckon that I am dead; for in order to live, death works in me.<a name=120:25></a> There is the vessel, but it must be only a vessel, and the life of Christ acting in it and by it.<a name=120:26></a> If the vessel acts, it spoils all.<a name=120:27></a> In reality, we live; but we must always bear about death, in order that the glory of Christ, the image of God, may shine for others.<a name=120:28></a> But all the glory of God is revealed; there is no longer any veil over it on God's side; if it be veiled, the veil is on the heart of man through unbelief -- truth of all-importance!<a name=120:29></a> Under the law, man could not go in; God did not come out.<a name=120:30></a> Now He has come out, but humbling Himself, to bring grace.<a name=120:31></a> Then, the work of redemption accomplished, He has gone in, and there is no veil over the glory.<a name=120:32></a>

		[From the French.<a name=122:1></a>] DEAR SISTER, -- I have got the two books about which you spoke to me.<a name=122:2></a> They contain a mixture of old religious notions and new light obtained second-hand.<a name=122:3></a> I have no doubt at all as to Mrs.<a name=122:4></a> S.<a name=122:5></a>'s uprightness, nor of her desire to serve the Lord, and very likely her book may be useful to some souls.<a name=122:6></a> But it does not seem to me that the tone of the book is quite according to the Lord.<a name=122:7></a> It savours rather of the school to which she belongs: she hardly rises above the condition of her soul, and the circumstances in which she is.<a name=122:8></a> A.<a name=122:9></a> S.<a name=122:10></a>, not the Lord Jesus, is the principal figure of the picture.<a name=122:11></a> Experience holds the place which redemption and the Redeemer ought to hold.<a name=122:12></a> Jesus becomes the servant of the soul, in place of the soul being at peace, serving the Lord.<a name=122:13></a> And so it ever is; I have never seen a soul living in its experiences and occupied with itself, with whom the "I" had not a place, without the person's being aware of it, and even without his having a suspicion that it was so.<a name=122:14></a> The Lord Jesus, in His infinite grace, uses us, but it is a bad thing to be occupied with ourselves and not with Him.<a name=122:15></a> We do not become acquainted with ourselves by thinking about ourselves; for, while we think of Him, the "I" disappears; one is in the light, where one is not when occupied with oneself.<a name=122:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will think me cold and hard, but this book is just a study, and one does not write a book when one is occupied with one's own history without self appearing far too much.<a name=122:17></a> I do not quite admit that all these things take place in a Christian, but when we are occupied with Jesus, the littleness of all that one is, and of all that one has done, remains in the shade and Jesus Himself stands out in relief.<a name=122:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not question the sincerity nor the christian truth of this book, but rather its christian reality.<a name=122:19></a> The harm which I see in it is the importance which it attaches to what one has done oneself -- the making and publishing a book about oneself; though I do not deny that more than one detail may be useful to other Christians.<a name=122:20></a> Still, the system which induces them to work because others have worked, instead of confiding in the Lord, because He sends us, and His love and His Spirit constrain us, is, according to my experience, a bad system.<a name=122:21></a> One works with a degree of lightness.<a name=122:22></a>

		I think Christians ought to be more heavenly; but two things are needed: first, that one should be broken, otherwise God has to act downwards, so to speak, in breaking.<a name=126:7></a> Indeed, this goes on in detail to the end.<a name=126:8></a> But there is a discovery of self, experimental discovery, which makes a total difference; otherwise, though, like Peter, we have been taught of God blessed truths, the flesh is not judged to the measure of them; what answers to them here is not received; and we may earn the name of Satan -- not savouring the things which be of God, but which be of men.<a name=126:9></a> But, secondly, we must be bearing about the dying, and Christ thus be the one spring of judgment, thought, and action.<a name=126:10></a> Then our state and mind is heavenly, for His life is so -- "Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.<a name=126:11></a>" That is, the Christ who is my life, is the object of that life, too, in the sense of His love; and this is the true christian state, Christ living in us.<a name=126:12></a> But it supposes occupation with Christ, or the Spirit is grieved.<a name=126:13></a> It is the old man put off, the new man put on, created after God, and the Holy Ghost dwelling in us.<a name=126:14></a> The body is dead because of sin, the Spirit life.<a name=126:15></a> This is the state, but it is realised as I have said, or rather the word says.<a name=126:16></a> Then heaven becomes -- is, the natural home of that life.<a name=126:17></a> Our conversation is in heaven.<a name=126:18></a> Now a Christian can live thus, and ought, and the flesh not intrude; only he must be much occupied with Christ, for Christ's own sake, otherwise, when there is no actual evil thought, his views, judgments, feelings, are natural ones, as to what he is passing through.<a name=126:19></a> They ought to be christian ones.<a name=126:20></a> Another thing is to be fully in the path of God's will.<a name=126:21></a> We cannot have power out of it, and so the enemy can .<a name=126:22></a>.<a name=126:23></a>.<a name=126:24></a> .<a name=126:25></a> Here grace may shew itself in the broken vessel, and there are very few of us that are not more or less in associations, the effect of the acting of our will, and so cast on grace.<a name=126:26></a> But then, that is not only sufficient, but much more abounds, and we God is all, after all.<a name=126:27></a>

		Dearest W Kelly, -- My impression is, for I do not dogmatise on such points, that "the third part" (Revelation 8: 7) is the Roman earth considered in its body in the West.<a name=128:1></a> In chapter 9.<a name=128:2></a> I apprehend there is the action of the Euphratean horsemen, so-called, against the powers of the Roman earth.<a name=128:3></a> In chapter 8.<a name=128:4></a> the judgments fall on the Roman earth.<a name=128:5></a> Chapter 12: 4 confirms the idea of this use of "third," because this is clearly, I suppose, the power of Satan in the Roman empire, and his tail draws down the third part of the stars and casts them to the earth; that is, a third part of the independent but smaller powers were reduced into subjection to Satan's power displayed in this form.<a name=128:6></a>

		[R T Grant] BELOVED BROTHER, -- Most glad was I to get your news of Canada, and more of them if you had had them to give.<a name=128:8></a> I first turn, on answering, to your scripture questions.<a name=128:9></a> As to the verse you quote (Romans 5: 16), the "many offences" is clearly, I think, to heighten the picture.<a name=128:10></a> The general argument seems to me to be this in direct connection with the two heads.<a name=128:11></a> The whole object is to bring in a new standing and nature in contrast with the old.<a name=128:12></a> The former part of the epistle, to chapter 5: 11, deals with sins and guilt: this with nature and the place we are in; not "what hast thou done?<a name=128:13></a>" but "where art thou".<a name=128:14></a> In order to this he goes up to the heads in which the standing is involved.<a name=128:15></a> He will have a new nature in the power of the Spirit of God, and the Holy Ghost dwelling in us, not a law applied to the old.<a name=128:16></a> In chapter 5, consequently, he shews that sin, its reign and power proved by death, was there when no law was, between Adam and Moses, where no transgression like Adam's was (Hosea 6: 7), and then says, You are not going to make grace have a narrower sphere than sin, and then he enhances the argument by bringing the "many offences" (which are especially -- not exclusively -- under law) as a greater difficulty, so that grace had to be stronger and greater than the evil.<a name=128:17></a> Having laid the two headships of sin and Its remedy as the real ground and truth of God's dealings, he adds with a "moreover" Chapter 5: 20), where it is the law came in as an occasional thing ( pareish'lqen ), "that the <i>offence</i> might abound, but where sin [not offence] abounded grace did much more abound [ uJpereperivsseusen ].<a name=128:18></a> But in all, when he comes in with the pollw' ma'llon which is a moral <i> fortiori</i>, not the excess in the thing, but that is in the many offences, and in the much more abounding.<a name=128:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to Ephesians 4: 11, 12.<a name=128:20></a> I do not think the ministry, etc is the object of the perfecting of the saints, but this last is the primary object, the rest the secondary.<a name=128:21></a> The perfecting the individual saints is divine and final, the ministry and edifying the body here in time, though the result be perpetuated in glory; and in all the Epistle the individual, as formed for God is set first; so in chapter 1, like Christ before God, and sons with Him, is the first thing; relationship with Him as Head being the body, comes in at the end of the chapter; even quickening together with Him is individual, though raising up together and making sit together in Him involves union; and in what follows the verse you quote, you have individuals first (vers.<a name=128:22></a> 13-15), and then the body in verse 16.<a name=128:23></a> Verses 13-15 being the perfecting the saints, verse 11 gives distinct ministries, verse 16 edification of the body by what every part supplies.<a name=128:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		... Here the work progresses rapidly, I trust on the whole soundly.<a name=128:25></a> There is a thirst for the word, and a general and l think serious attention to it.<a name=128:26></a> The week I left London there were three new meetings just sprung up in Northumberland.<a name=128:27></a> There are twenty-seven in Hampshire alone, I am told; I suppose on to 3,000 in London; but this all presses on one's spirit as to their being cared for, specially the young gatherings -- I trust casts one on the Lord, for it is a serious thing.<a name=128:28></a> In Scotland and Ireland also there is conversion and spread of the truth, and we are in general at peace, with much to be thankful for.<a name=128:29></a> What I dread is the world and want of devotedness, though still thoroughly looked down upon and disliked.<a name=128:30></a> Things are breaking up fast, all feel -- ours a kingdom which cannot be moved, that is a comfort; may it lead us to serve God reverently.<a name=128:31></a> There are two or three clergymen come out, others moved; but it is hard for them in England to get rid of the cloth.<a name=128:32></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have been helped in ministering, and scripture opens continually; but I find it hard, if moving about, and out of my den, to keep always close to the Lord, so that nothing but Christ should come out.<a name=128:33></a> I feel a Christian ought so to live to Christ as the motive and spring of all within, that nothing but Christ should come out -- be there to come out -- though the flesh be ever the same.<a name=128:34></a> But if we are in Him, He is in us and the flesh is for faith dead, and we have to carry about the dying daily.<a name=128:35></a> The Lord raises up more labourers.<a name=128:36></a> Would I were as simple as some of them.<a name=128:37></a> My age now hinders the kind of work in which, in one sense, I would be, and the multiplied occupation with so many in many places somewhat turns aside from direct work: that I feel, but His will is all.<a name=128:38></a>

		[To the same.<a name=130:1></a>] R T Grant, My meaning in saying the tie was broken was this, that God <i>never</i> allowed the Christian to break the tie; but when adultery was committed the one doing so had broken the tie, and the Lord allowed the other party to hold it to be broken and act on it by formal divorce not require it, but allowed it.<a name=130:2></a> The legalisation of it is submission to the powers that be, for common order, just as the divorce was in Jewish law.<a name=130:3></a> Things are so loose in many parts of the States as in Illinois, that Christians should be very particular.<a name=130:4></a> A person having left and being a long time away is not sufficient, as they may come back, and the tie had not been broken -- only that, as to criminality, after some seven years, in England the courts would not hold a person guilty of bigamy.<a name=130:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On the other hand, according to 1 Corinthians 7, I cannot doubt that the Christian, deliberately deserted by the unchristian partner, was in every way free, free that is to marry; but it assumes deliberate forsaking by the one who went away.<a name=130:6></a> The Christian was never to do it, and if obliged to leave, to remain unmarried or return.<a name=130:7></a> Romans 7: 3 has nothing, I think, to do with it; the case supposed is of being (not "married") to another man while the tie subsists; then she is guilty of adultery -- not, if the husband be dead.<a name=130:8></a> Divorce is not in question, but acts of sin while the marriage subsists.<a name=130:9></a> This is evident.<a name=130:10></a> Mark 10 does not annul Matthew 19: a man putting away his wife is looked at as his act or will.<a name=130:11></a> If he puts away, he has broken a tie God formed, by his own will; then marrying another is adultery.<a name=130:12></a> By act of sin the tie was broken already, and judicial divorce allowed.<a name=130:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If all had passed before conversion, I should take it as I found it; but when a person has merely gone off now, when a person is a Christian, I should be very slow to accept a marriage as in the Lord.<a name=130:14></a> Have they sought them out, or proof of the unfaithfulness?<a name=130:15></a> If so, let them obtain a divorce, and then they are free to marry.<a name=130:16></a> But if not, I could not accept their doing their own will, any more than the unfaithful one doing his.<a name=130:17></a> The marriage is not in the Lord, and it says even of widows -- "only in the Lord.<a name=130:18></a>" Matthew 5 is to me equally clear with chapter 19, but I think the person should obtain a divorce otherwise they remain legally married, and the new connection is concubinage.<a name=130:19></a> In any case forgiveness is allowed.<a name=130:20></a>

		I was aware of the state of -- , but it had got a good deal better: in one family I knew there was still a feeling of rancour.<a name=130:21></a> It was partly baptism working on partially healed griefs.<a name=130:22></a> One has to work on in grace seeing the evil to be overcome, even if the more we love the less we are loved.<a name=130:23></a> We work for Christ, and His love was perfect.<a name=130:24></a> I am afraid I take it sometimes too much for granted that we are so to work on, for Paul cultivated the affections of the saints much.<a name=130:25></a> Here, thank God, with such trials as are incident to working where the world and temptation and flesh are, there is blessing and progress.<a name=130:26></a> Though we are far short of what we might be, and I look for more, still we have much to be thankful for.<a name=130:27></a> Here in the west, where I was somewhat downhearted, I find things much better than I thought.<a name=130:28></a>

		As to my translation, it is all printed these two or three months, but a new edition of the French was transferring the notes and emendations, and in doing it they collected errata and we waited till they had gone through it to publish it, but I have the last sheet of French in hand, so that it will be soon out now.<a name=130:29></a> But I have no satisfaction in critical labours.<a name=130:30></a> -- wanted to publish an edition of what my translation has adopted as the reading to be accepted, but I declined.<a name=130:31></a> I feel no sufficient competency, though I have done the best I could, and am satisfied they have no adequate history of the text.<a name=130:32></a> I shall be glad, if the Lord permit to see you all; but, at past seventy, such of course is on every ground uncertain.<a name=130:33></a> kindest love to all.<a name=130:34></a>

		The full claim of God against sinners is that they should serve Him according to the relationship they stand in towards Him of creatures with a knowledge of good and evil: "The man is become as one of us, knowing good and evil.<a name=133:17></a>" He was bound to own God and his neighbour in everything due to them, and that as far as covetous lusts in his heart.<a name=133:18></a> Of this, even when men were not under it, the law was the perfect measure.<a name=133:19></a> But then, in fact, things went a great deal further, because there were dealings of men and dealings of God, both of which brought out what man was and imposed new obligations.<a name=133:20></a> Man did not like to retain God in his knowledge, and does not -- when he knew Him as God, as he did in Noah, set up devils to worship, and degraded himself below the nature of man.<a name=133:21></a> Now judgment is according to works, God taking account of the degree of light in pronouncing the judgment, see Luke 12.<a name=133:22></a> But judgment is according to works, and that is judicial exclusion from God's presence, whatever degree there may be in actual infliction of punishment.<a name=133:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is a great deal more behind.<a name=133:24></a> The mind of the flesh is enmity against God wholly and always, besides breaking through obligations, and leads to our doing this.<a name=133:25></a> Man was driven out of God's presence at the beginning, and besides future judgment for works, finds, when his eye is opened, that he is lost now- though this be concealed from those walking by sight, when the veil of sense and the show of this world is gone, he finds it is for ever.<a name=133:26></a> Now, though the law proved this to the divinely-taught mind, its grand proof was in the rejection of Christ -- "He shall convince the world of sin [not sense of sins, also true], because they believe not on me.<a name=133:27></a>" Up to the flood, the first world, it was just (with testimony from God) man left to himself, and God was obliged to bring in the flood.<a name=133:28></a> Then after it, government came in Noah; promise, Abraham; law, Moses; prophets; Christ; that is, dealings of God with men -- a complete system of probation which ended in the proof that he not only would not obey, but had no cloak for his sin, and had seen and hated God in grace -- "have seen and hated both me and my father.<a name=133:29></a>" Hence it is said, "Now once at the end of the world:" and the Lord -- "Now is the judgment of this word.<a name=133:30></a>" And Stephen, after reciting the call of promise in Abraham, declares, You have not kept the law, have rejected and persecuted the prophets, killed the just One, do always resist the Holy Ghost.<a name=133:31></a> There man's history ended.<a name=133:32></a> He was not only guilty, and subject to judgment, but his mind was <i>proved</i> to be enmity with God.<a name=133:33></a> This is not sins but sin, man not judged, but lost already, while judgment, which is not yet come, is according to works.<a name=133:34></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Christ was just personally exactly the opposite of this; He loved the Father and was obedient.<a name=133:35></a> But this was Himself and always; but He had a work to do according to the over-abounding love of God;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He died "for our sins according to the scriptures," and if a man believe in Him his sins are gone, forgiven and blotted out, the guilt and responsibility met.<a name=133:36></a> But when we look into the.<a name=133:37></a> work of the cross, we see more than this.<a name=133:38></a> He glorified God there, and when made sin.<a name=133:39></a> This was a wonderful mystery, perfect victim, spotless before God, perfect in obedience, perfect in absolute self-surrender, perfect in love to His Father, perfect in His love to us, able as a divine Person to sustain the weight of God's glory in the place of sin -- that is, as made sin for us, not only "in the likeness of sinful flesh," but "for sin.<a name=133:40></a>" "Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.<a name=133:41></a> If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him;" and Christ as Man is in glory at the right hand of God.<a name=133:42></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As the meat-offering He was fully tested by the fire of God's judgment in death, and was only a sweet savour: in the burnt-offering He was a sweet savour to God, but it was positive propitiation or atonement as glorifying God in righteousness, love, majesty, and everything He was, in the place of sin, as for sin: as the sin-offering He bore our sins, but that was not a sweet savour, though the fat was burnt on the altar.<a name=133:43></a> Christ was thus the Lord's lot as well as the people's lot.<a name=133:44></a> The bearing of our sins cleared the responsibility incurred, the guilt.<a name=133:45></a> This is true of His people; and the blood upon the mercy-seat has perfectly glorified God in all that He is, and laid the foundation for the accomplishing the counsels of God which were before the responsibility ever existed.<a name=133:46></a> God's love provided the Lamb, but God's righteousness required the propitiation, and by the cross alone the righteousness and love and majesty of God are secured, and what He is made known.<a name=133:47></a> The Son of man must be lifted up, and the Son of God is given.<a name=133:48></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards the epoch of completing the work, it is clear that as the wages of sin is death, He must die to complete that, but there was a far deeper truth in what that involved, and it was equally important that the drinking of the cup of God's forsaking should be over, because He was to give up His own spirit in peacefulness to God, as He did, laying it down of Himself when all was finished.<a name=133:49></a> The forsaking of God was of its own -- and the deepest character of the sufferings of the blessed Lord.<a name=133:50></a> This He felt anticipatively in Gethsemane, when He was not outwardly suffering; but it cannot be separated from death, because death bore the character of divine judgment against sin, and not an accident, so to speak, of mortality.<a name=133:51></a> But it is not in itself judgment; that is, the judgment to come.<a name=133:52></a> "It is appointed unto men once to die, and after this the judgment"; but all possible suffering combined against Christ: betrayal, abandonment, and denial, the bulls of Bashan and dogs also came against Him, and the power of Satan in death, the power of darkness, and His beloved people (Jews) assisting.<a name=133:53></a> This led up on the appeal in it to God, Psalm 22 -- to the sense of being in it forsaken of God -- He was heard from the horns of the unicorn; when all was finished He gave up His own spirit, commending it to His Father, crying with a loud voice, and actually died.<a name=133:54></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I could only rapidly trace in few words what presents itself to my mind in this, that there is nothing like in the history of heaven and earth -- that in which Christ could present a motive to His Father to love Him.<a name=133:55></a> "Therefore doth my Father love me.<a name=133:56></a>" All is looked at as a whole, for the blood and water came from a Christ already dead, and must have done so to be of avail for us.<a name=133:57></a> (Compare 1 John 5)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, I repeat, the more simply in our work with souls we put the blessed Lord's dying for our sins, the better; but to have a solid and deep work we must know ourselves, and sin as well as sins, what we are in flesh, as well as what we have done (so Romans from chapter 5: 12), but this goes on to our being crucified with Him, which is another truth .<a name=133:58></a>.<a name=133:59></a>.<a name=133:60></a> .<a name=133:61></a>

		My dear F Cavenagh, -- I have not much to say in replying to your letter, not from want of interest in your course, but that if you are clear as to going, it is but one thing, to have Christ always before you to work for Him and from Him.<a name=137:1></a> It is all important for us to get to the end of ourselves, not that we do not learn more daily; but there is a knowledge of self which makes us distrust self, and it is a detected and distrusted enemy, so that there is lowliness in our walk and it deepens its character a great deal.<a name=137:2></a> All our work feels the effect of our state, and a heart full of Christ and the seriousness of dealing with souls for eternity, which we feel when full of Him and speaking from Him, gives weight and unction to it.<a name=137:3></a> It is being emptied of self which enables us through grace, with watching and praying, to do this.<a name=137:4></a> But carrying about the dying of the Lord Jesus is the condition of this.<a name=137:5></a> The energy of Moses which killed the Egyptian did not stand before Pharaoh, though it shewed the energy which God would use when He had broken the will in connection with it.<a name=137:6></a> The energy is just the suited vessel, but we have to learn in the breaking of it, that the excellency of the power is of God.<a name=137:7></a> That is, no doubt, gradually learned, but there is a breaking down of self which lays the basis of it.<a name=137:8></a> Christ all, is the great secret of power, but when received comes the death of self which leaves the soul free to serve more individually.<a name=137:9></a>

		[From the French.<a name=138:1></a>] DEAR BROTHER, -- What constitutes the difficulty of the first chapter of the Epistle of John, and indeed of the whole Epistle, is that the doctrine there is presented in an abstract manner.<a name=138:2></a> But, on the whole, I believe that the thought of the Spirit is this: God is no longer hidden; we have communion with Him in the full revelation of His grace -- "with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ.<a name=138:3></a>" Under the law, God did not come out; man did not go into His presence.<a name=138:4></a> Now, the Father is revealed in the Son, and has given us a life in which we enjoy communion with Him.<a name=138:5></a> But then it is with God Himself -- no longer a veil -- and God is Light; He is perfectly pure, and reveals everything.<a name=138:6></a> Now, since there is no longer any veil, and God is revealed, we must walk in the light as He is in the light.<a name=138:7></a> But in this position we are perfectly cleansed by the blood of Jesus; then we enjoy fellowship one with another.<a name=138:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is this full revelation of God which is of the essence of Christianity; fulness of grace, introducing us into communion, and the Father known in the Son; but it is with God, if it is true, and God is light.<a name=138:9></a> The communion is with God, according to His nature, and without a veil.<a name=138:10></a> But, if we come to Him, it is as washed in the blood of Jesus Christ His Son, and we are before Him without a veil, white as snow: Now the Christian walks in the consciousness of this, having a nature suited to it; we are light in the Lord.<a name=138:11></a> But it must be in the light, as God Himself is in the light; everything is judged according to the revelation of God who judges all things.<a name=138:12></a> We are in the light as God is in the light.<a name=138:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These things are written that we sin not.<a name=138:14></a> If any man sin, the remedy is in the first verses of chapter 2.<a name=138:15></a> But the verses of which you speak teach us that we are in the light as God is in the light.<a name=138:16></a> Now, if we speak of fellowship when we are not there, we lie, for He is that light.<a name=138:17></a>

		[To the same.<a name=138:19></a>] [From the French.<a name=138:20></a>] -- - I do not at all doubt that the apostle, when he says (1 John 1), "We have fellowship one with another," speaks of the fellowship of saints among themselves.<a name=138:21></a> There are three elements of the christian life: the first is being in the light as God is in the light -- no veil.<a name=138:22></a> We must find ourselves in the presence of God fully revealed.<a name=138:23></a> If we cannot stand there, we cannot have intercourse with Him.<a name=138:24></a> The second is, that being thus in His presence, it is not, with us, the selfishness of the individual, but the communion of saints by the Holy Ghost, in the enjoyment of the full revelation of God Himself.<a name=138:25></a> The third is, that we are white as snow, so that we can be with joy in this light, which only makes manifest that we are all that the eye and heart of God desire in this respect -- what our hearts also desire, in His presence.<a name=138:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The idea is abstract and absolute; it is the value and efficacy of the blood.<a name=138:27></a> It is not only restoration.<a name=138:28></a> It is an efficacy, moreover, which is never lost.<a name=138:29></a> My soul once washed, I am always before God according to the efficacy of this blood.<a name=138:30></a> Restoration is rather by water, although in virtue of the blood.<a name=138:31></a> (See John 13.<a name=138:32></a> and the "red heifer," Numbers 19.<a name=138:33></a>) But here, it is the value of the blood in itself: and, mark well, if we are in the light as God is in the light, it is indeed a real state, but the apostle does not say, "according to the light.<a name=138:34></a>" It is our position now that the cross has revealed God without a veil.<a name=138:35></a> As this passage is generally interpreted, it ought to read: "If we <i>do not</i> walk <i>according</i> to the light, the blood cleanses us"; but there is no such thought.<a name=138:36></a> It is at the beginning of chapter 2 that we find provision made, as is necessary, in case of failure.<a name=138:37></a> I do not doubt that the light searches us; but here God does not see evil.<a name=138:38></a> He sees the man cleansed by the blood of Jesus.<a name=138:39></a> With verse 8 begins the consideration of known sin.<a name=138:40></a> Without doubt the blood cleanses us from everything; but when we think of the existence of sin in us, while knowing that the blood cleanses us from all, we are led to another truth of the gospel, it is that we are dead with Christ.<a name=138:41></a> (Romans 6; Colossians 2, 3; Galatians 2) This is for walk, and it is directed against the movement of this sin in the flesh.<a name=138:42></a> If sin has acted, we are brought to confess, not sin in the flesh, but what it has produced.<a name=138:43></a> (1 John 1: 9.<a name=138:44></a>) Then we are pardoned and cleansed.<a name=138:45></a> This is true at the beginning, but true also in the details of life .<a name=138:46></a>.<a name=138:47></a>.<a name=138:48></a> .<a name=138:49></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The characters that Christ takes in connection with these last days, are these: "The holy, the true.<a name=138:50></a>" Yes, that is the character He takes; that which He desires in His own, in their walk, when He is about to come.<a name=138:51></a> We have to watch over ourselves and over our brethren, that it may be so.<a name=138:52></a> I feel, for my part, that we have, in these days, to watch very specially as to this holiness, though it is always an essential thing for the children of God.<a name=138:53></a>

		... Evil is in the world, but we are in the hands of God: Christ came in after the evil, and has gained a complete victory over him who was their leader in it; thanks be to Him for it.<a name=138:54></a> He holds in His hands the keys of death and of hades, but the time has not yet come for taking away the evil from off the earth.<a name=138:55></a> God uses it for our good, but the evil is there.<a name=138:56></a><br>1871.<a name=138:57></a>

		W G Heney, As to we "cannot sin," John always looks at the truth abstractedly; so he says, "he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not.<a name=140:1></a>" But both are as born of God; he cannot sin because he is born of God.<a name=140:2></a> But the flesh is not born of God, but is of the flesh; and if we let it act we sin.<a name=140:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You may remark that there are two assertions in chapter 1.<a name=140:4></a> "If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar," for indeed God says all have sinned.<a name=140:5></a> Then "if we say that we have no sin"; this is more our state, not what we have done.<a name=140:6></a> If Christ be in us as the power of truth we are conscious that, though it may be inactive at the moment through grace, there is another element in us which is not of God -- which is sin.<a name=140:7></a> If we say there is none, "we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.<a name=140:8></a>" We may have it in our heads, but it is not in us.<a name=140:9></a> Further, you may remark in the beginning of chapter ii.<a name=140:10></a>, the case is supposed of our sinning, and the way grace then works in our behalf is stated: "If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father.<a name=140:11></a>" The righteous One and the propitiation are still before God, so that there is no imputation, but sin is not allowed; the work of God, humbling us and bringing to lowly confession, is wrought in the soul -- if need be, chastening employed -- to restore communion with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=140:12></a> When we confess we are forgiven.<a name=140:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is always the state of soul to which forgiveness applies (for here also John speaks abstractedly).<a name=140:14></a> When first brought to confess my sin, I receive forgiveness of sins viewed as guilt against God I am forgiven my sins.<a name=140:15></a> But there is an administrative forgiveness -- what the church can forgive.<a name=140:16></a> If one is excommunicated for some wickedness, it is not in this sense forgiven.<a name=140:17></a> (2 Corinthians 2: 7-10.<a name=140:18></a>) So God may forgive me in His government over me as a child, or chasten and punish me though still loving me, yea, because He loves me.<a name=140:19></a> This is what is taught in Job.<a name=140:20></a> The friends made it a question of righteousness, which was false, but it was discipline, and when he bowed, God's hand was taken off Him.<a name=140:21></a> Now when we have failed, our part is to humble ourselves and confess our fault, not with any thought that He imputes it to us as guilt in respect of eternal judgment.<a name=140:22></a> But God is always displeased with sin, and Christ's name dishonoured, and the grace of Christ and work of the Spirit in our hearts is, to lead us to bow our hearts before God and confess it.<a name=140:23></a> If one asks for forgiveness, as of a father whom we grieve to have displeased, it is all well, provided it is not mixed with the thoughts of God judging our persons for imputed guilt, because in this sense Christ has borne it and we shall not: but the great point is thorough confession and humiliation, and He does forgive.<a name=140:24></a> Asking forgiveness in such case is not spoken of in scripture, and it is apt, when our place in Christ and His work is not clearly known by divine teaching in the soul, to be mixed in the mind with the imputation of guilt.<a name=140:25></a>

		Rev Crawford, The intercession of Christ as priest in Hebrews is not for the forgiveness of sins, nor for sin properly at all, but for mercy and help in time of need, to succour them that are tempted, because all the sanctified are viewed as perfected by one offering.<a name=141:1></a>

		In 1 John 2 the advocacy is exercised when one has sinned, because there fellowship or communion is spoken of, and that is interrupted by sin.<a name=141:2></a> Forgiveness, in the sense of non-imputation cannot be sought by one set free in Christ, because he does know that sins are not imputed to him; but he confesses his sins, and fatherly forgiveness is given him.<a name=141:3></a> Confession goes much deeper into the conscience than mere asking forgiveness.<a name=141:4></a> There is a forgiveness which applies to Christians, and to Christians only -- what I may call administrative forgiveness, which has nothing to do with non-imputation or righteousness.<a name=141:5></a> See James 5: 15.<a name=141:6></a> Compare 1 John 5: 16 and 2 Corinthians 2: 10.<a name=141:7></a> In 1 John 2 the advocacy of Christ is founded on righteousness, and the efficacy of propitiation being already there in Christ.<a name=141:8></a> That pardon is plenary on coming to Christ is clear, and to refer to none else, in Hebrews 9, 10; it is largely reasoned out by the Holy Ghost.<a name=141:9></a> If not, such sins never could be cleared, as Christ cannot now die over again; and without shedding of blood is no remission.<a name=141:10></a> Christ must often have suffered.<a name=141:11></a> To make a difference of time is to confound the time of the Spirit's operation in bringing our souls to faith in Christ and His work with the work itself.<a name=141:12></a> All our sins were future when Christ bore them.<a name=141:13></a> The way in which "once for all," "for ever," and "no more" are used in Hebrews 9.<a name=141:14></a> and 10 is most distinct and characteristic.<a name=141:15></a>

		As to the Lord's Prayer, it must be remembered that it was given before the Lord's work was accomplished, and, of course, has the characteristics of the time in which it was given, because it was perfect.<a name=141:16></a> Nevertheless statements that accompany it shew that where the spirit of forgiveness does not exist, forgiveness does not belong, though we are imperfect, and no one in his senses would ask for forgiveness from God in the measure in which our forgiveness is perfect, though in spirit and purpose it is, according to the new nature.<a name=141:17></a> Christendom and Christians have forgotten that our place and standing is that of Christians, consequent on the accomplishment of the Lord's work, and the gift of the Holy Ghost thereupon.<a name=141:18></a> The things belonging to the Father's kingdom may be possessed, or partly still desired; but when the Lord's prayer was given it was not come, and the desires which Christ would teach to His disciples [would] be according to the position they were then in.<a name=141:19></a> Hence, also, the Lord's prayer is not in His name, for the work and plan on which that was founded was not yet accomplished.<a name=141:20></a><br>1871

		Dear G V Wigram, -- What you say of Hebrews is clear, but to compare the two cases, there are, I think, other elements to be taken into consideration.<a name=143:12></a> You have not in Hebrews at all the idea of righteousness and justifying.<a name=143:13></a> It is a people looked at, at any rate externally, as in relationship with God, and the question is between the temporary and ineffectual means of the law and the abiding efficacy of.<a name=143:14></a> Christ's work as gone to heaven, for a people thus in relationship.<a name=143:15></a> This last was eternal as its efficacy as redemption, inheritance, perfecting the man and his conscience as far as entering into the holiest went, by an offering once for all; even the Spirit is called the eternal Spirit; the covenant, the everlasting covenant; hence, as you say, the work done once for all, He is thereafter a priest in heaven, appearing for us and interceding for us, as to the difficulties of the way.<a name=143:16></a> Now all this is surely available for the chief of sinners.<a name=143:17></a> But here the thought is "the worshipper," those that come unto God by Him.<a name=143:18></a> God is not a judge, man is not justified, the righteousness of God is not revealed.<a name=143:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is otherwise in Romans.<a name=143:20></a> I have man individually, Jew or Gentile, a sinner proved such, and the law cannot justify.<a name=143:21></a> God sets forth a mercy-seat through the blood of Christ, a witness of grace, pardon, and the righteousness of God, and this is of perpetual efficacy.<a name=143:22></a> It shews righteousness in His passing by the sins of Old Testament saints, a thing He had done continually; but shews <i>His</i> righteousness in doing it, and now, that <i>He</i> is just, and the Justifier of him that is not, which seems a contradiction; but it is thus abiding because a witness of what He is, but while we are not, yet justifying us.<a name=143:23></a> Hence it is constant and of constant value.<a name=143:24></a> Hence it is not a question of priesthood, which is for the way, but that which being ever in the presence of God proves His justice while He justifies what is not just.<a name=143:25></a> It is God's character (I do not like the word) <i>constantly</i> good.<a name=143:26></a> I am not a worshipper but a convicted sinner there, yet held to be free from sin in judgment.<a name=143:27></a> Withal God sets it forth to sinners in grace, not for repeated cleansing, but to come and find a justification that cannot vary because God is always just, and the blood of Jesus always adequate .<a name=143:28></a>.<a name=143:29></a>.<a name=143:30></a> .<a name=143:31></a>

		The few brethren here are getting on well, and occasionally a soul is added.<a name=143:32></a> I get on much better than I hoped with my Italian.<a name=143:33></a> We have reading meetings in the evening, and I understand and make myself understood so as to develop scripture pretty well.<a name=143:34></a> But things are most sad all around -- the gathered meetings half dissolved, persons employed as far as they are paid, and morality, even among Christians, at the lowest ebb, upright souls often alone through the state of the meetings.<a name=143:35></a> Still there are a number of souls brought to the Lord, and I feel entire confidence in His goodness, but a faithful labourer is needed, as far as men can say, willing to work unknown of men and for the Lord.<a name=143:36></a> I can help a little those gathered and bring it before the Lord; but little more.<a name=143:37></a> He can do all.<a name=143:38></a>

		[T Loizeaux] [From the French.<a name=145:1></a>] VERY DEAR BROTHER, -- On beginning your letter, I soon thought that you had met these false teachers of whom you speak.<a name=145:2></a> It is true that we are only sealed by the Holy Spirit after having believed.<a name=145:3></a> But it is not then that we are born of God.<a name=145:4></a> If the presence of the Holy Spirit were life, every Christian would be an incarnation of the Holy Spirit.<a name=145:5></a> Our bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit that we have of God.<a name=145:6></a> Being born of God is another thing.<a name=145:7></a> We have not received, as to the state in which we find ourselves, the state purposed for us in the counsels of God, but we have all, subjectively, to be able to enjoy it.<a name=145:8></a> We have undoubtedly eternal life.<a name=145:9></a> When it is said, "this is the promise that he has promised us," it is no question of whether we have it or have it not, but what is the promise of God.<a name=145:10></a> But the testimony of God is that He has given us eternal life, and this life in His Son.<a name=145:11></a> He who has the Son has life, and he who has not the Son has not life.<a name=145:12></a> Christ is eternal life come down from the Father.<a name=145:13></a> Life eternal is indeed spoken of, as at the end (Romans 6), because eternal life such as God means by it in His fixed purpose, is in the glory when we shall be like Christ, but we are already quickened.<a name=145:14></a> John 5: 24; he has life, he is passed from death unto life, and the hour had come already.<a name=145:15></a> (Verse 25) Also John 3: 36.<a name=145:16></a> We are bound to reckon that we are alive unto God by Jesus Christ.<a name=145:17></a> "I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but (Christ liveth in me.<a name=145:18></a>" When we were dead He quickened us with Christ.<a name=145:19></a> We are seated only in Christ, and it is according to the power that worketh in us.<a name=145:20></a> God does not quicken in heaven wicked people who arrive there dead in sin!<a name=145:21></a> And the soul is not is the grave with the body.<a name=145:22></a> That which is born of the Spirit is spirit John 6: "verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.<a name=145:23></a>" And here it is by faith, and down here; he who eateth of this bread shall live eternally: if one does not eat it, one has not life in oneself "He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.<a name=145:24></a>" That is to say, resurrection is another thing; he has life, and made sure to him for eternity; he will be raised up at the last day.<a name=145:25></a> He that eateth of this bread shall live for ever.<a name=145:26></a> Nothing appears to me clearer than the doctrine of the word on this subject under various forms; born of the Spirit, quickened by Christ, by faith in receiving Him as bread of life.<a name=145:27></a> It ought to make the believer perfectly assured on this point.<a name=145:28></a> "He who has the Son has life.<a name=145:29></a>" Christ is my life.<a name=145:30></a> The gift of the Spirit is quite another thing, the seal of faith.<a name=145:31></a> After having believed I have been sealed.<a name=145:32></a> We are sons of God by faith in Christ Jesus, and because we are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into the heart, crying, Abba, Father.<a name=145:33></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another question is, if this faith is of me, or of God -- which I by no means doubt -- in me, but in that which grace has wrought in me, "He who stablished us with you in Christ, and who hath anointed us, is God.<a name=145:34></a>" "By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God.<a name=145:35></a>" (Ephesians 2: 8.<a name=145:36></a>) I know well it is said that "that" does not agree grammatically with faith -- be it so, but not with grace either- and to say that grace is not of ourselves is nonsense, for grace means of another, but one might say to oneself without doubt, but faith is on our part, as is said; this is why the apostle asserts, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God.<a name=145:37></a> As to the rest, it is another question.<a name=145:38></a> One is a child, barn of God, before being sealed.<a name=145:39></a> "Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.<a name=145:40></a>" God has begotten us of His own will.<a name=145:41></a> We do not beget ourselves.<a name=145:42></a> He does not believe in a life communicated, who does not believe that it is grace that communicated it.<a name=145:43></a> Wesleyans do not believe in a real life communicated: a result is produced by the operation of the Spirit, and this result can disappear and reappear.<a name=145:44></a> "Whosoever is born of God," having received this life, inasmuch as born of God, "sinneth not"; also "the wicked one toucheth him not.<a name=145:45></a>" In this life there is no sin, within it is the divine seed.<a name=145:46></a> There is no allurement for it in the things that Satan presents.<a name=145:47></a> As for deliverance and the seal of the Holy Spirit, it is not only having life that delivers me.<a name=145:48></a> It is indeed the Spirit of life in Jesus Christ that has set me free (further proof that I have life), but there is also redemption and the Holy Spirit, This is the order of these things, as I see them in the word.<a name=145:49></a> The beloved Saviour died for my sins; by grace I believe it and I possess the remission of sins.<a name=145:50></a> (I may have had life before by faith in His Person without understanding the efficacy of His death.<a name=145:51></a>) Thereupon being washed in the blood of Jesus, I am sealed by the Holy Spirit; thus there are strength and liberty: as in the Old Testament the leper was washed with water, then he was sprinkled with blood, and then anointed with oil.<a name=145:52></a> So says Peter, Be baptised for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.<a name=145:53></a> Thus with Cornelius, as soon as Peter spoke of the remission of sins by Jesus, the Holy Spirit descended on those who heard.<a name=145:54></a> We also find it in Romans 5.<a name=145:55></a> There is liberty.<a name=145:56></a> But for a solid state of soul there is another truth necessary, that we have died with Christ.<a name=145:57></a> It is no longer a question of sins but of the old man -- not of what we have done, but of what we are as children of Adam.<a name=145:58></a> That begins with Romans 5: 12: by the disobedience of one, it is said, we are constituted sinners.<a name=145:59></a> But having died with Christ, I am no longer in the flesh.<a name=145:60></a> Not only are the sins of the old man blotted out, but I am in a new position; I am in Christ instead of being in Adam.<a name=145:61></a> There there is no condemnation.<a name=145:62></a> Then he shews the state, what that means, the law of the Spirit, etc.<a name=145:63></a>, and then "what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of flesh of sin, and [as a sacrifice] for sin, condemned sin in the flesh"; but it is in death that this has taken place.<a name=145:64></a> Thus condemned it exists no longer for faith.<a name=145:65></a> I can say so because Christ risen having become my life, I recognise no longer the flesh as living, since He has really died for me -- He who only is my life, my I.<a name=145:66></a> I do not recognise the flesh; His death is valid for me to this result.<a name=145:67></a> (Romans 6: 10, 11)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is arrived at by the experimental knowledge that no good exists in me, then that sin in me is not I, but that it is too strong for me.<a name=145:68></a> Having learnt it, redemption and the power of the Spirit deliver me, and I know that I am in Christ.<a name=145:69></a> The apostle, in order to give it all its force, recounts this experience as made under the law (and it is always legal): it may be made after having learnt the remission of sins.<a name=145:70></a> I have life, then, very really as soon as I believe, as soon as I receive Christ, and I shall never perish -- a sheep quickened by Christ, never to be plucked out of His hands.<a name=145:71></a> For again John 10 proves it.<a name=145:72></a> am made free by redemption, and the power of the Spirit of God by whom I am sealed by virtue of this redemption, and I reckon myself for dead as to the flesh.<a name=145:73></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As for baptism, I confess that I have no taste for the discussions on this point.<a name=145:74></a> I have no doubt that each one ought to be baptised, but it is not the less true that it formed no part of the mission of Paul.<a name=145:75></a> The position of brethren according- to my view is to be in the midst of a mass of baptised people (saving rare exceptions), and they have to unite true Christians in the unity of the body as much as possible.<a name=145:76></a> It is the admission to the house of God where are found His blessings, as in the wild olive tree; as in Israel gone out of Egypt, see 1 Corinthians 10.<a name=145:77></a> It has been forgotten that there is a place where blessing is found, as well as personal grace.<a name=145:78></a> The servant (Matthew 24) was servant, and the Lord his Lord, and the servant was punished as such.<a name=145:79></a> I believe that according to the word children ought to be admitted where the blessings are.<a name=145:80></a> (1 Corinthians 7: 14) But I believe that God intended to leave baptism in the shade.<a name=145:81></a> The twelve were sent to baptise the nations.<a name=145:82></a> Paul was not sent to baptise.<a name=145:83></a> The ordinance has not been abrogated; and if any one believes he has not been baptised, he ought to be.<a name=145:84></a> What I fear is that in being occupied with the manner, Christ should become less the only object of the heart and of the thoughts, to attach an importance to an external ordinance, which really displaces it in christian thoughts.<a name=145:85></a> This is why I have never sought to lead any one to one view more than to another.<a name=145:86></a> The activity of those who have baptist views and the manner in which they have pushed their way of seeing, has produced a reaction, and a very large number of baptists have become paedo-baptists, which has annoyed the others, and this has caused this subject to be considered.<a name=145:87></a> What is to be desired is quiet, and then each will decide according to his conscience more or less enlightened by the word.<a name=145:88></a> I think I see the wisdom of God in leaving it in the shade.<a name=145:89></a> Paul, who said that he had not been sent to baptise, had a special revelation for the Supper, although that already existed: it is the expression of the unity of the body.<a name=145:90></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am at present in Italy.<a name=145:91></a> I know the language sufficiently for intercourse with the brethren.<a name=145:92></a> I do not preach.<a name=145:93></a> There is only a handful of brothers, but they are doing well.<a name=145:94></a> The state of the work in general is deplorable.<a name=145:95></a> The churches that the various sects have formed are full even of immorality.<a name=145:96></a> In many places men of conscience leave them, and they fall to pieces little by little; but there is, all the same, a good number of converted souls dispersed through the country, and, for my part, I am full of hope, but it needs a devoted workman, and more than one.<a name=145:97></a> There is no lack of paid workmen, but they are too much at the service of those who pay them.<a name=145:98></a> Peace to you, beloved brother.<a name=145:99></a> May God be abundantly with you.<a name=145:100></a>

		W Kelly, The passage is clearly wrong, I suspect doubly.<a name=149:1></a> There are two classes (1 Corinthians 1: 2): the church of God, saints by calling in contrast with Israel who had their place by birth as such.<a name=149:2></a> It is possible some may have deceived themselves, it is supposed possible in the epistle; but till proved they are taken to be true saints: then are added fall that in every place call upon the name of the Lord Jesus, both theirs and ours.<a name=149:3></a>" This is profession and individual, still, though only taken as profession, assumed to be sincere, unless there was ground to judge it false.<a name=149:4></a> The difference is that this is profession on man's part, taken as such: the others are treated as saints by God's calling, and of the assembly.<a name=149:5></a> Compare Ephesians 4: 4, 5, where we have an analogous classification.<a name=149:6></a> I remember this being before us.<a name=149:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the question for -- , I reply, we must distinguish between the work, in virtue of which sin is not at all imputed to them that believe, even as to those as to whom there was no question of baptism as Abraham, and the actual administration of the blessing upon earth -- both fully revealed and actually applied, the work on which it was grounded being accomplished.<a name=149:8></a> This revelation of remission is clearly pointed out.<a name=149:9></a> It is promised in the new covenant, recognised in the New Testament in the institution of the supper: "This is my blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many for the remission of sins": John the Baptist was to bring the "knowledge of salvation unto his people, by the remission of their sins.<a name=149:10></a>" The apostles were to remit sins and they would be remitted.<a name=149:11></a> And the commission in Luke, the one on which all preaching in the Acts is founded -- Peter's or Paul's -- is "that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name", and while in past times it had been forbearance, righteousness not being revealed, Christ being offered, righteousness in the remission of Old Testament sins was proved.<a name=149:12></a> God then not only announced this to souls individually (for, however many heard, it was individual) but set up a system on earth in which the new blessings were found, based on two ordinances, baptism and the Lord's supper -- one the entrance once for all, the other the continual memorial of the Lord's death till He come, and sign of the unity of the body.<a name=149:13></a> Of this last it is not our business to speak now.<a name=149:14></a> But baptism was the entrance into that system,<a href="#149:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> within the precincts of which all christian blessings were found as externally administered on earth; the first of which was the remission of sins, on the reception of which came also the sealing by the Holy Ghost.<a name=149:15></a> But even if this were extraordinarily given, as to Cornelius, still he was admitted in an orderly way to the enjoyment of the common blessings of Christians here below.<a name=149:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the first grand blessing needed was remission of sins; through this was knowledge of salvation and actual reception of it where it was received.<a name=149:17></a> Repentance and remission of sins were to be preached in Christ's name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.<a name=149:18></a> Peter does this when they are pricked in their hearts, and says these are the things looked for; if you repent and enter into this divinely-administered door of blessing, you will receive the promise of the Spirit.<a name=149:19></a> He does not say, Be baptised and you will receive the remission of sins; but be baptised with the baptism to this -- become a Christian where this blessing is found.<a name=149:20></a> They were baptised to it, as John Baptist, to Moses, to Christ, to Christ's death.<a name=149:21></a> It was the truth and fact they were brought to and owned, and then they would receive the Holy Ghost.<a name=149:22></a> It was the profession they came into.<a name=149:23></a> If true faith and repentance were there, they got the actual present administered remission: if it was not they did not, as Simon Magus.<a name=149:24></a> It may be a hardening but not blessing to him who is a hypocrite.<a name=149:25></a> For remission is not the fact of non-imputation by the death of Christ that Old Testament believers had; but an actual status into which a person enters.<a name=149:26></a> I may have forgiven my son perfectly in my mind, but he has not forgiveness till it is pronounced upon him.<a name=149:27></a> Here there is no outward sign.<a name=149:28></a> Where there is it may be abused to self deception, as 1 Corinthians 10.<a name=149:29></a> I use the simile to shew the difference between non-imputation on God's part, and administered or declared forgiveness.<a name=149:30></a> See the case of Nathan and David.<a name=149:31></a> Hence also the connection of forgiveness with discipline, where non-imputation is not at all the question.<a name=149:32></a> Hence when Paul was converted it is said to him, "Arise and be baptised and wash away thy sins.<a name=149:33></a>" He entered then into an actually administered forgiveness.<a name=149:34></a> "Wash away thy sins" is of course a figure: it is not putting away the filth of the flesh does it.<a name=149:35></a> But I enter by it into that which is proclaimed as the first blessing of Christianity into which I enter, becoming a professed Christian.<a name=149:36></a> If faith is there, my conscience is perfect according to the Christian system, and the other blessings follow.<a name=149:37></a> If not, and there is profession I am in the case of Simon Magus or 1 Corinthians 10; but I hare been baptised to that.<a name=149:38></a> In Acts 2 and 22.<a name=149:39></a> the call is addressed to persons publicly under the power of the revelation and word of Christ, who are then told what to do to obtain the blessings of Christianity actually here on earth -- the path to perfect ones above.<a name=149:40></a> This must not be forgotten, for then they did, and for the first time, enter into the blessings attached to Christianity on earth.<a name=149:41></a> Hence Peter can say the like figure saves us, taking care, as the proposition is general, to shew it was not simply the outward sign that did it.<a name=149:42></a> Hence when Peter addresses those pricked in heart by his word he puts the whole thing, on the inquiry what to do, according to the mission in Luke.<a name=149:43></a> They inquired for a good conscience and got it.<a name=149:44></a> They were baptised to this truth and administered fact -- the remission of sins, and received then the gift of the Holy Ghost.<a name=149:45></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am not aware that I can add more.<a name=149:46></a> It is always important to look at the context.<a name=149:47></a> If a person being not a professed Christian -- a Jew, for example, or a heathen -- was convinced that Jesus was the Christ, or Son of God, and would not be baptised (the case has happened to me), I could not say his sins were washed away or that he was saved.<a name=149:48></a> (See Mark 16: 16.<a name=149:49></a>) But I see nothing of quickening spoken of in connection with baptism.<a name=149:50></a> The question raised is sins, not life -- washing away or remission.<a name=149:51></a> It is not a question of non-imputation of sin, nor is it before men; but the administration of forgiveness here on earth, as the privilege conferred freely on the conscience in Christianity.<a name=149:52></a> Christianity administers forgiveness as a present actual thing.<a name=149:53></a> I enter into this position by baptism; though being sacramental it may be merely a form, as stated above.<a name=149:54></a>

		[H M Hooke] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- Thank you very much for your letter and account of Ireland.<a name=153:12></a> I bless God with all my heart for the blessing He has given, and for the part you have had in it through [grace].<a name=153:13></a> Be assured of my unfeigned sympathy in your proposed union.<a name=153:14></a> Always a serious thing, it is doubly so for you, occupied as you have been in the Lord's work: for it is, and specially in such cases, a help or a great hindrance, even where there is genuine affection, and the Lord is not individually the first object, because each will have the other for themselves.<a name=153:15></a> I trust it is not so with .<a name=153:16></a> I pray you may be blessed.<a name=153:17></a> It is a serious thing beginning, when in the work, life afresh (so to speak); but it may be a helpmeet and a resource in solitary labour.<a name=153:18></a> I am passing out of the world even humanly, though at present gradually, for though fagged I am very well, but have only to say, my salvation is nearer than when I believed.<a name=153:19></a> You are, so to speak, entering into it, for it is a new life.<a name=153:20></a> To carry your wife to a home, be she ever so devoted, is another thing from going as a preacher.<a name=153:21></a> This is a serious thing, I do not mean not a right thing: it may be the very best thing possible for you: I only say a serious thing -- makes me think of you and pray for you as I do, that God may make it minister in much blessing to you, and even to your work.<a name=153:22></a> If you go to Australia and New Zealand, it may be a great thing for you.<a name=153:23></a> The gracious Lord guide and bless you abundantly in your soul and in your work!<a name=153:24></a> .<a name=153:25></a>.<a name=153:26></a>.<a name=153:27></a> The doors are open here comparatively, and even with Roman Catholics; at Vevey there was decided blessing.<a name=153:28></a> This is the most sick part of the work, though there are many gatherings, and some large ones, but little spiritual energy and detachment from the world.<a name=153:29></a> We have had some very nice young men here, and the spirit of all has been excellent, and some with very considerable gift.<a name=153:30></a> But what I look for is devotedness; with that, looking to the Lord, blessing will come.<a name=153:31></a> Our studies have been happy, I trust profitable.<a name=153:32></a> Their presence has cheered the neighbouring gatherings and roused them.<a name=153:33></a>

		Dear Miss Loudown, -- Be assured you shall have my prayers, as I am sure you will of many other saints.<a name=154:1></a> And as I said to -- , not only then but now, it is a serious position in which you are placed, not only, as it ever is, the influence that a wife exercises on a Christian, in danger (as the apostle teaches us) of caring for the things of the world to please his wife, but the rather in the case of a workman of the Lord, and who has been blessed as such.<a name=154:2></a> You may be blessed to your husband if God graciously leave you together in this poor world, as strengthening and comforting and encouraging him, and praying for him in the weariness and trials which accompany the service.<a name=154:3></a> But do not seek to relax his energy.<a name=154:4></a> A wife sometimes likes to have her husband for herself, and when her husband is the Lord's labourer, it is a great evil.<a name=154:5></a> I have known a wife spoil a labourer, and a husband as to herself too, in this way.<a name=154:6></a> A husband is bound to care for his wife, consider her, and do anything but neglect her: it is surely most evil and sad when he does.<a name=154:7></a> But the wife of a labourer for the Lord must put his work and labour before herself; or rather it should be herself too, and this can only be when she lives with and for the Lord.<a name=154:8></a> The world claims it, and officers' wives must take their chance, so to speak, and cannot help themselves; but sometimes we grudge so much to the Lord.<a name=154:9></a> But a wise wife who seeks first the Lord herself, puts Him first for her husband, and does not love him the less: it is a bond; and her husband will honour and value her, and so will the Lord too.<a name=154:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another danger is where a wife likes to see her husband made much of -- very natural; but I have seen labourers wholly spoiled by this -- creating ill-feeling in his mind, because he had not the importance she thinks he ought to have, and irritating him against others.<a name=154:11></a> Let her honour him -- all right -- and minister to his service all she can, but remember he is the Lord's servant, and keep peacefully in her own place, not meddling with his relationship to his labour, or a rock amongst whom he may be, only helping as she may very much in it, and leaving it there.<a name=154:12></a> Women often see things or motives clearer than men; but if they act by insinuations or small means in these things, it is ruinous.<a name=154:13></a> Let them be with the Lord for themselves if their own pride is wounded (for it is their own) in their husband.<a name=154:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having said these two or three words, with the privilege of an old man before whom many things, and sometimes sorrowful ones, have passed, I have only to beg you to be assured that I have done so, as I now write, really in sincere sympathy and desire of a full blessing.<a name=154:15></a> May He be with you!<a name=154:16></a> Many and rich blessings flow from Him in these channels, if we look to Him in them.<a name=154:17></a> Trials?<a name=154:18></a> Yes.<a name=154:19></a> God sanctions fully all these natural relationships, but sin being in the world, sorrow will follow in their track; but the gracious Lord is come where sin and sorrow had come, no doubt to raise us to far higher blessings, but not to forget us in the path of trial in which we walk down here.<a name=154:20></a> He could be moved with compassion when He saw the sorrow, and He has learned His lesson well, and can look to and feel for us now.<a name=154:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But your privilege is to live with your husband as heirs together of the grace of life; and then all will be well even in a world of sorrow; and I can only trust you may find abundant communion with him and joy, and joy together in it.<a name=154:22></a> Make, and may he make, the Lord the first object, the real bond; and the rest will come.<a name=154:23></a> And remember, a labourer's wife (as indeed any) must be first with the Lord, and then not be curious about his labour, and all that passes; but his comfort and encouragement, his cheer in it, and sharer in his sorrows because she lives with the Lord.<a name=154:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Very truly, yours in Him.<a name=154:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You hardly expected such a line as this.<a name=154:26></a> However, I was led on, and beg you to consider it as a proof of interest in your happiness.<a name=154:27></a>

		[G Biava] [From the Italian.<a name=157:1></a>] DEAR BROTHER, -- Now for the questions.<a name=157:2></a> Satan is a fallen creature, and he does not possess either omniscience or omnipotence -- John 8: 44, and probably, Ezekiel 28: 17, where many Christians believe that Satan is represented under the figure of the king of Tyrus, and I think too they are right.<a name=157:3></a> However this may be, John 8: 44 is a distinct testimony.<a name=157:4></a> But Satan has a whole multitude of demons under his authority, so much so, that in the poor Gadarene there was a legion: he is the prince of the demons.<a name=157:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With respect to the knowledge of thoughts, he does not know them intuitively, as God does; but he knows as a spirit full of intelligence and subtlety, who discerns with the greatest clearness the motives of the heart, and who has gained experience by the practice of many thousand years: but I believe that he understands nothing of the power of love.<a name=157:6></a> He was able in his malice to raise up the Chaldeans, etc.<a name=157:7></a>, through desire of plunder, against Job; but not in any way knowing the purpose of God to bless him by this means, he did nothing but fulfil it.<a name=157:8></a> He did all that he could to get Christ put to death, but he only fulfilled the wonderful purpose of God for our salvation.<a name=157:9></a> However, when he has to do with the evil heart of man, the case is different.<a name=157:10></a> He can present objects to awaken lust.<a name=157:11></a> If we reckon ourselves to be dead, dead to sin, and alive unto us, God through Jesus Christ our Lord, he is not able to tempt us, at least, the temptation remains without effect; but if the flesh is not held as dead, then he can present objects which the flesh likes, and suggest to a man the means of satisfying his lusts.<a name=157:12></a> Thus he put it into the heart of Judas to betray Jesus for a little money.<a name=157:13></a> But man is responsible, because without lust Satan could do nothing: he has nothing to offer to the new man, or if he offers anything, it only produces horror in the soul; the soul suffers as Christ suffered at the sight of evil in this world, or else it overcomes as Christ overcame in the wilderness.<a name=157:14></a> But, when the soul is not set free, he can indeed insinuate wicked thoughts, and unbelieving thoughts, and words of blasphemy, in such a way that these words and thoughts seem to proceed from the man himself.<a name=157:15></a> Nevertheless if the man is truly converted, we always find that he has a sense of horror at the things that arise in his mind, and we see that they are not really his own thoughts.<a name=157:16></a> If he is not converted he does not distinguish between the demon and himself, as we find in the gospels.<a name=157:17></a> But also when he is converted, it is a proof that he has opened the door to the devil by sin, hidden sin it may be, or by negligence.<a name=157:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Further, Satan is the prince of this world, and its god, and he governs the world by means of the passions and lusts of men; and he is able to raise up the whole world against Christians, as he did against Christ, and so try their faith.<a name=157:19></a> He can seek to mingle truth and error, and thus deceive Christians if they are not spiritual; and also as the demon at Philippi did, to get Christians mixed up with the world in order to destroy the testimony of God; he can change himself into an angel of light, but "the spiritual man discerneth all things.<a name=157:20></a>" Satan has but little power over us, if we walk humbly, close to the Lord, following faithfully the word of God, having Christ as the only object of the heart.<a name=157:21></a> Satan knows well that he has been conquered; therefore it is said, "Resist the devil and he will flee from you.<a name=157:22></a>" His influence in the world is very great through the motives of the human heart, and he acts on men through each other; likewise, from the rapidity of his operations and actions, he appears to be everywhere; and then he employs a great multitude of servants who are all wicked; but in fact he is not present everywhere.<a name=157:23></a> Now God is really present, and if we are under the influence of the Spirit of God, and the conscience is in the presence of God, Satan has no power.<a name=157:24></a> "He that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not.<a name=157:25></a>" However things may be with us, if we are truly the children of God he will fulfil the counsels of God with respect to us; it may be by chastisement if need be.<a name=157:26></a> But God knows all things, He in the most absolute sense penetrates everywhere: He orders all things -- Satan's efforts even -- for our good; and if we are armed with the whole armour of God, the darts of the evil one do not reach the soul.<a name=157:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not know whether these few lines as to the devil are sufficient.<a name=157:28></a> The question is not a new one, but the manner of Satan's working is not told us, but it appears in the gospel history.<a name=157:29></a> I have not spoken about possession.<a name=157:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have had good meetings at Nismes, and I have visited those in the Cvennes, except St.<a name=157:31></a> Andr, where the road was broken up by the effects of the rain.<a name=157:32></a> I have never had such large meetings, and such solemn ones.<a name=157:33></a>

		[G Biava] [From the Italian] [To the same] It is asked, First, If the holiness of Christ is imputed as righteousness?<a name=159:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Second.<a name=159:2></a> If the distinction between our holiness in Christ and practical holiness is scriptural?<a name=159:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Third.<a name=159:4></a> If, when Christians are called holy, it is a positional holiness, or a practical holiness?<a name=159:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first question is somewhat indefinite, since it speaks of the holiness of Christ, and then of righteousness without saying of Christ, so it does not appear whether you mean righteousness simply, or the righteousness of Christ.<a name=159:6></a> The word says always simply that righteousness is imputed, or that faith is imputed for righteousness, not the righteousness of Christ.<a name=159:7></a> But I will answer the substance of the question, not its form.<a name=159:8></a> Christ's holiness is not imputed.<a name=159:9></a> The only passage that can appear to resemble this doctrine is 1 Corinthians 1: 30, but imputation is not spoken of there.<a name=159:10></a> It is not possible to impute redemption.<a name=159:11></a> It is in Christ, and through Christ, that these are according to the will of God, how is not told us.<a name=159:12></a> "Of him are ye"; this is the new man, whence he comes.<a name=159:13></a> Then Christ is made of God unto us wisdom.<a name=159:14></a> We do not find these things elsewhere.<a name=159:15></a> We do not find the true character of our wisdom, of our righteousness, of our christian holiness, or of redemption elsewhere than in Christ, and in Christ alone.<a name=159:16></a> When I possess Christ, I possess in Him the wisdom of God.<a name=159:17></a> He Himself is the wisdom of God; I do not seek wisdom elsewhere, and the wisdom of God is not to be found elsewhere.<a name=159:18></a> He is my righteousness before God; I am accounted righteous according to the righteousness of God by faith in Christ.<a name=159:19></a> If I seek for the truth, the sum total, the divine character, of holiness, I find it only in Christ: this holiness is presented to me by God in Christ.<a name=159:20></a> In Christ only is redemption, final redemption to enter glory.<a name=159:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here it is needful to distinguish between the words used for holiness and sanctification in the New Testament: aJgiwsuvnh is the thing itself, the habit -- once, aJgiovth", Hebrews 12: 10, the holiness of God Himself -- aJgiasmov" the word used in 1 Corinthians 1: 30.<a name=159:22></a> The word in this form signifies the result worked out, the sum of what is produced in us by the Holy Ghost.<a name=159:23></a> Now Christ is the model, the measure, the perfection of it.<a name=159:24></a> Inasmuch as we possess Christ as life, we possess this holiness.<a name=159:25></a> The life which we possess is a perfectly holy life, and as we are in Christ God does not see sin in us.<a name=159:26></a> But Christ Himself, as has been said already, is the perfect expression of the character, of the perfection, of holiness in man; and although the life which is in us is a holy life, the outcome in our thoughts, in our acts, in our words, in our relation to everything is not produced in its perfection; but our desire is not to lower the standard of it, but to reach it.<a name=159:27></a> It is ours in Christ, not yet in practice, not yet subjectively.<a name=159:28></a> The new man desires that in everything his whole being should answer to the model he knows in Christ.<a name=159:29></a> In this life the result is not attained to, but the Christian has no other model, no other substance of sanctification for the soul but Christ Himself.<a name=159:30></a> Christ is for him, from God, the substance of that which be longs for; because Christ, who is his model, is his life already.<a name=159:31></a>

		Thus the answer to the first question furnishes the reply to the second.<a name=159:32></a> It is true that God sees us in Christ, and He sees only the new man, when acceptance is in question: "He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel.<a name=159:33></a>" But scripture does not speak of our holiness in Christ.<a name=159:34></a> The life we have received is perfectly holy, and <i>I</i> do not live, but Christ lives in me.<a name=159:35></a> But here are two truths which must be made plain.<a name=159:36></a> First, if Christ is our life we are consecrated to God, set apart for Him, according to the right which He possesses through the work of redemption, and the grace that has won us for Him -- wholly consecrated to Him personally.<a name=159:37></a> Thus we are personally sanctified, set apart for God, but as a matter of fact all our thoughts, our motives, have not Christ as their object; so that in fact we are not perfected in sanctification.<a name=159:38></a> In personal sanctification there is no progress, we belong wholly to Christ according to the value of His work and the claim which He has over us, and according to the holy life which is the true "I" of the heart.<a name=159:39></a> But, Christ being the perfect expression of this life in man, much is wanting in us in respect of this perfection, and through the operation of the Holy Ghost we become -- we ought to become, at least -- while looking at Christ glorified, increasingly like Christ, more holy, as regards practical holiness.<a name=159:40></a> We possess then the " aJgiwsuvnh " in the life of Christ in us; we do not possess the " aJgiasmov"", the practical result as it has been manifested in Christ; it is developed daily in communion with Christ.<a name=159:41></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second principle which it is necessary to call attention to is this: that it is not the whole truth that we have received a new life in receiving Christ.<a name=159:42></a> The Christ whom we have received has been crucified, has died, and risen again; thus I reckon myself to be dead, and the old man as crucified, as not in existence, although it continues to exist.<a name=159:43></a> The doctrine is according to the authority and the truth of God in Colossians 3: 3.<a name=159:44></a> "Ye are dead.<a name=159:45></a>" The reckoning of faith is in Romans 6: 11, "Reckon ye also yourselves to be dead unto sin"; the realisation is in 2 Corinthians 4: 10.<a name=159:46></a> (compare Galatians 2: 20; Romans 6: 6, 7: 6; Galatians 2: 19, where we read, "dead to the law," Galatians 6: 14.<a name=159:47></a>) Thus we are dead to sin, to the law, to the world, crucified with Christ, reckoned to be dead according to the word of God, and reckoning ourselves dead.<a name=159:48></a> Our duty is to make good this truth, so that nothing except the life of Christ should be manifested in our bodies, in our mortal flesh, that our whole life may be the manifestation of the life of Christ in us, and of nothing else.<a name=159:49></a> The connection between this truth and holiness in our relationship with God, and practical holiness, is easily understood.<a name=159:50></a> This is the third question already before us.<a name=159:51></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Christian is called holy because he is set apart for God absolutely, according to the rights won by Christ in His death, and made good when he is born again, and thus set apart in a real way; and more perfectly, and with more intelligence, when he is sealed by the Holy Ghost, as cleansed by the blood of Christ.<a name=159:52></a> Then he is sanctified in his relationship with God, and, in fact, as to the new man; also as we have seen, the old man is held to be dead.<a name=159:53></a> Thus when Christians are called holy, it is indeed the expression of a relationship with God, but this relationship is formed by the gift of life, and founded on the fact that Christ has purchased them by His death.<a name=159:54></a> But there is no other relationship, and when a man calls himself a Christian he calls himself holy, consecrated to God, set apart from the world for God.<a name=159:55></a> It has likewise been the will of God that a church should be formed on the earth, and all who are introduced into the church according to the ordinance of God are accounted holy.<a name=159:56></a> They deceive themselves terribly if they have not life, but according to their profession they are holy; such is their relationship as to their position.<a name=159:57></a> But when the word says "saints," it is of course supposed that they have been really born again, and sanctified by the Holy Ghost, the possibility of a false profession excepted.<a name=159:58></a> The word "saint" is therefore the name of a relationship; that is, that a man is set apart for God; but this relationship, if it is a true one, is formed by the power of the Holy Spirit, and by the word according to the order appointed by God for the external manifestation in the world of this relationship.<a name=159:59></a> Now it is worth while to remark, that sanctification is attributed to each of the three Persons of the Trinity: to God and to the Father, Hebrews 10: 10; Jude l; it is by the blood of Christ, and by the offering up of His body, Hebrews 13: 12; 10: 10, 29; by the Holy Ghost, 2 Thess 2: 13; 1 Peter 1: 2.<a name=159:60></a> This is in various aspects, naturally: there are the counsels and the will of God the Father; through the offering of Christ in order to redeem them to be sanctified; by the power of the Holy Ghost to set them apart in fact: we may add, by the word, as the means employed by the Holy Ghost.<a name=159:61></a> It is important to draw the reader's attention to the use of the word "sanctification" in the Epistle to the Hebrews.<a name=159:62></a> Sanctification by the Holy Ghost is never spoken of there, but by the will of God, by the offering of Christ, and by His blood; because Christ died for the nation, and as many as received Jesus as the Christ were reckoned as being, as it were, a part of the nation that belonged to God according to the offering of Christ; not that it does not treat of the true value of the offering for those who believe, but the nation sanctified by the blood of the covenant is always in view, and not the operation of the Holy Ghost in the individual.<a name=159:63></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The saints then in the New Testament are accounted as having entered into a new relationship with God through the blood of Christ, set apart for God.<a name=159:64></a> This is the order according to God, but it is always supposed that this relationship is founded on reality, save to demonstrate its falseness; only that sanctifying by the blood of Christ is used in a more general, external way: nevertheless it is held to be real if the contrary is not demonstrated.<a name=159:65></a> Christians are called holy in Romans 1: 7, 1 Corinthians 1: 2, but in chapter 10 of the latter epistle it is supposed possible that admission to this relationship may have taken place without the possession of life.<a name=159:66></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As some confusion exists with respect to progress in sanctification, I add that in the setting us apart for God by the blood and the new birth -- in the entrance into the relationship (that is, sanctification of the person) there is no progress; but in the development of the life through the knowledge of Christ, and in conformity to the model revealed in Christ, the word speaks distinctly of progress.<a name=159:67></a> "Follow after holiness," it is written in Hebrews 12: 14.<a name=159:68></a> We "are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord.<a name=159:69></a>" (2 Corinthians 3: 18.<a name=159:70></a>) "Now the very God of peace sanctify you wholly.<a name=159:71></a>" (1 Thessalonians 5: 23.<a name=159:72></a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now sanctification is used in these two ways in the New Testament, and when it speaks of sanctification and justification together, sanctification is placed first, and is used not for progressive sanctification but for the setting apart for God.<a name=159:73></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have spoken entirely with a practical view, without considering the responsibility of those who are in the christian position without reflection.<a name=159:74></a> All who are baptised are responsible as to their position and ought to be really holy; they are externally set apart for God; but I am not treating here of the state of the church, but simply of the question, What is sanctification according to scripture.<a name=159:75></a> The children of a christian man or woman are called holy in contrast with the children of a Jew, who if the wife was from among the Gentiles was rejected as unclean and as unworthy of Jewish privileges.<a name=159:76></a> But these things are not the object of the present observations.<a name=159:77></a>

		My Dear Brother -- I just got your note, and write a line in reply.<a name=164:1></a> We use words so inexactly that it is necessary to explain, not to have endless discussion.<a name=164:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Usually when we speak of <i>free</i> and <i>can</i> -- that is, the absence of compulsion, and the presence of power are confounded.<a name=164:3></a> I say 'every one can come to the meeting,' meaning it is open to every one.<a name=164:4></a> I am told it is not true, for such an one has broken his leg and cannot.<a name=164:5></a> I take a plain case, to shew what I mean.<a name=164:6></a> Thus where the Lord says, "No one can come to me except the Father which hath sent me draw him;" it is not that God prohibits or hinders, but that man is so wicked in will and corrupt, that unless a power outside himself act on him he cannot come -- he is never morally so disposed.<a name=164:7></a> Man is perfectly free to come now as far as God is concerned, and invited to come, yea, besought; and the precious blood of Christ there on the mercy-seat, so that moral difficulty is removed by God's own grace as regards the holy One receiving a sinner.<a name=164:8></a> In this sense he is perfectly free to come.<a name=164:9></a> But then there is the other side, man's, own will and state.<a name=164:10></a> There is no will to come, but the opposite.<a name=164:11></a> Life was there in Christ.<a name=164:12></a> "Ye will not come to me that ye might have life.<a name=164:13></a>" "All things are ready, come to the marriage," and "they all <i>with one consent</i> began to make excuse.<a name=164:14></a>" Man does not wish to be with God.<a name=164:15></a> "There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.<a name=164:16></a>" "Wherefore when I came was there no man, when I called was there none to answer.<a name=164:17></a>" "The carnal mind is enmity against God.<a name=164:18></a>" The crucifixion of the Lord is the proof that man would not have God, when come in mercy and relieving even every present misery -- "For my love I had hatred:" "They hated me without a cause:" "Now they have both seen and hated both me and my Father.<a name=164:19></a>" And the Lord gives the reason.<a name=164:20></a> Whatever the love, and it was infinite and perfect, God is Light as well as Love, "and men loved darkness rather than light.<a name=164:21></a>" They reject a love that humbles their pride, as they detest a light which awakens their conscience; henceforth we find "as many as received him to them gave he right to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name, who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.<a name=164:22></a>" It is simple nonsense to talk of freedom when applied to man's actual condition, if he is already inclined to evil; admitting him more than free to come, invited and besought by every motive, all made ready -- but which proves that he <i>will</i> not, and that no motive induces him.<a name=164:23></a> I have yet <i>one son</i>, says God, but that is over.<a name=164:24></a> To say he is not inclined to evil, is to deny all scripture and all fact; to make him free to choose he must be as yet indifferent, indifferent to -- having no preference for -- good and evil, which is not true, for evil lusts and self-will are there, the two great elements of sin, and if it were true would be perfectly horrible.<a name=164:25></a> But there is more, when he does will good, evil is present with him- how to perform that which is good he finds not.<a name=164:26></a> There is a law in his members bringing him into captivity to the law of sin which is in his members.<a name=164:27></a> No doubt, thank God, there is <i>deliverance</i>, deliverance in another; but deliverance is not freedom, but what is granted and effected by another, because I have learned by experience under divine teaching that I am <i>not</i> free and cannot free myself.<a name=164:28></a> Hence in Romans 6, where this question is treated in its roots, we are set free by being dead, the Adam nature crucified with Christ.<a name=164:29></a> <i>Then</i> he can say, but not before, "Yield ye yourselves:" a blessed and true principle when I reckon myself dead to sin and alive to God -- not in Adam, but in Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=164:30></a> This is resumed in chapter 8: 2, 3.<a name=164:31></a> "The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death"; so that I was not free before I had Christ.<a name=164:32></a> And he adds, "For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh.<a name=164:33></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Freedom is the fruit of deliverance by Christ.<a name=164:34></a> First, in His death the old man, sin in the flesh, is dead for faith; we are crucified with Him, and I have life in the power of the Spirit in Christ, and then I am free.<a name=164:35></a> But the facts of man's state, and the scriptural history of his responsibility, put this matter on another ground altogether: and first that history which will bring out more clearly the facts of his state.<a name=164:36></a> The purpose of God was always in the second Adam, not in the first.<a name=164:37></a> The first promise also was to the seed of the woman, not to Adam, who was not that.<a name=164:38></a> The seed of the woman was to destroy Satan's power, as Adam had succumbed to it.<a name=164:39></a> All promises are made to Christ, Israel as a chosen people, or to Abraham and to his seed -- none to man as such.<a name=164:40></a> But God began with responsibility first in the first Adam, and not with purpose or promise.<a name=164:41></a> And this responsibility was fully dealt with in every way, I mean now after the fall, without law, under law, and after the prophets by Christ's coming in grace according to the word.<a name=164:42></a> "Having yet therefore one Son, his well-beloved, he sent him also last unto them.<a name=164:43></a>" Thus man's responsibility was fully dealt with, and the Lord says, "Now is the judgment of this world.<a name=164:44></a>" Stephen sums this up, saying (Acts 7), "You have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it; which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted and slain?<a name=164:45></a> who testified beforehand of the coming of the Just One, of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers; ye do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did so do ye.<a name=164:46></a>" And one, full of the Holy Ghost, thereon goes up into heaven, and earth's tale is told.<a name=164:47></a> But it will be said, Yes, but the death of Christ has laid a new ground of responsibility.<a name=164:48></a> So it has, but by placing man on the ground that man is already lost, and that when we were yet without strength, Christ died for the ungodly.<a name=164:49></a> There is none to will, none to understand, none to answer.<a name=164:50></a> We cannot give divine life to ourselves, nor beget ourselves to God.<a name=164:51></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am not questioning the door being freely open and the blood on the mercy-seat, but this is the final proof that man will not come, when he can as regards God, and God has proved that No motives suffice to induce him: he must be born again wholly afresh.<a name=164:52></a> The history of scripture is of God's using all means and motives, the result being, the rejection of His Son and judgment.<a name=164:53></a> The case of Adam was somewhat different, because lust and selfwill were not yet there: man was not captive to a law of sin in his members; sin was not there, nor was deliverance required; he was with God in innocence.<a name=164:54></a> Clearly God put no restraint on him to leave Him and disobey: his obedience was tested; it was not a question of coming to God when already evil: the prohibition was a pure test of obedience, and the act innocent if it had not been forbidden.<a name=164:55></a> There was as yet no conscience in the sense of knowing the difference of good and evil for oneself; he had only to stay where he was and not disobey.<a name=164:56></a> There was nothing in him, nor, I need not say, in God, to hinder him; in this he was free: his fall proved that not the creature was bad, but if left to himself could not stand firm.<a name=164:57></a> But in this state, so far from choice, and freedom of choice being what he had to do to go right, the moment there was choice and will there was sin.<a name=164:58></a> Obedience simply was my place; if a question arose whether he should obey, sin was there.<a name=164:59></a> Choice is not obedience.<a name=164:60></a> The moment he felt free to choose, he had left the place of simple obedience.<a name=164:61></a> Think of a child who takes the ground of being free to choose whether he shall obey, even if he chooses right, I deny that morality depends on freedom of choice.<a name=164:62></a> Man was created in a given relationship with God; morality consisted in walking in that relationship.<a name=164:63></a> But that relationship was obedience.<a name=164:64></a> There he could have continued simple and happy, and not set himself free from God.<a name=164:65></a> This is what Christ did, He came to do God's will, took the form of a servant.<a name=164:66></a> Satan in the temptation in the wilderness sought to get Him to leave this to be free and do His will, only in eating when He was hungry.<a name=164:67></a> What harm was there in that?<a name=164:68></a> It was freedom and His own will: and His answer is, that man shall <i>live by</i> every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.<a name=164:69></a> There was no movement in His heart or will but from or by the will of God; and that is perfection.<a name=164:70></a> Not a rule checking self-will, which we, alas, often need, but God's will the motive of our action -- of the action of our will.<a name=164:71></a> That is what is called in scripture the obedience of Christ to which we are sanctified.<a name=164:72></a> Man has in one sense made himself free, but it is free from God, and thus is in moral apostasy and the slave of sin.<a name=164:73></a> From this Christ wholly delivers, and sanctifies us to obedience, having borne the penalty of the fruits of our free will.<a name=164:74></a> How came I to have to choose?<a name=164:75></a> If I have, I have no good yet, and what is to make me choose it?<a name=164:76></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		They confound too, Conscience as to good and evil, with will.<a name=164:77></a> Man acquired this by the fall, and it is thus exercised in a state of alienation from God in the unconverted; and will is a distinct thing.<a name=164:78></a> In the flesh it is enmity against God, lust and lawlessness, and, if the law comes, transgression.<a name=164:79></a> If even I have the Spirit of God, it lusts against it.<a name=164:80></a> It is expressed by the heathen in saying, I see better things and approve them, I follow the worse.<a name=164:81></a> There is conscience and lust governing will.<a name=164:82></a> If all this be so, man was perfectly at liberty as to what he might do as put to the test, but the exercise of will or choosing was just sin obedience being his place with God.<a name=164:83></a> He was created in good, and had it not to choose; now he loves sin and his own will, and has to be delivered from it.<a name=164:84></a>

		[F J Rowan] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- The principle that responsibility depends on the power of the responsible person is false, save so far as the alleged responsible person is in his nature such as to negative the claim.<a name=168:1></a> A stone cannot be responsible nor even a beast, for moral conduct, because they are not in the relationship to which responsibility can attach.<a name=168:2></a> But obligation flows from relationship, and where the relationship exists which constitutes it, the obligation subsists: the power to fulfil it has nothing to do with it.<a name=168:3></a> The obligation gives a claim to the person to whom the obliged is responsible.<a name=168:4></a> I had put the case: A man owes me a thousand pounds; you are a spendthrift, and have not a penny you have not power to pay really -- therefore I have no claim nor you responsibility.<a name=168:5></a> That will not do.<a name=168:6></a> Romans cut off their thumbs, and could not hold a spear, to avoid military service: were they held irresponsible?<a name=168:7></a>

		This side of being born again even Romanists, and also Wesleyans, and most evangelicals admit and confine themselves to; that is, an action of the Holy Ghost by the word, by which man is morally purified.<a name=169:11></a> Nay, Wesleyans would say -- lose it, regain it; and even those who do not go so far, still hold it as only a purifying of what is.<a name=169:12></a> The Wesleyans say, man had body, soul and spirit before the fall; and after the fall, body, soul and spirit corrupted, and then being born again, the corruption is removed; and hence a man may be quite perfect as man, if the corruption be wholly removed.<a name=169:13></a> Now I believe (not touching on perfection now) that this is, to say the least, a most defective view of the matter.<a name=169:14></a> I believe the Lord is a life-giving Spirit; and, operating by the Holy Ghost, "that which is born of the Spirit is spirit" -- not the Spirit, who is God; but one is by His divine power quickened, just as that which is born of the flesh is flesh.<a name=169:15></a> I receive spiritually life from Christ, as I receive naturally life from Adam.<a name=169:16></a> In this sense Christ is my life.<a name=169:17></a> He is eternal life (1 John 1), and "he that hath the Son of God hath life.<a name=169:18></a>" It is not I, as of the flesh, but Christ lives in me.<a name=169:19></a> Hence, viewed abstractedly, as thus born of God -- for so John views things -- it is said, "he cannot sin, because he is born of God.<a name=169:20></a>" And this life we have in the power of Christ's resurrection; and it is acted in by the Holy Ghost given to us because of Christ's blood.<a name=169:21></a> So after His resurrection, as God breathed into Adam, Christ breathed into His disciples.<a name=169:22></a> Through this, it is said, "the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.<a name=169:23></a>" A great accessory truth that comes in connected with this is, that Christ having died, I am counted of God (Colossians 3) dead as to the flesh, and to count myself so (Romans 6), and to realise it (2 Corinthians 4), so that only the life of Christ should be manifested.<a name=169:24></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This is the point which my soul clings to on this subject, the real communication in receiving Christ by the power of the Holy Ghost, so as to have what I had not before -- Christ become spiritually my life through the Holy Ghost acting in it in power; created again in Christ Jesus, though the flesh still be there.<a name=169:25></a> But I am not in it, but in Christ, and am bound and privileged to hold it dead.<a name=169:26></a> Of course, this does practically cleanse by and according to the word.<a name=169:27></a> I may not be able to explain it physiologically, but it is to me plain in scripture, and in it the saint will live eternally with God.<a name=169:28></a> "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit" -- partakes of the nature of that of which it is born.<a name=169:29></a> It is holy, loves, and, as in Christ as a man, obeys.<a name=169:30></a> In a word, it is the reproduction, as to its nature, of Christ's life.<a name=169:31></a> "If Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; the Spirit is life because of righteousness.<a name=169:32></a>" It is new a thing as a graft in a wild tree.<a name=169:33></a>

		As regards using Old Testament words as types, I quite agree that our imagination is to be held in check; nor can we ever insist on such as a doctrine.<a name=169:34></a> But there is a passage which may assist your mind on this point (1 Corinthians 10: 11), where the word "ensamples" is "types" or "figures," which gives the principle.<a name=169:35></a> Then we must only look to the Holy Ghost and divine guidance to use them soberly and aright.<a name=169:36></a>.<a name=169:37></a>

		The shade of different meaning in koinwnov" and mevtoco" is I believe, just; but it is a question of adequate observation of its New Testament use in Greek, and any adequate proof would make me abandon it.<a name=169:38></a> At present, though only a shade of meaning, I believe it just.<a name=169:39></a> Luke verse does not to my mind destroy this connection; koinwnoiv is really "partners" for me there, mevtocoi the fact of taking part: but I have no anxiety to insist on this; as I have said, adequate proof would make me give it up at once.<a name=169:40></a>

		Fuvsi" is moral in 2 Peter, from the force of what is said in the passage.<a name=169:41></a> In divine things this is everything, as holiness love, etc.<a name=169:42></a>; but the point I should insist on is, that there is <i>more</i> than mere moral effect, though there be that -- that Christ is for us a life-giving Spirit; as born of the flesh involves a like nature.<a name=169:43></a>

		I do not know whether I have met the question as you wish; I write rapidly, having left Paris this morning, and found a mass of things on my table; but I think, if you take the passages, the life-giving and Christ being our life will be very plain, and that is what to my mind is important, though we never know what it really means till we know it as deliverance in power, the flesh being held as dead according to Romans 8: 2, 3 -- having passed out of chapter vii.<a name=169:44></a> according to the doctrine of chapter 6 and the beginning of chapter 7.<a name=169:45></a> I shall be glad, if of any value to you, to make myself clearer if I can.<a name=169:46></a> "Nature" I see I take just as you do.<a name=169:47></a> Only God cannot communicate Godhead to us as supreme being, but the moral elements of what He is He can in giving life.<a name=169:48></a>

		[G Biava] [From the Italian.<a name=172:1></a>] DEAR BROTHER, -- With respect to the passage Genesis 3: 15, the seed of the serpent is, I believe, the wicked, but manifested as under his influence; "Ye are of your father the devil.<a name=172:2></a>" I do not think that all who are born of man are called the seed of the serpent -- a baby for instance although the same nature is manifested if he lives long in this world.<a name=172:3></a> Christ is in a special way the seed of the woman, but all who are born of God are so.<a name=172:4></a> But all this history is fulfilled on earth; it is not a question of heaven, or of the judgement of the great white throne.<a name=172:5></a> The passages which you have quoted apply to the seed of the serpent.<a name=172:6></a> But if He had said, Thou shalt bruise the heads of thine enemies, this would indeed be a promise made to you.<a name=172:7></a> The importance of this distinction is that no promise is made to the first man; there is an object for faith where faith was found, but there exists no promise for the first Adam.<a name=172:8></a> The second Adam is heir of all the promises.<a name=172:9></a> In Christ we share in these promises.<a name=172:10></a> When the second Adam shall bruise the serpent's head, He will also judge the world of which the serpent is the prince.<a name=172:11></a> On the cross He did morally all that is needed in order to bruise his head, but there His own heel was wounded.<a name=172:12></a>

		In Galatians 3: 16 the apostle is speaking of Genesis 12 and 22, only it is of one special seed.<a name=172:13></a> The promise was made to Abraham alone, and confirmed to his seed in chapter 22.<a name=172:14></a> The promises of a very numerous seed are distinct; also Abraham is not joined to his seed in this promise.<a name=172:15></a> It should be read, "To Abraham were the promises made, and to his seed.<a name=172:16></a>" In chapter 15.<a name=172:17></a> we find the promises to his seed according to the flesh, added to the promises of the one seed.<a name=172:18></a> The reasoning in Galatians is that Christ alone is the seed meant in chapter 22.<a name=172:19></a> when the nations of the world are spoken of; and, if we are in Christ, we are then the seed of Abraham.<a name=172:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to body, soul and spirit: soul and spirit are often used for the same thing, the soul in contrast to the body, the one expression or the other.<a name=172:21></a> But when both words are used, then the spirit is the higher part, soul being used for that which is joined to the body, and causes this to live; spirit, for the part in which man is in relation with God, inasmuch as God had breathed into his nostrils the breath of life.<a name=172:22></a> If there was nothing but soul, he would be no better than the beasts; but inasmuch as God, when the body was already formed, breathed into his nostrils in order that he should become alive, he is in relation with God Himself, and is eternally miserable if he is separated from God.<a name=172:23></a> Soul is often used for life, and for the soul properly so-called, in the same sentence, because in the Greek language there is only one word for the two, yuchv .<a name=172:24></a> If a man shall lose his yuchv for the love of Jesus, he shall gain it.<a name=172:25></a> (Matthew 16: 25, 26).<a name=172:26></a> The first time it is only life; the second it is much more.<a name=172:27></a> Also, "He that will save his yuchv shall lose it," where the thing is still clearer.<a name=172:28></a>

		I do not think that (Revelation 12.<a name=172:29></a> 16) "swallowed up" ought to be taken literally, but that the providence of God will cause that the efforts of the dragon to destroy the woman (the Jewish remnant) should fail, through the action of the nations of the earth; in a manner somewhat miraculous, but providential.<a name=172:30></a> Those sent by the dragon and employed by him to destroy the woman are lost, as it were, in the midst of the population of the earth, and they do nothing .<a name=172:31></a>.<a name=172:32></a>.<a name=172:33></a>

		As regard dikaivwsi" ( Romans 4: 25) -- diav is translated "for" as giving the sense best in English, The point is, not there, but in dikaivwsi".<a name=174:4></a> Diav with an accusative is just "on account of"; but dikaivwsi" is not the thing done but the doing of it; and it is this, on which it turns.<a name=174:5></a> If it had been "on account of our having been justified," it would have been dia; to; dikaiwqh'nai hJma'".<a name=174:6></a> And this is not the case till faith comes in; hence (chapter 5: 1) dikaiwqevute" ejk pivstew".<a name=174:7></a> The Greek rule is that words derived from the perfect passive are the thing done, doing it, and the doer -- krivma the judgment, krivsi" the judging, kritev" the judge -- though all three are not always there.<a name=174:8></a> We have dikaivwma, dikaivwsi"; I am not aware of dikaivwth".<a name=174:9></a>

		As to Job 19: 25 I believe in Job's mind it was a confident trust that God would then deliver him.<a name=174:10></a> But I cannot help thinking that, the Spirit of God so ordered it as to imply a brighter and better hope, as the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob did, in the Lord's hands, beyond the mind of the Jews.<a name=174:11></a> You may see by the italics that the passage is very obscure.<a name=174:12></a> I find I have translated in German as the Italian Diodati does -- And I know my Redeemer lives, and he will stand at the end upon the earth and if after my skin this shall be destroyed (Italian, 'consumed'), yet I shall out of (or 'with') my flesh look upon God," etc.<a name=174:13></a> The difference is not very material, "worms" and "body" being both in italics.<a name=174:14></a> In Hebrew it is simply "they have destroyed.<a name=174:15></a>" Verse 24 desires that his confidence in God was engraven on a rock, and the result would prove that it was right.<a name=174:16></a> The Redeemer is the common word for next of kin, on whom the right of redemption and avenging injuries devolved.<a name=174:17></a> God would be his goel (Hebrew).<a name=174:18></a> People have thought Job's faith could not have reached this: perhaps not, habitually.<a name=174:19></a> But here his soul rises up to God, and he puts life in God in contrast with the present consumption of skin and flesh, and that the power of deliverance (and will) from its perishing condition was there.<a name=174:20></a> He lives, he stands up above all that is dust, and while possibly looking to deliverance I doubt not the Spirit looks to a better resurrection.<a name=174:21></a>

		As to "likeness,"<a href="#174:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a> the reference is to baptism; but oJmoiwvmati is not merely likeness as comparison.<a name=174:22></a> Christ "was made in the likeness of men," according to this pattern.<a name=174:23></a> It is not the thing itself, but in the case of Christ's humanity, clearly not the denial of it.<a name=174:24></a> If I have taken my place with Christ, I have taken it with Him dead, and consequently if it be His death it involves according to the same pattern resurrection.<a name=174:25></a> He takes the reality of the thing, but takes it as expressed and patterned in baptism.<a name=174:26></a> In Romans we are not risen with Him in baptism.<a name=174:27></a>

		... Dr.<a name=175:1></a> -- 's remarks on metevcw and koinwnov" -- where there is a shade of difference in two words -- are merely shewing he does not seize it, which is no very great matter.<a name=175:2></a> Either may be used in many cases, but they are not the same.<a name=175:3></a> 'Common,' and 'partake,' represent them, I may say, perfectly.<a name=175:4></a> 'It is common to us both,' I partake of what you have,' are not the same, though often they may be used indifferently.<a name=175:5></a> But with excessive vagueness and obscurity he seems to deny the real communication of divine life.<a name=175:6></a> "Christ is my life": "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.<a name=175:7></a>" Even as to the first man he is all wrong.<a name=175:8></a> God "breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul.<a name=175:9></a>" It is the very ground of our relationship and responsibility, and everlasting misery if not saved.<a name=175:10></a> The body was formed of dust, and man became a living soul by God's breathing into his nostrils, not by a mere <i>fiat</i> of creation as in the case of the beasts.<a name=175:11></a> Was man 'a mule' by it?<a name=175:12></a> This is too bad.<a name=175:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But any denial of divine life communicated in Christ is for christian people equally mischievous.<a name=175:14></a> "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit," as "that which is born of the flesh is flesh.<a name=175:15></a>" There is no combining of natures or lives, though they are in the same person, as soul and body are.<a name=175:16></a> A mule is a mixture of natures, whereas the intelligent Christian holds his flesh as always antagonist to the Spirit, "contrary the one to the other.<a name=175:17></a>" One comes from sinful Adam, lawless naturally, law-breaker when under it, hater of God present in love, resister of the Spirit when He dwells in us, puffing up if possible if a man goes to the third heaven -- which death only cures, or rather ends, first for faith, then in fact.<a name=175:18></a> The Second Adam is a quickening Spirit, but the flesh is not quickened morally at all, but only in being changed or resurrection.<a name=175:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Of course, we partake of the divine nature in a different manner from God.<a name=175:20></a> And this is the import of the difference of koinwnoiv and metocoi.<a name=175:21></a> One is what we have together as a right, or fact, common to both; the other we get a part in -- though we may become koinwnoiv by it -- or, in virtue of being koinwnoiv, metevcein in anything, share in it.<a name=175:22></a> If I am a partaker with you it is common to us, both the position and metevcw in the profits: if I having been a stranger come to have a share, metevcein, I, become koinwnov".<a name=175:23></a> And this is sometimes important, as when the apostle declares that if people were metocoi they become koinwnov" -- identified with the altar or an idol.<a name=175:24></a> (1 Corinthians 10: 18-21.<a name=175:25></a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The important point is to see that divine life is really communicated, that I receive what I had not before.<a name=175:26></a> I should not exactly quote 2 Peter for it, because he is speaking of promises by which we get it, and nature is, as you say, more character thus used than life; but it involves the other, and the two cannot be separated.<a name=175:27></a> We are "born of water and of the Spirit.<a name=175:28></a>" We are cleansed by the word, but that is inseparably connected with being born of the Spirit.<a name=175:29></a> You could not say, 'That which is born of water is water.<a name=175:30></a>' There is a washing of water by the word.<a name=175:31></a> But "that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.<a name=175:32></a>" .<a name=175:33></a>.<a name=175:34></a>.<a name=175:35></a>

		No doubt God was not changed when the Word became flesh, but there was real union and He ejkevnwse seautovn; and Christ could speak of being abandoned of God, and could pray to God.<a name=175:42></a> God was manifest withal in the flesh.<a name=175:43></a> This is different from us of course, but to deny that divine life is communicated is a most fatal error.<a name=175:44></a> 2 Peter 1: 4 is more morally; but as God breathed into man's nostrils, so "the Spirit is life because of righteousness," and "the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free.<a name=175:45></a>" Christ is my life: we are begotten of God, born of God.<a name=175:46></a> It is not a mere change produced, though there be such change, but the communication of life, and because He lives we shall live also.<a name=175:47></a> He is eternal life, and "God has given to us eternal life, and that life is in his Son": "He that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.<a name=175:48></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		Nature is used more as characteristic of a being: the nature of a horse, of a man, and so even of God, as we say.<a name=175:49></a> It is his nature, meaning inbred character, only it is inherent in the being as such, not acquired; hence the proverb, "use is second nature.<a name=175:50></a>" No nature as such is changeable -- hence the lines:

	<div class="paragraph">
		I only refer to these as shewing the force of the words.<a name=175:52></a> God is in a far higher sense unchangeable.<a name=175:53></a> But I may practically have a new nature, because I can, through grace, receive a new life, and so have the nature of that life.<a name=175:54></a>

		You could not say in 2 Peter 1: 4 mevtocoi.<a name=175:55></a> It would be becoming partakers in sense, whereas they have been placed in the position of koinwnoiv, and mevtocoi would really give ground for what -- charges us with, that we were to share the divine nature as such.<a name=175:56></a> We are koinwnoiv, have in common with God what morally belongs to His nature, as holiness, love, etc.<a name=175:57></a>, we are light in the Lord.<a name=175:58></a> It is as mevtocoi that we are <i>de facto</i> koinwnoiv.<a name=175:59></a>

Is it that we 'partake of the divine nature in a different manner from God,' and so 'enjoy the benefit of all the excellency of the divine nature without becoming uncreated or unchangeable,' or sharing any of the attributes which God claims as essential to Himself? <p>4. Is there nothing between that position and the thought which has been advanced, that because 'the divine nature is sui generis, infinite, eternal, and unchangeable, and therefore essentially different from the nature of all created beings, it must in some way be modified by a union with humanity, as the nature of a horse is modified in the mule, by union with that of the ass?' <p>7. Does 2 Peter 1: 4 mean that we are made partakers of the divine nature as such? Or does 'nature' here mean rather the moral characteristics which, when made His children, we share in common with God?"

		I do not think the two words are used indiscriminately; ina would not be used for 'he heard that he was'; for 'a custom that he should,' we have seen it is.<a name=179:35></a> The day or the state of things was a reason, a motive, that something should be.<a name=179:36></a> It is so that it should, not the fact that it was.<a name=179:37></a> You can examine the passages, but in the practical use of the word in these cases you cannot make it telic.<a name=179:38></a> Such changes in the degeneration of a language are common, and the Holy Ghost used the vessel as it was, though to His own purposes, and this is every way a great mercy.<a name=179:39></a>

		BELOVED BROTHER, -- I hear that your -- is in a very precarious state, and I seize a moment to write to you, to express what I trust you are assured of, dear brother, my unfeigned sympathy with you, and I would add, dear Mrs.<a name=183:1></a> -- , though I have not seen her.<a name=183:2></a> If the soul walks with God, it is not hard, but it is submissive; and there is no softer spirit, nor one which is more susceptible of every feeling than submission; but then it takes the will out of the affections without destroying them, and that is very precious.<a name=183:3></a> So was it with Christ.<a name=183:4></a> He felt everything; His tenderness was perfect, and yet how perfect His submissiveness.<a name=183:5></a> How God exercises the heart by these things!<a name=183:6></a> It is not simply that the heart is tried by the sorrow itself (in which we can reckon on the most tender sympathy of Christ), but when the heart is thus brought into the presence of a God who is thus dealing with us, all our ways, all the interior of our heart, all His ways with and His appeals to us often in such cases rise up within.<a name=183:7></a> If the will is unbroken, and no clearness as to grace be known, a perplexed and anxious judgment ensues; if not this, often a humble and lowly judgment of self; for the knowledge of grace makes us lowly when it is real.<a name=183:8></a>

		It is astonishing how much often remains as a sediment at the bottom of the heart in a man, gracious in the main of his life, which the rod of God stirs up when He thrusts it in -- often underlying all the contents of the heart, yet always to be carried off by the living stream of the waters of His grace -- not merely faults, but a mass of unjudged materials of every-day life, a living under the influence of what is seen, or unjudged affections of every kind.<a name=183:9></a> All that is not up to the measure of our spiritual height is then judged in its true character, as connected with flesh before God.<a name=183:10></a>

		Besides, it is only in the part which has to be broken and corrected that we suffer: a touched affection, when Christ is with us in the grief, is of infinite sweetness, though the sweetness of sorrow.<a name=184:14></a> It is only when the will mixes itself up with the sorrow that there is any bitterness in it, or a pain in which Christ is not.<a name=184:15></a> But then this is all useful and what we need.<a name=184:16></a> The Lord takes your dear babe to heaven (certainly he has no loss); what is the rest of God's dealings in it with us -- with one's heart?<a name=184:17></a> He who has made a mother's feelings knows what they are -- knows what He has wounded, and knows why -- has a purpose of love in it.<a name=184:18></a> There is a mass of things in the sincerest of us, of which we are not aware, which are not brought into subjection to God, which work and shew themselves unsuspected.<a name=184:19></a> God breaks in upon us: how many things He shews -- how many cords He cuts at one blow!<a name=184:20></a> A whole system of affections is touched: we feel that death has its place and part in them.<a name=184:21></a> I never saw a family the same thing after the first death that it was before.<a name=184:22></a> There was a breach in the circle.<a name=184:23></a> What belonged to the whole body of affections and life of this world was touched, was found to be -- mortal: it was struck in its very nature.<a name=184:24></a> The course of life went on; the wave had closed over that which had been cast into it; but death, and the affections which belong to this world, had been found to meet.<a name=184:25></a> But all this is well; for death is come in.<a name=184:26></a> Besides, we live in these things; our will lives in them; and when the will is broken, so far as it is so, it is broken for everything.<a name=184:27></a> We learn more to lean on what never breaks -- not to lose our affections, but to have them more in connection with Christ, less with this will of our own nature; for nature must now die as well as sin.<a name=184:28></a> But then Christ never makes a breach, except to come in and connect the soul and heart more with Himself; and it is worth all the sorrow that ever was, and more, to learn the least atom more of His love and of Himself; and there is nothing like that, like Him; and it lasts.<a name=184:29></a>

		Dearest C McAdam, -- As to the question you put: governmental wrath [on Christ] is all totally wrong.<a name=187:1></a> When I speak of governmental wrath, it is just in contrast with expiation; and any governmental wrath on the cross was on Israel, not on Christ at all, only He entered into it I believe.<a name=187:2></a> That is what they made so much fuss about.<a name=187:3></a> His sympathy will be with them at the end?<a name=187:4></a> but He suffered in going through it all in heart and spirit, that He might sympathise with them, as He suffered being tried to be able to sympathise with us.<a name=187:5></a> This is what H.<a name=187:6></a> denied expressly -- the actual suffering -- or I should have with drawn the tract for his sake and D.<a name=187:7></a>'s, if no more.<a name=187:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But no governmental wrath was on Him; whereas when He was made sin it was on Him though for us -- then the cup He had to drink that we might never drink it -- He, and He alone (as to us), drank the cup.<a name=187:9></a> In the other, He felt the sorrow for His people of their losing all according to the flesh, suffered from Gentiles, suffered from apostate Jews, as they will, and was cut off as Messiah, taking nothing.<a name=187:10></a> But the governmental wrath was on them, not on Him, though He entered into it, and had the sorrow and suffering of it on His heart and in His circumstances.<a name=187:11></a> But the cross is another thing as expiation.<a name=187:12></a> There it was Himself drank the cup instead of others.<a name=187:13></a> It was the hatred of God's nature to sin, and His judicial action as to it on Him, to save us; though the scripture, I suppose to avoid the idea of personal displeasure, does not use the word "wrath" as to it.<a name=187:14></a> Yet it was the cup of God's wrath against sin.<a name=187:15></a> But the absence of the word would suffice to set aside the idea of governmental wrath, which I judge all wrong.<a name=187:16></a> I have no difficulty as to it myself.<a name=187:17></a> I do not believe one drop of consolation was in Christ's heart when He made propitiation for sin, or it would have rendered the suffering and sacrifice for sin imperfect: He drank the cup -- solemn thought -- of bitterness without alloy, or any relief, because He was made sin, and had to be that before God as God in holiness for us, and it was just the perfectness of this in obedience and love to His Father, its absoluteness for God's glory, that made God and the Father find perfect complacency in it and in Him.<a name=187:18></a> If there had been some relief, some assuagement of the suffering, it would not have been sin before God; but because there was none, and He perfect in glorifying God in it, therefore God's complacency was perfect in it, and the Father's in Him as doing it.<a name=187:19></a> Hence, too, He says, "My Father," but on the cross, "My God, my God," when accomplishing the work (still "my" because He was perfect), and "my Father" and "my God" after (and ours then) and that for us too, entering into the full effect in righteousness and love, ever personally His -- but now through redemption for us too.<a name=187:20></a> The divinity did not screen the manhood from the taste of the terrible cup, but enabled Him to drink it.<a name=187:21></a> He offered Himself through the eternal Spirit to God, as He cast out devils by the Spirit of God.<a name=187:22></a> And though God of course could not die -- no more even could a human soul -- yet there was no separation of the natures.<a name=187:23></a> Let nothing weaken our sense of the full propitiation for sin.<a name=187:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Of course, if I think of the Son as a divine Person, He could not die -- no more, I repeat, could a human soul in fact.<a name=187:25></a> But if a man not having a soul was there, what is his death?<a name=187:26></a> Nonentity.<a name=187:27></a> If Christ was only as a man there, it was no more than another man there, only sinless -- that is, it was nothing.<a name=187:28></a> The Son as a divine Person of course could not die, looked at apart; but He who was Son died and gave Himself, not as apart, but in all the infinite value of His Person and in His divine love to us.<a name=187:29></a> I do not say Mary was, the mother of God, if I may compare them, but she was the mother of Him personally who was God, and if He was not, His birth was nothing.<a name=187:30></a> A person may object to saying the Son died, because he is looking at Him apart as a divine Person; but if it be denied that He being Son died, I have lost the value of His death, which is infinite, both in love and value.<a name=187:31></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Governmental wrath is all wrong.<a name=187:32></a> I admit perfect complacency, but complacency in His perfectly drinking the cup (forsaken of God as to the feeling of His soul) and in Him that did it; but solace by it, there is not a trace of in scripture; it would destroy its perfectness.<a name=187:33></a>

		[W G Heney] [MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I write to reply to your question at the close of your letter, though most thankful to get your account of the work.<a name=191:1></a> The only difficulty with me is the question, whether the law of Canada does not require a formal divorce in these cases.<a name=191:2></a> If it does not, I should just leave the matter where it is.<a name=191:3></a> In the first place, what was done originally was before her conversion; but when the unbeliever leaves, the other party is free according to 1 Corinthians 7, and if a divorce be not required, she is free according to the law of man (if it be, there is irregularity which perhaps may be rectified).<a name=191:4></a> As the man had left her, she practically entered the church of God as a lone woman, and I do not occupy myself with what was before, unless sin to be repented of.<a name=191:5></a> When I meet her now, I meet her as one whom the law considers free; and the previous desertion left her free when deliberately done, if I take Christian ground.<a name=191:6></a> I may regret her doing it, and do as to the manner of it.<a name=191:7></a> But as unconverted, I recognise nothing before unless sin: say a heathen, he may as such have had and left twenty wives, I ignore it all when he is converted.<a name=191:8></a> Being abandoned she did not stand as a married woman, when she married, unless a formal divorce was required.<a name=191:9></a> In England the courts hold a woman free after seven years, the husband not being heard of, but there is no law to say so.<a name=191:10></a> I know not how it is in Canada.<a name=191:11></a> I question it a little unless it be known to be so.<a name=191:12></a> But I do not think a deserted woman would be held to perpetual celibacy where the law recognised her as free.<a name=191:13></a> Many questions would arise as to her conduct.<a name=191:14></a> Did she tell her present husband before she was married?<a name=191:15></a> What oath or equivalent assertion was made to get married?<a name=191:16></a> I suppose there is some as in civil marriage, and publishing banns.<a name=191:17></a> Did she say there was no impediment when, if a formal divorce was required, there was?<a name=191:18></a> A person in London was kept out on this ground; he had sworn or solemnly declared there was no obstacle as they went, and it was his wife's sister, not allowed in England.<a name=191:19></a> But if a formal divorce is not required by law, but the woman held free <i>ipso facto</i> after seven years, I should say she stood a free woman, though I may regret her path, and inquire, as I have said, as to the circumstances.<a name=191:20></a> If taken on profession as a Christian, she was free according to 1 Corinthians; if looked at as merely of the world, she had no husband.<a name=191:21></a> It was all before conversion.<a name=191:22></a> And legally (if divorce not required) she was free when she married, only I should look to where her conscience was in doing it.<a name=191:23></a> The passage in Romans [7: 2, 3] does not exactly apply.<a name=191:24></a> The word "married" is, not in the Greek at all.<a name=191:25></a> The woman is supposed to be in full connection with and under the authority of the husband, and then "is to another man," that is faithless to the existing bond.<a name=191:26></a> Here the question is whether the existing bond was not dissolved, and an actual marriage a lawful one.<a name=191:27></a> I should fear if her conscience had been clear she would have spoken to brethren.<a name=191:28></a> But that is another question.<a name=191:29></a>

		[T Roberts] DEAREST BROTHER, -- The only thing I have to notice in your letter save to agree is, where you say we are sealed<a href="#193:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> 'on our believing in Christ, as the One who delivered us from the old man (the old Adam standing), .<a name=193:39></a>.<a name=193:40></a>.<a name=193:41></a> from sin within, and from the world; and this He does by having died for us when He put away our sins and our having died with Him,' etc.<a name=193:42></a> Now I judge from scripture that the sealing comes, or may come, consequent on our believing in Christ's death for the remission of sins, without including our having died with Him for deliverance.<a name=193:43></a> This too may be the case: it was mine.<a name=193:44></a> But sealing comes on forgiveness; for our being looked at then as clean, the Holy Ghost can come and dwell in us.<a name=193:45></a> Thus Peter, "Repent and be baptised every one of you for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.<a name=193:46></a>" So when he preached to Cornelius, who was listening with faith, the moment he comes to "shall receive remission of sins" -- as he spake these words the Holy Ghost came upon them: so Romans 5 -- before the discussion of our not being in flesh is commenced.<a name=193:47></a> If we go through Romans 7 before Romans 3, as was my own case, then pardon and deliverance go together; but in these revival preaching days, many receive the remission of their sins before they have any self-knowledge, and have, though in a modified form (not substance), to go through Romans 7 afterwards.<a name=193:48></a> But this is always really law; namely, what is expected from us.<a name=193:49></a> But there is no deliverance without self-knowledge, and the work substantially of Romans 7.<a name=193:50></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Forgiveness needs no such process.<a name=193:51></a> Convinced of <i>guilt</i>, no doubt we must be; but this supposes no knowledge of self -- that is state, not acts which constitute guilt.<a name=193:52></a> There is no forgiveness of a nature; but where it was condemned, death came in (the cross), and so I am delivered.<a name=193:53></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards Romans 6: 11, and 2 Corinthians 4: 10;<a href="#193:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a> one is faith as to the truth and position, the other realising it in practice: Colossians 3 gives God's judgment, "Ye are dead"; Romans 6: 11, man's faith as to having died with Christ as to the old man on the cross -- I reckon myself dead; 2 Corinthians 4: 10 realises it in practice.<a name=193:54></a> I always bear about in my body the dying, never let the flesh from under the power of Christ's death and cross, treating it de facto as a crucified thing that has no title to stir, though it be really there.<a name=193:55></a> Then God passes through circumstances which test how far it is realised; if we are faithful to verse 10, in the form of suffering for Christ, as was Paul's case; if not, to make practically good what is wanting.<a name=193:56></a> And this is the gracious history of many sorrows: He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous.<a name=193:57></a>" The Lord be with you.<a name=193:58></a> If all be not clear, you can write to me.<a name=193:59></a>

		[To the same, later.<a name=195:1></a>] T Roberts, I do not attach especial importance to the immediate moment of the sealing;<a href="#195:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> merely if scripture ascertain it, it is always gain to know it, and I think it does this.<a name=195:2></a> I do not think the passages, already presented to me by others, offer any difficulty.<a name=195:3></a> Clearly it is because we are sons, that the Spirit is given us to cry Abba, Father, and we are sons by faith of Jesus Christ.<a name=195:4></a> But I do not think this passage says anything as to the moment at which, as its occasion, we receive it, but merely states the fact; nor does Ephesians 1.<a name=195:5></a> There it is on believing in the most general way in the direct statement, and when we come to "the gospel of your salvation," it rather confirms it; for what was brought to them was not the subsequent glories in which they were edified, but the fact of salvation, as previously in the same chapter -- "redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins"; as "the redemption of the purchased possession" comes afterwards.<a name=195:6></a> The presenting of Christ's Person as the great object of faith is all important.<a name=195:7></a> It is just what is wanting in modern gospel preaching

		Flesh<a href="#195:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a> is used in the New Testament for our sinful nature, as it works habitually through its lusts.<a name=195:8></a> So "flesh," "sin in the flesh," and "sinful flesh," are substantially the same, though it may be in different aspects and application; "the mind of the flesh" is also used, its bent, and purpose or object.<a name=195:9></a> Sin has a much wider sense -- "who taketh away the sin of the world," for instance, "to put away sin.<a name=195:10></a>" But if we look at it in the sense of a nature and principle, it is the same as flesh.<a name=195:11></a> It is sin that dwelleth in me.<a name=195:12></a> "I know that in me, that is in my flesh, dwells no good thing.<a name=195:13></a>" Christ "was made sin": here evidently it is not sin in us.<a name=195:14></a> Sinfulness is the state of the flesh and fleshly mind.<a name=195:15></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#195:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>'My difficulty arose from Ephesians 1, where the sealing follows the reference by the apostle to the gospel of their salvation. If he there makes the sealing consequent upon the reception of the gospel of their salvation, it is clear that it is upon the reception of more than the knowledge of forgiveness of sins, as salvation would, I suppose, include in result our complete deliverance ... . The "whom" would refer to Christ; but the gospel of your salvation being referred to seemed to convey more than merely faith in His Person or in Himself. Now in Galatians 4 the gift of the Spirit to us seems to be in virtue of our sonship, into which position we are brought by faith in Christ personally.'

		[From the French.<a name=197:1></a>] VERY DEAR BROTHER, -- A fall that demands excommunication is not the commencement of evil in a Christian: the soul must have become weak in its communion, not have kept near to God.<a name=197:2></a> It does not depend on sincerity in these cases.<a name=197:3></a> Carried on by the current of work that is before him, he does not place himself sufficiently before God, does not judge himself, is not naked before God, and is occupied with the work rather than with Him; the heart is not fathomed, and he does not know himself, does not know if he is in communion with the Lord or not.<a name=197:4></a> If the heart were placed before Him, he would soon discover that he was not, and would seek His face.<a name=197:5></a> A person makes the discovery of evil, either in its root before God, or in its fruits before Satan, and if the first alternative be neglected, the second takes place sooner or later; and it is agony for the soul to have dishonoured the Lord.<a name=197:6></a> I hope at least that others will fear and will be on their guard.<a name=197:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is one point which in a great measure makes me write.<a name=197:8></a> It seems from your letter that it is the meeting of labouring brothers which has pronounced the excommunication.<a name=197:9></a> Now I do not at all question the rightness of the act; but it is the assembly to which he belonged habitually, or the one where his failure had been committed which ought to have done it.<a name=197:10></a> That the labourers should have refused to labour in the work with him, is well, although the assembly had refused to put him out; but a meeting of labouring brothers is not the assembly, and the practical difference is this, that the conscience of the assembly is not purified.<a name=197:11></a> Paul compelled the assembly at Corinth to put out the incestuous man, in order that it should be truly a new lump, then afterwards he said to them, "Ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter.<a name=197:12></a>" If the assembly does not feel itself in a state to do it, that places the brothers on their own responsibility, and if they call in other experienced brothers to help, it is all right, for the body is one; but it is the assembly that cuts off in order to purify itself, and this is of all importance; it is the essential part of discipline, and it may be that the labourers were not the most suitable people for that.<a name=197:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have seen this tendency a little in France, and it does not place the assemblies before God in the consciousness of their own responsibility, which is most important.<a name=197:14></a> I think the assembly at has, at least tacitly, ratified the sentence pronounced, and that our poor brother has submitted himself to it.<a name=197:15></a> So much the better, it is not to weaken that that I write.<a name=197:16></a> What he has to do is to humble himself deeply before God, and also before the brethren, that his soul may be restored.<a name=197:17></a> It would be the worst sign if he sought to escape the judgment pronounced on account of its form: that would take away from me any hope in his case of a speedy restoration.<a name=197:18></a> I write as a general caution with respect to what appears to me important.<a name=197:19></a> What the brethren have to do now is to seek his restoration, but I mean by that a true restoration of his soul.<a name=197:20></a> I believe him sincere, and that his conscience has not lost its sensibility.<a name=197:21></a> But there is more than that in true repentance -- to be before God as to the subject of what one has done, and the dishonour done to the name of our precious Lord.<a name=197:22></a> Seek to lead back his soul by this way.<a name=197:23></a> He will understand grace better afterwards if he returns thus, and the quicker the better; the heart becomes accustomed to estrangement.<a name=197:24></a>

		<a name=198>[Page 198]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		[From the French.<a name=198:1></a>] -- - I begin by taking for granted what is admitted to be a common basis of action; that is, that every assembly of Christians gathered to the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the unity of His body, from the time it acts as the body, does so on its own responsibility to the Lord: as, for instance, when it performs an act of discipline or when it carries out all other things of that nature, as it also does when it receives in the name of the Lord Jesus those who come among them to take part at His table.<a name=198:2></a> Each assembly, in such a case, acts on its own initiative, and in its sphere in deciding matters purely local, but which have a bearing which extends to the whole church.<a name=198:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The spiritual men, who addict themselves to this work and are occupied with its details, before the case is brought before the assembly so that the consciences of all may be exercised in the case, may doubtless thoroughly explore the details with much profit and godly care.<a name=198:4></a> But if it comes to deciding anything apart from the assembly of the saints, even in the most ordinary things, their action would cease to be the assembly's action and it ought to be disowned.<a name=198:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When such local matters are thus treated by an assembly, acting in its sphere as an assembly, all the other assemblies of the saints are bound, as being in the unity of the body, to recognise what has been done by taking for granted (unless the contrary is shewn) that everything has been carried out uprightly and in the fear of God in the name of the Lord.<a name=198:6></a> Heaven will, I am sure, recognise and ratify that holy action, and the Lord has said that it shall be so.<a name=198:7></a> (Matthew 18: 18.<a name=198:8></a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It has often been said and acknowledged that discipline which consists in putting away from among yourselves (1 Corinthians 5: 13) ought to be the last means to which we should have recourse and only when all patience and all grace have been exhausted and when allowing the evil a longer continuance, would be nothing else but a dishonour to the name of the Lord, and would practically associate the evil with Him, and with the profession of His name.<a name=198:9></a> On the other hand the discipline of putting away is always done with the view of restoring the person who has been subjected to it, and never to get rid of him.<a name=198:10></a> So it is in God's ways with us.<a name=198:11></a> God has always in view the good of the soul, its restoration in fulness of joy and communion, and He never draws back His hand so long as this result remains unattained.<a name=198:12></a> Discipline, as God would have it, carried out in His fear, has the same thing in view, otherwise, it is not of God.<a name=198:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But whilst a local assembly exists actually in a personal responsibility of its own, and while its acts, if they are of God, bind the other assemblies, as in the unity of the one body, this fact does not do away with another which is of the highest importance, and which many seem to forget, namely, that the voices of brethren in other localities have liberty equally with those of the local brethren, to make themselves heard in their midst, when discussing the affairs of a meeting of the saints, although they are not locally members of that meeting.<a name=198:14></a> To deny this would, indeed, be a serious denial of the unity of the body of Christ.<a name=198:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And more than this, the conscience and moral condition of a local assembly may be such as to betray ignorance, or at least an imperfect comprehension of what is due to the glory of Christ and to Himself.<a name=198:16></a> All this renders the understanding so weak that there is no longer any spiritual power for discerning good and evil.<a name=198:17></a> Perhaps in an assembly, also, prejudices, haste, or indeed the bent of mind, and the influence of one or of many may lead the assembly's judgment astray, and cause it to punish unjustly and do a serious wrong to a brother.<a name=198:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When such is the case, it is a real blessing that spiritual and wise men from other meetings should step in and seek to awaken the conscience of the assembly, as also, if they come at the request of the gathering or of those to whom the matter is the chief difficulty at the time.<a name=198:19></a> In such a case their stepping in far from being looked upon as an intrusion ought to be received and acknowledged in the name of the Lord.<a name=198:20></a> To act in any other way would surely be to sanction independency and to deny the unity of the body of Christ.<a name=198:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nevertheless, those who come in and act thus ought not to act without the rest of the assembly, but with the conscience of all.<a name=198:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When an assembly has rejected every remonstrance, and refuses to accept the help and the judgment of other brethren, when patience has been exhausted, an assembly which has been in communion with it is justified in annulling its wrong act and in accepting the person who was put out if they were mistaken as to him.<a name=198:23></a> But when we are driven to this extremity the difficulty has become a question of the refusal of fellowship with the assembly which has acted wrongly, and which has thus of its own accord broken its fellowship with the rest of those who act in the unity of the body.<a name=198:24></a> Such measures can only be taken after much care and patience, in order that the conscience of all may go along with the action as being of God.<a name=198:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I call attention to these subjects because there might be a tendency to set up an independence of action in each local assembly by refusing to admit the intervention of those who being in fellowship might come from other places.<a name=198:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But all action, as I have acknowledged from the outset, primarily belongs to the local assembly.<a name=198:27></a><br>[1872]

		[J Dunlop (This or the next letter)] BELOVED BROTHER, I was very glad to get your letter, and though I have let a long time slip without answering it, it was not want of interest in its contents, nor failure in thinking of you, but I have a train of work which makes some letters, letters of leisure, where it is not necessity of answering, but just, on the contrary, interest in the work and in the labourer.<a name=203:1></a>

		We go on through the toils of service, where as good in Christ it has to make its way, and make itself effectual by divine strength in the midst of evil and alienation from God, and, as to testimony, adapt itself to it.<a name=203:2></a> That was what was so beautiful in Christ.<a name=203:3></a> In heaven all is good.<a name=203:4></a> God is there, and only goodness and holiness, and nothing inconsistent with it.<a name=203:5></a> We cannot be simple, or want simplicity there, for God fills everything, and we and all are what He would have us.<a name=203:6></a> It is an infinite "I am" of good.<a name=203:7></a> But Christ was something else.<a name=203:8></a> He was divine good, and infinite, but good adapting itself, shewing itself infinite in being always itself, and yet adapting itself to all the wants, sorrows, miseries, sins, that were in this poor world.<a name=203:9></a> We get to God, get to the.<a name=203:10></a> Father by it, because He has got to us.<a name=203:11></a> What a wonderful thought it is, to see Godhead emptying itself, thereby to prove itself love, as no angel could have known it coming down as man even unto death, and to be made sin, that I might learn what God is in death, where sin had brought me; and absolute obedience in man, in what disobedience had brought us into; death, the way of life; the extreme of man in weakness where (as to this world) it ended, the place where God is revealed and triumphant, and the power of Satan destroyed.<a name=203:12></a> But the Christian redeemed by this, and according to this, has to be this good, to express, walking in holiness, divine love in this world, by manifesting the life of Christ, and seeking the deliverance of souls.<a name=203:13></a>

		Dearest R T Grant, Assuredly repentance is needed, and there is no solid knowledge of the cross without it.<a name=206:1></a> The question for my mind is not exactly that, but how to preach it.<a name=206:2></a> We must have faith in the word to repent.<a name=206:3></a> What word?<a name=206:4></a> It was, with remission of sins, to be preached in Christ's name.<a name=206:5></a> Christian repentance implies grace, I mean recognising grace in a measure.<a name=206:6></a> Repentance is for me practically judgment of the past in the sense of grace.<a name=206:7></a> People may preach solely love and remission: this is not complete, there is what is defective in it.<a name=206:8></a> But where God works it produces repentance, but often calling for much ulterior deepening, sometimes through sorrow.<a name=206:9></a> But repentance may be preached legally as a preliminary, and then remission.<a name=206:10></a> But in this case grace is seldom fully known, because the base supposes man's action preparing himself for it.<a name=206:11></a> Reaction against this has partly produced the revival preaching, where repentance is thrown into the shade.<a name=206:12></a> When God works He makes both meet.<a name=206:13></a> Repentance has to be preached, because there is God's Cain over man and man's judgment of himself, but preached in Christ's name, which carries grace with it.<a name=206:14></a> It is easy to put the just line on paper.<a name=206:15></a> In preaching, love to souls and living with God -- and <i>God's</i> love to souls, which involves necessarily His holiness -- will alone give preaching its true character.<a name=206:16></a> I am sure, and it is evident, that conscience must be reached, or nothing is done.<a name=206:17></a> But that is power, and God's power.<a name=206:18></a> Law itself may be used lawfully, when there is a reckless conscience, and with blessing; only grace and remission must go with it.<a name=206:19></a> But the cross convicts of sin, where really understood, more deeply than anything.<a name=206:20></a>

		Dear J James, -- I do not understand what people mean by being actually dead, seeing they are living at -- .<a name=207:1></a> But patience clearly is our part.<a name=207:2></a> It is not like a heresy: it is only an absurdity.<a name=207:3></a> If they hold the flesh to be really gone, then indeed it is a mischievous error.<a name=207:4></a> I should not have to reckon were I really dead, and the context makes it clear.<a name=207:5></a> "Reckon" (Romans 6: 11) is the estimate I form according to faith of my condition and standing, the estimate of my faith, not a statement as to the state I am in; and this is equally true as to "alive.<a name=207:6></a>" But the statement here is not that I have life, but that I so account of myself.<a name=207:7></a> But when he adds, "Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal bodies to obey it in the lusts thereof," it is a plain testimony that it is not gone, or it would be a very poor conclusion -- besides other passages, that "the flesh lusts against the Spirit," and that "if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves.<a name=207:8></a>" The "always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus," is assuredly the holding the flesh practically dead.<a name=207:9></a> The circumstances which tested it, delivered to death, are in the following verse.<a name=207:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		They should explain what they mean by being actually dead, for to me it has no meaning at all.<a name=207:11></a> If it is merely that the motions of sin are not in activity, that may be the case.<a name=207:12></a> But if they think that the flesh is changed, and that sin is not there, they deceive themselves, and it always leads to self confidence and self esteem one of the most mischievous fruits of the flesh The Christian purifies himself, but does not reckon himself pure The reckoning applies to the estimate of the two natures: do I say I am alive, I mean alive to God as born of the Spirit, if he refers to flesh, he does not own it as life, but reckons it dead.<a name=207:13></a> Besides it is seldom never in words said that the flesh is dead, but that I am.<a name=207:14></a> It is once said the body is dead because of sin, while actually it is not so, or our old man is crucified with Him, which actually it was not.<a name=207:15></a> If they say, "I am dead" is actually so, they are clearly talking nonsense.<a name=207:16></a> Exaggerated truth is always error, and leads to the denial of the real truth, and ceases necessarily to be experimental, for what is not true cannot be true in me.<a name=207:17></a>

		MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I quite agree with you as to kneeling, and do so unless standing up, so as to be heard when praying myself, and so do the brethren who are not used to American churches; indeed, all at prayer meetings.<a name=208:1></a> When close packed, it is sometimes more difficult, but my spirit goes wholly with you in it.<a name=208:2></a> I was myself the beginning of what the world calls Plymouth brethren, though we began in Dublin.<a name=208:3></a> The name Plymouth arose from the earliest publications which attracted attention issuing thence, and was so far harmless, as no human name was attached to them; one cannot help the world giving some.<a name=208:4></a> The great question is, what the word of God says .<a name=208:5></a>.<a name=208:6></a>.<a name=208:7></a> .<a name=208:8></a> We do not meet on the ground of churches, but of the unity of the body of Christ, and membership of that one body.<a name=208:9></a> Membership of a church I do not find in scripture, nor a number of separate assemblies in one place (though as to mere locality they may be several, and meet in private houses, as at Jerusalem, but still be one assembly), and discipline in the church affects the standing of the person externally in the whole church of God.<a name=208:10></a> The great truth I find in scripture on this point is that the coming down of the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost formed believers into one body, members of Christ, the Head in heaven.<a name=208:11></a> God's assembly in each place represented this unity, undivided from all the rest, in that place.<a name=208:12></a> (See 1 Corinthians -- address of the Epistle.<a name=208:13></a>) The vital truth is the personal presence of the Holy Ghost, baptising into one body united to the Head.<a name=208:14></a> There is another character of the church, the habitation of God through the Spirit.<a name=208:15></a> The corruption of the dark ages has made the realisation of this more difficult, but has not altered the truth of the word.<a name=208:16></a> We have the promise which first led me to meet, that wherever two or three are gathered together in Christ's name, He is in their midst, only it must be in the unity of the body.<a name=208:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let me recur to a point I touched on when speaking with you.<a name=208:18></a> I do not doubt the Spirit of God is graciously working and rousing saints to the consciousness that something more earnest, more true, more what Christianity was at first, is to be looked for.<a name=208:19></a> In this feeling more undivided holiness of heart and life is justly looked for.<a name=208:20></a> Where this desire is not accompanied by the divinely given knowledge of the hopeless character of the flesh, illusion and consequent weakness accompanies the effort after it, or thought of receiving it.<a name=208:21></a> There is another work, another truth besides forgiveness, the consciousness that we have died in or with Christ (not merely that He has died for our sins) and in this the neck of self is broken.<a name=208:22></a> I know I am in Christ, and Christ in me: Christ is my place with God, not Adam: I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.<a name=208:23></a>" This is received in grace, and to me, then, to live is Christ; and I reckon myself dead indeed unto sin, and alive unto God <i>through Jesus Christ</i> our Lord.<a name=208:24></a> It is not simply being born of God, but, through the anointing of the Holy Ghost consequent on redemption, the consciousness of being in Christ and Christ in me the state of Romans 8.<a name=208:25></a> in contrast with the state in chapter 7, which is a renewed but undelivered man still under the law.<a name=208:26></a> Now I ought always to walk and have every thought in the Spirit, and only so, but that does not change the nature of the flesh.<a name=208:27></a> "Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lusts of the flesh"; but that does not change the lusts of the flesh.<a name=208:28></a> It lusts against the Spirit, "is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be"'; its mind is enmity against God.<a name=208:29></a> I have ever the right to reckon myself dead; to have no thought but what comes from the Spirit.<a name=208:30></a> But as the flesh is lawless without law; breaks the law, is not subject to it, when law is there; rejects Christ when God is present in grace so, even in him who has the Spirit, it lusts against it, and if a man has been in the third heaven would, if not kept down, puff him up about it.<a name=208:31></a> I have no need to watch against it, if it be not always an evil thing.<a name=208:32></a> When this is lost, the truth of a new life from Christ is lost with it.<a name=208:33></a> It is not the old Adam reformed, which is our life, but the last Adam, Christ, is our life; and, He having died for us, we have a right to treat the flesh as dead but that, because it is evil and unchanged in its nature, as what we have received in grace is pure and holy in itself, and I am to manifest only this, the life of Jesus in my mortal body: for this I must always bear about the cross.<a name=208:34></a> I will not go further, dear brother: I regretted missing you, but all is well.<a name=208:35></a> As I did, I write these few lines, and shall be glad to hear from you.<a name=208:36></a> Peace be with you, and the gracious and constant help of the blessed Lord.<a name=208:37></a>

		In many cases I judge they are inconsistent.<a name=218:9></a> Dear Bellett, who was thoroughly decided as to not admitting them, after sore trial of heart, was, from extreme kindliness of nature, and perhaps other mere human motives connected with his own personal character, in some cases inconsistent in this way, and felt on his death bed it was wrong.<a name=218:10></a> I should make a difference between misleaders and misled.<a name=218:11></a> For the Lord's table's sake, they must not have a false flag, false to Christ.<a name=218:12></a> But in my personal conduct, though I could not have communion with them in religious things, as members of the same body, true christian kindness would seek to make them feel their false position.<a name=218:13></a> Yet I should make a great difference between such and those who, untrue to Christ, sought to pervert.<a name=218:14></a> "Of some have compassion .<a name=218:15></a>.<a name=218:16></a>.<a name=218:17></a> and others save with fear": I see Satan's work, and would fain deliver.<a name=218:18></a> Satan's instruments are a horror to me, though even they may be delivered.<a name=218:19></a> If there is <i>bon fide</i> ignorance of facts not wilful, (for some refuse to know, to save the trouble of having their consciences exercised and they are not true to Christ) but <i>bon fide</i> ignorance, their conscience is not bad.<a name=218:20></a> If they had been connected in ignorance with leavened meetings, I should inquire and see if they were so in <i>principle</i>.<a name=218:21></a> If so, they are also false to Christ, they accept Christ and Belial going together; if they say no (if that is so, I should not walk with them on any account) I should not refuse them, only warning them that we knew things were so, and could not have communion with gatherings which were thus loose, and if they went back after warning, the case would be altered.<a name=218:22></a> What I look for is an honest and pure heart in the matter.<a name=218:23></a> Ignorance, when they have never had to say to Bethesda and her followers, is sufficient to preclude all further question: but ignorance alleged, when they have been counted with such gatherings, is saying that they do not know on what principle they were gathered, which may he, but which is strange; and at any rate they imbibe the spirit and tone of looseness, which is exactly opposite to all the scriptural directions for the last days.<a name=218:24></a>

		All that is said of "<i>ad infinitum</i>" is merely the repetition of what we have too often hardened has no real sense the moment the Church is known to be one.<a name=218:25></a> The question is, Does the person come from a place which has identified itself with the refusal to judge evil?<a name=218:26></a> It little matters to me how many steps a person is from the first who had the typhus fever in the country; five or fifty is all alike, if a man has got it.<a name=218:27></a> Evil is judged as evil wherever it is, and the argument is simply a denial of the church, and the unity of the body.<a name=218:28></a> If a gathering accepts fellowship with these one or fifty who have refused to maintain the glory of Christ, it is contaminated as such.<a name=218:29></a> -- would have left Bethesda; would he have gone to Bath or Dublin, in communion with B.<a name=218:30></a>, and receiving persons from it, yea, because they were of it, and whose members went there?<a name=218:31></a> This was the real case we had.<a name=218:32></a> Where there was intercommunion, there was moral identity, cases of <i>bon fide</i> ignorance excepted.<a name=218:33></a> They have turned to independency to avoid the evident consequence themselves as I stated to you; they have found the evil, and are now willing to exclude heresies; but I hear nothing of <i>unity</i>, so that there is no guarantee for security as to what others do, so that gatherings can be owned.<a name=218:34></a> If they are honest and faithful in this, the reason for excluding persons belonging to them might fail, but the gathering itself denies unity, and its responsibility as to connection with other gatherings, nor is there honest confession.<a name=218:35></a> They would not be bound by a discipline common to all; each person would have to be received by brethren individually; only belonging to a gathering thus faithful would not of itself be the ground of exclusion, their connection with others remaining to be inquired into.<a name=218:36></a> Only where they have been in communion with B.<a name=218:37></a> and those associated with it, one has alike a right and a duty to ask if they have given it up.<a name=218:38></a> If they refuse to say, they are not honest, and have not done so.<a name=218:39></a> They maintain this unholy liberty to do evil, and have not judged the evil in themselves.<a name=218:40></a> A person may be an active seducer from want of faithfulness as to Christ, or mislead; but the thing in question is Christ and principle.<a name=218:41></a> The making a difference between misleaders and mislead, has nothing to do with its not being a question of Christ and principle.<a name=218:42></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All this reasoning I find very sad.<a name=218:43></a> It tastes of B.<a name=218:44></a>, and those who sustain it.<a name=218:45></a> In this country (Canada) we have acted on the principle of refusing those belonging to bodies who allowed, heresies, having nothing to do with B.<a name=218:46></a>, but denying the immortality of the soul, and the results have been blessing, and the state of things around us every way confirmed us in the need of faithfulness.<a name=218:47></a> I shall own no gathering once in connection with B.<a name=218:48></a> and its supporters, which had not given it up, nothing more simple; they are indeed formally inside the camp.<a name=218:49></a> I have already spoken of cases of ignorance, but if a person deliberately chose to continue in connection with loose principles, I could not own him; he has not a pure heart in his worship it is a mercy to himself that he should learn it.<a name=218:50></a> It soon comes distinctly out, if there is faithfulness.<a name=218:51></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One of the most striking things in my late labour in the Western States has been, that everywhere by being faithful and holding to the Word, persons esteemed and active in union prayer meetings and the like, have professed themselves infidels, Socinians, deniers of the immortality of the soul, of the inspiration of the word of God, and the like.<a name=218:52></a> They were strange and trying scenes, but useful; but I felt I had the immense comfort of having only to bring forward scripture.<a name=218:53></a> It had not got so far in the loose gatherings everywhere, but it had got very far indeed; only many have been frightened, but those of the loose gatherings who came to this country are in full fellowship with this state of things, lead the meetings, etc.<a name=218:54></a> They have gone back into the camp just when the saints are called out of it.<a name=218:55></a> I know one of the nicest of them boasting that he had succeeded in contaminating a young saint, so that now he could not be received among us: the latter is now grown worldly and flourishing in the religious world.<a name=218:56></a> I seek to be separated to Christ from current evil, they will not.<a name=218:57></a> I never heard an argument on that side which was not for more or less tolerating evil.<a name=218:58></a> When forced they would leave it where it discredited them, but retain as much liberty as they could under the plea of charity: such a person's conscience is not purged, he cannot but defile others if allowed.<a name=218:59></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A passage that gave me a clue on my first starting, was in that wonderful chapter, Jeremiah 15.<a name=218:60></a> "If thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth: let them return to thee, but return not thou unto them.<a name=218:61></a>" Take the epistles or chapters which refer to the last days, and see if in all, separation from evil be not what is pressed.<a name=218:62></a> Patience and grace are required, but no acceptance of evil.<a name=218:63></a> It is Christ, it is principle, it is faithfulness and obedience, which are in question and we have acted on it in other cases than B.<a name=218:64></a> It is the great question: Is the church of God to confess and hold, to maintain the truth with Him that is holy, Him that is true?<a name=218:65></a> and then, whether there is one body formed upon the earth?<a name=218:66></a>

		If a person comes from a gathering which has been connected with B.<a name=218:67></a>, I am entitled and bound to ask him, Has it broken with it?<a name=218:68></a> If not, have you broken with it?<a name=218:69></a> If the person says no, I ask, How comes that?<a name=218:70></a> He may be ignorant, though it is very rare.<a name=218:71></a> I should say, We cannot walk with that gathering because it is unfaithful.<a name=218:72></a> If he says he prefers going with it as it is; he judges himself, he is unclean.<a name=218:73></a> If he says, I know nothing of the facts, I would tell him what was the principle of action, and sufficient of the facts to shew the application of the principle.<a name=218:74></a> If he honestly says, If the facts are so, I would not walk with them a moment, I am in a very great measure relieved.<a name=218:75></a> If he say, If it be so, I will not walk with them any more, I should be content.<a name=218:76></a> If he say, I had rather wait and inquire, one has only so to leave it.<a name=218:77></a> If he refuse to hear the facts or be informed, he has a bad conscience; he prefers walking loosely to taking a little trouble for Christ's glory; his heart is unsound, as a man who would refuse to be examined by a priest for leprosy; he condemns himself.<a name=218:78></a> All this requires patience and toil of heart, but the grace of Christ is sufficient for us, and grace and quiet firmness as to evil, will meet its sure reward.<a name=218:79></a> A work of Satan has been going on, alleging that evil doctrine was no matter: people have been mixed up with it; I must know if they are clean where they have been, or I am accepting the evil as no matter.<a name=218:80></a> I do not expect to carry on the work of the Lord without Satan trying to throw difficulties in the way, but I do count on the blessed Lord's faithfulness to be with us, and difficulties are a gain if that be the effect.<a name=218:81></a>

		My Dear Samuel Deck, -- I am glad for your own sake that your tract is withdrawn; you will perhaps, ere I write this, have received a letter from me.<a name=223:1></a> Its effect I had no fear of, for the simple reason that it wholly gave up all the principles brethren meet on, and would be judged by every intelligent brother.<a name=223:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The loose brethren have done so pretty generally.<a name=223:3></a> I could give you very easily an account of all those you speak of, but feel it is better to avoid speaking of individuals.<a name=223:4></a> The question is not whether they are logically in precisely the same position as the blasphemers, but whether their position justifies their not being received to communion.<a name=223:5></a> They are not according to scripture "a new lump," if they acquiesce in evil in their midst, not clear of the committed sin.<a name=223:6></a> So jealous is the apostle as to the truth, that a simple friendly adieu makes a man partaker of his evil deeds, how much more a wilful, determined reception of them into communion one of the pastors holding most of the blasphemous doctrines, and when the loose brethren pretended that Bethesda had changed, and acted in discipline, C.<a name=223:7></a> declared they had not, and that as far as he knew, they would do the same in like case, and that he did not know a single person at Bethesda who held Mr.<a name=223:8></a> N.<a name=223:9></a> for a heretic.<a name=223:10></a> This was Mr.<a name=223:11></a> Craik's published statement long after the matter had happened.<a name=223:12></a> It was the open support of blasphemy, and the breach took place by an effort on the part of neutrals to force us to go on with B.<a name=223:13></a>, as they openly stated and I personally know.<a name=223:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is no such thing as members of a local church or not local in scripture, but members of Christ, a totally different idea; he speaks of foot, hand, eye, etc.<a name=223:15></a>, you have only to read the whole passage (1 Corinthians 12), and not a shadow of doubt can remain.<a name=223:16></a> Members are members of Christ, whatever may mean; but it cannot have the meaning you put upon it, as it does not apply to what they were members of.<a name=223:17></a> But now as regards the Seven churches, they are neither the unity of the body, nor directions how to act from the Head by the apostle, but judgment by Christ on their state (I get positive directions for my conduct in 2 Timothy), Christ's judicial estimate of the whole, and what He will do if they do not repent: and this has been used to shew we are to acquiesce in things as they are if so, with everything, and exercise no discipline at all, for none is spoken of.<a name=223:18></a> But it is Christ's judgment of the state of things.<a name=223:19></a> That is found very clearly stated elsewhere.<a name=223:20></a> Hence it is commonly taken, and I doubt not rightly for the history of the Church at large, to the end of Popery, and the end of Protestantism.<a name=223:21></a> Your use of it would go to allow all evil in an assembly, fornication, communion with idols and all else, and so it has been used.<a name=223:22></a>

		As to "<i>ad infinitum</i>," it is a mere bugbear; whatever associates itself with evil, be it three or three thousand or three million, is on the same ground.<a name=223:23></a> If I associate myself with a principle of action, what matter how many assemblies are engaged in it, if they are so?<a name=223:24></a> Besides, it is a denial of the unity of the body.<a name=223:25></a> I know of so many assemblies, discipline in one is discipline in all, and the denial of this shews plainly enough where you have all got.<a name=223:26></a> This is the whole question.<a name=223:27></a> B.<a name=223:28></a> is partaker thus in the guilt in question, if another gathering is in communion with it, receive from it as it is, goes to it, they are one: if fifty do it, they are one.<a name=223:29></a> I cannot own them as assemblies of God as a guarantee for integrity in one coming from them.<a name=223:30></a> I can make a difference between misleaders and misled, and allow for ignorance, but that is not the question.<a name=223:31></a> I sigh over those ensnared by the unfaithfulness of others, but I find them soon corrupted in principle.<a name=223:32></a> I have seen none where integrity has not suffered by having to say to it.<a name=223:33></a> Mr.<a name=223:34></a> Bewley, urging reconciliation, writes a pamphlet blaming us, and told me that Mr.<a name=223:35></a> Craik was a decided heretic, and ought to have been put out; and when I said, Why then do you blame me for not going there when he was not put out?<a name=223:36></a> I do not blame you at all, he replied, and then goes on to do his best to condemn us.<a name=223:37></a> I sigh over ensnared ones, but I am sick of this falseness which characterises all that are in it.<a name=223:38></a> -- says popery is all wrong, and stays in it.<a name=223:39></a> Episcopal and Presbyterian ministers say the state of things is all wrong, and stay in it.<a name=223:40></a> This is a system destructive to conscience and the habit of excusing evil is ruinous to the soul.<a name=223:41></a> "Holy," "True" (Revelation 3: 7), I find characterises Christ in His relationship to the church He approves to the end.<a name=223:42></a> The whole question is, Is the church of God to maintain the truth in unity?<a name=223:43></a> My experience of the opposite system in the States in all shapes has made me firmer than ever in the path of what is called exclusiveness -- exclusion of false doctrine and false practice, in contrast with protecting and excusing it.<a name=223:44></a>

		J Dunlop, I have had much on my mind, the question of those converted coming out confessedly in the unity of the body; and truth naturally comes in.<a name=226:1></a> The two services in these days are distinct, though they meet in one point.<a name=226:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		At the beginning, power was at the centre, and gathered into a known and sole centre or unity.<a name=226:3></a> If a person refused to come into it, he was still outside, and not owned as a Christian at all.<a name=226:4></a> Now, in Christendom, the unity of the body, and divine life and holiness being owned, the gathering into this is of persons already externally Christians -- perhaps really -- and who leave the present recognised, though false centres, and go "outside the camp.<a name=226:5></a>" In the meanwhile, a mass of persons, who are called Christians, have not life at all -- are not saved, and they are evangelised to save their souls, pretty much without any reference to gathering at all.<a name=226:6></a> The question is, putting these things together.<a name=226:7></a>
	</div>

		We began by (being already Christians) meeting, leaving the camp, and then set about evangelising with activity, and with pretty widespread blessing, which has extended over a pretty large part of the Continent.<a name=226:8></a> Since then considerable activity has existed in seeking souls, as in Canada and elsewhere, a good deal independently of our position in these last days, and the character of the gospel had not much connection with it.<a name=226:9></a> Hence the work of gathering had to be superadded.<a name=226:10></a> Without saying there were none converted (at our first coming out and preaching) which did not come out, for I have known such; still, it generally took that character.<a name=226:11></a> We had reading meetings of all sorts of Christians, but one after another they came out, and others seeing it, were afraid to come, and they for some years dropped off.<a name=226:12></a> Since then they have been found in various places.<a name=226:13></a> But where there was no mention of church questions or principles, the kind of full gospel I refer to made people come out.<a name=226:14></a> They could not stand the services they heard elsewhere, and the gospel itself laid the basis.<a name=226:15></a> Besides, many got hold of these truths who did not come out.<a name=226:16></a> But this preaching of redemption and unity made a difficulty sometimes for those who felt deeply we were in the last days, at the kind of gospel which knew nothing beyond a soul getting safe, and with little depth of action on the conscience, so as to make them look out for the right path; and this was often the case.<a name=226:17></a> It was getting safe -- an immense thing, I grant -- the essential thing; and for my own part, I have never preached separation, or what are called brethren's principles, but sought to bring needed truth to the soul where it was: if any person hated sectarianism it was myself: but I have a deep feeling of a Christian's being not of the world, and that we are in "the last days.<a name=226:18></a>" For this very reason God allows all manner of activity for conversion, and I thank Him for it.<a name=226:19></a>

		What I look for, dear brother, for myself, is, that those who are separated and gathered shew a life and detachment from the world, which is itself a testimony; otherwise the gospel with them, will sink into the common stream; others will gather the fruits perhaps.<a name=226:20></a> It is a choice of views, not separation to God.<a name=226:21></a> Next, that the gospel act freely on consciences, and being "bought with a price," and thereby being so utterly outside the camp oneself, that it may tell on those preached to.<a name=226:22></a> Then I believe our path is to bring to each soul the truth that soul needs, leaving the result to God.<a name=226:23></a> Amongst the gathered ones, and in intercourse as God furnishes occasion, the truth of the Church and its manifestation on earth will come out, and the presence of the Holy Ghost, unbelief in which is the great cause of the state of the professing church.<a name=226:24></a> Not to gain numbers, but to profit souls, according to Christ's own heart for them this is the great point; and so God will gather, and gather the consciences and faith of souls, and these by grace firmly.<a name=226:25></a> If opposition is violent, Paul's path at Ephesus may help to guide.<a name=226:26></a><br>[1873.<a name=226:27></a>]

		[H M Hooke] DEAREST BROTHER, -- You will perhaps be surprised to hear me say I do not like answering you (I do not say writing).<a name=228:1></a> I believe all is in such confusion in the church, and I so thoroughly prefer dwelling on Christ to ordinances, that I have no comfort in speaking of them, and specially of this; as our real work as to this is to get Christians clear practically of a great corrupt baptised body to which the Lord's supper helps; and the bringing them into it such as it is (though till judged it is owned of God -- not practically) does not present itself in thinking [of it] with attraction.<a name=228:2></a> I believe they should be; but as a child ought to come home to his Father's house, yet if the house be in disorder morally, there is not satisfaction in thinking of it, even though right, and we should be glad as to him to see him return The word of God remains the same, as Christ calls the temple His Father's house, though man had made it a den of thieves.<a name=228:3></a> I am the rather disinclined to take the subject up, not to trouble any brother's conscience.<a name=228:4></a> Indeed, the only counsel I ever gave was to be baptised because the person thought he ought, -- 's brother, of Cork, and he never was, the Baptist minister so put it in the place of Christ it drove him from it I have answered when asked, but never sought to persuade any -- only Quakers and unbaptised I have told that I thought they ought to be.<a name=228:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		You have given the true reasons for not re baptising: if it is initiatory, and reception into the house or public professing assembly on earth, you cannot introduce him if he has been.<a name=228:6></a> If this has been <i>bon fide</i> done, done with this object, hence called christening, it is done; and a second service cannot be this, but only on the ground of being declaratory and obedience, which you yourself reject, as indeed baptising brethren themselves do generally now, and which are clearly unscriptural.<a name=228:7></a> The only question then is, are the children of believers entitled to be so received?<a name=228:8></a> Now the rejecting them as infants was clearly not God's way of old, nor Christ's mind.<a name=228:9></a> It is the question, are they entitled to be received into the habitation of God by the Spirit, or are they to be left in the world of which Satan is prince?<a name=228:10></a> Now in Matthew the <i>general</i> character of infants in God's sight is clearly stated: their angels behold the face of His Father.<a name=228:11></a> It is not His will that one should perish, and that referred to His saving like a lost sheep.<a name=228:12></a> This clearly refers to infants as such, not those who have as Christians a character like them it would be poverty itself as to them; He had the child in His arms.<a name=228:13></a> It is said this is not baptism.<a name=228:14></a> Clearly not.<a name=228:15></a> But it is not merely or at all Jewish, "of such is the kingdom of heaven.<a name=228:16></a>" Now the kingdom of heaven was not then set up; now it is, and such belong to it.<a name=228:17></a> They are of it, and ought to be admitted to its privileges.<a name=228:18></a> I know no administrative entrance to it on earth but baptism.<a name=228:19></a> It was the prescribed order down on earth.<a name=228:20></a> But when I come to 1 Corinthians 7: 14, I think I get the question specifically decided.<a name=228:21></a> It is directly the subject.<a name=228:22></a> If a Jew married a Gentile he was profaned (not profane, a profane thing cannot be profaned) and was to send away his wife and children (see Ezra and Nehemiah): was it so under grace?<a name=228:23></a> No, the converse; the unbeliever was sanctified (opposite to profaned, not holy) and the children were holy, to be received, not cut off.<a name=228:24></a> Hence the word is "unclean," the force of which as precluding approach to the house of Jehovah in Israel is well known.<a name=228:25></a> There is a place where God sets His blessings besides individual conversion, I mean down here.<a name=228:26></a> Thus Romans 11 and the sacramental place on earth (1 Corinthians 10) answers to this in Judaism; hence, as you recognise, special judgment on it, and it is called the house of God, though spoiled with false doctrine in man's hand, still judged as God's house and temple, though wood and hay and stubble be in it.<a name=228:27></a> Without this indeed there could not be apostasy.<a name=228:28></a> Hence the Lord, and the faith (not personal, but the "one faith") and baptism are associated.<a name=228:29></a> In the baptism of a child there is plain testimony to the need of Christ's death for its admission.<a name=228:30></a> I trust you will not press -- 's conscience the least.<a name=228:31></a> Should you even feel bound to do it, leave her quite at liberty not even to be present if she is not free, or a mere looker on if she wish to be it.<a name=228:32></a> Your own conscience God will direct.<a name=228:33></a> Take it quietly for yourself and for her.<a name=228:34></a> I trust and pray, nor do I doubt His goodness, that the gracious Lord will be with her in her hour of need, and may He give her to rest as a child in His arms, and trust His gracious care .<a name=228:35></a>.<a name=228:36></a>.<a name=228:37></a> .<a name=228:38></a>

		[Mr Ulrich] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I was very glad to hear you were getting on happily.<a name=230:1></a> As to the question you refer to, it is one which exercised the brethren early in their career, but I think they have all settled pretty positively in the conviction that all the saints will be with Christ at His coming.<a name=230:2></a> I cannot object to the statement, that the crown of righteousness is laid up for those who love His appearing, nor that in fact He will appear to those that look for Him.<a name=230:3></a> But the parable of the wise and foolish virgins gives me the comfortable assurance, that the Lord will wake up to expect Him those that have oil in their lamps, and even many will be aroused to activity who have not.<a name=230:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another thing that, at the time the question was mooted, acted on my judgment: all who are really members of His body must be with Him.<a name=230:5></a> You cannot divide the body.<a name=230:6></a> Again, if forming part of the bride they must be there, and it is clear that whoever has the Holy Ghost is of the body: "By one Spirit we have all been baptised into one body.<a name=230:7></a>" Further, I read in 1 Corinthians 15, "they that are Christ's at his coming," so those that sleep in Jesus in 1 Thessalonians 4; and when one thinks of the resurrection, it seems impossible to confine it, for scarce one would be raised.<a name=230:8></a> How few saints comparatively have died since the Lord's coming was scripturally preached.<a name=230:9></a> If it merely applied to those that are alive at the time, I have no great objection, because I believe God will wake them up.<a name=230:10></a> But I cannot believe that the foolish virgins who have no oil in their vessels, and to whom the Lord says, "I know you not," are true Christians.<a name=230:11></a> That worldly minded Christians may go through tribulation (not "the great tribulation") to separate them from the world and make them expect Christ is very possible and very probable, but that is only God's faithful care over His children, what is needed for their good and deliverance as such.<a name=230:12></a> The great tribulation is either Jewish as in Matthew 24, or over the whole world after the church is gone (Revelation 7); with neither of these has the church to do.<a name=230:13></a> The unity of the body seems to me to make the exclusion of saints now and heretofore who have not seen the Lord's coming from a part in that blessing, untenable; but saying that only those waiting for Him when He comes is not; only that I find that He wakes up the saints in time before He comes, that they may be ready.<a name=230:14></a>

		What you have already quoted is a clear proof that Peter was a believer.<a name=231:3></a> "Ye are clean.<a name=231:4></a>" (John 15: 3.<a name=231:5></a>) He adds likewise what renders the passage stronger in chapter 13, "Ye are clean, but not all," speaking of Judas, who betrayed Him.<a name=231:6></a> This is not all: the Lord prayed that Peter's faith should not fail, and so it was.<a name=231:7></a> He had faith then, and that as we learn in Matthew 16, through the revelation of the Father Himself Election has nothing to do with it -- it is true that it is before the foundation of the world -- the being clean has much.<a name=231:8></a> It confounds the new birth and the sealing, "After that ye believed ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise.<a name=231:9></a>" (Ephesians 1: 13.<a name=231:10></a>) "The Holy Ghost was not yet given, because that Jesus was not yet glorified.<a name=231:11></a>" (John 7: 39.<a name=231:12></a>) But the passage in Galatians marks clearly the difference between new birth and sealing.<a name=231:13></a> "Ye are," chapter 3: 26 tells us, "all children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.<a name=231:14></a>" Then (chapter 4: 6), "Because ye are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.<a name=231:15></a>" "Because ye are sons," not in order that ye may be; it could not be more clear.<a name=231:16></a>

		As to the question: the Old Testament saints were born of God, but they could not call themselves children of God, because, redemption not being accomplished, the Spirit of adoption was not given; they could not take that position.<a name=233:8></a> The word is clear on this point.<a name=233:9></a> This is the force of John 1: 12.<a name=233:10></a> Those who, through grace, being born of God, received Christ, received right (authority) to take the position of children.<a name=233:11></a> Also the Epistle to the Galatians explains the difference fully and clearly, "The heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all .<a name=233:12></a>.<a name=233:13></a>.<a name=233:14></a> .<a name=233:15></a> But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth His Son .<a name=233:16></a>.<a name=233:17></a>.<a name=233:18></a> that we might receive the adoption [of sons].<a name=233:19></a> And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.<a name=233:20></a>" (Galatians 4: 1-7.<a name=233:21></a>) "Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son"; then (Galatians 3: 26) "Ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.<a name=233:22></a>" The difference between saints under the old covenant and Christians is therefore clearly explained in the word.<a name=233:23></a>

		Dear Miss Fosberry, I hardly know whether it is worth while to answer what is merely teaching ignorance; besides, the book is not published.<a name=234:19></a> What shall I say to arguments which teach the perilous days of the last times (where I am to turn away from hypocritical profession) to be the great tribulation, which If God did not shorten, no flesh would be saved; which confounds the great tribulation of all nations (Revelation 7) with the tribulation marked by the setting up the abomination of desolation on which those in Judea are warned to flee to the mountains; which takes Luke 21: 25, 26 for the church's tribulation where they see the Son of man coming, when it is positively revealed that when Christ appears we shall appear with Him; which admits the difference of the church here, but supposes that <i>after death</i> they will be brought into the same condition; which quotes passages referring to being sons to prove that they are the same body, with which it has nothing to do?<a name=234:20></a> The whole object is to set aside the church, and from the universal cause, ignorance of their own place in it making union by faith, with which it has nothing to do; not seeing that there was no Head to be united to in the Old Testament; confounds the acting of the Holy Ghost with His coming; takes up the Hebrews to shew what the church is, which never speaks of the church (save in chapter 12.<a name=234:21></a> prophetically, and there distinctively from Old Testament saints) but of saints on earth in trial, and Christ, a separate person, in heaven.<a name=234:22></a> Was ever a greater <i>olla podrida</i> than page 15, quoting Hebrews 12: 22 to prove the Old Testament saints are the church, when verse 23 makes them a distinct set?<a name=234:23></a> Page 27 proves he has no idea at all of the body, quoting passages which say we are sons and heirs, Abraham's seed, which is individual, as if it touched the question of one body.<a name=234:24></a>

		[Mr Pinkerton] MY DEAR BROTHER, I was moving about in the blessed Lord's work, so that I did not get yours for two or three days after you would have expected.<a name=236:1></a> Your going on in this work was a matter of much exercise of soul to me if I can say much of any such not merely as to your going, but also because generally hitherto (save among the poor negroes in the West Indies, which is hardly that) God has not favoured an attempt by brethren outside the Babylon they have been a witness in.<a name=236:2></a> Two attempts were made, besides helping others, and both failed in result from, I believe, different cause one from death from the country fever in Syria when the language was learned .<a name=236:3></a>.<a name=236:4></a>.<a name=236:5></a> .<a name=236:6></a> Your affectionate brother in Christ.<a name=236:7></a>

		-- - I do not think that the promises refer to prayers offered up one for another only, though this is a large part of the cases put forward in scripture: "pray one for another," "for me also," "labouring earnestly for you in prayers," and many others; but the prayer of faith is not confined to this.<a name=236:9></a> There are prayers for opening the door for the gospel and for all men.<a name=236:10></a> If it be not the prayer of positive faith, we are told in all things to present our requests to God, but then the answer is, or may be only, that God's peace which passes all understanding shall keep our hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.<a name=236:11></a> For the prayer of faith, or rather the promise to it, there are certain limits as to the certainty of answer, such as "in my name," "according to his will," "if ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will," "if two of you shall agree"; besides what stops prayer, as a sin unto death.<a name=236:12></a> But then I see no limits put to the expectation of faith <i>if God gives it</i>.<a name=236:13></a> If it be my will asking amiss to consume it on my lusts, I cannot expect an answer.<a name=236:14></a> But the Lord contemplates the giving of faith and certainty of answer for drying up of the fig tree or removing a mountain, and whatever I can ask believing, I receive it.<a name=236:15></a> This is a very important principle.<a name=236:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But first, as to the limits on which formal promise of answer rests besides special faith.<a name=236:17></a> The first passage I may refer to is "If we ask anything according to his will he heareth us .<a name=236:18></a>.<a name=236:19></a>.<a name=236:20></a> and we know that we have the petitions.<a name=236:21></a>" This supposes the demand according to His will, and then we can reckon on His power accomplishing it.<a name=236:22></a> This is the general christian confidence, a great boon to be assured of the acting of Him who is Almighty in the way of His will.<a name=236:23></a> Next it is said, "If ye abide in me and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will.<a name=236:24></a>" Here I do not doubt there was special reference to the twelve, but in principle it applies to all Christians.<a name=236:25></a> Where the mind is formed by the words of Christ, when they abide in one who lives in dependence on and confidence in Him one thus abiding in Him, having Him in spirit, and his mind guided by Christ's word, his will is (so to speak) Christ's he asks what he will, and it will come.<a name=236:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another case is where any two are agreed: here individual will is set aside.<a name=236:27></a> It is where Christians have a common desire and agree to present it to God.<a name=236:28></a> The deliberate formal agreement supposes a common christian mind, and it will be done.<a name=236:29></a> So, when I ask, coming for what I can attach Christ's name to, under His auspices, the Father will do it.<a name=236:30></a> Here, I doubt not too, the twelve are specially in view; still it is in principle every Christian.<a name=236:31></a> A man cannot in faith bring Christ's name attached to his lusts; and all these statements suppose the disciple and faith, as James expressly teaches us, and indeed the Lord Himself.<a name=236:32></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there are other statements which cast us more generally on the goodness of God, His interest in us, and shew that, where faith is in exercise, the answer will be there: "All things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing ye shall receive.<a name=236:33></a>" This supposes faith and intimacy, so to speak, with God.<a name=236:34></a> The heart is supposed to be in His interests, and then, if there is faith as a grain of mustard seed, a mountain goes.<a name=236:35></a> I do not doubt this kind of faith was much more when any, as the apostles, felt themselves interested in God's cause, identified with Him and it on the earth; but there is no limit to it.<a name=236:36></a> Where such faith is, such answer will be; and God is as much occupied now with the details of blessing for us as for the great deeds of those days.<a name=236:37></a> It might be more palpable, more concentrated too then, but not more true.<a name=236:38></a> Not a sparrow falls now without Him more than then; and the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availing much is ever true: only we must, so to speak, put ourselves with God, for those to whom these things were said were identified with Him in His interests on the earth.<a name=236:39></a> This gave their prayers of course a peculiar place; but then if faith (that is, the operation of His Spirit and grace) brings me into His interest now even in details, the promise is there, and we can reckon on God and His power exercised in love now as then.<a name=236:40></a> There is no limit: only it is the working of His Spirit in us, and hence faith that reckons on the answer.<a name=236:41></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Presenting our requests, subject to His will, is always right.<a name=236:42></a> Of this we have an example even in Gethsemane; so Paul for his thorn in the flesh.<a name=236:43></a> And the answer will be more glorious and blessed than the request, even when it does not as asked answer it.<a name=236:44></a> See John 12.<a name=236:45></a> and Psalm 132: so Psalm 21, and even Paul's request about the thorn.<a name=236:46></a> Let us trust His love, and this will not come short, and if He has given us faith to expect a specific answer, bless God for it.<a name=236:47></a> Only our will must not come in; even if it was answered (this was the case of the quails), but as a rule not, as James teaches.<a name=236:48></a> But where there is earnest faith, God will surely hear, though He may give us safeguards against our own will in it.<a name=236:49></a><br>[1873.<a name=236:50></a>]

		[R H Griffiths] MY DEAR BROTHER, I find in general that people do not know what they mean by original sin.<a name=238:1></a> Is it a taint, as evil in nature, or a relative state with God?<a name=238:2></a> For instance, it is said, "By one man's disobedience many were made sinners.<a name=238:3></a>" But it is never said Christ has entirely put away sin in any sense.<a name=238:4></a> He came once in the end of the world "to put away sin.<a name=238:5></a>" But the result is not yet produced.<a name=238:6></a> Faith knows it is effectual and rejoices.<a name=238:7></a> But the Holy Ghost convicts the world of sin because they believe not in Jesus, so that there they are -- sin increased upon them by the death of Christ.<a name=238:8></a> But I repeat, it is never said Christ has put away sin.<a name=238:9></a> He has done the work that does it, so that in the new heavens and new earth righteousness will dwell.<a name=238:10></a> So that my first answer must be the question, What do they mean by original sin?<a name=238:11></a> If it be the nature (as, for instance in the thirty-nine Articles), that is not put away at all, but condemned in the cross.<a name=238:12></a> If it be the relationship and standing of the sinner, it is not changed till he believes.<a name=238:13></a> Only the cross is the adequate and glorious ground on which, God being glorified and the blood before His eyes, He can send to every sinner beseeching him to be reconciled; but that proves he is not, till he answers to the call.<a name=238:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If it be meant that sins are put away (which is not original sin in any sense), and we remain guilty of unbelief, it is wholly anti-scriptural.<a name=238:15></a> The Lord says, "If ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.<a name=238:16></a>" And Paul, "Let no man deceive you, for because of these things the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience.<a name=238:17></a>" And men are judged according to their works, for the deeds done in the body.<a name=238:18></a> Only remember, with the vague words "original sin" we must know what they mean.<a name=238:19></a> The text generally, I suppose, applied to it is Romans 5: 19.<a name=238:20></a> But this says nothing as to putting away.<a name=238:21></a> But it is never said Christ has put away sin at all.<a name=238:22></a>

		[Dr Glenny] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- Your letter was so long delayed by my running about the country and my letters after me (I have been up as far as Aberdeen, and in many places in the north of England) that it is very likely that your decision may have been come to before you receive this.<a name=241:17></a> I have been anxious about it.<a name=241:18></a> The Lord will take care of you .<a name=241:19></a>.<a name=241:20></a>.<a name=241:21></a> .<a name=241:22></a> The thing that I fear is not seeking FIRST the kingdom of God and His righteousness.<a name=241:23></a> It is not the time only that a similar occupation takes, but its having the prior claim, which is important.<a name=241:24></a> It alters the whole tone of the mind.<a name=241:25></a> Adding, if we are able, work (like Paul) is an excellent thing, but it only came in for the gospel.<a name=241:26></a> If you feel increased practical experience an object, it is all well, and though preaching when I could I should then give it its own place.<a name=241:27></a> But your heart should see what place you are putting yourself in; it may be very desirable you should have the advantage of the practice, if so, set about it heartily.<a name=241:28></a> But see whether you are going to be a practitioner preaching, or a preacher practising: it may be done, for a time, though this is slippery ground.<a name=241:29></a> But I have more confidence in our gracious Lord guiding you than in any counsel I could give .<a name=241:30></a>.<a name=241:31></a>.<a name=241:32></a> .<a name=241:33></a>

		[Timothy Loizeaux] [From the French.<a name=242:1></a>] VERY DEAR BROTHER, -- Your letter calls for a serious examination.<a name=242:2></a> I suppose as to the principle that we are clear on one point, namely, that we are bought with a price and that we are not our own servants, blessed be God, in this poor ruined world, of the Lord by His great grace: and if besides the joy of being for ever with Him, there is one, it is that of being able to serve Him down here, the little while that we have for so doing, for it is only here that we can suffer with Him.<a name=242:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the question arises as to what He calls us -- for you, dear brother, if God has really called you to the ministry of the word, or if it is only that your practical faith wavers before the difficulties of the path.<a name=242:4></a> You must remember that God tests faith; He never fails us, but He makes us feel our entire dependence on Him.<a name=242:5></a> I see this in Paul: he had a thorn, he was often even hungry: he learnt to glory in his infirmities that the power of Christ might rest upon him.<a name=242:6></a> But the result was that he was instructed to be in abundance and in want, to be full and to be hungry "I can do all things through him that strengtheneth me.<a name=242:7></a>" Without were conflicts, within were fears, and he gained the knowledge of God as the One who comforts those that are cast down.<a name=242:8></a> Then it was worth while being cast down.<a name=242:9></a> But he was able to say, not who "causeth us to triumph," but who "leadeth us in triumph" having missed the open door at Troas, being in great conflict with regard to Corinth, but able to say, in order to be "a sweet savour of Christ," wherever he was.<a name=242:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The question of his call to the ministry was certain.<a name=242:11></a> If grace had not sustained him here, he could have returned like John and Mark: woe be to him, as he always said, if he preached not, and he did so without his will ( a[kwn ): being sent assuredly of God, he could not doubt having been sent.<a name=242:12></a> The words of the Lord near Damascus and the prophecy at Antioch were too positive.<a name=242:13></a> Now neither our mission, nor any part of the work of the Lord, has this distinctness.<a name=242:14></a> Our word is not confirmed by accompanying signs.<a name=242:15></a> This does not trouble me.<a name=242:16></a> It demands more of the heart's confidence, confidence in Christ, and that always does good.<a name=242:17></a> But it strengthens the heart greatly to be assured of it.<a name=242:18></a> Then if there are difficulties on the way, there are but difficulties to overcome.<a name=242:19></a> If I have not this assurance in starting, it is a question if I am in my place: in any case God can exercise us here for our good.<a name=242:20></a> Not only that, but when God has clearly called some one either by the ardour of his faith like Moses, or by any formal calling like Paul, He can put him aside.<a name=242:21></a> Moses during forty years kept the sheep of his father in law, and Paul had not any active mission, to reduce the fleshly activity which might mix itself in his work with the activity purely from God, and to make him learn his entire dependence.<a name=242:22></a> It was Barnabas who put Saul afresh to the work; then came the mission of Antioch.<a name=242:23></a> But the heart is in these cases always in the work, but retired with God, in such a manner that God has a larger place in the heart, and our labour is afterwards more directly with reference to Him.<a name=242:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There then, dear brother, is the question for you: Are you truly called to labour for the Lord?<a name=242:25></a> that is to say, to go about in His work, for we all ought to labour for Him.<a name=242:26></a> When we are, faith may fail; yes, but we are miserable if we abandon it, as Jeremiah said when he did not wish to speak any more, "But his word was in my heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones.<a name=242:27></a>" If it is only a fire that crackles in the thorns, it will soon be extinguished.<a name=242:28></a> But if you feel that the Lord has entrusted you with His word, has put it into your heart, not only for yourself, but for others (Galatians 1: 15, 16), then fear nothing: faith tested is faith strengthened; it is to have learnt your weakness, but to have learnt the faithfulness of God, His tender care even in sending the difficulties, that we may be there with Him.<a name=242:29></a> And if you have the assurance that God has entrusted you with His word, do not be troubled if you are set aside for a time.<a name=242:30></a> One learns one's lack of courage, at least, I have learnt it, but God takes account of what we are, gives us our thorn, that we may be humbled, and that we may feel that the strength and work are of Him.<a name=242:31></a> No doubt we have to judge our want of courage.<a name=242:32></a> For my part, it is my greatest test, the want of aggressive courage, and the way in which I shrink back before the coarseness of the world.<a name=242:33></a> But there is the look towards God who has pity for us.<a name=242:34></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Profit then by your present separation from the work to be much with Him.<a name=242:35></a> You will learn much inwardly in your capacity to go forward, much of Himself, then more distinctly if God has really sent you, which gives great inward power in following out the work.<a name=242:36></a> But do not doubt His faithfulness.<a name=242:37></a> It is forty-five years that I have served Him since I left nationalism.<a name=242:38></a> Oh, how ungrateful I should be if I did not testify to His faithfulness, and to His great and sweet and precious patience with His poor servant.<a name=242:39></a> It is a joy to me now to see others raised up to continue the work, and I hope better than I, for that can well be, though I by no means doubt of a special work in these last days.<a name=242:40></a> But the workman is another thing.<a name=242:41></a> I have laboured, God knows; but I have been more of a hewer of wood and drawer of water for those who have more courage.<a name=242:42></a> But we are what God gives us and permits us to be.<a name=242:43></a> God is reviving His work in Europe, and evidently, which encourages us, and comforts us, and gives in many respects an open door in spite of the evil, and often even by means of the evil .<a name=242:44></a>.<a name=242:45></a>.<a name=242:46></a> .<a name=242:47></a>

		Dear Mrs.<a name=245:1></a> Batten, -- I have read the little tract, and it has made me clearer as to the ground these people are upon, and a curious experience I have had.<a name=245:2></a> Mr.<a name=245:3></a> verse was on the common ground of low Christianity, which leaves people open to this.<a name=245:4></a> "I have given up," he says, "the expectation of being overcome with waywardness and sin.<a name=245:5></a>" No wonder Mr.<a name=245:6></a> R.<a name=245:7></a> page S.<a name=245:8></a> had hold of him if this was his state.<a name=245:9></a> I treated this as a non-christian state fifty years ago.<a name=245:10></a> I may have been inconsistent with deliverance, but I do not see what more they have than what I got near fifty years ago, save that it is on false ground, on which it is impossible to make much progress; or at any rate their state, progress, and all is what I should utterly deprecate.<a name=245:11></a> It is not what frightens Mr.<a name=245:12></a> verse which frightens me, that is, the fact of communion not interrupted, or immediate consciousness of it, if it were.<a name=245:13></a> That is to me the normal christian state, only not talking of it and it may be a means of awakening your mind to something it has not yet got.<a name=245:14></a> But I am more convinced than ever, since I read Mr.<a name=245:15></a> V.<a name=245:16></a>'s tract, of its positively lowering tendency I mean of leading to a sorrowfully lower standard and style of Christianity than what scripture presents to us; what scripture calls "beholding with unveiled face the glory of the Lord.<a name=245:17></a>" I hold the difference clearly in my spirit.<a name=245:18></a> It may bring down Christ to give a quiet, trusting spirit down here, but it never takes the man up to Christ up there, so as to exercise the soul in conformity to Him there.<a name=245:19></a> It is a Christianity of grace for the earth, to make man, as man, rest here; not to make him sit up there and have his conversation in heaven.<a name=245:20></a> It may be a peaceful, but it is a human Christianity.<a name=245:21></a> No one can read the tract of Mr.<a name=245:22></a> V.<a name=245:23></a>'s without seeing it is all about V.<a name=245:24></a>, not about Christ.<a name=245:25></a> Look at page 13, and see how it is entirely a state down here and a Christ for down here, that he is occupied with.<a name=245:26></a> Now Christ is for us down here, and most gracious and precious it is, but it is not a Christ up on high, to whom our affections are drawn up, and our holiness judged by our fellowship with that.<a name=245:27></a> I suppose Mr.<a name=245:28></a> verse never had been set free, and of course as to that, it is deliverance to him; but in making this an object which occupies us, it keeps the soul down here perhaps undisturbed by positive evil, but not rising up to Christ; and as the energy of the system declines, a constantly lowering standard; but at best, it is a Christ known for what we want down here.<a name=245:29></a> Promises are realised, not Christ; and promises for us down here.<a name=245:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I cannot but think Mr.<a name=245:31></a> verse never really knew God's love, and what always strikes me, is the fuss they make about what I take to be the normal state of a Christian, varying in degree of fulness, but always the truth of his condition unbounded confidence in unbounded love, and love known in Christ, and enjoyed for its own sake.<a name=245:32></a> Look at the promises referred to by Mr.<a name=245:33></a> R.<a name=245:34></a> page S.<a name=245:35></a> in page 4: to what do they refer?<a name=245:36></a> realising Christ and spiritual conformity to Him in glory?<a name=245:37></a> Not a word.<a name=245:38></a> They refer solely to life down here.<a name=245:39></a> When I turn to John 15, where alone what is scriptural comes in, I find a teaching totally foreign to Mr.<a name=245:40></a> S.<a name=245:41></a>'s.<a name=245:42></a> His is entering by an act of faith into this trust and confidence, believing a promise.<a name=245:43></a> What is in John?<a name=245:44></a> "As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue [abide] ye in my love.<a name=245:45></a> If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.<a name=245:46></a>" Then, "these things have I spoken unto you that my joy might abide in you and your joy might be full.<a name=245:47></a>" If I take the context, I do not find a trace of what Mr.<a name=245:48></a> S.<a name=245:49></a> teaches, it is far and wide from it.<a name=245:50></a> Consequently I do not find in St.<a name=245:51></a> Paul exactly the kind of quietness and constant triumph that Mr.<a name=245:52></a> verse speaks of and expects.<a name=245:53></a> I read, "I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling": "without were fightings, within were fears; nevertheless God, that comforteth them that are cast down" he repented of writing an inspired letter.<a name=245:54></a> I admit victory is ours, and to be "in nothing terrified by your adversaries.<a name=245:55></a>" I recognise peacefulness of heart in entire confidence, in the Christian's path down here; but I do not think a Christian can seek Christ up there, nor in connection with His interests and His service here without experiencing a deeper knowledge of self, and the subtleties of self and the flesh, and distress through the craft of Satan and the mischief he does, than Mr.<a name=245:56></a> S.<a name=245:57></a>'s system knows anything about.<a name=245:58></a> I read of thorns in the flesh messengers of Satan to buffet.<a name=245:59></a> I read of "If need be ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations.<a name=245:60></a>" I read of great anguish of heart, this I admit was in service, but you cannot separate the state of soul from service.<a name=245:61></a> It is peace in life, not the sentence of death in ourselves: and I hardly think rivers of water flowing forth mean speaking of one's self or of one's own joy, though it may sometimes in the first overflowing of it be natural and right.<a name=245:62></a> But to turn grace into this channel I am sure lowers Christianity.<a name=245:63></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have no disposition to give up what I have got, and get assuredly in Christ, for what I find here.<a name=245:64></a> Assuredly not.<a name=245:65></a> I think I know what they have got better than they do, but it is occupation with their state and not what is in Christ which is before them.<a name=245:66></a> I could say more than this, but I prefer resting it on simply scriptural grounds.<a name=245:67></a> I recognise the joy of finding true liberty in grace, as I did in my tract.<a name=245:68></a> Very likely Mr.<a name=245:69></a> verse has found it.<a name=245:70></a> It may be you have not; so that it has a charm for you, but I am satisfied it is a system which lowers the whole character and tone of faith, and tends to keep the soul from all that is most precious in the revelation of God.<a name=245:71></a> I know I am a poor workman, but I would not have the system on which they work for any consideration.<a name=245:72></a> It is too much a Christianity for oneself, and not oneself in and for Christ.<a name=245:73></a> The whole platform is a different one, but I must not go any further.<a name=245:74></a>

		[Mr Pinkerton] DEAREST BROTHER, I was very glad to get a few words from you, though I had gladly heard from your letters to others how you had been getting on, and through mercy encouraged.<a name=248:1></a> I am one who has nothing sanguine in his nature, and I suppose you will meet with conflict and opposition, but if the Lord work none can let.<a name=248:2></a> And we have rather the promise of an open door, and none can shut it.<a name=248:3></a> It is strikingly so generally at this moment at any rate.<a name=248:4></a> Unless the gracious Lord specially interfere, one may, I suppose, count that it will be a slow work; yet I know all, and all hearts too, are in His hand; nor would I limit His working, as none can His power not so, dear brother, I call it to mind that if it be slow your heart may not be discouraged.<a name=248:5></a> In the midst of corruption and superstition, it takes much patience to wait on souls for their full deliverance; but grace and redemption clearly seen, does deliver, the rest passes away as a cloud.<a name=248:6></a> Though a habit of mind it is really Satan's power, and is gone where Christ's power is, and the Son and the truth have made free.<a name=248:7></a> When I began we were as nothing, but I find as much or more exercise of faith, now that the work has extended over a wide space, and many souls are to be thought of, as when we were a despised little band.<a name=248:8></a> Yet, I thank God, I do trust devotedness is growing; and under grace, growing infidelity and superstition bring many souls to hear where a full Christ is preached.<a name=248:9></a> Complete salvation I find of all moment now.<a name=248:10></a> It strikes at the root of all superstition, and builds up the soul on an everlasting foundation.<a name=248:11></a> Blessed comfort, fruit of infinite and perfect love!<a name=248:12></a> And soon we shall be like Him and see Him as He is.<a name=248:13></a> Unspeakable joy and wondrous grace!<a name=248:14></a> We wait for His Son from heaven.<a name=248:15></a> I feel specially thankful to the Lord for His gracious leading in this eastern matter, and pray that you may be every way guided and helped.<a name=248:16></a> You need it, I know well, but may count on it, waiting humbly on Him.<a name=248:17></a> I well understand that you can judge better than I can of the openings and leadings of the Lord.<a name=248:18></a> But since you spoke to me of the Copts, I trust Alexandria may not be given up in the attractions of Syria I speak only from the interest awakened in my heart as to it.<a name=248:19></a>

		DEAR BROTHER, I write a line, not having been able to see you in my very hasty visit, to sympathise with you in your present trial, quite feeling hew real a one it is to you.<a name=249:1></a> I enter not only into the way this would exercise and naturally prey upon the mind in all its thoughts "the multitude of thoughts within me," as the Spirit of God deigns to speak.<a name=249:2></a> It is a serious trial to the father of a family, occupied as you are, to be deprived of sight.<a name=249:3></a> When the outward trial of being thus rendered comparatively helpless, brings all the heart into exercise, the subjection to God's will, the humbling ourselves under His mighty hand and contentment with whatever lot He may assign us and besides the question of an humbled will, there often arise doubts practically of His love, an impugning of His wisdom and almost a preference to be out of His hands, what Elihu calls a choosing iniquity rather than affliction.<a name=249:4></a> I do not say that this has been produced in you at all.<a name=249:5></a> I speak of the trial and temptation when such a case arises, and I speak of it, dear brother, that you may be helped by the remembrance of our Father's love, and turn at once to Him, and the assurance of His love.<a name=249:6></a> Remember that God, even our God, has better thoughts for us than rest or a portion <i>here</i>.<a name=249:7></a> He is educating us for a blessed and eternal rest, free from evil and all that would cause it, and He is bent on the blessing of His children; and moreover He is bound by His holiness to purge us suitably (though most graciously) for the <i>place</i> He has called us to.<a name=249:8></a> How often He lets Satan do this painful work, and try and sift us as Job!<a name=249:9></a> But His hand and will are behind it all.<a name=249:10></a> He gives His saints up to Satan's hand to a certain point, but only so far as to bring the heart fully to a bearing before Himself, and enter into deep questions with it, breaking down its pride.<a name=249:11></a> But not only was the tempter absolutely limited in what he was to do to Job, but it was the Lord who first proposed his case to Satan.<a name=249:12></a> He had His own end in it, as we see: Job gets into blessing with a knowledge of himself and of God, incomparably beyond what he had before.<a name=249:13></a> In all these cases, therefore, though Satan may sift and try us by a thousand trials without and thoughts within, our business is to think on His hand and love who originates it all as to the ultimate purpose.<a name=249:14></a> By its being the enemy the soul is sifted in it, tempted to murmur.<a name=249:15></a> God could not do that: and what flesh is, is fully brought out to us, and there is a giving up of self, which enables us infinitely better to appreciate God.<a name=249:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Be assured then of His love.<a name=249:17></a> "Tribulation worketh patience: and patience, experience; and experience, hope: and hope maketh not ashamed, because <i>the love of God</i> is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.<a name=249:18></a>" But for this we should murmur and complain -- think God <i>in spirit</i>, if not in <i>judgment</i>, hard and wrong.<a name=249:19></a> With the sense of His love we are more than conquerors: none of these things separate us from it.<a name=249:20></a> May we know that it flows from love, a love we have known by his not sparing Jesus, and by every step of His life in a world of evil.<a name=249:21></a> <i>A Jehovah of Israel</i> stood engaged to bless, and punish in government, most patient, no doubt, but still in government, which manifested outwardly the sense He had of such and such conduct.<a name=249:22></a> But <i>the Father</i> stands engaged to much deeper work.<a name=249:23></a> He keeps us in His own name as a <i>holy</i> Father, and thus deals with us according to that which, as such a Father, He would work in our souls.<a name=249:24></a> For such a blessing He is bringing His children in inward life to Himself.<a name=249:25></a> Alas, how much there is often to be done in us!<a name=249:26></a> Do not faint therefore, dear brother, if a rebuke is come thus.<a name=249:27></a> He speaks to you as a Father (and what a Father!<a name=249:28></a>) to a child chastening whom He loves.<a name=249:29></a> Trust His love; trust it for yourself, for your family, for everything be assured nothing escapes Him: and you will find in the end that it is not an ungracious act He has done.<a name=249:30></a> Let the thought of grace and of His perfect love come in between you and all your thoughts, and you will find His hand sweet though it smite you, and Christ your eternal portion sweet in a way you never knew before.<a name=249:31></a> The first feeling may be merely bowing to His hand and will; the next, the sweet recognition of His hand of love; and then, in a heart weaned from other things, a capacity to discover the excellency and enjoy the grace of Christ, which will make you bless the day the Lord sent it you.<a name=249:32></a> Be assured His love makes no mistakes with us.<a name=249:33></a> It is certain and infinite.<a name=249:34></a> We know it, poor wretched sinners as we are, by the gift of Jesus.<a name=249:35></a> And oh!<a name=249:36></a> what is our eternal portion in grace yea, glory with Him compared with wearying troubles here below?<a name=249:37></a> Better suffer in a world of sin.<a name=249:38></a> The manner of it must be such as makes us feel a good deal, or it would be no use.<a name=249:39></a>

		Dear F Cavenagh, -- I was very glad to hear of your getting on so happily in New Zealand.<a name=252:1></a> The circumstances there call for wise and holy walk in all concerned in the work.<a name=252:2></a> I suppose you are more occupied with evangelising than with church matters, but it was just this that dragged down our dear brother -- into co-operation with what now he sorrows over, and from which he has with so much faithfulness and self judgment, in grace, got free.<a name=252:3></a> The danger is to connect the gospel with what dishonours Christ.<a name=252:4></a> I see they have now at -- determined not to receive commendatory letters from Bethesda.<a name=252:5></a> This is well, and so far is honestly caring for the Lord's glory; but a principle has been evolved through this question, whether the church (an assembly) is bound to maintain the truth, is defiled itself if it allows defilement, and whether if persons continue in communion with those who deliberately receive such, they are not thereby themselves unfaithful.<a name=252:6></a> Are we not to keep ourselves pure?<a name=252:7></a> Thus a person comes to -- from B.<a name=252:8></a> and he will not break with it.<a name=252:9></a> They do not take B.<a name=252:10></a>'s letter in his favour, but they receive him who is morally one of the givers of the letter, and partaker of the evil which makes them refuse the letter.<a name=252:11></a> Where is the consistency of this?<a name=252:12></a> I have no unkindly feeling against B.<a name=252:13></a> as such, but I am bound, surrounded by a form of godliness denying the power, to keep myself pure.<a name=252:14></a> Is a gathering in the unity of the Spirit faithful in <i>its</i> testimony to Christ and the holiness of Christ's claim upon it?<a name=252:15></a> I desire the largest, fullest charity to every member of Christ's body, but it is not charity to acquiesce in sin in their walk, but the contrary.<a name=252:16></a> I must keep my own walk pure and faithful to Christ.<a name=252:17></a> I should in your place not occupy myself directly with it; but do not, in any wise, mix the gospel and your ministry with what is not faithful to Christ.<a name=252:18></a> It is unfaithfulness in ourselves, and helps on unfaithfulness as to Christ in others.<a name=252:19></a> The way they are gone down in England in every respect is frightful, though I doubt not at B.<a name=252:20></a> itself there are many dear saints.<a name=252:21></a>

		[Mons.<a name=253:1></a> Eynard] [From the French.<a name=253:2></a>] VERY DEAR BROTHER, -- It is indeed a great blessing to find ourselves tranquil in the midst of the agitation which reigns.<a name=253:3></a> Nearly fifty years ago I remarked that, when speaking of shaking the heavens and the earth (Hebrews 12: 26), Paul says, "he hath promised.<a name=253:4></a>" I, a conservative by birth, by education and by mind; a Protestant in Ireland into the bargain; I had been moved to the very depths of my soul on seeing that everything was going to be shaken.<a name=253:5></a> The testimony of God made me see and feel that all should be shaken, but .<a name=253:6></a>.<a name=253:7></a>.<a name=253:8></a> that we have a kingdom that cannot be shaken.<a name=253:9></a> Only we need that spirituality which detaches from the world, and attaches to the invisible things, in order to be free from the sorrow which the thought gives that all the surroundings of our ordinary life, with all its associations of ideas, are to be overturned.<a name=253:10></a> If I live in heaven, if my surroundings are there, my citizenship, if I am waiting for the Lord, instead of everything for me being shaken, all can only be perfected in glory; but in so far as we cling to what is earthly, the shaking, the uprooting of that which is second nature, is painful.<a name=253:11></a> A tree lives from its roots.<a name=253:12></a> How upset I have seen some of your old Genevese, when the fortifications, that had been raised to repel the attacks of the Bishop and Duke of Savoy, were destroyed!<a name=253:13></a> If was no longer their old Geneva; the town was improved and enlarged, without doubt, yet it was not their Geneva.<a name=253:14></a> But the bulwarks, the wall of the heavenly city will not be removed.<a name=253:15></a> This is a great consolation; but, as I have already said, it supposes the heart to be there.<a name=253:16></a> For my part, I am perfectly quiet.<a name=253:17></a>

		Now all institutions are being assaulted, if they are not already thrown down; and the great whore, without strength unless given to it by the beast, loudly proclaims her intention to ride upon the beast.<a name=253:18></a> Here, as well as elsewhere, these men proclaim it aloud.<a name=253:19></a> It is a plot, well organised at Rome, and systematically carried out.<a name=253:20></a> But if the floods rise, the Lord is above the flood, mightier than the noise of many waters.<a name=253:21></a> They rise, and plot their own ruin, even in this world, for judgment is coming.<a name=253:22></a> But our kingdom is in nowise affected, it is beyond it all, and the Lord whom we serve is above all.<a name=253:23></a> Besides, what peace do we not find in communion with the Father and the Son!<a name=253:24></a>

		With regard to converted children, my conviction entirely agrees with that of some trusted brethren I have consulted.<a name=255:6></a> First, one should be quite clear as to the conversion of the child, because children are without hypocrisy; so sensitive are they, and subject to the influence of impressions, that they sincerely believe they feel all, and do indeed feel what is at work around them.<a name=255:7></a> But if they have been actually and apparently converted, we should by no means persuade them to break bread.<a name=255:8></a> Let that arise naturally in their hearts, and if they desire to do so, ascertain if they are capable -- of course, as a child -- of discerning and acknowledging in it the body of the Lord; not to drive them away, but that they may do it with spiritual insight and true faith and understanding.<a name=255:9></a> It is not to be expected of them that they should explain everything like theologians, but that they should understand it is with you a matter of faith from the heart, and realisation of the broken body.<a name=255:10></a> If they are actually in the care of believing parents, there is not so much danger.<a name=255:11></a> If they have much intercourse with the world, it is well to be assured of their firmness.<a name=255:12></a> One must remember that they have not yet been tempted and tested by the allurements of the world; and there lies the danger, supposing that they are really in Christ.<a name=255:13></a> It often happens that what they have longed for while subject to influence exercised over them without feeling the check, becomes subsequently a hateful check and nothing else, and they abandon what later on perhaps they would have longed for.<a name=255:14></a> Hence the importance of that of which I have already spoken -- that they should be in the company of christian parents, by whom they may, as time goes on, be guarded and brought up before the Lord, that they may be cared for in a christian way.<a name=255:15></a> Invariably so soon as they are in active life, the world and lusts come in, besides the hope of a future in the world, to tempt them.<a name=255:16></a> But if the work is deep, <i>conscience</i> secures their apprehension of the Lord's supper, especially if the parents are faithful and the children are accustomed to care of every kind.<a name=255:17></a> Or if there is proved faithfulness in the child, then nothing hinders their breaking bread.<a name=255:18></a> It is by no means a question of right, but of that which is altogether best for those that according to the will of God are under the government of others.<a name=255:19></a>

		This is what has occurred to me in the attempt to reply to your letter.<a name=255:20></a> May God Himself lead and guide brethren in this respect, and in their dealings with the lambs of the Good Shepherd.<a name=255:21></a> And may they feel that it is a common care for all, and may they be of one heart about this matter.<a name=255:22></a> Greet all affectionately.<a name=255:23></a>

		Here I think there is much to encourage.<a name=256:8></a> It is quite the day of small things, and more a testimony to Christ and the walk that becomes His than any large winning of souls.<a name=256:9></a> Still there have been conversions, and decided progress among the Christians; two new meetings, and another where those labouring wait as unwilling to hurry till the materials are in a christian sense fit.<a name=256:10></a> The general state of things is miserable enough.<a name=256:11></a> For instance, at Rome, the Baptists, who made such a noise about -- , an interesting case, and who are in the front there, have forty inscribed on their list, it is well if they have ten at their meeting.<a name=256:12></a> But the worst is the little regard to morality.<a name=256:13></a> It is a people thoroughly demoralised, and money everything, and when evangelists are paid they are often what they ought not to be.<a name=256:14></a> The stricter discipline of brethren is here a resource for the heart and conscience.<a name=256:15></a>

		Dearest J B Stoney, -- The question as to what the testimony to be rendered is, is one of great importance what to put out before souls; but the passage (2 Timothy 1: 8) is as simple as possible.<a name=258:1></a> Not to be "ashamed of the testimony of the Lord" is the testimony itself not what it was.<a name=258:2></a> He was not to be ashamed of bearing witness to Christ the Lord.<a name=258:3></a> Paul was in prison for it; Timothy was not to be ashamed because shame was put on him who had borne the witness, but to partake "of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God.<a name=258:4></a>" Persons who live in the ease of Englishmen do not know what it is, but where Popery is rampant and liberty unknown, to be put in prison, or taken by the gendarme daunts and cows people.<a name=258:5></a> The world's reproach is on them.<a name=258:6></a> How many remained with the blessed Lord when He was taken, or with Paul even when he was?<a name=258:7></a> They were ashamed of the testimony of the Lord and of His prisoner without considering what the various exigencies of the church were to give a character to this testimony.<a name=258:8></a> Indeed, in such cases this development has no place.<a name=258:9></a> The testimony reduces itself to its simplest elements not being ashamed of Christ, set before the world in testimony.<a name=258:10></a>

		As to the work at Edinburgh, I dare say there may have been conversions, and one must bless God for that.<a name=258:18></a> But Moody before he came to England denied openly all work of grace in conversion, and denounced it as diabolical in his own pulpit.<a name=258:19></a> I hear he has got on in this subject, that M.<a name=258:20></a>'s tract did him good, which is in a great measure a rsum of brethren's teaching; the author not concealing in his intercourse with others where he learned it.<a name=258:21></a> But some of Moody's false doctrine was taught in his public ministrations at Edinburgh, according to R.<a name=258:22></a> and M.<a name=258:23></a>'s account, which no doubt is correct, for we discussed it at Chicago, and he held it there, namely, that no man is condemned for his sins, but for not coming to the refuge -- sins are all borne and put away for everybody.<a name=258:24></a>

		I am quite satisfied that the Scotch revival will make Christians more worldly and godliness more superficial than ever where it works.<a name=258:25></a> It takes means and avows principles which make unworldliness and spirituality impossible, and will make indifference to Christ's will, and to evil in the church, more powerful than ever.<a name=258:26></a> But then poor souls, stirred up by what was going on, and brought to hear that there was salvation, and that they needed it, may have been met by grace, and have found life and Christ, and that is joy.<a name=258:27></a> All the rest win, I believe, be positively evil.<a name=258:28></a> It has stirred up Christians, but to throw them on what is routine, not personally on Christ, and what will not really meet their need, and on working which is all right if flowing from Him, but not as replacing Christ for peace and blessing.<a name=258:29></a> Next year I will tell you the rest, and shall always rejoice in every converted soul, and so will the Lord.<a name=258:30></a> I know the effect of the system in America and under Moody's own care.<a name=258:31></a> Here it is new, and may awaken.<a name=258:32></a>

		[F G Brown(e?<a name=260:1></a>)] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I have reserved my answer, which I could not send at once, till I arrived here, as I thought you would be interested as to the Lord's work and the state of things.<a name=260:2></a> After leaving Ireland, which I should not have left, so full was the work on my hands, I went to the south of France, to spend a fortnight with the brethren labouring there, our 'Guelph' meeting.<a name=260:3></a> Besides the brethren of the locality and neighbourhood, there were seventy one, a few of them young brethren interested in, though not occupied as yet in, the work; the rest, labouring brethren from a large circuit round.<a name=260:4></a> We had, I trust, a very profitable fortnight, and the happiest spirit reigned amongst the brethren.<a name=260:5></a> We read Acts, Romans, 1 and 2 Timothy, Daniel, and the first chapter of John.<a name=260:6></a> In the evening, lectures, as there was a great desire to hear in the place; and we had crowded meetings, I trust with blessing and testimony to those around.<a name=260:7></a> At Nmes, a large town, where I thought perhaps from circumstances I might not even have gone, great numbers had to go away.<a name=260:8></a> One thing that has brought many to hear is the open infidelity of Protestant clergy, so that while endless questions are raised in the people's minds, serious persons are driven to have truth elsewhere.<a name=260:9></a>

		But what a change since I was there some twenty-five years ago, just picking up here and there a soul, with a little company in a room to hear, and they uncertain.<a name=260:10></a> Where we had the meeting -- a large village -- there was no meeting, and one or two Christians at most, who have never come, save just to hear.<a name=260:11></a> Still I have felt there has not been the power there ought among brethren.<a name=260:12></a> Free churches, so called, have been formed, and though unequivocally formed of those who had not courage to break with the world, yet I feel there ought to be power with brethren to gather such, or at least, leave their consciences self-judged.<a name=260:13></a> It is poor work to form them on their own ground of semi-worldliness; and that is what the Free church does, but it is an evil, because it quiets their consciences.<a name=260:14></a> In these quarters they only subsist in imitating brethren; have the Lord's supper every Lord's day; different brethren break the bread, and there is liberty of ministry.<a name=260:15></a> Otherwise they could not subsist; too much light has spread, but all this is hollow work.<a name=260:16></a> But I think it is humbling for brethren to have it by them, for I cannot but feel that more spiritual power would have put them in their place.<a name=260:17></a> Their minister, for they have one, though he disdains his place as chosen pastor, said honestly before us all (he came several days to the meeting), that he had learned almost everything from brethren, but then such always spoil it: he taught the Lord's coming, but made a strange mess of it -- none of them in the church's place; they never can: however, my intercourse with him was fraternal and happy so far.<a name=260:18></a> I spoke three times at times on the Lord's coming, and there was the greatest and increasing attention.<a name=260:19></a> I was afterwards at Marseilles and Cannes, the Lord helping and blessing.<a name=260:20></a> The brethren in general are getting on happily all round those parts, and in two places, where they had been in a low state, the Lord has put to His hand in blessing.<a name=260:21></a> Still in one corner there is need of rousing and an efficient workman.<a name=260:22></a> But religiously the whole state of the country is changed: there are fifty Christians for one when I first came, and therewith the National body publicly infidel; so that not merely Christians are at their wits' end, but the government have taken up the question on some petition to the Senate.<a name=260:23></a> The Roman Catholics say openly the Protestants are destroying themselves.<a name=260:24></a> The doctrine of the Lord's coming has spread everywhere astonishingly: all are aware of that; and the feeling that we are in the last days.<a name=260:25></a>

		Dear T Roberts, -- Only a word in reply to your letter as to your boys.<a name=273:1></a> It is of importance that boys growing up, though yours are somewhat young for this, should have companions: the heart grows with the body.<a name=273:2></a> Also it is important that they should have exercise.<a name=273:3></a> The important point is that their companions should be desirable ones: if they are strongly attached to such, mere companionship for games for exercise is not of much consequence still always to be feared.<a name=273:4></a> If your boys have young friends enough to give zest to their walks and excursions, and any other things that are good for bodily and even mental development, it is enough, but young ones (not exactly children) must have opportunity to let their hearts out freely.<a name=273:5></a> It is of all importance; and salutary companionship of all moment.<a name=273:6></a> It is of the last importance for parents to get this through God's mercy into a right channel.<a name=273:7></a>

		Dear F Kingscote, Intercession<a href="#273:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> is a general term, used even of the Holy Ghost in us (Romans 8); but priesthood (in Hebrews) is with God, for mercy and grace to help in time of need: advocacy with the Father, to restore communion when we have sinned.<a name=273:10></a> You could not have it for sins in Hebrews, because the worshippers once purged have no more conscience of sins.<a name=273:11></a> This answers your three first questions save the end of the third; Why do we fall?<a name=273:12></a> Because it is part of the government of God to have us responsibly exercised, though not without grace sufficient for us and strength made perfect in weakness.<a name=273:13></a> But if we forget our weakness and dependence, we forget the grace too, and are in the way of a fall: see Peter's case, and the Lord did not ask he might not be sifted; he wanted it.<a name=273:14></a> The evil is not in the fall, really grievous as that is, but in the state it manifests.<a name=273:15></a> God may allow it that we may learn this.<a name=273:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Washing the feet is in connection with the advocacy -- we have dirtied them.<a name=273:17></a> "Save," in Hebrews 7: 25, is securing across the difficulties and dangers on to the end, as "if the righteous scarcely [ movli", with difficulty, across what brings ruin if [we are] not kept, as Noah, Lot] be saved.<a name=273:18></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Able to succour," as in chapter 2: 18, refers not to strength, though of course it must be there, but experimental knowledge of the opposition, difficulties, trials, which are on the road, so that He could understand, be touched with them.<a name=273:19></a> The priest does represent us, "appear in the presence of God for us," but that is before God, but He also obtains for us all needed grace and help, as regards the way down here.<a name=273:20></a> And learning our dependence, and to trust in God's faithfulness is a great thing; man would be independent, and has to learn his relationship to God, or rather know himself and God in it.<a name=273:21></a> This has its importance as well as being perfectly accepted.<a name=273:22></a>

When it says in Hebrews 7: 25 "he is able to save them to the uttermost," what is the sense in which the word save is used there?

		[To the same.<a name=274:1></a>] F Kingscote, I apprehend that both "the righteous" and "propitiation" (1 John 2: 1, 2) intimate to us the double character of perfectness actual state, and work of Christ, as the basis on which advocacy is carried on to restore the soul.<a name=274:2></a> If any man sin, there is an unchangeable and accepted righteousness in Christ, and a perfect work which has been presented to God for our sins, and indeed in view of the whole world.<a name=274:3></a> So that neither the ground of our acceptance nor the putting away of our sins are in question for our access to God.<a name=274:4></a> It is a question of restoring, not of accepting the soul both according to God's glory.<a name=274:5></a> Our place and cleanness for it are that in respect of which, and according to which, advocacy is carried on, and that positively and negatively.<a name=274:6></a>

		"He" (chapter 1: 9) must, I think, apply to God here, from verse 5 dealing with God in His nature.<a name=274:7></a> But you will find God and Christ wonderfully put together as one object in this epistle.<a name=274:8></a> See chapter 2: 23 -- 3: 3, and other passages.<a name=274:9></a> It is abstract, as all these passages, and applies to saint and sinner.<a name=274:10></a> There is a difference between God's forgiveness in the sense of non imputation according to Romans 4, and governmental forgiveness for us the Father's.<a name=274:11></a> Matthew 6: 14, 15, as referring abstractedly to a state of soul might apply to both.<a name=274:12></a> But the difference is very real, because justifying forgiveness (unknown in the Old Testament) is complete once and for ever, as Hebrews 9, 10 -- "no more conscience of sins"; whereas fatherly forgiveness one may daily need.<a name=274:13></a> We are not exactly called to seek it, but to confess our sins and we get it.<a name=274:14></a> But confession applies to our starting point also.<a name=274:15></a>

		-- - The first principle commonly stated is that of obedience.<a name=276:1></a> My answer to this is an absolute denial of obedience to ordinances in Christianity.<a name=276:2></a> It is a mischievous anti-christian principle, called "subject to ordinances," and deteriorates the whole character of a person's Christianity.<a name=276:3></a> As regards baptism in particular, it is perfectly certain that according to scripture it is not a matter of obedience.<a name=276:4></a> The proof is this; when the eunuch of Candace comes to water he asks, "What does hinder me to be baptised?<a name=276:5></a>" an expression, which if it were obedience, could have no place.<a name=276:6></a> Further, the obedience of a heathen or a Jew to a christian precept when not yet within, not yet admitted among Christians, is an absurdity contrary to the whole nature and principle of Christianity.<a name=276:7></a> Another case shews evidently that the notion of obedience is foreign to baptism.<a name=276:8></a> Peter says, "Can any man forbid water .<a name=276:9></a>.<a name=276:10></a>.<a name=276:11></a> which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?<a name=276:12></a>" Both these cases prove that it was a privilege desired or conferred, and not an act of obedience admission amongst Christians, the act of the baptiser on behalf of the assembly, not of the baptised.<a name=276:13></a> The truth is there is no command of Christ to <i>be</i> baptised -- there was <i>to</i> baptise, and it could not be otherwise.<a name=276:14></a> Christ could not as to Christianity give a command to those without.<a name=276:15></a> If the man is within it is by baptism, so that there can be no command to be baptised.<a name=276:16></a> The importance of this is that it shews that the baptist system falsifies the whole nature of baptism.<a name=276:17></a> Hence the apostles were not baptised.<a name=276:18></a> They the twelve, not Paul were sent to baptise, to admit into God's house.<a name=276:19></a> They could not be admitted.<a name=276:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I am aware that Baptists plead John's baptism, but this is too gross a confession for me to dwell on it, because John's baptism had no reference to death and resurrection nay, was the opposite to it, for it proposed to receive Christ, and, as far as it went, that He should not therefore die at all.<a name=276:21></a> Of course in fact this was impossible, but then those who had received this baptism were as Christians baptised over again.<a name=276:22></a> (Cf.<a name=276:23></a> Acts 19)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next principle asserted by those who insist on re baptising, is that baptism is the public confession that a man is already dead and risen again in Christ.<a name=276:24></a> This is entirely contrary also to scripture.<a name=276:25></a> Baptism is the doing the thing in sign, the declaration that it is <i>not yet</i> done, as far as man has to say it, or make confession, not that <i>it is</i>.<a name=276:26></a> "Arise," says Ananias, "and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord"; not to be baptised in testimony that thy sins <i>are</i> washed away.<a name=276:27></a> Again "Buried with him in baptism.<a name=276:28></a>" (Colossians 2.<a name=276:29></a>) "So many of us as were baptised unto Jesus Christ were baptised unto his death.<a name=276:30></a>" And so in every case.<a name=276:31></a> "As many of you as have been baptised unto Christ have put on Christ.<a name=276:32></a>" They were not baptised because they had already done it.<a name=276:33></a> None but those who are in principle Roman Catholics suppose that the work is done in it, but it is the sign of dying and rising again -- not of being dead and risen.<a name=276:34></a> No sacrament is a sign or profession of what is done, but of the doing of it.<a name=276:35></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This leads me to another point -- what baptism is to the being members of Christ's body.<a name=276:36></a> This is another unscriptural fallacy.<a name=276:37></a> Baptism has, even as a sign, nothing to do with the unity of the body.<a name=276:38></a> "By one Spirit are we all baptised into one body" -- not by water.<a name=276:39></a> The baptism of the Spirit is the seal of faith, as scripture repeatedly declares.<a name=276:40></a> "In whom after that ye believed ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise.<a name=276:41></a>" And if this was given, as in the case of Cornelius, they were baptised afterwards to be received amongst Christians.<a name=276:42></a> Baptism as a sign does not go beyond death and resurrection, and hence is individual.<a name=276:43></a> The church does not die has nothing to do with it: it is taken out of death in Christ, and united to a Head in heaven by the Holy Ghost; but for this Christ must be ascended there.<a name=276:44></a> He sends down the Holy Ghost and forms the church.<a name=276:45></a> (See the end of Ephesians 1) Of this unity the Lord's supper is the sign, not Baptism.<a name=276:46></a> We are all one body, "for we are all partakers of that one loaf.<a name=276:47></a>" But here again it is not a sign that we have eaten His flesh and drunk His blood.<a name=276:48></a> We do so in figure, as we are one body inasmuch as we partake.<a name=276:49></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But baptism presents the doctrine that I, a living sinner, die to sin, and arise again to be accepted in Christ's name, as alive unto God in the power of His resurrection, of that operation of God that raised Him from the dead, that this is the only way to be received before God.<a name=276:50></a> Hence by it we are received into the assembly on earth -- the house builded on earth for a habitation of God -- not into the body.<a name=276:51></a> In this we are looked at in scripture as seated in heavenly places in Him the Head.<a name=276:52></a> Hence Paul who was sent a minister of the church to complete the word of God was not sent to baptise.<a name=276:53></a> He accepted of course baptism as already established in the church of God, as (some Quakers excepted) I suppose every Christian does; but he had a special revelation as to the Lord's supper which is directly connected as a sign with the unity of the body.<a name=276:54></a> The twelve who, though the church existed, had not this mission, but had been sent forth by Christ in connection with the kingdom -- though subsequently as we know empowered by the Holy Ghost after the ascension of Christ, and that the church was formed by His descent -- were sent to baptise, but before the ascension though after the resurrection, and continued to receive of course into the outward public body on earth by baptism, with no examination however as to the reality of faith.<a name=276:55></a> But men were openly received out of heathenism or Judaism among Christians, so that it became a public profession.<a name=276:56></a> But this mission was not a mission for believers' baptism as it is called.<a name=276:57></a> They were sent to disciple all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.<a name=276:58></a>

		I am aware that it is said, But is it not said in Mark, "He that believeth and is baptised"?<a name=276:59></a> -- I know it is, and something more, "<i>shall be saved</i>.<a name=276:60></a>" Now I do not in the least accuse Baptists of any want of honesty in suppressing this, which gives its whole sense and character to the phrase, but I do say that it does shew that their views of baptism obscure entirely their perception of the force of scripture.<a name=276:61></a> Why do they not quote it all?<a name=276:62></a> Do they deny that I, or other believers who are not re-baptised according to their ideas, are saved?<a name=276:63></a> They dare not, nor do they desire to say so, but then why do they quote the passage?<a name=276:64></a> They cannot use it because of their views of baptism.<a name=276:65></a> To say that a man's obedience is to be added to his faith for salvation, is, save for a few extreme persons, too monstrous to be received.<a name=276:66></a> Whereas supposing, as it has happened to me, a Jew or a heathen is really convinced that Jesus is the Christ, and feels his own sins even, but says, 'My mother is a pious Jewess; it would kill her if I were to be baptised,' I say to him, I cannot recognise you as saved.<a name=276:67></a> It is not a poor obedience to an ordinance when already a Christian which is in question here, but a shrinking from being one.<a name=276:68></a>

		It is in this sense of saving that baptism is referred to in Peter, which, though the expression be obscure, is clear enough as to the point we are upon "the like figure whereunto baptism doth now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience towards God) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ" not the form of washing, of course: it must be real.<a name=276:69></a> It is a matter of a good conscience by the resurrection of Christ, but baptism is the sign of this, of dying and rising again in Him, so as to be on this ground before God.<a name=276:70></a> Can obedience to an ordinance save us, even in figure?<a name=276:71></a> We are before God on the ground of death and resurrection when baptised, and received into the house to be brought up and educated in divine life.<a name=276:72></a> Hence Christendom, and this is to me a very serious point, is judged as Christendom, and is in point of fact, till God finally judges it, the place of the habitation of the Holy Ghost.<a name=276:73></a> It is said, "But if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming .<a name=276:74></a>.<a name=276:75></a>.<a name=276:76></a> the lord of that <i>servant</i>," etc.<a name=276:77></a> He stands on the same ground as to his responsibility as the one made ruler of all his goods is spoken of as the same servant.<a name=276:78></a> Baptism receives into the house.<a name=276:79></a> There was no other method of receiving into the house, and no one could be received but on the ground of Christ's death and resurrection.<a name=276:80></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We have seen the scriptures never speak of baptising believers, nor any one, because they are dead and risen again in baptism.<a name=276:81></a> The question then is, as it is receiving grace, not man's acts or obedience, is it the mind of scripture that children should be received or not?<a name=276:82></a> No flesh can be presented to God, or be received, but on the ground of death and resurrection: on that scripture is clear.<a name=276:83></a> This is in baptism.<a name=276:84></a> Is it then God's mind that they should be received into the house where the Holy Ghost is, to be brought up by Him in the nurture and admonition of the Lord; or left outside in the world, where the devil is prince and god?<a name=276:85></a> For there is this without and within, whatever confusion exists through man.<a name=276:86></a> Scripture is clear -- "Of such is the kingdom of heaven.<a name=276:87></a>" Men say this was being received by Christ on earth.<a name=276:88></a> The kingdom of heaven was only at hand, and was only set up when Christ left the earth.<a name=276:89></a> Further, the question arose, Is the Christian to put away his heathen wife and children as among the Jews, because that, profaning him, the children were profane?<a name=276:90></a> No: grace was at work, and the heathen was sanctified (not holy, no more than the Jew was profane; he was only profaned and the children profane), and the children of the heathen women among the Jews were not.<a name=276:91></a> They are to be received, and then as within to be brought up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, which while without they could not be.<a name=276:92></a> Hence they receive precepts: "Children, obey your parents, for this is well pleasing to the Lord.<a name=276:93></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Two things are added: What can the children do?<a name=276:94></a> and, What good does it do them?<a name=276:95></a> The children do nothing: grace acts towards them.<a name=276:96></a> No one is brought nigh by doing.<a name=276:97></a> Baptists may think so.<a name=276:98></a> Scripture speaks of grace.<a name=276:99></a> They are consecrated to Christ and brought to God, but as ordered with the sign of death and resurrection -- the more significant because they have not yet actually sinned.<a name=276:100></a> The good done to them is that they are brought within, into the house where the Holy Ghost dwells, to be brought up, etc.<a name=276:101></a> I admit there is no commandment to baptise infants, nor is there to baptise believers, and there is no commandment to be baptised at all.<a name=276:102></a> But the Baptist notion of baptism, and all that he grounds on it, is unscriptural.<a name=276:103></a> And the scripture will have infants received.<a name=276:104></a> They that receive them receive Christ, and of such is the kingdom of heaven, and the child of a believing parent is holy.<a name=276:105></a> I do not doubt for a moment that children dying are received as saved into heaven.<a name=276:106></a> (See Matthew 18.<a name=276:107></a>) It is monstrous to think they cannot be received by the church on earth.<a name=276:108></a> It is said, why not give them the Lord's supper?<a name=276:109></a> Because that is the symbol of the unity of the body, and they are not of that till baptised by the Holy Ghost.<a name=276:110></a>

		I can only give a sketch of the great principles which the word of God furnishes to my mind, and all on which the Baptist views are founded seem to me to be contradicted by it; and the truth of what the great house is shews the mischievous character of it, as well as the way in which individuals are directed to ordinances from Christ, and the confusion which diverts from true separation or godliness within to the reception out of Judaism or heathenism without.<a name=276:111></a> In this point of view it seems to me practically deplorable.<a name=276:112></a>

		-- - The subject you refer to is one on which I so far unwillingly engage, that it is one which I feel is to be left entirely to individual consciences.<a name=280:1></a> If a person has never been baptised, clearly he ought to be; if he has, he cannot be again.<a name=280:2></a> The mere testimony save as any honest sacrifice of self, in which sense it may be accompanied with felt blessing is to me null, because, were I to be baptised tomorrow, no one would say I had become a <i>Christian</i>; they would merely say I was become a Baptist, or, at least, as it is expressed, that I saw baptism.<a name=280:3></a> At the first, it was a further testimony that one put on Christ, and bowed to the grace of the gospel.<a name=280:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first place, I am quite clear that the whole system of Baptists is wrong in principle from beginning to end, and in their idea of the import of the act.<a name=280:5></a> They speak of <i>obedience</i>; now, obedience to ordinances is setting aside the whole spirit and character of the gospel and of Christianity itself.<a name=280:6></a> In all cases it is unscriptural.<a name=280:7></a> Baptism, moreover, is the act of him that baptises, not of him that is baptised.<a name=280:8></a> He is received by it; he bows to it as the appointed way of his reception by the church; and this is what is suited to Christianity, which is grace that seeks and admits into the place of blessing not the voluntary act of the person coming, though he is made willing: a voluntary act of obedience being the introduction of a sinner into grace, is contrary to the whole nature and spirit of Christianity, and christian thoughts in their fundamental character.<a name=280:9></a> Hence there is no command to be baptised, but to go and baptise; and this marked in a very signal manner, as the twelve apostles never were baptised with christian baptism (with John's only, which has nothing to do with the matter), because, being an act of admission, they were sent to admit.<a name=280:10></a> Had it been one of obedience to a command, surely they would have been the first to do it; and who was, then, to baptise them?<a name=280:11></a> This shews its real character most clearly.<a name=280:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The whole adult baptism view falls before my mind, as utterly unscriptural and ill-founded -- scripture, moreover, in practice, never speaking of a <i>testimony</i>, but of a <i>benefit</i> conferred: "What doth hinder me to be baptised?<a name=280:13></a>" ( the following verse, I apprehend, is not authentic scripture, though I doubt not in such a case very right, but not the then way of dealing, however), and "Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptised, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?<a name=280:14></a>" Hence the question as to children is entirely changed.<a name=280:15></a> It is a simple question of who is to be received.<a name=280:16></a> All the arguments from the mere incapacity of the infant, have no weight.<a name=280:17></a> It is a question of grace, and whether the infant is to be brought into the place where the Holy Ghost dwells, or left in the world where Satan governs.<a name=280:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But before I turn to this -- the one point with me -- I would notice another principle of Baptists which is wholly false that baptism is the expression of the state in which the individual already is.<a name=280:19></a> This, I apprehend, is wholly unscriptural.<a name=280:20></a> It is an external reception, it is true; but in its meaning, it is the <i>reception</i> or entrance, not the expression of a <i>previous one</i>.<a name=280:21></a> The believer is dead and risen with Christ; the reality of this is, of course, by living faith; but as to the further act, "as many of you as have been baptised unto Christ have put on Christ" not witnessed our having previously put Him on: we have been baptised (it is really <i>unto</i>, and so always) <i>into His death</i> not because we were there before: we are "buried with him by baptism into death" "<i>wherein</i>, also, we are risen with him.<a name=280:22></a>" Baptism signifies, undoubtedly, death and resurrection, but it is then and there, as to the meaning of the form, we die and rise again.<a name=280:23></a> We enter into the church by dying and rising again.<a name=280:24></a> We enter into the outward visible body by that ordinance, which signifies our dying and rising again.<a name=280:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, as to the reception of children, Matthew 18.<a name=280:26></a> seems to me to have great force.<a name=280:27></a> The question is, Are children to be received by Christ?<a name=280:28></a> Is the kingdom of such?<a name=280:29></a> I am aware that He is giving them as the pattern of our spirit, but there was an actual infant there of whom He was speaking; and if it were a saintly person, who was as humble as a child, there would be no sense in saying, "it was not the will of your Father that one of these little ones should perish, for their angels," etc.<a name=280:30></a> That is, it is the infant.<a name=280:31></a> This being, I think, clear, the passage becomes remarkable "Of such is the kingdom.<a name=280:32></a>" They are spoken of as in the way of perishing, but that they are not to be rejected, because, as the shepherd saves a lost sheep, Christ is come to save that which was lost.<a name=280:33></a> (Matthew 18: 11, 14.<a name=280:34></a>) I refer to this, as defining the character of the persons admissible into the kingdom.<a name=280:35></a> As to the manner of admission, all are agreed.<a name=280:36></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is something much more positive than this.<a name=280:37></a> If a Jew married a Gentile, the wife was to be sent away and the children were to be rejected as "unclean," and not admitted into the house of God by circumcision.<a name=280:38></a> This question arose when one parent was converted, and instead of the Jew being relatively profaned, though still a Jew, so that his child was unclean, the heathen or Jew was relatively sanctified, so that the child was holy -- not intrinsically, of course, but relatively, so that he would be received among the people -- "else were your children unclean, but now are they holy.<a name=280:39></a>" People have talked of their being legitimate, but this has nothing to do with it: the Jewish principle brought out in Nehemiah is perfectly clear.<a name=280:40></a> It is said, Why then not give them the Lord's supper?<a name=280:41></a> The Lord's supper is symbolic of the unity of the body, and it is by one Spirit we are baptised into one body hence, I apprehend, it is he who is made really partaker of the Holy Ghost who can be properly partaker of the Lord's supper.<a name=280:42></a> Now, I admit that there is no <i>command</i> for infants to be baptised: it would suppose a moral effect.<a name=280:43></a> But there is none for adults -- there is to the apostles, to go and baptise the nations they had brought into discipleship: and households are spoken of in scripture.<a name=280:44></a> We know it was the habit and thought of those sent.<a name=280:45></a> I am told that Christianity is the opposite of this in its nature.<a name=280:46></a> This is true as regards individual salvation.<a name=280:47></a> But I do not think introduction into "the house" the same thing as that.<a name=280:48></a> If one parent be converted, they are, it seems to me, entitled to that, and unjustly deprived of it, if it is refused to them.<a name=280:49></a> This thought was soon lost, and individual salvation connected with it and the new birth.<a name=280:50></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards Acts 2, I think the passage is of moment as confirming the habits of Jewish thinking for the Gentiles were in as those "afar off," by sovereign grace, as far as God called them.<a name=280:51></a> But it did inspire the hopes of the Jews, that their children would partake of the benefit, and such was their thought.<a name=280:52></a> It is true, they rejected, as a nation, this testimony of the Holy Ghost, but I do not think that the remnant who did receive it would have let go the privilege as regards admission to the house in which the Holy Ghost dwelt; the result would shew itself independent of ordinances, where the operation of the Holy Ghost was manifest, and the liberty and understanding He gives to members of the body there; then they would enjoy the privileges belonging to members and to the unity of the body, according to the intelligence of faith, brought up, meanwhile, in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, and the precepts of the house addressed to them in their place.<a name=280:53></a> When the call of the Gentiles came in a new shape with Paul, and the unity of the body was made the basis of his ministry, nothing was professedly changed, and he preached still the kingdom, and said to the Jews still, "unto you first"; but while having people and households baptised, he speaks less of it and attaches less importance to it: the making it a matter of <i>obedience</i> never crosses his thoughts.<a name=280:54></a> Such I believe to be the true scriptural history of this subject.<a name=280:55></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But if any one thinks that he ought to be baptised, or that he has not been, surely he ought, or he will have his conscience ill at ease about it, and that is evil, no matter what the subject is, only he would do well to search the mind of God first.<a name=280:56></a> <i>Obedience to an ordinance</i> is, I am satisfied, wrong; and there is no command for it in scripture.<a name=280:57></a> It is not the act of the baptised nor a public testimony.<a name=280:58></a> All this I believe to be most unscriptural, and in its principles unchristian, though often most honestly done.<a name=280:59></a>

		No one can read the statements of scripture and not see these statements of the Baptists are wholly contradicted by those of scripture.<a name=286:31></a> It remains, then, to inquire, who may be outwardly received into the public assembly of God on earth by men; God alone Himself in Christ being He who unites to the body.<a name=286:32></a> Now, when I turn to scripture, I find, when children were brought to Jesus (Matthew 19: 14), that His reply to His objecting disciples is, "Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.<a name=286:33></a>" Now, I am told that this was merely the gracious kindness of Jesus then, and does not refer to our receiving them now, or merely to personal gracious reception now.<a name=286:34></a> The answer is evident.<a name=286:35></a> The kingdom of heaven was not set up then, but only at hand.<a name=286:36></a> It is not, "I will build my church," but "the kingdom of heaven," the keys of which (not of the church) were committed to Peter -- and see the consequence.<a name=286:37></a> In Matthew 18 (and all these chapters from 16, the Lord is shewing the principles of what was coming in after His departure) we read, "Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones for I say unto you that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.<a name=286:38></a> <i>For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost</i>.<a name=286:39></a>" Mark that ground on which it is laid; was it only when He was on earth?<a name=286:40></a> Then note the parable.<a name=286:41></a> vers.<a name=286:42></a> 12, 13.<a name=286:43></a>) Even so it is not the will of my Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.<a name=286:44></a>" But we may not receive them.<a name=286:45></a> Though the Lord does not give the sign of this privilege by the death and resurrection of Christ (though He lays that privilege on the ground of His coming to save the lost), He tells me, "And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me.<a name=286:46></a>" How can I receive a sinner and the little child is a sinner in Christ's name, but on the ground of death and resurrection?<a name=286:47></a> A Baptist tells me I am to receive him to God as a heathen without the death and resurrection of Christ because they have perverted the sense of baptism.<a name=286:48></a> I receive him on the ground, "The Son of man is come to save that which was lost.<a name=286:49></a>" The kingdom of heaven being of such, am I not to receive him on it in Christ's name or if in His name, not by death and resurrection into the kingdom of heaven?<a name=286:50></a> But more, I am positively assured they are holy when one parent is a Christian (not intrinsically, it is the outward reception on earth which is before us), and the passage applies directly to the point in question.<a name=286:51></a> If a Jew married a heathen he had profaned himself, the wife was profaned, and so the children and wife were to be put away that was law.<a name=286:52></a> Grace came one parent was counted a believer, the other not: were they to separate as the Jews ought to have done?<a name=286:53></a> No!<a name=286:54></a> The unbelieving was sanctified as the Jew was profaned not holy more than the Jew was profane and the children were holy just as the Jew's children were profane.<a name=286:55></a> What was the consequence for the Jew's child?<a name=286:56></a> He could not be received into the outward privileges of Judaism by circumcision he was profane; the child of the Christian could it was holy.<a name=286:57></a> It was thus a definite decision on the point not upsetting the very nature of Christianity by giving a commandment contained in ordinances as Baptists would and do, but giving directions as to the principles on which we are to act.<a name=286:58></a>

		I am told that an immense system of evil is built up by it.<a name=286:59></a> In the first place, if the sanctity of the Lord's supper had been maintained, which is the unity of the body, and the place of discipline, this would not have been so; but, as far as the principle goes, the great house is contemplated in scripture, and does not cease till He judges it.<a name=286:60></a> It is His house in which the vessels to honour are.<a name=286:61></a> It is not the body, but it will be judged as His house, responsible as such.<a name=286:62></a> I receive, then, the children of a christian parent, all, if born <i>bon fide</i> and brought into the house where the Holy Spirit dwells, to bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.<a name=286:63></a> I receive them because Christ received them, and said that the kingdom of heaven, to be set up after His death, was of such, because they are holy.<a name=286:64></a> The precept, "Obey your parents <i>in the Lord</i>," could not be given them without.<a name=286:65></a> If it receive them <i>within</i>, baptism is appointed by the Lord for it: it is not the Lord's body; but they cannot be received but on the ground of Christ's death and resurrection.<a name=286:66></a> The Father, I know, does receive as such.<a name=286:67></a>

		-- - In reference to the subject about which you inquired of me, I have first to ask a question.<a name=289:1></a> I know that there are in Strasbourg Baptists who belong to a system well known in Switzerland, which, however, is so bad -- so morally bad -- that I should not think of considering this secondary subject with you, concerning which, I am, with my whole heart, ready to leave every conscience free.<a name=289:2></a> Now, it is very possible that these Mulhausen Baptists belong to the same system as the Strasbourgers: with people who hold such doctrines I should never speak about baptism.<a name=289:3></a> A brother, however, just now tells me that the Mulhausen Baptists do not belong to the Strasbourgers.<a name=289:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I confess I would rather treat on any other subject than this of baptism.<a name=289:5></a> The great evil of their system is, that they occupy themselves with ordinances instead of with the Lord, and one is obliged to do the same when speaking of it.<a name=289:6></a> The subject has been discussed in all its bearings amongst the brethren assembled here, among whom there were brethren who had allowed themselves to be baptised, and who had left the Baptists; and no doubt the falsity of their system has been made very evident, even for those who, in my opinion, do not see clearly.<a name=289:7></a> I can only touch on the main points.<a name=289:8></a> The first is, that the Baptists' system places Christendom outside the responsibility of Christianity as not forming part thereof: they consider them only as Gentiles who have not been received through baptism, though those who form Christendom are according to them, not a part of the christian system, of which the true Christians form a part.<a name=289:9></a> This is of great importance, because thereby the position of Christendom, and the house, involving responsibility, are destroyed.<a name=289:10></a> In a great house there are vessels to honour and dishonour: they are both in the same great house.<a name=289:11></a> To this it will be replied, Am I then not called upon to leave it?<a name=289:12></a> It is impossible, for one has been received into it by baptism, and through the christian belief.<a name=289:13></a> I am not called to leave it, but to separate from the vessels of dishonour.<a name=289:14></a> From this point of view, Baptists entirely falsify the position of the Christians in the latter days; moreover, their principle makes baptism the bond of the unity of the body, and through this they are Baptists -- that makes them Baptists -- but this very principle is quite false, and contrary to scripture.<a name=289:15></a> The act of baptism is not the reception into the body of Christ; one may have been baptised a thousand times, and yet not be of this body.<a name=289:16></a> It (baptism) is not even the symbol of it.<a name=289:17></a> That which makes us members of the body of Christ is the baptism of the Holy Ghost: we are, through one Spirit, all baptised into one body.<a name=289:18></a> Of the body, the Lord's supper is the symbol, and the participation of it the outward confession of unity: for as it is one bread, so we, being many, are one body, for we are all partakers of that one bread (loaf).<a name=289:19></a> Baptism is the sign of death and resurrection (or, rather, in the participation of it); he, therefore, who rests the oneness of the body on baptism, or intends through baptism to lead into the body of Christ, is quite wrong, and this is an important point.<a name=289:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, again, they take obedience as a basis, and subject us to an ordinance as duty of obedience.<a name=289:21></a> The principle of being required to obey an ordinance Christianity rejects, because it makes an act of the outer man a condition for entering into the enjoyment of the privileges of grace .<a name=289:22></a>.<a name=289:23></a>.<a name=289:24></a> .<a name=289:25></a> Baptism is a privilege granted, which admits into the number of the faithful and into the great house.<a name=289:26></a> According to the Baptists' principle the apostles ought not to have partaken of the Lord's supper, for they had not been baptised; nor could they have been, for there was no one to baptise them.<a name=289:27></a> That would evidently be an absurdity, but according to the Baptists' system, such an inference would be necessary.<a name=289:28></a> Again, they pretend the sacraments to be signs and seals of things received -- a principle which is false.<a name=289:29></a> I do not partake of the Lord's supper as a sign that I have eaten Christ, but I eat Him there -- I drink there His blood in the sign.<a name=289:30></a> Moreover, the word is very precise -- one is buried into death through baptism; so that their doctrine in reference to these precepts is quite false.<a name=289:31></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Lastly -- and this is the worst -- there is the way in which they occupy souls with a legal prescription of obedience, and engage their attention with an ordinance, instead of occupying them with Christ, which gives the soul a false direction as regards its whole state.<a name=289:32></a> It then (without knowing it) accepts a principle which breaks down Christianity in its foundation, like him who keeps days, but in a more serious case, because they make the oneness of the body to depend on it.<a name=289:33></a> St.<a name=289:34></a> Paul was not sent to baptise.<a name=289:35></a> I, for my part, feel convinced that the commission to the twelve was "to make disciples of all nations," not a body of elect converts.<a name=289:36></a> Now, since this has been done (be it right or wrong), and they have been baptised, they (the Baptists) will not acknowledge it, and commence to re baptise, or, rather, encourage Christians to do so, because they despise what was done.<a name=289:37></a> The difficulty now lies in this, that the Baptists who are sunk into subjection to ordinances necessarily conceal from themselves the ways of God often, no doubt, dear children of God, to whom I, with my whole heart, allow liberty of conscience, as to him who only wants to eat herbs; but really to make ignorance and conformity to law the condition of the oneness of the body is a little too strong!<a name=289:38></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the condition in which the church is, I easily yield to it, and one can only hope to protect souls through the details and precise statements of the word of God, leaving the conscience perfectly free; but a religious union in the so called body of Christ (of the Baptists) which would exclude the apostles is a little too absurd!<a name=289:39></a>

		DEAR BROTHER, -- I must repeat what I said to you, that I have not the most distant wish to persuade any one on the subject of baptism.<a name=291:1></a> I believe it is a rite established at the beginning; but I was not sent to baptise, nor was Paul.<a name=291:2></a> (1 Corinthians 1: 17.<a name=291:3></a>) It was not abrogated.<a name=291:4></a> The circumstances of my own baptism, though done <i>bon fide</i>, and in the main with right intentions, were not such as I should wish, but I do not think it can be repeated.<a name=291:5></a> And while Paul gets a special revelation as to the Lord's supper (1 Corinthians 11: 23, 26), though already long instituted and in use (he being the minister of the church and the teacher of the unity of the body), he is not sent to baptise, which was the introduction into the outer circle of public position as a Christian.<a name=291:6></a> What is special to brethren, so called (for the foundation of salvation, even if made clearer, must in itself be the same everywhere, where it is true), is the presence of the Holy Ghost forming the unity of the body down here, and gathering saints into this unity out of the great baptised mass.<a name=291:7></a> If any such have never been baptised, I apprehend they ought to be, as Quakers, grown up Baptists children, etc.<a name=291:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I see in baptism is admission into the professing body or house.<a name=291:9></a> It has nothing to do with the body of Christ; hence, if one had received the Holy Ghost, as Cornelius, he had to be professedly introduced.<a name=291:10></a> (Acts 10: 46, 48.<a name=291:11></a>) God not only converts souls, giving eternal life, but has established a dwelling place consequent on redemption, where His blessings are.<a name=291:12></a> So with Israel.<a name=291:13></a> He came and dwelt there.<a name=291:14></a> (Exodus 29: 45, 46.<a name=291:15></a>) So "what advantage hath the Jews?<a name=291:16></a> Much every way.<a name=291:17></a>" He had the law and the covenants and the promises, and even Christ, as concerning the flesh.<a name=291:18></a> Not that all were Israel which were of Israel, but these blessings were distinctively theirs (Romans 9: 1-6, not amongst the heathen.<a name=291:19></a> So now, the Holy Ghost and all other christian blessings are found within the christian calling not amongst heathens, not amongst Jews, not amongst Mahometans.<a name=291:20></a> The gospel may be carried to them, but christian blessings are not among them as such; they are among Christians: the basis of the truth is there.<a name=291:21></a> The state of things may be awfully corrupted, and is so, but till God judges it (like Judaism) it remains the place where His blessings are found.<a name=291:22></a> Baptism is the formal admission into this -- it is christening.<a name=291:23></a> The person is received outwardly into the habitation of God, as set up in this world.<a name=291:24></a> (Ephesians 2: 22; 1 Timothy 3: 15)

		It is the act of the <i>baptiser</i>, not of the <i>baptised</i>.<a name=291:25></a> The latter cannot do it for himself, he is outside, and cannot receive himself in.<a name=291:26></a> So it is written, "He commanded them to be baptised in the name of the Lord.<a name=291:27></a>" (Acts 10: 48.<a name=291:28></a>) Hence there is no trace of the one hundred and twenty being baptised at all.<a name=291:29></a> Where was the place they were to be received into?<a name=291:30></a> or who was to do it?<a name=291:31></a> They were made the place, and in this case the body too, by the descent of the Holy Ghost.<a name=291:32></a> (Acts 2: 1-4.<a name=291:33></a>) It is not obedience; first, like the hundred and twenty, man could not obey; he cannot baptise himself: but more, Peter says, "Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptised, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?<a name=291:34></a>" and commanded them to be baptised.<a name=291:35></a> <i>It was a privilege conferred</i>.<a name=291:36></a> Who could refuse to receive them, seeing God had put this seal upon them So with the Ethiopian "here is water; what doth <i>hinder</i> me to be baptised.<a name=291:37></a>" You are aware probably that the verse following -- that is, Acts 8: 37 -- is not genuine, and has been foisted in, though long ago, by those who thought confession of faith needed.<a name=291:38></a> No such confession, or examination if it was with all the heart, was ever made in the apostolic times.<a name=291:39></a> The Lord did take care it should be pure at first added such as should be saved (Acts 2: 47), sealing them with the Holy Ghost.<a name=291:40></a> Nor is baptism the sign of what we have received.<a name=291:41></a> People are baptised to something, not because of their having it to (not into) Christ's death, to Moses, to John's baptism, buried to death, to (it is the same word) the remission of sins.<a name=291:42></a> Hence it is always, "Arise, and be baptised, and wash away thy sins" (Acts 22: 16), not because the sins have been: to Christ's death, not because they have died: "The like figure whereunto baptism doth also now save us .<a name=291:43></a>.<a name=291:44></a>.<a name=291:45></a> by the resurrection of Jesus Christ.<a name=291:46></a>" (1 Peter 3: 21) Hence, when one entered believingly, he got the blessing, as far as forgiveness went, administratively here below, and was thereupon sealed by the Holy Ghost.<a name=291:47></a> (Acts 2.<a name=291:48></a>) It is not a testimony to others (though it may turn to such) as the case of the Ethiopian shews, nor is it ever spoken of as such.<a name=291:49></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When I come to the history, it is very peculiar, as if God had meant to make us feel we were in the last days in a corrupt Christendom, not founding it.<a name=291:50></a> The only commission to baptise is to go and discipline the Gentiles (the command from Galilee with the remnant, not from the ascended Christ), baptising them, etc.<a name=291:51></a> There was no command to baptise the Jews nor known believers.<a name=291:52></a> I do not doubt they were baptised, and accept it as an apostolic fact.<a name=291:53></a> But this commission was never carried out.<a name=291:54></a> In Galatians 2, Paul having been expressly called and sent to the Gentiles (verse 7), "to whom now I send thee" (Acts 26: 17), the apostles at Jerusalem agree that he should take up this mission, and they go to the Jews, and so it was.<a name=291:55></a> They had stayed at Jerusalem when the assembly was scattered (Matthew 10: 23), whether rightly I do not say, only God took care that unity should be preserved by Cornelius, and Acts 15.<a name=291:56></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The subject of baptism is death, as Romans 6 shews -- that is, Christ's death and partially resurrection in Colossians 2 perhaps, but other words are added there.<a name=291:57></a> The person enters into the Christian circle (analogous to Israel) by it (see 1 Corinthians 10) where the sacramental position is carefully distinguished from personal safety.<a name=291:58></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards children, my object is not to argue, but to shew the nature of baptism.<a name=291:59></a> I believe that 1 Corinthians 7: 14 especially authorises it, not to speak of Mark 10: 14.<a name=291:60></a> (compare Matthew 18 and Ephesians 6: 1.<a name=291:61></a>) The boundaries of the assembly of God and the world have been so broken down and both intermingled, that the fact of the Holy Ghost being in the assembly (not in the individual here), and Satan in the world is eclipsed by the state of things; but it was not so at the beginning, and the word of God abides.<a name=291:62></a> The question as to children is not are they converted, but are they to be left in the devil's dominion, or brought where the Holy Ghost dwells, to be brought up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord?<a name=291:63></a> But assuming it to be done <i>bon fide</i>, done according to the "one faith," I should leave every person to his own conscience.<a name=291:64></a> It is sometimes argued, Why not give them the Lord's supper too?<a name=291:65></a> The answer is simple, It is the sign of the unity of the body, and it is by one Spirit we are baptised into that.<a name=291:66></a> (1 Cor 12: 13.<a name=291:67></a>) The Lord's supper gives the sign of that unity, as spoken of in Ephesians 4: 4, as baptism of outward position in Ephesians 4: 5
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The root of the question as to baptism is, Is it the act of the baptised individually, or reception into the public assembly On this point scripture leaves no doubt on my mind.<a name=291:68></a> And, is there (besides individual conversion) a place or system which God has set up on earth where He dwells, and where His blessings are placed which He set up right at first, and has been utterly corrupted, but which has to be owned in its responsibility and character until God judges it just as the Lord called the temple His Father's house, though it had been made a den of thieves.<a name=291:69></a> (Matthew 21: 12, 13.<a name=291:70></a>)

		To a spiritually intelligent mind, the word of God carries an authority beyond all cavils; and a poor, unintelligent man would pass over what is contrary to the mind generated by it, as evidently false, or as unable to understand it, so that he escapes what is false inserted by men in it.<a name=295:52></a> They shall be all taught of God; and when the conscience is reached, and the will subject, and therefore the mind silent, we have the peace which certainty gives (and uncertainty as to what is all important is misery), and blessed growth in what God Himself has revealed for divine blessing and joy.<a name=295:53></a> I do not receive the Bible, that is, a revelation of God from the hands of men.<a name=295:54></a> I receive paper and ink.<a name=295:55></a> The revelation I receive from God directly -- "They shall be all taught of God.<a name=295:56></a>" The revelation is a divinely wrought conviction, and, I repeat, <i>in the conscience</i>.<a name=295:57></a> I know I have done what is wrong: your friend knows it of himself; he knows he is responsible to God.<a name=295:58></a> Where is what meets it?<a name=295:59></a> The Holy Ghost always produces a want when He acts answers the want in Christ revealed in the word, but produces one always.<a name=295:60></a> This brought Nicodemus by night, when his mind was exactly on the same ground as the others, who got nothing.<a name=295:61></a> <i>There</i> was all the difference: thus it always is.<a name=295:62></a>

		[Mr Witherby] [DEAR BROTHER, I should not say, 'is put away from the table'<a href="#299:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> but 'is no longer in communion with us'; he has left you, and you cannot put him away.<a name=299:20></a> But I should not in the least avoid saying that we meet around the Lord's table.<a name=299:21></a> I could not own sectarian tables as the Lord's table with the light I have; but saints who may honestly think us in disorder go to it as such, and I do not doubt enjoy individual communion with the Lord.<a name=299:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The "Lord's table" is used simply as a title of Christ in contrast with devils.<a name=299:23></a> In itself a title of authority, it has nothing whatever to do with communion: where communion is spoken of it is not used, or, that I am aware of, is Lord of an assembly a scriptural idea.<a name=299:24></a> He is either Lord absolutely, or of individual servants.<a name=299:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To call tables of Nationals, or sects, tables of devils is a simple absurdity, in defiance of plain language of scripture.<a name=299:26></a> I could not go to them; but what "devils" means is distinctly stated in scripture, and means nothing but the gods of the heathen, and is a reference to Deuteronomy 32: 17, "they offered to devils, and not to God": to refer this to Baptists or Independents is a gross abuse.<a name=299:27></a> The apostle speaks of communion with devils (in idol temples) and heathen sacrifices and nothing else, and to apply this to wrong ecclesiastical principles, where the Lord is owned as the only object, is trifling with scripture and nonsense in itself.<a name=299:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Saying that all professing Christians are of the church of God may be questioned.<a name=299:29></a> The Church of God is employed in two senses or better, two things are spoken of the assembly one, that it is the body of Christ; of this all professors were not, so soon as false brethren crept in it is also the habitation of God through the Spirit, the house of the living God, and in this hay, wood and stubble may be built in, and professors are of or in the house.<a name=299:30></a> It is not true if we speak of the body, though they take the place; it is true if we speak of the house.<a name=299:31></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the fifth question, I do not doubt that a Christian holding he stands for acceptance in Christ's imputed righteousness may be quite sound as to the nature of Christ.<a name=299:32></a> I have known most true and beloved saints who were muddy on the point though I think they lose a great deal.<a name=299:33></a> We must not impute even true consequences of a doctrine to the persons who hold it -- it may be if they saw the consequences they would give it up; we may use them to shew the doctrine false, seeing it leads to such.<a name=299:34></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to "communion of the body of Christ," in verse 16 it is the body of the Lord, as in the same verse the blood, but the other is closely connected with it.<a name=299:35></a> What the apostle is speaking of is that the priests in eating of the altar were identified with it the heathen, of what was offered there, identified with the idol had koinwniva, not merely mevtoco", nor partook, but were morally completely associated with it, hence with demons: so Christians with Christ.<a name=299:36></a> But then if all were associated with the body of Christ, they were with one another, and only one body themselves.<a name=299:37></a> It was included in it, but verse 16 refers expressly to the body of Christ; verse 17 shews the other, our unity in one body, to be included in it.<a name=299:38></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have only to add, dear brother, have patience and grace; a servant of the Lord must not strive.<a name=299:39></a> I know by my own experience how difficult it is.<a name=299:40></a> Without the most distant thought of an unkind feeling, we are not always gentle to all men.<a name=299:41></a> We have just been over all this ground here, and have had it out pretty (perhaps I might say, very) clear, and in full and happy unity.<a name=299:42></a> May it be so with you too.<a name=299:43></a> Our meeting has gone on, I trust, with real comfort in the Lord's presence most of the Irish labourers, and a few English, with the local brethren in the evening, but no sisters and no lectures; all which, I feel, is much more to the purpose.<a name=299:44></a> I have, of course, little time at such a moment, and a heavy correspondence too, but I believe I have answered all your questions.<a name=299:45></a> You should read the passage in 1 Corinthians 10.<a name=299:46></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#299:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>'Is it well or scriptural to say that we put away from the Lord's table? For example, "So and so has joined the Baptists, and is put away from the Lord's table." Does such a mode of expression give sufficient place to the worship of other Christians in this day of brokenness, or would it be time-serving to avoid saying, the Table around which we meet is the only Lord's table?' <p>'Is the name of "Lord" that of authority only, or can it be used in reference to communion? And does the Lord's table imply communion, or does it mean the Table over which the Lord's authority is set?' <p>'Could it be said that other christian tables are the tables of devils, or has the passage in 1 Corinthians 10. no reference to Christendom as it now is?' <p>'Is it right to say that all professing Christians are of the church of God (not the body)?' <p>'Could a Christian holding that he stands for acceptance before God in Christ's imputed righteousness, be orthodox as to the nature of Christ's Person, or must he necessarily hold the consequences of such doctrine, so far as they relate to Christ being under divine wrath throughout His life on earth?' <p>'When it says "communion of the body of Christ," is the body of the Lord spoken of, or is the corporate body of believers intended?'

		J James, As to your question, it was up in -- at the Tuesday labourers' meeting, and there was a unanimous feeling in it as to the substance of the matter.<a name=301:1></a> Technically perhaps you cannot put a person out who has withdrawn, but this is a mere question of the form of words: he ought to be out by the judgment of the assembly as well as by his own act.<a name=301:2></a> In the -- case they had excommunicated him after his withdrawal.<a name=301:3></a> I might have said, Such a person having withdrawn under a charge of sin (where investigation was refused by him and the guilt was not proved) is out of communion till the matter be cleared up before God.<a name=301:4></a> If, as in this case, guardedness was not needed, as the guilt was proved, it needed but to say, Such an one having withdrawn when guilty of sin clearly proved, is out of communion, and can only be restored on fresh repentance.<a name=301:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is absolutely necessary in such a case that the judgment of the assembly should be clearly pronounced, otherwise the assembly has not judged known sin to the Lord's dishonour.<a name=301:6></a> Nor is that all; the person might march in without the assembly's having any right to refuse him, as he marched out.<a name=301:7></a> The form of words is not to me material.<a name=301:8></a> What is essential to me is that he should be out by the judgment of the assembly as well as by his own act.<a name=301:9></a> Or the assembly is passing over sin known in Its bosom.<a name=301:10></a> I have known many cases where a person being charged with sin has declined coming any more, but it is always dealt with.<a name=301:11></a> Even if they deliberately withdrew to join other churches, it has been noticed after visiting, etc.<a name=301:12></a>, so that it was known to be deliberate.<a name=301:13></a> There was a time in -- of a kind of revival-working when people did not come for a long while and it was unnoticed, but it was felt (and it was only through neglect and not being noticed in the immense number) -- but it was felt that this could not be.<a name=301:14></a> They had never formally withdrawn.<a name=301:15></a>

		In this case it was worse, because he withdrew on purpose to hide it, though in vain.<a name=301:16></a> Only he had taken counsel of others, so that modifies his act -- but why did he do so?<a name=301:17></a> I do not see the wrong of this in the first instance, save that in these cases they are bound to see after the person, know why, and if it is deliberate, and even then give it out.<a name=301:18></a> Otherwise he might sin and run riot, and come back, having never been put out why should he not?<a name=301:19></a> Had this been done, it would only have remained to say that it was alas!<a name=301:20></a> discovered it was by occasion of positive sin, which confirmed the judgment that he was outside .<a name=301:21></a>.<a name=301:22></a>.<a name=301:23></a> .<a name=301:24></a>

		My Dear G Glenny, -- One thing that you relate gave me much to think of, as indeed it has been a subject of thought pretty often for a long while, nor am I sure that I have the Lord's mind clear upon it.<a name=305:1></a> I think evangelising the greatest privilege of any in respect of gifts, though I am not an evangelist, only when I can, do the work of one as well as I can.<a name=305:2></a> That is not my difficulty, but what you say: that the evangelisation has enfeebled the teaching the saints.<a name=305:3></a> The gifts are clearly distinct, but I do not see that one should enfeeble the other.<a name=305:4></a> Paul assuredly evangelised, and as surely taught, and taught in evangelising: witness the Thessalonians: and if he did not look for, he certainly found, present fruit.<a name=305:5></a> He distinguishes being a minister of the gospel and a minister of the church, to fulfil (complete) the word of God.<a name=305:6></a> This is not in the Thessalonians: all is personal, not corporate.<a name=305:7></a> We must be with God for each, as called of Him to it; and then I do not see why power should not be for both.<a name=305:8></a> But a certain salvationism, instead of Christianity, I think has to say to it, which God may bless, but which carries its effect with it.<a name=305:9></a> Few carry in their mind, "I endure all things for the elect's sake.<a name=305:10></a>" It is a general idea that God is love, and would have all men to be saved, which is blessedly true; but thus it ends in being saved, man's safety.<a name=305:11></a> There is no purpose of God in it, no glory of Christ -- all called upon to bow to and own Him.<a name=305:12></a> Hence as to the preacher's state of mind, when he has got the person saved, and this confessed, he is content, goes no further: God's interest in His own is lost, which leads on to building them up.<a name=305:13></a> If we were with God about them, the heart would soon be drawn out in testimony to them.<a name=305:14></a> There is another thing -- glory to Christ in His church.<a name=305:15></a> This I confess greatly absorbs my spirit, though I be a poor hand for this work too: but this leads us to prayer for saints, so also to testimony to them.<a name=305:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The evil is not earnest devotedness to evangelising -- it is itself the way of blessing to an assembly, or rather God's working in one by His presence builds up the other -- it is being absorbed by it.<a name=305:17></a> But this affects the evangelising itself; there is less of Christ in it, more of man's importance, and when pursued in a revival way, more of delusive work; it never gives a solid foundation to build upon.<a name=305:18></a> I should be most loath to weaken evangelisation: I believe God is blessing it, specially for gathering out in these last days, and it is healthful for an assembly that their hearts are engaged in it.<a name=305:19></a> At the very beginning it characterised brethren, and I trust still does, though it be more common now on all hands.<a name=305:20></a> The love exercised in it binds also saints together.<a name=305:21></a> But God is in a great professing body, awakening them to their state, and this has its importance also: the cry that awoke the virgins was not the gospel, ordinarily so called.<a name=305:22></a> Finally, the hand cannot say to the foot I have no need of you.<a name=305:23></a> I do not reject the joy of counting converts, but we must not lean upon it: "When ye shall have done all these things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants; we have done that which was our duty to do.<a name=305:24></a>" The bond of service to Christ is kept up, and that is of great importance.<a name=305:25></a> It is not referring the effect to our work but our work and heart to Him.<a name=305:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am sure if we were near Christ we should do both well, assuming of course that Christ has called us to it.<a name=305:27></a> Do not be content to put one in place of the other, but see what Christ means by it.<a name=305:28></a> Be with Christ about the saints when you have to say to them.<a name=305:29></a> Be with Christ as to both, and then see what is the result.<a name=305:30></a> The question in general has very long pressed upon me in connection with the spiritual activities of the day.<a name=305:31></a> I have never been allowed to see much fruit, and have been more blessed in bringing to peace than in awakening.<a name=305:32></a> There is One, thank God, who is above all, and does all: let us look to Him.<a name=305:33></a> The Lord be abundantly with you, and guide you both in heart and work, and keep you in much enjoyment of Himself, serving from Him as well as for Him.<a name=305:34></a>

		[C McAdam] BELOVED BROTHER, -- My life is such a routine here outwardly (I hope not inwardly), that as to work, I have not much to tell you of.<a name=307:1></a> People come to hear, and with interest.<a name=307:2></a> In Brooklyn souls are making progress in the truth, and learning what it is to be a Christian.<a name=307:3></a> There are some young men who follow them up in grace -- here less.<a name=307:4></a> They come, and continue to come, and I trust there is a quiet work going on, but it is at present more preparatory in the dissemination of truth.<a name=307:5></a> There are, I trust, two new workmen whom the Lord is raising up .<a name=307:6></a>.<a name=307:7></a>.<a name=307:8></a> .<a name=307:9></a>

		I have no doubt that evil is increasing, as we are warned of it, but I believe the getting into the truth of real Christianity -- the light it brings -- makes the darkness and evil more visible.<a name=307:10></a> Heartlessness for God is what is most striking, and the pretensions of reason and man in making a god of his imaginings.<a name=307:11></a> Growth in knowledge is needed.<a name=307:12></a> That is a return back to original truth as in the word, and the light it gives -- both, in what is essential in our relationship with God.<a name=307:13></a> Blessed truth it is, and throws light on all that is around us!<a name=307:14></a> But while this is needed to walk in these times, yet assuming this, what I feel anxious about as to brethren is their being devoted, and <i>not conformed to the world</i>: simplicity and undistractedness of walk, and in their ways, non-conformity to the world, that the testimony may be distinct, and the <i>effect</i> of these truths.<a name=307:15></a> This, and walking in living communion with God, is what I pray for the brethren.<a name=307:16></a> "The word of his patience," and we as men that wait for their Lord, is what we are to have at heart.<a name=307:17></a> But the Philadelphian state connects itself distinctly with Christ: "my word," "my name," and such He will shew that He has loved, and this is worth all the rest.<a name=307:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We must not forget, in the sense of the evil around us, that the Lord remains the same.<a name=307:19></a> What was <i>heart</i> infidelity before, as return to truth develops itself, becomes open and positive infidelity, and Christianity must take its relative place of positive faith: faith wrought by the Holy Ghost in the word -- direct faith in it, not by education nor by the church.<a name=307:20></a> Any profession, merely such, will be rather the corruption and moral apostasy of ritualism -- a very real thing, but which makes the church the ground of believing, for faith it is not Direct faith in the ward, that is in God, is the test of real Christianity, The church becomes a judged thing, not the ground of believing.<a name=307:21></a> This is a very definite position, but which allows nothing but real faith -- always true, but brought out to light by growing corruption and evil.<a name=307:22></a> But then it is of all moment that devotedness and a holy walk be maintained; because men judge more by this, and as a testimony, this ever was and must be so.<a name=307:23></a> "He that is holy" is with "He that is true" in Christ's character for the Philadelphian state.<a name=307:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One thing is needed for the workman: good courage because of the Lord, not terrified by adversaries.<a name=307:25></a> See Joshua 1; 2 Timothy -- beginning the work, and when the evil had come in and the last days were in view.<a name=307:26></a> The Lord is above the evil, though He does not set it aside till judgment- and faith recognises that He is.<a name=307:27></a> Did He set it aside He must judge, and then the time of grace would be over .<a name=307:28></a>.<a name=307:29></a>.<a name=307:30></a> .<a name=307:31></a> The gracious Lord be with you.<a name=307:32></a> Love to the brethren.<a name=307:33></a>

		I came here, though I thought I had done with these parts, because the last time I was here I found the doors opening among the Americans.<a name=308:11></a> The difficulty is that a diligent effort has been made to disseminate the truths we have been taught so as that people should have them, and not act on them -- remain where they are.<a name=308:12></a> Eminent ministers preach the Lord's coming, the ruin of the church, liberty of ministry, and avowedly from brethren's books, and stay where they are, and there is a general deadening of conscience.<a name=308:13></a> Now people come, are interested, surprised at all the truth they find in scripture, but for the moment with most it ends there.<a name=308:14></a> This casts me on the Lord.<a name=308:15></a> It was so the last time out west; still the Lord called out some, and new gatherings were formed.<a name=308:16></a> It is His work, but the wide spread of brethren's truths alters the character of the work.<a name=308:17></a> At present it is sowing time.<a name=308:18></a> After all, they spoil the truths where they do not act on them.<a name=308:19></a> Assurance of salvation has taken hold on many now.<a name=308:20></a> When I began it was, so to say, unknown.<a name=308:21></a> Still the Lord works where there is simplicity and devotedness.<a name=308:22></a> There is very little fixed principle as to anything here.<a name=308:23></a> If the brethren are devoted and unworldly, then there is a testimony, but mere knowledge of truth does not bring out, as when no one had it at all.<a name=308:24></a> In spite of what I said above there is progress, more than one soul has found peace since I came here, and some have been added.<a name=308:25></a> It is pleasant to see simple souls full of joy, and that by the Spirit, for it is eternal joy, while wise ones are ever learning .<a name=308:26></a>.<a name=308:27></a>.<a name=308:28></a> .<a name=308:29></a>

		[From the French.<a name=310:15></a>] DEAR BROTHER, -- There is nothing surprising in your experience, in a case in which there is a tendency to fall back upon oneself, and when the conscience is really engaged in it.<a name=310:16></a> It does not appear, from what you tell me, that you were much exercised before being brought to believe.<a name=310:17></a> In such a case experience has to be passed through after conversion.<a name=310:18></a> In my own case, I went through deep exercise of soul before there was a trace of peace, and it was not till after six or seven years that I was delivered.<a name=310:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, when there is not at first the experience of what one is, and there is much turning in on oneself, we must pass through it; and if there is carelessness Satan uses it to throw everything into uncertainty, to make us ask if we have not been deceiving ourselves, to give us the idea that we have committed the sin against the Holy Ghost (a very common experience, although the thought even is not found in the word).<a name=310:20></a> But it is always in such cases that one has not given up connecting the state of the soul with the question of acceptance.<a name=310:21></a> Now, any one who does that is under law, and he who is under law does not believe himself to be already lost.<a name=310:22></a> He may accept this as a truth and in relation to his guilt; but that means that we have deserved condemnation, so that we dread condemnation; and it is quite another thing from believing that we are already lost.<a name=310:23></a> When we connect our state with the question of acceptance, a better state would get us out of the difficulty.<a name=310:24></a> The law always supposes the possibility of a state which would give peace, of a "salvable" state: now such a state does not exist.<a name=310:25></a> If we are already lost, it is no longer a question to be resolved.<a name=310:26></a> Moreover, this condition may be prolonged, because if one is not in the presence of God, we do not openly and really come to the consciousness of our state; and this must be in order to have solid peace; for no state, either existing or hoped for, is the righteousness of God.<a name=310:27></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		When this work is complete, we give up looking at ourselves in order to solve the question as to whether we are in the favour of God -- though not in order to cultivate piety, and to walk in communion.<a name=310:28></a> We are accepted in the Beloved, the righteousness of God in Him: He appears in the presence of God for us; we have the consciousness of our relationship -- we cry, Abba, Father, in the same relationship with God as Christ, in divine favour.<a name=310:29></a> We seek to keep close to God, to our Father; we seek not to grieve the Holy Spirit, we seek to please Christ and not to displease Him; but all this according to the relationship and the favour in which we are, as "the elect of God, holy and beloved.<a name=310:30></a>" The affections have to do with the relationship, not our judgment as to the relationship with the affections.<a name=310:31></a> "Thou shalt love" -- that is always law: it is not, "God so loved.<a name=310:32></a>" We are made perfect in love by dwelling in Him; and "we love him" -- not, we ought to love Him -- "because he first loved us.<a name=310:33></a>" Love, for a superior, consists in a deep consciousness of His love which binds the heart to Him, and makes us feel how little (when the 'ought' comes in) we love Him as we ought to love Him.<a name=310:34></a> We feed on Christ: we judge ourselves as to all that is not pleasing to Him, we desire to be devoted to Him because we owe ourselves to Him.<a name=310:35></a> Save this judgment of self, and watchfulness, always necessary, we think of Him and not of ourselves: by judging ourselves, we ward off what is evil; by thinking of Him, we make progress.<a name=310:36></a> We have the consciousness that nothing separates us from Him, from the love of God in Him.<a name=310:37></a> I draw a conclusion, a just and holy one (Romans 5), that; if I am reconciled by His death I shall be saved by His life.<a name=310:38></a> Yea, we joy in God; and if I say too God is for me, nothing shall separate me from His love, fully manifested in Christ -- that is where I am.<a name=310:39></a> What happiness!<a name=310:40></a> This is the joy now which will also be our joy for ever.<a name=310:41></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us exercise all diligence, all watchfulness: let us watch and pray, that we may not be deceived by the enemy; we need this.<a name=310:42></a> There is all the more need of it if we have been at a distance from God, in order that we may acquire renewed strength in His love.<a name=310:43></a> But when we have done with ourselves, as having no good in ourselves, we no longer look for it.<a name=310:44></a> Only we must get there- then we know that by the cross of Christ we have done with sin in the flesh, for it has been condemned and judged there as a whole.<a name=310:45></a> Then we think of love and of God, instead of thinking of ourselves; we feed on the Bread which came down from heaven, we become attached to Christ we feel that He is precious, that He is everything,, to our souls.<a name=310:46></a> But, I repeat, we are occupied with what is in Him, not with what is in ourselves.<a name=310:47></a> That is far better.<a name=310:48></a>

		[From the French.<a name=314:1></a>] [ -- - If a child habitually neglected his father, and did not take the trouble of knowing his mind and will, it is easy to foresee that, when a difficulty presented itself, this child would not be in a position to understand what would please his parent.<a name=314:2></a> There are certain things that God leaves in <i>generalities</i>, in order that the state of soul of the <i>individual</i> may be proved.<a name=314:3></a> If, instead of the case I have supposed of a child, it were a question of a wife towards her husband, it is probable that, if she had the feelings and mind of a wife, she would not hesitate a moment as to knowing what would be agreeable to him; and this even when he had never expressed his will about the matter.<a name=314:4></a> Now you cannot escape this testing: nor will God allow His children to escape it.<a name=314:5></a> "If thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.<a name=314:6></a>"

		As to a convenient and comfortable means of knowing the will of God, as one might have a receipt for anything, no such thing exists -- of knowing it, I would say, without reference to the state of our own soul.<a name=314:7></a> Another thing -- we are often of too much importance in our own eyes; and we deceive ourselves in supposing some will of God in such or such a case.<a name=314:8></a> God perhaps has nothing to say to us thereon, the evil being altogether in the stir we give ourselves.<a name=314:9></a> The will of God is perhaps that we should quietly take an insignificant place.<a name=314:10></a> Further, we sometimes seek God's will, desiring to know how to act in circumstances <i>where His only will is that we should not be found in them at all</i>; and where, if conscience were really in activity its first effect would be to make us leave them.<a name=314:11></a> Our own will places us there, and we should like nevertheless to enjoy the comfort of being guided of God in a path which we ourselves have chosen.<a name=314:12></a> This is a very common case.<a name=314:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Be assured that, if we are near enough to God, we shall not be at a loss to know His will.<a name=314:14></a> In a long and active life it may happen, that God, in His love, does not always at once reveal His will to us, in order to make us feel our dependence, when there is perhaps in the individual a tendency to act according to his own will.<a name=314:15></a> Nevertheless, "if thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light"; whence it is certain that, if the whole body is not full of light, the eye is not single.<a name=314:16></a> You will say, That is a poor consolation.<a name=314:17></a> I answer, It is rich consolation for those whose sole desire is to have the eye single, and to <i>walk with God</i> -- not, so to speak, to avoid this trouble in learning His will objectively, but whose desire is to walk with God.<a name=314:18></a> "If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.<a name=314:19></a> But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him.<a name=314:20></a>" It is always the same principle.<a name=314:21></a> "He that followeth, me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.<a name=314:22></a>" You cannot exempt yourself from the moral law of Christianity.<a name=314:23></a> "For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding, that ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing by the knowledge of God.<a name=314:24></a>" The mutual connection of these things is of immense importance for the soul: the Lord must be known intimately in order to be able to walk in a way worthy of Him; and it is thus that we grow in the knowledge of God's will.<a name=314:25></a> "And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all intelligence, that ye may approve things that are excellent, in order that ye may be sincere and stumble not till the day of Christ.<a name=314:26></a>" Finally, it is written that "the spiritual man discerneth <i>all things</i>, yet he himself is discerned of no one.<a name=314:27></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is then the will of God, and a precious will, that we should only be able to discern His will according to our own spiritual state; and, in general, when we think that we are judging circumstances it is God who is judging us, judging our state: our business is to keep close to Him.<a name=314:28></a> God would not be good to us, if He permitted us to discover His will without that.<a name=314:29></a> It might be convenient just to have a director of consciences; and we should thus be spared the discovery and the chastisement of our moral condition.<a name=314:30></a> Thus, if you are seeking how you may discover the will of God without that, you are seeking evil; and it is what we see every day.<a name=314:31></a> One Christian is in doubt, in perplexity; another, more spiritual, sees as clear as the day: he is astonished at the uncertainty of the other; he sees no difficulty, and ends by understanding that it lies only in the other's state of soul.<a name=314:32></a> "He with whom these things are lacking is blind, and cannot see afar off.<a name=314:33></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards <i>circumstances</i>, I believe that a person may be guided by them; scripture has decided that.<a name=314:34></a> It is what it speaks of as being "held in with bit and bridle.<a name=314:35></a>" "I will instruct thee, and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: will guide thee with mine eye" -- such is the promise and privilege of him who has faith, is near enough to God to understand by a single glance from Him.<a name=314:36></a> God who is faithful, has given the promise to guide him thus.<a name=314:37></a> He warns us not to be as the horse and the mule which have no understanding of the will, thoughts, or desires of their master.<a name=314:38></a> They must be held in with bit and bridle.<a name=314:39></a> Doubtless even that is better than to stumble, fall, and run counter to Him who holds us in; but it is a sad state -- and such it is to be <i>guided by circumstances</i>.<a name=314:40></a> Undoubtedly, even then, it is merciful on God's part so to act, but very sad on ours.<a name=314:41></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here, however, there must be a distinction drawn between judging what one <i>has to do in</i> certain circumstances, and being <i>guided by</i> them.<a name=314:42></a> He who allows himself to be guided by them always acts blindly as to the knowledge of the will of God: there is absolutely nothing moral in it; it is an external force that constrains.<a name=314:43></a> Now it is very possible that I may have no judgment beforehand as to what I should do: I know not what circumstances may arise and consequently I can make no resolution.<a name=314:44></a> But so soon as the circumstances are there, I judge with a full and divine conviction what is the path of God's will, and of the Spirit's intention and power.<a name=314:45></a> This requires spirituality, and abiding in communion with God.<a name=314:46></a> It is not to be guided by the circumstances, but to be guided by God in them, being near enough to God to be able to judge immediately what one ought to do, as soon as the circumstances are there.<a name=314:47></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to impressions, God can suggest them, and it is certain that He does in fact suggest a thing to the mind; but, in that case, the propriety of the thing and its moral character will be clear as the sun at noon-day.<a name=314:48></a> In prayer God can remove from our heart certain carnal influences, which, being annulled, permit of certain other spiritual influences taking all their place in the soul; or He makes us feel the importance of some duty, which had been perhaps entirely thrown into the shade through pre-occupation caused by some desired object.<a name=314:49></a> This may be even between two individuals.<a name=314:50></a> One person may not have enough spiritual discernment to discover what is right, but the moment another shews it to him, he understands that it is the truth.<a name=314:51></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All are not engineers, but a simple waggoner knows a good road when once it is made.<a name=314:52></a> Thus impressions which come from God do not always remain simple impressions.<a name=314:53></a> But they are ordinarily clear when God produces them.<a name=314:54></a> I do not doubt, however, that He often makes them on our minds, when we walk with Him and listen to His voice.<a name=314:55></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When you speak of obstacles raised up by Satan, it is not said that God Himself may not have permitted these obstacles to the accomplishment of some good desire -- obstacles caused by an accumulation of evil in the circumstances which surround us.<a name=314:56></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Your third question supposes that a person acts without having the knowledge of the will of God, a case that should never exist at all.<a name=314:57></a> The only rule that can be given is, never to act when we do not know what is the Lord's will.<a name=314:58></a> The will of God ought to be the motive as well as the rule of our conduct; and until His will is in activity, there is an absence of any true motor for ours.<a name=314:59></a> If you act in ignorance in this respect, you are at the mercy of <i>circumstances</i>, God making all turn, nevertheless, to the good of His children: for this is ever the case supposed by your question.<a name=314:60></a> But why act when we are ignorant what His will is?<a name=314:61></a> Is the necessity of acting always so extremely pressing?<a name=314:62></a> If I do something with the full certainty that I am doing the will of God, then it is clear that an obstacle is no more than a test of my faith, and it ought not to stop me.<a name=314:63></a> It stops us perhaps through our lack of faith; because, if we do not walk sufficiently near to God in the sense of our nothingness, we shall always lack faith to <i>accomplish</i> what we have faith enough to <i>discern</i>.<a name=314:64></a> When we are doing our own will, or are negligent in our walk, God in His mercy may warn us by an obstacle which arrests us if we give heed to it, whilst "the simple pass on and are punished.<a name=314:65></a>" God may permit, where there is much activity and labour, that Satan should raise up obstacles, in order that we may be kept in dependence on the Lord; but God never allows Satan to act otherwise than on the flesh.<a name=314:66></a> If we leave the door open, if we get away from God, Satan does us harm; but otherwise his efforts are only a test for faith, to warn us of some danger or snare, or of something that would tend to exalt us in our own eyes.<a name=314:67></a> It is an instrument for our correction.<a name=314:68></a> That is, God allows Satan to trouble the mind, and make the flesh suffer outwardly, in order that the inner man may be kept from evil.<a name=314:69></a> If it is a question of anything else, probably it is only our '<i>buts</i>' and '<i>ifs</i>' that stop us, or possibly the effects of our carelessness which has opened a door to Satan to trouble us by doubts, and apparent difficulties between God and us, because we do not see more clearly.<a name=314:70></a> For "he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not.<a name=314:71></a>" In a word, the question is wholly <i>moral</i>.<a name=314:72></a> If any particular question is raised which at first view we cannot decide, we shall find that often there would be no such question there at all, if our position were not false -- if we had previously been in a good state of soul, and a true spirituality had kept and preserved us.<a name=314:73></a> Then all we have to do is to humble ourselves for the whole affair
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now let us examine whether scripture does not present some principle suitable to direct us; and here it is evident spirituality is the essential thing -- is everything.<a name=314:74></a> The rule that is given you is excellent, where and when it can be applied that is, to do what Jesus would have done in such or such a circumstance But are we often in the circumstances wherein the Lord would have been found?<a name=314:75></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the next place, it is often useful to ask myself whence comes such a desire of mine, or such a thought of doing this or that.<a name=314:76></a> I have found that this alone decides more than half the difficulties that Christians may meet with.<a name=314:77></a> Two-thirds of those which remain are the result of our haste, and of our former sins.<a name=314:78></a> If a thought comes from God and not from the flesh, then we have only to address ourselves to God as to the manner and means of executing it, and we shall soon be directed.<a name=314:79></a> There are cases where one has need of being guided not always without motives; as suppose, when I hesitate about a visit to make, or some such other case.<a name=314:80></a> A life of more fervent love, or love exercised in a more intelligent way, or set in activity in drawing near to God, will make clear the motives on one side or the other; and often, perhaps, we shall see that our part in the thing was only selfishness.<a name=314:81></a> Do you say, But if it is no question either of love or of obedience?<a name=314:82></a> then I answer that you ought to shew me a reason for acting.<a name=314:83></a> For if it is nothing but your own will, you cannot make the wisdom of God bend to your will.<a name=314:84></a> Therein also is the source of another numerous class of difficulties that God will never solve.<a name=314:85></a> In these cases He will in His grace teach obedience, and will shew us how much time we have lost in our own activity.<a name=314:86></a> Finally, "the meek will he guide in judgment, and the meek will he teach his way.<a name=314:87></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have communicated to you on this subject all that my mind can furnish you with at this moment.<a name=314:88></a> For the rest!<a name=314:89></a> remember only that the wisdom of God conducts us in the way of God's will: if our own will is in activity, God cannot bend to that.<a name=314:90></a> That is the essential thing to discover.<a name=314:91></a> It is the secret of the life of Christ.<a name=314:92></a> I know no other principle that God can make use of, however He may pardon and cause all to turn to our good.<a name=314:93></a> But you inquire of me still as to His direction.<a name=314:94></a> He directs the new man, which has no other will than Christ.<a name=314:95></a> He mortifies and puts to death the old man, and in that way purifies us that we may bear fruit.<a name=314:96></a> "Lo, I come to do thy will, O God.<a name=314:97></a>" .<a name=314:98></a>.<a name=314:99></a>.<a name=314:100></a> "I delight" to do it.<a name=314:101></a> It is the place of a porter to wait at the gate; but, in doing so, he does the will of his master.<a name=314:102></a> Be assured that God does more in us than we for Him; and what we do is only <i>for Him</i> just in so far as it is He Himself who works it in us.<a name=314:103></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I add with regard to a principle expressed above, that we are sanctified to the "obedience .<a name=314:104></a>.<a name=314:105></a>.<a name=314:106></a> of Jesus Christ.<a name=314:107></a>" Now He came to do the will of His Father, without which He did nothing.<a name=314:108></a> Thus, in the temptation in the wilderness, Satan tried to make Him act according to His own will, in things where there was not even an appearance of evil.<a name=314:109></a> The Father had just owned Him as His Son; Satan tempted Him, saying, 'If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.<a name=314:110></a>' But Jesus was a servant, and His answer consists in doing nothing, because there was wholly no will of His Father in the matter: "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.<a name=314:111></a>".<a name=314:112></a> As there was no word from God for the actual circumstances, Jesus did nothing.<a name=314:113></a> Satan could do nothing more.<a name=314:114></a> Although ever active to do good, He did not stir, when Mary and Martha sent to tell Him "he whom thou lovest is sick.<a name=314:115></a>" His Father had not sent Him there.<a name=314:116></a> When He goes later, the wisdom of God is thus manifested, in that a testimony to the divine power of Jesus as Son of God was rendered by the resurrection of Lazarus.<a name=314:117></a> So then, when the will of God is not manifested, our wisdom often consists in waiting until it should be.<a name=314:118></a> It is the will of God that, zealous of good works, we should do good always but we cannot go before the time, and the work of God is done perfectly when it is He who does it.<a name=314:119></a>]<br>1856.<a name=314:120></a>

		-- - As a general truth<a href="#320:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> we may surely look for guidance, and to "be filled with the knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding.<a name=320:1></a>" What I said as to this was, not that God should not direct us, but that, as the general principle, it was not independent of spiritual understanding; that if I were directed right, even in every act as a Roman Catholic, by their confessor, called their director, I should lose by it -- it would save me being in a spiritual state myself -- though, surely, a more spiritual person might help me because he was so; that God did not mean our perception of His will to be independent of our spiritual state, though He can, of course, lead any, at any given time.<a name=320:2></a> Psalm 32 speaks of this also.<a name=320:3></a> If our eye be single, our whole body shall be full of light.<a name=320:4></a> But this is always true; He makes everything work together for good to them that love Him.<a name=320:5></a> He overrules as well as rules.<a name=320:6></a>

		I will suppose for a moment you were not led of Him in going to England -- which I do not the least say, as I know nothing of it or your motives, but suppose the case: He makes you know what the world's giving you up is; He overrules it.<a name=320:7></a> Supposing you had a tide of blessing, you would not have felt this in the same way, you would have tided it over the shoals at flood.<a name=320:8></a> I remember saying to dear Captain W.<a name=320:9></a>, that our giving up the world and the world giving us up, were two very different things.<a name=320:10></a> It is the latter tries all the elements of self-importance, which lie much deeper rooted than we are aware.<a name=320:11></a> There may be some little sacrifice in giving it up, but we have a sufficient motive, but what motive for being despised?<a name=320:12></a> it is really our glory, for Christ was, but then He must be all, and that is saying a good deal.<a name=320:13></a> We are poor feeble creatures without a stable centre -- what would be so, has to be broken, and Christ take its place; I do not speak of failure, but what we go through.<a name=320:14></a> He was the despised and rejected of men.<a name=320:15></a> Nor does He seek insensibility to it, but superiority over it, by His being all; and that is blessed, that only lasts.<a name=320:16></a> It is the production in us of what is eternal joy, and capacity for it.<a name=320:17></a>

		And, now to your special inquiry<a href="#320:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a> more in detail.<a name=320:18></a> There are many points to consider.<a name=320:19></a> First, I believe this casting on, dependent, seeking His will spiritually, to be a privilege, though connected with the ruined state of the church.<a name=320:20></a> He cannot cease to guide us, or where should we be?<a name=320:21></a> But He may not, and does not, manifest His action with a fallen as with a fresh and nascent church.<a name=320:22></a> He never does so.<a name=320:23></a> "We see not our signs; there is no more any prophet; neither is there among us any that knoweth how long.<a name=320:24></a>" Yet Haggai says, "My Spirit remaineth among you," as when they came out of Egypt.<a name=320:25></a> I believe faithfulness, in such a time, special privilege.<a name=320:26></a> "Hast not denied my name" does not say much, but when this happens all around, it is a great deal, and great grace to be kept.<a name=320:27></a> You cannot be expected -- "according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that by them, thou mightest war a good warfare.<a name=320:28></a>" You came out with a true heart to One who loved you, and seek souls for Him -- All right, and great grace given to us; but there was no "separate me Barnabas and Paul," which, though present grace must after all sustain, still was a source of strength -- "by them.<a name=320:29></a>" I do not believe it is any loss, but it is different; and he that has the secret of Christ, while he will not limit His power, yet will know the difference and enter into it.<a name=320:30></a> "Thou hast a little strength"; and these were pillars when God built His temple.<a name=320:31></a> We find they were forbidden to go into Bithynia, sought to go into Mysia, the Spirit suffered them not; they were forbidden to preach the word in Asia, and then by a vision in a dream were led into Macedonia.<a name=320:32></a> Now I would not the least deny that God can by His Holy Spirit suggest to us a special place of service.<a name=320:33></a> I do not doubt He may; but it is not an open manifestation as that which we here read of.<a name=320:34></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I repeat, I believe it is a privilege to be thus cast on the Lord's heart, if we only trust it; but it is a different thing, if we are cast on it, that there is imperfection in us, which affects this question: even an apostle had to learn this.<a name=320:35></a> A great door was opened at Troas, "but I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother," he leaves it.<a name=320:36></a> "In Macedonia my flesh had no rest; without were fightings, within were fears.<a name=320:37></a>" He was sorry even he had written an inspired epistle which really wrought as such with power in producing its effect, as in blessing to this day; but here there was trust.<a name=320:38></a> It is quite the contrary to the English translation, "causeth us to triumph" (2 Corinthians 2: 14); the word means, "leads us in triumph" -- and the savour of Christ for life or for death, spread by him whether at Troas or Macedonia.<a name=320:39></a> He trusted in Him will led him where He pleased, and that by his anxieties, as by His Spirit.<a name=320:40></a> He could not say he was right to leave Troas, and all was distress in Macedonia; it was love to the Corinthians; and God comforts them that are cast down: that is His way.<a name=320:41></a> And this is the picture I got of this great and noble heart, sent, as he was, openly by the Lord Himself and the Holy Ghost.<a name=320:42></a> He was a man, and must learn it, and that the power was of God; and so must dear -- perhaps as cast down, but any way as led about in triumph, for it is as true of you.<a name=320:43></a> God is as faithful as to you, as He was as to Paul.<a name=320:44></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is another point, we are such little ignorant things that though we may have the spirit "of power and love and a sound mind," not of bondage and fear, still, as I said, things have to be overruled as well as ourselves guided.<a name=320:45></a> In the case you suppose<a href="#320:f3"><sup class="footnote-link">+++</sup></a> you do not find the man at home.<a name=320:46></a> This may have been just the right thing, that you should have shewn the purpose and desire, and yet not have seen him, nor he received the visit.<a name=320:47></a> It was not the ripe moment for that; it was for seeking him.<a name=320:48></a> I admit, were we perfect this would not be so.<a name=320:49></a> Again, He might have sent you on that road on purpose to meet the person on the way, and another day as good or better for the visit; perhaps he was not at home.<a name=320:50></a> I grant this shews imperfection, but not that there is no guidance.<a name=320:51></a> We should like to go always with a full, favourable wind, but this does not make a good sailor.<a name=320:52></a> It does tell us of weakness and imperfection, but that is something to learn, and dependence too.<a name=320:53></a> We cannot make a visit right without His hand.<a name=320:54></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But now take an example of where power was.<a name=320:55></a> Paul, apostle as he was, cannot succeed in persuading the church at Antioch to leave the Gentiles free.<a name=320:56></a> Where was his apostolic power?<a name=320:57></a> What a defeat!<a name=320:58></a> what a failure!<a name=320:59></a> He must go to Jerusalem.<a name=320:60></a> Now suppose he had succeeded: humanly speaking, two churches were started -- one at Antioch, free; the other at Jerusalem Jewish and circumcising Gentiles; but Jerusalem is forced by God to pronounce the Gentile free, and all goes right for the time.<a name=320:61></a> No doubt it was connected with imperfection and wretched ignorance of heart and prejudice; but it was divine grace and wisdom, God working in this imperfection and prejudice and overruling it, and Paul must take his place under this, like others.<a name=320:62></a>

		At the beginning brethren were engaged, and pretty much alone, in the roughest evangelising -- fairs, markets, races, regattas, and everywhere in the open air.<a name=324:20></a> Gatherings grew up, and the care of them became needful, though evangelising went on, and was blessed, and in a measure is in many places.<a name=324:21></a> Others since have occupied the field who are really their followers under God.<a name=324:22></a> If even contention mix itself with this -- if Christ be preached we ought to rejoice.<a name=324:23></a> But the care of the scattered gatherings is most precious work, not altogether neglected, but the labourers are few.<a name=324:24></a> There is no reason why -- should not exercise this local care for a time, and there is large room for it.<a name=324:25></a> If God still calls him to evangelise, he will find the craving after souls forcing him out to do that work.<a name=324:26></a> At all times in a general way we have to do it, as Paul says to Timothy.<a name=324:27></a> Often those nearer the state of the unconverted are more apt for it.<a name=324:28></a> This may be imperfection, but so it is, and if then they go on holding to that, they grow little, and meet little the spiritual wants of these last days.<a name=324:29></a>

		[To the same.<a name=326:1></a>] W G Heney, As to "the Christ," there is no ground whatever for making the Christ the church.<a name=326:2></a> Nine-tenths of the cases where we have Christ in English, it is the Christ in Greek.<a name=326:3></a> Christ was not properly a name, but a title, meaning (the same as Messiah in Hebrew), in English 'anointed': "Jesus is the Christ"; but it very soon became a name, but the personal name is Jesus.<a name=326:4></a> The only place out of, I suppose, hundreds, where the Christ is used for the principle of union among saints, is 1 Corinthians 12 -- tantamount to 'so it is in the case of the Christ.<a name=326:5></a>' It never means properly the body, but is used for a name which brings us into relationship with Him, because the anointed One is the Head of all the anointed ones.<a name=326:6></a> (See John 1: 33.<a name=326:7></a>) Hence the change in Romans 8: 11, where Jesus is used as the personal name.<a name=326:8></a> and Christ not at all as the body, but as the Head of those who will be raised, because of Him.<a name=326:9></a>

		Your other question is more difficult to answer, as the objection is more subtle.<a name=326:10></a> The special object of John's charges was those who denied the real humanity of Christ, which was done in those days.<a name=326:11></a> But the apostle enlarges the thought in speaking more generally of the doctrine of the Christ (2 John 9) the christian doctrine of the Messiah.<a name=326:12></a> Still the subject here is the person of Christ, more especially as characterising the Antichrist.<a name=326:13></a> (Compare 1 John 4: 2, 3.<a name=326:14></a>) Only in neither is it "that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh," but confess "Jesus Christ come in the flesh.<a name=326:15></a>" But this is not all the instruction of scripture on the subject.<a name=326:16></a> Supposing a person denied the Holy Ghost for instance: and damnable heresies are brought in privily, and we have to see whether the doctrine of the Christ is involved in them, and this is often the case.<a name=326:17></a> But in 2 Timothy 2, those who were overthrowing the faith of some, only said that the resurrection was past already, and the apostle calls on the faithful to purge themselves from them.<a name=326:18></a> (2 Timothy 2: 17-21.<a name=326:19></a>) It is no charity to set people at ease who are teaching or receiving what "eats as a canker.<a name=326:20></a>" I make a difference.<a name=326:21></a> With a teacher I could have nothing to do.<a name=326:22></a> It is the duty of positive testimony against him, "knowing such are perverted," if his doctrine touches "the faith of God's elect.<a name=326:23></a>" With those misled I can make a difference; those deliberately in it I should avoid, they support the evil and sustain it; some are merely misled, and while I had hope of recovering them, I might not wholly repulse them, but evil communications corrupt good manners; it is danger to ones own soul to have to say to what the devil teaches, unless called upon by God to meet it.<a name=326:24></a> I should not dare to do so.<a name=326:25></a> And even with those misled, it is no kindness to go on as if nothing was the matter, when they are really led of the enemy.<a name=326:26></a> I do not want to set them at their ease there.<a name=326:27></a> As to the word "God speed," it is associating oneself with their work.<a name=326:28></a> He is speaking of those "deceivers" who were "gone out into the world," and going about with this false doctrine; and wishing him well on his journey, was associating oneself with them in it.<a name=326:29></a> Such I would not receive Into my house.<a name=326:30></a> I trust I have made plain to you what I desired to say from the word.<a name=326:31></a> It is one of the great evils of the day to the truth.<a name=326:32></a> "Whom I love," says the apostle, "in the truth" and for the truth's sake.<a name=326:33></a> None urge this point more than John, whom men count as the apostle of love.<a name=326:34></a>

		[From the French.<a name=331:1></a>] -- - The Saviour is indeed coming, and in that day all that has not been of Him will be vanity and nothingness; and even now it is nothing more, but faith alone perceives this.<a name=331:2></a> May God give you, dear brother, to live close to Him!<a name=331:3></a> I reject wholly the theories of Mr.<a name=331:4></a> R.<a name=331:5></a> page S.<a name=331:6></a>, and his false perfection; yet there is a power which keeps us close to God, so that sin does not enter, the wicked one does not touch us, the flesh is not brought into activity.<a name=331:7></a> The soul is then occupied with the Lord, and with what concerns Him.<a name=331:8></a> It is not only kept from what is corrupt in its thoughts, but from irritation and passion, from that which is not lust, but the fruit of unmortified flesh.<a name=331:9></a> Observe the distinction between these things in Colossians 3: 5-8.<a name=331:10></a> Humility accompanies this condition, but we need diligence, and the word "watch.<a name=331:11></a>" "Watch unto prayer," as well as "in prayer.<a name=331:12></a>" When one allows oneself to go after folly, after those things which belong to the old creation, the soul has no longer the divine strength which is needed to walk with Him without distraction; but, on the other hand, to walk thus is liberty and peace: it is a good atmosphere.<a name=331:13></a> (Philippians 4: 8)

		W G Heney, And now dear -- , what are we doing, living near God, waiting for His Son from heaven.<a name=331:14></a> What else have we to do?<a name=331:15></a> What else would we have done when the end comes, when we see His face?<a name=331:16></a> We have to work with a force sometimes secret to us, follow His word, have His motives, depend on His strength, but wait for the result (though possibly partially manifested now, cheering and rejoicing us) when Jesus shall come; and then the work will be pure and its motive pure -- not fall back on us as now, that is, self be mixed with it.<a name=331:17></a> The brethren rejoiced when they heard of the conversion of the Gentiles, and the apostle related to the church what God had wrought.<a name=331:18></a> (Acts 14: 27) But for Paul's own soul it was at Christ's coming that he saw the fruit of his labours.<a name=331:19></a> And that is when we shall rejoice in them, the labourer's crown no doubt, but Christ's glory eternally, and their own blessedness: it is identified with divine love and His glory.<a name=331:20></a> In this our path is a path of faith, and this carries through the dark and difficult passes of ministry with a single eye, and makes Christ everything.<a name=331:21></a> We are satisfied with "I know thy works.<a name=331:22></a>" But we have to be manifested to God, to walk as if we were before the judgment-seat as to ourselves, and in love to others, seeking what they need from Christ, not thinking of party or sect.<a name=331:23></a> An exercised soul is a great thing; "herein do I exercise myself" day and night -- yet well imbued with love.<a name=331:24></a> There I feel myself weak.<a name=331:25></a> Care for the saints I do, but divine love I find too feeble in my soul.<a name=331:26></a> I have no object but Christ, but that is another thing.<a name=331:27></a> See what ministry flows from.<a name=331:28></a> (Ephesians 4) Christ has overcome Satan, and having received the promise of the Father for us as man, has made those delivered the vessels of His power and gifts for the warfare that has to be carried on.<a name=331:29></a> He has gone down into the lower parts of the earth, and thence far above all heavens, filling all things in the power of redemption, and so gives apostles, prophets, and the rest, for the perfecting of the saints, making them to grow up to the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.<a name=331:30></a> Who, we may well say, is sufficient for these things?<a name=331:31></a> But I must close.<a name=331:32></a> May grace be with you, and peace, and strengthen your hands, keeping you close to Him.<a name=331:33></a> Kindest love to the brethren .<a name=331:34></a>.<a name=331:35></a>.<a name=331:36></a> .<a name=331:37></a> May the Lord keep all His saints, and hasten His coming.<a name=331:38></a>

		[R T Grant] DEAREST BROTHER, -- As regards Colossians 1, it is long a settled thought with me that there are here two ministries.<a name=333:1></a> You may see two headships, two reconciliation, and two ministries; ministry in the whole creation under heaven, and ministry of the church to complete the word of God.<a name=333:2></a> The revelation of the mystery had been reserved till now.<a name=333:3></a> S.<a name=333:4></a> is very anxious that these ministries should not be separated, that is, the church and the gospel of salvation.<a name=333:5></a> They sometimes are partially, outside brethren: revivalist preaching characterises the separation.<a name=333:6></a> One visit I made to Canada for six weeks only was to connect the two, and they have gone pretty well since.<a name=333:7></a> It is a question which occupies people often.<a name=333:8></a> -- is greatly exercised by it, but now passing from the first into the second: -- partially from the second to the first.<a name=333:9></a> Few can so adapt themselves to all as to be each in its place; but where Christ is fully known, and His claims, it gives a tone to the first which leads on to the second: where it is only man's salvation this is not the case.<a name=333:10></a> God may allow this to carry out and hurry on the last testimony.<a name=333:11></a> Blessed be His name!<a name=333:12></a> He is above all our weaknesses I am not sure but that there was more union of the two at the first of the work of brethren.<a name=333:13></a> So many evangelists have come out since on all sides without church truth that the two have been more separated.<a name=333:14></a> It is one of the serious practical points of the present day; but, I repeat, God is above all this, and will accomplish His work.<a name=333:15></a>

		MY DEAR BROTHER, -- Thank you very much for sending me the account of your dear mother, whose simple-hearted and faithful walk has now ended so brightly.<a name=335:1></a> At her age it is but a natural and happy entering into rest, into what is far better.<a name=335:2></a> Abundant thanksgivings for your brother's conversion .<a name=335:3></a>.<a name=335:4></a>.<a name=335:5></a> .<a name=335:6></a> We must be more than content, if the Lord says "He hath done what he could.<a name=335:7></a>" We, at least I, cannot say it, though I seek to serve Him.<a name=335:8></a> It is a comfort that He says to Philadelphia, "I know thy works" -- without saying more -- and, "thou hast a little strength," so as we are kept faithful, not denying His name, and keeping the word of His patience.<a name=335:9></a> How very gracious of the Lord to let your mother know that your brother was converted!<a name=335:10></a> It changes nothing, it is true, but we should notice these ways of the Lord; He is gracious on the way as He is at the end, and it is always Himself.<a name=335:11></a> I think it is striking, the Lord letting Moody's and Pearsall Smith's work run over the world as it does.<a name=335:12></a> In Switzerland they are full of the latter, at least in Basle.<a name=335:13></a> I do not fear it: it is wakening up, as all these revivals work.<a name=335:14></a> God graciously allows the work to go on, that there may be this, and people called out; but it has a popularity most useful to it as service (but which it would soon lose -- perhaps would never have if they were faithful), which I certainly do not covet.<a name=335:15></a> The Establishment missions wrought of old somewhat similarly, and I doubt not there were many conversions, and rejoice with all my heart in it; but all beyond is worldly, and lowers the standard of Christianity.<a name=335:16></a> If the brethren keep it up their testimony will have its full place, besides the preaching of the gospel of the grace of God; and may it be with renewed energy!<a name=335:17></a> Church and remnant work and the Christian's place, of which they know nothing, remains where it was.<a name=335:18></a> A full plain gospel I have to work through with all of them -- the perfectionists, as Moody's people.<a name=335:19></a> They teach what ignores and denies it; but then we have only to add this, and make it plain, not oppose.<a name=335:20></a> For this I have a full opening, both at New York and here.<a name=335:21></a> In general we have cause for thankfulness here, but I should, as man, like to see things go faster, but you have to bring in a full gospel everywhere.<a name=335:22></a> No one has an idea of what God's children get as their teaching.<a name=335:23></a> But I must close.<a name=335:24></a>

		Dear C McAdam, -- I do not alter my judgment as to the Saturday meeting.<a name=338:1></a> Tuesday monthly, <i>partially</i> supplies conference, though only on general subjects, not inter-communication of receiving or exclusion.<a name=338:2></a> But if these meetings, you call county meetings, do not come, why are they kept on the list?<a name=338:3></a> A certain obstinacy, under the idea that it ministered to communion, made the thing fictitious.<a name=338:4></a> At South Croydon, they only read what concerned themselves, and give letters of commendation; and the proper local responsibility of these meetings which are not London, is in several cases weakened.<a name=338:5></a> I do not at all want to weaken the Saturday meeting, but to make it real.<a name=338:6></a> For the meetings in London, it was very useful, it did maintain the consciousness of unity, difficult in such a place as London.<a name=338:7></a> Had there been timely pliancy in dropping off meetings outside, the thing would have pruned itself.<a name=338:8></a> It became impractical, cumbersome, and fictitious.<a name=338:9></a> Croydon, Mitcham, and Plumstead, are not the unity of London.<a name=338:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred the local gatherings must form the judgment, but if they are to walk in unity in one place -- in such a place as London, where people slip about not to be known, mention of cases in all the gatherings ought to take place.<a name=338:11></a> I have known a case where a person was known, far from the place where he sought entrance, and the brethren spared the admission of a bad person.<a name=338:12></a> The difficulty of a person copying beforehand is that it is on the paper before any conference.<a name=338:13></a> The received names might be so copied, and if even objection came from a gathering, a stroke of the pen suffices.<a name=338:14></a> I see no objection to brethren from suburban places coming if they wish .<a name=338:15></a>.<a name=338:16></a>.<a name=338:17></a> .<a name=338:18></a> My objection to it is, it is not real now.<a name=338:19></a> Begin by not putting a quarter or a half as you say on the papers, and make it real, letting these brethren freely come if they wish.<a name=338:20></a> But the character of the meeting has falsified into a registry, useful in its place and way, and a reading-meeting for young men if there was time.<a name=338:21></a> It ceased to be a collective work of those interested in the gatherings.<a name=338:22></a> No discipline, I quite admit, could be exercised there, but cases might be spoken of and conferred about with the common light of brethren from the various gatherings in London.<a name=338:23></a> Generally the local brethren alone know the details necessarily, but many general principles of the word and correctives might come in by common counsel.<a name=338:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have seen nothing in print of what you sent me, but I feel it useless to read such things.<a name=338:25></a> We have to give our testimony in the midst of acknowledged ruin; the more we feel it, the better.<a name=338:26></a> What you refer to here, is a regular plan, forming union by exchange of pulpits, but godly souls are feeling it.<a name=338:27></a> It raises the question, Is truth to be held to?<a name=338:28></a> The coming of this state of things exercised me deeply in 1827, now I work in the midst of it: "save yourselves from this untoward generation.<a name=338:29></a>"

		The clergy are simply evil, and as such minister to evil, but our business is with positive truth, and good, a testimony as clear and full as we can, and a walk holy, devoted and unworldly.<a name=338:30></a> If we look to Christ's people, the Lord will work His work as to them -- and preach the gospel with earnestness while time yet remains.<a name=338:31></a> The testimony of the truth has certainly told on many consciences here, in the east of America.<a name=338:32></a>

		Dearest J Leslie, -- I think the brethren are entering into a new phase of existence, which increases danger to them, and brings greater, or at any rate more manifest, responsibility.<a name=339:1></a> It is not merely the justifications or excessive praise of men like -- , which good taste would let drop, though flattery be dangerous to any heart, but the now generally spread feeling (whatever effect it produces, for it is very diverse) that brethren have something which other Christians have not got.<a name=339:2></a> This is often refuted, hated, opposed, may be often a matter of curiosity, sometimes (and may it be increased!<a name=339:3></a>) of true inquiry; but it is felt.<a name=339:4></a> The world feels it, would use it to scorn the inconsistency of public profession.<a name=339:5></a> In many cases they would be sought and courted from their knowledge of scripture, their books read to have the truth without acting on it.<a name=339:6></a> Others.<a name=339:7></a> who still cling to the professing church with partial apprehensions of truth and much error, make their boast that it can be had without leaving the systems around us -- nay, sometimes openly urging continuance in them: but it is felt they have, what others have not.<a name=339:8></a> I believe they have.<a name=339:9></a> But what is important is, not the brethren, but the truth they have.<a name=339:10></a> I could state it definitely, and have ere now done it; but it is not my object here.<a name=339:11></a> God could set them aside, and spread His truth by others -- would, I believe?<a name=339:12></a> though full of gracious patience, if they be not faithful.<a name=339:13></a> Their place is to remain in obscurity and devotedness, not to think of brethren (it is always wrong to think of ourselves save to judge ourselves) but of souls, in Christ's name and love, and of His glory and truth only -- not to press brethrenism so-called, but to deal with each soul according to its need for Christ's sake.<a name=339:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But if attention is drawn, and it is, to the truth they possess through grace, their responsibility is very greatly increased.<a name=339:15></a> If more general and persevering devotedness is not found in them they would be a stumbling-block against the truth.<a name=339:16></a> Unworldliness, non-conformity to the world, self-denial, abnegation in love to others, is what is called for, for love is the end of the charge committed out of a pure heart.<a name=339:17></a> Let them walk in love, in the truth, humble, lowly, unworldly, and all for Christ, as little, <i>and content to be little</i>, as when they began, and God will bless them.<a name=339:18></a> If not, their candlestick may go (and oh, what sorrow and confusion of face it would be after such grace!<a name=339:19></a>) as that of others.<a name=339:20></a> Let there be no mixing with the church-world, what are they if they do?<a name=339:21></a> -- but grace towards it, separating, that early beacon-light to me, the precious from the vile, and they will be as God's mouth.<a name=339:22></a> I repeat, let them in no wise mix with the mixture of church and world -- the meaning of their existence is a testimony against that -- with the earnest gospel energy to souls that Christ may have His own, but the fullest testimony of God's free love (for God would have and delights in that), or it would be as though faithfulness chilled that -- doing the work of evangelists, making full proof of their ministry, humble, lowly and devoted, and simple, because lowly in heart, separated to Christ.<a name=339:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards all the activity outside them, it is one of the signs of the times, and they should rejoice in it -- if Christ were preached of contention, they should, save where they have given occasion to it by failure in themselves, which is possible: but it does not give their testimony at all.<a name=339:24></a> God is sovereign, and can work in love where and as He pleases, and we should rejoice in it; but there is no separation from evil, but the contrary in general.<a name=339:25></a> It is, as to this, just the mixture, which God is bringing out of.<a name=339:26></a> For a year or two, at the beginning, I preached everywhere they let me, and others have done it, but it was, after all, another thing; though the trumpet gave an uncertain sound, it resulted in bringing out, even if the gospel only were fully preached.<a name=339:27></a> Now the question is fully raised, and the testimony has to be clear, yet the fullest preaching of the gospel and of the assurance of salvation.<a name=339:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not believe attacks on anything to be our path, but superior and fuller truth, in grace.<a name=339:29></a> Peter never attacked the chief priests, but went on his own way.<a name=339:30></a> It is a descent from the true high ground of the truth we have of the christian position.<a name=339:31></a> That, and a full gospel used in grace, should distinguish us: the testimony against evil should be in our own walk and ways.<a name=339:32></a> Be assured, when real, it is fully felt.<a name=339:33></a> Occasions may arise where truth is in question; self-defence is every way to be avoided: the Lord will answer for us if we do His will.<a name=339:34></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Union is sought now by indifference to truth, in this country avowedly so, as exchanging pulpits with infidels, and indeed openly everywhere: I say avowedly.<a name=339:35></a> Patiently waiting, where in present darkness it is only ignorance or error, is most necessary; but truth and holiness, love in the truth and for the truth's sake, characterise Christ's revelation of Himself, and His influence in the last days.<a name=339:36></a> God has no need of us, but He has need of a people who walk in the truth in love and holiness.<a name=339:37></a> I find in the Old Testament, "I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of the Lord"; and I find the same spirit in Jude, who speaks of the mixture that would bring on judgment: "But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost, keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.<a name=339:38></a>" The gospel we may, and must, rejoice in, but it only makes the testimony of brethren, outside the camp, more necessary than ever; but it must be real.<a name=339:39></a> May they indeed be waiting for the Lord, and as men that wait for the Lord!<a name=339:40></a> His love is not wanting.<a name=339:41></a> May we, in earnest love to Him, be waiting for Him, because we do so love Him, and be found watching!<a name=339:42></a> .<a name=339:43></a>.<a name=339:44></a> I thought of writing to you, dear brother, not having heard of you for a long while, and my thoughts flowed on, for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.<a name=339:45></a> Now I cannot doubt the work -- at least, the testimony -- is going on.<a name=339:46></a> The way it is telling, though only as a sowing-time, and what I hear and know of Europe, have partly led me to this train of thought for it presses just now on my mind.<a name=339:47></a> May the beloved brethren be found of Him in peace, and watching; devotedness maintained and increased; their whole body, soul and spirit, be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ!<a name=339:48></a>

		I have just published another tract on perfectionism at Boston.<a name=339:49></a> Error, from Germany, is largely mixed up with active religious minds here: I have written on it, but I do not know what I shall do with it; but the subject calls for watchfulness.<a name=339:50></a> The brethren are getting on happily here, and with blessing and I hope roused up and cheered, with some nice persons added in Boston.<a name=339:51></a> There has been some blessing outside too .<a name=339:52></a>.<a name=339:53></a>.<a name=339:54></a> .<a name=339:55></a> Let me hear of yourself.<a name=339:56></a>

		[C Crain] DEAR BROTHER, -- I thought probably baptism was on the mind of -- ; with him it would be taking on the responsibility of a Christian, and till he fully knows grace this would be a difficulty when a man is conscientious, so one would wait, only putting the grace clearly before him.<a name=343:1></a> But in his case it should surely come first: it is the just order, and for the above reason not without its moral bearing.<a name=343:2></a> But at any rate it would be the just order.<a name=343:3></a> We must come into the house, naturally, before we sit down to the table in the house, though the Lord's supper is the expression of the unity of the body, and by one Spirit we are baptised into one body, and with that baptism has nothing directly to do.<a name=343:4></a> Only as I said, it is the natural order, and his own soul's state has to be considered in connection with it, not to slip in easy, though I do not think he is inclined to that.<a name=343:5></a>

		I have been down to Vineland, where I thought all was broken up, but there are four steadily breaking bread, so that the testimony is there, and I suspect on more solid ground than ever.<a name=343:6></a> But it is only a testimony just born.<a name=343:7></a> -- walks, as does his wife, in most patient grace in trying circumstances.<a name=343:8></a> Whether it is that my heart sees more what ought to be I know not, but I feel more deeply daily the utter ruin Christendom lies in all round.<a name=343:9></a> It is a narrow path to keep from the evil -- unspotted from the world, and yet in the full grace of divine love towards all.<a name=343:10></a> Here the work is to do, some twenty souls walking blamelessly, but no action outside.<a name=343:11></a> But if God opens the door there is no difficulty with Him.<a name=343:12></a> We are poor instruments, but He is able to do anything.<a name=343:13></a>

		MY DEAR BROTHER, -- Not quite at the end till I turn round towards England again, the Lord sparing me, and holding me up.<a name=349:1></a> I have just made ninety-six hours of railroad without stopping, and am all well.<a name=349:2></a> My mind fully turns to England when I have done in these parts.<a name=349:3></a> Were I young, with (humanly speaking) life before me, there would be ground for staying, for the work is opening.<a name=349:4></a> It is in many respects on a new footing, and the question of this position and the truths of scripture as to the full position, and the walk too, of the Christian is round everywhere.<a name=349:5></a> But I am not young, and cannot think to carry out the work myself; and God, I trust, will raise up instruments, as He has a few.<a name=349:6></a> It is not His mind, I believe, to take out of weakness.<a name=349:7></a> In the state of the church it becomes us to take part in her sorrows.<a name=349:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards your first question, I think there is a mistake as to the position of the assembly, both in the sister and also of the brother who objected, perhaps in all.<a name=349:9></a> When persons break bread, they are in the only fellowship I know -- owned members of the body of Christ.<a name=349:10></a> The moment you make another full fellowship, you make people members of your assembly, and the whole principle of meeting is falsified.<a name=349:11></a> The assembly has to be satisfied as to the persons, but, as so receiving to break bread, is supposed to be satisfied on the testimony of the person introducing them, who is responsible to the assembly in this respect.<a name=349:12></a> This, or two or three visiting, is to me the question of adequate testimony to the conscience of the assembly.<a name=349:13></a> At the beginning it was not so, that is, there was no such examination.<a name=349:14></a> Now I believe it a duty according to 2 Timothy 2.<a name=349:15></a> Nobody comes in but as a believer.<a name=349:16></a> This again makes the distinction of member of the particular assembly.<a name=349:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Still, I do not think a practice such as this sister's is satisfactory.<a name=349:18></a> I admit fully every case must stand on its own merits, and so be dealt with.<a name=349:19></a> Where breaking bread is intermitted, it is all well to mention it, though this be in some cases uncalled for, where the assembly knows about it and is satisfied.<a name=349:20></a> But if persons break bread, they are as subject to discipline as if always there, because it is the church of God which is in question, though represented by two or three: Christ is there.<a name=349:21></a> If it is merely an occasional coming as a stranger, and the person not known, it is well to mention.<a name=349:22></a> What is not satisfactory in such cases is: first, it is accepting the person by the assembly as if he had another fellowship besides membership of Christ, which I do not recognise at all.<a name=349:23></a> And, secondly, I should fear there was a reluctance to take honestly the reproach of the position, the true separated position of saints, and [the wish] to be able to say to others, I do not belong to them, I only go as a believer: I only go as a believer, only I accept the position.<a name=349:24></a> Waiting for them to get clear is all well.<a name=349:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A true believer has <i>title</i> at the Table; but if they meet as members of Christ's body, they are all one body, as partakers of one loaf.<a name=349:26></a> I do not admit them.<a name=349:27></a> I own their title, wait upon their want of light, but would not allow them to put me in the position of a sect (and, 'full fellowship,' means that), making allowance for their ignorance and waiting upon it.<a name=349:28></a> They do not come really to break bread with us on the ground of the unity of the body, if they think they are not one with us in coming; for if we are true and right, they are not one with the body of Christ, the only principle of meeting I know at all.<a name=349:29></a> I repeat, in the present state of the church we must have patience, as their minds have been moulded in church membership; but I ought not to falsify my own position, nor sanction it in the mind of another.<a name=349:30></a> If the person is known to all, and known to be there to break bread, all mention is needless; it is a testimony to the unity of the body: if an occasional thing, the person who introduces is responsible.<a name=349:31></a> I remember a case, where one growing in truth came to help sometimes in a Sunday school, and from the other side of London, and asked the brethren if he might not break bread when there -- time even did not allow of him to get back to his Baptist service -- and he enjoyed the communion of saints.<a name=349:32></a> The brethren allowed him gladly; and, if my recollection is right, his name was not given out when he came afterwards.<a name=349:33></a> Very soon he was amongst brethren entirely, but his fellowship was as full when he was not: and had he given occasion, he would have been refused in discipline, just as if there every Sunday.<a name=349:34></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The other question is for me a more delicate one, because it is a question of the state of the soul, as of the church, when darkness covers it.<a name=349:35></a> Many, many souls cry Abba, Father (that is, have the Spirit of adoption) which are clear in nothing, save that their confidence is in Christ and His work only: and as doubting is taught in the church, and a plain full gospel unknown, and even rejected by teachers, this state is the natural consequence; and it often requires spirituality to discern the real state of a soul, if really under law undelivered or legalised by teaching.<a name=349:36></a> Hard cold knowledge of doctrine is not what I seek.<a name=349:37></a> Then there is the danger of throwing back a soul just when it wants to be encouraged.<a name=349:38></a> Doubts brought in by conflict, when a soul can really say Abba, are not a ground of rejection, though it shews a soul not well established.<a name=349:39></a> But a soul exercised, but not yet resting in Christ's work, is not in a right state for communion.<a name=349:40></a> So with young converts: it is far better for them to wait until they have peace, only carefully shewing it is not to reject them, bus for their own good.<a name=349:41></a> I should not look for understanding deliverance, but being personally able to say Abba, Father.<a name=349:42></a> The intelligence of deliverance is the consequence of sealing.<a name=349:43></a> But if a man be not sealed, he is not in the christian position: "If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.<a name=349:44></a>" Peace through forgiveness is, as to Christ's work, the evidence of faith in Christ's work, and that work received by faith is the ground of sealing: then one is delivered.<a name=349:45></a> But the intelligence of this is another thing.<a name=349:46></a> Israel, out of Egypt, was brought to God -- delivered.<a name=349:47></a> Through Jordan they entered in, were circumcised, and ate the corn of the land.<a name=349:48></a> But a sealed person alone is in the true christian position; and this is founded on the sprinkling with blood -- that is, faith in Christ's work, by which we have redemption, not in the knowledge of deliverance: that is its effect.<a name=349:49></a>

		MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I know the love of the brethren will like to hear of my arrival here.<a name=352:1></a> I deferred answering your letter till I arrived.<a name=352:2></a> I visited St.<a name=352:3></a> Joseph after Chicago, Alton and St.<a name=352:4></a> Louis.<a name=352:5></a> Thence going on to Omaha, my host at St.<a name=352:6></a> Joseph being superintendent of the rail, I had every advantage to Council Bluffs, opposite Omaha.<a name=352:7></a> There I slept, and then had ninety-six hours in rail to San Francisco, getting out only to eat.<a name=352:8></a> Everything went right, through mercy, and I, taking the sleeping cars, got on perfectly well to San Francisco: but such a desert I never went through: for 200 miles a plot of corn occasionally, then a few small herds of antelopes, and then for some 1,400 miles barrenness, occasionally a solitary rabbit, but an event to see one, occasionally prairie dogs and their burrows, one wolf, not even grass, sage brush and bare ground, emigrant wagons from time to time.<a name=352:9></a> You rise to more than 8,000 feet, the Sierra Nevada woody mountains, some 1,400 miles square, a desert called Rocky Mountains: at Salt Lake the Mormons by irrigation have some poor crops.<a name=352:10></a> I stayed a week or ten days at San Francisco .<a name=352:11></a>.<a name=352:12></a>.<a name=352:13></a> .<a name=352:14></a> There is everywhere work to do.<a name=352:15></a> Thence about 6,000 miles by sea to Auckland, by Honolulu, but the most favourable voyage possible, through mercy, scarcely any sea, and faster than usual, the ship very steady, so that I worked on as usual.<a name=352:16></a> Some little opportunity of testimony though no preaching, so that I was thankful .<a name=352:17></a>.<a name=352:18></a>.<a name=352:19></a> .<a name=352:20></a> We stopped an hour at the Samoan Isles, where were genuine natives as you read of them: the prow of one boat was stove in, and all had to swim, perhaps (if not met) a good mile or more to shore, four or five leaping into the sea as they found the ship leaving -- fine men, of a yellowish red.<a name=352:21></a> There are missionaries there.<a name=352:22></a> Mercy has accompanied us thus far, and surely will.<a name=352:23></a> I have never, since I decided to come here, had a cloud on my mind as to my coming.<a name=352:24></a> All has been without difficulty, and many mercies.<a name=352:25></a> I still doubt that I shall go on to Australia.<a name=352:26></a> It is a week or so farther, and their circumstances are not the same, but the Lord will graciously shew.<a name=352:27></a> My thought is, if spared, to return the way I came.<a name=352:28></a>

		For the States we must look to the Lord to raise up labourers.<a name=355:21></a> I am thankful three brethren have gone to Canada.<a name=355:22></a> I have no doubt that a considerable number have been converted through Moody, but I still judge there were more outside than in.<a name=355:23></a> For conversions, one must be thankful they are saved, but the effect will be to make Christians worldly, and to produce, what is the pest of the United States, the substitution of work for Christ.<a name=355:24></a> I said fifty years ago, when I thought more, and believed perhaps less, that awakenings in Christendom were like water poured out upon the ground, fresh and clear, but after a while it made mud.<a name=355:25></a> I think those not exclusive were in a state prepared for this, this mixture.<a name=355:26></a> There is, I think, a difference as to brethren in this, that what really characterised that work, besides the stirring up devotedness, was the bringing in a mass of biblical truth long hidden, some I believe never current in the historical church.<a name=355:27></a> This, since I reflected on the movement, I have always felt, and as to the substance of it said so: that as the cross and justification by faith were brought out at the Reformation, so the coming of the Holy Ghost uniting us to Christ in heaven, and His coming again, were brought out now: the three positions of Christ as a Saviour -- Christ on the cross, Christ at the right hand of the Father sending the Holy Ghost, Christ coming again to complete the result -- and so the mystery, throwing back immense light upon the value of the cross.<a name=355:28></a> But this blessed unfolding of light spreads, and if there be not devotedness in brethren they become mud like others, and that is the great question now.<a name=355:29></a> "To him that hath shall more be given," otherwise it is just current truth and no more; and indeed that is what Satan is at now, to deaden devotedness among brethren while he spreads truth known at any rate among others.<a name=355:30></a> It produces exclusivism so-called, but exclusivism will not do the work.<a name=355:31></a> Christ who is all -- this must be all.<a name=355:32></a> Activity is all right, but activity instead of Christ -- and that is Moodyism and United States religion -- is a most deadening and worldly-making principle.<a name=355:33></a> The stir gone, the worldliness remains, and the world despises it.<a name=355:34></a> Kindest love to all the dear brethren.<a name=355:35></a> I shall be glad to see them all again, and most thankful for many prayers.<a name=355:36></a>

		As to the first question -- I dread questions, notions -- I believe the body is redeemed, the Lord for the body and the body for the Lord, and that He holds it by His power for resurrection glory -- some changed consequently without dying; but death and corruption in themselves are the effect of sin and Satan's power.<a name=356:18></a> But the body is not under his power; Christ has the keys of death and hell.<a name=356:19></a> Its state is the fruit of his power, but it is through redemption not in his power: only redemption is not yet applied to it in its effect in power.<a name=356:20></a> We are waiting for the redemption of the body.<a name=356:21></a> But the redemption-price is paid, and the power belongs to Christ, is His, so that Satan has no title over it.<a name=356:22></a>

		[G Alexander] BELOVED BROTHER, -- I was glad to get a few lines from you, and to hear something of brethren too.<a name=358:1></a> I have never had a cloud on my mind as to my path, since I fixed to come, the Lord helping me, to New Zealand.<a name=358:2></a> As to my strength, I found it after ninety-six hours constantly in the train that dreary wilderness, nothing the worse: the voyage rather a rest, having as a whole very fine weather, and the ship unusually easy; and were I health-hunting, I might stay in this beautiful country with pleasure.<a name=358:3></a> The climate is admirable here, and the locality charming.<a name=358:4></a> Of course I have been, through mercy, working as elsewhere.<a name=358:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having been put off before, and dear W.<a name=358:6></a> having been here, I had doubts about coming; but as they still looked for me, I thought I should come, and all has been ordered.<a name=358:7></a> I do not know when I have had such earnest and attentive congregations.<a name=358:8></a> The word is enjoyed, so that I trust there may be blessing for all outside as well as inside .<a name=358:9></a>.<a name=358:10></a>.<a name=358:11></a> and the Lord has been graciously with me.<a name=358:12></a> Of course the exercises of soul in others, and in oneself, are found, and practically the same as everywhere; still it remains joyfully and thankfully true that God has wrought us for the selfsame thing, and has given us the earnest of the Spirit.<a name=358:13></a> On the whole, all hitherto has been encouraging, and I trust will be so yet.<a name=358:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I feel sometimes a little envious of those called to be evangelists -- still happy that they have it -- but it is good for me and keeps me low; and I know and feel that I should be willing to serve where He sets me, and rejoice to do it, because it is His will -- only pray I may serve thoroughly, happy to be allowed to do it.<a name=358:15></a> As to all the translations, though very thankful to give the word of God to others, I feel I am only a "hewer of wood and drawer of water" -- always have.<a name=358:16></a> It is a joy to me to have been permitted to do it, but it is the word in the soul which is the power of life.<a name=358:17></a> I only hope in the midst of all that is going on, the brethren may be devoted, and continue to evangelise, and increase in it, but earnestly, soberly and devotedly.<a name=358:18></a> I am not (though I am sure the Lord does all things well) entirely at ease as to the way Moody sets all to work.<a name=358:19></a> I have seen the insecure lowering of Christianity it occasions in America, and the mischief it does to souls, and partly in England; though earnest working, when called of God, and confessing Christ with all, is a great privilege.<a name=358:20></a> But work is made the means of getting peace, openly so, and systematically too, in the States: besides that, many in whom there is no deep work -- yea, because there is not -- set out to work.<a name=358:21></a> Yet I do not deny that where it is deep and simple, one in the freshness of grace and forgiveness can deal better with sinners than one more advanced: I do not speak of positive gifts.<a name=358:22></a> But the setting to work in a superficial state of soul I dread for the person.<a name=358:23></a> I do not doubt that M.<a name=358:24></a>'s setting forth the love of God more freely and fully has done good.<a name=358:25></a> He has got on in truth unquestionably .<a name=358:26></a>.<a name=358:27></a>.<a name=358:28></a> .<a name=358:29></a> As to sects and the church, this question remains just where it was.<a name=358:30></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		My Dear Miss Cottrell, -- I know of no books which give an account of the brethren.<a name=359:1></a> I looked at the account in the -- and I should desire to add, at any rate, my own way of looking at it, so as to express what has governed myself.<a name=359:2></a> One or two expressions might lead I think, though I understand them, to misapprehension.<a name=359:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The great principles which govern me are two, though both flow from one great truth, namely, that the Holy Ghost has been sent down from heaven consequent on the exaltation of the Lord Jesus to the right hand of the Father, witness of His infinite love in redemption and uniting the saints into one body.<a name=359:4></a> This mission, therefore, develops itself in two branches just alluded to: the presence of the Holy Ghost in the church, which He has formed in unity, and in union with its Head, Christ; and His testimony in the midst of the world -- the gospel, in a word, and the church.<a name=359:5></a> This presence of the Holy Ghost down here, as truly sent from above as the Son was (though in a different manner, and consequent on the accomplishment and establishment before God of divine righteousness by Jesus Christ), is the key and centre of all that belongs to the christian state.<a name=359:6></a> Righteousness has been established before God in heaven, and perfect love shewn to the sinner on earth.<a name=359:7></a> Christ has made good both perfect love on God's part towards man in his sins (for God so loved that He spared not His Son), and perfect righteousness for faith before God (for Christ is our righteousness before God).<a name=359:8></a> Of this the Holy Ghost is witness in the gospel (being sent down because Jesus is on high) in the whole creation under heaven.<a name=359:9></a> See 2 Corinthians 5: 19, 20; Colossians 5: 23, where Paul declares what his ministry in the gospel is.<a name=359:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But this gospel gathers the heavenly joint-heirs of Christ, and having gathered them from Jew and Gentile, unites them by the power of His presence into one body, and that as members of Christ in union with the Head.<a name=359:11></a> God had made Him "to be Head over all things to the church which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.<a name=359:12></a>" "By one Spirit we have all been baptised into one body.<a name=359:13></a>" "We are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.<a name=359:14></a>" Hence the saint is the temple of the Holy Ghost individually (1 Corinthians 6: 19); and the whole body collectively.<a name=359:15></a> (1 Corinthians 3: 16.<a name=359:16></a>) Hence on earth they are "builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.<a name=359:17></a>" (Ephesians 2: 20.<a name=359:18></a>) "Ye are the body of Christ and members in particular.<a name=359:19></a>" Hence Paul is also a minister of the church "to complete the word of God.<a name=359:20></a>" The unity of the whole body is to be kept in the bond of peace: and if men and the influence of corruptions have scattered the members of Christ, or substituted another unity or organisation for the unity of the body, the duty is not set aside by that, whatever power we may lack to accomplish it; meanwhile the promise remains sure, wherever two or three are gathered together in Christ's name, He is in the midst of them.<a name=359:21></a> They enjoy His presence as really, if not as completely, as if all the church were gathered together.<a name=359:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ministry, though coming directly from God by the power of the Holy Ghost, and making him that possesses the gift of it thereby the servant of Christ (1 Corinthians 12, Romans 12, 1 Peter 4), yet is exercised by each as a member of the body, while his responsibility is to the Head -- saving needed discipline exercised by the church in Christ's name -- each member filling up the service which belongs to it according to the will of Christ, and the power of the Holy Ghost working in it.<a name=359:23></a> It is exercised in the world by the evangelist -- to say nothing here of the original work of the apostles -- and in the body by pastors, teachers, and the like.<a name=359:24></a> The gifts which were signs to the world have disappeared, but not those by which Christ gathers and nourishes His church.<a name=359:25></a> He cannot cease to call and bless it.<a name=359:26></a> All Christians are members of the body.<a name=359:27></a> Sinners, by evangelists' work or other means, may become Christians.<a name=359:28></a> It is the working of God's love, founded on accomplished righteousness, in virtue of which that love can flow effectually forth to the chief of sinners, and is addressed to the whole world; and scattered saints, wherever placed, may be brought into unity by the power of the Holy Ghost working to this end by light and love.<a name=359:29></a> Nothing but what constitutes a person member of the body of Christ, can be the ground of union; but in union the 'whole will and truth of God is to be maintained in truth, holiness, and grace, according to the word and by the power of the Spirit.<a name=359:30></a> If through ignorance anything not constituting a person a known and recognised member of Christ cannot be settled, saints must forbear, and God will reveal it, while such is the ground of communion.<a name=359:31></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe it is of the last importance that the church should have a right hope.<a name=359:32></a> That hope is, the coming of the Lord to take the saints, already called, into glory with Himself, the church taking her place as the bride, the Lamb's wife.<a name=359:33></a> Consequent upon this He will set aside the power of evil and establish the kingdom in power, blessing and glory.<a name=359:34></a> The nominal church, not members of Christ, will be spued out of His mouth: Babylon judged, as well as all power of evil set aside: full communion and glory for the church with Christ, and the judgment and then blessing of the world as that which we ought to look for.<a name=359:35></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to life: that eternal life which was with the Father has been manifested to us in Christ, and He is become our life.<a name=359:36></a> His precepts, walk and words, in which it was expressed in Him, become the rule and direction of that life in us.<a name=359:37></a> This is the rule, the Spirit is the power.<a name=359:38></a> God has given to us eternal life, and that life is in the Son; and "He that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.<a name=359:39></a>" Hence, through the Spirit, since it is in the Son, we have fellowship with the Son, and therefore with the Father.<a name=359:40></a> Inasmuch as this life is in Christ in the power of resurrection, we shall never fully have our place and glory till we are risen, though to depart and be with Him be far better.<a name=359:41></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The presence of the Holy Ghost, and the coming of the Lord, are the practical hinge of the true character and position of the church.<a name=359:42></a> The great orthodox truths I do not touch upon as I receive them as all true Christians do.<a name=359:43></a> I only speak here of what has distinctively governed my course in the professing christian world.<a name=359:44></a> I would add, that the death and resurrection of Christ is the witness of the world being in itself wholly lost "All were dead" -- and of the founding of the working of God's love towards the lost on the ground of the righteousness established before God in Christ, the Second Adam, so that it is to a new creation we belong as Christians.<a name=359:45></a> But the presence of the Holy Ghost forming the unity of the body, I feel to be the centre and keystone of the whole doctrine of Christ, now exalted on high, till He comes again in glory.<a name=359:46></a> I have seen as to the manifestation of that unity, all ruined and scattered and even an immense system established under its name which is not it.<a name=359:47></a> Hence the difficulty of obtaining the realisation of the blessings connected with it.<a name=359:48></a> But this difficulty has not altered the duty of the saint, nor is the love or power of the Head, nor His interest in the blessing of His saints diminished or enfeebled.<a name=359:49></a> And the Christian is bound, according to the grace given to him, to seek souls in the world in the testimony of God's love and righteousness, and the unity of the body, in all patience, and the edification of all its members for the building of it up, in dependence on the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=359:50></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such are the great principles of scripture on these points as I understand them.<a name=359:51></a> The account in the -- might lead to suppose, that the work known under the name of brethren was a mere abstraction of persons, already believers, from other bodies; whereas, in England, the greater number are converted to God from a state of worldliness, and abroad nearly all have been so.<a name=359:52></a>

		As regards the subject of your letter -- evangelising, I should assuredly seek to serve in and promote in every way I could.<a name=364:4></a> And I can quite understand that an assembly, not having one gifted to preach, but desirous to reach souls in the love of them, seeks that it may be carried on, and helps those who do, and -- I mean if the door be open in the place -- where they are.<a name=364:5></a> But I do not reckon as scriptural 'our evangelist.<a name=364:6></a>' The evangelist is the Lord's servant only, though the sympathy of brethren is most happy and desirable.<a name=364:7></a> It is just the old denominational plan, so -- 'the assembly sought him to preach the gospel for them.<a name=364:8></a>'
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The meeting of a few caring for the saints and serving them, is very desirable, but they cannot act as the assembly, though they may serve it in every way.<a name=364:9></a> This question has arisen in New Zealand.<a name=364:10></a> They had got into this habit; so that the conscience of the assembly as such was not exercised.<a name=364:11></a> It may be the means, if godly care of souls be carried on by those so meeting, of sparing the assembly many harassing details: but where the conscience of the assembly is concerned, there the matter must be before the assembly, that the conscience of the assembly may be right before God.<a name=364:12></a> This habit of a few judging for the assembly (nominally giving notice to gather brothers) has become pretty general in N.<a name=364:13></a>Z.<a name=364:14></a>, resulting in leaving it to two or three, often to one of more active mind; but we have the matter before us, that the conscience of the assembly may be in exercise when it is called for.<a name=364:15></a> In putting away it is always so, though in investigating and getting the real moral bearings of the case, grave godly brethren may be most useful here too.<a name=364:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have no doubt that the case at -- is a proof of the mischief of opening the door in this way because the person naturally acquires influence, and all becomes loose; but 'our evangelist' is itself a mere dissenting church position, and does not recognise gifts in the body, each in its own place serving the Lord according to the grace given .<a name=364:17></a>.<a name=364:18></a>.<a name=364:19></a> .<a name=364:20></a>

		Dear J Leslie, -- I have had your letter a long time on my table waiting for a seasonable [moment] to write, not as to mere time, but to give you some real news of what was going on here.<a name=365:1></a> It has been going on so evenly from day to day that there was little to relate.<a name=365:2></a> It has never been God's way to give me much apparent present effect of work: it was good for me, I doubt not, to be kept doing it as work to Him.<a name=365:3></a> Besides, very often there was nothing very positive.<a name=365:4></a> In a few places I have had manifest blessing in evangelising, but my faith and courage are feeble in looking for present fruits; only I am willing to serve the Lord and His saints -- I hope I can say to be nothing, if He is everything; and we are nothing, but if God gives one to serve, it is a wonderful mercy.<a name=365:5></a> I have gone on here just labouring as the opportunity served and the door was open.<a name=365:6></a> I have some hope that it has cheered and strengthened and refreshed them .<a name=365:7></a>.<a name=365:8></a>.<a name=365:9></a> .<a name=365:10></a>

		Dear Mr Pollock, -- I see I shall hardly get away before winter, I might start during the winter, but that I should hardly choose unless duty calls.<a name=376:1></a> I have been kept longer in Canada than I thought, for my object was the States.<a name=376:2></a> We have had two conferences, both blessed; in the first, out of town, more enjoyment of communion, perhaps; in the second, in Montreal, more instruction -- a good many fresh from the States.<a name=376:3></a> But another thing kept me awhile: the loose gatherings which emigrants and others have formed have been nearly broken among themselves, and several were desirous of coming into communion; and the local brethren, many of them little informed of the facts, were glad of help; and I have been occupied in two or three places with that disagreeable but useful work.<a name=376:4></a> Many have seen what it is all about, and are clear, and a good many have come in.<a name=376:5></a> I have always found that knowing the blasphemies that were really in question has dissipated the fog they had managed to produce in many minds there was real conscientiousness.<a name=376:6></a> The older gatherings been sadly neglected.<a name=376:7></a> This I have a little attended to also, and all this kept me, and I have not done yet.<a name=376:8></a> Meanwhile, conversions continue .<a name=376:9></a>.<a name=376:10></a>.<a name=376:11></a>

		[H H McCarthy] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- As regards -- , I do not pretend to judge of the matter with the knowledge I have of the facts.<a name=382:1></a> There are many things to think of in such cases; people may be wrong, yet not wisely dealt with.<a name=382:2></a> Do you be calm and leave it to the Lord.<a name=382:3></a> He knows how to justify us where judgment is unrighteous, and shew us our wrong where we have failed; and, with Him, the rest is of very little matter.<a name=382:4></a> I rather object to brothers being called in to settle things.<a name=382:5></a> I quite recognise that we are all one, and that brethren in an assembly can seek, and have a right to, the assistance of any brother who is a man of counsel in communion with the Lord.<a name=382:6></a> But it must be getting the conscience of the assembly right, not settling it for them; for if the other be not done, nothing is really settled.<a name=382:7></a> So Paul acted.<a name=382:8></a> And we must have patience to separate the precious from the vile.<a name=382:9></a> The great thing is to get the consciences of all fully before God.<a name=382:10></a> There are those who did not go with those who condemned you, but you must not lean on this, but condemn yourself wherever God does not approve your way of acting.<a name=382:11></a> Never mind, if others have made mistakes.<a name=382:12></a> It is one of the chief sorrows of one's christian life.<a name=382:13></a> But God is above all, and always right, and will bring out things as they ought to be, without us, and so best.<a name=382:14></a> It puts us in our place of nothingness -- our true place.<a name=382:15></a> The church of God has failed; but God only the more glorified, and the Lord, in it; and so in us.<a name=382:16></a> Even in details, Paul could say, "I stand in doubt of you," and then, "I have confidence in you through the Lord.<a name=382:17></a>" We ought to be all perfect, but we are not, and if we are, the church is not, so God cannot unfold and display all His goodness and glory in it.<a name=382:18></a> I know nothing more sad than the end of Acts; yet Paul could say, "This shall turn to my salvation," and "the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel.<a name=382:19></a>" And I have always found reason to humble myself in these cases.<a name=382:20></a> Sorrow is a good thing, and makes God a more abundant source of joy.<a name=382:21></a> Of the present details, I am, of course, in considerable measure ignorant; but God makes everything work together for good to them who love Him.<a name=382:22></a>

		[Mr Spignio] [From the Italian.<a name=386:1></a>] DEAR BROTHER -- It rejoices me much to learn that the faithful Lord has turned your thoughts and your steps in the direction of brethren, or rather, as I believe, of the path appointed by God.<a name=386:2></a> I own fully that it is a question of obedience to the word of God, not of walking with me, or anybody else, but positively to do the will of God.<a name=386:3></a> At first, when I left the Episcopal church, there was no one with whom I could walk; I was led on and guided simply by the word of God.<a name=386:4></a> Afterwards four of us met together; I thought only of satisfying my conscience according to the word of God.<a name=386:5></a> The work extended, and that everywhere, and I am deeply convinced that it is a testimony which God Himself has raised up for these last days.<a name=386:6></a> I have been walking in this way for fifty years; I have seen weakness in myself, and mistakes, I do not doubt, in the way of walking; but I have never doubted for a moment that it is the work of God.<a name=386:7></a> But it is needful that each one should be convinced of this for himself by the word of God.<a name=386:8></a> It is a path of faith, and faith only can sustain the soul in this path; but I know that the peace, the approval of God are there; and those who walk in it by faith are made happy by them.<a name=386:9></a> I hope that my love for the brethren with whom I cannot walk will be always increasing.<a name=386:10></a> We cannot realise the blessings which belong to us if we do not comprehend all the saints in our christian affections.<a name=386:11></a> (Ephesians 3: 18.<a name=386:12></a>) Not to walk with them in a path that is not according to the word is not saying that one does not love them, but just the contrary.<a name=386:13></a> I want no more than this, that you should search the word of God in His presence, and He will certainly guide you.<a name=386:14></a> Glad as I should be to find you in the path which I believe to be that of God, I shall not cease to love you, even though you should condemn me: it is a delight to me to know that God has blessed you in your labours amongst these dear souls in Italy.<a name=386:15></a>

		It was the unity of the assembly of God, of those who are united to Christ by the Holy Ghost, which forced me to leave the Anglican church, and prevented me from joining any other; and I have found in the word of God all the directions needed for walking according to the will of God, amid the ruin and confusion which surrounds us.<a name=386:16></a> I own then every true Christian as a member of the body of Christ, but I cannot walk with them when they do not walk according to the will of God, according to the word.<a name=386:17></a> May our God bless your soul, and your labours, and may He lead you in the path of Christ and of faith, the "good and acceptable and perfect will of God"!<a name=386:18></a> He is blessing the work in this place; many are sounding the word, and the expectation of the Lord is continually on the increase.<a name=386:19></a>

		[Mr Brockhaus] [From the German.<a name=394:26></a>] DEAR BROTHER, -- I have long delayed answering your affectionate letter, not at all from indifference, but from press of work.<a name=394:27></a> Three meetings as a rule daily, long journeys, together with correspondence which required attention because it concerned the state of assemblies, and that for six weeks, and also because of the infidelity which has appeared in the Free Church, articles having been sent me that I might write on the subject and offer some opposition.<a name=394:28></a> Finally I was quite overcome and wearied by work.<a name=394:29></a> I now purpose to depart for Europe on Saturday, God willing, embarking at Quebec, and if God in His unfailing goodness grant a quiet passage, I hope to obtain some rest.<a name=394:30></a> The position of the brethren is in some slight respects altered.<a name=394:31></a> There is an acknowledgment here in the United States of their acquaintance with the word such as nowhere else.<a name=394:32></a> They are not the less opposed to us; but they buy the books, and come in numbers to the Bible readings: they feel they must reckon with us, as they say.<a name=394:33></a> The Presbyterians, the Methodists, the Baptists, are minded to oppose.<a name=394:34></a> The first are unanimous, the ministers, as everywhere, opposing our work, and some write about it: the remainder study much what this (to them) new movement means.<a name=394:35></a> The godly ones are discontented with the sermons, and some, like Moody, endeavour to help by a strenuous effort of activity .<a name=394:36></a>.<a name=394:37></a>.<a name=394:38></a> .<a name=394:39></a> But I let all these movements pass.<a name=394:40></a> The truth is spreading; that truth of the Holy Spirit's presence consequent upon the Lord being glorified, for that He as Son of man, glorified God on the cross; and the coming of the Lord.<a name=394:41></a> These are the fundamental truths of the gospel, based upon the finished work of Christ.<a name=394:42></a> Our controversy is essentially with unbelievers -- that I deeply feel -- and with the thought that the incarnation was a union of the Lord with humanity, the human race; because, on the contrary, it is lost, and our union is with the glorified Man at God's right hand, and thus of believers only through the Holy Ghost.<a name=394:43></a> The two springs are in Germany, but they are spreading in Europe and in America.<a name=394:44></a> But we are at the end of days.<a name=394:45></a> For some time the coming of the Lord has wrought in souls far and wide, and the doctrine is spreading wonderfully.<a name=394:46></a>

		As to "my body which is broken for you"; as "broken" is not, I suppose, in scripture, it is well to avoid it: the bread was clearly broken, and as a sign of death I do not doubt, and the blood taken as shed; and this I think essential to the meaning of the ordinance; nor does the word therefore trouble me, because the sense is true and essential; and I think "a bone of him shall not be broken" misapplied, with you: and I should insist on the thought that it is shed blood, and that the bread should be broken, a sign that it was Christ's death.<a name=397:5></a> It is being given as one in whose life, so to speak, a breach was made by death; and care must be taken in losing the word, that the sense of the thing be not lost.<a name=397:6></a> Criticism in divine things is dangerous ground for the <i>soul</i>, and resting on words where things are in question.<a name=397:7></a> But scripture is wiser than we are, even in language .<a name=397:8></a>.<a name=397:9></a>.<a name=397:10></a> .<a name=397:11></a>

		Dear Miss Coke, -- Mr.<a name=399:1></a> -- 's objection is the common one of loose brethren, but the question is elsewhere than where he has put it.<a name=399:2></a> What does scripture say about it?<a name=399:3></a> Whether men carry out successfully is a grave question for their consciences, but has nothing to do with what is right.<a name=399:4></a> I asked myself this question years and years ago, How if all this should fail?<a name=399:5></a> Well, I said it would prove I was a bad workman as far as I was concerned in it: but there it is in scripture just where it was, and that is what is to govern us.<a name=399:6></a> 1 Corinthians 12.<a name=399:7></a> clearly states this unity of the body on earth.<a name=399:8></a> Besides the whole teaching of scripture.<a name=399:9></a> But the answer as to circumstances is clear.<a name=399:10></a> The ground is not the wisdom of a set of individuals, but the promise that where they are gathered to His name He will be in the midst of them.<a name=399:11></a> And I have always found that respecting the action of an assembly prima facie is the way of wisdom and what God owns.<a name=399:12></a> And Mr.<a name=399:13></a> -- forgets that the fact, that we are all one body, gives the title to communicate and remonstrate if called for, and in an extreme case, where evil is deliberately allowed, to disown the meeting altogether.<a name=399:14></a> The loose brethren have given up the truth of the unity of the body on earth and have gone back into the camp, and are mostly Independents without a regular minister, or merged in a general looseness that has spread everywhere.<a name=399:15></a> But this has not changed the word of God.<a name=399:16></a>

		Dear Mrs J A Trench, -- I believe Hebrews 10<a href="#403:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> is absolute and for ever.<a name=403:1></a> It is a question of imputation and a purged conscience, not of sensibility to failure and confession of it, which is a state of soul connected with communion or fellowship to which 1 John 2 applies.<a name=403:2></a> But here the apostle says if this were not perfecting for ever, eij" to; dihnekev", Christ must often have <i>suffered</i> from the foundation of the world; but He was once offered to bear the sins of many.<a name=403:3></a> And when I go to God, even to confess failure, He is there and all the value of His blood, so that imputation is impossible.<a name=403:4></a> Hence in 1 John 2 we have Jesus Christ the righteous, and He is the propitiation: that is the basis of advocacy.<a name=403:5></a> And the very ground in that part of Hebrews, that the falling into sin is fatal and final drawing back to perdition is, that there is no more sacrifice for sin.<a name=403:6></a> But this for such and for the believer is finished, in there being but one; but then that one for the believer must finally and for ever settle the question, or it never could be.<a name=403:7></a> And this is to the furthering of holiness, because what would be otherwise a question of acceptance and righteousness, is now a question of holiness and walking with God, and present divine favour and communion.<a name=403:8></a> But as to conscience of sins, I cannot go to God and not find Christ there, not without blood, who bore them all; so that it is impossible they can come in question as to imputation, or my conscience be burdened with them as yet unsettled between me and God.<a name=403:9></a> But it makes them doubly hateful as to holiness, that one in the light as God is should do them, and find even momentary pleasure in what made Christ's agony -- but if it did it cannot be imputed.<a name=403:10></a> Numbers 19 is applicable here; the great day of atonement was valid, or he would not have had that, and he was an Israelite.<a name=403:11></a> I believe it to be of great moment to true holiness to know that the worshipper once purged has no more conscience of sins: when He had by Himself purged our sins, He sat down.<a name=403:12></a> It is absolute for the divine glory, eternal in its value and unchangeable, and wholly finished, and eij" to; dihnekev".<a name=403:13></a>

		R F Kingscote, Romans 8<a href="#404:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> takes up the Christian as having died with Christ, and having the Spirit of Christ who is his life.<a name=404:1></a> He is in Christ (verse 1), and Christ in him.<a name=404:2></a> (verse 10) But the Romans, though in the second part (beginning chapter 5: 12) it goes on to the full Christian position in Christ, and Christ in us, never looks at the Christian but as a living man on the earth; not as risen with Christ, which introduces entirely another aspect of the condition, nor does it take up, consequently, union with Christ.<a name=404:3></a> It is only our standing in Him (chapter 8), and He in us our life, and justified; hence "one in us," or members of His body, do not come into view, only it is taken for granted as truth in the hortatory part.<a name=404:4></a> When we speak of risen with Christ, Christ is looked at as a raised and exalted man, not as quickening Son of God, nor exactly our life, but God has raised us with Him.<a name=404:5></a> This is Ephesians, where men are looked at as dead in sins, and it is a new creation.<a name=404:6></a> Romans looks at them as responsibly living in sins, hence death is brought in, as well as removal of guilt: but resurrection is not only that the Christian is alive to God in Christ, but has the Holy Ghost, and so (according to John 14) is in Christ, and Christ in him, as to his standing before God, and state in this world.<a name=404:7></a> But union to the glorified Man is not the subject of Romans.<a name=404:8></a> Of course, if we have the Holy Ghost we are united.<a name=404:9></a> Colossians gives Romans doctrine, adding resurrection with Christ, only it does not go on to setting in Him above: we are risen, but on earth -- hope laid for us in heaven to have our affections there.<a name=404:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		-- forgets that 'resurrection-life' is a term (as a short statement suitable enough) invented by Christians to express the state in which we are, not a scriptural one.<a name=404:11></a> In essence divine life is always the same: only that now Christ, who becomes our life, being not only a quickening Spirit, but also Himself raised from the dead, we have this life as ours according to the condition into which He is entered as man.<a name=404:12></a> In one aspect He quickens whom He will (John 5); in another He is raised from the dead, we are quickened together with Him; and though all this is life in divine power -- Christ our life -- yet the difference is important, and involves a great deal.<a name=404:13></a> It is not only being born, but born as dead to all that is passed as Christ was -- death, sin, Satan's power, and judgment passed, forgiveness and justification possessed.<a name=404:14></a> (Colossians 2: 13, and so Ephesians) It leads to, though it be not in itself, the unity of all saints in the body of Christ.<a name=404:15></a> Hence the connection of life with resurrection with Christ is of all importance, because it is consequent on the death of Christ, and seals on God's part the efficacy of this work, and leads us (the question of sin, and judgment, and the power of flesh and Satan settled) into the new place or sphere to which it belongs.<a name=404:16></a> But the life is always essentially the same, or it could not enjoy God.<a name=404:17></a> But the state of that life is modified by the consciousness of that place into which it is, in all its relationships, brought -- where Christ is, which affects it in all its thoughts and affections, according to the power of the Holy Ghost which is in and with it.<a name=404:18></a> "It is the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus.<a name=404:19></a>" This affects its whole state and condition, in fellowship with God and with Christ; for morally the life lives in that in which it is.<a name=404:20></a> "He that hath the Son hath life," and that Son is the risen Man.<a name=404:21></a>

I mean is there such a thing in this dispensation as being born again without having resurrection-life communicated by the Holy Ghost?

If so, then every one who has life is "in Christ" according to Romans 8: 2, and John 17: 21, "that they may be one in us" (Father and Son). Then would the reception of the spirit, consequent upon believing, and the knowledge of forgiveness, unite us to the glorified Man at God's right hand the first, in John 20, receiving life from Christ as a divine power, and the second the Holy Spirit uniting us to Christ as man? <p> 'Would it be right to say that an individual was baptised into the body?

		[W Easton] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- My thought has always been to connect baptism ecclesiastically with the house, one of the two characters of the assembly.<a name=411:1></a> (Ephesians 1, 2, and elsewhere.<a name=411:2></a>) As a general thing, the house and the kingdom now have the same limits, though not strictly; so that I have not made any difficulty about people saying it, but the ideas are quite different.<a name=411:3></a> I was not aware of having connected baptism with the kingdom; I have never published anything upon it, but carefully abstained from it.<a name=411:4></a> Some private letters were privately printed.<a name=411:5></a> I have used Matthew 18 as shewing the way the Lord recognised little children as objects of divine favour, and that of such was the kingdom, and thus giving a warrant for our receiving them, as also the children being holy in 1 Corinthians; but not as speaking directly of baptism, only that was one way of so owning them.<a name=411:6></a> The house itself is only a figure, though a scriptural one, as where the Holy Ghost dwells.<a name=411:7></a> The Quakers as to formal order are not in the house, but that does not hinder the sovereign pleasure of God, as in the case of Cornelius -- thereupon he was received: but baptism is only the formal and orderly entrance into the place of privilege.<a name=411:8></a> The hundred and twenty were never baptised at all, that scripture speaks of, and could not be.<a name=411:9></a>

		[J S Oliphant] DEAREST BROTHER, -- Discipline is not merely for restoration, though it be one object.<a name=414:1></a> It is to keep the Table pure.<a name=414:2></a> It is sometimes a very delicate question to settle whether the individual is so thoroughly restored as that the conscience of the assembly is not engaged, and that specially in a recent case.<a name=414:3></a> An old case, where I was thoroughly convinced the person was, I should not bring up, and clearly not where it was before conversion, unless in some special circumstances .<a name=414:4></a>.<a name=414:5></a>.<a name=414:6></a> .<a name=414:7></a> If 'there were serious evidences' against genuine repentance, clearly these few should not have taken it on themselves.<a name=414:8></a> There seems to have been effort in this case all through to conceal it -- a bad sign.<a name=414:9></a> Bringing up evil needlessly is a bad thing, it defiles: but without -- at this distance, or hearing those concerned -- pretending to judge the case, I confess there seems here to have been, where the consciences of many were engaged, an effort to screen more than to purify.<a name=414:10></a> The assembly remains pure, as it has not been engaged in it.<a name=414:11></a> If it has cognisance of it, it has to decide if it be satisfied with the report of these four.<a name=414:12></a> If not, it must take the case up.<a name=414:13></a> Bringing out sin is neither grace nor purity, but slurring it over is not the way of blessing to an assembly.<a name=414:14></a>

		A decision taken by a few brothers for the assembly may become a frightful tyranny, and does not purify the conscience of the assembly.<a name=416:12></a> <i>All</i> the brothers may have united for a matter of discipline, I allow; but after all, the investigation, if any is needed, is made by a few -- only, a few can neither exercise the discipline, nor pronounce the excision: it would not be 1 Corinthians 5: 13, nor 2 Corinthians 7: 11.<a name=416:13></a> The object of the apostle was to awaken the conscience of the assembly.<a name=416:14></a> The best thing is that a few grave brothers should make themselves acquainted with the facts, assuring themselves of the assent of the brethren who have most weight in the assembly, and that then the matter being ripe, should be brought before it; only, let there be full liberty for all the brothers, if need be, to make their observations.<a name=416:15></a> If nothing is said, the matter is concluded; if any grave brother has difficulties, they wait: if it is only ill-temper, the assembly judges it, and passes on; if it cannot do so it is then the state of the assembly which demands attention.<a name=416:16></a> When the brothers who are acquainted with the facts have judged excision to be necessary, there remains only to present to the assembly the conclusion which has been arrived at, and if nothing is said, the thing is done.<a name=416:17></a> Experience has taught me to fear the rule of individuals as much as the jealousy of a radical spirit; the conscience of all must be exercised, and the business of the individual is to awaken it, as that of the Corinthians was awakened by the first epistle of Paul.<a name=416:18></a>

		[F S Monk] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- My answer<a href="#417:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> has been delayed by incessant occupation.<a name=417:12></a> The state spoken of in Romans 5: 12 to the end of chapter 8 is, though founded on faith, experimental, and carefully made so; the former, save as owning guilt, is not so.<a name=417:13></a> The two parts are quite distinct.<a name=417:14></a> The Holy Ghost is given, as a general truth, on believing; but this supposes "the gospel of your salvation," and if we look into details we shall find, as in Acts 2, that the sealing is on forgiveness -- that is, the work, as well as the Person of Christ; which is confirmed by Acts 10: 43.<a name=417:15></a> Romans 5 states the whole condition of the Christian as saved by grace up to joying in God, and there the Holy Ghost is given to us.<a name=417:16></a> From verse 12, we have not guilt, forgiveness, justification and grace, but "by one man's disobedience the many are constituted sinners," and what is taught is to reckon ourselves dead with Christ, He having died to sin once.<a name=417:17></a> But this does apply to our state and experience, though faith be the means: "I know that in me .<a name=417:18></a>.<a name=417:19></a>.<a name=417:20></a> dwelleth no good thing.<a name=417:21></a>" It is self-knowledge; and this is by the use of the law, as leading through the consciousness of lust to the knowledge of what I am, what the tree is.<a name=417:22></a> Hence, as a general principle, it must be experience, and this self-knowledge God would have, that there may be depth and reality in the state of the heart.<a name=417:23></a> The only point to remark here is that, as its principle is law (that is the reference of our standing to our state, and not to sovereign grace and Christ, whether dying for our sins, or our own being in Him), it is discussed by the apostle on the pure ground of law.<a name=417:24></a> But the question of forgiveness does not arise, but of sin in the flesh, disposed of in chapter 8: 2, 3.<a name=417:25></a> But the person in chapter vii.<a name=417:26></a> is not looked at as sealed, but as under law, and the point is absence of power, and an evil nature to which we are captive.<a name=417:27></a> If, in point of fact, we have known forgiveness, and afterwards discover our weakness and the power of sin, it takes the shape of, 'I trust I have not deceived myself; I thought I was set free and happy.<a name=417:28></a>' This does arise where there has been revival preaching, and no depth of conviction, or exercise of conscience; or where the soul is suddenly made free by the gospel -- without knowing itself, without having been under the law, exercised under it previously -- merely that it could not answer for sins in the judgment, not its lost estate.<a name=417:29></a> It has to learn that under the law it cannot succeed, and gets, not forgiveness for what it has done as a child of Adam (and in this case it goes no farther than sins previously committed), but Christ, and being in Him instead of itself, a new place and standing; not a purging of the conscience as to what was previous, but a change of place before God.<a name=417:30></a> Now this is not known till we have discovered that we have no power; and if we have the knowledge of the forgiveness of past sins up to the time of faith, this is not the knowledge of our place in Christ, nor even of our place out of Him; for this, we must learn what is passed through in Romans vii.<a name=417:31></a> The Hebrews teaches us the purging of conscience, and perfecting for ever by one offering.<a name=417:32></a> This, though it goes further than past sins, does not give us a place in Christ, which connects our living state and our no condemnation -- acceptance.<a name=417:33></a> This is known by the Comforter given to us (John 14), we in Christ, and Christ in us.<a name=417:34></a> This is not membership in the body, but our individual place before God; it is fully developed in both parts in Romans 8.<a name=417:35></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are sealed when we believe in Christ for the forgiveness of sins; but when it is only a clearing of conscience as to past sins, we have to learn afterwards what we are, the state being vague and uncertain as to the present: the forgiveness of what is actually on the conscience is real, but goes no further.<a name=417:36></a> If I have learned my weakness by a legal process before, I find myself in Christ, through grace in Christ, and my whole case is clear.<a name=417:37></a> The church having in its ordinary gospel neither this, nor even Hebrews 9, 10, is at a loss to know what to do when sin recurs.<a name=417:38></a> It is absolution, looking back to baptism (Calvin), re-sprinkling with the blood of Christ -- all the ignoring that "by one offering, he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.<a name=417:39></a>" But it is by the Holy Ghost given we know that we are in Christ; and this is in contrast with law (see 2 Corinthians 3), and connected with the knowledge of God's righteousness.<a name=417:40></a> The forgiveness of past sins is not being in a forgiven condition; were it not complete as to the work, Christ must often suffer: and if sealed thereon, we have to learn -- in a modified form perhaps -- complete forgiveness, "Blessed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity," learnt after forgiveness when that is only of the past -- relieving, but not purging fully, the conscience.<a name=417:41></a> Being sealed, we get into a wholly new standing, and conflicts where we did not succeed looked back on; for that is the true character of Romans 7 -- the estimate of it, "we know" (verse 14) when we are out of it, and at liberty through the presence of the Holy Ghost, who, being present, makes us know our place in Christ, and Christ in us.<a name=417:42></a> But forgiveness as to the past is different from "imputes no sin.<a name=417:43></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As a general truth then, sealing takes place when we believe -- but believe the gospel as preached by Paul, "the gospel of your salvation.<a name=417:44></a>" Present forgiveness is a true and blessed thing; but, as at present preached, it is only administrative forgiveness, thus Jewish forgiveness, with which Christian is contrasted in Hebrews, in Romans 4, as in Acts 13, "By him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.<a name=417:45></a>" Being in Christ is yet another thing, known, with other blessings, through the Holy Ghost given to us.<a name=417:46></a> But even forgiveness is, "Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.<a name=417:47></a>" Where a soul is, is a matter of spiritual discernment.<a name=417:48></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#417:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>'When does sealing take place in the soul's history, and in what relation does it stand, if any, to experience (Romans 7) and deliverance (Romans 8)? <p>'Where, as to time, in the history of the soul, does Romans vii. come in? For if antecedent to sealing, peace, and hope of glory, it makes experience a condition precedent to being sealed. If, on the other hand, the experience of Romans 7 follows Romans 5: 1, 2, and Ephesians 1: 13, you have a soul who is sealed with the Holy Ghost (and this I thought was power) finding out that he has no power at all, and longing for deliverance. <p>'"Having believed ye were sealed" (Ephesians 1: 13); is it necessary for anything to come in between these two, or does not sealing rather follow immediately the reception of God's testimony as to Christ's work?'

		[W Hooke] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I do not like the style of the tract<a href="#420:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> I confess; it is what we call in French a style <i>ampoul</i> (I do not use a hard English word), but sets out to say wonderful things in a wonderful way.<a name=420:1></a> But to doubt that Christ is glorified, is to doubt the plainest passages of scripture.<a name=420:2></a> See John 13: 31, 32; 17: 5; 1 Timothy 3: 16, and practically many passages, if the word glory be not used, as 1 Peter 3: 22; Acts 2: 33.<a name=420:3></a> The passage the tract alludes to is plain enough too, Ephesians 1: 20-23.<a name=420:4></a> John 7: 39 is specific in its statement: the Comforter could not come till Jesus was glorified; but He is come according to promise.<a name=420:5></a> John 12: 16 is equally definite.<a name=420:6></a> I might go on citing passages in numbers, for it lies at the basis of Christianity, but it is hardly necessary after these.<a name=420:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a mistake to deny actual union with Christ.<a name=420:8></a> It is true that it is not a material union of flesh, but Spirit is as real, and more real than flesh, though not material.<a name=420:9></a> "Of his flesh and of his bones" should not be insisted on, because it is not found in the best copies.<a name=420:10></a> Dead and risen with Christ is the scriptural language.<a name=420:11></a> Union with Him in death is not exact, because real union with Him is only when He is glorified, and we have received the Holy Ghost.<a name=420:12></a> The Holy Ghost is the power of this union (see 2 Corinthians 1: 21, 22), and the reality of this union is definitely stated in 1 Corinthians 6: 17.<a name=420:13></a> Christians may not have learned this, and then we must have patience.<a name=420:14></a> They lose a great deal, but God can reveal this also unto them.<a name=420:15></a> The other point belongs to simple faith in the plain statements of scripture, and belongs to the basis of Christianity, because the baptism of the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost was dependent on it, and it is part of Christ's glory, as the foundation of all we are entitled to.<a name=420:16></a> See Hebrews 2, as defining the position: He is glorified, but all things are not yet put under Him.<a name=420:17></a>

		If you put these passages peacefully and graciously before our brother, he will doubtless see it is so, and that may lead him on to the other point, which, though plainly stated in scripture, is more connected with experimental acquaintance with that state.<a name=420:18></a>

		Dearest G Glenny, -- You will have dear -- with you before this letter reaches you, which will have relieved you for the moment, at any rate, from what presses upon you, but I fully sympathise with you.<a name=425:1></a> It is often my lot, and it grieves me.<a name=425:2></a> One can only cast oneself on the Lord, and pray to Him to develop what is wanting.<a name=425:3></a> It is not always a bad feeling, better than mere forwardness any way.<a name=425:4></a> Some people have more gift in drawing out others than others have (not of course at the meeting).<a name=425:5></a> But it is natural that at the first they should not feel much courage; but in looking to the Lord, He will draw this out.<a name=425:6></a> The work is His, and He alone can ready do it.<a name=425:7></a> Meanwhile we have only to walk in simplicity.<a name=425:8></a> If opportunity is given, and we see it is only timidity in a person <i>morally ripe</i>, encourage them -- I do not say invite, for this is another thing which does not do.<a name=425:9></a> It is taking the place of the leading of the Holy Ghost; and, while leaving every opportunity to others, as really desirous of their taking part, serve Christ yourself, as the Holy Ghost may lead you for the edification of all.<a name=425:10></a> God will develop what is right in due time .<a name=425:11></a>.<a name=425:12></a>.<a name=425:13></a> .<a name=425:14></a>

		DEAR MRS.<a name=426:1></a> -- , -- I dare say you are a nervous person, and your mind upset by it, and this doctor's word thus took possession of it.<a name=426:2></a> But if you had peace with God, it would give you a rest and quietness of spirit, which would greatly relieve you.<a name=426:3></a> Now I do not doubt that God has wrought in your soul, and therefore all is yours; but the first effect of His working is to distress and trouble us, because we cannot say that all is ours, and then look to our state and our fruit and our feelings, to know if we are His; that is, we look to the work of the Spirit in us, and so to the imperfect fruits in us, of His working, which cannot give us rest, and ought not.<a name=426:4></a> Jesus does not say, Find out your state, and you shall have rest, but, "Come unto me, all ye that labour, and are heavy laden," as you are, "and I will give you rest.<a name=426:5></a>" Our rest comes not from our being what He wants, but His being what we want.<a name=426:6></a> He has made peace by the blood of the cross.<a name=426:7></a> That is all settled for those who believe in Him, as you do; but then, besides that, He has a tender gracious care over, and interest in us, can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities.<a name=426:8></a> As to our conscience, He has done what purges our sins, and so our conscience.<a name=426:9></a> As it is written, "Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity," and for this God will have nothing but Christ's work known by faith, no feelings or fruits or anything; we believe it only, that it may be by grace.<a name=426:10></a> Otherwise we should have our part, and be able to boast, but then the tender loving kindness of Christ enters into all our trials and weaknesses.<a name=426:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now you want to have done with looking to yourself -- "In me, that is in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing" -- and know that the Lord imputes nothing to you, and it is not till we submit to God's righteousness that we get strength.<a name=426:12></a> You look to getting the victory in order to get peace: we must get peace to get the victory -- peace already made by Christ's work -- then you will get strength; we do not find it till we see we have none.<a name=426:13></a> Conflict we shall still find.<a name=426:14></a> You may remain possibly a nervous person, but you will know that God is for you, and that changes everything.<a name=426:15></a> He has proved it in giving His Son, who died for us when we were mere sinners.<a name=426:16></a> Look simply to Him who has died for us and finished His work, for "herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us.<a name=426:17></a>" I do not ask you to accept anything, but to believe that God has given and accepted His Son for you.<a name=426:18></a> "They looked unto him and were lightened.<a name=426:19></a>" .<a name=426:20></a>.<a name=426:21></a>.<a name=426:22></a> Look to Him who is God's wisdom, and He will give you rest.<a name=426:23></a>

		Mr Ulrich, I was most glad to hear your account of -- and the dear brethren there, and parts around, and the rather as it was happy.<a name=427:1></a> My heart has not left the dear brethren in America, though my body has, and I am happy that you are getting on happily in your meetings .<a name=427:2></a>.<a name=427:3></a>.<a name=427:4></a> .<a name=427:5></a> They say in England, 'Well begun, half done'; I suspect the meeting was begun not well, not knowing what they were about, though with right and godly intentions.<a name=427:6></a> I have no doubt with you, as in our case in England too, our part is to pursue with patience a right path, and leave the results to God: I mean not occupied with the path of all around us, only keeping the heart and fellowship open for every child of God walking rightly, or we lose blessing ourselves.<a name=427:7></a> "Love to all the saints" is an element of the blessing spoken of by the apostle, and even as to intelligence -- "able to comprehend with all saints"; because they are in Christ's heart, and if not in ours, He has not His place, and self has so far excluded Him.<a name=427:8></a> Yet I believe faithfulness in the path we walk in is of the last importance.<a name=427:9></a> My old song is -- the feet in the narrow path and the heart large; because it makes the eye single and banishes self But we have great need of patience and grace of God, and heart reference to Christ, that we may have wisdom and true love in our intercourse with others.<a name=427:10></a> The present good of a soul (besides receiving good and communion) according to its then actual need, is what we should always seek: never mind 'the brethren' -- true brethren will do that according to the love of Christ working in them.<a name=427:11></a>

		As to ourselves, it is what is said to Israel -- "I will leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of the Lord"; it is true we have joys and a spring of service they cannot have then; but in the character of a remnant in the midst of a ruined dispensation, which is one side of our position, it is the spirit in which we have to walk: a clear apprehension that Christ as man has entered into a wholly new position, where Adam innocent never was, and is now glorified, all being finished as to the work, and the Holy Ghost thereon come down, so that we stand with the Holy Ghost dwelling in us, between an accomplished redemption of His procuring (and a Man in glory in virtue of it -- the full work at His first coming and its results in His Person -- our place in spirit), and the second coming, when we shall actually be with Him and like Him in glory.<a name=427:12></a> Meanwhile we are to be as men that wait for their Lord when He shall return from the wedding, that when He comes and knocks they may open to Him immediately; set down to table in heaven, and He minister to us, and serve while He is away, and then reign -- both in Luke 12.<a name=427:13></a>

		[From the French.<a name=429:1></a>] -- - The principle of which you speak in the postscript of your letter, is <i>monasticism</i>, where that is sincere.<a name=429:2></a> I gave way to it at the beginning of my conversion.<a name=429:3></a> I said to myself, If I fast two days, three would be better, seven better still.<a name=429:4></a> Then that would not do to go on, but I pursued the system long enough.<a name=429:5></a> It led to nothing, except the discovery of one's own powerlessness.<a name=429:6></a> I took Romans 6, and wondered at it, but I understood nothing of it.<a name=429:7></a> One cannot put the flesh to death, except by killing oneself.<a name=429:8></a> It is as dead and risen with Christ that we mortify our <i>members</i> (the apostle will not allow that we live in these things) which are upon the earth; and, in order to do it, we must have not only life, but deliverance by the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit dwelling in us -- we must be set free.<a name=429:9></a> "If ye then be risen .<a name=429:10></a>.<a name=429:11></a>.<a name=429:12></a> mortify therefore," etc.<a name=429:13></a> (Colossians 3) In Romans 8: 3 we have the secret of it; it is that God condemned sin in the flesh, when Christ was a sacrifice for sin.<a name=429:14></a> <i>He</i> took the condemnation, but it was in death, so that there is no more condemnation, and we are dead, crucified with Him.<a name=429:15></a> We have not only the life (we find that in Rom vii.<a name=429:16></a>) but the resurrection of Christ, and the power of the Holy Spirit dwelling in us.<a name=429:17></a> The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has delivered us.<a name=429:18></a> Now this is the order of the realisation of this.<a name=429:19></a> In Colossians 3 God declares, "Ye are dead.<a name=429:20></a>" In Romans 6 it is the effect through faith: "Reckon yourselves to be dead, and alive unto God in Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=429:21></a>" Then in 2 Corinthians 4 we find the thing put into practice: "Always bearing about in the body the dying of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.<a name=429:22></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		Some of -- 's phrases do not perhaps go further than this passage; provided that we can suppose the possession of life already to be recognised, as the passage expressly supposes.<a name=429:23></a> But this, and the Holy Spirit, are absolutely necessary, for we bear about in the body death, in order that the life of Jesus may be manifested; therefore it must be there.<a name=429:24></a> Thus we find in Romans 8, "If Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin," etc.<a name=429:25></a> The difference here is that the death of Christ is the efficacious cause.<a name=429:26></a> But to have part in it we must be quickened.<a name=429:27></a> The Red Sea is before, Gilgal after the passage of the Jordan.<a name=429:28></a> So Romans 6: 12 comes after verse 11, as Colossians 3: 5 comes after 3: 1.<a name=429:29></a> But, on the other hand, we must not use the truth that we are dead with Christ and risen with Him, to weaken 2 Corinthians 4, or Colossians 3: 5.<a name=429:30></a> There is diligence and realisation in us, also God uses tribulations to prove or to produce this realisation.<a name=429:31></a> "Death works in us": we mortify, etc.<a name=429:32></a>, only we must have the life first and count ourselves dead with Christ: "I am crucified with Christ.<a name=429:33></a>" If we have understood this, we mortify, etc.<a name=429:34></a>, having the life to be able to do it, and having understood deliverance.<a name=429:35></a> What precedes is only Romans vii.<a name=429:36></a>, useful to find out that we have no strength.<a name=429:37></a> We are never called to die to sin, but to hold ourselves for dead because Christ died, and we, believing, are crucified with Him.<a name=429:38></a> We are called to mortify our members, but mortifying is the reverse of dying; it is power acting against another object.<a name=429:39></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Deliverance is not only the blood of Christ, the basis of everything, but death and resurrection.<a name=429:40></a> It is not the pardon of that which is produced by the old man, but the enjoyment of the efficacy of the death and resurrection of Christ; it is to have passed from the old man ("when we were in the flesh") into the second Man, Christ risen ("those who are in Christ Jesus"), where the law of the Spirit of life has made me free, the foundation being that, in the death of Christ, God has condemned sin in the flesh.<a name=429:41></a> The element of power is the presence of the Holy Spirit.<a name=429:42></a> "Ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you.<a name=429:43></a> Now if Christ be in you," etc.<a name=429:44></a>

		I fear my letter is rather unconnected, for I am very busy, but I am anxious that we should not weaken 2 Corinthians 4, because we know Colossians 3.<a name=429:45></a> and Romans 6.<a name=429:46></a> Besides, your postscript shews that this ignorance exists .<a name=429:47></a>.<a name=429:48></a>.<a name=429:49></a> .<a name=429:50></a>

		[From the French.<a name=431:1></a>] DEAR SIR,<a href="#431:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> -- My reply to the letter which you were good enough to address to me has been delayed by unceasing work which has left me no leisure.<a name=431:2></a> I have no difficulty as to informing you what my belief is, but a public newspaper is scarcely the place where I should wish to use my pen.<a name=431:3></a> I believe that the christian calling is a heavenly one, that the Christian is not of the world as his Master is not of it, and that he is placed down here as an epistle of Christ to manifest the life of Jesus amongst men, whilst waiting for the Lord to come to take him to be with Himself in the glory.<a name=431:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As Editor of the "<i>Franais</i>" you will quite understand that articles written in order to inculcate such principles as these would little suit a political newspaper.<a name=431:5></a> Now I live only for these things -- a life feebly realised I am quite ready to confess -- but I live only for them.<a name=431:6></a> However, I will communicate to you what appears to interest you, namely, what has led me, and others with me, to take up the position in which we find ourselves as Christians.<a name=431:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is well perhaps, in view of the infidelity which is spreading everywhere, to begin by saying that I hold, and I can add that we firmly hold, all the foundations of the christian faith -- the divinity of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, one God, eternally blessed -- the divinity and humanity of the Lord Jesus, two natures in one person -- His resurrection and His glorification at the right hand of God -- the presence of the Holy Ghost here below, having descended on the day of Pentecost -- the return of the Lord Jesus according to His promise.<a name=431:8></a> We believe also that the Father in His love has sent the Son to accomplish the work of redemption and grace towards men -- that the Son came, in that same love, to accomplish it, and that He has finished the work which the Father gave Him to do on earth.<a name=431:9></a> We believe that He has made propitiation for our sins, and that after having accomplished it, He ascended to heaven -- the High Priest seated at the right hand of the Majesty on high.<a name=431:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Other truths are connected with these, such as the miraculous birth of the Saviour, who was absolutely without sin -- and yet others; but, you will readily understand, sir, that my object is not to give a course of lectures or a theological summary, but to make it quite clear that it is in nowise on the giving up of the great foundations of the christian faith that our position is based.<a name=431:11></a> Any one who would deny one or other of these fundamental truths would not be received amongst us, and any one who, being amongst us, adopted some doctrine which would undermine one or other of these same truths would be excluded, but only after all proper means to bring him back to the truth had been exhausted.<a name=431:12></a> For although these are dogmas, we hold them as essential to living faith and to salvation, to the spiritual and christian life of which we live as born of God.<a name=431:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But you wish, sir, to know not only the great truths which we hold in common with others, but also what distinguishes us from others.<a name=431:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, without in the least professing to give a course of christian doctrine in connection with the truths I have just pointed out, I am anxious, indeed I would heartily desire, to set them forth as the foundation, recognising as true Christians and members of the body of Christ all those who, by the grace of God, and by the operation of the Holy Ghost who has been given to them, truly believe these things In their souls.<a name=431:15></a> Converted by the grace of God, I spent six or seven years under the rod of the law, feeling that Christ was the only Saviour, but not being able to say that I possessed Him, or that I was saved by Him; fasting, praying, giving alms -- always good things when done spiritually -- but not possessing peace, whilst at the same time feeling that if the Son of God had Himself forgiven me, I owed myself to Him -- my body, soul, and means.<a name=431:16></a> At length God gave me to understand that I was in Christ, united to Him by the Holy Ghost -- "At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you" (John 14: 20), which means that when the Holy Ghost, the Comforter, should have come, the disciples would know these things.<a name=431:17></a> With this were connected other blessed and reassuring truths -- "There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus.<a name=431:18></a>" (Romans 8: 1)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The promise of the Spirit is given to all those who have part in the remission of their sins, for "he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.<a name=431:19></a>" (1 Corinthians 6: 17.<a name=431:20></a>) Hence Christians are temples of the Holy Ghost -- "Your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost who is in you.<a name=431:21></a>" (1 Corinthians 6: 19)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I should say that at this time the word of God became for me an <i>absolute authority</i> as to faith and practice; not that I had doubted it previously, but it had now become such from conviction, implanted by God Himself in my heart.<a name=431:22></a> In this way the assurance of salvation through the work of Christ, the presence of the Holy Ghost dwelling in us, by whom "having believed, ye have been sealed for the day of redemption" (Ephesians 1: 13, 14), salvation known and possessed, and this indwelling of the Holy Ghost giving us the assurance of it, constitute the normal state of the Christian.<a name=431:23></a> He is no longer of this world, save to pass through it peacefully, doing the will of God.<a name=431:24></a> Bought with a great price, he is to glorify God in his conduct.<a name=431:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This brings in the thought of the church and of its unity.<a name=431:26></a> For me the body of Christ was now composed of those who were united by the Holy Ghost to the Head -- Christ in heaven.<a name=431:27></a> If we were seated in the heavenly places in Christ ("Even when we were dead in sins .<a name=431:28></a>.<a name=431:29></a> hath he quickened us together with Christ -- by grace ye are saved," Ephesians 2: 1, 5) what were we still waiting for?<a name=431:30></a> For Christ to come to place us up there in fact.<a name=431:31></a> "I will come again" said the Lord, "and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.<a name=431:32></a>" (John 14: 3) "Our citizenship is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Lord Jesus Christ as Saviour, who shall transform our body of humiliation into conformity to his body of glory.<a name=431:33></a>" (Phil 3: 20, 21) We have been converted "to wait for his Son from heaven.<a name=431:34></a>" (1 Thessalonians 1: 9, 10)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence the presence of the Holy Ghost dwelling in him, and the attitude of waiting for the Lord constitute the normal state of the Christian.<a name=431:35></a> But all those who possess this Spirit are, by that very fact, one body.<a name=431:36></a> "For by one Spirit are we all baptised into one body.<a name=431:37></a>" (1 Corinthians 12: 13) Now, this baptism took place on the day of Pentecost.<a name=431:38></a> "Ye shall be baptised with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.<a name=431:39></a>" (Acts 1: 5)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All those around me had not reached that point, at any rate they did not profess to have, and it was easy, reading Acts 2 and 4, to see how far we had got from what God had set up on the earth.<a name=431:40></a> Where was I to look for the church?<a name=431:41></a> I gave up Anglicanism as not being it.<a name=431:42></a> Rome, at the beginning of my conversion, had not failed to attract me.<a name=431:43></a> But the tenth chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews had made that impossible for me: "For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified .<a name=431:44></a>.<a name=431:45></a>.<a name=431:46></a> .<a name=431:47></a> Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.<a name=431:48></a>" (Hebrews 10: 14, 18)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then again it rendered impossible the idea of a sacrificing priesthood down here between me and God; seeing that our position, as the result of the work of Christ, is that we have direct access to God in all confidence.<a name=431:49></a> "Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus.<a name=431:50></a>" (Hebrews 10: 19)

		I am stating facts, sir; I am not entering into controversy: but faith in an accomplished salvation, and, later on the consciousness that I possessed it, hindered me from turning in that direction; whilst having grasped the fact of the unity of the body of Christ, the various dissenting sects no longer attracted me.<a name=431:51></a> As to the unity to which, as we all know, Rome pretends, I found everything in ruins.<a name=431:52></a> The most ancient churches did not want to have anything to say to her, nor did Protestants either, so that the great majority of those who profess Christianity are outside her pale.<a name=431:53></a> On the other hand, it was not a question of seeking this unity amongst the Protestant sects.<a name=431:54></a> Besides, whatever their ecclesiastical position might be, most of those who call themselves Christians are of the world, just as much as a pagan might be.<a name=431:55></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the 12th chapter of the first Epistle to the Corinthians shews clearly that there is a church formed on the earth by the descent of the Holy Ghost.<a name=431:56></a> "For by one Spirit are we all baptised into one body"; and it is evident that this is on the earth, for "Ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.<a name=431:57></a>" (1 Corinthians 12: 27) Besides, the apostle speaks of gifts of healing and of tongues, which only apply to the state of the assembly down here.<a name=431:58></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The assembly of God, then, has been formed on the earth, and ought always to have been manifested.<a name=431:59></a> Alas!<a name=431:60></a> it has not been so.<a name=431:61></a> In the first place, with regard to individuals, the Lord had pointed this out beforehand.<a name=431:62></a> "The wolf catcheth them and scattereth the sheep," but, thank God, "No one shall catch them out of my hand," said the same faithful Shepherd.<a name=431:63></a> (John 10: 12, 28)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But this is not all: the Apostle Paul, bidding farewell to the faithful of Asia, said, "I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock, and of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.<a name=431:64></a>" Acts 20: 29, 30.<a name=431:65></a>) Jude declares that already in his time, deceitful men had crept in among the Christians, and, which is of all importance, they are marked out as being the object of the judgment of the Lord when He comes again.<a name=431:66></a> "Certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men.<a name=431:67></a>" "The Lord cometh with ten thousand of his saints, to execute judgment upon all.<a name=431:68></a>" (Jude 4, 16.<a name=431:69></a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These men were corrupters within the church, but there will be those who will entirely abandon the christian faith.<a name=431:70></a> "Little children," says the Apostle John, "it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists: whereby we know that it is the last time, They went out from us," etc.<a name=431:71></a> (1 John 2: 18, 19)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But even this is not all.<a name=431:72></a> The Apostle Paul tells us, "Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his.<a name=431:73></a> And, Let every one that nameth the name of the Lord depart from iniquity.<a name=431:74></a> But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.<a name=431:75></a> If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel to honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work.<a name=431:76></a>" (2 Timothy 2: 19-21.<a name=431:77></a>) Here is the church: it is a great house with vessels of all kinds and a call comes to the faithful man to purify himself from the vessels to dishonour.<a name=431:78></a> The following chapter is still more definite.<a name=431:79></a> "This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.<a name=431:80></a> For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud," etc.<a name=431:81></a> (2 Timothy 3: 1-5.<a name=431:82></a>) These are almost exactly the same terms as he uses when he charges the heathen with sin (Romans 1: 29-31), but he adds here, "Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof.<a name=431:83></a>" (2 Timothy 3: 5)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He warns us that "All that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.<a name=431:84></a> But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse" (2 Timothy 3: 12, 13); but he gives us as a safeguard the knowledge of the person from whom we have learnt those things which we believe -- it is the apostle himself; with the scriptures, which can make us wise to salvation by the faith which is in Christ Jesus.<a name=431:85></a> He assures us that "All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof," etc.<a name=431:86></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we have the proof that evil, having entered into the church, would continue and would not be healed.<a name=431:87></a> "The mystery of iniquity," says the apostle, "doth already work: only he who now hinders will hinder until he be taken out of the way.<a name=431:88></a> And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus shall consume with the breath of his mouth, and shall destroy by the brightness of his coming.<a name=431:89></a>" (2 Thessalonians 2: 7, 8) The evil which was already working in the time of the apostle was, then, to continue until the wicked one himself should be revealed.<a name=431:90></a> The Lord will destroy him then by His coming; and although it be not spoken of the church properly so called, the same thing is revealed to us in regard to Christendom, for we learn that tares have been sown in the place where the Lord had sown good grain.<a name=431:91></a> When the servants desire to pull up the tares, the Lord forbids them, saying, "Let both grow together until the harvest.<a name=431:92></a>" (Matthew 13: 24-30) The evil done to the kingdom of God was to remain in the field of this world until the judgment.<a name=431:93></a> Christ will doubtless gather the good grain into His garner, but the crop is spoiled down here.<a name=431:94></a> You will tell me, But the gates of hell are not to prevail against that which Christ has built.<a name=431:95></a> Granted, and I bless God for it with all my heart, but we must distinguish here as the word of God does.<a name=431:96></a> There is on the one hand the work of Christ, and on the other what is done by men and under their responsibility.<a name=431:97></a> The enemy will never destroy what Christ built (we speak of the church of God), nor will he prevail against the work of the Lord.<a name=431:98></a> Whatever be the evil that has come in -- for that there are heresies and schisms we do not deny -- that which Christ works has endured and will endure for ever.<a name=431:99></a> It is the house which we find in 1 Peter 2, the living stones coming to Christ as to the living stone, and built to be a spiritual house.<a name=431:100></a> I find this house also in Ephesians 2 -- "Ye are fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God; and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner-stone; in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto a holy temple in the Lord.<a name=431:101></a>" (Ephesians 2: 19-21) Here it is again the work of the Lord Himself; living stones who come, a building composed of saints, growing to be a temple which is not yet completely built.<a name=431:102></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, in scripture, the house of God on earth is viewed in another way also.<a name=431:103></a> "As a wise master-builder," says the Apostle Paul, "I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon .<a name=431:104></a>.<a name=431:105></a>.<a name=431:106></a> .<a name=431:107></a> If any man build upon this foundation gold .<a name=431:108></a>.<a name=431:109></a>.<a name=431:110></a> wood, hay, stubble; every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work, of what sort it is.<a name=431:111></a>" "Know ye not," he adds, "that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?<a name=431:112></a> If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.<a name=431:113></a>" (1 Corinthians 3: 10-13; 16, 17)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here then I find the responsibility of man and the judgment of his work; the whole is called the temple of God, and the judgment of God commences there, at His house, says the Apostle Peter.<a name=431:114></a> Already, during the lifetime of the apostle, the time had come for that (1 Peter 4: 17), although the patience of God, acting in grace, still waited.<a name=431:115></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I recognise, therefore, the responsibility of the house of God, of the whole of Christendom.<a name=431:116></a> That which Christ Himself builds is one thing, and the fruit of His labours will not be lost; that which responsible man builds is another thing.<a name=431:117></a> At the beginning "the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.<a name=431:118></a>" (Acts 2: 47) Soon "false brethren" crept in, tares were sown, and the house was filled with all kinds of vessels, from which faithfulness was to purge itself; and with a form of godliness without power, from which the faithful one was to turn away.<a name=431:119></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is what the word of God presents to us historically and prophetically in the New Testament: this word, addressed by the teachers to the faithful, is our resource when these perilous times should come; and, if that were necessary, the facts have borne out all that it says.<a name=431:120></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What is to be done?<a name=431:121></a> The word declares to us that where two or three are gathered to the name of Jesus, He will be in their midst.<a name=431:122></a> (Matthew 18: 20) This is what we have done.<a name=431:123></a> There were only four of us to do it at the first; not, I hope, in a spirit of pride or presumption, but deeply grieved at seeing the state of that which surrounded us, praying for all Christians, and recognising all those who possessed the Spirit of God, every true Christian wherever he might be found ecclesiastically, as members of the body of Christ.<a name=431:124></a> We were not thinking of anything else, dear sir, than of satisfying the need of our souls according to the word of God, and we had us thought that the thing would have gone any further.<a name=431:125></a> We have thus found the promised presence of the Lord.<a name=431:126></a> Salvation through Christ has been preached, when there was gift to do so.<a name=431:127></a> The same needs caused others to follow the same road, and thus the work has extended in a way of which we had not the remotest idea.<a name=431:128></a> It commenced in Dublin, to spread in the British Isles, in France, where a great number of persons, open unbelievers, were converted: in Switzerland, where the work on the Continent had commenced, in Germany, in Holland, in Denmark, where it is commencing, in Sweden, where a great religious movement is going on at this moment.<a name=431:129></a> The path we follow has spread to a considerable extent in the British Colonies, and more recently in the United States, in Asia, in Africa, and elsewhere.<a name=431:130></a> The Spirit of God acts and produces needs of soul to which the religious systems offer no answer.<a name=431:131></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In a word, this is definitely the position of those brethren who rest on the authority of the word of God.<a name=431:132></a> Christ is seen, in this word, as the Saviour, in three different positions: -- first, as accomplishing redemption on the cross; then, as seated at the Father's right hand, the Holy Ghost being thereupon sent down here; finally as coming back to take His own to be with Himself.<a name=431:133></a> These Christians believe, these things have the assurance of their salvation, having faith in the efficacy of this redemption; and finally, being sealed with the Holy Spirit, who dwells in every true Christian, they wait for the Son of God from heaven without knowing the moment of His coming.<a name=431:134></a> "For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father!<a name=431:135></a>" (Romans 8: 15) We believe in the promise "I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.<a name=431:136></a>" (John 14: 3) Absolute faith in the efficacy of redemption; the seal of the Spirit which gives the assurance of salvation and the consciousness of being children of God; the attitude of waiting for the Lord -- this is what characterises these Christians.<a name=431:137></a> Bought with a great price, they are bound to regard themselves as no longer belonging to themselves, but to the Lord Jesus, to please Him in everything and to live only for Him.<a name=431:138></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not mean to say, sir, that we all walk at the full height of the heavenly calling, but we acknowledge the obligation to do so.<a name=431:139></a> If any one fails openly in what becomes a Christian, in point of morality or in what concerns the faith, he is excluded.<a name=431:140></a> We abstain from the pleasures and amusements of the world.<a name=431:141></a> If we have evening parties, it is for the purpose of studying the word and of edifying ourselves together.<a name=431:142></a> We do not mix in politics; we are not of the world: we do not vote.<a name=431:143></a> We submit to the established authorities, whatever they may be, in so far as they command nothing expressly contrary to the will of Christ.<a name=431:144></a> We take the Lord's supper every Sunday, and those who have gift for it preach the gospel of salvation to sinners or teach believers.<a name=431:145></a> Every one is bound to seek the salvation or good of his neighbour according to the capacity which God has given him.<a name=431:146></a> Feeling that Christendom is corrupt, we are outside the church-world, by whatever name it is called.<a name=431:147></a> As to the number of those who follow this course I cannot tell you what it is: we do not number ourselves, wishing to remain in the littleness which becomes Christians.<a name=431:148></a> Besides, we reckon as a brother in Christ every person who has the Spirit of Christ.<a name=431:149></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not know that I have anything else to put before you.<a name=431:150></a> I am almost ashamed, sir, to have given such a long explanation of the principles which govern the walk of the Christians in question.<a name=431:151></a> We recognise that the church is one, the body of Christ: then, too, the house of God by the Spirit.<a name=431:152></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You ask me what is the advantage of this course.<a name=431:153></a> Obedience to the word of God suffices to decide us.<a name=431:154></a> To obey Christ is the first requirement of the soul which knows itself saved by Him, and even of every soul acknowledging Him as the Son of God, who has loved us so much and has given Himself for us.<a name=431:155></a> But in fact, in obeying Him, in spite of weakness, faults and failures -- which, on my part, I own -- His presence manifests itself to the soul as an ineffable source of joy, as the earnest of a bliss where failures, blessed be His name for it, will no longer be found, and where He will be fully glorified in all believers.<a name=431:156></a>

		You will tell me that these pages scarcely suit a newspaper.<a name=431:157></a> I admit it, but it is because the current of my thoughts scarcely flows in that line.<a name=431:158></a> I have explained to you in all simplicity what you asked me, and as well as I could.<a name=431:159></a> Having had to take up my work more than once owing to unavoidable interruptions, I much fear that it may contain some repetitions.<a name=431:160></a> Please excuse them and accept the assurance of my esteem.<a name=431:161></a><br>1878.<a name=431:162></a>

		[Workington], There is no telling what folly man's mind will run to: still, soundness in faith, fundamental truth, will keep the soul from these human wanderings.<a name=440:1></a> I have heard of this folly once.<a name=440:2></a> When he says, 'Of Jacob's seed God made no selection, but accepted them all': what does accepted mean?<a name=440:3></a> That nationally Israel is accepted for earthly things, and called so (John 3), scripture teaches, but who told him they were accepted for heavenly things, or as righteous?<a name=440:4></a> This is inventing, not believing.<a name=440:5></a> That Jacob or Israel is elect for earth, scripture does teach; and that as a nation they will be blessed -- the gifts and calling of God being without repentance -- scripture teaches.<a name=440:6></a> But this says nothing as to their souls being saved; but the positive testimonies to the contrary are clear.<a name=440:7></a> (Isaiah 65: 9) Read the whole chapter, which teaches positively that only a remnant shall be saved.<a name=440:8></a> Chapter 66 shews the same truth if there be intelligence.<a name=440:9></a> Romans 11, while plainly declaring their certain blessing as a nation, yet lays it in an election according to grace, and at the time of the people's deliverance -- when "all Israel shall be saved.<a name=440:10></a>" Daniel 12 is quite clear that an elect remnant only who are written in the book shall be delivered, and that many shall arise to shame and everlasting contempt.<a name=440:11></a> Zechariah 13: 8, 9 is also clear as to there being only a remnant spared from the great tribulation; if the Lord had not left them a very small remnant, they would be as Sodom and Gomorrah.<a name=440:12></a> And note, these statements apply to the time when it is said all Israel (not all the Israelites) shall be saved.<a name=440:13></a> Isaiah 4 clearly teaches the same truth, that it is in a very small remnant this blessing will be effected: not all Israel, because they are not gathered to the church, but saved as a people -- all that are spared.<a name=440:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the ten tribes we have the same testimony, that only a remnant will be delivered.<a name=440:15></a> Zechariah shews us two thirds cut off in the land -- Jews.<a name=440:16></a> Ezekiel 20 teaches us that the rebels of the ten tribes will be purged out, and not allowed to enter into the land.<a name=440:17></a> And in this very place where the rebels are cut off, and not allowed to enter into the land, there it is said of all the spared ones, "There shall all the house of Israel, all of them in the land, serve me," making the teaching of scripture too plain to leave a trace of doubt.<a name=440:18></a> But the truth should have hindered such a delusion, because where Israel's restoration is taught, it is not only said they were blinded, but they did not attain to the law of righteousness.<a name=440:19></a> The application of "mercy upon all" is an utter mis-application.<a name=440:20></a> What the apostle is teaching is, that as the Gentiles had no promises, and it was sovereign mercy to them, so the Jews, having not only broken the law, but rejected the promises in rejecting Christ, in whom they were, come under mercy like a Gentile, though the promises would be fulfilled.<a name=440:21></a> The "all" in verse 32 (Romans 11) refers to Jews, and Gentiles in verses 30, 31.<a name=440:22></a> In the last you must read, "Have not believed in your mercy that they may be objects of mercy.<a name=440:23></a>" (See Isaiah 10: 20-22) Nothing can be plainer that the deliverance is for the remnant only.<a name=440:24></a>

		The purpose of God in their fall has nothing to do with the condition of those who did fall, rejecting Christ, yea, blaspheming the Holy Ghost, so that there was no forgiveness in that or the coming age -- "never forgiveness" -- and on whom the Lord pronounced the damnation of hell.<a name=440:45></a> And what he says as to the Holy Ghost excusing them because of their ignorance is wholly false: there was a suspension of judgment through Christ's intercession; and the Holy Ghost by Peter says, "Repent therefore and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out"; but they did not repent, but stopped their mouths, and Stephen, summing up against them, declares that they resisted the Holy Ghost as well as incurred all other guilt under law, prophets and Christ.<a name=440:46></a> The spared remnant will be all righteous; all the rebels will have been cut off.<a name=440:47></a> If two were in one bed, the one would be taken in judgment, the other left.<a name=440:48></a> For God will then return and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth Him not.<a name=440:49></a> They will be graffed in again into their own vine .<a name=440:50></a>.<a name=440:51></a>.<a name=440:52></a> .<a name=440:53></a> Christ, and Christ only, is the true vine, and even there fruitless branches are broken off: but though, as a nation, Israel was a vine brought out of Egypt, it never was the true vine.<a name=440:54></a> I have no doubt that the nation will be restored, and have the promises in the land; but what has that to do with all their souls being saved -- unless to turn people away from the truth?<a name=440:55></a>

		I have forgotten to notice Ezekiel 37.<a name=440:67></a> I deny it means any resurrection of bodies at all, and for a very plain reason, that it is explained otherwise in the passage (verse 11), "Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost; we are cut off for our parts.<a name=440:68></a>" And we have a prophecy which explains it all besides, where the whole house of Israel is explained to be contrasted with the Jews, and the stick of Israel and the stick of Judah are to be united in the land, and God will take them from among the heathen, whither they be gone -- He does not say, the good and believing ones; but He does say He will purify them and sanctify them, in words which, if not quoted, are referred to by the Lord in John 3, where He insists that unless born again (speaking in Israel) none should see or enter the kingdom of God.<a name=440:69></a> And we have already seen that in chapter 20 this prophet declares from God that He will purge out the rebels in the way, and they shall not enter the land.<a name=440:70></a> The whole thought is a denial of the constantly repeated declaration that a remnant should be saved, and what is worse, of the plain declarations of the word of God as to being saved or lost.<a name=440:71></a><br>1878.<a name=440:72></a>

		[H Talbot], The pastor as such fed and taught: it is directly connected with teaching (under one article in Greek, Ephesians 4 11), but goes further than teaching, as not merely expounding and putting forth the word, but suiting it to souls, and caring for them in a shepherding way.<a name=444:1></a> An elder is an overseer, looks after them in moral oversight.<a name=444:2></a> It was desirable that he should be didaktikov" not a proper gift of teacher, but able to use the word in his oversight, as it of course added weight and intelligence to his inspection of their ways; but some had, some had not, this desirable qualification, for it is said "especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.<a name=444:3></a>" What was proper to them was mature habits of family care which qualified them for the exercise of oversight in general, and subduedness of self, and order.<a name=444:4></a> None of these things were looked for in the pastor; it was a positive gift from Christ on high, and exercised in the whole body wherever a person was, whereas an elder was a local overseer of people.<a name=444:5></a> The word "elder" which seems to imply generally age enough to give weight to the position, seen also in his having a well-regulated family, but it is not the word used for an old man: married men with a well-ordered subject family they had to be.<a name=444:6></a>

		But I say no more, as this occupation with the forms of Christianity (though bowing to them as such) I find has little edification and much wearying of the mind.<a name=445:18></a> Only of course one is the servant of others, if they have it on their minds.<a name=445:19></a> Our brother could not do better than wait on the Lord.<a name=445:20></a> My mind is clear, but I should accept him as cordially if he walk close with Christ, whatever his views may be: and with the Lord close to him he will be guided.<a name=445:21></a> I do not rebaptise those sprinkled as children, because if a person has been he cannot be again, though I do not like the form.<a name=445:22></a> The Lord give our brother peace in his spirit by His own presence.<a name=445:23></a>

		Those who speak of the sixth and tenth chapters of the Epistle to the Hebrews certainly are not delivered; only in these cases they have, in general, exposed themselves to Satan in a positive way.<a name=452:8></a> I do not believe that when people have really got out of Romans vii.<a name=452:9></a> they get back into it.<a name=452:10></a> One may have truly received forgiveness of sins and had joy; but self is not known, and it is necessary to know oneself to be delivered.<a name=452:11></a> People are often deceived on this point.<a name=452:12></a> The joy was well founded, but it was not deliverance: this joy flows from the forgiveness of sins and not from deliverance from sin.<a name=452:13></a> The Epistle to the Romans up to the eleventh verse of chapter 5 speaks of the former; from the twelfth verse of chapter 5 to the end of chapter 8, of the latter.<a name=452:14></a>

		DEAR BRETHREN, -- I see nothing at all to hinder brethren, who find themselves together for bathing, breaking bread together, provided it be done in a spirit of unity with the meetings they belong to.<a name=457:1></a> In the case of a resident Christian walking uprightly in the truth, calling "on the name of the Lord out of a pure heart," he has the same title as if he desired to walk permanently with brethren.<a name=457:2></a> There is nothing to hinder; but it would be happy (specially if those at the bathing-place were young brethren) that the matter be communicated to the meeting they belong to, that the thing may be done seriously and with christian care.<a name=457:3></a> In the former case it is to preserve confidence and unity, in the latter for right christian care.<a name=457:4></a> The true character of the gathering is preserved, that is, two or three gathered together in Christ's name; but it is important that it should be done in unity with those already gathered.<a name=457:5></a> Full liberty, but liberty in hearty unity, is what we have to seek, and subjection of individual will to the action of the Holy Ghost in the whole.<a name=457:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to your second question,<a href="#457:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> it is practically answered.<a name=457:7></a> Provided it be done in a spirit of unity, I see nothing to hinder.<a name=457:8></a> It might be on purpose to act against the assembly when the single absent brother did not walk well: this would be clearly wrong; and what I say always supposes that all are walking godlily and in grace.<a name=457:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the third question,<a href="#457:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a> it is always desirable that they should do it in unity with those united in the place nearest, or whence they come.<a name=457:10></a> No one can hinder their doing it, but it is not done happily or godlily when it is not done in communion with those with whom they are already in communion.<a name=457:11></a>

		[J Powell] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- Exaggerations are always dangerous and, where imagination is at work, deceive to people's cost; but the subject is a serious one.<a name=458:1></a> 'Dead to nature' is not a scriptural expression; so we must see what people mean and what scripture says.<a name=458:2></a> But deadness to the world and all the flesh is after, is what is wanting among Christians.<a name=458:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards natural relationships, they are very carefully maintained in scripture.<a name=458:4></a> The matter stands thus: God established certain relationships, "from the beginning it was not so" (divorce) -- "he which made them at the beginning made them male and female.<a name=458:5></a>" Sin has come in and spoiled all.<a name=458:6></a> A new power has come in which, while fully recognising them as of God, and using them as images of the highest spiritual relationships with Christ and the Father, has nothing to do with them -- is above and out of them.<a name=458:7></a> In general those who say much about them and being dead to nature, do so because they are not.<a name=458:8></a> Paul lives alone, and as a rule says, "let every man have his own wife.<a name=458:9></a>" The speaking against it is of Satan.<a name=458:10></a> The Lord had considered the lilies and how God had clothed them: seeking these things as an object is another matter.<a name=458:11></a> Adam was to dress and keep the garden when he had no sin; but we need to have our affections on things above by a new power, and need a single eye to it to keep us above the power of what is corrupted; "all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.<a name=458:12></a>" They even who had wives must "be as though they had none," for "the time is a constrained one.<a name=458:13></a>" Nature is of God,.<a name=458:14></a> but its corruption is not; and it is corrupted, under the bondage of corruption -- and that is the difficulty.<a name=458:15></a> But 'dead to nature' is legality: to seek it as it is, is not of the Spirit, though He has given us all things richly to enjoy.<a name=458:16></a> My body is of the old creation; my life, as born of God, of the new; and we are left for spiritual exercises in this very way.<a name=458:17></a> Nor is the matter therefore so simply spoken of, as some would humanly: it is meant to be a holy exercise, and those who do not spare the body may be satisfying the flesh.<a name=458:18></a> The apostle speaks for spiritual power and for order, every man has his own gift; but it is a gift.<a name=458:19></a> He wills that men marry as a rule, but tells them the married man cares for the things of the world, that they will have trouble in the flesh, but he spares them.<a name=458:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have died with Christ; our life is hid with Him in God: He is our life.<a name=458:21></a> We have been crucified with Christ, yet live, but not we, but Christ lives in us; and this life lives by the faith of the Son of God.<a name=458:22></a> But you will find that when applied, it is always in view of certain objects which turn the heart from Christ.<a name=458:23></a> "All that is in the world, the lust of the flesh," etc.<a name=458:24></a>, "is not of the Father.<a name=458:25></a>" We are dead "to sin," "to the rudiments of the world.<a name=458:26></a>" You will further find that these are distinguished, and that the highest christian state does not contemplate this at all.<a name=458:27></a> In the Epistle to the Romans the Christian is looked at as a man alive in this world, as we are, but justified, and Christ our life.<a name=458:28></a> Here we get "dead to sin," Christ having died to it, and "our old man is crucified with Christ that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin, for he that is dead is justified from sin" (not sins) -- you cannot accuse a man of sin in the flesh if he is dead.<a name=458:29></a> Colossians goes further: "ye have died"; and here they are risen also, and so are looked at as risen men on the earth: they are dead to the rudiments of the world, are not alive in the world subject to ordinances.<a name=458:30></a> So we are dead "to the law by the body of Christ," in Romans: it is also said, "if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin.<a name=458:31></a>" But dead to nature is, in all that we are said to be dead to, quite unknown to scripture in word or thought.<a name=458:32></a> It falsifies the idea of the bearing of death there.<a name=458:33></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But none of these is the highest measure taken in scripture.<a name=458:34></a> These think of sin, though of death to it, but never of our living in it.<a name=458:35></a> Colossians goes a step further, and on to ground which is fully developed in Ephesians.<a name=458:36></a> When man's highest condition in this respect is spoken of, he has not died to anything: he is viewed as dead in trespasses and sins, and then as a new creation -- a creation after God.<a name=458:37></a> It is just mentioned Colossians 2: 13.<a name=458:38></a> This is fully developed in Ephesians 2.<a name=458:39></a>; and here note, Christ is not viewed as life-giving, but as raised when a dead man, He having descended in grace to where we were, and in an effectual work for us, so that we rise with Him and into the same place.<a name=458:40></a> This is referred to in 2 Corinthians 5: 14, 17, and in the remarkable summary in John 5: 24.<a name=458:41></a> All this stands on a different ground from being quickened and having died: we have changed our place and position, are created anew.<a name=458:42></a> But if dying is to be brought in and dwelt on, people are really in general under law, and do not count themselves dead; and if they talk of dying to nature, which scripture does not, they will soon find to their cost that nature is not dead.<a name=458:43></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I should earnestly press being dead, crucified with Christ; Christ and nothing else our life -- not of the world as Christ is not of the world -- that the Spirit of God be the source of all our thoughts and desires, to live Christ.<a name=458:44></a> Death to sin we have, to the world, our old man crucified with Christ; and if Christ be in us, the body dead because of sin.<a name=458:45></a> So all that is in the world, the lusts and pride, is not of the Father.<a name=458:46></a> But neglecting of the body may be being "vainly puffed up.<a name=458:47></a> by his fleshly mind"; and dead to nature does not enter into the sphere of scriptural thought.<a name=458:48></a> Who is dead to it?<a name=458:49></a> And what is he dead to?<a name=458:50></a> Is the new man dead?<a name=458:51></a> The question would be, Is nature dead?<a name=458:52></a> and that they will soon find out it is not.<a name=458:53></a> They should not eat nor drink: now, they should not do this save to the glory of God, and with prayer and thanksgiving -- have no motive but Christ in anything, the body of sin being destroyed.<a name=458:54></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What is specially wanted now is undivided devotedness.<a name=458:55></a> I dread anything that would weaken that.<a name=458:56></a> But dead to nature, in word or thought scripture does not know; and in the highest character of Christianity, dead to anything does not come in at all, but a new nature in relationship with the Father and with Christ, and in Him, sitting in heavenly places.<a name=458:57></a> If I talk much of being dead to nature, I am occupied with it.<a name=458:58></a> I write briefly and in a hurry, but you will find, I believe.<a name=458:59></a> the principles of scripture here.<a name=458:60></a>

		[F S Monk] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I regret much that this article<a href="#461:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> has been put in, but I do not believe any attack was intended against the atonement.<a name=461:1></a> He speaks of scripture giving no uncertain sound as to that.<a name=461:2></a> It would indeed destroy all the foundation we have to rest in.<a name=461:3></a> some time ago now, brought this idea out, but with no thought of enfeebling the atonement, but merely the use of the word "wrath.<a name=461:4></a>" In my last edition of the Sufferings, I have referred to this, saying I did not change the word lest it should weaken the sense of the thing, but that scripture was wiser than we were.<a name=461:5></a> And I was content then to accept it as a fact, and in one publication [Bible Witness and Review, vol.<a name=461:6></a> 2.<a name=461:7></a> 389] avoided, I think, the use of it without making any remark: as if it was not in scripture, I was sure it was wiser than we -- but I have used it in preaching -- and felt that if so it was to avoid the application of it to His Person: never as to what He did or suffered in atonement.<a name=461:8></a> In these days above all it is necessary to hold this fast.<a name=461:9></a> But I have some thought that Psalm 88 warrants the word itself.<a name=461:10></a> It is not found in the New Testament.<a name=461:11></a> had no such thought, I am assured, as that wrath was not due to us, but only objected to the use of the word as applied to Christ -- not to the substitution of Christ in atonement for us as bearing our sins and drinking the cup and being made a curse: but though, if not in scripture, we do well to speak with scripture, yet I fear in these cases with many they dislike the word because they dislike the thing.<a name=461:12></a> I do not believe it is the case here; but there is danger for others.<a name=461:13></a> Psalm 102 hardly reaches the case, but it seems to me Psalm 88 does.<a name=461:14></a>

		I first heard it used really to deny the truth of propitiation.<a name=461:15></a> -- quoted then Psalm 102, but dropped the word to shew he denied the thing.<a name=461:16></a> This was long ago in Canada, and made me on the watch as to giving up the word.<a name=461:17></a> We cannot be too jealous as to true propitiation and atonement now.<a name=461:18></a> I have had one side of this point with Waldenstrm.<a name=461:19></a>

		[To the same.<a name=462:1></a>] F S Monk, I agree with you that people are quite free to use human words to express their apprehension of what is in scripture, as Trinity, etc.<a name=462:2></a>, and feel that, in general, rejecting the word is rejecting the thing:<a href="#462:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> 'the judgment of sin' is quite as objectionable, and if I have used it has generally been with qualifying words .<a name=462:3></a>.<a name=462:4></a>.<a name=462:5></a> .<a name=462:6></a> I do not propose at present taking any step: when a word comes into controversy it is then well to use what scripture uses, and ascertain what the person really means.<a name=462:7></a> The addition of the word 'or atonement'<a href="#462:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a> is what would trouble me most in it; for if scripture avoids the word, it would be that it might not be supposed that He was personally so.<a name=462:8></a> But I do not think that the author's intention was to deny what we mean by atonement.<a name=462:9></a> It is regrettable that the word propitiation, at least, was not used.<a name=462:10></a> But I regret the article greatly.<a name=462:11></a> The Lord is above it all, but I am conscious Satan is making a great set at brethren just now.<a name=462:12></a> But it is a mercy it is all out.<a name=462:13></a>

		There never was a time when the true real, atoning sufferings, the reality of His bearing our sins, making propitiation, drinking the cup, being made a curse for us, and all that wrath lying upon us involved, was more necessary to insist on than now.<a name=462:21></a> It is loosened in England and is upsetting the work in Sweden.<a name=462:22></a> I should take care to give no handle, by any word I used, to cavillers, but should insist on maintaining the blessed Lord's drinking that dreadful cup when forsaken of God.<a name=462:23></a> Indeed it is for this I have been attacked, as distinguishing that as something more than the act of dying -- though that were true, too, and till He had taken its sting out by drinking the cup, involved it all.<a name=462:24></a> In the plain sense of simple Christians convinced of sin, they know that He took on Him what lay on them; and Psalm 88 authorises the word wrath itself
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Scripture is wiser even in its expressions than we are; but to hold fast the real truth of atoning sufferings and bearing sins is vital.<a name=462:25></a> But 1 do not think they meant to weaken this.<a name=462:26></a> Only there remains the question how far a deep conviction of sin has made the need felt, for that is often at the bottom of these things.<a name=462:27></a>

		John 15 is clearly not union with Christ, as understood of Christians united by the Holy Ghost to a glorified Christ.<a name=463:5></a> For Christ was not glorified, was not the Head of the body, and the Holy Ghost had not yet come, nor could till He was glorified.<a name=463:6></a> "Now ye are clean" should be "ye are already clean," and the unfruitful branches were to be broken off.<a name=463:7></a> Our church union with Christ is in heavenly places, and could not exist till Christ was there; the teaching of Ephesians 1 makes this definitely certain, and "he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.<a name=463:8></a>" So that true union with Christ could not be before Christ was glorified: redemption was not yet accomplished.<a name=463:9></a> The disciples were united to Christ as a teacher and as disciples (Judas was), and those who in John 6 left Him.<a name=463:10></a> But this has nothing to do with real union.<a name=463:11></a> He who thinks it has, does not yet know what true christian union is.<a name=463:12></a> We cannot be members of His body till He has the place of Head.<a name=463:13></a> Further more, His express testimony is, "Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abides alone.<a name=463:14></a>" John 15 refers to the vine brought out of Egypt, which was not the true one -- Christ on earth was, but branches fruit-bearing.<a name=463:15></a> Pruning has nothing to do with membership of His body in heavenly places.<a name=463:16></a> If they mean such a union -- more than connection in discipleship which might go further, as in the eleven in whom Christ knew life was (not the Holy Ghost) -- I repeat, they do not know what christian union is.<a name=463:17></a>

		[W G Heney] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- First as to your scriptures -- Hebrews 1: 2 and Genesis 1: 26 have quite a different force.<a name=465:12></a> Hebrews 1: 2 signifies that He was the express image, as the wax from a seal, of the spiritual being of God; something like (with the difference of speaking of the Father, which implies, when revealed, actual grace in exercise) "He that hath seen me hath seen the Father.<a name=465:13></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I should not, perhaps, have thought of taking Genesis 1: 26 as a direct proof of immortality; but it seems to me to involve it pretty conclusively.<a name=465:14></a> You never could think of a poor dying animal as made in the likeness and image of God.<a name=465:15></a> The truth itself is as plain as possible.<a name=465:16></a> A threat of death to one who would die at any rate would be an unintelligible thing.<a name=465:17></a> "In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die," could not be said to a creature that would die at any rate.<a name=465:18></a> And so the apostle understood it, that is the Spirit of God.<a name=465:19></a> "By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin": "as by man came death.<a name=465:20></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have always found it difficult to be precise as to Genesis 1: 26.<a name=465:21></a> Man was made to be the centre of a vast system placed under him, of its affections and reverence as one having dominion.<a name=465:22></a> There was the absence of evil.<a name=465:23></a> No angel was a centre and a head.<a name=465:24></a> Then there was a reflective [counterpart] of being and headship which no animal has.<a name=465:25></a> Everything down here was in relationship with him, and referred to him.<a name=465:26></a> No angel has this at all.<a name=465:27></a> It is fully developed in the second Man, of whom Adam was consequently the image.<a name=465:28></a> (Romans 5: 14) This was of course only in subjection to God, and so in His image.<a name=465:29></a> Likeness goes something further.<a name=465:30></a> It is put first with Seth; and image is left out by James.<a name=465:31></a> Image also represents, but is not necessarily like: the image of a god is not necessarily like him, though it must in some way represent him; though perfect likeness makes it an image -- as we say, he is the very image of his father.<a name=465:32></a> -I think there is, or rather was, as according to his created condition, a certain moral and mental likeness to God.<a name=465:33></a> He not only represents Him on earth, but thinks for others, refers to and delights in what God is -- not the knowledge of good and evil in himself, but delight in what is good -- has his moral place amongst those who do.<a name=465:34></a> This is likeness, not image; there is reflection, delight, love of goodness, beauty.<a name=465:35></a> I remember, when I was unconverted, the sense of beauty in creation made me feel I must have to say to God.<a name=465:36></a> Eating and drinking was, no doubt, as really a created state, but it was a brute's state, and had not in mind to do with God.<a name=465:37></a> Hence we say, when 'the reflective sense of good is lost, a man is brutalised -- which is not a question of conversion: then God is known in holiness.<a name=465:38></a>

		Have you remarked how, in Acts 2, the Lord received the Holy Ghost anew for others when exalted?<a name=467:22></a> This is the starting-point of Christianity -- was historically and is actually: Man in a wholly new position, consequent on redemption perfectly accomplished, and thence the Holy Ghost come down to connect us with it.<a name=467:23></a> This gives the full character of Christianity -- a glorified Man in heaven, and the Holy Ghost come down to earth (that is to believers, for the world cannot receive Him) while we wait for Him from heaven to take us actually there.<a name=467:24></a> We belong to a new creation, but have the treasure of it in a body that belongs to the old.<a name=467:25></a> But the basis of all this is the Man in glory, Son of God, and the sending down of the Holy Ghost received by Him ill that position.<a name=467:26></a> As to the earthly part of it, see 1 Peter 1: 10-13.<a name=467:27></a> The Holy Ghost had wrought in creation, in the fathers, in judges, in the prophets; but His coming was consequent on Man being in glory, Son of God, past sin (as borne), death, Satan's power, judgment -- having in that glorified God in a way which brought Him as a Man into glory by God's righteousness; and He is therefore ours.<a name=467:28></a> It is of deep interest in connection with this -- what is said in John 1: 33.<a name=467:29></a>

		[G Glenny] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- First your questions.<a name=468:1></a> Ezekiel's temple is not the temple built by the Jews in unbelief.<a name=468:2></a> It is all by divine measurement, directions given how the prince is to come in when all is in order, connected with the permanent division of the land in its proper place in connection with the city, and from that day the city is to be called, "The Lord is there.<a name=468:3></a>" It is possible that they try and imitate it in unbelief; but their temple will be destroyed, their service there is rejected.<a name=468:4></a> (Isaiah 66) Still, even so, there will be a temple then.<a name=468:5></a> (verse 6) And here I would remark, that the house under all circumstances is accounted one and the same house.<a name=468:6></a> In Haggai it should be "the latter glory of this house," not "latter house"; literally, "the glory of this house shall be greater, the latter than the former.<a name=468:7></a>" See Psalm 74 for the ruin of theirs.<a name=468:8></a> I know of no prophetic scriptures referring to Herod's temple.<a name=468:9></a> It is said he built it over the then temple, leaving the Ezra one and its service going on till all was finished, but it was always the same house.<a name=468:10></a> Neither Ezra's nor Herod's were subjects of prophecy that I know of.<a name=468:11></a> Daniel 9: 24 takes in the whole period, but does not take in the temple.<a name=468:12></a> Zechariah 4 identifies Ezra's temple with the end.<a name=468:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There were clearly two cleansings of the temple: the one in John 2 was before the Lord entered on His public ministry, for John was not yet cast into prison.<a name=468:14></a> (John 3: 24.<a name=468:15></a> Compare Mark 1: 14, 15.<a name=468:16></a>) The second was when He went up the last time to Jerusalem to be crucified, and had ridden into Jerusalem as Messiah.<a name=468:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We were all thankful to hear of you, and I bless the Lord with all my heart that He has led you by a right way.<a name=468:18></a> "If one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with" him; besides it is pleasant in these last days to see the gracious Lord working in the grace that none can hinder.<a name=468:19></a> He is doing so everywhere: in Germany and Russia, in Sweden and Norway, in the States, too, His work is spreading.<a name=468:20></a> There is considerable blessing, and to see this in the midst of corruption and infidelity is a great relief of heart, and subject of praise to Him.<a name=468:21></a> It seems to point out the speedy coming of the Lord.<a name=468:22></a> It is not that I look for any signs; I await His coming with desire; but He says, "How is it that ye do not discern this time?<a name=468:23></a>" At any rate, our hearts ought to be waiting for Him with longing desire, though with patience -- for we have need of it that after we have done the will of God we should inherit the promises -- and meanwhile never be weary in well-doing.<a name=468:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I feel it of all importance that we should evangelise.<a name=468:25></a> I quite recognise the difference of gifts, and we cannot appropriate what is not given; still there is a love to souls, the love of Christ constraining us, which is an important element in our own state.<a name=468:26></a> I feel it as to myself.<a name=468:27></a> I do not doubt I fail in everything, but in a certain sense my heart is filled with the desire of the blessing of the church, of Christ's glory in it, for that I could spend myself with His grace; but love to sinners' souls -- I could not say I have none, and I anxiously evangelise when I can; but it does not press on my spirit like the other; yet I constantly see that a meeting goes on well when the love of souls is there.<a name=468:28></a> The same Christ does both.<a name=468:29></a> The Lord be abundantly with you, and give you grace, and courage, and wisdom, for it is all His.<a name=468:30></a> The great point is to be nearer Him in heart than even the work, and then we do the work from Him, and in some measure as He would.<a name=468:31></a>

		[E R Storey] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- There is no doubt but Edom is the special object of judgment in the last days; but the passages you quote refer to the time when Israel will be in their land, and the Lord has come down to judgment.<a name=470:1></a> Though Ezekiel 35 refers directly to the time of the Babylonish captivity, when Edom who was rival of Jacob rejoiced cruelly in the desolation of Jerusalem.<a name=470:2></a> Though it go on to the final desolation of Mount Seir, Isaiah 63 is clearly Christ's personal coming.<a name=470:3></a> Isaiah 34 is equally entirely at the end.<a name=470:4></a> You can look at Psalm 83 for the conspiracy that leads to this final judgment.<a name=470:5></a> Genesis 36 is merely the original historical condition of Esau.<a name=470:6></a> That Russia's possession of Togarmah, or north-eastern Asia Minor, will help her on.<a name=470:7></a> to Palestine I do not doubt, and I suppose that is doing now, though I do not see the newspapers, and do not know how they have settled it .<a name=470:8></a>.<a name=470:9></a>.<a name=470:10></a> .<a name=470:11></a>

		I have no doubt the Lord is leading you in the right way; He always does, He may stop us if we go our own, but He makes all things work together for good to them that love Him.<a name=470:12></a> I have no doubt your lying aside a while for your family will be a blessing, and mature you in your own soul for work.<a name=470:13></a> Do not lose sight of work, however.<a name=470:14></a> Wait patiently till God opens the way, but keep it in view.<a name=470:15></a> It is all right you should support your family.<a name=470:16></a> It is God's way, too, to set people aside after their first start, that self-confidence may die down.<a name=470:17></a> Thus Moses was forty years.<a name=470:18></a> On his first start he had to run away.<a name=470:19></a> Paul was three years also, after his first testimony, before he entered on his work as sent.<a name=470:20></a> Not that God did not approve the first earnest testimony.<a name=470:21></a> In both cases He did, but we see how Moses, at any rate, carried much of the flesh with him into it, and then afterwards was afraid to go on; but, after all, when he was before Pharaoh there was neither: he stood in God's name and power.<a name=470:22></a> We must get to know ourselves and that we have no strength; for in the end of Romans vii.<a name=470:23></a> is learning that we have no strength.<a name=470:24></a> So in 2 Corinthians 12, Paul has to learn his own weakness that the power of Christ may rest upon him: and this conscious weakness only casts itself on the Lord.<a name=470:25></a> When Paul went to Corinth it was thus it began, "I was with you in weakness and fear and in much trembling"; but the Lord had a great people there.<a name=470:26></a> Thus we must learn, and then leaning on the Lord we can with more maturity, and more experimentally, deal with souls .<a name=470:27></a>.<a name=470:28></a>.<a name=470:29></a> .<a name=470:30></a>

		Dear Dr.<a name=471:1></a> Cronin, -- Though my days go so quietly by that I have little to tell, and my work is one which gives little room for anything in the shape of news, I write a line to give some account of myself and keep up my intercourse with brethren.<a name=471:2></a> I am hard at work with the translation.<a name=471:3></a> I feel I have the Lord with me, and that I had His will in coming here, and that is always a great comfort-comfort in present service, and comfort as to that which elsewhere you have to leave to God.<a name=471:4></a> I know well we have all to leave to Him always and everywhere, and that He alone does all that is good; but the heart can do so when we are in the path of His will.<a name=471:5></a>

		[Mr Bagshaw] BELOVED BROTHER, -- I was very glad to hear from you, and always am, from the beloved brethren who are at the work, though in my constant but so similar work one day with another, I may have nothing very interesting to answer.<a name=475:1></a> At this moment I am occupied in a special way, translating the Old Testament into French.<a name=475:2></a> I feel I am at the Lord's work, so that I am through grace very happy.<a name=475:3></a> I preach and lecture naturally too, but have less active service.<a name=475:4></a> But I can tell you something of the brethren.<a name=475:5></a> And, in general, thank God, the account is happy.<a name=475:6></a> I think the brethren were in a critical state but I believe the Lord has been working in grace.<a name=475:7></a> In several places where there was trial, blessing seems to be springing up.<a name=475:8></a> I do not think we have all arrived, even at what our poor hearts could desire; but if He is at work the heart can rejoice, and look for more blessing.<a name=475:9></a> I feared the world for them; and, on the one side, incapacity to meet cases of discipline, which left all in disorder; and, on another, loss of spiritual power so that the testimony was weakened, and therewith some setting up a claim of high attainment without knowing themselves.<a name=475:10></a> But God is ever faithful, and when He works none can hinder: some were inclined to settle things, and things are never settled till souls are.<a name=475:11></a> I have not interfered, for what was wanting was the Lord's working, and as to ministry -- what would raise the whole tone was, as far as God enabled me, what was really the profitable thing.<a name=475:12></a> Where I chiefly was we were, thank God, getting on very happily and unitedly, and there was a good deal of attendance of persons seeking the grace and truth that is in Christ.<a name=475:13></a> It is a great thing to trust God and look to Him; it carries you through everything.<a name=475:14></a> But the brethren still want stirring up to more spiritual life, which One only can give.<a name=475:15></a> God's truth for these last days they have, though of course there is always need of fresh apprehensions of scripture to feed and lead on the soul.<a name=475:16></a> But what I look for all of them is a heart devoted to God, to Christ who suffered for us here below -- the blessed One we wait to see.<a name=475:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have been struck lately with the difference of Paul's writings and John's, or rather with how little Paul speaks of the Father.<a name=475:18></a> The way in which John presents God to us, and Paul us to God, had been before our minds, but I had not applied it particularly to this point; and I had been occupied with the Father's revelation of Himself lately, and how far hymns could be addressed to Him, and then I found that Paul puts us clearly in liberty before Him -- the Lord be praised for it!<a name=475:19></a> -- giving the Spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba, Father, but never Him distinctly before us.<a name=475:20></a> John does both in the gospel and epistle: it is Himself -- known through Christ and by the Spirit; but it is "the Father himself loveth you.<a name=475:21></a>" This is another thought and relationship; and the difference is very practical for our state and affections.<a name=475:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As you have been long away, I add what we have had before us: how the apostle, in Romans, gives us man, still a living man on earth, but Christ his life and justified, having the Holy Ghost so as to know his position.<a name=475:23></a> Then the exhortation is to give ourselves up a living sacrifice to God as transformed.<a name=475:24></a> Colossians we are risen with Christ, not only a new life but a new state, "meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light," but not there -- life (not the Holy Ghost) but it is a hope in heaven, and the exhortation is that we may seek the things which are above where Christ sits -- say, like Christ the forty days before the ascension.<a name=475:25></a> In Ephesians we are sitting in heavenly places in Him, and the Holy Ghost in us.<a name=475:26></a> Hence the exhortation is to come out and shew the character of God as revealed in Christ.<a name=475:27></a> (Ephesians 4, 5) Then there is another difference: Christ is only seen as raised from the dead, and we not as dead in Him, and having had to die and rise again, but as wholly dead in sins, and then a new creation: hence God's counsels.<a name=475:28></a> The Colossians only just touches this, and does not of course take us to heaven.<a name=475:29></a> The wilderness makes no part of the counsels of God, but of His ways with us.<a name=475:30></a> We are completely brought to God by redemption -- so after the Red Sea at Sinai.<a name=475:31></a> Then come exercises of every kind, whether in or out of Canaan, in the world or in heavenly places.<a name=475:32></a> The true knowledge of the Father is in the affections, in relationship.<a name=475:33></a> It is goodness, love -- not in the kind of sympathetic exercises and experiences into which Christ is entered for us; we may be in them, and the Father's love known -- but it is in another -- love of experience and more absolute.<a name=475:34></a> Hymns, you will find, do not run on this theme.<a name=475:35></a>

		[G Biava] [From the Italian.<a name=478:1></a>] DEAR BRETHREN, -- The question treated of in your letter is not a new one; it is too of great importance.<a name=478:2></a> But there is a fundamental error in your reasoning, as if faith in a human testimony, with respect to temporal things, was the same thing as faith that receives the word of God in the heart.<a name=478:3></a> There is no enmity in the heart against temporal things, but "the mind of the flesh is enmity against God.<a name=478:4></a>" You say that man if he wished could believe, but he never wishes, because the object of faith is hateful to him; and, further, if he believed with this natural faith only, it would be worth nothing.<a name=478:5></a> Many believed in Jesus (John 2: 23, 24), but Jesus had no confidence in this faith.<a name=478:6></a> You forget that the one who believes with a true faith has everlasting life.<a name=478:7></a> (John 3: 36.<a name=478:8></a>) See 1 John 5: 15.<a name=478:9></a> Likewise, they are not born of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but they are born of God.<a name=478:10></a> And therefore it is said (Galatians 3: 26), "Ye are children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.<a name=478:11></a>" Now this true faith, the fruit of the operation of the Holy Ghost, has not been found in any man.<a name=478:12></a> It is said (Isaiah 1: 2), "Wherefore when I came was there no man?<a name=478:13></a>" John the Baptist says (John 3: 32), "And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth: and no man receiveth his testimony;" also the Lord Himself says (chapter 3: 11), "We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen, and ye receive not our witness.<a name=478:14></a>" That it is the work of God is clear according to the word (James 1: 18), "Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth.<a name=478:15></a>" In Galatians we read (1: 15), "When it pleased God .<a name=478:16></a>.<a name=478:17></a>.<a name=478:18></a> to reveal his Son in me.<a name=478:19></a>" God gives us eternal life.<a name=478:20></a> "He that hath the Son hath life," says the apostle John.<a name=478:21></a> "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit" -- an entirely new thing in man.<a name=478:22></a> Christ Himself is our life, and we have not this life before receiving Christ.<a name=478:23></a> The testimony, then, is clear and certain that we are children of God through faith, and born, not of the will of man but of God.<a name=478:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You say that he has faith -- 'may it not be that he opens his hand to receive?<a name=478:25></a>' But hearts are not so disposed; they will not open the hand.<a name=478:26></a> Everything is done, as far as the heart is concerned, when it is disposed to receive Christ.<a name=478:27></a> He complains that when He came there was no man.<a name=478:28></a> You acknowledge that he has salvation, but, if a man is disposed to open his hand, conversion comes from the will of man.<a name=478:29></a> You say that as soon as a man believes we find that God renews his mind.<a name=478:30></a> But, if he believes, it is already renewed, since Christ is precious to him, while before he saw no beauty in Him that he should desire Him; already he knows that he is a sinner, and needs a Saviour, and he has found Him if he believes.<a name=478:31></a> Observe that Jesus says, "You will not come.<a name=478:32></a>" I believe fully that they are responsible for it; but where do you find, You will?<a name=478:33></a> The word of God expressly says, No.<a name=478:34></a> "There is none that seeketh after God.<a name=478:35></a>" He came to seek them, thank God, but when He came He was rejected; He was not received save by those who are born of God.<a name=478:36></a> This is said by the Spirit in Isaiah 1, by John the Baptist, by the Lord, and by the apostle John.<a name=478:37></a> Now certainly God does not hinder any one from coming, but such is the disposition of the heart of man that he will not.<a name=478:38></a> This is why the work of God is necessary, and why it is said, "No man can come unto me except the Father which hath sent me draw him.<a name=478:39></a>" Perhaps you will say, Every one is drawn.<a name=478:40></a> No, because the one who is drawn comes, and Jesus will raise him up at the last day: he is saved, see John 6: 39.<a name=478:41></a> Therefore it is said (verse 37), "All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.<a name=478:42></a>" The Lord then expressly says what you say He does not say, "No man can come to me except the Father which hath sent me draw him," and He repeats (verse 65), "Therefore said I unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my Father.<a name=478:43></a>" Also it is written, "But ye do not believe, because ye are not of my sheep.<a name=478:44></a> My sheep hear my voice .<a name=478:45></a>.<a name=478:46></a>.<a name=478:47></a> and I give unto them eternal life, and they shall never perish.<a name=478:48></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now as to the passage in Ephesians 2, it is very simple.<a name=478:49></a> What is said of the neuter is this: the adversaries of this truth say that tou'to ("that") cannot agree with "faith," because the latter is feminine; but in the same way it cannot agree with "grace" ( cavri") because it is feminine.<a name=478:50></a> Then they say, It is true, but it agrees with the whole thing, salvation; but this has no sense.<a name=478:51></a> "By grace ye are saved through faith, and that (this salvation) not of yourselves, it is the gift of God.<a name=478:52></a>" Certainly salvation by grace is not of ourselves, otherwise it would not be grace -- impossible to suppose that grace is of myself, so that in this case "and that" has no meaning.<a name=478:53></a> But it may well be supposed that faith is of ourselves, as you say; therefore when he has said that it is by faith he adds, "and that, not of yourselves, it is the gift of God.<a name=478:54></a>" In short, by true faith we have life; we are children of God; but this is so because we are born of the Spirit, who works in us, and produces faith when we are begotten of God by His own will.<a name=478:55></a> To be begotten of God is by His operation, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit; but seeing that it is by the word, and by means of faith (the Spirit gives to the word the divine power which produces life, as the incorruptible seed of the living God enduring for ever), the word of God becomes the revelation of His Son in us, and Christ thus received is our life.<a name=478:56></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not believe, dear brethren, what you say of Adam in innocence, but I do not seek controversy.<a name=478:57></a> I have sought to lay bare the truth, as I find it in the scriptures.<a name=478:58></a> I would desire to draw your attention to one single thing: you say that Adam was able to discern good and evil, but the word says expressly that this came in by his fall.<a name=478:59></a> May God our Father in Christ instruct us in all the truth.<a name=478:60></a>

		MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I do not occupy myself with putting in articles into the different journals: I fear there are too many, and though, I doubt not, often useful, I doubt a little if they have the freshness of the first, when truth was first blooming out, or the maturity which a good many years might seem calculated to produce.<a name=481:19></a> But on the point you write about [2 Corinthians 6: 14] I cannot hesitate a moment in stating what I feel.<a name=481:20></a>

		Neither the warnings nor the motives confine themselves to worship, nor even have they any particular application that I can see.<a name=481:21></a> Chapter 6: 1 is as large as can be.<a name=481:22></a> The principles of verses 14-17 are as general and absolute as possible.<a name=481:23></a> Christ has no accord with Belial anywhere, nor the temple of God with idols.<a name=481:24></a> God does not walk in our midst only in worship.<a name=481:25></a> I am not to touch unclean things everywhere, not in worship merely: I am not to touch it anywhere, because we form the temple of the living God.<a name=481:26></a> Being yoked is not worship: it is everything that brings us to community of thought and moral judgment.<a name=481:27></a> It is a question of receiving -- being owned as -- sons and daughters, not of worship.<a name=481:28></a> I do not see a trace of any application to worship in the passage, but of everything which puts two to pull together where moral principles are concerned.<a name=481:29></a> "Perfecting holiness in the fear of God" is the conclusion.<a name=481:30></a>

		[S O M Cluff] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I must tell you that I have never adequately read the articles in the Voice, to give you an exact answer, and in what I have there is such thorough obscurity in the important passages that it is not easy to lay fast hold of their import; they are the statements of one who has never thoroughly digested and realised his own thoughts.<a name=482:1></a> It is only last week that I read the larger number of them.<a name=482:2></a> These I had at least a month ago; they had been sent to me anonymously.<a name=482:3></a> But I would not delay answering a letter so kindly written, and give you what is now with some distinctness on my mind.<a name=482:4></a> Further inquiry may enable me to speak with more detail.<a name=482:5></a> But there is another point I must refer to.<a name=482:6></a> If the effect in all those under the teaching is substantially the same, though it would be unjust to charge all the particular statements on the teacher, we are as much concerned before God with the result in souls even the weakest dear to Him, as in the particular ideas of the teacher.<a name=482:7></a> It is something which produces that effect.<a name=482:8></a> Now I always found the effect produced by this teaching to be, not Christ before the soul, but itself.<a name=482:9></a> They had got something wonderfully new and beautiful, what was not heavenly (that was common) but divine; and where Christ was spoken of, it was not Christ Himself, but Christ in them, conscious power of His life in them.<a name=482:10></a> This was chiefly with women: men were more usually unhappy because they had not this gold, tried in the fire.<a name=482:11></a> The effect on others, 'convicted Laodiceans' -- for all were in Laodicea (a name nearer the truth than they thought), was that they were rich and increased in goods; others were to go down to Bethany too; they supped with Christ.<a name=482:12></a> I cannot say this seemed to me of God.<a name=482:13></a> It was themselves and Stradbally, not Christ.<a name=482:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was only here that I read the first three of the articles, the Pauline Epistles; and I shall now tell you what I find answering to the effect in souls, and often expressed by them, though sometimes obscurely, in them and the articles, Colossians being the principal alleged basis.<a name=482:15></a> Christ being our life (which no Christian, of course, objects to), we are livingly in Him, but He as man is in God, so we are in God.<a name=482:16></a> Our life is in God -- not hid in Christ there, but we alive in God -- so as all the fulness of the Godhead is in Him, and we are complete in Him, we are entered into this place, into this fulness which is in Him: connected with this is that we are not merely justified, but actually and livingly God's righteousness, we are it, we livingly.<a name=482:17></a> Now I have heard of this being stated much more crudely, and some of the statements in the articles are very obscure, but if they mean anything they mean that all is in the condition and state in which Christ is Himself; as He is, so are we.<a name=482:18></a> There is no mediatorial Christ.<a name=482:19></a> Now scripture never speaks of Christ in God.<a name=482:20></a> When Christ speaks distinctly as man, He says, "my God"; and so the Holy Ghost; "The God of our Lord Jesus Christ," etc.<a name=482:21></a> And I have always remarked that when we are placed in the same glory and acceptance -- as we are, or shall be -- what belongs to His Person is always carefully secured.<a name=482:22></a> Here we are put together.<a name=482:23></a> You would never find Christ saying to His disciples, "Our Father" -- a rightly formed christian mind would be deeply shocked at it -- though He says, "My Father and your Father.<a name=482:24></a>" As an inference man would say, we can thus say "our" -- not one taught of God.<a name=482:25></a> And this is what those who have received this teaching are come to, not these words, but this evil thing.<a name=482:26></a> It is such a connection with Christ in life, who is a man in God, that we are there too, only in heaven, dead not merely to sin but to nature; and, as far as I have found, it is always justified by such inference.<a name=482:27></a> A mediatorial Christ is lost by union.<a name=482:28></a> There is another point which I have not mastered, though it is in what I read connected with this -- righteousness in incorruptibility; of this, therefore, I cannot speak.<a name=482:29></a> But what I have stated is the real substance and root of the doctrine, and is wholly false -- not of God, though it may seem elevating and high.<a name=482:30></a> The very barrier that scripture has carefully put when speaking of our privileges, you have overstepped; and hence souls have got, not Christ all, but an exalted self.<a name=482:31></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Since this question has come before me, I will look through such of the articles as I can command.<a name=482:32></a> I never saw them until I came here.<a name=482:33></a> I have spoken plainly, because Christ and souls are in question, but I have not a trace of ungracious feeling: What would rouse souls to more devotedness would always be welcome to me, but we are sanctified by the truth.<a name=482:34></a> I write at once that I may meet the letter graciously sent me, but I will (D.<a name=482:35></a>V.<a name=482:36></a>) look further into the articles, though I have very little time; and if called for, as far as I judge, write again.<a name=482:37></a>

		[To the same.<a name=484:1></a>] S O M Cluff, That there is a wholly new creation of which the blessed Lord is Head; that there all is new; that in the moral sense the cross closed the history of the first man, and that all is new, the Second Man not mingled with the first; that we now reckon ourselves dead, and alive to God in Him, not in Adam; that forgiveness is not all; that justification in this character is not all, it applies to our responsibilities as belonging to the former estate, while there is a wholly new position of acceptance ending in glory, in our present estate in Christ -- is not what is in question.<a name=484:2></a> How far it is realised is a question with individual souls.<a name=484:3></a> That everything may be turned into mere doctrine, is alas!<a name=484:4></a> true; and I may add, that the cross and the glory answer to one another.<a name=484:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is more than this in your teaching: not mere careless expressions, or mistaken ones, to which we are all liable, but a formal systematic doctrine, not so clearly brought out in your printed papers, but which has taken possession of those taught by you, and is insisted on as something new and transcendently precious and beautiful -- and is something new, and wholly and mischievously false -- and runs through all your papers, though not so broadly stated as by those who are adepts in it, still quite clearly to one who can judge in such a case; not union with Christ, not being in Him, and He in us, but, He being in God, such an identification with Christ as makes us to be actual divine righteousness, as so identified with Him; He in God in the glory, but we partakers actually ourselves of divine righteousness and incorruptibility, which sustains us wholly above nature.<a name=484:6></a>

		'He is in the region of life hid with Christ in God; he enjoys the state and breathes the breath of the new creation.<a name=484:7></a>' (Voice, vol.<a name=484:8></a> 11, page 218) 'We behold the righteousness of God subsist in a living Person for our hearts; He is there -- He in whom we have become God's righteousness .<a name=484:9></a>.<a name=484:10></a>.<a name=484:11></a> .<a name=484:12></a> Righteousness is dwelling in life of new creation.<a name=484:13></a>' (page 221) See also pages 224, 163.<a name=484:14></a> 'Not only life, which might be said of the Old Testament saints, but incorruptibility -- the power of divine righteousness which sustains in the new creation place.<a name=484:15></a>' (page 73) 'We, having become God's righteousness in Christ, can bring forth fruit unto God, fruit unto holiness.<a name=484:16></a>' (page 74) 'As truly and really as we were constituted sinners, so are we truly and really constituted righteous as in Him who has become, in resurrection, the power of God to us.<a name=484:17></a> Christ Himself, risen in victor-strength, is to be known in the saint as really as he felt the terrible power of evil in his Adam-state.<a name=484:18></a> There is actual positive righteousness, not only justification by faith.<a name=484:19></a> It is established in the cross, and in virtue of the work done there it flows down with glory in its train, and lifts Man out of death, and sets Him to be its own channel from and in glory.<a name=484:20></a> That Man, crucified in weakness, is exhibited as God's Son in power, according to the Spirit of holiness.<a name=484:21></a>' (page 313) Then in page 314: Having received 'the gift of righteousness,' .<a name=484:22></a>.<a name=484:23></a>.<a name=484:24></a> the believer 'enjoys life in righteousness.<a name=484:25></a>' All this is error.<a name=484:26></a> Resurrection is not looked at in scripture as victor-strength in man, but as a divine act towards man; though Christ, as being God, could do it.<a name=484:27></a> You make it a new kind of power in man: that we are partakers of this power, the source being in Christ on high, and that this being in us in life is righteousness.<a name=484:28></a> This is the system which, starting from the truth that Christ is our life, has falsified the whole position of the Christian and of Christ.<a name=484:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I continue (page 361), 'The new man is in Him (Jesus) created after God in righteousness and true-holiness, righteousness as in power and place in God, to sustain us in light and glory where He is.<a name=484:30></a>' 'Thus we see our side of the new man as a throne of grace; and God's side the fountain of life and righteousness.<a name=484:31></a>' What follows I do not receive.<a name=484:32></a> How is the new man a "throne of grace"?<a name=484:33></a> That -- "throne of grace" -- is Hebrews' doctrine, but I do not enter on it here.<a name=484:34></a> But by this system what Christ is falsified: He is a man in God.<a name=484:35></a> Righteousness, divine righteousness, is falsified: it is an actual thing in us, not Christ made it to us, or we in Him, but we made it through His being livingly in us: our place is falsified too; as He is, so are we, in present moral elevation: resurrection is falsified, as an intrinsic power in Christ as Man -- life out of death consequent on death to sin, and so reproduced in us in conscious power through Him -- not the act of God; and made life out of death to sin and self, not out of death in sins, or with Him as risen consequent on His death, as scripture does; so that the new creation is falsified too.<a name=484:36></a> All this exalts man in himself, while professing to do the contrary; but I continue (page 332): 'We are seen in Him in heaven .<a name=484:37></a>.<a name=484:38></a>.<a name=484:39></a> consequently we are in conflict with the devil and his host there.<a name=484:40></a>' This is all a mistake: He, Christ, at the right hand of God, is not the place of conflict.<a name=484:41></a> 'Co-quickened with Him in the same righteousness (2 Corinthians 5: 21).<a name=484:42></a>' (page 333.<a name=484:43></a>) There is no such statement or thought in scripture; it is the system of divine righteousness in actuality in us.<a name=484:44></a> 2 Corinthians 5: 21 says nothing about quickening or co-quickening with Him.<a name=484:45></a> So in page 332, 'justified by faith' is accompanied by no hint of Christ's work.<a name=484:46></a> Scripture says, "delivered for our offences, and raised again for our justification; therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God.<a name=484:47></a>" This you leave out and add, 'enjoying the justification of life -- the power of righteousness actually known in the vessel on earth.<a name=484:48></a>' Nor is 'the power of righteousness,' that I can think of, a scriptural expression or thought, and at any rate not as the ground of peace before God.<a name=484:49></a> It makes our state the ground, not the work of Christ, nor His acceptance before God.<a name=484:50></a> Press our realising life and divine things in power excellent -- but this alters the basis of our relationship with God.<a name=484:51></a> The expression even of "justification of life" is quite in connection with another thought, and spoken of where all is made carefully to depend on one Man's obedience; so that the apostle has to guard against misuse of it in what follows by unfolding the new life; and in the passage itself the present effect of life is left out.<a name=484:52></a> In page 335 there is the same neglect of attention to scripture through following our own ideas: we get 'the living power of Him who subsists in divine righteousness.<a name=484:53></a>''To find Him, know Him,' etc.<a name=484:54></a> Now it is the power of God, and Christ is looked at exclusively as a raised man by God, and we with Him, and set in Him in heavenly places.<a name=484:55></a> There is no power spoken of in Christ, or in us.<a name=484:56></a> The whole of what is said on Ephesians 1: 13 is a falsification of the sense of the passage; as on chapter 2 (page 337): of all you find in it, there is not a trace, not even as an object sought; it is by grace we have been saved, for God's glory in the ages to come: nor is even the second prayer truly stated.<a name=484:57></a> (page 338)

		Dear C McAdam, -- .<a name=496:1></a>.<a name=496:2></a>.<a name=496:3></a> They tell me you have been quite ill with people's going on, and I had seen that you were discouraged.<a name=496:4></a> This is all wrong; the blessed Lord is just as full of love and as faithful as ever.<a name=496:5></a> This was my confidence before leaving London, for there mainly it was that my spirit passed through all the evil that has been going on, though partly here too; then I trusted in the dark, and simply on Him, and that stayed my soul.<a name=496:6></a> Now light seems to rise up in the darkness; the actings of God are manifest, have been, I think, for some time, though a deep-rooted evil is not cleared away all at once.<a name=496:7></a> But the Lord is, I think, evidently at work.<a name=496:8></a> His means are not His result, and we sometimes stop at them, but I believe He is working and will bring all out according to what is needed.<a name=496:9></a> His ways are "in the sea," but always "in the sanctuary.<a name=496:10></a>" I believe and know that the testimony given to what are called brethren, is God's testimony, and He will not give it up.<a name=496:11></a> They might be deprived of it, but I do not think He will even do that: He is full of goodness.<a name=496:12></a> I have long felt that their existence was in question, and all the talk about Philadelphia and the rest, as if they were it, a proof that they were getting Laodicean.<a name=496:13></a> Well, they are getting sifted -- sorrowful, no doubt, but a great mercy, and it will be great good to them; they will be more serious, more humble.<a name=496:14></a> Even their actual state is, of the two, more hopeful than I had been as to it; but God's testimony I leave, as I always left it, with Him.<a name=496:15></a> But I believe He is working for good; and if the evil has to be manifested before it is healed, it is so better, though of course sorrow in passing, and God is every way merciful and we are all poor things:

		H Talbot, I was very glad to hear of and from you and of your work, the rather as it is not very likely that I shall get to America again, though in fine weather it is rather a rest; but I am now in my seventy-ninth year.<a name=498:1></a> You will be interested to hear, as you find the opposition of the clergy, and especially to the Lord's coming, that in Constantinople they have preached against that and breaking of bread, and that this has set the Armenians much on the inquiry as to both.<a name=498:2></a> I have no enmity, thank God, against any; but this character of opposition we must expect to meet.<a name=498:3></a> But there is One who "openeth, and no man shutteth," and sets before the saints in the last days an open door, even if we have but little strength .<a name=498:4></a>.<a name=498:5></a>.<a name=498:6></a> .<a name=498:7></a> I do not speak of it now, when I do, as a point to be proved, but as a part of christian truth, as much as the atonement, though not like it the foundation of grace: but they were converted to wait for His Son from heaven.<a name=498:8></a> In that congress (at New York )as far as I know of it, the presence of the Holy Ghost was, says -- , wholly left out.<a name=498:9></a> But these are the two truths brought out in these days, throwing much light on the truth of the first coming.<a name=498:10></a> They have been consciously my theme these fifty years and more.<a name=498:11></a> They started me in my path of service; the assurance of salvation came with them, and the christian character as of the new creation, "like unto men that wait for their Lord.<a name=498:12></a>" When man entered into the glory of God consequent on accomplished redemption, the Holy Ghost came down, till He comes to take us up.<a name=498:13></a> This connects the hope and the power of life and heavenly calling with accomplished redemption: Christ, Man at the right hand of God, is the central point.<a name=498:14></a> What set me free in 1827 is still the theme on which my soul dwells, with, I trust, much deeper sense of its importance -- something much nearer to me, but the same truths.<a name=498:15></a> And blessed truths they are; and the hope, what a hope!<a name=498:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have to seek, amidst all that is passing around us, to minister positive truth and blessing, Christ and what is eternal; and for that we must live of Him, and with Him too, and not much mind what passes around us, save as God brings it before our eyes.<a name=498:17></a> It is Christ -- the positive good -- the world wants, and saints too.<a name=498:18></a> Thus in the congress at New York there was the positive good of bringing the coming of the Lord publicly forward; but there were all sorts of heretics there, and persons deliberately hindering the truth in seeking to connect it with the world and the camp -- avowing it if the account is to be believed -- leaving out the essential point of the presence of the Holy Ghost.<a name=498:19></a> Let us be content to be little and despised, but give out the full truth.<a name=498:20></a> The present great truth, redemption being known, is the presence of the Holy Ghost, what made it expedient Christ should leave the disciples; the future truth -- in present hope -- the coming of the Lord for the saints, and then in His own rights over the world; to sinners -- as plain and complete a gospel as possible, and the time is short.<a name=498:21></a> Meanwhile we have to watch, to walk in love and self-judgment in patience, to be enough with Christ to bring a love which is above the evil into the midst of the evil in holiness.<a name=498:22></a> That is what Christ was, and that we have to seek to be.<a name=498:23></a> I do not doubt, dear brother, God enables you to do it better than me, but I dwell on it as that which passes through my mind as that which we need.<a name=498:24></a>

		England has tried me more than any one will ever know but One; but it has been good for me, and I have felt that we are to rejoice in the Lord always, and to be careful for nothing, and to count on Him who never fails, and He has not failed.<a name=498:25></a> How could How I have unclouded confidence in His faithfulness to the end.<a name=498:26></a> With all this the Lord is working everywhere; and we have to think of what is of praise and is lovely and of good report, and find the God of- peace with us.<a name=498:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In general, the work has made considerable progress in the United States.<a name=498:28></a> But all over the world the Spirit of God is working, and it awakes the bright hope that the blessed Lord is soon coming.<a name=498:29></a> The Lord be with you, dear brother, and with yours, and sustain you by His own presence in your work!<a name=498:30></a>

		What makes me write now is to recall to you, though you know it, that you must be careful to keep in charity.<a name=500:5></a> The heart may revolt at what is dishonest, but "the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God"; but those who are God's children we ought to think of as such, and we shall yearn over them for their good.<a name=500:6></a> This does not give indecision, but makes us see more clearly what we have to deal with as from God.<a name=500:7></a> I feel I have to watch myself in these conflicts.<a name=500:8></a> I have more than once asked myself -- not in this case -- how should I feel in meeting such or such an one at the door of heaven.<a name=500:9></a> All I know will be perfect then, but it tests us now.<a name=500:10></a> We ought to be able to pray for each one, though in new of the whole state of things -- not falsifying the state of things; but what characterises good in God as towards us, is that His good is above evil.<a name=500:11></a> We have to keep near Him that it may be so, but then it (His presence) sustains us through all .<a name=500:12></a>.<a name=500:13></a>.<a name=500:14></a> .<a name=500:15></a> Walk in patience, doing only what God gives you to do.<a name=500:16></a> He is, I doubt not, working, and He does things much better than we can.<a name=500:17></a> But in patience, and letting God act, be as decided in conscience as possible, for I doubt not Satan is doing his best -- nor can I say any one has deceived me in the part they have taken (many I did not know) -- to destroy, by morally undermining, the testimony of God.<a name=500:18></a> Walk in peace; but one must be before God to do it.<a name=500:19></a>

		[G Biava] [From the Italian.<a name=501:1></a>] DEAR BROTHER, -- I am much pleased with the article on free will; I do not find that there is much to add to it.<a name=501:2></a> All depends on the depth of the conviction that we have of our sinful condition; and security and joy depend on it likewise.<a name=501:3></a> Lost and saved answer the one to the other: our condition in the old man, and our condition in Christ.<a name=501:4></a> But in the reasoning of Arminians there is a totally false principle, namely that our responsibility depends on our power.<a name=501:5></a> If I have lent &pound;100,000 to any one, and he has squandered it all, certainly he is not able to pay, but has his responsibility come to an end with his ability?<a name=501:6></a> Certainly not.<a name=501:7></a> Responsibility depends on the right of the person who has lent it to him, not on the ability of the one who has wrongfully wasted the money.<a name=501:8></a> If man can make use of his free will, it must be either to keep the law, or to receive Christ.<a name=501:9></a> Salvation is not by the law: if righteousness had come, or could come by the law, Christ has died in vain But it is said expressly that the flesh "is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.<a name=501:10></a>" The conscience indeed owns that the law is righteous and good: to be subject to it and to keep it, is quite another thing.<a name=501:11></a> Even if "to will is present" the man is a slave, and the doing does not follow But the will is not there: the approval of the conscience, as has been already said, but not the will; the latter desires to be independent of God.<a name=501:12></a> Does the law accept such a disposition?<a name=501:13></a> Free -- yes from God's side; but man desires to be free, that is to be able to do his own will.<a name=501:14></a> But this is not obedience.<a name=501:15></a> The law requires obedience; "The mind of the flesh is enmity against God.<a name=501:16></a>" A heathen could say, Video meliora proboque; deteriora sequor ('I see and approve the good; I follow the evil').<a name=501:17></a> All men have a conscience, the knowledge of good and evil, since the fall; they know how to distinguish, but that says nothing as to the will; so that since the law demands obedience, and the flesh cannot be subject, to receive the law is in fact an impossibility -- not that God hinders him, as I have already said, but because man does not wish it.<a name=501:18></a> Further, the law forbids lust, but fallen man has lust in his flesh; and it is in this way that the apostle knew sin.<a name=501:19></a> Man must lose his nature before being disposed to obey the law: it is therefore necessary to be born again.<a name=501:20></a> Now man cannot give himself divine and eternal life.<a name=501:21></a> Why then the law?<a name=501:22></a> In order that the offence might abound; by the law sin becomes "exceeding sinful"; "the law worketh" the righteous "wrath" of God against us -- not the fear of God in us; it does not give a new life, and that which we have is enmity against God.<a name=501:23></a> Man in the flesh cannot receive the law into his heart.<a name=501:24></a>

		[J B Rurkin] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- The doctrine you refer to<a href="#503:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> is widely spread enough.<a name=503:1></a> Zwingli held it: all the Wesleyans hold it and most of the national professors of Christianity.<a name=503:2></a> But it is founded on a want of depth and truth in the foundations, denying that we are all lost.<a name=503:3></a> The best answer is the very plain statements in the Epistle to the Romans, though these are confirmed by many others.<a name=503:4></a> But there is always a want of conviction of sin in these cases: man is not lost, not dead in trespasses and sins, and that is, I am not; for if I have deserved condemnation, it is no difficulty to think we all have.<a name=503:5></a> Hence grace, sin, the Lord's death, all lose their import and value and the real way of meeting it morally is to deal with the conscience of the individual.<a name=503:6></a> 'So to live that he might be saved' at once shews ignorance of the ways of God in grace -- in fact of the gospel, as regards Christ's work.<a name=503:7></a> 'Right convictions and good practice' is not gospel.<a name=503:8></a> Is he born again?<a name=503:9></a> Acts 17: 27 does not say a word of the Spirit's acting, and chapter 10: 35 says simply that he who is such and such is accepted; it was merely that blessing was not confined to the Jews, as is evident if the passage be read.<a name=503:10></a> Romans 2: 7, etc.<a name=503:11></a>, which is the strongest passage, supposes the truth of glory and resurrection known.<a name=503:12></a> If I found a Gentile so walking, he is as much saved as a Jew.<a name=503:13></a> But it is declared that every mouth is stopped, and all the world guilty before God, that "there is none righteous, no, not one.<a name=503:14></a>" The condemnation of the heathen is (Romans 1: 18 -- 3: 19) put upon a ground which negatives the idea of such an universal operation of the Spirit.<a name=503:15></a> They are, says the apostle, without excuse, on the double ground of having given up glorifying God when they knew Him, and the testimony of creation adding conscience: a reasoning perfectly futile, and without sense, if there was the other ground of condemnation, namely, that they have resisted the Holy Ghost.<a name=503:16></a> They that "have sinned without law shall also perish without law.<a name=503:17></a>" "The carnal mind is enmity against God," in me, as well as in any other one of the nations.<a name=503:18></a> People confound the ground of responsibility with sovereign grace in saving.<a name=503:19></a> Genesis 6: 3 refers merely to the patience of God in Noah's time.<a name=503:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Men are not saved by grace, if they are as thus stated; because, as the Spirit works alike on all (or the argument is nothing worth), the whole of salvation depends on man's acceptance of and acting on it.<a name=503:21></a> As I said at the beginning, our whole state, as scripture puts it, is denied.<a name=503:22></a> (See 2 Corinthians 5: 14, where the apostle draws the conclusion from grace.<a name=503:23></a> Compare Ephesians 2: 5) I do not believe the Gentiles more lost than I was myself.<a name=503:24></a> But "there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved" but the name of Jesus Christ.<a name=503:25></a> Romans 10: 13, 15 is positive as to the means.<a name=503:26></a> Judgment and condemnation is according to the means we have.<a name=503:27></a> What brings, by sovereign goodness, salvation to the lost is another thing.<a name=503:28></a> But, as I said, does he think himself lost?<a name=503:29></a> That is the real question.<a name=503:30></a> The source of thousands of opinions is the want of this, of conscience being before God; where it is not, the mind can have a thousand thoughts, all alike to no purpose.<a name=503:31></a> But I must close.<a name=503:32></a><br>[1879.<a name=503:33></a>]

		<a class="footnote" name="#503:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>"It has been said that 'God is love: He does not leave the poor heathen Without divine aid in their darkness. Though the Holy Ghost may not be in them as an indwelling Spirit, yet as external, He deals with the conscience of every human being; in the case of a heathen, aiding him towards right convictions and good practice, and helping him so to live that he may be saved, and this, though he may never have heard the name of Christ, and knows not the true God in Christ. Such texts as Acts 17: 27; 10: 36; Romans 2: 7; Genesis 6: 3, corroborate this view.' How does scripture meet this serious question?"

		[F A Humphrey] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I do not know that there need be much difference of thought in the statements<a href="#505:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> you make.<a name=505:1></a> The argument is the <i>a fortiori</i> argument which the Holy Ghost always uses -- rather, the way He always reasons downward from what God is and has done.<a name=505:2></a> Besides, there is the contrast here of our state: when we were enemies He reconciled us being reconciled He is not going to reject us then.<a name=505:3></a> His life does save us then along the pathway, but to the full result of salvation.<a name=505:4></a> His death, a thing outside us in grace, reconciled us to God; then in living actual power He secures our salvation.<a name=505:5></a> We have to be kept by God's power along the desert road and against the snares of the enemy.<a name=505:6></a> He ever lives for us as He once died for us, but then it results in the final salvation.<a name=505:7></a> To have us saved to the end in glory, He must keep us along the way, hence I say I do not know that the difference is very great.<a name=505:8></a>

		[S O M Cluff] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I have received your letter.<a name=505:9></a> The desire of your heart, to walk with the risen Christ, I have not doubted .<a name=505:10></a>.<a name=505:11></a>.<a name=505:12></a> .<a name=505:13></a>

		I do not know that I shall serve the Lord by saying a great deal.<a name=505:14></a> We are poor creatures, and if there be anything right and good, it is through Him, though, thank God, connected with life in us.<a name=505:15></a> The word is everything to us as means; Christ lived by it; gave up His spirit as soon as all was finished -- that the things concerning Him had an end.<a name=505:16></a> "How, then, shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?<a name=505:17></a>" "They knew not the scriptures, that he must rise again from the dead.<a name=505:18></a>" They are the mind of God Himself, expressed in a way suited to men.<a name=505:19></a> Christ was what He said, and what He said was what He was.<a name=505:20></a> Men will be judged by His words.<a name=505:21></a> Quite true, we need a new nature (itself by the word) and divine teaching to understand it; but what we understand is divine too.<a name=505:22></a> All the Holy Ghost reveals to us is ours.<a name=505:23></a> But all that is ours, as of God, must be revealed.<a name=505:24></a> I say this, that we may feel that all that is really of God in our minds is of the word; the rest nothing, or worse.<a name=505:25></a>

		I think you will yet see more as to the righteousness of God, when what it is to be in Christ is more unfolded to your soul.<a name=505:26></a> The righteousness of God is simply God's righteousness, a quality or attribute of His.<a name=505:27></a> We are made the righteousness of God in Him, because Christ would not see of the fruit of the travail of His soul, if He had us not thus with Him.<a name=505:28></a> But the display of God's righteousness is in His going to the Father, with the judicial part, that the world having rejected Him will see Him no more -- that is, come as Saviour.<a name=505:29></a>

		Where I see the soul delivered is when, having adequately learned, for it is experimental, that it has no strength at all, and there is no good in it, it is wholly off the ground of its Adam responsibility before God, and any responsibility connected with its acceptance; and has passed by personal, divine teaching, wholly off that ground, while fully recognising that responsibility, but finding itself lost on that ground, and passes by redemption into a wholly new place, that of the Second man, now risen from the dead, and that livingly, with the Holy Ghost to give it its power.<a name=505:30></a> This is the basis, for He is now glorified also.<a name=505:31></a> This involves our being dead with Him, but it is not in its highest form connected with that or resurrection with that blessed One.<a name=505:32></a> In Ephesians it has no place: we are dead in sins there, and sovereign grace has taken and put us into Christ in heavenly places, as it took Him from death and set Him there.<a name=505:33></a> Preliminary experience of death and resurrection with Christ is not directly connected with this; to occupy it, I do not doubt, we must go through it, but this is the discovery of no strength; the manner of it is made perfect in weakness.<a name=505:34></a> And everything, on to the new heavens and new earth, is based on that, and the blessed putting away of sin out of God's sight, when He shall have His rest.<a name=505:35></a>

		I have no wish, dear brother, to weaken your testimony to our being in a risen and glorified Christ; I believe it every way needed.<a name=505:36></a> But the first testimony of all is to live there.<a name=505:37></a> Though all Christ said was Himself, yet His life was the faithful and true witness.<a name=505:38></a> I am quite ready to believe you do so more than myself.<a name=505:39></a> But still His words must be the spring of our thoughts; we must live by them.<a name=505:40></a> Our responsibility now is to shew out Christ, who is in us, though His presence is associated with love in us according to the love wherewith He, the blessed One, was loved.<a name=505:41></a> God will teach you, only we must receive, and what we get from the word must still be given us .<a name=505:42></a>.<a name=505:43></a>.<a name=505:44></a> .<a name=505:45></a> The Lord be with you .<a name=505:46></a>.<a name=505:47></a>.<a name=505:48></a> .<a name=505:49></a> Here, with a weary head, I have written a long letter, when, in starting, I scarcely thought to say a word.<a name=505:50></a> I have no doubt the gracious Lord will lead you into all the truth.<a name=505:51></a>
