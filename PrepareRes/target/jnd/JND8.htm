		A book which professes to examine another is sufficiently definite in its object not to need much preface.<a name=1:2></a> I shall add, therefore, but few words.<a name=1:3></a> My judgment distinctly is, that the whole system maintained in the "Thoughts" is untenable and worthless as a system.<a name=1:4></a> I do not expect to persuade everybody of this, nor that everybody will be sufficiently willing to be persuaded to read the examination.<a name=1:5></a> But such is the testimony I fed bound to give about it.<a name=1:6></a>

		<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not as yet make any general remarks as to the system contained in the book here examined.<a name=3:11></a> It is a very elaborate one, and extends to many points.<a name=3:12></a> It is not stated connectedly in the book itself, though every occasion is seized to make good all that appears to sustain it, and undermine all that may have been advanced by any one elsewhere that might overthrow it.<a name=3:13></a> But I have felt that the best thing to do was, not to give my judgment on the system, but first to examine the statements here made, which are used to support it, and to enquire how far they are borne out by Scripture consistently with it, or with each other.<a name=3:14></a> Various circumstances, and above all my own occupations, induce me to do it in parts, of which this first will be proportionably by far the longest, on account of the many important general topics which the introductory chapters suggested.<a name=3:15></a> It will be really an "Examination of the Thoughts," etc.<a name=3:16></a>, etc.<a name=3:17></a> It will be seen that, even when there are contradictions which I have shewn to exist, I have done no more than state them; I have not reasoned as a controversialist thereupon; I leave that to the reader.<a name=3:18></a> He will judge the contradiction itself, and its bearing on a system maintained with so much condemnation of everything else.<a name=3:19></a> I do not expect that partisans of that system will be content with my statements, or convinced by them: but I do believe that many unprejudiced brethren will be enabled to judge a great many of the assertions made, which they have not the leisure to examine (perhaps not the habit of examining), as they are examined here.<a name=3:20></a> In the long run, under the Lord's mercy, the sentiments of such persons have their weight, and it is such that it is really of value to convince, and to whom investigation is due.<a name=3:21></a> Their minds, at any rate, arrested by what maybe said, will be free to examine the whole for themselves.<a name=3:22></a>

		<h3>EXAMINATION</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"The Revelation treats mainly of the present dispensation.<a name=4:1></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The subjects involved in this book are quite as serious as those of which it directly treats: the true meaning of the heavenly calling; the earthly, or unearthly character of the church s position and associations; the true character and form of evil, against which we have to be on our guard; but above all, what the portion and calling of the church is.<a name=4:2></a> These are questions that give importance to its statements, and demand that their accuracy should be examined, and their proofs enquired into.<a name=4:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The title of this chapter is of importance.<a name=4:4></a> No explanation is given in the chapter itself of what is meant by the present dispensation; but from the previous chapter it seems very evident that it means the church, or, as there expressed, the church dispensation, or Christianity.<a name=4:5></a> (See page 8.<a name=4:6></a>) The statement in page 13, is merely the writer's view of what characterises the dispensation, the justice of which is exactly the point in question.<a name=4:7></a><a href="#4:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> This statement will come before us in its place.<a name=4:8></a> For the present I enquire merely what "the present dispensation" means: and, I repeat, it seems clear from the preceding chapter that it is "the church dispensation.<a name=4:9></a>" The other expressions employed are, "the dispensation to which the New Testament belongs" -- a very ambiguous expression, but one which is meant, I apprehend, to convey a good deal more to the reader than he is aware of at the time he adopts it, and to involve him in most important conclusions before he is aware of what they are.<a name=4:10></a> The third expression is "the present period.<a name=4:11></a>" These, taken together, clearly designate the present church dispensation, of which we form part as Christians.<a name=4:12></a> I am thus particular, because, with the very great
	</div>
	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#4:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>By means of the vague expression "the present dispensation," and calling it "the church dispensation," in the previous chapter, and giving it the limits and character which are found in page 13, the church, and the kingdom, and the period of government itself, closed by Christ's coming to earth, are identified without any argument, and the reader is involved in the conclusion before it is stated. Hence the need of unravelling these points. This is really the whole point in question: whether the scripture does identify these things. But here they are identified by expressions adapted to the popular state of thought, and the mind shut up in the conclusion, before it is aware of what it is. I believe this identification of the church and the kingdom to be of the very worst moral effect to the saint.

		pretensions to accuracy which this book sets up, it behoves us to know of what we are treating, especially as at bottom much turns on the question contained in this chapter, which the writer has thus very naturally put as a sort of frontispiece to the whole book.<a name=5:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It may be remarked that the writer defines very distinctly his idea of the limits and character of the two dispensations which he has in his mind;<a href="#5:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> "that in which Christ is seated at the right hand of God, secretly exercising the power of God's throne"; and, "that in which He will come forth in the exercise of the power of His own peculiar kingdom.<a name=5:2></a>" The first of these two is to him identical with "the church dispensation.<a name=5:3></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I must beg the reader's pardon, if I often take notice of statements which appear to me inaccurate, even when they are not very important, because in the questions to which these statements have given rise accuracy of statement and the maintenance of the integrity of scripture are much relied on -- we shall see, as we proceed, whether on good ground.<a name=5:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are told that when the Lord Jesus returned to the Father, "Jehovah said unto him, Sit thou at my right hand, until I shall have set thy foes a footstool for thy feet.<a name=5:5></a>" Here we have the ordinary translation changed, without, as it seems
	</div>
	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#5:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>We have here, again, an absolute abstract statement which may be true, or may be false; but which, if once admitted, decides by the statement itself the whole question, without anyone's being aware of it. It supposes that the whole period in question is divided into two parts -- the time during which Christ is seated at the right hand of God; and the time during which He will come forth in the exercise of the power of His own peculiar kingdom. Now, suppose there was an interval between these two. Supposing I were to speak of the time Napoleon was on the throne, and the time he was a prisoner at St. Helena, as all his history from the time he became emperor. All the time at Elba and all the hundred days would be left out. Now the statement made by the writer here supposes the whole period to be exclusively taken up by His being on the Father's throne or in the exercise of the power of His own peculiar kingdom. I repeat, it supposes it assumes that. Now that is exactly the point in question which has to be proved. If Christ rises up from His Father's throne and comes and receives the church to Himself, before He enters on the exercise of the power of His own peculiar kingdom -- then this statement is false as pretending to embrace the whole matter in this division of the period into these two parts. This is a very common sophism -- to involve the conclusion of the matter in question in the statement, before any proof is given.

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Still it is pretty clear that one object is to make it appear that Jehovah is acting meanwhile for Christ, and it is expressly stated that the fact is so ("it speaks of the power of the throne as acting in His behalf").<a name=6:2></a> And when this is coupled with the fact, admitted on all hands, that Revelation up to chapter 19, does represent God acting for Christ before His appearing; and that <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#110">Psalm  110</a>is stated to be characteristic of this dispensation, and the Revelation is declared to treat mainly of this dispensation -- I say, putting all these statements together, it is clear that the changed version is given with a view of presenting God in it as so acting for Christ during this dispensation, and characteristically of it.<a name=6:3></a> But then, so important an interpretation
	</div>
	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#6:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>I have spoken thus moderately in the text, because it seems to me, that changing the translation without notice and without reasons given, and then building a great deal upon it, is itself a very objectionable proceeding. But I add here, that it seems to me that the translation given is a wrong one. I am not a good Hebraist -- far from it; but, as far as I have been able to examine the books and statements of those who are, I judge the Hebrew will not bear this. The English reader should be aware that there is no such tense in Hebrew as "shall have" It is an interpretation which must rest on the word translated "until;" having the force, as it has sometimes, of "while." But this supposes the verb used to have the force of some continuous action, until the termination of which the "while" lasts. Thus, "sit until I shall have prepared" means "while I am preparing." Hence the author has given the sense of "forming" and "preparing" to what is done with the footstool. But, I think I may say that the word translated "make" has no such meaning, and has not a continuous force. It signifies the act of setting something actually, or morally, in a certain position; and if so, the Hebrew would not even bear the sense attributed. Moreover, I think that when it is so used, it is habitually (I am disposed to believe, from all the passages I have been able to find and examine for myself, always) the perfect, and not the (present or) future that is used; sometimes, perhaps, the participle. I do not allude to negative phrases. Moreover, no translation, English or other, with which I am acquainted, so translates, or supposes such a translation of it -- neither Horsley, nor the Lyra Davidis, nor the new interlinear translation, nor the German, nor French, nor Gesenius; but on the contrary exclude it. In conclusion, I do not think the Hebrew could be justly translated so; at all events, I have no doubt it is a wrong translation. And, as every translation, critical or other, with which most of us are familiar, translates it as the English, it is surely an unwarrantable thing to impose a new one, and build up a system on it, without any reason given; and silently convert "make" into "preparing" or "forming," a sense which the Hebrew word, I think I may safely venture to say, will not possibly bear. The reader conversant with such things will find Gesenius (under the Hebrew word gad, 2) using the passage in the sense of present spiritual subjection, as those ignorant of the millennium do, a long column of reasoning connected with the assertion of its being the "term assigned to a period," and not the "period during which." The truth is, it rests in the nature of the act. "Have," "shall have," or "do" are immaterial if the act be one act which closes the period. "You shall stay in prison till you 'have,' or 'shall have,' paid, or 'till' you pay," is all the same thing in English. On the other hand, "you shall stay in the house 'till your wounds are healed,' or 'shall be healed,' or 'whilst they are healing,'" would be substantially the same thing; because the "till" here is the close of a continuous act, with whose close the period closes. Now I appeal to any one cognisant of Hebrew if *sheeth* has this force.<p>At any rate, giving a changed translation, contrary to everyone commonly known, and building a vast system upon it, without the least proof that it is correct, is itself sufficient to render the whole suspected.

		of the psalm ought to have been plainly stated and proved.<a name=7:1></a> That is, that what verse I of that psalm means is, that God was acting for Christ, in setting His foes to be His footstool during this dispensation, and that such acting was characteristic of this dispensation.<a name=7:2></a> This is what the statements amount to: for it is stated that this verse speaks of the power of the throne acting on Christ's behalf, and that it is characteristic of this dispensation.<a name=7:3></a> Now the only acting in the verse is setting foes for a footstool.<a name=7:4></a> Hence, the setting of foes for Christ's footstool by God the Father is what characterises all this dispensation; <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#110">Psalm  110</a>is the acting of God all through to this effect, not His sovereign word and power putting them at a given time under Christ's feet for Him to subdue; and the Revelation treats mainly of this dispensation, because it speaks of God's so acting.<a name=7:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I apprehend, if it had been fairly and plainly stated that this verse describes God's actually putting down the foes of Christ all through this dispensation, the church dispensation, such an interpretation would at once have been rejected by every intelligent Christian, who knows well that the foes of Christ only rise up more and more to a head of rebellion until God gives them up, when patience can no longer have any hope, to be trampled upon by Christ.<a name=7:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And this becomes the more important because, according to the author, instead of seeing Christ the royal man, exalted and hid there until a certain period, it is Christ Himself, as God,

		that thus exercises power -- "the power of the throne of God which He exercises.<a name=8:1></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And it is stated (page 15) that the book of Revelation "especially refers to the period during which Christ is hidden with God": and these things are spoken of as His <i>present</i> relation to, and as we have seen, exercise of power upon the nations, hidden in the throne.<a name=8:2></a> And yet we are told with strange inconsistency that, while (page 37) "our dispensation is still, as it then was, under the throne as it was then seen by John," yet (page 37) "the sixth chapter and all that follows [that is, all that is stated of God's actings in it] are <i>altogether future, even at this present hour</i>.<a name=8:3></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So that while we are introduced to the Revelation as treating mainly of the present dispensation, of a period during which Christ is sitting in God's throne according to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#110">Psalm  110</a>, His present relation to the nations, not one word of the actings which are spoken of have taken place during the eighteen hundred years of the present dispensation.<a name=8:4></a> The Revelation treats of no part of the present dispensation which is yet fulfilled, though the things spoken of be distinctively characteristic of it; and that which thus distinctively characterises it is altogether future.<a name=8:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But after all, the truth is, the psalm does not speak of God's actings during this period, but of Christ's position, until God does set His foes to be His footstool; and this, though in very strange language -- language which just betrays the intellectual road travelled -- is admitted by Mr.<a name=8:6></a> N.<a name=8:7></a> himself.<a name=8:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Pages 12, 13: "The footstool has not yet been formed" -- consequently not set under Christ's feet, <i>which is the only acting of the throne spoken of in the psalm</i>; and the Revelation "treats of events which <i>precede</i> the mission of Christ, and the <i>setting of the footstool</i>.<a name=8:9></a>" "It leads on" to that: that "forms the conclusion, not the subject, of the book.<a name=8:10></a>" How then, since this is the only act of God spoken of in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#110">Psalm  110</a>, can <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#110">Psalm  110</a>be so distinctly characteristic of the dispensation of which the Revelation mainly treats?<a name=8:11></a> There is no characteristic of the <i>present period</i> so especially distinctive as this acting of Jehovah's throne spoken of in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#110">Psalm  110</a>, and yet the Revelation, which treats of the present dispensation, of the <i>present period</i>, treats of events which precede this acting, which is not the subject of the book!<a name=8:12></a> For this <i>setting</i> of the footstool is the only acting of the throne spoken of in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#110">Psalm  110</a>.<a name=8:13></a> The

		simple fact is, it was settled that the Revelation should apply to the present dispensation.<a name=9:1></a> It was settled that any statements declaring its applying to the government of the earth merely should not affect its application to "the church dispensation"; and therefore <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#110">Psalm  110</a>is treated as God's actings on the throne while Christ was sitting there, and thus the Revelation and the psalm are brought in together, and the contradictions which affect the whole substance of the statements are left to be found out by those that have the patience to investigate the soundness of what is stated.<a name=9:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another and yet more important object in this translation which is not avowed neither.<a name=9:3></a> Christ's sitting till God shall have made His foes His footstool involves the church's remaining here till Antichrist be set to be the footstool of Christ's feet.<a name=9:4></a> If Christ's foes are to be made the footstool of Christ before He leaves the throne, and that He leaves God's throne before He receives up the church, it is clear that the church is not received up till His foes are made His footstool, and this by God's actings -- of course, effectual actings.<a name=9:5></a> This goes too far, indeed, for it would suppose Antichrist, for example, made by the actings of God's power the footstool of Christ before His rising up from the throne to receive the church.<a name=9:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This may go to prove the unsoundness of the whole system.<a name=9:7></a> But I only ask, Is it legitimate, in reasoning on Scripture, to give a translation which silently involves the whole principle which is attempted to be taught, without giving the least proof that the new translation is correct?<a name=9:8></a> I do not agree with the sense given to "setting.<a name=9:9></a>" The contradictions in which it involves the writer have been shewn; but I take it on his own ground now.<a name=9:10></a>

		This verse is quoted so often, "because so distinctively characteristic of the dispensation to which the New Testament belongs.<a name=11:8></a>" I have two remarks to make on this.<a name=11:9></a> First, what is the meaning of the "New Testament belongs"?<a name=11:10></a> If merely that it has been given to this dispensation, to the church, that is clear.<a name=11:11></a> They had it not before.<a name=11:12></a> But, if it be meant to involve (silently, yet again), that all in the New Testament applies to this dispensation, then it is positively false.<a name=11:13></a> Witness the title of the chapter we are writing on.<a name=11:14></a> "The Revelation treats mainly of the present dispensation.<a name=11:15></a>" The New Testament does not then (save as given to the saints, and all things are theirs) belong entirely to this dispensation.<a name=11:16></a> "Mainly," no doubt, it does.<a name=11:17></a>" The writer may -- put <i>his</i> limits, others <i>theirs</i>; but he cannot assert it qualifiedly in the title to the chapter, and unqualifiedly in the body of it, and expect the assertion to be received of any reasonable man.<a name=11:18></a> I should put another most decided limitation to it.<a name=11:19></a> Christ died for the nation, as well as to gather the church.<a name=11:20></a> This, being God's counsel, followed up by Christ's act, I apprehend is (might not I say, must be?<a name=11:21></a>) the subject of the Spirit's testimony.<a name=11:22></a> This testimony does not belong properly to the church dispensation, even when synchronic in its presentation.<a name=11:23></a> Besides, there is the testimony which preceded

		We have seen that it is not Jehovah's throne acting for Christ, but Christ sitting on it till He does.<a name=13:2></a> Were it otherwise, surely a difference in the manner of governing the world is not what distinguishes to a saint this dispensation.<a name=13:3></a> This is so clearly the writer's mind, that it is only as a consequence which we might naturally expect that, during this period, Christ's relation to the church, as a kingdom He immediately governs, is brought in; and after all, only in relation to the churches, not to the church.<a name=13:4></a> A very serious consequence is connected with this, that Christianity, or the church dispensation, is treated as an age, and the new age as beginning when it ends.<a name=13:5></a> "As soon as this verse ceases to apply, i.<a name=13:6></a>e.<a name=13:7></a>, whenever the Lord Jesus quits His present place on the throne of God, our dispensation ends, and the new age begins.<a name=13:8></a>" (Page 11.<a name=13:9></a>)

		The other part of the statement is an assertion, without any attempt at proof; namely, when Christ quits God's throne, the new age begins.<a name=13:12></a> An assertion moreover which is clearly not true, because the new age cannot begin while Antichrist is here in power -- in a word, until he is judged.<a name=13:13></a> Now, however short the interval may be, this shews that it is not Christ's quitting God's throne which begins the new age.<a name=13:14></a> The end of the age is not an instant; it applies moreover <i>to the world</i> here below.<a name=13:15></a> And, further, the saints of Christendom are gathered up in the harvest, at <i>the end</i> of the age, by the Son of man's sending forth His angels.<a name=13:16></a> So thus <i>our</i> dispensation is ended before ever the new age begins, or that He has quitted the throne; or He has quitted it, and the harvest goes on, which harvest is the end of that age, which consequently has not closed by His quitting it.<a name=13:17></a> The length of the interval is not here the question; but the fact of His quitting the throne toes not close the age, called our dispensation, and begin the

The putting of the two statements of scripture together, indeed (namely, that Christ *comes to receive His saints*; and, that the harvest in which the wheat is gathered in is at the end of the age), demonstrates that Christ's leaving the Father's throne and receiving the saints precedes the close of the age. It is not finished when He comes to receive the church. The only other way of taking this is, to say that the harvest applies to earthly saints, and not to the church. But that would only make the case stronger still, namely, that even the earthly judgments are before the end of the age, and would put the receiving of the saints as quite a separate thing, clean out of the question of the age. In any case the system of the author is demonstrated to be altogether untrue.

And this is all that is material to observe; because it proves that, supposing the blindness to remain on the mass till Christ executes judgment (which, I suppose, nobody denies), this does not hinder an effectual work, not wrought by the church amongst that people (beloved of God, though enemies in respect of the gospel) of which the Revelation treats, as indeed of no other work amongst them.

		First, I recall the remark that the new translation is unproved, and, as it seems to me, unwarranted.<a name=19:9></a> If it were so, it would alter the whole meaning of the passage in the most important way; because God would have subjugated all Christ's foes, in order that they should be His footstool.<a name=19:10></a> If God were making them such by the actings of the power of His throne, they would be subdued by the actings of power, before Christ began to act at all.<a name=19:11></a> The whole judicial reign of Christ, and the millennial scheme would be false.<a name=19:12></a> But making His enemies His footstool is merely by the authority of His power giving them up to be trampled upon by Him.<a name=19:13></a> Next, it is connected with the rejection of Messiah on earth, whereon Jehovah calls Him up to sit at the right hand of power, until His enemies should be given up to Him.<a name=19:14></a> The chief enemies actually in view in the psalm are His enemies, amongst whom He will rule down here -- "rule thou in the midst of thine enemies" -- earthly enemies, when the rod of His power will be sent out of Zion.<a name=19:15></a> This is all that is actually spoken of in this psalm.<a name=19:16></a>

		But, as in the analogous <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8">Psalm  8</a>, where though the subjection of earthly creatures is mentioned, yet from a general (there a universal) term, the apostle applies it to everything but God the Father; so here, I apprehend, anything that takes the place of adversary or enemy will be given into His hand.<a name=19:17></a> Thus, in a passage which I do not doubt to be an allusion to this, the apostle makes it universal: "He [Christ] must reign, till he hath put all his enemies under his feet": and thus

		If it be alleged that all this happens before He leaves His throne, then the whole reasoning and system of the author fails; because the church would be taken away before He left the throne and before Christ came to receive it.<a name=20:10></a> Yet it is to meet Him in the air; and, if this be not inconsistent with His sitting on His throne at that time, it is quite clear that the reasoning from the psalm comes to nothing; because its force lies in this, that He is on that throne till His enemies are put under Him, and consequently the church is here, and our dispensation continues: whereas in the other case, the church would be gone before what the writer calls the end of our dispensation on His rising up.<a name=20:11></a> If He has risen up before He receives the church, there is some interval passed over in the psalm: so that the argument as to the instantaneous closing is false in that case also.<a name=20:12></a> In either case the using it as a proof of exact synchronism is good for nothing.<a name=20:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us come to some particulars, and we shall see the entire confusion of the statements in detail.<a name=22:16></a> The Revelation treats, we are told, of the period during which Christ is hidden with God.<a name=22:17></a> Hence His relation to the church would be marked.<a name=22:18></a> Its chief subject is the relation of the throne of God to the nations, but it has another object in relation to the churches; it reveals the present relation of Christ to them, but the Gentiles supreme and glorious, and the church suffering.<a name=22:19></a> This characterises our dispensation, and the period of which the Revelation treats.<a name=22:20></a>

	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#25:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>There is a very deeply and fundamentally false principle running through all the author's reasonings on this point. I mean this, that, if life be there, inasmuch as it is always of God, or divine life, it is always essentially the same, whatever official distinctions there may be as to dispensation. Now, as to the possession of life by man, it must be holy in the principle of its nature, obedient, and have God for its object. So far, it must be fundamentally the same. But this makes man the end and essential object of all this. Then these things, man having life, may be termed "official" destinations (though, even so, it is most sad to say that those things by which God acts peculiarly on His saints are mere official differences). I do not think a spiritual holy mind that loves Christ can help being shocked at being told that that possession of the Comforter, which made it expedient that Christ should go away -- which guides him into all truth -- gives him communion with the Father and the Son -- which is an unction by which he knows all things, the things freely given to him of God, yea, the deep things of God -- which enables him to cry, Abba, Father -- by which the love of God is shed abroad in his heart, and by which he knows that he is one with Christ, in Him, and He in him -- that all this is a mere official distinction. <p>But the truth is, this principle shuts God out of the matter, in making the difference as to man the end. These differences of dispensation are the displays of God's glory; and therefore of all importance, and most essential, because a positive part of His glory. The law maintained His majesty, and title to claim obedience, as the gospel displayed His grace, and gave the obedience of a child. To say that the breaking down the middle wall of partition, and the accomplishment of the glorious work by which it was effected produced only an official difference, because man had life, and man was forgiven, or forborne with in view of it, is to say that the display of God's glory was an unessential thing: the display of all His glorious wisdom, power, and love, in that mighty work which stands alone in heaven and earth, the object of angels research. Was it unessential to them, who found scarce even an official difference, though doubtless it affected their position, to see Him who had created them, nailed to the tree in that mighty and solitary hour which stands aloof from all before and after? Let us only remember that dispensations are the necessary displays of God's glory, and we shall soon feel where we are brought by what makes mere official difference out of them. <p>Besides, the difference is very great indeed as to man. It is everything as to his present affections, as to his life. Because God puts forth power, power too which works in man through faith, according to the display He makes of Himself. And therefore the whole life, in its working, in its recognition of God, is formed on this dispensational display. And this is the field of responsibility too. Thus, if God reveals Himself to Abraham as Almighty, Abraham is to live and walk in the power of that name. And so of the promises given to him. Israel is to dwell in the land as the redeemed people of the Lord -- their affections, ways, responsibility, and happiness flowing from what God was to them as having placed them there. So to us -- the presence of the Holy Ghost Himself being the great distinguishing fact, with the knowledge He affords. Because all this is what faith ought to act upon, and the life which we live in the flesh we live by faith, for the just shall live by faith. Hence the Lord does not hesitate to say, This is life eternal, to know Thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent. That could not have been the life of those before. Had they then not life? Nay, but it could not be stated in that way -- their life was not that; and to undo these differences is to make a life without affections, character, responsibility, in a word, without faith. You cannot do it; for to us to believe is to live. The more you succeed in levelling them to one thing, the more you succeed in stifling divine affections, and active human responsibility (destroying, as far as may be, divine communion, and frustrating divine grace), the more the glory and energy of faith is null, and hence God's glory in us. <p>There is another point connected with this, that I would not leave untouched: -- namely, that making a difference of position in glory is setting aside the value of Christ's blood, and making our place on high depend on something else. Now I meet this difficulty in the face. And I say there is a difference in glory; and that difference does not depend on the precious blood of Christ; and that to say that it does, takes away its value from that blood. Difference there is. The Saviour recognises the setting on His right hand and on His left; and many other passages prove it. Now, if this depend on the blood of Christ, this would attribute a various value to it, making it uncertain and imperfect in the extent of its efficacy. The blood of the Lamb gives to all their sole title to be in the glory, and gives to all an equal and perfect justification from sin; and therefore in its effect, there can be no difference. To suppose a difference is to call in question the completeness of its efficacy. But there is a difference. <p>And this (while the title to be in the glory is for all in the blood) depends therefore on something else. It is, in the accomplishment of the counsels of God the Father, given to those for whom it is prepared; and given (though man is not in the least the judge of that labour, and there are first that shall be last, and last first) according to the working and energy of the Spirit of God, and faithfulness through grace in service. God does what He will with His own. Still we know that in doing so He displays what He is, and is consistent with Himself; and position and reward answer to the sovereignty of God, which has given us a position, and the operation of the Spirit by which we have walked in it. It is the sovereignty of God we know from the Lord's answer to the sons of Zebedee, and the parable in @Matthew 20. It is the fruit of labour, as we know from @1 Corinthians 3: 8; the parables (@Luke 19 and @Matthew 25); @1 Thessalonians 2: 19, 20; @2 John 8. I suppose it will not be questioned that this work is through the efficacious operation of the Spirit of God. Suppose, now, the Lord chose to put the Old Testament saints in the position of the four living creatures, and the New Testament saints in that of the crowned elders, both of whom are said to sing the song of the redeemed together; what is there contrary to principle in this? I am not here at all affirming it is so; but enquiring whether there is anything *a priori* to condemn it. I see nothing at all It is quite clear that the saints on earth during the millennium are redeemed by blood, and yet as to glory much farther off than the crowned elders. Why in this administration of glory may there not be intermediate positions?

It is not an introduction into some old thing (this is treated of in @Romans 11; the church condition being finished, chapter 8, and the Jews taken up); it is to make of twain one new man.<p>I take the opportunity here of remarking, what might have been introduced earlier, that the writer much insists on Christ being the new thing in the earth while alive down here. That it was a new thing to have a man without sin in His nature is true, and equally so for the blessed God to be manifest in the flesh. But, as regards us, He was still taking His place with the old thing, made of a woman, made under the law, made like to His brethren in all things; @Hebrews 2. As far as man's connection with it went, it was His coming into the midst of the old thing, and not associating man with Him as the head of the new. I suppose that the author refers to the expression in Jeremiah, "For the Lord shall create a new thing in the earth, a woman shall compass a man." But supposing this applied to Christ's birth, Christ would not be the new thing, but His birth of a virgin, which was a new thing. It was the woman's compassing a man which was the new thing created in the earth, not what Christ was; to which the words could not apply. But further, I have never seen the least satisfactory proof that the words apply even to the miraculous birth of Christ: and I doubt if compassing a man has any such a sense, or could have it. At any rate, He is not the new thing here spoken of. Nor is Christ incarnate ever called the new thing. Nor is Christ ever said to be the new creature. I doubt much that it is scriptural, either as an expression, or an idea. Upon this expression of "the new thing" a vast edifice of doctrine is built by the author. He should first shew some scripture for it.

		Now I would humbly suggest, notwithstanding the assertion of the author, that while the Revelation says nothing directly about it -- I urge that it is a very bold thing to say without any proof, that one of its objects is to shew that Israel will not -- yet, that other scriptures clearly shew that there is a remnant turned to God, really converted, before the Lord comes, though those that are left have not received deliverance and salvation.<a name=47:5></a> The Lord Jesus expressly says, "Ye shall not see me henceforth, <i>until</i> ye say, Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord.<a name=47:6></a>" Here we have a positive assertion of the Lord Jesus, that they will not see Him till they say, Blessed -- till their heart be converted to receive Him.<a name=47:7></a> Again, Let any one read <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#56">Isaiah  56</a>, where Jewish blessings are promised, and yet it is only said "my salvation is near to come.<a name=47:8></a>" Will it be said that persons of whom God says, that they choose the things that please Him, take hold of His covenant, that join themselves to the Lord to serve Him, and to love the name of the Lord, to be His servants -- that God in this describes unconverted people?<a name=47:9></a> Again, <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#65">Isaiah  65</a>,66, where a remnant is distinguished by the Lord as His servants.<a name=47:10></a> See chapter 65:8-15, and 66:5,14, where there is a remnant very expressly distinguished even from others that are spared.<a name=47:11></a> And here I would remark in passing (what seems to me the key to all Isaiah) from chapter 40 to the end: it is this word <i>servant</i>.<a name=47:12></a> Israel was Jehovah's servant to be His witness.<a name=47:13></a> But Israel as in chapter 49 rejecting Jesus, He is the servant; and then the remnant at the close, who hear the Servant's voice, are themselves recognised as the servants to be blessed with Him in His earthly glory.<a name=47:14></a> They are thus described in chapter 51, and their progressive condition spoken of (chapter 51 to chapter 53:12).<a name=47:15></a> Then the atoning work of the true Servant is brought out.<a name=47:16></a> Again, not to mention a multitude of other Psalms, see <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#80">Psalm  80</a>, where Israel, God with Israel, and Israel's blessings are spoken of.<a name=47:17></a> Yet here it is prayed that the hand of Jehovah may be upon the man of His right hand, upon the Son of man, whom He made so strong for Himself.<a name=47:18></a> And, to go no farther, supposing the testimony of "the Son of God rejected" --

		It seems to me, indeed, a most solemn thing to say that the Spirit of God in the Psalms should become habitually the instrument, not of prophetically revealing the wickedness of the wicked, but of expressing the false piety (for, if unconverted, their piety is false) of unconverted men, and that in the most touching strains of appeal to God,<a href="#48:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> some of which rise up to prophecies of Christ Himself, and are all inspired by His Spirit.<a name=48:6></a> It is in vain to say they are Christians.<a name=48:7></a> Their hopes and prospects, their prayers and praises, and the answer of God's Spirit to them, are all Jewish.<a name=48:8></a> And yet if this be not the former, the whole system of the author must fall down together (and that is the worst of making systems).<a name=48:9></a> See the promise even at the end of that famous <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#69">Psalm  69</a>.<a name=48:10></a> Take again <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#73">Psalm  73</a>; so <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#65">Psalm  65</a>and 66: I take the first that present themselves.<a name=48:11></a> Are the promises in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#31">Psalm  31</a>and <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#35">Psalm  35</a>not to be accomplished in respect of those whose confidence is expressed in so many other passages?<a name=48:12></a> And these shew the connection of their hopes with Christ.<a name=48:13></a> And note here the quotation by Peter, and even the prophecy as to Christ, verse 20.<a name=48:14></a> But it would be endless to quote them all.<a name=48:15></a> The reader may make this remark, that while often insisting on integrity of heart,

		The introductory part of this chapter I offer no remark upon because, though I do not acquiesce in parts of it, I am not aware of any principle involved which is not elsewhere remarked on.<a name=54:17></a> In page 40 we have another example of how little anything critical or exegetical can be trusted to in these "Thoughts.<a name=54:18></a>" "He saw 'a throne set in heaven.<a name=54:19></a>' Being 'set,' or firmly established, it stood in contrast with the mutability and failure of everything he had known below.<a name=54:20></a>" Now it is perfectly clear to anyone who can consult the Greek that there is no semblance of any such idea.<a name=54:21></a> It is literally, "a throne lay there"; but in English perhaps best rendered by "there was a throne there.<a name=54:22></a>" "Set" there (in the familiar sense of setting, i.<a name=54:23></a>e.<a name=54:24></a>, placing a chair)

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The meaning of this difference is this: stability of the throne refers to the whole period in which man failed down here; whereas finding a throne placed, or set there, shews rather the assumption of a particular position or relationship by God.<a name=55:2></a> And this is perfectly answerable to the statement made to John by the voice, "Come up hither, and I will shew thee what must happen after these things.<a name=55:3></a>" Now God may be ever in a general sense on a throne (though He is not considered always in this light, nor is it the highest thought of God -- that is rather the dwelling in the light inaccessible); still He is the blessed and only Potentate.<a name=55:4></a> The throne, however, of government is a special relationship, to be known as it is revealed.<a name=55:5></a> Thus in Job we see Satan going among the sons of God before it.<a name=55:6></a> Here the throne is revealed in relation to things which are to happen after what has been stated as to Christ's relationship to the churches on earth.<a name=55:7></a> For it is well to remember that which is stated of one general common period is contradicted by the express word of God in the Revelation.<a name=55:8></a> John, after the vision of the churches, is caught up to see the things which should happen thereafter, and then sees the throne<a href="#55:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> which was set or was then in heaven.<a name=55:9></a> <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#4:2">Revelation  4:2</a>.<a name=55:10></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#55:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>I suppose there can be little doubt that the allusion here is to @Daniel 7: 9, where the thrones are set; which, being expressed by a word used for "thrown into a place," has been translated "cast down" in the English translation, but by the Septuagint "set" which, I suppose, is clearly the sense, as received by Gesenius and other learned men, and many interpreters, and agrees with the context. If so, the Greek here is natural enough, and would give much critical force to the observations here. But this I leave to the learned. There is no need of reference to the Hebrew word; as the Greek word is regularly used in the sense in which it is found here: as @John 19: 29, "There was set a vessel full of vinegar." Reference to a dictionary will give the use and examples; @John 2: 6, @Matthew 5: 14, may suffice, particularly the former.

		It is a remark, I think, of Lord Bacon's that if one were to tell a falsehood to one's self often enough, we should believe it at the year's end: how much more when error comes from those we are accustomed to respect, and falls in with our natural wishes and feelings.<a name=65:6></a> "The throne, surrounded by the symbolic glories we have been considering, is intended, through all the deep darkness and sorrow of the present dispensation, to stand before us a sure sustaining object of faith.<a name=65:7></a>" Abstractedly, no doubt, the throne of God does so, though much more to us a Father's love.<a name=65:8></a><a href="#65:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> But this does not hinder its being true that the revelations here made are, according to the author, all entirely future.<a name=65:9></a> The throne here displayed has never acted at all up to this time.<a name=65:10></a> And, according to the word, all the events were subsequent to what is stated as to the churches, which are Christ's relationship to the excellent body, the church, according to the author.<a name=65:11></a> It is future glory too, according to him, that is revealed: so that it is not the throne as acting now.<a name=65:12></a> Further, while it shewed the church in its high and distinctive future glories, "our future exaltation,"<a href="#65:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a> yet the object also was to give us instruction essential to our testimony and service upon

It presents the church symbolically in glory, and gives Christ the titles which belong to His connection with Israel in a yet unasserted title; and yet it is hence that precise and definite instruction is given to the church for its present testimony and service. This has been in a measure felt by the author, though laboriously sought to be got over: for, after stating that it is not Christ's church title, but a new relationship, he says, "yet it is not difficult to see the reason why He should be here introduced as the Lion of Judah." Having mingled and confused all the relationships of Christ and the throne with the church and Israel, the reasons for that must be given: but the simple scripture does not need these reasons, nor this justification. He who was on earth the Lamb, and was withal the Lion of Judah, was thus identified and recognised in His own Person in the throne on high. Hereafter He will be known as Offspring of David too.

But having generally given the cursive manuscripts in classes, and merely the numbers which agree, no one can form a judgment for himself, unless he assume the system of recension adopted by Mr. T. His judgment may be very good; but the reader is disabled from judging for himself. Another defect, as to *convenience* of reference, is, that the hiatuses in C (which no one can be well expected to carry in his memory) are not stated in the margin; so that the reader cannot judge whether it be silent or adverse. In the present case Tregelles's note is a transcript of Scholz's, which states the authorities against, but nothing more.

But these bowls are never connected in the Old Testament with incense, nor even with what men used to take fire from the altar with to put the incense on. It is employed for the Hebrew word used in @Numbers 7 several times for the silver bowls offered by the princes; @Exodus 38: 3. (LXX chapter 38: 34, Ed. Bos.) Bowls of brass connected with the brazen altar; the same in @Numbers 4: 14. In @Amos 6: 6, when used for a drinking bowl the LXX translation is quite different. In @2 Chronicles 4: 22 (21), the Septuagint seems to give another word; but a little attention will, I think, make it plain. The word *labides* is placed by the Complutensian edition, after *luknoi*. Of this there can be very little doubt, seeing it is the term used for a part of the *luknoi* in the description, @Exodus 37. (LXX 38: 20, or Compl. 24.) There is no word for this in @2 Chronicles 4: 22 in Hebrew; the Septuagint adds it. This being so, *phialai* corresponds with the usual Hebrew word. The general expression of *phialai* is borrowed possibly from Solomon rather than others. But they had no particular connection with the altar of incense. The censers, or vessels used for that, are translated by the LXX as *purcia*, as in @Exodus 38: 3 (35). The same thing is in @Exodus 27: 3 as to both words. They are used to contain the plagues oftener than prayers. See chapters 15-18, chapter 21: 9.

		Lastly, chapters 17 and 18 do not profess to be history or narration at all, but description of a particular object of judgment, whose details had not yet been entered into; only the fact of its judgment had been mentioned in its place in the two previous statements of the course of final events.<a name=85:7></a> <i>Now</i> the details are entered into, of what it was, its relationship with other objects of judgment, and the circumstances of the judgment itself.<a name=85:8></a> Just as I might describe Paris, its circumstances, vanity, objects of art pillaged elsewhere, and its siege, in the history I have supposed.<a name=85:9></a> The same thing occurs after the completion of the history of, and subsequent to, Christ's coming: after the marriage of the Lamb, the coming of the King of kings -- the destruction of the beast -- the binding of Satan -- the millennium -- the loosing of Satan -- the judgment of the dead -- and the close of all things.<a name=85:10></a> In a word, after the series of events given from chapter 19 to the end of chapter 21: 8 inclusive, a description is given of the heavenly Jerusalem, and its relation with the earth (as before of Babylon, and her relation with the beast, and in the same manner).<a name=85:11></a> But all this does not touch the orderly narration, where orderly narration is professed to be given, as it surely is, as description is professed to be given in another part; and to take events out of the descriptive (professedly descriptive) part, in order to compare them with others in the narrative part, to disprove the order of narration, because the chapters of description come after the narrative ones, is simply confusion and nothing else.<a name=85:12></a> Yet it is of this the writer says "I wish it to be especially noticed, that these instances prove that the Revelation is not a consecutive history; and therefore any system of interpretation that regards it as a consecutive history, whether of events yet future, or of events past, must be erroneous.<a name=85:13></a>" And all this

But then it was quite important enough to give it a history apart, as it was of Babylon afterwards; because these evils and judgments at the close, which take place under the seventh trumpet, forming the latter part of the Revelation (beginning with chapter 12), are really the most morally important of the whole book.

		<a class="footnote" name="#92:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>This point is constantly recurring in the author's statements, and is part of an elaborate system, which makes the Aaronic priesthood of Aaron and his family the type of the heavenly priesthood of Christ and the church during the millennium. Where is the proof of this? It is assumed all through this book. I do not discuss it at length here. There is no proof given of it whatever. Now, it is to me more than questionable if it be true. The proper priesthood of Christ is Melchisedec priesthood Now He exercises it for the church after the type of Aaron; but there is no proof that He will do so during the time of millennial glory. It seems to me rather inconsistent, on the contrary, with His position as Melchisedec on earth judging righteously. During the time of Satan's power and our infirmity in conflict we have, if any man sin, an Advocate with the Father. Not to make good our righteousness, but to maintain us in our position before God in our walk. The question is, whether, during the millennium, where there is no temptation, judgment is not the consequence of sin in that day in the earth, instead of intercession, as regards actual present dealings with it: It certainly ought not to be assumed that Christ exercises His priesthood in a Melchisedec manner on His throne, and after an Aaronic pattern in heaven, at the same time, and about the same things.

That Griesbach really gives it as only a questionable reading. Mr. Tregelles (for his name is now known by the publication of his book) adds, in his communication to me, proofs that "us" is the right reading. I dare say his reasonings are just, though the one ancient MS is against the reading; I have no disposition to dispute it. My objection is not to the reading, which is the commonly received one (the change is in *autous*), but to building an immense system on it. But as I had been misled by the reprint of Griesbach's edition, I thought it right to correct it. It is no wonder I was, as these reprints, misled by the Leipsic edition, so give it: indeed Mr. T. says, "I used to think he had rejected it." Having corrected the mistake, which I am enabled to do by the kindness of Mr. T., I do not enter further here into the detail of the critical question. No one can deny that the passage is, as to critical readings, in an entangled and unsatisfactory state.

		means "presence": but as by coming a person ceases to be absent, it is so used.<a name=102:1></a> Thus, as to the coming of Titus, the apostle says, "I found no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother" (i.<a name=102:2></a>e.<a name=102:3></a>, he was absent); then by his coming he was comforted (i.<a name=102:4></a>e.<a name=102:5></a>, by his presence).<a name=102:6></a> As to the words "by my coming to you again," it is a strange passage to quote as not applying to a prolonged presence, as he is referring in the preceding verse to his abiding and continuing.<a name=102:7></a> The truth is, there is nothing in the word to fix continuance or not.<a name=102:8></a> I may present myself and disappear, and it would be my presence or coming.<a name=102:9></a> I may do so, and stay, and it would be my presence or coming.<a name=102:10></a> Now I have not the least doubt whatever that presence or coming is used in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15">1 Corinthians  15</a>in the general abstract way for the occasion and power of the resurrection of the saints; for this only is spoken of, though we know the wicked will be raised.<a name=102:11></a> While Christ is absent, they must remain in their graves: when He comes, when He is present, they that are His will leave them: and this is most certainly not contrasted with another resurrection at all, but with another event -- that is, the giving up the kingdom -- which will most positively happen after all resurrection, even of the wicked, is over.<a name=102:12></a> And this confirms very strongly indeed the general sense of "presence" or "coming," because the contrast is with another thing (which thing quite changes everything from that idea, and puts an end to what it expresses), that is, with giving up the kingdom.<a name=102:13></a>

		In verse 51 the apostle is giving details as to themselves and the dead previous to this act, and does not speak at all of all the dead in Christ, or of the order; but of themselves, of the church, such as he then addressed it -- the general principle or manner of their own resurrection.<a name=102:19></a> "<i>We</i> shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed in a moment .<a name=102:20></a>.<a name=102:21></a>.<a name=102:22></a> for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.<a name=102:23></a>"

		For my own part, then, I have not the smallest doubt that we have (verse 23, 24) the general principle and order -- every man in Christ.<a name=103:3></a> First, Christ the firstfruits; then His presence comes (for He is now absent), and they that are His are to rise, when He is thus present.<a name=103:4></a> Afterwards He is to deliver up the kingdom.<a name=103:5></a> Secondly, we have the manner of the church's resurrection, wherein, from many passages, I have no doubt that the saints of the Old Testament will be found.<a name=103:6></a> I do not cite them, because I suppose no one doubts it.<a name=103:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another very important principle involved here.<a name=103:8></a> "There is no redemption apart from union to the person of the Son of God.<a name=103:9></a>" This sounds well; but while, as a general expression, it might have passed unnoticed as a commonly received truth, that life is in the Son, and of Him we have it, and in Him we have it -- still, taken as the accurate basis of an immense system, it is well to estimate justly its value.<a name=103:10></a> There is no such thing spoken of in Scripture, that I am aware of, as union with the Son of God.<a name=103:11></a> He is our life: and we are said to dwell in Him, and He in us; which is known to us by the Holy Ghost.<a name=103:12></a>

		The very word "despise," taken with what follows, has a very equivocal force, though it would not have struck me perhaps else.<a name=106:13></a> It is not reject, or refuse to admit, but "despise," as something which might be worth our having.<a name=106:14></a> And as we read on, the full force of this little word becomes evident, falling in with the earthly character to which Christianity is really reduced always in this book.<a name=106:15></a> We are not called upon to own Israel's ancient promises as belonging to Israel, but to blend them into harmony with the new hopes ministered by Jesus and His apostles.<a name=106:16></a> These ancient promises to Israel being forgotten, the consequence was that Gentiles Christianity became useless for God's purposes of practical testimony on the earth.<a name=106:17></a> And, in fact, before the apostles died, they were boasting themselves against the natural branches of the very tree to which they owed all their own fatness -- such is the author's view.<a name=106:18></a>

		God makes everything work together for good to those who love Him.<a name=106:19></a> It was the attempt to lower our Christian privileges to an earthly measure (so constantly and assiduously made in the system of which this book is the fullest expression, and from which the Spirit of God made one instinctively recoil)

He recognised all the rest; but he stood, called independently into an independent place, for a special and distinct service, and peculiar and distinctive sufferings. None other speaks the least like him in his relationship to the saints and churches; while, there is no doubt, he preached the same gospel of salvation. None were the head of a system entrusted to them in the same manner.

The denying the future hopes of Israel, and so blending the earth and heaven in a new popish metropolitan, is quite a different thing from distinguishing the nature of these hopes, and so not blending them. The author has assumed, that not to blend the church's hopes and Israel's, is to deny Israel's; but it is quite the contrary. It maintains them. Whereas, blending them denies what is proper to the church, which is lost when you blend it with Israel: and so does it Israel's too; for each is what it is.

		<a class="footnote" name="#136:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>The reasoning as to the two periods ending simultaneously is perfectly put as regards the author's system; but I believe there is but the one (or last) half-week in the twelve hundred and sixty days and forty-two months. But it is a Jewish testimony. The beast can only blaspheme those who dwell in heaven. The times and laws are delivered into the hands of the beast in @Daniel 7 (i.e., Jewish ordinances, not the saints). He wears them out, no doubt, but the great body escape into the wilderness, to a place prepared of God for them; and, in spite of the beast, God will maintain a testimony. When this is closed, however, the beast will slay the witnesses. <p>The beast, moreover, is not Antichrist, though helped by the latter. That he is, was at the time of writing these papers a commonly accepted idea. It does not affect this point, save as facilitating the solution of what is a real difficulty, suggested above as an objection to the author's system -- how, if there be only one half week, the slaying all who do not worship him is consistent with the existence of the two witnesses. The preservation of the woman indeed shews that this effort of the beast or dragon to destroy all cannot pass the limits set to it by God. For the true Jewish worshippers as a body escape. So in chapter 11, the altar and temple, the true worshippers, are measured and owned of God; and it seems that a testimony also is preserved, two witnesses, or an adequate testimony to the God of the earth. The beast's power is general in chapter 13, over all dwellers in earth. Meanwhile, among the Jews, God preserves a testimony where only the second beast may be. <p>The two periods do not close simultaneously; but the beast's having power to continue forty-two months can hardly mean he continues in this character eighty-four. In this the author is right; but as to the nature of the testimony he is fundamentally wrong. The only change to be made in my argument is to apply it to the last half-week, not a previous one. For, whichever half-week it is, the testimony is not the church (according to the author himself), not Christianity The rest of the reply is all right. The reply is just, but the positive statements are not clear, though guarded; because the existence of two half-weeks is supposed possible; as (see the text above) the difficulty of another interpretation is urged. The difficulty is real; but it is no more than existed in the time of the Lord on earth (for I suppose the same period). Till His time was come no one could take Him; though the power of the beast, and apostate Jews, and Antichrist figuratively were there by anticipation. The positive truth I apprehend to be that, on the casting down of Satan to earth, the power of Christ's kingdom is so far set up; but this leaves three years and a half of the great rage of Satan, or the last half week -- the time of the two beasts characteristic power -- the time when the sacrifice is taken away, and times and laws are delivered into the beast's hands. <p>The rapture of the saints is quite another matter. This is not the kingdom: we are taken to the Father's house (as in @Luke 9 the kingdom was displayed on the mountain) -- the church's heavenly place, in the entering into the bright cloud whence the Father's voice issues. As far as this is shewn in @Revelation 12, it is in the taking up of the man-child. <p>I do not attach great importance to the question of one or two half-weeks; but I believe in the Revelation there is only one. In the first half the prince had favoured and deceived the Jews, but wickedly. But if so, the argument in page 213, beginning "nor does it seem to me," down to "inhabiters of earth," is without force. [Note to second edition, 1868.]

		<a class="footnote" name="#145:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>The whole argument and structure of that tract, which appears to me manifestly unsound, is based upon an incorrect citation of the passage, "Before all these things shall they lay their hands upon you." In the English translation (which I have no doubt at all is correct), it is, "Before all these they shall lay," etc. The difference being that the English translation refers to a distinct specific set of things just mentioned; whereas the writer generalises it, and puts it before another large class of events which have no connection, as he himself recognises, with the other. Now, all the statement of the tract depends on this, the tract bringing in thereby the whole Christian dispensation as in question. Now I believe most decidedly the English translation to be right, and the author of the tract wrong. But at any rate he ought not to give as a quotation what has been changed, without apprising the reader, and giving some reason for it, when the whole argument of his tract depends upon it.

		<a class="footnote" name="#146:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>There are two parts in the rule: "words ... in the Greek rendered by the participle, not by the indicative mood, and therefore do not imply present time, but an abstract relation." (Note here, the participle is not of the present tense.) Now this part is quite wrong; as @John 5:11, 15;@1 Timothy 6: 2 (and this would be the easier way of translating @Psalm 1: 3; @Hebrews 5: 5), and an endless number of instances prove. The other part is, that this rule as to abstract relation is confined to the present and perfect middle. And this is quite wrong too; as @Matthew 10: 4, and the passage @Revelation 11: 4 prove. The truth is, the one part of the rule proves the other part wrong. Because, if the participle is abstract, it certainly is not merely in the present and perfect middle that it is so used. Take chapter 10: 3, where we have this form twice, once the very same word, and see how either of the rules will apply. Indeed, it is so entirely wrong, and so upsets every real rule about time, which is governed by the tense and not by the question of participle and indicative mood, that it is useless to enter into further details. I should have to cite all the rules of interpretation for the Greek tenses. Neither is the present active with the article always abstract (as @Matthew 8: 10; chapter 21: 9, where you have it twice not abstract, and once abstract). So in the expression "who were" @Acts 11: 1, and at the beginning of Romans, 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, Ephesians, Philippians, changing case and gender as needed. But I need go no farther.

It is curious that they should be assured of subsequent blessing, and preservation for it, and yet not of the favour of God. That they might know they were not of the church, if the dispensation or time of the church were over, one might understand: but to be assured of blessing by God's favour, and that blessing "acceptance in Jesus" (page 113), and yet not know God's favour, is strange enough. Certainty of acceptance in Jesus in two years, without peace, is a state of soul perfectly impossible to exist. But let that pass now. <p>The statement in page 15 of the tract entitled "The day of the Lord," is entirely contradictory of this. "They will reject Him till they shall have been brought through the terrors of that day." Is assurance of acceptance in Him shortly, and consciousness of the truth of what is passed, and correctly anticipating the future (i.e. His coming), "rejecting him"?

It is denying unwittingly the necessity of redemption. Giving of life did not suffice. He must come by blood as well as by water; and this was what always straitened the heart of Jesus. He had this baptism to be baptised with. This was not a dispensational question, but a question of the necessity of redemption for all, in order to the enjoyment of the promises thereby. In the wisdom of God it could be, and was, dispensationally extended to the Gentiles; but it was essentially true that blood must be shed for all. As a Gentile, I could withal have no part till this middle wall of partition was broken down -- no part in the promises: and if men are pleased to call it the Israel of God, it is quite certain that Christ could not begin it as regards Gentiles on earth -- a Gentile could not be of it. But, as regards Israel also, the sure mercies of David are based on the resurrection of Christ. But "that he raised him from the dead, now no more to see corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David." So that, though He might be individually worthy, and have the power of resurrection and life in Himself, He could not commence anything while on earth. It would be life and blessing, without redemption, without blood. And such is not God's way -- we may boldly say, could not be; for it is but asserting man's universal sin and unfitness.

		<a class="footnote" name="#170:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>As to the critical remark, I am again obliged to say that it is more than questionable. I had not examined it particularly previously, so that I should have been disposed to let it pass as immaterial. But, being stated here, I have examined it. There is no example that I can find of a witness to a person being used with a genitive of the person. It is almost always used with the preposition "*peri*." When this preposition is left out, it is the dative, of which there are some examples in the New Testament: for the genitive of the witnesses and peri of the subject of witness, they are too numerous to quote. It is said, John bore witness to the truth; and Demetrius hath good report. (@John 5:33; @3 John 12; see also @3 John 3,6.) I may add from Herodotus (2,18), *my witness for the counsel*. Grammars give this; but I suspect it is an instance of another principle. There is an additional confirmation of this (even if @1 Corinthians 1: 6 were so taken) in the beginning of the Apocalypse, where Christ sent and signified what He had received of God, and the prophet bears record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ. Here it cannot, I apprehend, be doubted that the testimony of Jesus Christ is the testimony which He gave or sent and signified: and this is confirmed by the "all things [not '*and* all things'] that he saw." This testimony of Jesus Christ was the same thing as the spirit of prophecy. It was one and the same testimony. The spirit of prophecy was the testimony of Jesus Himself, in whose hands soever it might be. So that I have no doubt that it is *of*, and not *to*, Jesus. This would be so far material, that it would shew that the testimony alluded to in these passages was the prophetic testimony. No doubt the gospel was the testimony of Jesus. He is the truth, whatever the subject or instrument of testimony. But the general thought here was the prophetic testimony. Nor do I think it otherwise even in verse 9, because of the words "kingdom and patience." But I do not insist at all on this, because all true testimony is Christ's testimony. The only ground I can find at all for reading "*to* Jesus," is the exceptional ground that the preposition *peri* is sometimes left out, and the genitive retained. Of this I have found one example in a case of witnessing: -- when they call Homer as a witness of, etc., leaving out *peri*. But I think it will hardly be alleged that this exception to the habitual use of the word is uniformly followed in the Apocalypse, in face of the evident force of chapter 1: 1, 2. Wahl gives as certain what I have here alleged.

		Now, as to the critical differences, I do not attach very great importance to the translating the Greek '<i>huper</i>' "by" or "concerning.<a name=185:8></a>" But I think the English translators undoubtedly right.<a name=185:9></a> There is no doubt at all that it is a regular known use of the preposition.<a name=185:10></a> The truth is, it is its commonest use.<a name=185:11></a> I do not mean that in this common use it is always used with words of entreaty, but that it is used with them in its most ordinary sense, that is, "on account of"; which, with words of entreaty, we generally in English render "by" meaning "by reason of.<a name=185:12></a>" "I beseech you, on account of the coming of our Lord Jesus and our gathering together unto him.<a name=185:13></a>" When it is a motive, we say "for the sake of"; but the sense is really the most common usual sense of <i>huper</i>, to which the English word "for" most nearly answers, adding idiomatically "sake of" in certain cases.<a name=185:14></a>

Wahl was led, no doubt, by the known fact that it is the regular sense of huper with words of beseeching, as the translators have taken it. But the presbeuo huper seems, I apprehend, to control it in @2 Corinthians 5: 20. So that "I beseech you for Christ" means "in Christ's stead," as in the English translation. If not, it is a case in point. The passage is in @2 Corinthians 5, "we beseech for Christ." One of the Gregorys, however, uses this identical expression for "we beseech you by Jesus." The author formerly insisted on "on behalf of."

It is really Esdras 5: 46, which reads "*when the seventh month was at hand* (not near, but) come." The second is in the same book, chapter 9: 6.

"Present" or "existing" is its regular force. Sometimes "set in" might answer, as winter is set in, that is, is actually or fully come.

		<a class="footnote" name="#209:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>I have run through the "Thoughts on the End of the Age," published since on these two chapters. I cannot answer here in detail a tract of near forty pages; but I examined it to see if there were any answers to the objections I have stated briefly here. But it only makes the matter a great deal worse. It is taught there that those who depart as cursed into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels, are to come out of it again to stand with the rest of the dead before the great white throne mentioned in the Revelation, and be judged according to their works (@Matthew 25 being no more a judgment than any sinners dying). (See pages 22, 23.) I would only ask any person taught of God to read the passage referred to, and see how truth is dealt with to maintain a system. It is well to mention here that everything is changed in the teaching of the author. The wheat were risen saints staying, however short a time, on the earth previous to their ascension; now they are living ones in Christendom. The saints were to be in the tribulation, and it was a blessing from God to be prepared for it. The consciences of the saints well know this. Now I read of "escaping the tribulation as the saints will" (page 25 of the tract) -- a statement which led me to make these remarks. We were to be on earth till Jesus appeared, and to go up to meet Him when we saw Him; and @2 Thessalonians 1, and the Greek word for rest, or respite, as it was alleged (another unfounded criticism, by the by), with other passages, were quoted to prove that the tribulation was closed for the saints by the Lord's appearing. They then got respite. All this is given up, though many saints are still under the influence of this teaching. The tribulation, properly speaking, they are not in. And in fact they do not await His appearing at all, Christendom being reaped, and the saints caught up before the judgment of Antichrist, in which as a flash of lightning He appears in destruction. Judgment, we are told, begins at the house of God. The reader must not ask me to reconcile this with other contradictory statements which subsist. There seems to me no attempt at consistency in the author's statements, more than with the point he is at the moment upon, though here, perhaps, I am wrong. I suspect the secret of a good deal is that, having made his system, and having been forced to correct particular parts year after year because it was evidently contrary to Scripture, it ceased to agree with the other parts of his own system. At least this would explain a good deal of the contradiction. But this is the effect of having a system to maintain.

		Further, if Babylon receives "its final visitation at the coming of the day of the Lord," it is quite clear that the day of the Lord is used in a sense which does not mean the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ in judgment, but some inferior visitation, inferior as to the instrument.<a name=251:9></a> Because, on the author's own shewing (and I agree with him here) the destruction of Babylon takes place under the vials of God's wrath, before the Lamb, King of kings and Lord of lords, comes forth in judgment, nay, before He has received His commission to act (see page 215).<a name=251:10></a> So that it is some inferior instrumental visitation which destroys it, and which visitation of terror and judgment is called the day of the Lord.<a name=251:11></a>

		But then there is another difficulty.<a name=259:13></a> Not only is this general character attached to Babylon, not only was it one main thing that characterised her: she was drunk with their blood, so that the apostle was astonished at her (not at commerce being carried from the west to the east, as is curiously alleged, page 240).<a name=259:14></a> It is added at the close of chapter 18, at her final destruction, "in her was found the blood of all saints.<a name=259:15></a>" So that this attached itself specially to her on to the end.<a name=259:16></a> She was guilty of all the blood of saints.<a name=259:17></a> Whoever might be her instrument, she really was the guilty one.<a name=259:18></a> She inherited it; as Jerusalem had from Abel to her day, so Babylon all that, and much more.<a name=259:19></a> Surely it was not commerce.<a name=259:20></a> In Jerusalem's case it was the ecclesiastical power which was guilty, let kings or rulers have lent their hand or not.<a name=259:21></a> And who has been guilty in all ages of

		But to return: as regards "the destruction, not of the woman, but of the city," the answer is, the woman is the great city that reigns over the kings of the earth.<a name=268:11></a> What morally represents the city is the harlot who corrupts the earth with her fornications, and who was drunken with the blood of the saints: and this is the Babylon destroyed, burned with fire, in whom all the blood of saints in the earth is found.<a name=268:12></a> Moreover, if Antichrist destroy her, it is the ten horns or kingdoms as well, so that it is the nations (not of Jeremiah, no doubt, but the nations).<a name=268:13></a>

		Next, the attempted change of chapter 18 from a woman to a city cannot hold: because Babylon was fallen and become the cage of unclean birds, that is (according to the author), judged as a city, because the nations had been drunk with the wine of the wrath (poison) of her fornication.<a name=268:14></a> That is, she is the harlot of chapter 16: 2 who is judged.<a name=268:15></a> It is another voice which, because of the announced judgment, calls upon the people of God to come out of her, and not partake of her sins, that they may not of her plagues too which are to come upon her in one day.<a name=268:16></a>

		But if there be any meaning in the previous note, these verses refer to the previous period.<a name=270:10></a> So that even on this ground it is all wrong.<a name=270:11></a> As to the rest of the note, there is nothing of being on the point of seizing Jerusalem for the last time in <a href="../bible/Joel.htm#2">Joel  2</a>.<a name=270:12></a> In <a href="../bible/Zechariah.htm#14">Zechariah  14</a>Jerusalem is taken.<a name=270:13></a>

		The marginal reading of <a href="../bible/Zechariah.htm#12:2">Zechariah  12:2</a> has nothing of the kind stated, but just the contrary.<a name=270:14></a> <a href="../bible/Zechariah.htm#14:14">Zechariah  14:14</a> may be translated as in the English margin.<a name=270:15></a> But I prefer the common translation, because of what is taught in chapter 12, which certainly does not suppose Judah to be fighting against Jerusalem, but the contrary.<a name=270:16></a> Neither is the writer warranted in saying a part of Judah leagued with the invading Gentiles, because it is said "Judah" also shall fight.<a name=270:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another reason against the marginal translation (which is no doubt a very good rendering of the Hebrew) is, that the preceding verse speaks of the judgment consequent on the Gentiles fighting against Jerusalem, "a great tumult from the Lord of hosts.<a name=270:18></a>" Now this would seem a strange time to bring in "Judah also shall fight, as being leagued with the Gentiles.<a name=270:19></a>"

		That Israel is God's battle-axe against His enemies, I believe: but how against Babylon, if they are called to flee and deliver their souls because of the day of her visitation from the Lord?<a name=271:2></a> And where is the progressiveness of her desolation, when in one hour she is made desolate -- an instantaneousness which was used before to prove that it could not be the judgment on ancient Babylon?<a name=271:3></a> Moreover, the passage where the desolation is declared so sudden, when she is utterly burned with fire, because the Lord is strong that judges her, speaks of that very judgment from which the merchants, removed afar because of the smoke of her burning, wail it as come in one hour.<a name=271:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So that all this subverts the plain statements of the word.<a name=271:5></a> And if we take the letter of the prophecy alluded to in Isaiah, it refers to the destruction of Babylon by the nations.<a name=271:6></a> The Medes are stirred up against them.<a name=271:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is another most material objection to the whole of this statement.<a name=271:8></a> The events alluded to as Jerusalem are identified with the appearing of the Lord.<a name=271:9></a> Thus it is the nations are cut off, and thus it is that the remnant wails.<a name=271:10></a> But the judgment of Babylon is the wrath of God before the Lord comes at all.<a name=271:11></a> Nor can Israel be the battle-axe of the Lord's judgment while rejected and under wrath.<a name=271:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the next note on kings of the earth, there is surely a confusion between the kings of the earth and the ten horns.<a name=271:13></a> The ten horns had, long before according to the author, burned her with fire; and I do not see why they should mourn over her burning so much.<a name=271:14></a> But they are spoken of here in their character as kings, as the merchants and shipmasters in theirs.<a name=271:15></a> Whereas the ten horns are much more the power of the ten kingdoms in their general state.<a name=271:16></a> They may burn her, the kings may mourn over her: but the note evidently identifies the kings of the earth and the ten horns: but then the chapter contradicts itself.<a name=271:17></a> I do not feel it necessary to dwell on the last note.<a name=271:18></a> Miserable as the manufacturing system is morally, certainly England has done more to fill the world by emigration than all other nations.<a name=271:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On the whole, I conclude that the author's system as to Babylon is untenable, firstly, because the examination of the chapters of the Old Testament proves his use of them to be

		<a name=272>[Page 272]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		a violation of their plainest statements, and their application to the results of the latter day, as related in the Revelation, impossible.<a name=272:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Secondly, because the character actually attached to Babylon is another character than that given to her in the chapter itself: his only passage for the character of Babylon as a system in chapter 17 being drawn from chapter 18 which is her condition when the system alleged to be called Babylon is, according to the author, destroyed.<a name=272:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thirdly, because the Scriptures actually give another principle or mystery of iniquity which is to result in the apostasy or the man of sin, which is entirely different from the one asserted by the author.<a name=272:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Fourthly, because his statements as to the day of the Lord connected with it subvert his own system as to what that day is: the ruin of Babylon taking place under God's judgments before Christ takes the power, whereas the day of the Lord commences when the Son is invested with His appointed power.<a name=272:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Fifthly, because the statements of the author as to Antichrist contradict altogether the passages which he alleges as to the king of Babylon.<a name=272:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		His distinction of the woman and the city is equally unsustained.<a name=272:6></a> First, because the scriptures say the woman is the city; and next, to allege no other reason, because the kings are spoken of as committing with the woman of chapter 17 the sin for which the city of chapter 18 is judged.<a name=272:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not recapitulate all the reasons here -- merely what bring into relief some of the great principles.<a name=272:8></a> One can hardly over estimate the importance of the error as misleading as to the real evil of the latter day, and unsettling, by the loosest use of Scripture, every principle of sound interpretation.<a name=272:9></a> I trust God will keep His saints out of the prevailing snare of commerce.<a name=272:10></a> For they that will be rich will fall into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.<a name=272:11></a> That a warning against it may be useful in England is very possible; but the simple-hearted saint passes through it as a service, and has done with it -- he cannot with idolatry and ecclesiastical authority: it is the net of Satan himself.<a name=272:12></a>

So that the brightness of His coming would have taken place. But He comes in the clouds of heaven (@Matthew 24) when it is for the destruction of Antichrist. In page 204 of the "Thoughts," it is the harvest of Christendom. There must be then two comings in the clouds of heaven -- one for Christendom, and one afterwards for Antichrist, who has seen the other undismayed. The first would be the star-like appearing of page 333. The reader may believe these different appearings if he can.

		The truth is, the author cannot get over the fact that the saints are taken away, and that most important events happen before the Lord comes to destroy Antichrist.<a name=278:12></a> By making besides, and before that, a judging of the quick on the earth by the Lord, and a judgment of Babylon, which he has elsewhere placed previous to Christ's rising from the Father's throne, he has set aside the plain statements of Scripture as to the Lord's appearing in the destruction of Antichrist, and his own statements as to what essentially characterises the two ages, and made confusion as to the fact itself and the order of prophecy.<a name=278:13></a> He has chosen to introduce an unscriptural division of Roman earth and Christendom, and thus rejected Scripture, and his own statements too; and borne an involuntary testimony to a rapture of the saints before the judgment of the day of the Lord, and at the same time shewn his own system to be the mere fabric of his own mind.<a name=278:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		On page 304 I must remark that the dispensation of the fulness of times is surely not eternity.<a name=281:3></a> The heading up all things in Christ for the administration, of that fulness of times, is hardly the period after His having delivered up the kingdom: nor does the administration of the fulness of times or seasons signify eternity.<a name=281:4></a> It refers to the inheritance in which we are joint-heirs with Christ, when, having suffered, we reign, having meanwhile the earnest of the inheritance till the redemption of the purchased possession.<a name=281:5></a> After that, God is to be all in all, and the Son Himself subject, and not reigning as man.<a name=281:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		What follows has been already discussed: only I repeat there is never a hint in Scripture of the heavenly saints sharing the glory of the throne of David with Christ.<a name=281:7></a> The statement as to those who are raised to share millennial power is clearly unwarranted if taken as exclusive.<a name=281:8></a> "This is the first resurrection," is certainly not merely of those who died under persecution, nor indeed did all the twelve apostles die under persecution, for John himself did not.<a name=281:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The use of <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#65">Isaiah  65</a>, at the close of page 306, is clearly a misuse of it, as may easily be seen by reading verses 17 and 18; though all recognise that the earthly millennial is not the final state.<a name=281:10></a> But of this earthly millennial state -- so celebrated in the prophets that the whole earth is to break forth into singing and joy, that they are called to rejoice for ever in that which God creates -- we are told, little is said in the Revelation.<a name=281:11></a> It is such a time of imperfectness and evil.<a name=281:12></a> "The bride of the Lamb" "is kept apart<a href="#281:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> from the millennial earth, and is not brought from her heavenly elevation into the sphere below, until the millennial earth and heavens have fully passed away.<a name=281:13></a>" And yet Jerusalem is the "own city" of our system.<a name=281:14></a> And

But close systematic relationship and being brought into its closest adaptation is a strange way to keep apart. God will gather together in one all things, both which are in heaven and in earth.

It is indeed said, "in all the instances which imply active interference on the part of God." This may seem to modify the statement. But then, what does it amount to? Just a proof of the looseness of the statements made. "In chapter 13 no interference on the part of God is mentioned. Evil appears to reign as if God had forsaken the earth," etc. "But it is far otherwise. God will plead with men both in testimony and judgment: and this chapter 14 reveals" (page 417, 418). "The character of the events is clear, and their order." (See page 200.) "A preaching, etc., a testimony against Babylon, and a declaration of its doom -- a testimony against the beast, etc. -- an intimation that the time is come for the saints to enter into their rest, etc. -- the reaping-the vintage." Now, there is no testimony against Babylon at all, but a declaration of her doom as accomplished. But, if instances which imply active interference mean acts of God's unless this fall of Babylon be one, there are, in the whole series, just two, the harvest and the vintage. The rest are intimations, preaching, testimonies. So that the statement really comes to nothing at all, unless turning into a testimony against Babylon what is certainly no such thing, to avoid the subversion of his own system by the plain statement of Scripture.

One of the two other MSS which have the new reading almost always agrees with the ancient one which has it: the other is of the same family, as it is called. It is to be supposed that all the other MSS which do not want the passage favour the other reading. In this state of things I do not pretend to decide.

[Codex Sinaiticus reads "washed their robes," and I suppose it is the true reading altered by the church when redemption was forgotten, and works pretended to.]

		<a class="footnote" name="#326:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>And here I must add that Sir C. Brenton and the English translators are perfectly justified. This is the statement of Matthiae (English edition, Kenrich, London, 1837, 501, page 842), "The aorist in all the moods except the indicative and the participle, is usually expressed in Latin and English by the present." I had examined this before, only not so fully, and did not feel it necessary to enter into this additional critical matter. Matthiae adds, "But ... the aorist designates an action transient and considered independently in its completion, but the present a continued and frequently repeated action," etc. This remark will be found of every importance on the question of the use sought to be made of the text -- that is, as to what the Greek aorist for "I make" (@Hebrews 1: 13) or the Hebrew for this in @Psalm 110: 1, means. Because, assuming the remark of Matthiae just, we have revealed authority thus for using the act of setting as a "transient action, considered independently in its completion," and not as "present, continued, and frequently repeated action." Because the inspired New Testament has adopted the Septuagint translation, where the tense used precludes a continuous action, and confines the setting to a transient action, considered independently in its completion. Now, this is the question between the author and myself He says that this verse describes the Lord Jesus as seated ... waiting, Jehovah's throne acting for Christ. "There is no characteristic of the present period so essentially distinctive as this." In a word, it is a continuous action characterising a period. But the tense, sanctioned by the use of the Lord and His apostles, precludes this idea. It sanctions that on which I insist -- transient action, considered independently in its completion. It is the author, not I, whose question is with the New Testament. He is wrong as to the Greek, as well as in the sense attributed in his reasonings on the Hebrew.

		The difference is just this, "until I make, or set, thy foes a footstool for thy feet," and "until I shall have made" would both convey that Christ was to sit there till the act was done.<a name=328:15></a> But the latter gives, or gives room for, the idea of a continuous process going on of making or setting: for "until I shall have made" certainly tends to convey the idea of a process going on making; "until I make," an interval which elapses till the act of making takes place.<a name=328:16></a> Hence the new translation is the worse one of the two, because, while both suppose the thing done, the new conveys an idea which is not in the Hebrew, and which the Greek divinely recognised translation will not bear -- an idea which the author has taken up and followed out in his reasonings.<a name=328:17></a> To proceed, the author asks, Why then, may I not say that the throne of Jehovah is, throughout this dispensation, acting for Christ, with the view of finally setting His enemies a footstool for His feet?<a name=328:18></a> I do not here enquire whether the author may or may not say so; but it is not what he has said.<a name=328:19></a> What he has said

		is, that the first verse of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#110">Psalm  110</a>, which speaks of setting Christ's enemies for His footstool, speaks of Jehovah's throne acting for Christ through this dispensation: that is, clearly, that His acting is setting the footstool.<a name=329:1></a> For, if the verse speaks of acting, no other acting is spoken of but that.<a name=329:2></a> We have in page 21 and the note, a long reasoning that <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#110">Psalm  110</a>necessarily implies this continuous acting: "otherwise we must say that, for the last eighteen hundred years, the providence of God had ceased to control Satan," etc.<a name=329:3></a>; and then the last clause is applied to congregating the enemies as a footstool.<a name=329:4></a> It is all very well now to talk of what it implies, and say "otherwise" so and so.<a name=329:5></a> In the "Thoughts" we are told that the first verse spoke of this acting of the throne, and that hence this verse was distinctively characteristic of this dispensation.<a name=329:6></a> Now <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#110">Psalm  110</a>does no such things.<a name=329:7></a> It speaks of a definite "transient action," and not of a continuous one.<a name=329:8></a> There is, moreover (I refer to the third division in page 26), nothing about congregating enemies either, any more than forming or preparing the footstool.<a name=329:9></a> There is just simply setting or putting His enemies for His footstool.<a name=329:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I say then that the author did interpret <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#110">Psalm  110</a>, which speaks of setting enemies for a footstool, as the actings of Jehovah's throne, during and characteristic of this dispensation: none was so decidedly so.<a name=329:11></a> And if Christ's enemies were set for His footstool by the continuous actings of God's throne for Him, God was putting down the foes of Christ during the dispensation.<a name=329:12></a> But, further, I have <i>not</i> "assumed" that the author has said so; but that he has <i>not</i>, and complained of him for not doing it, because there was no sense in explaining "setting for a footstool" as the actings of God's throne all through the dispensation, unless it was the acting of the throne as so setting them (this being the only acting of the verse), and that then the statement amounted to putting down these foes.<a name=329:13></a> For if setting foes for a footstool signifies the continuous actings of power, it does mean putting them down.<a name=329:14></a>

		The fact is, the author attributed a meaning to the verse positively which it certainly has not.<a name=329:15></a> Now he says it implies it, otherwise God ceased to control, but that it states certain final actings of this kind during a period described in the Revelation.<a name=329:16></a> He was wrong.<a name=329:17></a> The verse does not state it.<a name=329:18></a> It states, or implies, nothing about it.<a name=329:19></a> It is not its subject.<a name=329:20></a> And, moreover, it speaks of no continuous actions at the close, during

These two passages serve as introductions to the period mainly spoken of. It may be well to add, to avoid all cavil, that, though the author places the sixth seal at the very close of Antichrist's reign, immediately preceding the manifestation of the Lord in glory, so that some of the preceding seals must be during his reign, he does not actually state when they are. But the observation in the text applies to the whole body of the book.

		ANSWER TO "A SECOND LETTER TO THE BRETHREN AND SISTERS WHO MEET FOR COMMUNION IN EBRINGTON STREET"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the three propositions by which Mr.<a name=344:1></a> Newton assumes the position of guarding the truth, and the faith of the saints (insinuating at the same time that others have departed from it, or placed it in jeopardy), as far as they are exact, they merely contain a truth which nobody ever doubted, nor called in question, nor even put in jeopardy, unless it were Mr.<a name=344:2></a> N.<a name=344:3></a> himself; namely, that all the saints will be finally in the resurrection likeness of the Lord Jesus the last Adam.<a name=344:4></a> But, beyond this general truth founded on the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus, held much more clearly and exactly than it is stated here, all, I say, beyond it, in these propositions, like all human articles, and specially the statements so constantly rashly hazarded by the author, is unscriptural and incorrect.<a name=344:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the first proposition, if the author simply means that, in the counsels of God, all the redeemed will partake of Christ's likeness in resurrection in an unearthly state, it is quite true.<a name=344:6></a> But if he means, in the very vague expression "resurrection as known in Christ," that there could be no resurrection but to an incorruptible state like Christ in glory, then he is quite wrong.<a name=344:7></a> Of this Lazarus is the proof.<a name=344:8></a> At his grave Christ stated that He was the resurrection and the life, and yet Lazarus was raised to an earthly life.<a name=344:9></a> Again, if the expression unearthly life means anything, and therefore if it be taken as an absolute proposition, the author is quite wrong.<a name=344:10></a> Unearthly life is an unscriptural and an almost unintelligible expression.<a name=344:11></a> The first man was of the earth earthy, and we are earthy like him; but unearthly life is not a scriptural thought.<a name=344:12></a> The second Man is the Lord from heaven, and we shall bear His image in resurrection.<a name=344:13></a> If the proposition means that resurrection bodies are not to be corruptible bodies, I suppose the faith of the saints is not likely to be in much danger as to this.<a name=344:14></a> If it means more, the case of Lazarus proves it false.<a name=344:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have, further, in reasoning on a plain common truth -- that the life of all the redeemed is life communicated from Christ and the same life, reasoning as if some saints denied it and the author were maintaining and contending for the truth-this extraordinary statement (page 14): "I cannot however see why there should be difficulty in receiving this; that He who was the Word of Life, created the new man in every saint, and endowed it with life," etc.<a name=345:10></a> Now, while the truth reasoned on is one believed, I apprehend, without any difficulty at all by all saints, I would ask, What does it become in the hands of the author?<a name=345:11></a> or what does he mean by creating the new man and endowing it with life?<a name=345:12></a> Is there a lifeless new man created like Adam's body from the dust and then endowed with life?<a name=345:13></a> or what is the doctrine meant to be conveyed here?<a name=345:14></a> for the words are plain enough.<a name=345:15></a>

		The remark, "the subjunctive aorist could not be rendered as though it were the present -- and this is all I contend for," etc.<a name=346:4></a>, is a curious one enough.<a name=346:5></a> The question is whether it can be rendered <i>by</i> the present, which is what Matthiae (English translation) says it is in English.<a name=346:6></a> The subjunctive aorist is rendered as though it were the subjunctive aorist, but in English by the present, which is what the author objected to.<a name=346:7></a> He has translated many examples given by that grammarian to shew that the aorist is a completed action.<a name=346:8></a> This is admitted and is not the point in discussion.<a name=346:9></a> We are all agreed on that, as I shewed in my former reply in answer to Mr.<a name=346:10></a> Tregelles's letter.<a name=346:11></a> The question is, Does the Greek aorist, as Matthiae states, describe a transient action completed, or a continuous acting so that the Greek for "until I make" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:13">Hebrews  1:13</a>) should describe and characterise a period?<a name=346:12></a> That is the question.<a name=346:13></a> Because <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#110:1">Psalm  110:1</a> was quoted as characteristic of the present period -- nothing so much so as that which it spoke of -- in order to connect the actings spoken of in the Revelation with that period (that is, with the present dispensation).<a name=346:14></a> My reply was, that there were no actings characterising a period spoken of in the passage, but Christ called up to sit until Jehovah should have done<a href="#346:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> a certain act.<a name=346:15></a> And that the act which the psalm spoke of was not characteristic of a period at all, but one isolated or transient act of authority at the close, spoken of as completed no doubt, but not characterising a period.<a name=346:16></a>

There is no characteristic of the present period so essentially distinctive as this. As soon as this verse ceases to apply ... our dispensation ends and the new age begins." Now, Christ's waiting is stated in these words: "Sit thou at my right hand until," etc. Now, reader, take the verse and see in what words it "speaks," in the remainder of it, of the power of the throne as acting for Christ. Is there anything at all else but setting foes for a footstool? What is it then that is characteristic of the present period? <p>Now compare the new translation: "Sit thou at my right hand until I shall, as in a moment, have set thy foes a footstool for thy feet." Is the acting here characteristic of the dispensation; or of a momentary act of authority, which places the enemies under Christ's feet at the close?

The reader will do well to pay attention to this passage, because it would certainly "go far" to destroy all title of sovereignty in God. For this reason; that a dispensational peculiarity does depend exclusively on that sovereignty; and this is objected to as producing any difference in result, because it "is something altogether independent of ourselves." I do not doubt God acts by His Spirit in forming for glory according to His purpose; but compare the statement of pages 18, 19, of this second letter, with @Matthew 20: 21, 23, or the parallel passage, as to the principle advanced. If the blood of Christ necessarily gave the same glory to all, that would be as true for the same dispensation as for different ones, and all must be exactly the same in present glory. But this is not pretended. Hence the value of Christ's blood is not in question at all. If any alleged there would be a difference in justification, or acceptance (perfect, full acceptance, or favour with God), then indeed the blood would be in question. Or, if it were supposed that Abraham, etc., were not with the saints in glory in the heavenly kingdom, this would subvert the truth too. But, while partaking of the glory of God, and likeness to Christ's glorious body, is true of all the redeemed, and while the value of the precious blood of Christ is not touched for any by those whom the author opposes, but estimated, as far as any one dare say so, in all its fulness and all its bearings, though doubtless infinitely below its true and immeasurable preciousness -- while, I say, this is untouched by those whom the author and his followers accuse of it, the sovereignty of God the Father, and the connection of the Spirit's work with glory, is seriously affected by the author's teaching.

This, which may be more doubtful because Scripture says so very little about it, still, I am not disposed to dispute; because there are passages which seem to say so, though, for reasons analogous to many of the author's, I feel it much more doubtful on account of Christ's being then (as man) subject as the head of the new family. But how, if he admits official differences in what is eternal, which I doubt (though I do not dispute, nor occupy the saints with, from the rarity of positive scripture testimony as to it) -- how, I say, if he admits it in what is eternal, can he charge his brethren as he does because they think a similar official difference possible merely in the kingdom of glory? Though I do not know, after all, any that have any very fixed thought about it. I charge the author with nothing at all here. I suspect that he, and all of us, are sufficiently ignorant, to hinder us, if we are wise, affirming anything very dogmatically about the matter, though it may be a very interesting subject of enquiry. As to the pretension of holding the truth, and guarding the truth, it is a pretension which must be left to those who make and those who believe in it. <p>Another point occurs to me which may have given rise to this charge: namely, saying that an Old Testament saint could not say, as a then present thing, I am united to a glorified Man in heaven, because there was none there.

Up to the death of Jesus He was putting man and Israel in the old state to the test to prove its hopeless badness; but He never dealt with the old as acting on it with the view of gathering. For God knew that man in the flesh was hopelessly bad.

		<a class="footnote" name="#360:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>This part of the author's argument is based on his unscriptural use of the word 'heavenly.' I use it in the sense of condition in which a thing is enjoyed, which is its scriptural use if we except the divine Person of Christ; the author, in that of the source from which it flows. I have said, "that the Divine life came from above I do not doubt," and "unless we use it in the vague sense, that everything from above is heavenly." Most certainly in @John 3, the Lord does not use heavenly in the author's sense. The author says, that the Lord so speaks to Nicodemus, because regeneration takes place on earth (page 9). This I do not believe; while, in the sense of Divine life from above, I have positively stated that it was from above, and I have distinguished this from a heavenly condition. Nor, though I have no objection to it in this sense, is "heavenly life" a scriptural expression; and I am accustomed to follow Scripture, nor am I disposed to be driven from it, by the accusations of men. I have not the least doubt that Divine life comes from above, comes from God, and from the Son, and by the power of the Spirit; but I do not think Scripture calls it heavenly, and I still prefer Scripture to the author's statements. I believe Scripture uses "heavenly" habitually in another way, and I prefer using it so still. I believe the Scripture use of terms perfect and accurate; and I think in swerving from them, we are in danger of obscuring and confounding the truth, as I judge the author has done. The author has departed from Scripture phraseology here, and I have not. At least, I have searched both my memory and a concordance, for the terms he uses, and I cannot find them. But I freely say here I do not believe he intends any error by the expression. I admit further that men may object to human expressions to avoid the truth meant under them. But I have stated over and over again, that I believe Divine life comes from above, from God. And the author must well know that this belief is that of all the brethren.

Provided the real glory of the church itself be recognised, I enter into no contest whatever as to the Old Testament saints being in it.

		The importance of it to the author is this, that he can thus set aside anything special as to the church in the present dispensation on the point of union: since it is not a living consequence of what is wrought by the living power of Christ, but as true before those united lived, or existed even by a natural life, as when they are regenerate.<a name=376:2></a> Hence the sitting in heavenly places in Christ has been said to be by faith merely; and its being so stated because of their Head being there, with whom they were now really and livingly one, so as to sit there in Him, has been treated as mysticism.<a name=376:3></a> Hence the desire of the author to affirm that "raised up together" is in Him as much as sitting together -- a construction the author would find it difficult to prove, though, for my own part, as it is affirmed of those actually quickened, I am aware of no scriptural principle against which it militates.<a name=376:4></a> All I desire is that the attention of the saints may be drawn to the source of this statement, that regeneration is in virtue of union; namely, that there is union without life at all.<a name=376:5></a> Nor will I go further than to ask, how far such a tenet can be considered as the safeguard of "the truth," and a ground for denouncing as subverters of the truth those who do not hold it?<a name=376:6></a> The present living union of the saints as Christ's body being thus really set aside -- regeneration being in virtue of union, which clearly therefore is not living union -- the church becomes either all saints from the beginning to the end of time; or a sort of model or pattern frame-work formed by the labours of God's servants down here: and such passages as <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>either this or a local church.<a name=376:7></a> The whole doctrine of the epistle to the Ephesians is thus entirely lost, as the chapter in 1 Corinthians is merged into a local or pattern church or body down here; and the power of the doctrine of the church's union with the Head as a real living vitalised body united to Christ, and filled with the Holy Ghost, is wholly lost.<a name=376:8></a> I would much press upon the reader to examine <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4">Ephesians  4</a>and <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>.<a name=376:9></a> He will soon be set clear in all this.<a name=376:10></a> Compare page 5 of "Second Letter.<a name=376:11></a>" "If I confound between what God did in exalting Christ and the church in Him, and what His servants did in constituting the church on earth.<a name=376:12></a>"

So instruction as to individual justification does not apply to the church as such, though the members of it in its fullest sense possess it; and it is for them.
