		<i>H</i>.<a name=2:11></a> I believe there are hidden wants everywhere.<a name=2:12></a> I do not say a new nature, a changed will, but cravings of a soul that has capacities beyond the sphere in which it is imprisoned; rarely shewing themselves in the toil and follies of life, but which press into notice on particular occasions through the disordered throng of thoughts which crowd the avenues and people the busy interior of a dissipated and care-burdened existence.<a name=2:13></a> But it is not of this I speak now.<a name=2:14></a> I think that the mass of the poor have more reality of thought than reasoners -- see more justly the true character of things.<a name=2:15></a> The occupation with labour gives this.<a name=2:16></a> They toil to exist.<a name=2:17></a> That is now God's ordinance.<a name=2:18></a> What they get outside it must be real.<a name=2:19></a> Speculation has no place here.<a name=2:20></a> They may know nothing of a revelation, but if they have the thought that there is one, they want one that is a revelation from God -- something He has told them, not an improved Shakespeare.<a name=2:21></a> If they have Diana and Jupiter, they take Diana and Jupiter as realities.<a name=2:22></a> If they are under the law of Moses, they will not spiritualize everything with Philo, or his modern imitators.<a name=2:23></a> They will take it as Moses gave it, or not at all.<a name=2:24></a> If they are idolaters, they will be idolaters <i>bona fide</i>, not readers of Lucian.<a name=2:25></a> If they are sceptical -- if this pervades the population -- not merely religion but the state is near its end.<a name=2:26></a> By that I mean society.<a name=2:27></a> When man speculates on the sanctions of social life -- when the divine ever-living power of faith is gone, what holds man subject to something superior to himself -- when what links man to man is gone, self is dominant, conscious that <a name=3>[Page 3]</a>

		<i>H</i>.<a name=3:11></a> God forbid.<a name=3:12></a> The revelation of God is, for me, the putting an immortal soul, through grace, in communication with the eternal fountain of blessedness, of light, of love -- with God Himself.<a name=3:13></a> Doubtless, most important revelations accompany it, necessary for the existence or full development of this.<a name=3:14></a> I have God manifest in the flesh.<a name=3:15></a> I have the blessed relationships of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, without which it is impossible for man to be thus connected with God.<a name=3:16></a> Besides, I have the Church united to Christ -- subjects into which I cannot enter now, but which (while, when revealed, they give to us conscious links of union with what is divine, and develop divine affections in the relationships they place us in) must be the subject of revelation.<a name=3:17></a> Man's mind cannot go beyond its own sphere.<a name=3:18></a> It is not God, and, if it is to be really elevated, must be elevated by something that is outside and above itself.<a name=3:19></a> That is, there must be a positive revelation of something not within the sphere of its own proper apprehensions.<a name=3:20></a> It may develop its own powers, it may create poetically what is within the sphere of those powers; but in the nature of things it cannot by itself get beyond itself.<a name=3:21></a> You may have Shakespeare to give all the scope of the human mind, all its workings, in a course of pictures, from its highest to its lowest forms, with a graphic truth which may interest in the most absorbing way minds inferior to his -- minds which cannot do this for themselves; but it is always and must be the human mind, and within the sphere of its own limits, or it would not be the human mind.<a name=3:22></a> The consequence is that, though it may elevate these inferior minds above their level, it contents them with man, and in result, by excluding God, degrades them from what they

		might be.<a name=4:1></a> Poetry is the effort of the human mind to create, by imagination, a sphere beyond materialism, which faith gives in realities.<a name=4:2></a> But then it cannot rise above the level of its source, whatever displays of force there may be by its being conducted in a secret channel, and not exposed to be wasted in the open intercourse of the world.<a name=4:3></a> In result, it sinks down to the level towards which all human nature runs, and then settles, not to rise again.<a name=4:4></a> There may be a certain subjective development of mind in its use, but no more.<a name=4:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>W</i>.<a name=4:6></a> But men speak of the inspiration of Shakespeare and others -- even of ordinary men under happy or religious influences.<a name=4:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>H</i>.<a name=4:8></a> There is a confusion of language and thought between revelation and inspiration.<a name=4:9></a> We may use the latter term figuratively of the animated efforts of the human mind, compared with the platitudes of ordinary life, or, as is habitually done, of the instrumental power by which unknown truths are communicated by God to the human mind.<a name=4:10></a> But revelation is quite another thing, of which inspiration in the highest sense is but the form or instrument (for it is both) -- that is, the actual presentation to us of an object, or a truth, or a fact not otherwise known.<a name=4:11></a> Here I get an additional object not otherwise obtained for the human mind.<a name=4:12></a> As to will, moral or spiritual qualities, the mind may or may not be capable of discerning or appreciating it.<a name=4:13></a> That is a theological question, a most important one, but not exactly our topic now.<a name=4:14></a> But revelation is the declaration, the actual promulgation, of otherwise unknown truths -- often those which could not otherwise be known.<a name=4:15></a> Sometimes of those which in the actual condition of the individuals could not be known.<a name=4:16></a>

		There is another enormous moral mistake, that internal power is that by which man advances in the moral scale of being.<a name=4:17></a> Power in man is limited to what man is.<a name=4:18></a> That is no advance beyond what he is.<a name=4:19></a> An acorn may become an oak, but in its nature it is never but an oak.<a name=4:20></a> Even so power is not the real thing that elevates man (though in man there is another question: an oak is not a corrupt fallen thing).<a name=4:21></a> "I can do all that may become a man; who can do more is none.<a name=4:22></a>" There is man's power at its limit.<a name=4:23></a> If I may quote one who amongst men had hardly his like, I find more; I only say now, he pretends to more: let history and facts judge of his claim: -- "I can do all things through him that strengtheneth me.<a name=4:24></a>" Here I find another and divine source of strength carrying him morally beyond man.<a name=4:25></a>

		But (to state to you distinctly the principle I refer to) a dependent being (and a creature is a dependent being or a revolted one, perhaps a revolted dependent one) is elevated by its wants, not by its powers.<a name=5:1></a> Its powers may develop it, but cannot elevate it.<a name=5:2></a> But if I have a want, which is not power, and there is that which meets my want outside myself, I become acquainted with it.<a name=5:3></a> I appreciate it, not by power, but by dependence on the quality by which my want is supplied.<a name=5:4></a> Hunger is not power; but it enjoys and appropriates food which gives power.<a name=5:5></a> Weakness is not power; but if my languid body leans on kindly and supporting strength, my felt weakness makes me know what strength is.<a name=5:6></a> But I learn more by it.<a name=5:7></a> I learn the kindness, patience, goodness, readiness, help, and perseverance in helping which sustain me.<a name=5:8></a> I have the experience of independent strength, adapted, suited to my weakness.<a name=5:9></a> I know its capacity to sustain what is beyond itself, which is not my power elevating itself in internal development -- self-filling power.<a name=5:10></a> There is love.<a name=5:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this relationship of wants to that which supplies them in another is the link between my nature and all the qualities of the nature I lean on, and which supplies these wants.<a name=5:12></a> I know its qualities by the way it meets my not having them -- my want of power.<a name=5:13></a> It is a moral link too.<a name=5:14></a> I know love by it, and all the unfolding of goodness; self-power never does.<a name=5:15></a> The exaltation of what is human in itself is the positive loss of what is divine, that is, infinite positive loss.<a name=5:16></a> There is immense moral depth in the apostle's word: When I am weak, then am I strong.<a name=5:17></a> And the more I have of God, and the more absolutely it is so, the more I gain.<a name=5:18></a> All is appropriated, but self is destroyed.<a name=5:19></a> It is not that I cease to exist, or to enjoy.<a name=5:20></a> It is not a Buddhist or stoical pantheistic absorption into God.<a name=5:21></a> I am always the conscious I for ever; yet an I which does not think of I, but of God in whom its delight is.<a name=5:22></a> It is a wonderful perfection -- an absolute delight in what is perfect, but in what is perfect out of ourselves, so that self is morally annihilated, though it always is there personally to enjoy.<a name=5:23></a> This is partly now in the form of thirst, though there be enjoyment -- hereafter, for those who have it, perfect enjoyment face to face.<a name=5:24></a> God alone is sufficient for Himself, is aujtarce", and hence not self-seeking, for that comes from not being satisfied, not sufficient for self.<a name=5:25></a> Out of Him the aujtarceia is pride, satisfaction with misery, and itself a sin; dependence is the right, holy, loving, excellent place.<a name=5:26></a> To be independent, if we are not God, is folly, stupidity, and a lie, living in a lie.<a name=5:27></a> If we are God, we

	<div class="paragraph">
		must be the only one, or we are not it at all.<a name=6:1></a> Yet in Christianity we are made partakers of the divine nature, in order to our having the fullest capacity of enjoyment; but for that very reason we have (He being perfectly revealed) such a knowledge of Him as makes us undividedly delight in His infinite excellence, and makes our dependence to be our deriving in love from infinite excellence, and in our normal state unmingled delight in it.<a name=6:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The connection of the derivative and perfect objective character of divine life and love is what is so brought out in John, particularly in his epistle; it makes its essential depth and beauty, and, when not seized because not possessed, its difficulty and apparently mystic character.<a name=6:3></a> It is this which makes the Trinity have so sure and perfect a place to the soul.<a name=6:4></a> I do not use this as a proof, save as the real present enjoyment of anything proves to the heart it is true.<a name=6:5></a> In the Father I have absolute Godhead in its own intrinsic permanent perfection.<a name=6:6></a> In the Son I find what is divine (if not in the same perfection, I have not God revealed) brought out in man, fully wrought into all that is sinlessly human; so that it is not only suited to man but to be apprehended (if morally capable of it) by man.<a name=6:7></a> <i>All the fulness</i> of the Godhead dwells in Him bodily, at the same time in the personal relationship of Son.<a name=6:8></a> And the Holy Ghost (besides my having a life from God, and so being partaker of the divine nature) is the power in me (morally as well as in power of apprehension) by which I apprehend and enter into communion with God, with the Father and the Son; while this presence of the Holy Ghost secures in my feebleness the truth and purity of this communion, because any inconsistency grieves Him; and He works in the conscience by the revelation of God, though not then in communion.<a name=6:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now you must see that there is much that must be directly revealed in such subjects as these.<a name=6:10></a> Even of what is bodily brought before us, as in the life of Jesus on earth, though in itself a revelation, an account of it is needed, not only to perpetuate it -- which is quite true -- but also to give a divine view of the thing revealed, which, it is evident, man by sight would have hardly seized in its full extent or bearings; or could not in its links with other unseen or unknown things.<a name=6:11></a> But besides this we want a divine account of what is short of the revelation of God Himself to man; namely, a revelation of the terms on which man stood with Him, and of His ways with man.<a name=6:12></a> This will involve man's imperfection, and, if historically given, the expression of that imperfection, but will be God's account of it.<a name=6:13></a>

		<i>W</i>.<a name=7:1></a> Yes; but it is just when we get on this ground that there are difficulties and objections which perplex the mind difficulties I mean both as to the record of truth, and as to the moral proprieties of evangelical truths.<a name=7:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>H</i>.<a name=7:3></a> I do not deny it, not that I judge they are very weighty.<a name=7:4></a> But as to the first point, it does not surprise me that, in a record which reaches over some fifteen hundred years or more, committed to the care of man -- for that it professes to be -- I should find the traces of the infirmity of man, while its state in those circumstances, and its whole history, is the most striking possible proof of the providence of God.<a name=7:5></a> It is of the essence of a revelation made in grace, to be adapted to man, connected with man, to pass through the medium of man's moral nature, and be put, so to speak, into his hands.<a name=7:6></a> It could not draw the sympathies of his nature in the same way if it did not.<a name=7:7></a> It would not associate man with God, if it did not connect God and man in interests, affections, moral nature, if it did not give a common ground of moral association.<a name=7:8></a> Hence the New Testament does it much more than the Old -- is more familiar, more human, takes its place more in every element of human circumstances.<a name=7:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the Old, after the revelation of the creation, as a starting-point and sphere of God's manifestation by and in man, I find history as to which I am left to judge morally -- most instructive history, if I know how to use it; but a public government of this world, or occasional relationships between God and man, in which I have to form a spiritual judgment how far men are up to the height of a true association with God.<a name=7:10></a> For the true link was not yet formed by the full revelation of God in grace: only a partial revelation of it anticipatively, and particular communications; and God dwelt in the thick darkness; then oracular dicta, a "Thus saith the Lord" -- God shewing grace, speaking to man, but speaking Himself alone -- no doubt by the mouth of men, His word using them so as to approach man in sovereign goodness where man had failed.<a name=7:11></a> The word of the Lord came to such a one, it is said.<a name=7:12></a> But it was as an instrument, a channel of communication, so that they searched out the meaning of their own prophecies.<a name=7:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the New, I find a history of perfection; for God is manifest in the flesh.<a name=7:14></a> It is not communications from a God not revealed, but the revelation of God.<a name=7:15></a> Hence it is perfect on His part in that association of which I spoke.<a name=7:16></a> It is the Word made flesh -- God in man moving in the circumstances of men amongst men, and is

	<div class="paragraph">
		not what I have to judge of spiritually in man, but the perfection which judges all else -- the truth, an object, which, if I have a heart capable of seeing it and loving it, engages it absolutely, because it is God, because it is man, because it is God in man and I am a man; the perfect object linking itself with every moral delight of my new nature, meeting at the same time every want of my moral being in perfect grace; finding in those wants, yea, even in my sins, the occasion of manifesting grace to it, of making me know God by them -- at least by the perception of the way He meets them in love.<a name=8:1></a> It forms and fills the capacities of my nature in what is divine, as beauty does a capacity to perceive it.<a name=8:2></a> Yet it meets all my wants with good, which puts man in his right place of dependence, in grace, on God; but gives entire confidence, because He is come as myself, as far as being a man in everything but what is a defect in man (that is, sin).<a name=8:3></a> He is that by which I judge everything, not which I have to judge as a history of man, though it be of man in various relationships with God.<a name=8:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Besides, I have in the New Testament another immensely important element of our relationship with God.<a name=8:5></a> This blessed One was rejected.<a name=8:6></a> Such is the history we have.<a name=8:7></a> It is the full discovery of this solemn truth, that the carnal mind is enmity against God.<a name=8:8></a> And the other part of the New Testament is the unfolding of the way in which, through God's being sovereign in love over man's evil, He has, in the perfect display of righteousness, been able -- glorifying Himself perfectly in the work of Christ in the putting away of evil -- to associate man in his new nature with Himself, out of the reach of the evil, and according to His own perfection, where the feebleness and the misery will and can exist no longer.<a name=8:9></a> Thus a Perfect heavenly relationship is formed, ourselves holy and without blame before Him in love, and His own children in His house, associated with and like Him who became a man for us in grace.<a name=8:10></a> To this are added the various exercises accompanying the knowledge and faith of this in weakness, and the fitting display of the fruits of it in those partakers of this life, in connection with heaven, but in the weakness of an earthly vessel.<a name=8:11></a> This display of the divine in man, and the bringing man up to God in His own blessedness, form the contents of the New Testament: we may add, the setting the world right ultimately, in peace, by the divine government in man.<a name=8:12></a>

		What I have just remarked, if you examine it a little closely, you will find to be the difference between the writings of Paul and John, and the reason of the special attractiveness of the

	<div class="paragraph">

		<i>H</i>.<a name=9:11></a> I was going to say a word on them.<a name=9:12></a> They have their own and a very peculiar place.<a name=9:13></a> We have no devotional pieces prepared for the Church in the New Testament, which gives this point more importance, and I think additionally shews the grace of God, and the perfect and divine harmony of that book we call the Bible.<a name=9:14></a> I say, that book; for, though there be many authors instrumentally, it is one book -- though our <i>Bibliotheca Sancta</i>, as Jerome says.<a name=9:15></a>

		In the New Testament the saints (having the knowledge of perfect divine favour, the love of God shed abroad in their hearts by the Holy Ghost given to them, and that blessed Spirit dwelling in them) are supposed to be capable of praising God freely.<a name=9:16></a> It is expressed in a very wonderful manner in Psalm 22.<a name=9:17></a> After giving prophetic utterance to the sorrows of Christ, and His being forsaken of God, He is heard from the horns of the unicorn.<a name=9:18></a> As soon as He enters into the full light of His Father's countenance, according to the power of redemption and the work that He had wrought, He declares His Father's name, as He thus knows it, to His brethren: He puts them in relationship with the Father as He is Himself; as He historically did, "Go tell my brethren .<a name=9:19></a>.<a name=9:20></a>.<a name=9:21></a> I go to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.<a name=9:22></a>" This was a position entirely new, consequent upon His resurrection, in which He had not only taken a new place as man, but acquired it for them.<a name=9:23></a> Then in the psalm He says, "In the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.<a name=9:24></a>" Our praises then are the free and joyful following of Christ in the praises which He can

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And remark here another point of vast importance in the present day when development is so much spoken of.<a name=34:3></a> What God reveals is revealed perfect in its place and for its purpose at first; and man declines from it.<a name=34:4></a> There is progress in the character of God's revelations, compared with one another; but in themselves, none.<a name=34:5></a> There cannot be progress in a revelation.<a name=34:6></a> It is itself.<a name=34:7></a> There may be in revelations.<a name=34:8></a> A revelation is given perfect.<a name=34:9></a> Man declines from it or corrupts it.<a name=34:10></a> That man should make progress in a revelation denies its nature.<a name=34:11></a> Now the things Dr.<a name=34:12></a> Temple speaks of were revelations -- different in nature, but still revelations.<a name=34:13></a> And when I come to Christ, I find another immensely important truth -- to talk of progress here is blasphemy.<a name=34:14></a> He is God manifest in flesh.<a name=34:15></a> He is perfection.<a name=34:16></a> Hence the apostle John tells us to abide in that which we have heard from the beginning.<a name=34:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And I find here too a principle of scripture, the ignorance and denial of which is the root of all these errors and modern reasonings.<a name=34:18></a> The scripture (I am not now to enquire whether its <i>whole system</i> be false) presents Christ as a <i>second</i> man, a new starting point of the human race, the last Adam.<a name=34:19></a> There is no progress of man in flesh spoken of: he is to put off the old man, or has done so, and put on the new, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.<a name=34:20></a> He is to reckon himself dead, he is crucified with Christ.<a name=34:21></a> He speaks of when we <i>were</i> in the flesh.<a name=34:22></a> That is, the blessed and admirable doctrine of scripture is the absolute moral judgment of man as man, a child of Adam in flesh, because sin is there; and, through the delight the new man has in God, he cannot bear this.<a name=34:23></a> He has crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts, and lives as alive to God in the last man.<a name=34:24></a> "I am crucified with Christ; nevertheless, I live: yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.<a name=34:25></a>"

		There were four principles as it seems to me at work in heathenism: -- the instinct of a supreme Being, or a superior one, at any rate, above man, impossible to be got rid of; heroism, or the deification of ancestors, traceable everywhere, and connecting itself, in its earlier and oriental phases, with Noah and his family and the ark (the idea is carried to excess by Bryant, but it seems to me incontrovertible); thirdly, the stars, as something wonderful, instinct with movement, and acting on the earth; and, lastly, what led to such horrible corruption, the sense of a generative power of nature, partly abstract, partly running through every sphere of thought and connected with the ruin of nature, and a certain resurrection in power, which linked it with day and night, and summer and winter.<a name=81:13></a> This, helped by various traditions, formed various systems; but all of man without God, to be found if at all, as the <i>aguestos Theos</i> in India, in certain respects, the most elevated, but the most monstrous, more of God's interest in man and His coming down, though there was Apotheosis -- in Egypt one more wise and applied to human morality and organization, yet the same system thoroughly, with more of the sentiment of a definite judgment of God, and conflict of good and evil, in the history of Osiris, Amenti, and Typhon, dead men not execrated were called justified -- in Greece, the lowest and poorest of all, which made man and poetry everything (gods became men, or swans, or bulls, to indulge their passions).<a name=81:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>H</i>.<a name=87:8></a> I shall most gladly accept your proposal: I cannot pretend to be a very scientific geologist, but the very objections of infidels you have referred to have made me examine it in the results professed to be arrived at, if I have not the science of details.<a name=87:9></a> These would require one to consecrate, to say the least, a large portion of a life to it and to the kindred sciences of comparative anatomy, and natural history, and of scientific botany; and this I neither can nor would I do.<a name=87:10></a> But our main object will be scripture, and, to tell you the honest truth, while these Essayists are <i>very</i> ignorant of scripture, I have not learnt to trust the depth of their science on any point.<a name=87:11></a> But our object will be: Is the scripture, viewed as a divine revelation, inconsistent with the facts discovered in the earth's structure?<a name=87:12></a> I do not say, with the conclusions of geologists, for it will be found that these are not very solid.<a name=87:13></a> The discoveries are full of interest, the results extremely uncertain.<a name=87:14></a> But some collateral subjects will meet us, which will diversify our conversation.<a name=87:15></a> You must always remember, that it is the habit of rationalist infidels to assume, that what their doctors, or rather doubters, have laid down as hypotheses are admitted truths -- things as unfounded as possible.<a name=87:16></a> It is one of its common deceits to allude to in passing, as to an admitted truth, what, if they had to prove it, they would find themselves utterly at a loss to do so.<a name=87:17></a>

		<i>H</i>.<a name=94:5></a> From Genesis to Revelation, there are two ways of speaking of God, either as the one divine Being in contrast with men; God known as God (only that it is applied to the representations of His power as such, whether angels or judges hold that place); or in known revealed relationships with men.<a name=94:6></a> Of these relationships (besides that of Most High, in which He takes His great power and reigns -- is possessor of heaven and earth) there are three, Almighty, Jehovah, and Father -- the last never revealed till Christ the Son came.<a name=94:7></a> Elohim was revealed to Abraham as Almighty.<a name=94:8></a> He was to trust in Him in that character.<a name=94:9></a> It was to be the object of faith.<a name=94:10></a> To Israel, He was revealed as Jehovah, and He was to be known and trusted as such; to us, as Father, and especially as Holy Father, in which name He keeps us, and we who have believed in the Son, know and trust Him.<a name=94:11></a> Thus, in Exodus 6 Elohim specially tells Moses that He had revealed Himself to the fathers by His name El-Shaddai, God Almighty, but not by that of Jehovah, which He now took with Israel; and Christ particularly notices that He had manifested the Father's name to the disciples -- had declared and would declare it, the Holy Ghost becoming a spirit of adoption in us.<a name=94:12></a> Hence the apostle, beautifully connecting all these revelations of God, says (2 Corinthians 6: 18), I will be a Father to you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.<a name=94:13></a> That is, He who had been the God of Abraham as Almighty, and the God of Israel as Jehovah, now took His name and place of Father.<a name=94:14></a> Surely, He was ever Father in respect of the Son, ever Almighty, ever Jehovah; but He had not taken it as a name of known relationship.<a name=94:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But to return to the point I insist on.<a name=122:8></a> Christianity is a religion of immense facts -- facts which contain unspeakably important principles, but facts which connect those principles with God (being a revelation of Him), and not with man's thinkings or aspirations.<a name=122:9></a> Thus "the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father), full of grace and truth .<a name=122:10></a>.<a name=122:11></a>.<a name=122:12></a> .<a name=122:13></a> For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.<a name=122:14></a>" "I," says Jesus, "came forth from the Father, and came into the world: again, I leave the world and go to the Father.<a name=122:15></a>" Now principles are here: law contrasted with grace and truth; but the former in the facts which happened at Sinai; the latter in the fact that the Son of God is come from heaven into this world.<a name=122:16></a> And the essence and substance of Christianity was to believe that this person was the Christ, was the Son of God; it was to believe these facts which He asserted of Himself, or His apostles after Him declared to be so, alleging that they worked miracles to aid men to believe.<a name=122:17></a> Christ declares that, if men did not believe Him, they would die in their sins; that he who believed on the Son had everlasting life; that he who believed not was condemned already.<a name=122:18></a> He declares that nobody had ascended up to heaven so as to tell of heavenly things, but He who came down from heaven; but that He spoke that He knew, and testified that He had seen.<a name=122:19></a> Paul, too, for whom incarnation was so spiritual, sees that just One returned into glory, and hears the voice of His mouth, that he might be, as he insists he was, an eye-witness that in very deed He, who thought it no robbery to be equal with God, had made Himself of no reputation, and taken on Him the form of a servant, and was found in fashion as a man.<a name=122:20></a> Although his mission was mainly to shew man righteously exalted to heaven, John's to shew God come down in grace to the earth, still the same great facts are distinctly declared by him as by all.<a name=122:21></a> Stephen declares the
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we take other facts constituting the bases of Christianity -- the incarnation; it lies at the outset and foundation of its history that Christ was not born as men are born, but conceived of the Holy Ghost; that a holy thing was born of Mary, through this miraculous interposition.<a name=123:2></a> This fact gives us a sinless man born of God -- a Son of man, indeed, but a Second man, a last Adam.<a name=123:3></a> An immense fact, involving an immense principle, completely brought into light by the rejection and death of this blessed One (for man, with all his analogous revelations out of living hearts, would none of a living Saviour; He was by wicked hands crucified and slain): the principle that man was a hopeless sinner and a new man to be set up.<a name=123:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But then comes another fact.<a name=123:5></a> The Saviour rises; the power of death is destroyed.<a name=123:6></a> I do not know what affinity, or deep echo, there is of resurrection in men's minds.<a name=123:7></a> I have not heard it.<a name=123:8></a> It has not reached the world of history.<a name=123:9></a> In what dell has Dr.<a name=123:10></a> Williams been where its echo has sounded concealed from all?<a name=123:11></a> The sound of resurrection once reached the ears of instructed men; but what echo did it bring back?<a name=123:12></a> When they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked; some, happily startled at the strange sound which spoke relief to dying man, said, "We will hear thee again of this matter.<a name=123:13></a>" Death -- ah!<a name=123:14></a> its echo has sounded far and wide.<a name=123:15></a> Yea, it needs none.<a name=123:16></a> It speaks in its own voice on the right hand and on the left.<a name=123:17></a> It says, Who can escape me?<a name=123:18></a> who can tell what has brought me?<a name=123:19></a> who shall return out of my hand again?<a name=123:20></a> Is Paul wrong who tells that sin brought my terror-striking power on man?<a name=123:21></a> Who can tell where I bring those on whom I lay my hand?<a name=123:22></a> Is it to judgment?<a name=123:23></a> Where is it?<a name=123:24></a> Who has returned to tell the tale?<a name=123:25></a> What affinities shall help me here?<a name=123:26></a> What living hearts tell me more than I know?<a name=123:27></a> They fear or hope like me.<a name=123:28></a> Death makes them as serious as it makes me.<a name=123:29></a> If Christ be my God, it is a gain, the brightest moment of life; it is to depart and be with Him.<a name=123:30></a> But if not, who of these fancied revealers has ever revealed what is beyond?<a name=123:31></a> Hope.<a name=123:32></a> Yes; since Christianity, infidels can.<a name=123:33></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		No doubt aspirations there were before in men's hearts, through the moral desolation of the world; prophecies too, before Christ, which, in a chosen and called people, kept alive the hope of something better; and every Christian of course believes that these facts, and the principles of grace and truth they involve, are received in many living hearts since, with more or less depth of feeling, and find an echo there.<a name=124:3></a> But the prophecies were not the thing prophesied of, the aspirations were not the divine answer that met and more than met them.<a name=124:4></a> Nor is the blessed echo in the believer's heart, he well knows, the fact that has awakened it -- that heavenly sound which it echoes with joy in its praises.<a name=124:5></a> There is realization of it all, living realization, affinity, because the believer is partaker of the divine nature.<a name=124:6></a> If God be love, the believer loves.<a name=124:7></a> If God be holy, the believer is made partaker of His holiness.<a name=124:8></a> Is Christ glorified?<a name=124:9></a> The believer will be like Him, and seeks to be spiritually like Him now.<a name=124:10></a> But the person of Christ, His death, His resurrection, remain great and unchangeable facts.<a name=124:11></a> He does not speak of revelations of Christ (i.<a name=124:12></a>e.<a name=124:13></a>, by Him), and affinities in other men's minds.<a name=124:14></a> But he knows that the Son of God is come; he knows that the Father sent the Son; that Christ is a person come down from heaven, so that He could reveal what is there (not merely aspire after it); that He loved us and gave Himself for us -- appears in the presence of God for us; that we have forgiveness of sins through Him -- salvation in no other; and that if He was God upon earth, the Word made flesh, He is man in heaven.<a name=124:15></a>

		"The second factor of revelation is the finite, or external.<a name=147:3></a> This mode of divine manifestation is, in the first place, a universal one -- the universe is nature.<a name=147:4></a> In a more special sense, it is an historical manifestation of divine truth through the life and teaching of higher minds among men.<a name=147:5></a> These men of God are eminent individuals, who communicate something of eternal truth to their brethren.<a name=147:6></a>" "The difference between Jesus and the other men of God is analogous to that between the manifestation of a part and the totality and substance of the divine mind.<a name=147:7></a>" I cannot follow the wild idealism of Bunsen in all its details.<a name=147:8></a> I may give as an example of it his interpretation of "Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth, they that have done good to the resurrection of life, and they that have done evil to the resurrection of damnation.<a name=147:9></a>" He translates, he says, from Semitic into Japetic language; so he speaks thus: "The history of mankind will prove to be the judgment of God.<a name=147:10></a> Nations will perish by this judgment, and new nations will arise, and the truth and justice of God will become manifest as well by the destruction of empires as by the awakening of new national life.<a name=147:11></a>" This is not exceptional.<a name=147:12></a> The Son having life in Himself, as the Father in Himself, and authority to execute judgment, means -- "This new period of mankind is now beginning; individuals of all nations will be awakened by divine consciousness [<i>nota bene</i>], and in process of time this divine principle in man will become the principle of all social relations, governments, and states.<a name=147:13></a>"

		Let us now see how Bunsen's statement as to revelation embodies the evil principle I have referred to.<a name=155:11></a> He says, "Such a direct communication of the divine mind as is called revelation has necessarily two factors which are co-operating in producing it.<a name=155:12></a> The one is the infinite factor, or the direct manifestation of eternal truth to the mind <i>by the power which that mind has</i> of perceiving it; for human perception is the correlative of divine manifestation.<a name=155:13></a>" Now, absurd as this is, it is plain enough.<a name=155:14></a> It is Philo's <i>orthos logos</i>, right reason, and faith, or the reason and conscience of the new infidel school.<a name=155:15></a> A manifestation <i>to</i>, by the power of perceiving, is absurd -- absurd in every case.<a name=155:16></a> It supposes an object, but an object by a power of perceiving.<a name=155:17></a> Now God can will an object, but needs then no revelation, of course.<a name=155:18></a> If man perceives, he must have something to perceive; it is not manifested by his power to perceive; or he creates, or has the divine nature, with its thoughts, as a given mind.<a name=155:19></a> This is just Philo, and is false, metaphysically and morally, because he is not infinite, and he is evil.<a name=155:20></a> Scripture makes the contrast, and refers the knowledge of the divine mind to the believer only and the Holy Ghost who shews things to us.<a name=155:21></a> "What man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him?<a name=155:22></a> so no man knoweth the things of God but the Spirit of God.<a name=155:23></a> Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things which are freely given to us of God.<a name=155:24></a>" A man knows the things of a man by the spirit of man; the things of God (these are new, freely given things, objects not inherent in the mind), the Spirit of God only.<a name=155:25></a> He is given to them that believe, takes the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>H</i>.<a name=160:12></a> First of all you must remark, that evidences suppose either reluctance to receive or difficulties inherent in man as to the reception of truth.<a name=160:13></a> If man's mind met the truth as such at once, there would be no need of any evidences, no need of our new school investigating so much; but men do reason to prove the truth (i.<a name=160:14></a>e.<a name=160:15></a>, it is not intuitively known or necessarily received).<a name=160:16></a> The new school declare the human mind productive of truth as being an intelligence which is the divine word in finite action in man.<a name=160:17></a> Christianity declares the truth to be revealed in and by Christ, and those sent by Him; and, as to ordinary men, He has declared, "Because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.<a name=160:18></a>" And again, "He was in the world, and the world knew him not.<a name=160:19></a> He came to his own, and his own received him not.<a name=160:20></a>" "The light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not.<a name=160:21></a>" That truth was found by man is false; it was not.<a name=160:22></a> He arrived at "What is truth?<a name=160:23></a>" Christ came to bear witness to it.<a name=160:24></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, assuming that there is such a thing as truth (and there must be, or there is nothing; for if there is something, a true statement or knowledge of what it is, is the truth), either man is omniscient, or he wants the truth to be made known to him.<a name=160:25></a> If he does, he needs evidences, unless he be so absolutely proper for its reception, that to state it is sufficient for its reception (i.<a name=160:26></a>e.<a name=160:27></a>, unless the truth be self-evident).<a name=160:28></a> If he be not so receptive of truth (and we are sure he is not), he needs evidences of it, because he has reluctance or difficulties.<a name=160:29></a>

		Now, in chapter 40, 48, though in the first comforts and promises Christ be named as the servant of Jehovah after the glory of Jehovah has been insisted on, yet when the prophet speaks of restoring Israel, and turns to their moral condition before it, they are looked at as the responsible servant of Jehovah, and His witnesses as the one only true God.<a name=192:2></a> "Ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, and my servants whom I have chosen.<a name=192:3></a>" But Israel had been weary of Him, yet He would restore and bless them, and idolatry and Babylon would be judged.<a name=192:4></a>

		The real objection to Daniel is, that prophecies and visions are impossible.<a name=209:4></a> Thus De Wette.<a name=209:5></a> It appears that Daniel is not the author of this book "from its legendary contents.<a name=209:6></a> It is full of improbabilities.<a name=209:7></a>" "The events of a distant future .<a name=209:8></a>.<a name=209:9></a>.<a name=209:10></a> are related with great distinctness and accuracy, even with the addition of the dates.<a name=209:11></a> This was evidently done after the events.<a name=209:12></a>" Now it is perfectly evident that this is no argument.<a name=209:13></a> It is simply saying, as we have seen before, there can be no prophet, no revelation; therefore Daniel is not one, and this is not a revelation, but composed after the event!<a name=209:14></a> This can have no force; it is a mere <i>petitio principii</i>, a begging the question.<a name=209:15></a> But a statement is made connected with it, and repeated by all the rationalists, that the alleged prophet stops at Antiochus Epiphanes.<a name=209:16></a> This is simply false.<a name=209:17></a> He continues (after a most important reference to the state of the Jews, and a most accurate one from the time of the Maccabees) a very detailed account of the state of Palestine in connection with the kings of north and south on to the end, where Daniel was to stand in his lot at the end of days.<a name=209:18></a> You have only to read Daniel 11: 30 to end, and 12 to convince you of it.<a name=209:19></a> If their theory be true, Daniel must write the book when he stands in his lot; and the details are quite as full at the end, if not more so, than in the previous part.<a name=209:20></a> This is all entirely unfounded.<a name=209:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Along with this, there is an effort to make the account of the empires suit the fact of Daniel living in Antiochus Epiphanes' time.<a name=209:22></a> If so, he could not speak of the Romans, and his four monarchies must end with the Grecian.<a name=209:23></a> Thus with Bunsen, the lion is Assyrian, the bear Babylonian, the leopard Persian, the fourth beast Alexander.<a name=209:24></a> Now this is too bad.<a name=209:25></a> Not a trace of Nineveh existed even when the true Daniel was in Babylon, and it was wholly inconsistent, if a patriot forgery, to place him there.<a name=209:26></a> Nineveh had not taken Judah captive; the thought is contrary to all probability; but he did see the wings of Babylon plucked, and a tame heart given it.<a name=209:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The attempt to make the last beast Alexander -- that is, the beast with seven heads and ten horns -- is arbitrary and without the smallest apparent ground.<a name=209:28></a> It is simply impossible that Daniel could so describe the Grecian empire, if he lived in the time of Antiochus.<a name=209:29></a> Alexander's empire had never seven heads and ten horns.<a name=209:30></a> It had four, as the leopard is spoken of here; and more precisely (as in the following chapter is expressly said of the Grecian kingdom)

	<div class="paragraph">
		All these statements are unworthy, I must say, of honest men.<a name=210:3></a> The previous attempt was to make Media one empire and Persia another, and so end with Alexander.<a name=210:4></a> This broke down because the prophet declares he reckons them one.<a name=210:5></a> "The ram with two horns are the kings of Media and Persia.<a name=210:6></a>" What was to be done?<a name=210:7></a> Baron Bunsen's imagination sets at work, and the Assyrian empire is dragged in before.<a name=210:8></a> But this is going farther and faring worse; because, besides the utter improbability already noticed, here are clearly only four great empires contemplated, and we have another figure of them -- the statue, where the head of gold is Nebuchadnezzar; and we find the ten kings in another form in the ten toes.<a name=210:9></a> They are really to be pitied in their reasonings; their object cannot here be alleged to be truth, but at all cost to prove Daniel is no prophet -- that there can be no revelation.<a name=210:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>W</i>.<a name=210:11></a> Well, it is pitiable and pitiful, because there is no honest nobleness of truth in it.<a name=210:12></a> No one can read Daniel, be he true or false, and not see that the Babylonish empire is the starting point in his mind.<a name=210:13></a> The rest follows necessarily.<a name=210:14></a> Have they no other grounds?<a name=210:15></a>

		Besides, chapter 9 ("Messiah is to be cut off and to have nothing," for this is the force of it) is clearly a prophecy.<a name=210:20></a> How they make this apply to the time of Antiochus Epiphanes I am at a loss to understand.<a name=210:21></a> It was poor patriotic encouragement to tell them that their Messiah, their Prince, would be there in a year and three months, be cut off, and get nothing, and then war and desolations.<a name=210:22></a> And the date is the decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem.<a name=210:23></a> De Wette says Daniel extends Jeremiah's seventy years to seventy weeks of years, so as to include Antiochus Epiphanes.<a name=210:24></a> But he admits the golden head and first beast are the Babylonian empire.<a name=210:25></a> Now, "include Antiochus Epiphanes" is rather vague.<a name=210:26></a> If we take the decree of Cyrus, which is very unlikely, it runs on to <i>one hundred and twenty years</i> beyond Antiochus Epiphanes, and, remark, beyond the existence of the Syrian monarchy.<a name=210:27></a> Cyrus took Babylon in 538 (Fynes Clinton).<a name=210:28></a> The

	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>H</i>.<a name=211:25></a> There are Greek words used for instruments of music.<a name=211:26></a> As to this, De Wette himself admits that it is possible that Greek instruments with these names may have been known to the Babylonians at this time.<a name=211:27></a> But a fuller enquiry into and deeper knowledge of languages, of which recent study has made almost a new science, has shewn that, not only does this attempt to impeach the genuineness of Daniel, from the use of Greek words, wholly fail, but the facts go to prove the genuineness.<a name=211:28></a> At the utmost, two names of instruments (which, if they came from Greece, would naturally keep their names) can be traced to Greek words.<a name=211:29></a> The others belong to that class of languages from which Greek proceeds -- the Aryan, or Indo-European, known now through Sanscrit and Zend.<a name=211:30></a> These words belonged to the East, and, save one, are not found where Greek and Aramaean were thrown together in the time of Antiochus Epiphanes.<a name=211:31></a> The foreign words are, many of them, inexplicable from Greek, but

		are explicable from the sacred language of the Aryans, who were the priestly caste in Babylon, and under Cyrus.<a name=212:1></a> As I have said, when Aramaean was Hellenized, these words disappeared.<a name=212:2></a> The force of this is evident.<a name=212:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is alleged, too, that the Chaldee and Hebrew are corrupt -- so say De Wette and Dr.<a name=212:4></a> Williams.<a name=212:5></a> I consult other authorities, and find the character of the Hebrew bears the closest affinity to that of Ezekiel and Habakkuk, who lived near his time; but it is less marked by peculiar corruptions than that of Ezra.<a name=212:6></a> The Aramaean also, like that of Ezra, is also of an earlier form than exists in any other Chaldaic document.<a name=212:7></a> Michaelis declares that the language proves it was no late compilation.<a name=212:8></a> Other words betray a source which renders it inexplicable how it could have been composed in Palestine.<a name=212:9></a> And the peculiarities urged as proofs of the late composition of Daniel are, by Havernick, on very strong grounds, shewn to be Babylonish peculiarities.<a name=212:10></a> Thus, like the alleged Greek, they too prove the genuineness of Daniel, which they were produced to impeach.<a name=212:11></a>

		Only a few isolated passages remain, which I notice because they refer to scripture.<a name=217:23></a> "The verse, 'And no man hath ascended up to heaven, save he that came down,' is intelligible as a free comment near the end of the first century, but has no meaning in our Lord's mouth at a time when the ascension had not been <a name=218>[Page 218]</a>

		As to faith being differently used in the Hebrews, it is a common stalking-horse of rationalists.<a name=218:14></a> It is not, they say, Paul's Epistle: faith is used differently.<a name=218:15></a> No Christian is held to believe it Paul's as it is not said so in the Epistle.<a name=218:16></a> I believe it is, but I am no way anxious or inclined to be dogmatic about it.<a name=218:17></a> I should be content to say with Origen, "Whose it is God knows," only assured that it is divine.<a name=218:18></a> Every one knows that very early, not two hundred years after Christ, it was doubted if it was Paul's (when fully received as scripture), because of the difference of style, and avowedly for this reason.<a name=218:19></a> But as to faith.<a name=218:20></a> It is differently applied, but does not mean a different thing.<a name=218:21></a> It is here looked at as an active principle of endurance and conduct, not as the ground on which we are justified.<a name=218:22></a> Both are true: that is all.<a name=218:23></a> A different subject is treated, and faith is shewn to be the principle of blessing in both; but in both it is the reliance through grace on God's

		As to Second Peter, the epistle most contested and latest known in the Church, I am thoroughly satisfied it is genuine.<a name=219:3></a> External evidence is not "against," but there is not so early evidence of quotation for it: that internal is, I formally deny.<a name=219:4></a> That mere critics who look at the surface have thought so I know.<a name=219:5></a> The similarity to Jude is dwelt on.<a name=219:6></a> There is an exactly suited difference.<a name=219:7></a> Jude speaks of apostasy; Peter of wickedness, because Peter speaks in both epistles of God's government, and gives the link between the glorious grace of the heaven-revealing gospel, and that government on earth as revealed already in the Old Testament: in the first epistle, viewed as exercised in favour of the just; in the second, against the wicked.<a name=219:8></a> Hence, he goes on to the end of all things.<a name=219:9></a> It professes to be the second epistle, and written by Simon Peter, saying, that he had been with Jesus in the transfiguration (and if thus an imposture, it is an audacious one; yet one which is most solemn in its denunciation of evil, and holy in its character).<a name=219:10></a> It properly and exactly completes the first.<a name=219:11></a> The question of the canon I need not go into with you, nor general councils.<a name=219:12></a> They do not in themselves command much respect when we read their history.<a name=219:13></a> There was what the rationalists, however, ought to delight in -- abundance of the human element.<a name=219:14></a> But I do not feel much more respect for the "first freedom of the gospel.<a name=219:15></a>" What we have of the fathers here alluded to was mere Alexandrian speculation -- after the school whose views are presented to us by Philo -- Neoplatonism!<a name=219:16></a> But we can bless God, that (in spite of shameful human violence and intrigue, and the emperor's authority to keep the peace amongst the bishops of the holy councils -- for this is the real truth of the case) God, who promised that the gates of hell should not prevail against the Church, has maintained substantial foundation truth for saints to live by, through the means of, or in spite of, human aberrations.<a name=219:17></a> The early contentions of the Church, and the deplorable scenes of the first councils, are full of instruction in this respect.<a name=219:18></a>

		The love of heathenism, formed into popery, of anythingism except a revelation, is curiously shewn in a passage in this part of the Review: -- "The elasticity with which Christianity gathers into itself the elements of natural piety, and assimilates the relics of Gentile form and usage, can only be a ground of objection (objection to what?<a name=221:5></a>) with those who have reflected little on the nature of revelation.<a name=221:6></a>" The fact is true.<a name=221:7></a> Mediaevalism is -- historical proof of it is abundant -- the assimilation of the relics of heathenism.<a name=221:8></a> Whether it is to be objected to is another question.<a name=221:9></a> I should, I confess, prefer Christianity as Christ and the apostles gave it.<a name=221:10></a> But the tendency of rationalism to accept popery, be assured, will daily be more evident.<a name=221:11></a> Pretending to be above it, it will leave it free to do all the mischief it likes.<a name=221:12></a> It is one of the ominous "forecasts" of the times of which I have no kind of moral doubt.<a name=221:13></a>

		<i>W</i>.<a name=223:1></a> Well, what do you say to Jowett?<a name=223:2></a> It has a different character from the other Essays.<a name=223:3></a> I cannot get so fast hold of it.<a name=223:4></a> The others rest on alleged facts or discoveries, which may alarm you if they can be maintained, and the deductions are just; but here there is nothing to lay hold of, and yet it leaves a painful impression on the mind that, if this be so, one has lost the word of God.<a name=223:5></a> It makes me not doubt of this or that, but doubtful of everything.<a name=223:6></a> I think it does me more harm than the others, if I am to have faith in God's word.<a name=223:7></a> I may say to myself, in reading the others, Well, this is all very well, but it rests on science or chronology, and people differ about that, and perhaps their statements will not stand examination; and there one leaves it.<a name=223:8></a> But here there are some sensible rules for interpretation; and yet, in interpreting, I have at the end lost the thing to be interpreted.<a name=223:9></a>

		<i>H</i>.<a name=223:10></a> I quite agree with you.<a name=223:11></a> There is greater sobriety of manner, a more moderate tone: Christ seems at least to be treated with more reverence.<a name=223:12></a> There are many principles which I should not deny, provided other principles which are not here were associated with them.<a name=223:13></a> He circles round the outside of the word, may make some just and more plausible remarks to remove traditional apprehensions.<a name=223:14></a> These approve themselves to the mind; but when he touches the core, the substance of the word, it is simply that God is not there for him.<a name=223:15></a> It is infidelity as to any possessed revelation of God, and the same taking for granted that all rationalist objections are gospel, if the evangelists were not, and the same entire ignorance really of the heart and substance of scripture.<a name=223:16></a> You must always remember that with this class of persons the love of truth does not mean that there is any truth they love, or any to be loved, but simple pyrrhonism -- the keeping the mind always open to receive anything, and therefore always sure of nothing.<a name=223:17></a> Now this is not the love of truth.<a name=223:18></a> It is the love of making people doubt, and think there is no truth.<a name=223:19></a> Can you tell me one truth they have brought forward in their writings?<a name=223:20></a> Isaiah is not Isaiah, David is not David, the inspired word is not inspired.<a name=223:21></a> What is it?<a name=223:22></a> Mere expressions of men's feelings and minds.<a name=223:23></a> Why, if that is all, I may get Dr.<a name=223:24></a> Temple's renewal of inspiration, and have or give just as good now; perhaps, as the world is got so much wiser now, better still.<a name=223:25></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have looked at Mr.<a name=224:13></a> Jowett's commentaries too.<a name=224:14></a> I confess I was surprised at their emptiness, and, I must say, their perverseness: notes to take away the apostles meaning, as received by faith in the word -- not merely false interpretations, or wrong construction of Greek, or traditional notions, but all divine points and truth gone, and that is all.<a name=224:15></a>

		They suggest to you probable or possible human circumstances which may have occasioned what is said, but deny, or, more truly, ignore all springs of eternal divine truth as the true source of the writings.<a name=224:16></a> It is -- though the comparison is weak -- as if one should point out circumstances in the life of a man of uncommon nobleness and energy and truth and generosity of character -- circumstances in which his character had been developed, some of them possibly having as occasions done so, and attribute all to these circumstances, as if the character were caused by them.<a name=224:17></a> In such a case I should say of one who did so, That man does not know what the springs of truth and nobleness and generosity are.<a name=224:18></a> Circumstances may develop: he may think he is wise; but the spring is wanting in him which would enable him to <i>understand</i> the other, even supposing he was owned to be superior.<a name=224:19></a> The similarity of moral sentiment is wanting.<a name=224:20></a> So, when scripture is interpreted by these men, some of their remarks as to occasions, or the effect of circumstances, may be just; but, in thinking they have explained the matter, they shew they have nothing of the contents <i>at all</i>.<a name=224:21></a> As if a man should eat the hard skin of a pomegranate, and think he had tasted one, telling me that it was through that the pomegranate was ripened.<a name=224:22></a> Well, so it was in a sense; but he has not tasted the pomegranate for all that, nor does he know what the sun is either.<a name=224:23></a>

		Now my object is not, of course, to explain here all prophecy, but to note that there was a reference to a great scheme or plan, such as must be in God's mind, though He may encourage and comfort at the time; and not only so, but that there was something more specific -- a giving up Israel, the beloved people, for a time (during which God would be found of them that sought Him not); that that, whatever other sins they had, was caused by their rejection of Jehovah coming as a man in mercy; that this caused their divorce from Him; and that then a long undefined interval would elapse, and blessing afterward arrive, but introduced by judgments -- the Lord pleading with all flesh.<a name=252:5></a> This gives a uniform plan, declared in statements verified before our eyes in the state of the Jews consequent on Christ's coming.<a name=252:6></a> This necessarily threw on the application of scripture prophecy to the end, when alone the plans of God would have their decided and full result, evil be set aside, and the earth blessed under Messiah.<a name=252:7></a> This principle the New Testament confirms (Matthew 23: 39; Romans 11: 25, 26; and other passages).<a name=252:8></a>

		We find the Old testifying, in one entire passage, of One coming in grace and gentleness, and then judgment.<a name=252:9></a> The New quotes what relates to the grace, and stops short of the judgment.<a name=252:10></a> Thus, Luke 4: 19, from Isaiah 61: 1.<a name=252:11></a> So Matthew 21: 5, from Zechariah 9: 9.<a name=252:12></a> The New Testament leads us itself to the same point.<a name=252:13></a> Thus, Matthew 10: "Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel till the Son of man be come.<a name=252:14></a>" Now, He was there; but there was a presenting of Him to human responsibility, and bringing Him in in power.<a name=252:15></a> So the Lord personally tells them they should not see Him till they said, Blessed be He that cometh.<a name=252:16></a> Till then their house should be desolate.<a name=252:17></a> I refer to these to shew that scripture constantly refers to a divine accomplishment of a plan to be fulfilled, which seemed at first to fail -- a failure which was the occasion of bringing in the Church on quite different principles,

		Finally, I take up Daniel, and I find a declaration of a period appointed to Jerusalem for God to bring in righteousness and blessing -- the famous period of seventy weeks; but when this is entered on in detail, we have seven weeks of trial to build the city, then sixty-two weeks to Messiah the Prince, who is cut off and takes nothing (for that is the true sense of the words; not, "and not for Himself").<a name=253:4></a> Then comes a long undated period of war and desolation.<a name=253:5></a> And when is the promise of the preceding verses supposed by the prophecy to be fulfilled?<a name=253:6></a> It must come after the end of the war: till then there are desolations -- the city and sanctuary being destroyed already.<a name=253:7></a> It is put off for an unknown length of time, and the unfinished period of seventy weeks gets its conclusion at the end.<a name=253:8></a> This is the unequivocal structure of the prophecy.<a name=253:9></a> (Daniel never goes on to the blessing beyond the times of the Gentiles.<a name=253:10></a>) That is, the prophets suppose a rejection of Israel for a long period, the cutting off of Messiah, and afterwards the bringing in of full blessing through Him.<a name=253:11></a> I am not now saying they are real prophecies to be fulfilled; nor, as to this point, does it alter the case, absurd as the theory is, if Daniel wrote in the days of Antiochus Epiphanes.<a name=253:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		My assertion is, that the prophets have a scheme of this kind -- an appearing of grace, as Christianity expresses it, teaching us to wait for the appearing of the glory -- a putting off to a remote period of earthly blessing, introduced by Messiah and judgments, the accomplishment of these prophecies, and of the blessing of Israel; Messiah being rejected meanwhile by Israel, and Israel therefore given up.<a name=253:13></a> But, whatever particular warnings and consolations there may have been, this shews that, while addressed to these generations, and often occasioned by their circumstances, prophecy always looked out farther in its true scope.<a name=253:14></a> I am speaking of its plan, not of its accomplishment.<a name=253:15></a> He who would interpret it with that kind of simplicity which would leave this out, leaves all the clearly demonstrable intention of its author out, and this is a bad way of interpreting.<a name=253:16></a>

		It is remarkable, that, when the prophecy goes out of the geographical name by which it is identified, it uses language intelligible at the time, as far as shewing it was beyond the limits of their geographical designation (Isaiah 18), a land beyond the rivers of Cush (that is, the Euphrates and Nile).<a name=258:12></a> The prophet connects it with Israelitish ideas, but goes far away beyond, as he must, to fill up the picture of the last days.<a name=258:13></a> But I should go too much into detail if I pursued this farther.<a name=258:14></a>

		<i>W</i>.<a name=259:4></a> It is an important question, and is even more embarrassing as to the New than as to the Old; because the New pronounces on the Old.<a name=259:5></a> But I see plainly, as to the question of the inspiration of the Old Testament -- of the prophets at least (and, indeed, the Lord cites the whole volume), they must be inspired, or impostors giving as the Lord's words what were not so.<a name=259:6></a> But then the Lord's statements are insurmountable.<a name=259:7></a> "The scriptures cannot be broken," for instance; for He must have known it if they were impostors, yet cites them as true prophets, and declares they must be fulfilled, that they spoke of Him.<a name=259:8></a> But if the prophets were inspired, we have direct inspiration, and the mind of God as far as given to them.<a name=259:9></a> And this, and this only, is what we have to seek, and the only question is, as you say: Is Christianity founded on a less explicit revelation from God than Judaism?<a name=259:10></a> You cannot say it was founded on Christ, and this is sufficient; for He wrote nothing, and I do not know what He was, with any divine faith, if the writings of the New Testament were not inspired.<a name=259:11></a> I see the question is a most grave one; while it is of the utmost weight to see that the Old Testament is certainly inspired, because the fundamental question is settled, and the casting the New Testament out of the limits of inspired communications is a poor idea altogether then.<a name=259:12></a> To say that an imperfect revelation is inspired, a perfect one not, is somewhat hard to believe: still we must see from scripture itself.<a name=259:13></a>

		We will now turn to Mr.<a name=262:13></a> Jowett's statements as to inspiration.<a name=262:14></a> The greater part is utter fallacy, or fancies of men which are only to be left to their own worthlessness.<a name=262:15></a> He gives various views of inspiration as contradictory, in order to shew the uncertainty of men on the subject, when, in fact, all are compatible and true, so that there is no dilemma at all, unless what is said of the kind of inspiration of particular books.<a name=262:16></a> All this is throwing dust in people's eyes.<a name=262:17></a> What the upright soul wants to know when it takes up a Bible, is, I can trust this; I will sit down to know what God will say to me, what He has said, what His mind is.<a name=262:18></a> As to the manner of inspiration, he knows nothing about it.<a name=262:19></a> What he reads must be the word of God for him.<a name=262:20></a> He must trust it, bow to it as such, and looks for the aid of the Spirit which indited it.<a name=262:21></a> And the doctors in theology know no more about it than he does, nor can they; because they are not inspired, and can have no consciousness of the manner of the Spirit's action.<a name=262:22></a> The apostle could not explain it.<a name=262:23></a> Mr.<a name=262:24></a> Jowett says it is held by some that there is an inspiration of superintendence, and by others an inspiration of suggestion.<a name=262:25></a> Now I believe both fully.<a name=262:26></a> If the evangelists, as eye-witnesses, had facts to record which they remembered, the Spirit had only to take care they were rightly used, Himself so to use the memory, and not permit the narrator to narrate them otherwise than according to His mind.<a name=262:27></a> There is an inspiration of suggestion, as the history of creation or prophecy.<a name=262:28></a> And Christ expressly promises both: "The Spirit of truth will guide you into all truth; for he shall not speak of himself, but what he shall hear that shall he speak, and he will shew you things to come.<a name=262:29></a>" And again:

		"He shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance.<a name=263:1></a>" Of course the Essayists know better about it than the scriptures.<a name=263:2></a> But Mr.<a name=263:3></a> Jowett tells us we are to take scripture's account of itself.<a name=263:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next we have opposed an inspiration in which the inspired person is passive, and an inspiration which acts through the character of the sacred writer.<a name=263:5></a> But here there is no opposition.<a name=263:6></a> If God has formed the character as a vessel, He can use it so that the will should be in no exercise, and what sets the character in activity should be simply the Holy Ghost moving it, and it remaining as an instrument what it was, as I have no doubt was usually the case.<a name=263:7></a> There are different kinds of inspiration as to form recognized in scripture, closely connected with this remark.<a name=263:8></a> I may speak the words willed by God, and not understand them, or I may understand and speak them.<a name=263:9></a> This last, though a less apparently inspired and glorious form, the apostle prefers.<a name=263:10></a> But both were inspired.<a name=263:11></a> An example of one was tongues, or Old Testament prophecy; the other was prophecy under the New.<a name=263:12></a> So when the communication of the facts and ordinary knowledge of facts are contrasted, the contrast has no ground.<a name=263:13></a> The Spirit brought to their remembrance.<a name=263:14></a> It was the memory of things known when they had taken place, but recalled in the perfection proper to the mind of God to the memory of the inspired person, or, if needed, revealed if unknown.<a name=263:15></a> What I look for in inspiration is, that the words should be so ordered by the Spirit as to convey perfectly what it was the intention of the Spirit to communicate.<a name=263:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, when an apostle spoke he was as inspired, when it was the intention of God he should be so, in speaking as in writing.<a name=263:17></a> When not, he was like another man speaking or writing -- perhaps more spiritual -- not <i>necessarily</i> so; but his words had no <i>inspired</i> authority.<a name=263:18></a> The writing was different in this -- it was to abide, and hence had a permanent character of inspiration.<a name=263:19></a> Although, as to this also, Paul might have written uninspired, though spiritual letters, or not inspired for permanent use.<a name=263:20></a> But I shall shew that the apostles do pretend to inspiration, and affirm it of all scriptures; that they distinguish between personal spirituality and inspired communications having the authority of the Lord.<a name=263:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		After making all kinds of false logical divisions and confusions, so as to puzzle the reader, Mr.<a name=263:22></a> Jowett comes plainly to the point, and asserts -- "Nor for any of the higher or supernatural views of inspiration is there any foundation in the gospels and epistles.<a name=263:23></a>" Now this is simply, totally, and entirely false -- an incredible

	<div class="paragraph">
		But as to the gospels, Mr.<a name=265:5></a> Jowett pleads that their declaring the record to be true, inasmuch as the writer saw that of which he spoke, is a proof that there is no inspiration.<a name=265:6></a> This is a mistake; the Lord had said the Spirit should bear witness of what they could not see -- the heavenly glory of Christ; the disciples of His life, as they had been with Him; but for this last, that all might be according to the perfection of the Holy Spirit, He would bring to their remembrance what Christ had said.<a name=265:7></a> That is, the Holy Ghost reveals the heavenly glory of Christ and doctrine flowing from it, and calls to remembrance the earthly teaching of Christ, which they had already heard.<a name=265:8></a> The fitting the vessel in every way is no proof of the Lord's not using it Himself.<a name=265:9></a> When the Lord is tempted by Satan, He quotes the scriptures as absolute authority against him, and Satan can make no reply to it at all.<a name=265:10></a>

		Mr.<a name=269:10></a> Jowett speaks of a cycle of traditions, beyond which the tradition of the early fathers never travels, "though the world could not contain the books if all were written.<a name=269:11></a>" And in these short narratives we ought to estimate the "accumulative weight" of the discrepancies.<a name=269:12></a> So of prophecy how far "the details were minutely fulfilled.<a name=269:13></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the fact that the early fathers never travelled beyond these narratives proves this, that beyond a written revelation they knew nothing about the matter; that all knowledge of the life of Jesus was confined to a written revelation -- a very important point in its nature, as proving, at the least, that the positive revelation about it was from the first so absolutely owned, to the exclusion of all else, that every other tradition dropped into oblivion at once.<a name=269:14></a> A pretended oral tradition really falls to the ground.<a name=269:15></a> This alone was owned and trusted from the beginning.<a name=269:16></a> These alleged traditions had no place at all in what was known; and I think we may fairly say that this could not have been the case without the divine will and power.<a name=269:17></a> A divine account was to, and did, supersede all human accounts.<a name=269:18></a> There must have been such; and Papias tells us there were, and that his delight was to listen to eye-witnesses telling of them; yet none appear.<a name=269:19></a> The apocryphal gospels are not worth referring to.<a name=269:20></a> The gospels were written apart from one another, probably at different epochs, yet with

		I would arrest your attention a moment on another passage here, as very deeply characteristic of the low ground on which all these reasonings rest.<a name=282:13></a> Mr.<a name=282:14></a> Jowett complains of the "extraordinary and unreasonable importance attached to single words .<a name=282:15></a>.<a name=282:16></a>.<a name=282:17></a> divorce, marriage with a wife's sister, inspiration, the personality of the Holy Spirit, infant baptism, episcopacy, divine right of kings, original sin.<a name=282:18></a> Now really a person must have been in a very singular school to give such a list.<a name=282:19></a> Lightness in divorce is an abomination in the sight of God; and in my judgment marriage with a wife's sister is the destruction of the free happiness of families.<a name=282:20></a> Episcopacy and infant baptism have their importance through their connection with more general truths.<a name=282:21></a> Kings have a divine right as long as God keeps them on the throne; that is, they have, however they get there, their power from God.<a name=282:22></a> But to mix up these subjects with inspiration, the personality of the Holy Ghost, and original sin, shews an absence of the spiritual element truly remarkable.<a name=282:23></a> If there be no inspiration, I have no communication from God -- the greatest privilege I can have on earth -- the only thing that puts me, in a sure and divine way, in relationship and intercourse with God.<a name=282:24></a> The personality of the Spirit is perhaps the most practically important truth, the most characteristic of Christianity, not as foundation, but, as to state and power, of all in scripture; and original sin, whatever view we may have of it, the foundation question of all man's relationship with God.<a name=282:25></a> And these Mr.<a name=282:26></a> Jowett casts in with episcopacy, and questions, serious no doubt in detail, but some of mere forms of

		Now John 14, 15, 16 are specially occupied with the truth of the Comforter's coming when Christ went away.<a name=286:13></a> It is after unfolding what Christ was in the world, to the end of chapter 7, and the rejection of His word in chapter 8, and of His work in chapter 1; the witness given to His being Son of God, Son of David, Son of man, in chapters 11, 12, and the washer of His people's feet whom He had cleansed, that they might have a part with Him on high, in chapter 13 (the great subject which follows on His going away).<a name=286:14></a> After declaring, in the beginning of chapter 14, that there was place for them on high, and He would come again and fetch them there; that they knew where He was going -- for He was going to the Father; and they had seen the Father in Him, and they knew the way, for in coming to Him they came to the Father; He proceeds to tell them the great blessing of their position while He was away -- and this was His obtaining another Comforter, the Holy Ghost, whom <i>His Father</i> would send on His going away, and who would bring to their remembrance what He had said when living; and then, in chapter 15, whom <i>He</i> would send from the Father, so that He would bear witness as well as

		that, if it is a true history, the whole system of the tabernacle was made after a pattern, which the Epistle to the Hebrews largely and specifically declares to be a heavenly one, and the tabernacle a pattern of things in the heavens.<a name=307:1></a> But we have this even more specifically defined.<a name=307:2></a> The law was a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image.<a name=307:3></a> There were sacrifices: so Jesus was a sacrifice.<a name=307:4></a> But the Jewish were repeated, proving that sin was not for ever put away for him who came by them; Jesus was not repeated, because it was.<a name=307:5></a> There were many priests, because they died; for us but one, because He ever lives.<a name=307:6></a> There was a veil, and no one could go into the holiest; now the veil is rent, and we have boldness to enter.<a name=307:7></a> The high priest stood, because his work was never finished; Jesus is set down at the right hand of God, because His work is finished for ever, and so on.<a name=307:8></a> These were the outlines of this vast exhibition of God's ways to be a key, so to speak, near the eye.<a name=307:9></a> But neither Testament is simply to be explained by the other.<a name=307:10></a> In some points there is contrast, as law and gospel; in others analogies; in others common principles; in others prophetic announcements.<a name=307:11></a> The only point we learn to have been hidden was the assembly.<a name=307:12></a> This could not be revealed because it was based on the casting down of the middle wall of partition, and the Jewish system on its being strictly kept up.<a name=307:13></a>

		But if God be the Author of the sacred volume, it is monstrous to suppose there was not a preparatory leading on to the full revelation of God Himself, or that He revealed something which was wholly unconnected with and no way introductory to what followed.<a name=307:14></a> It was necessary to make distinct the difference between man's standing on the ground of his own responsibility, and grace -- between requiring, however justly, and giving.<a name=307:15></a> And this, though prophets point to the giving, there is.<a name=307:16></a> But promises came before law; and even under law (a ministration of condemnation and death) there were ordinances which prefigured the way of grace, while the exacting of righteousness, which man had not, led him to the sense of the need which grace met.<a name=307:17></a> The understanding of all this rests on this: "They shall be all taught of God.<a name=307:18></a>" Each part, as to its statements, is to be understood in itself; but, when simply understood, the correspondences and differences will appear, and rich instruction for man's soul be acquired out of them.<a name=307:19></a>

		There is another interesting question which he touches on -- the origin of the first three gospels; but his conclusions -- for he is one of the most illogical persons I ever met with -- are in no way the consequence of his premisses.<a name=308:8></a> He is constantly making a false division, and the true conclusion is outside all he says.<a name=308:9></a> There is a difficulty as to the forms of recital of the first three or synoptical gospels.<a name=308:10></a> Marsh, who was educated in Germany, introduced into this country a modification of Eichhorn's German theories.<a name=308:11></a> Eichhorn afterwards changed his somewhat in consequence, if I remember right.<a name=308:12></a> The singular fact is, that tantamount statements are found in these gospels, often verbally the same, and yet sometimes different, and the facts placed in different connection.<a name=308:13></a> The only difficulty, and that which all are really <i>entirely ignorant of, is</i>, how to account for it.<a name=308:14></a> It affords no difficulty in reading, but great help.<a name=308:15></a> The difficulty is, for critics, simply how it should have happened.<a name=308:16></a> Mr.<a name=308:17></a> Jowett supposes the main facts were preserved orally.<a name=308:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, till the gospels were written, that seems to me a matter of fact, not "a probable solution," whatever use we may make of the fact.<a name=308:19></a> Only we have to remember that Christ told the apostles they should be witnesses, because they had been with Him from the beginning.<a name=308:20></a> That they were kept, according to the promise, to bring all things to their remembrance, as Jesus had said, I believe; and that they were graciously secured in their memory and use of facts; still they spoke of what they had seen.<a name=308:21></a> But this, while very simple, does not at all account for the phenomena, because one evangelist, even an apostle, recounts facts where he was <i>not</i> present, and another who <i>was</i> present does not recount them -- as Matthew and John as to what passed in the garden of Gethsemane.<a name=308:22></a> The motive of the histories, and these had had their source in some motive, is not in the casualty of memory, nor in the documents possessed.<a name=308:23></a> The theory is, the writers had the <i>same</i> tradition to use.<a name=308:24></a> Now if there were no governing motive, which gave a form to the gospels, writers would have put the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But as to the question raised, the facts of the case prove the contrary to what is pretended.<a name=309:9></a> If all the evangelists simply used a common tradition, how comes it that the connection, order, and development of facts are so different, if there was not in each (as inspired, I believe) independent design?<a name=309:10></a> Men have a common tradition (it is only true of a part), and yet produce very different books.<a name=309:11></a> They are not memoranda thrown together unconnected, but a set of facts used in a definite, but diverse connection, so as to produce a different picture altogether of the Saviour's life, and large portions wholly omitted, and large portions introduced, all in connection with this design.<a name=309:12></a> Yet, all together, they make up the full character of the Saviour seen on earth.<a name=309:13></a> It is declared, moreover, that there was a mass of other facts which they do not record, because these suit the purposes.<a name=309:14></a>

		Let me, before I enter on this, a little notice Mr.<a name=309:16></a> Jowett's conclusions from the statement I have quoted above: -- (1.<a name=309:17></a>) There is no necessity to reconcile inconsistent narratives -- the harmony of the gospels only means the parallelism of words.<a name=309:18></a> Now I object totally to all harmonies, as such; but the remark is unfounded.<a name=309:19></a> A certain number of passages are parallel in words; but, as to a vast quantity of the materials, it is not the case.<a name=309:20></a> A harmony is merely an attempt at chronological order.<a name=309:21></a>

		In chapter 14 He unfolds His disciples position in consequence.<a name=316:2></a> He was not going to be alone on high, He was going to prepare a place for them; but, having revealed the Father in Himself, they knew where He was going, for He was going to the Father, and they had seen Him in Him; and they knew the way, for they had come to the Father in coming to Him.<a name=316:3></a> That was as already there; but on going away He would obtain another Comforter for them.<a name=316:4></a> In spirit He would come to them, manifest Himself to them, and the Father and Himself make Their abode with them.<a name=316:5></a> The path of obedience and responsibility on christian (not on Adam) ground is in this and the following chapter fully set out.<a name=316:6></a> He left what He could only give in leaving -- for He made it by the cross -- peace; He gave them His own peace; but He was truly a man, cared for their love; if they loved Elim, they would be glad He was going to His Father, to rest and glory.<a name=316:7></a>

		In chapter 23 however He recognizes the seat of Moses still, and His disciples connection with it, owning still existing Judaism; but then judges in the severest way its state, declaring that their last hypocritical excuse would be taken away from them; that prophets and scribes (so He calls the gospel witnesses here, as in connection with the people) would be sent to them, and thus the measure of their guilt be filled up, and their house be left desolate till the last days, when the nation would own Him that came in the name of Jehovah.<a name=328:13></a>

		If we turn to christian missions, the truth is equally given up.<a name=354:8></a> "You may take the purer light or element of religion, of which Christianity is the expression, and make it shine on some principle in human nature, which is the fallen image of it.<a name=354:9></a> You cannot give a people, who have no history of their own, a sense of the importance of Christianity as an historical fact.<a name=354:10></a>" The fact of the incarnation of the eternal Son of God coming into the world is to be dropped.<a name=354:11></a> "We want to awaken in them the sense that God is their Father, and they His children; and that is of more importance than anything about the inspiration of scripture.<a name=354:12></a> But to teach in this spirit, the missionary should himself be able to separate the accidents from the essence of religion; he should be conscious that the power of the gospel resides, not in the particulars of theology, but in the christian life.<a name=354:13></a>" So it was all a mistake to say the <i>truth</i> shall make you free.<a name=354:14></a>

		REMARKS ON RATIONALIST VIEWS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I send you a few remarks on modern rationalist views and their bearing on Christianity (just as I penned them down for myself), that Christians may not lightly suffer the taint of such views to approach them; whatever may be their patience with those who may be deceived.<a name=360:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust.<a name=360:2></a> For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me.<a name=360:3></a> But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?<a name=360:4></a>" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#5:45">John  5:45</a>-47.<a name=360:5></a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here we have more than one point.<a name=360:6></a> First, Moses writings are attributed to him; next, it is declared that he wrote of Christ, of Jesus; thirdly, his writings are spoken of, and, because they are <i>writings</i>, as of authority superior, as far as form goes, to Christ's <i>words</i>.<a name=360:7></a> If, therefore, we do not receive his writings, Christ's words have no authority -- Christ made a mistake as to his writing of Him -- His whole interpretation of scripture is unfounded -- His estimate of Himself is false as the object of this testimony.<a name=360:8></a> Who can guarantee its being well-founded on any other ground?<a name=360:9></a> He supposed God's mind was in the written word; the modern doctrine makes this a mistake -- He was not the object of Moses writings -- nor did Moses write them!<a name=360:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Who can tell then that there was a Christ to come?<a name=360:11></a> or if Jesus was not the subject of this testimony, He was, if there was any such testimony, deceived as to Himself.<a name=360:12></a> The whole authority of Christ and His words is gone -- as to God's mind and as to Himself.<a name=360:13></a> Christianity and Christ Himself are without foundation.<a name=360:14></a> For if Christ's own testimony is unfounded and Moses too as to Him -- or rather, if there is none such, as Christ supposed there was -- what foundation have I for anything in Christianity as a revelation of the mind of God and of His Son as the truth?<a name=360:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again He says, on the most solemn occasion as to the repentance or ruin of the Jews: "They have Moses and the prophets, let them hear them.<a name=360:16></a>" All this was misleading -- they were not authentic.<a name=360:17></a> But further, if they are not heard, Christ declared His resurrection has no force to persuade.<a name=360:18></a> If they hear not Moses

		and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded if one rose from the dead.<a name=361:1></a> But all this was a blunder.<a name=361:2></a> There was no real power in Moses and the prophets.<a name=361:3></a> Christ made a mistake.<a name=361:4></a> Whatever His resurrection might do, Moses writings were a forgery and had no authority whatever; so that there was no adequate ground to be persuaded by the resurrection itself.<a name=361:5></a> This was all Christ's solemn attestation was worth.<a name=361:6></a> Yet here the Lord was taking them out of the whole system of Jewish legalism.<a name=361:7></a> The event proved the truth of His words.<a name=361:8></a> They did not believe, though one rose from the dead; but then, it was a mistake of the Lord from that to blame them for not receiving the testimony of Moses and the prophets, for they were of no value at all.<a name=361:9></a> It was not Moses at all.<a name=361:10></a>

		So, when He said, "Search [or, ye search] the scriptures .<a name=361:11></a>.<a name=361:12></a>.<a name=361:13></a> they are they which testify of me" -- the business, He declares, of the scripture was to testify of Him, Jesus, as the Christ.<a name=361:14></a> On whose part?<a name=361:15></a> Was it God's testimony, or the wild notions, previsions or interpretations of fanatics that Christ appealed to?<a name=361:16></a> What was the person testified to, or who appealed to their worth if they were?<a name=361:17></a> But if of God, "the scriptures" are so.<a name=361:18></a> We all know what that meant in a Jew's mouth.<a name=361:19></a>

		Again in Luke 24, "and beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself," What was He doing?<a name=361:20></a> And here no stupid blasphemous pretext about His having the prejudices of the Jews is of any avail.<a name=361:21></a> He was risen: I suppose He was freed from prejudices by that time.<a name=361:22></a> But what shall we say?<a name=361:23></a> It was not Moses; and the testimony of scripture was no really inspired prophetic testimony; consequently, not about Himself.<a name=361:24></a> The risen Lord misled, as much as when walking, before His death, on the earth.<a name=361:25></a> And Christians are to believe this!<a name=361:26></a> But He goes a step farther.<a name=361:27></a> He uses divine power over their minds as to it.<a name=361:28></a> "Then opened he their understandings, that they might understand the scriptures; and said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer" opened divinely their understanding to understand forgeries, or even, if you please, the rhapsodies of patriotic bards and pious compositions from old legends.<a name=361:29></a> Is not that singular?<a name=361:30></a> We have no truth as to Christ and what He did, if this be so; for what is ascribed to Him as risen and divinely operating on men's minds was never pressed in in respect of an imposture.<a name=361:31></a> The utmost foundation was an obscure legend, patched up into a false story, and He not only mistook, when

		Further, the Lord Himself quotes, as His reply to Satan, the scriptures with the emphatic declaration: "It is written.<a name=362:2></a>" And when even Satan sets about, consequently, to use scripture, He does not leave this ground, but says "it is written again.<a name=362:3></a>" Impossible to give a more striking testimony to where truth and power were to be found to baffle the enemy.<a name=362:4></a> He was led of the Spirit to this solemn conflict, that He might bind the strong man, and deliver men, spoiling his goods.<a name=362:5></a> But His victory was founded on a forged imposture, something that Jeremiah's fanaticism and Huldah and the chief priest's deceit got up to try and work a reformation: but in vain.<a name=362:6></a> So they tell us.<a name=362:7></a> I suppose the devil must have been a prejudiced Jew too, to let himself be silenced in this way!<a name=362:8></a> He was more blind and easily cheated than we are led to suppose.<a name=362:9></a>

		I have thus brought forward these repeated instances, as shewing that the whole structure of Christianity is based on the inspiration of the Old Testament scriptures, and on the truth that God's mind was intentionally expressed in them; and that Christ presented Himself, and the apostles presented Him, as the fulfilment on God's part of what God had said, that there might be a positive previous testimony.<a name=366:10></a> If this be not so, then the whole system falls.<a name=366:11></a> There was no such intention, no such prophecies, and no such fulfilment.<a name=366:12></a> Christ and His apostles mistook the whole matter -- and what are they?<a name=366:13></a>

		We shall find the epistles proceed upon the same foundation.<a name=366:14></a> It would be endless to quote from the Epistles to the Romans, the Hebrews and others -- all the scriptures quoted as conclusive authority, as being God's statements; and hence leaving no room for argument.<a name=366:15></a> But some passages as to the place given to scripture in the New Testament, and to those in the New Testament itself, it is of importance to quote definitely.<a name=366:16></a>

		In Romans 16: 26, the New Testament scriptures are thus referred to: "But now is made manifest and by prophetic scriptures [this is the literal and only literal translation], according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith.<a name=366:17></a>" I say the New Testament -- for the mystery is declared to have been kept secret since the world began, but to be made manifest now.<a name=366:18></a> There were things revealed before, as we have seen; but the doctrine of the Church, the breaking down of the middle wall of partition, the Gentiles being fellow-heirs and of one body, was hid in God (see Ephesians 3) and required a positive revelation, and a new one.<a name=366:19></a>

		"As it is written" is sufficient with Paul to bring in the whole world guilty.<a name=367:3></a> The great privilege of Israel was, that the oracles of God were committed to them; they were "oracles of God" for the apostle.<a name=367:4></a> In Exodus 33 "God spake to Moses," he tells us: and "the scripture saith to Pharaoh;" so "the scripture saith" suffices to set aside the whole Jewish system.<a name=367:5></a> (Romans 10.<a name=367:6></a>) Let the reader only take a concordance and see the use of "it is written," say in the single chapter of Romans 1 5; So in Galatians 3, "the scripture foreseeing that God would justify the heathen," thus giving the authority of God's own mind to scripture: and that to Moses's statements of God's revelations to Abraham.<a name=367:7></a>

		And note, as the foundation and character of Christianity itself, scripture concludes men under sin.<a name=367:8></a> What authority has it here?<a name=367:9></a> The law was our schoolmaster; nay, Christ submits to its prescribed curse -- and it is not authentic!<a name=367:10></a>

		Here is the apostle's account of his revelations.<a name=367:11></a> He knew the things by the Spirit; he spake them by words which the Holy Ghost taught, and they were received by the grace of the Spirit.<a name=367:12></a> Now I recognize freely here that this applies to preaching.<a name=367:13></a> I quote it to shew the direct assertion of revelation by the Spirit to him, and that his communications were in the words taught by the Spirit.<a name=367:14></a> But he can add, "If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord.<a name=367:15></a>"

		The well-known passage in 2 Timothy 3 gives us the clearest instruction on this point.<a name=367:16></a> It has peculiar emphasis, because the Church had already separated from godliness and order, and perilous times were to come, and evil men and seducers wax worse and worse.<a name=367:17></a> The saints needed a sure ground to go upon; a resting-place for their hearts somewhere.<a name=367:18></a> Besides personal confidence in Paul, which we have only in his writings, the apostle continues, "and that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith that is in Christ Jesus.<a name=367:19></a> All (every) scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for

		Now, remark here, that if I receive Christianity, I receive it as a revelation by divinely-inspired teachers.<a name=368:12></a> But these teachers (whatever credit they assume to themselves, both Christ and the apostles) refer me to the holy scriptures as divine authority, and quote them as absolutely conclusive, an authority by which they would be judged, and sufficient proof of their words; and refer to them as we have them, and in particular to Moses as the giver of the law.<a name=368:13></a>

		Note here, that the Epistle to the Hebrews never refers to the temple, which might be said to be then before them, but to the tabernacle, and the Mosaic account of it, and in chapter 11 quotes, I may say, the whole history of the Book of Genesis, and all the Pentateuch and Joshua, as the Lord used Deuteronomy against Satan.<a name=369:3></a>
