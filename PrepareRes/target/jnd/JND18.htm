		ADDRESS TO HIS ROMAN CATHOLIC BRETHREN BY A MINISTER OF THE GOSPEL
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Brethren -- The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ would ever make to whom it was given anxious to declare it to others.<a name=1:1></a> I have been deeply anxious concerning you from the day I came amongst you; and as I did not know how to leave the labour I was engaged in to turn to you, I cannot but see the hand of God in thus taking me from it for a while.<a name=1:2></a> I shall be glad to discharge in some measure my conscience towards you; but I desire to do much more, making known to you the riches and power of God's redeeming love.<a name=1:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You all know how carefully you have been kept and warned from intercourse with those who have been anxious to bring the word of God amongst you, and to shew you what the Spirit of God has taught us concerning the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=1:4></a> You are taught to look upon them as heretics, as if we were not in the right faith at all.<a name=1:5></a> I shall make no observation on these things, for the Spirit of the Lord Jesus has taught us in His word, and teaches the heart of every real disciple, that the true and only answer to these charges, and this prejudice which they put into your hearts against us is the exercise of unwearied patience and love towards you; and this is our duty, brethren; and I pray God to enable His servants ever thus to walk, that you may see the sincerity of our hearts towards you in love.<a name=1:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I shall now proceed to set before you those blessed truths of the gospel, which we hold as the refuge and salvation of our souls.<a name=1:7></a> If you refuse altogether to inquire into them, I beg of you only to consider on what ground you will justify yourself, if God shall call you in question for having despised His truth.<a name=1:8></a> Brethren, my heart's desire to God for you is, that you might know the peace and power of the gospel of Christ which is kept from you.<a name=1:9></a> No other enmity have I against those who keep you in darkness but this, that they deprive you of the gospel.<a name=1:10></a> Would to God they would hear it, and not be heaping up judgment for themselves against the day of wrath!<a name=1:11></a> Would to God they would!<a name=1:12></a> Gladly and thankfully would every zealous Christian see their work ended by those who exercise authority over you themselves ministering the gospel, joined in one mind with us in furthering the glory of the Saviour, and our common hopes; but while they will not, it is the bounden duty of every one to whom the grace of the gospel has been committed, so far as he is afforded opportunity, nay, to seek opportunity, to warn you earnestly that you are kept in darkness, and to hold up the gospel before you, that you may see the light.<a name=1:13></a> It is a work of unfeigned love, and I beseech you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to receive it so.<a name=1:14></a>

		I join with my whole heart those who urge the reading of the scriptures; and I do not conceal from you, that I judge it the manifest work of Satan to keep them from you, and the proof of the power of Antichrist; and all the history of the church shews me this.<a name=2:1></a> But I shall not enter on this now.<a name=2:2></a> I shall first plainly state the blessed gospel, in the hope that, by the blessing of God, its glory and its grace may reach some soul; and that, if any amongst you be mourning over their sin, they may find the perfect comfort it was meant to give; and I shall then shew you, that that in which the priests make their boast over us is an invention only tending to rob Christ of His glory, and you of your comfort, and, I must add, to keep you in sin and impenitence.<a name=2:3></a> Forgive me this, brethren.<a name=2:4></a> Would to God I had opportunity of simply stating the gospel to you, and you had ears to hear it with desire.<a name=2:5></a> Little need I then trouble you or myself with opposing what is contrary to it.<a name=2:6></a> But if your souls are endangered by it, is it anything but kindness to shew you your danger?<a name=2:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I say then, brethren, that the Lord Jesus, by the one sacrifice of Himself once offered, has totally and eternally put away sin, so that it shall never be imputed at all to those that believe on Him, and that every repentant sinner who comes to Him is justified from all things, is accepted of God in Christ, with all the love He bears towards the Lord Jesus, for whose sake He does so accept us; that the glorious love of Almighty God has provided this deliverance for sinners who could not help themselves.<a name=2:8></a> You can understand, my friends, what comfort it would give to a soul really burthened and distressed with sin, who would earnestly desire favour and acceptance with God, against whom he had offended, to find that God Himself had freely put it all away and blotted it out.<a name=2:9></a> And He has, if you will believe the Son of God and His Spirit speaking by the apostles -- He has so loved us <i>while we were sinners</i>, as to give "his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life"; so that, being justified by faith in Him, we should have peace with God, and rejoice in hope of His glory.<a name=2:10></a> And it is Satan's own work to deny this -- to say that God did not so love us -- that Christ's sacrifice was not sufficient to put away sin -- that His blood, through faith in it, does not cleanse from all sin.<a name=2:11></a> Brethren, what you want for your peace is to have your conscience cleansed from sin against God; and this the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ, once slain for us, alone can do -- and can do altogether.<a name=2:12></a> How much more, says the apostle, shall the blood of Christ, who by the Holy Ghost offered Himself unspotted unto God, cleanse our conscience from dead works to serve the living God, Hebrews 9: 14.<a name=2:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Brethren, I beseech you to lay this to heart.<a name=3:1></a> Has the Son of God left the glory of His Father, and given His life for you, and will you say, I will not accept your freely offered love, I will not believe that you have wrought a full and perfect salvation for me?<a name=3:2></a> And if you do not believe that Christ has altogether and perfectly justified you from your sin by His death, you deprive yourself of all the hope of the gospel.<a name=3:3></a> For if you are not at peace with God, you can never have the hope of His glory; and if you are not perfectly justified from sin, it is impossible you can be at peace with God; nay, more, you can never serve God here with a free and willing mind, which is the only acceptable service.<a name=3:4></a> For if you do not know but that God is still angry with you, if you are still afraid of Him, your service will be no real service, you will go on working in misery, in hope of gaining His favour.<a name=3:5></a> And this is what every sincere Roman Catholic is doing, adding work to work, in hope of turning away the anger of God, and gaining His favour; but this is all in vain, and really a great dishonour to God.<a name=3:6></a> God is love, and He has proved it by sending His Son to die for you, while you were in your sins.<a name=3:7></a> How freely, how devotedly, would you be able to serve God if you knew that He loved you, and had done such wonderful things for you, and that you were fully accepted!<a name=3:8></a> And He has, my friends, or we should all have perished eternally.<a name=3:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Oh!<a name=3:10></a> that you knew this; oh!<a name=3:11></a> that you would believe this, that you might know the comfort and the joy that there is in believing.<a name=3:12></a> And how is all this?<a name=3:13></a> By the sacrifice of Christ, the one great atonement for sin, the one glorious shewing forth of the love of God to sinners, so that there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, as Paul says, or as our Lord Himself says, "He who heareth my word, and believeth him that sent me, hath life everlasting, and cometh not into judgment, but is passed from death to life," John 5: 24.<a name=3:14></a>

		"By one oblation," says the Epistle to the Hebrews, "he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified," Hebrews 10: 14.<a name=4:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And what, on the denial of this, is promised instead, in which you boast yourselves?<a name=4:2></a> The pretended absolution of your priests and the sacrifice of the mass.<a name=4:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The effect of these is not to bring the conscience to God, that it might feel the depth of heart sin against Him, and seek for cleansing pardon and renewal of soul through the blood of the cross, and the power of the Spirit of God -- but by relieving your conscience at the moment from the fear it was under, to leave you at liberty to go on sinning again.<a name=4:4></a> But, my friends, need I solemnly warn you, do not your own consciences tell you, that this is an impious delusion?<a name=4:5></a> It takes away the fears of the wicked man, so as to let him go on in his sins, and leaves the poor humbled penitent with his conscience as burthened as ever; and because they are sincere in their sorrow for sin, some additional burthen of penance put upon them.<a name=4:6></a> Oh!<a name=4:7></a> is this like the grace of God, or the truth of His love?<a name=4:8></a> Brethren, if anything would rouse Christian indignation to what is called religion amongst you, it is to see the wicked thus let go free, and still more, the heaping sorrow upon a contrite heart, putting them off with penances, which in their sincerity they will rigidly fulfil, without one ray of that comfort which the blessed God delights to give the humble.<a name=4:9></a> "For thus saith the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy, I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.<a name=4:10></a>" But I tell the unrepenting sinners, they miserably deceive themselves, and they, and those that deceive them, shall find judgment for.<a name=4:11></a> their iniquity; and I tell the humbled and contrite in the Lord's name, Fear not, Christ has died for you, God Himself has justified you: there is free and perfect remission by the death of Him who was delivered for your offences.<a name=4:12></a> Nay, more, the same Jesus who died for you is now at the right hand of God, making intercession for you; able, as the apostle says, "to save them for ever that come to God by him, always living to make intercession for us.<a name=4:13></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		And this is another point where the great and tender love of God has been hid from you, I mean the mediation of Christ.<a name=5:1></a> You are led to look at Christ as a severe judge, or an unapproachable Lord, as if we had need of a mediator to come to Him by; but let the humble soul remember that He is, through the infinite grace of God and His own love, man as well as God.<a name=5:2></a> Did He not prove to us, that He was ready, nay, desirous to receive all that come to Him, by becoming one of ourselves, though without sin?<a name=5:3></a> For what did He pass through suffering and trial in the flesh, but to enter into all our sufferings with us, to understand them all, that they who believe might feel they had a friend who knew thoroughly all our wants and trials?<a name=5:4></a> or will they say He has left off to feel for those for whom He suffered so much, nay, whom He purchased at so costly a price?<a name=5:5></a> Brethren, I beseech your attention to this.<a name=5:6></a> The very glory of the gospel, the way in which it has pleased the Father to glorify Himself and His Son Jesus Christ, is by the Son's becoming mediator between God and man; and for this purpose, as the apostle speaks, He became man.<a name=5:7></a> He acquainted Himself with all the trials of those whom He redeemed to be His brethren, and whom He ever looks at as such, that He might succour them in all their difficulties; Hebrews 2: 11.<a name=5:8></a> The words of the apostle are these: "For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren"; and again, "Behold I and my children whom God hath given me.<a name=5:9></a>" "Therefore, because the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he himself also in like manner hath been partaker of the same, that through death he might destroy him who had the empire of death, that is to say, the devil.<a name=5:10></a> Wherefore it behoved him in all things to be made like unto his brethren, that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest before God, that He might be a propitiation for the sins of the people.<a name=5:11></a> For in that wherein he himself hath suffered and been tempted, he is able to succour them also that are tempted.<a name=5:12></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And it is not merely argument we have for these things: I quoted to you above, He was declared to be "always living to make intercession for us"; but the apostle is plainer still.<a name=5:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Having therefore a great high priest, that hath passed into the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession; for we have not a high priest who cannot have compassion on our infirmities, but one tempted in all things like as we are, without sin.<a name=5:14></a> Let us go therefore with confidence to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace in seasonable aid.<a name=5:15></a>" In short, brethren, what could our hearts desire more, than that One who so loved us as to give His life for us -- one who has a perfect sense and tender feeling for all our wants, by having felt them Himself -- should be now exercising that love for us at the right hand of the Father?<a name=5:16></a> And so John -- "But if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the just, and he is the propitiation for our sins.<a name=5:17></a>" Acquaint yourselves with the love and gracious tenderness of our glorified Lord.<a name=5:18></a> Taste and see that the Lord is gracious.<a name=5:19></a> Dishonour Him not in denying His willingness to receive you, as though He were a consuming fire; He is not except to those who deny Him.<a name=5:20></a><a href="#5:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> The Lord, who is the same yesterday, today, and for ever, has not changed in love since He said, "Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.<a name=5:21></a>" Open your hearts before Him, ye that seek for mercy; if He redeemed you when you were enemies by sin, how much more will He receive you now that He has reconciled you!<a name=5:22></a> But having gone on to say so much for the humble soul, I return to the sacrifice and priesthood.<a name=5:23></a>
	</div>

		Some, I know, totally to their.<a name=6:1></a> own confusion, deny that Christ has thus perfectly delivered the conscience of believers, by putting away sin for them by the sacrifice of Himself.<a name=6:2></a> But, perhaps, some of you will say, who denies it?<a name=6:3></a> I answer as to the comfort of your consciences, as to the faith of the soul in it, it is utterly denied to you; and your consciences in consequence kept in bondage.<a name=6:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ, the Spirit of God has declared, has put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself: if He has, what need of any other sacrifices?<a name=6:5></a> He hath made an end of sin, says Daniel, and brought in everlasting righteousness.<a name=6:6></a> But in your sacrifices there is a remembrance made of sin as not put away; for if Christ has reconciled us to God, and expiated sin for us, what is the repeated sacrifice for?<a name=6:7></a> Does it not directly and expressly take away from the glory of His sacrifice, and say it was not enough, that it was insufficient?<a name=6:8></a> And while it robs Christ of His glory, as if He had not reconciled us to God, it deprives us of our comfort by declaring His sacrifice insufficient to clear our consciences.<a name=6:9></a> And mark the utter folly of such a thought.<a name=6:10></a> As if the sacrifice which the Lord Jesus Christ offered Himself in the shedding of His blood by the eternal Spirit was insufficient to put away sin, or to cleanse our consciences by faith in it, but the sacrifice which men offer without blood does that which the former did not do!<a name=6:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Ah!<a name=7:1></a> brethren, why will you be kept from the faith of the Son of God once dying for us?<a name=7:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I further shew you, that it is contrary to express testimony of the Spirit of God: not merely as to the sacrifice, but as to their claim of being priests, and that both one and the other are in fact a denial of Christianity.<a name=7:3></a> In the Epistle to the Hebrews (chapter 7: 22) the Spirit of God thus testifies, "By so much is Jesus Christ made a surety of a better testament; and the others [referring to the Jewish priests] indeed were made many priests, because by reason of death they were not suffered to continue; but this [that is, Christ as a priest], for that he continueth for ever, hath an everlasting priesthood, whereby he is able also to save for ever them that come to God by Him, always living to make intercession for us, for it was fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens; who needeth not daily (as the other priests) to offer sacrifices, first for his own sins, and then for the people's; for this he did <i>once</i> in offering himself.<a name=7:4></a>" Now, brethren, if you feel any interest in how you may rightly come to God, if this be the express teaching of the Spirit of God, is not the claim of priesthood, and the offering of sacrifice, which is the proper office of a <i>priest</i> (Hebrews 5: 1), directly opposed to the truth of the gospel, and the mind of the Holy Ghost?<a name=7:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is fitting, that we Christians should have a High Priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, separate from sinners, made higher than the heavens, who needeth not daily to offer sacrifices, for this He did once in offering Himself.<a name=7:6></a> What room does this leave to one who believes in it, that accepts the mercies of God in His Son, set forth by the Holy Ghost, to look for constantly repeated sacrifices, and a multitude of priests on earth?<a name=7:7></a> For if that which the Holy Ghost declares to be fitting has been done, as it certainly has, there can be no truth in that which is contrary to it; and supporting the earthly priesthood and sacrifice is not only against the honour, but is really a denial, of the sacrifice and priesthood of the Lord Jesus our Saviour; which is the hope, the support, the comfort of every believer in Him, and the blessed earnest of their being with Him in glory, seeing, as the apostle speaks, Jesus, in entering into the heavens, has entered for us as a forerunner.<a name=7:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=8>[Page 8]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In a word, Jesus Christ is the Priest of the Christian church and its sacrifice; nor is there the least ground whatever given by God, for any man to assume the character of a priest, that is a sacrificer; and whoever does it, does it on his own authority and in opposition to God and His Christ.<a name=8:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The repetition of the sacrifice shews its total inefficiency to cleanse the conscience from sin.<a name=8:2></a> By this the apostle shews the inefficacy of the Jewish sacrifices, and afterwards asserts that to which I would earnestly entreat your attention, as the great centre of truth in this matter; I mean, the perfect remission of sins wrought for believers by the death of Christ.<a name=8:3></a> Speaking of the sacrifices under the law, he says (Hebrews 10: 1), "the law by the self-same sacrifice which they offer continually every year can never make the comers thereunto perfect, for then they would have ceased to be offered, because the worshippers once purged would have no conscience of sin any longer; but in them there is made a commemoration of sins every year"; and then verse 10, "In the which will" (that is, of God) "we are sanctified by the oblation of the body of Jesus Christ once.<a name=8:4></a>" And again, verse 12, "But this man offering one sacrifice for sins, for ever sitteth on the right hand of God.<a name=8:5></a>" And again verses 14-18, "For by one oblation He hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified; and the Holy Ghost doth also testify this to us; for after that He said, And this is the testament which I make unto them after those days, saith the Lord, I will give my laws in their hearts, and in their minds will I write them, and their sins and iniquities I will remember no more.<a name=8:6></a> Now, where there is remission of these, there is no more an oblation for sin.<a name=8:7></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So that, my friends, either there is not remission of sins by Jesus Christ, or there is no more oblation for sin; and if the Holy Ghost hath testified truly that there is remission of sins by Jesus Christ, and that the sins and iniquities of those within His testament are remembered no more, then the sacrifice which you pretend to offer for sin is false, and not merely a harmless error, but one amounting to a denial of the remission of sins by Jesus Christ, the preaching of which in His name was the great commission given to the apostles; Luke 24: 47.<a name=8:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=9>[Page 9]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I shall copy another passage without any observation.<a name=9:1></a> I speak as unto wise men; judge ye what is said.<a name=9:2></a> The apostle had said (Hebrews 9: 22), "Without shedding of blood is no remission of sins," and then (verse 24), "For Jesus is not entered into the holiest made with hands, the patterns of the true, but into heaven itself, that he may appear now in the presence of God for us.<a name=9:3></a> Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holies every year with the blood of others, for then he ought to have suffered often from the beginning of the world; but now once at the end of ages he hath appeared for the destruction of sin by the sacrifice of himself.<a name=9:4></a> And as it is appointed unto men once to die, and after this the judgment; so also Christ was offered once to exhaust the sins of many, the second time he shall appear without sin to them that expect him unto salvation.<a name=9:5></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In a word my friends (Romans 5: 19), "as by the disobedience of one man many were made sinners, so also by the obedience of one man many shall be made just.<a name=9:6></a>" And I solemnly warn you, in the name of Him who shall judge the quick and the dead, that if you are not partakers in the righteousness of Christ, you have no hope in you: all your works are vain delusions, unacceptable, nay, an abomination to God; they can give you no peace, nor have they any fruit unto life eternal, while you despise the work which God has Himself wrought in the gift of His own Son.<a name=9:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Brethren, brethren, my heart's desire would be to preach the gospel simply to you, and not touch -- why should I desire it?<a name=9:8></a> -- upon those things in which you are kept in error: my own hope and comfort, and, through the mercy of God, my joy too (blessed for ever be His holy name, who hath called me in His mercy to the faith of His Son), is in the knowledge of the perfect and gracious salvation wrought by Jesus Christ, so that all fear is taken from him that believes; and in the knowledge we are given of the glory of the Lord, of God our Saviour in it.<a name=9:9></a> Of this I earnestly desire that you may be partakers: we are all equally unworthy of it.<a name=9:10></a> It is free grace to all.<a name=9:11></a> The prayer of my soul is offered up to God for you, that through that grace you may be brought to the knowledge of salvation by faith in Christ Jesus.<a name=9:12></a> But, brethren, it is an awful time for you.<a name=9:13></a> Your errors in ignorance would be freely forgiven and put out of remembrance, if you repent and believe the gospel: but judgment comes upon those, who, when "light is come into the world, love darkness rather than light," John 3: 19.<a name=9:14></a> Read the whole chapter down to this.<a name=9:15></a> The fear of men will be no excuse in that day; for if you had thought rightly of God, you would rather have feared Him.<a name=9:16></a> I have anxiously, according to the grace given me, thought of the state you are in, and the testimony of the Spirit of God in His word concerning you, and I earnestly and solemnly entreat you to consider it in your own souls, to examine what real ground you have for hope of acceptance, which you know God sanctions; you will see you have none, and that the rejection of the gospel now declared to you is the rejection of your salvation.<a name=9:17></a>

		I am led to some of these remarks by the little book called "Reasons which Roman Catholics offer why they cannot conform to the Protestant religion.<a name=12:1></a>" I shall make some observations on these, in the hope that they may lead you to inquire diligently on what ground the hope of your souls rests.<a name=12:2></a> One reason given is the impossibility of the church of Christ erring from the true faith; and I know this weighs much with many sincere persons amongst you.<a name=12:3></a> Now brethren, I freely admit this; for rightly understood as to the true church, it is a self-evident truth; for this reason, that where there is no true faith, there could be no church, for the church thus understood is properly an assembly of believers, that is, of people that have a true faith.<a name=12:4></a> And I further freely admit, as the promise on which my souls rests, that from Christ's first coming in the flesh, till His second coming in His glory, there undoubtedly has been and will be such a company of believers; and this company of believers are all witnesses to the faith, and maintain in and to the world the profession of faith, and thus the honour of the Redeemer's name.<a name=12:5></a> And this is what Paul means by the church of God being the pillar and ground of the faith.<a name=12:6></a> And my assurance of this, which makes me full of joy and gratitude, is rested on the promise of God in His word (and its actual fulfilment at this day), and, amongst others, on the very texts given in the little book I have mentioned: so that they are proving what I joyfully confess and praise God for.<a name=12:7></a> And more, brethren, I say that it is the church of Christ who have the only hope of salvation; so that this is not the question between us at all.<a name=12:8></a> The question is, who is able to say that he is in that church, and keeping the sayings of the great Head of it?<a name=12:9></a> So that they should shew, which they do not, and it is absolutely impossible that they should do, that the church of Rome, and none else, is the church of Christ.<a name=12:10></a> On the contrary, brethren, I affirm, and I call upon you to search the scriptures whether it be so or not, that every true believer is a member of Christ, that is, one of His true church; as the Lord Christ says Himself, "I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.<a name=12:11></a>"<a href="#12:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Brethren, the fact is, the Church of Rome is universal in none, except by the antichristian assumption by the pope of what belongs to Christ alone.<a name=24:17></a> A large portion of professing Christians have no communion with the Church of Rome, and have never, at any period, admitted its supremacy.<a name=24:18></a> Its faith is not universal; it totally differs from, and is opposed to, "the faith once delivered to the saints"; and for this we appeal to the scriptures, which they cannot deny contain that faith.<a name=24:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Not only, brethren, are they opposed to the scriptures, but the articles which we renounce have been added to the creed, in express defiance of the authority of the primitive church itself.<a name=25:1></a> In the year 449 the third General Council, which sat at Ephesus to maintain the truth against heresies, expressly decreed that no innovation should be made on the creed then settled.<a name=25:2></a> In the eighth century after Christ, Pope Leo the third wrote to his Legate (who was attending assemblies of German and French bishops), in answer to an enquiry from him, stating, that no addition should be permitted to be made in the creed, which the French and German bishops were thinking of making; and he set up, out of the archives at Rome, silver tablets in St.<a name=25:3></a> Peter's and St.<a name=25:4></a> Paul's, with the creed engraved on them, as a memorial of what it was then, for the very purpose that nothing should be changed or added.<a name=25:5></a> This happened a thousand years ago.<a name=25:6></a> Now the great difference between the Greek Church (which denies the supremacy of Rome, and is separated from it) and the Roman (which calls itself catholic) is the addition which this tablet was put up to prevent, and which the Greeks have not agreed to the insertion of.<a name=25:7></a> And most of the great points in which we, who deny both the catholicity and the supremacy of the church of Rome, differ from you, are, twelve new points added at the time of the Reformation to the creed by Pope Pius the fourth and the Council of Trent.<a name=25:8></a> So that, far from their being catholic in point of faith, we are sanctioned in our separation from them, not only by the scriptures, which these new doctrines of theirs are quite contrary to, but they are, in adding them to the creed and attempting to impose them on us, expressly condemned by a General Council, which they receive and declare to be of divine authority, which sat fourteen hundred years ago.<a name=25:9></a> And the Greek Church, which they also condemn as schismatic is, to say the least, justified in its separation by the authority of one of their own popes who took the pains of fixing up a silver tablet to prevent that which after popes did or acquiesced in.<a name=25:10></a> So utterly unfounded are they in the pretensions which they set up in order to keep you in bondage.<a name=25:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And this fact is as strong against their pretence of infallibility as catholicity; for we have the church four or five hundred years after Christ, expressly decreeing that no article shall be added; and we have those who call themselves the church, fifteen or sixteen hundred years after Christ, adding twelve articles as matters of faith, and rejecting all who deny them.<a name=25:12></a> Was the church in the first ages, or the church of Rome at the Reformation in the right?<a name=25:13></a> or how can that be infallible which contradicts itself?<a name=25:14></a> But the true catholic church, brethren, that seed of God, which shall indeed never fail, the body of Christ, the real communion of saints, the one holy catholic and apostolic church, subsists in the company of true believers, in every age united to the great Head, Christ Jesus, by His Spirit dwelling in them, and incorporating them into His mystical body.<a name=25:15></a> And while the power of the Lord lasts, even to the end of the world, while the influences of the divine Spirit shew to souls His glory in hope, so long will there be a church upon earth.<a name=25:16></a> But to say that this is any particular communion or body of professing Christians (and that too without inquiring whether they hold the faith once delivered to the saints) is nothing else but the spirit of Antichrist.<a name=25:17></a>

		The point, brethren, is this -- there are certain doctrines in which the faith and hopes of a professor of the Christian religion are deeply concerned.<a name=27:1></a> You are told you ought to believe these doctrines.<a name=27:2></a> We say there is no foundation for them, and not only so, but that the belief in them precludes the faith by which we find the power and comfort of the gospel of the Son of God come in the flesh; and we appeal to the scriptures, confessed by all to be inspired, and given to us by God for our edification in the truth, written by apostles and evangelists commissioned by God, so that they might say, and none could deny, "he that is of God heareth us.<a name=27:3></a>" And we declare to you as honest men, that a person reading them with the assistance of God's grace will find none of these doctrines in them, but what is entirely inconsistent with them, and your teachers, while they dare not deny that the scriptures do contain the truth of God, will not let you read them to see whether these things be so, as we say: while we know that the Bereans are expressly commended for so doing: "they were more noble, searching the scriptures daily whether those things were so.<a name=27:4></a>"<a href="#27:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So that we may put the case thus: we agree that the first doctrines are the true ones, as coming from Christ and the inspired apostles: the question is, how we are to find what they are?<a name=28:5></a> You take it at the priest's word, who comes eighteen hundred years after them.<a name=28:6></a> We appeal to the scriptures, which record Christ's sayings, as none of you deny, and contain the apostles' writings, as none of you deny: is not this a good way of finding out what that first religion was which they taught?<a name=28:7></a> And not only do we shew that we use the right way to follow the first religion, which I agree we are bound to do; but we shew you as a matter of direct history, that they have added twelve articles to the creed which was in use in the primitive or old church, and which is commonly called the Nicene creed.<a name=28:8></a> I take for granted you know the creed.<a name=28:9></a> Now will you tell me what there is in that about the Virgin Mary, or that the saints are mediators?<a name=28:10></a> Ought not this to make you doubt whether you are not misled in being made to believe things which are not in the creed, when they refuse you the scriptures to see if they are there; and when, too, a General Council prohibited any new creed to be made, beside what is called the Nicene creed?<a name=28:11></a>

		There is one thing more, brethren (which I should never mention; I should in truth be ashamed to mention it, but that it is commonly said amongst you) that is, that Peter stands at the gate of heaven with the keys, and lets in the Romanists as belonging to the true church, and keeps out other people.<a name=28:12></a> Now, brethren, you will not deny that, as Paul says, "we must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.<a name=28:13></a>"<a href="#28:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a> Keep this in mind: good and bad, we are all to stand at the judgment-seat of Christ.<a name=28:14></a> Now this is quite out of the question if that be true about Peter; for, according to that, they will never get to the judgment-seat of Christ, or perhaps you will say it is after they have been judged.<a name=28:15></a> But then Peter need not be there at all, for those that the Lord rejects He sends away to hell: as it is written, "Depart ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.<a name=28:16></a> <a href="#28:f3"><sup class="footnote-link">+++</sup></a>

		Brethren, I have spoken of these things for your soul's sake, With sorrow of heart.<a name=29:1></a> We are all sinners, and under just judgment in the sight of a holy God, who is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity; nor Can there be any sound real hope to see His face, unless We are cleansed from all sin.<a name=29:2></a> It is the very truth and purpose of the gospel to assure us, that there is perfect and entire remission of them in Christ Jesus, for those that believe in Him, and that His blood cleanses from all sin; and also this further blessing to those who by the work of His grace have been brought to desire holiness, that He "Will put his law into our hearts, and write it in our minds.<a name=29:3></a>" Instead of saying to us, "If you do not do so and so, to keep my law, you will be condemned"; He says, "I have mercy upon you; I will put the love of my law in your hearts; I will give you a new heart; and your sins and iniquities I will remember no more.<a name=29:4></a>"<a href="#29:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>: This is what God has said, brethren, and why should you not believe Him?<a name=29:5></a> Oh!<a name=29:6></a> comfort to a soul weary in itself, to a heavy burdened conscience, to hear the Lord from heaven saying, "Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.<a name=29:7></a>" And again, "Your sins and iniquities will I remember no more.<a name=29:8></a>" Think of this.<a name=29:9></a>

		ROMANISM: OR AN ANSWER TO THE PAMPHLET OF A ROMISH PRIEST, ENTITLED "THE LAW AND THE TESTIMONY"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And you have not one word, then, to say for the Mass, the very centre and distinguishing feature of the whole Romanist system!<a name=30:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The omission is intelligible, but remarkable.<a name=30:2></a> The pretension to offer Christ still, as a propitiatory sacrifice for the sins of the living and the dead, is so subversive of Christianity, so contrary to the express testimony of the word of God, that it is natural for one who seeks to conciliate Protestants to Romish doctrines to pass over it in silence, if he can.<a name=30:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The best way to win to these doctrines is to conceal them, to direct the attention from them.<a name=30:4></a> You cannot deny that the Mass is the centre of your whole system.<a name=30:5></a> "He goes to Mass" is the very term familiarly used to designate a Romanist; "he goes to church," to mark out a Protestant.<a name=30:6></a> Why have you omitted this subject in your effort to enlighten poor Roman Catholics and disabuse prejudiced Protestants?<a name=30:7></a> The pretence to have a sacrifice still offered up on earth, when the word of God declares, that "by <i>one offering</i> Christ has perfected for ever them that are sanctified"; that "there is <i>no more</i> offering for sin, where remission of sins is"; that a continual offering was a memorial of sins, proving that they were not put away -- the declaration that you have an unbloody sacrifice, when the word of God declares, that "without shedding of blood there is no remission," and that consequently, if the oblation of Christ was to be repeated, He must often have suffered: such a plain distinct testimony of God's word on the very point, makes it natural you should omit all mention of it.<a name=30:8></a> The sacrifice of the Mass is the proof that, in what calls itself the church of Rome, there is no true remission of sins; for "where remission of sins is, there is no more offering for sin.<a name=30:9></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is a very solemn point, dear reader.<a name=30:10></a> If the word of God be true, there is no remission of sins in the so-called church of Rome.<a name=30:11></a> Hence, those belonging to it are continually, as the poor Jews were, "offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins"; for they are unbloody sacrifices, and without shedding of blood there is no remission.<a name=30:12></a> Romanism has a form of piety, but it denies the substance.<a name=30:13></a> God forbid that I should use a hard word as to souls as precious as my own, and who believe they are in the right; whom, I trust and believe, I love with unfeigned charity; such as I have lived amongst for years, and loved and served as well as I knew how.<a name=30:14></a> It is not want of love to speak plainly in what concerns the salvation of souls.<a name=30:15></a> I would not use an abusive or hard word that could offend them, but I say plainly, that that is not the church of God, nor is the true remission of sins to be found, where a sacrifice is still pretended to be offered.<a name=30:16></a> "For where remission of sins is, there is no more offering for sin.<a name=30:17></a>" The church of God enjoys the perfect remission of sins by one perfect sacrifice, in which the precious blood of Christ was shed, offered once for all, and which never can be repeated; for Christ can die no more -- can never suffer again, nor need He, for He has by one offering perfected for ever them that are sanctified.<a name=30:18></a> The Mass is but a return to the weakness of Judaism.<a name=30:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence this one capital point is sufficient for everyone taught of God, and must lead everyone who bows to the word of God to reject the Romish system as an entire departure from Christianity as revealed of God.<a name=31:1></a> Yet I will take up briefly the different points the author of "Law and Testimony" has touched upon.<a name=31:2></a> And, first, some general observations which I would address to the writer.<a name=31:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You lean much upon the Fathers.<a name=31:4></a> Forgive me if I think you have not much read them.<a name=31:5></a> You tell us, that you have taken from the authenticated work of every author you have quoted, as may be ascertained by reference to their writings.<a name=31:6></a> Now, that you are not personally acquainted with them, you have afforded most unequivocal proof in your pamphlet, in this: that you have supposed the Clement who wrote the Stromata to be the Clement who was, as you say, a "fellow-labourer of the apostles, who was Pope of Rome, third after Peter, and is often mentioned by St.<a name=31:7></a> Paul, in his Epistles.<a name=31:8></a>" "The church, <i>he</i> writes," you say, "which is one," etc.<a name=31:9></a>, and you quote "St.<a name=31:10></a> Clem.<a name=31:11></a> 7 Stromat.<a name=31:12></a>" Now, the very smallest acquaintance with the Fathers would have saved you so glaring a mistake as you have here made.<a name=31:13></a> There was a Clement, companion of Paul, who wrote a letter to the church of Corinth, and who (though there is the greatest confusion and contradiction<a href="#31:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> as to the succession of the first bishops of Rome) is stated by respectable historians to have been the third bishop of Rome.<a name=31:14></a> Two letters have been attributed to him; one is believed to be authentic -- a pious effort to compose the strifes of the church of Corinth.<a name=31:15></a> But (must I say so?<a name=31:16></a> As my readers may be peasants of the North of Ireland, it may be necessary) Clement of Alexandria, who never was a bishop at all, was the author of the Stromata.<a name=31:17></a> He flourished from 192 A.<a name=31:18></a>D.<a name=31:19></a> to the beginning of the third century.<a name=31:20></a> He was president of the school of Alexandria.<a name=31:21></a> He was a great philosopher as well as a Christian, but of doubtful soundness<a href="#31:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a> enough on some points, and full of philosophical speculations.<a name=31:22></a> However, whatever the value of Clement's opinions, one thing is quite clear, that you did not consult him yourself; whether you did the other Fathers, which you quote, every one must judge by this example for himself.<a name=31:23></a> One thing is certain: you must be an utter stranger to the Fathers, to have taken Clement of Alexandria for Clement of Rome.<a name=31:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#31:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>Some make Clement Peter's successor; others the fourth, putting Linus and Anacletus between; some seek to reconcile the two accounts by saying Linus and Anacletus were bishops under Peter, in his lifetime.

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Your definition of the church introduces another point in which the flagrant departure of Romanism from the Christianity taught by the apostles betrays itself in a remarkable manner.<a name=32:1></a> It is, you say, an assembly of Christians, united by the profession of the same true faith, and communion of the same sacraments, under the government of lawful pastors, whose head is the pope.<a name=32:2></a> Now scripture is as explicit as possible in saying that Christ is its head -- and it cannot have two.<a name=32:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The statement of the Catechism of the Council of Trent is curious enough on this point.<a name=32:4></a> It says -- it could not say otherwise -- this church has also but one ruler and governor, the invisible one, Christ, whom the Eternal Father hath made head over all the church, which is His body; the visible one, him who, as legitimate successor of Peter, the prince of the apostles, fills the apostolic chair.<a name=32:5></a> One would have thought that made two.<a name=32:6></a> God "gave him to be head over all things to the church, which is his body"; or, if you prefer the Rhemish translation, "hath made him head over all, to the church which is his body" (Ephesians 1: 22, 23); and again (chapter 5: 23), "the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ is the head of the church.<a name=32:7></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=33>[Page 33]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this is practically very important, because the glorious Head, living in heaven, gives the true church, His body, a heavenly character, though <i>its</i> members may be despised on earth; whereas a glorious head on earth, greater than emperors and princes in the eyes of men, gives it a worldly character which neither Christ nor the true church ever had: besides Christ as the Head is a source of grace, which it is impossible the pope or any man can be.<a name=33:1></a> But the grand point is, Christ is the one sole Head of the true church; the pope is the head of yours; therefore yours is certainly not the true.<a name=33:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One little word in addition as to your definition.<a name=33:3></a> You tell us it is an assembly of Christians united by the profession of the same true faith.<a name=33:4></a> Hence, as there are millions in the Greek church who say they are the true church, and millions of Protestants who say they are, and millions of Catholics who say they are: and you tell me that their being united in the same true faith is part of the definition by which I shall know which is the true one, I must find out what the true faith is, before I know which Christ's church is, or if any of them are; for each of them tells me it is.<a name=33:5></a> Of course they honestly think themselves so; and you tell me that profession of the true faith marks the true church.<a name=33:6></a> Well then I must necessarily know what is the true faith, to know who professes it; that is, I find the true faith before I find the church.<a name=33:7></a> And so it always was; for it was on receiving the true faith from the apostles, or other servants of Christ, that people at the first became members of the church; and they did not, and could not, become so otherwise.<a name=33:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, again, you give us the usual marks of unity -- sanctity catholicity, apostolicity, and add infallibility, perpetual visibility.<a name=33:9></a> The first four are given in "Milner's End of Controversy"; indeed they are the well-known marks as given in the Catechism of the Council of Trent.<a name=33:10></a> Nowhere is the truth given as a mark of the true church.<a name=33:11></a> This is strange -- still more strange, since in your definition of the church, the profession of the true faith is made essential to it.<a name=33:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is very convenient to assume it as a definition, and to drop it as a mark; but you have replaced it by a very convenient substitute -- infallibility, which means, take it for true without inquiry.<a name=33:13></a> Before, I was to take the true faith, as shewing Christ's church; now, I must without inquiry take the church and all it teaches, as securing the truth for me.<a name=33:14></a> Which is the right way?<a name=33:15></a> Both cannot be.<a name=33:16></a> Holding and professing the truth are not infallibility.<a name=33:17></a> Every true Christian holds and professes the truth, but he is not infallible.<a name=33:18></a> If the church professes the true faith, she holds a true faith which exists all ready to be professed, as it was given by inspiration to those whom Christ sent to reveal it.<a name=33:19></a> If she is infallible, she is the <i>source</i> of truth, not the receiver of it.<a name=33:20></a> Now that is true of God alone.<a name=33:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=34>[Page 34]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, in giving the first four marks, you allege your system justifies you.<a name=34:1></a> They are those given in the Catechism of the Council of Trent.<a name=34:2></a> The only point I would now insist upon here is this very solemn one, that the truth forms no mark of the true church in the system of Rome.<a name=34:3></a> She dare not present it as a test; she disclaims it, she avoids it.<a name=34:4></a> She pleads unity, sanctity, catholicity, apostolicity.<a name=34:5></a> We will examine these just now.<a name=34:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Truth cannot be borne as a test.<a name=34:7></a> All that is taught is to be received without any test at all, though an apostle could say, "Prove all things, hold fast that which is good.<a name=34:8></a>" They of Berea were noble in the apostle's eyes, because they searched the scriptures to see whether these things were so.<a name=34:9></a> But the test of truth cannot be endured at Rome; it is not pretended to be one of the marks of the Romish body.<a name=34:10></a> In place of that, it would impose all it teaches without any test at all -- pretending to be infallible, which is the attribute of God only.<a name=34:11></a> Do I assert that man, by his own powers, is able to fathom the truth?<a name=34:12></a> No; but the Lord has said, "They shall be all taught of God; whosoever, therefore, hath heard and learned of the Father, cometh unto me.<a name=34:13></a>" God may employ any one, a minister of the word, a mother, a friend, a book to present the truth -- grace applies it to the heart; <i>that</i>, the church, even the true church, has no pretensions to do, though she is an instrument to hold the truth up before men; but God alone can bring it home.<a name=34:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On the other hand, the Roman Catholic, having relinquished the truth as a test of the true church, saying that the truth is to be searched for in vain, leans not on grace, but entirely upon human powers, to find the true church.<a name=34:15></a> He points out, to use the words of a celebrated controversialist and bishop, "certain exterior visible marks, such as plain unlearned persons can discover, if they will take ordinary pains for this purpose, no less than persons of the greatest abilities and literature.<a name=34:16></a>" This is stated in reply to the marks of the true church, which the author declares to be laid down by Luther, Calvin, and the Church of England -- namely, truth of doctrine, and the right administration of the sacraments.<a name=34:17></a> That is, truth of doctrine and the right administration of the sacraments are objected to as adequate marks of the true church, by which it may be known.<a name=34:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=35>[Page 35]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, if it be a question for heathens or Jews -- for them the whole question is, just how to be saved.<a name=35:1></a> If they believe and are baptized, they are saved, and members, it is to be supposed, of the true church, before they have discussed its merits at all.<a name=35:2></a> If it be a question which arises among Christians, who seek among Roman Catholics, and Protestants, and Presbyterians, and other bodies, where the true church is to be found; if, I say, the question arises among Christians, they have not all knowledge, doubtless, but they have saving faith, or they are not Christians at all; and hence, the truth is a most sure means of ascertaining the true church.<a name=35:3></a> Thus, if I know, as a matter of my own salvation, that the divinity and atonement of Christ are the very truth of God, and I found everything calling itself a church which denied these fundamental doctrines, I could at once say, That is not the true church.<a name=35:4></a> Souls may be ignorantly in error there -- may come to the knowledge of the truth and be saved; but I cannot own the body as the true church of God.<a name=35:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And here a great and important question arises, on which I desire to say a few words, from its intrinsic importance, though the book I am commenting on relieves me from the necessity.<a name=35:6></a> They quote the scriptures, and, consequently, suppose us capable of understanding them, heretics though we may be, capable of receiving proof from them.<a name=35:7></a> But the subject is too important to pass it over with this remark, conclusive though it be.<a name=35:8></a> It is said we cannot judge scripture; it is alleged that laws require judges, and the like.<a name=35:9></a> Now I do not go upon the ground of our capacity to judge scripture.<a name=35:10></a> My reason, dear reader, is very simple -- it judges us.<a name=35:11></a> "The words that I speak unto you," says the Lord, "shall judge you in the last day.<a name=35:12></a>" "The word of God is sharper than any two-edged sword, and pierceth to the dividing asunder of joints and marrow, and soul and spirit, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.<a name=35:13></a>" There is a conscience in every man; God's word speaks to it, and judges everything in his heart.<a name=35:14></a> It is the light which manifests all things -- the revelation of God and of Christ, who is light.<a name=35:15></a> I do not judge if the light be clean; it shews whether I am.<a name=35:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=36>[Page 36]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When Christ was in the world, when He spoke the words of God, were not men bound to receive them on peril of condemnation?<a name=36:1></a> Did it require the church's authority to lead men to receive it?<a name=36:2></a> All the religious authorities -- authorities which they quote to confirm their doctrine -- rejected Him.<a name=36:3></a> Are His words less binding, less true, less holy, less gracious now?<a name=36:4></a> The word of God is not judged -- it judges.<a name=36:5></a> Woe be to the man who hardens his heart against it!<a name=36:6></a> Men did then: what was the consequence?<a name=36:7></a> God, by John Baptist, mourned to them, they would not lament; He piped to them, they would not dance.<a name=36:8></a> Hardening their consciences against the conviction of sin, they (to use the words of the blessed Lord) rejected the counsel of God against themselves; that is, to their own eternal ruin.<a name=36:9></a> The word (which was, and, blessed be God, yet is spoken and sent in grace) will judge them, and all who reject it in the last day; for God knows that, when He sent it in grace, He sent it with ample proofs to men's hearts and consciences that it is His word.<a name=36:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But a word more on this.<a name=36:11></a> It is not denied that the scriptures are the word of God.<a name=36:12></a> The Council of Trent has added seven books to the canon, never publicly received into it before, and against the express testimony of Jerome, the author of the Vulgate translation, which they receive as authentic.<a name=36:13></a> But leaving these contested ones for the moment (for in the New Testament there are none such), they own that the scriptures are the word of God.<a name=36:14></a> They own that Peter wrote his epistles as an inspired apostle; Paul his, John his, and so of the other books of the New Testament (and the same holds good as to all the Old Testament, to the Jews).<a name=36:15></a> Now, save the Epistles to Timothy and Titus, all the books of the New Testament are addressed to all the faithful; in one epistle, that to the Philippians, the bishops and deacons being added.<a name=36:16></a> That is, to express myself in modern language, the New Testament was addressed not to the clergy but by the clergy, the highest and wisest of them assuredly, to all the faithful in general, or in particular places.<a name=36:17></a> Now, if the faithful in general were incompetent to use them, how came the apostle to write them to them?<a name=36:18></a> The apostles thought what they wrote was suited to the mass of the faithful; you think it is not; which is right?<a name=36:19></a> And mark what a monstrous position you put yourselves in -- the apostles wrote (to say nothing of the guidance of the Holy Ghost yet) in the way they thought best suited to the mass of the faithful, writing to all of them; and even in one case particularly insisting that care should be taken that it was read to all.<a name=36:20></a> You think you can do it better than they.<a name=36:21></a> What monstrous presumption!<a name=36:22></a> Did they do it badly, in a wrong manner, so that you can do it better?<a name=36:23></a> If really looked into, it is blasphemy; for it is the Spirit of God who addressed all this, save the Epistles to Timothy and Titus, to all the common mass of the faithful.<a name=36:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=37>[Page 37]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But another very solemn question arises here, that of the authority of God in the matter.<a name=37:1></a> God did address the writings in question to the mass of the faithful as binding on their consciences, directing their lives and rejoicing their hearts.<a name=37:2></a> Now I do not insist here on the right of every Christian to read the scriptures (though no man has a right to call it in question), but on the right of God to address Himself to whom He will, and of the sin of intercepting what He has addressed to His servants.<a name=37:3></a> If I have sent directions and promises to my servants, he who hinders their having them as I send them, and directly from myself, meddles, not with the right of the servants, but with mine.<a name=37:4></a> God has sent His word to the faithful, not to the clergy (I except Timothy and Titus, as to this argument, however profitable, and in spirit binding on all).<a name=37:5></a> He who hinders their receiving it, or pretends to claim control over their getting it, flies in the face of God's authority and God's own acts.<a name=37:6></a> To pretend to communicate God's thoughts better and more clearly than His inspired apostles, and to hinder His communications reaching His own servants, when He has addressed them to them, is a strange way of proving any to be the true church of God.<a name=37:7></a> And that is exactly what the clergy of the Roman Catholic system do.<a name=37:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I will enter on your marks of the true church.<a name=37:9></a> They are unity, sanctity, catholicity, and apostolicity.<a name=37:10></a> You refer to some other points, which I will advert to in their place.<a name=37:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, unity.<a name=37:12></a> That the church of God was one at the beginning, and manifestly and publicly such, is evident to every one that reads the scriptures.<a name=37:13></a> That it is not, if we consider it as a public visible body on earth (for the true body of Christ will be infallibly so in glory, and is so always in the living unity of the Spirit) is equally evident, from the simple fact that we are inquiring which of two or three bodies, or if any of them, be the true church.<a name=37:14></a> Unity of doctrine, and general discipline, which you give as being unity, is not sufficient.<a name=37:15></a> These may prove sameness in two bodies, as well as unity.<a name=37:16></a> There must be corporate unity -- a single body.<a name=37:17></a> I therefore seek more than you do in unity.<a name=37:18></a> Further, your proofs of unity are utterly vain and useless; they are as true of the Greek body, which detests and rejects you, as of the Romish, which denounces the Greek as schismatic and heretical.<a name=37:19></a> They have bishops and the assemblings on Sundays, and the Eucharist, and the same doctrines, and the same general discipline, which you plead as proofs for Rome.<a name=37:20></a> You would find these in the Protestant Episcopal church too all over tile world.<a name=37:21></a> Perhaps, indeed, we may except a confession to a priest.<a name=37:22></a> But what a strange mark of unity you have given us here.<a name=37:23></a> It is perfectly certain that if it be one, no Christian for centuries after Christ was in the one true church.<a name=37:24></a> There is not an historical point more incontestable than this, that private confession to a priest is a novelty unknown to the early church.<a name=37:25></a> After the earliest times men did public penance for scandalous falls, and no confession was imposed as to others.<a name=37:26></a> There was indeed for a time one penitentiary priest at Constantinople, and, as it appears elsewhere; and such scandal arose, on a certain occasion, from it, that it was abolished by Nectarius; and his successor, Chrysostom, at the end of the fourth century, urges, over and over again, confession to God alone.<a name=37:27></a> Augustine's words are equally clear; so are Ambrose's.<a name=37:28></a> In the thirteenth century alone it was first made obligatory by the Lateran Council under Innocent III -- the same pope under whom the Inquisition was established, and the Crusades formed against the Albigenses, and the atrocities of that "holy war" perpetrated in the south of France.<a name=37:29></a>

		I have spoken briefly of three of the marks of the true church -- unity, apostolicity, catholicity.<a name=42:11></a> As to unity, the Romish body is one, the Greek church is one, and so of others: but general visible unity is lost, or we should not have to inquire which is the true church.<a name=42:12></a> Catholicity, or universality, you have given up the pretension to; you claim only a majority; so that, if universality be a test, Romanists have not the true church, nor, since there are Romanists, any other body either.<a name=42:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This test, by your own confession, and change of it into a simple majority (itself more than doubtful), makes the whole ground on which you search for the true church a perfect absurdity.<a name=42:14></a> Your own statement proves, if universality be a test, that there is no true visible church at all.<a name=42:15></a> Lastly, apostolicity is the most absurd test imaginable; for, while pretending to be simple and external, the succession of bishops from the apostles' day must be ascertained, or the mark does not exist at all.<a name=42:16></a> And in the next place Greeks, Armenians, Syrians, and even Protestant Episcopalians have it, and prove it as gaily as Romanists themselves; while the only place where it is known to be most grievously damaged and upset is in the papal succession, where for fifty years there were two popes at a time, both ordaining other successions; and at last three, all put down for heresy, and another set up by a council which upset all their claims together.<a name=42:17></a> I have reserved the question of sanctity: it is a painful one, and I shall speak of it at the close.<a name=42:18></a>

		I shall now refer to your use of scripture.<a name=43:1></a> First, your quotation of it is important.<a name=43:2></a> It is then available, intelligible to the faithful, and conclusive.<a name=43:3></a> We can understand it with God's help (without which we can do nothing right), and it binds our conscience.<a name=43:4></a> Your use of it is another thing.<a name=43:5></a> You quote, for example, passages, or parts of passages (for one is applicable to the state of glory), saying, that Christ would have one fold and one shepherd (that is, no longer Jews or Gentiles as distinct people); Christ's prayer, that they all may be one; then the passage which applies to glory ("the glory that thou hast given me I have given them," precedes what you quote).<a name=43:6></a> Paul's direction to the faithful, to be careful to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace; a direction to Timothy to keep what was committed to his trust; and one to Titus to reject heretics.<a name=43:7></a> It is clear, you say, from all these texts, that no one can be a member of the church of Christ unless he holds the same doctrine as she teaches.<a name=43:8></a> Well, how this conclusion flows from a prayer for unity, or an exhortation to keep it in the bond of peace, is, I confess, beyond me, and, with all humility, I apprehend beyond anybody; because there is nothing in the passages you quote about the conclusion which you draw.<a name=43:9></a> Common sense tells us, that a person who is a member of a body, and does not hold what it teaches, is, in some respects, inconsistent.<a name=43:10></a> But your conclusion is utterly false; for either the church must teach some error, or no member can ever be in any error whatever without ceasing thereby to be a member of the church at all; for if he be in any error, he holds something the church does not teach, or else she teaches error.<a name=43:11></a>

		But, though you tell us the texts prove it, you (strangely enough) give in the same sentence a totally different reason for it.<a name=43:12></a> The church has received authority from Christ to teach all nations.<a name=43:13></a> Allow me to correct an error of a very grave character, on which all your reasoning, and all the Romish reasoning, is founded.<a name=43:14></a> You say the church teaches.<a name=43:15></a> Now I deny that the church teaches at all; she holds the truth, has learned the truth, is sanctified by the truth; she teaches nothing.<a name=43:16></a> She is taught, and has learned.<a name=43:17></a> Ministers, whom God has sent for that purpose, teach.<a name=43:18></a> It was never said to the church, "Go ye and teach all nations.<a name=43:19></a>" It was said to the apostles, when Christ ascended; and they went and taught, as did certain others, sent by the Holy Ghost; and the church was gathered and built up.<a name=43:20></a> Then those whom God raised up as pastors and teachers, waited, or were to wait on their teaching.<a name=43:21></a>

		This is all you have to say for the unity of the church.<a name=44:9></a> The unity of the church I believe to be a most precious truth; but if you place it where you do, scripture will not bear you out, because it speaks of the saved, quickened, sanctified members of Christ, called to glory, as His body, the church.<a name=44:10></a> There is another view of the church.<a name=44:11></a> It is the habitation of God through the Spirit; Ephesians 2.<a name=44:12></a> As the body of Christ, it is surely preserved and kept; but as a responsible body on earth, its career will certainly close.<a name=44:13></a> A falling away will come.<a name=44:14></a> This is positively declared in scripture: "that day will not come unless there be the falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, who exalteth himself above all that is called God or worshipped.<a name=44:15></a>"

		As regards the texts to prove the universality, you quote a number of passages which do not apply to the church at all, in which she is never named, and the context of which proves to demonstration that they do not apply to the church.<a name=45:1></a> I shall quote one to shew how utterly untenable this application is: "Ask of me and I will give thee the Gentiles for thine inheritance, and thy possession to the ends of the earth.<a name=45:2></a>" But continue: "Thou shall rule them with a rod of iron, and dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.<a name=45:3></a>" Is that the church, or judgment?<a name=45:4></a> Any one may see, by looking at the epistle to Thyatira in Revelation 2, that it is a judgment to be executed when the church is glorified with Christ.<a name=45:5></a> But your proof that these promises apply to the church destroys, on the contrary, all your arguments.<a name=45:6></a> You say they are to be fulfilled in the last days.<a name=45:7></a> To prove that the last days mean the time of the church and its universal prevalence, you quote the passage of John, which shews that the last days are those of Antichrist.<a name=45:8></a> Is the time of Antichrist's rule the time of all nations flowing into the church?<a name=45:9></a> For that s the passage you are proving applies to the universal prevalence of the church.<a name=45:10></a> Why, in Antichrist's time, instead of all nations flowing into the church, if any one confesses Christ he will be killed.<a name=45:11></a> Your friends, the Fathers, speak with the most terrible apprehensions of those days, when Christianity is to hide itself in dens and caves, and, save in such places, scarce such a thing as a Christian known, and if known, slain by apostate fury.<a name=45:12></a> This was a very untoward proof of your doctrine.<a name=45:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Another proof you give us of the universality of the church is, that the gospel is to be preached in all the earth.<a name=45:14></a> This is more untoward still, because this is not done yet, very far from it; as gathering the nations, the very large majority remain heathen, and a very great part have never been visited by the preachers of the gospel.<a name=45:15></a> So that the mark of catholicity or universality is not yet to be found at all.<a name=45:16></a> If all the ends of the earth seeing the salvation of our God applies to and means the catholicity of the church, then the church is not catholic yet: for all the ends of the earth have not seen the salvation of our God.<a name=45:17></a>

		Here your mild winning preface gives place to judgment.<a name=48:1></a> You quote a passage which applies to the last and final message of the Lord Jesus to the Jews, and in which He declares judgment on that impenitent race, if they did not receive it; and you apply His title in sending it to yourselves, and His denunciations to your Protestant brethren, as you call them.<a name=48:2></a> Happily we are not Jews, and you are not Christ.<a name=48:3></a> Your threats do not awaken terror, but pity for your presumption and ignorance of the passage which you thus quote at random.<a name=48:4></a> The apostles were strictly forbidden on this journey to go to any but the <i>house of Israel</i>.<a name=48:5></a> They were not to go near a Gentile, shewing the true character of their mission.<a name=48:6></a>

		In fine, the passages you quote, which embrace the whole world in prospect, prove, not indeed that Christ has failed in preserving the true church, His body -- those livingly united to Him by the Spirit -- those whom the Father has given Him (as He says, "Those whom thou hast given me I have kept"), for this is impossible; but that the visible church, those particularly called clergy, have wholly failed in acting up to the responsibility connected with these passages.<a name=48:7></a> They have not to this hour, though eighteen centuries have elapsed, carried the gospel into all the world.<a name=48:8></a> Instead of that, another thing has happened.<a name=48:9></a> So corrupt was the visible church, that God has allowed the greater part of what was professing Christendom to be overrun with Mahometanism,<a href="#48:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> which has spread AT LEAST as widely as Christianity; and what you call the Catholic church has had so little spiritual power, that well-nigh half the church split off from it, and became the Greek church (I am speaking according to its own pretensions, for I believe what you call the Catholic church to be Babylon); and subsequently, by the grossness of its corruptions, lost nearly half the countries which remained to it; and in others, as France, Belgium, Bohemia, and Moravia, only escaped the same result by suppressing by the most cruel persecutions the profession of the truth -- in Spain and Italy burning those who had any conscience in maintaining it, and in France celebrating the horrible massacre of St.<a name=48:10></a> Bartholomew by medal and rejoicing.<a name=48:11></a>

		Have you never read so much as this warning, drawn from the case of Israel: "On thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness, <i>otherwise thou also shalt be cut off</i>?<a name=49:1></a>" Of the professing church you have lost rather more than half; of the heathen world you have not gathered in a quarter, yet you claim catholicity -- that is, universality -- on such texts as, "All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.<a name=49:2></a>" Have you not shame in quoting it?<a name=49:3></a>

		But this leads me to your next question -- the infallibility of the church.<a name=49:4></a> You have quoted passages from the Old and New Testament to prove the church is infallible.<a name=49:5></a> First, for the quotations from the Old, if I can call quotations passages, or bits of passages, with the beginning or end or middle left out.<a name=49:6></a> I can hardly think you read the passages, as I have no wish to have an ungracious thought of you.<a name=49:7></a> But you must allow me, at the risk of being tedious, to refer to and complete those passages you have adduced.<a name=49:8></a> Not one has the smallest reference to the church.<a name=49:9></a>

		The first is, "I have made a covenant with my elect, I have sworn to David, my servant, thy seed will I settle for ever.<a name=49:10></a>" Now, allow me to say, the church is neither David nor the seed of David, nor ever called so in scripture, nor by any sober man.<a name=49:11></a> And, further, if you will take the trouble to read the psalm, you will find that it is a plaint that the family of David is utterly overthrown, his crown thrown to the ground, and all that is contrary to the hope founded on this promise.<a name=49:12></a> Now do you mean that this has actually happened to the church?<a name=49:13></a> If so, what comes of your argument?<a name=49:14></a> You are unfortunate in your quotations.<a name=49:15></a> You see why I am unwilling to believe that you have read the passage you quote from.<a name=49:16></a> Now if you apply it to David's seed, of which it speaks, the case is quite clear.<a name=49:17></a> It has been set aside, their throne has been cast down, as Ezekiel speaks, "I will overturn, overturn, overturn it, till he come whose right it is, and I will give it him.<a name=49:18></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		I turn to other passages.<a name=50:6></a> Did you ever read Isaiah 66?<a name=50:7></a> This is what it says, "For, behold, Jehovah will come with fire, and with his chariots, like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.<a name=50:8></a> For by fire and by his sword will Jehovah plead with all flesh; and the slain of Jehovah shall be many.<a name=50:9></a>" Then he describes their idolatry and abominations, and continues, "For I know their works and their thoughts: it shall come, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come and see my glory.<a name=50:10></a> And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that escape of them unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal, and Javan, to the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.<a name=50:11></a> And they shall bring all your brethren for an offering unto Jehovah, out of all nations, upon horses," etc .<a name=50:12></a>.<a name=50:13></a>.<a name=50:14></a> .<a name=50:15></a> Then comes your extract, and after it follows this -- "And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith Jehovah.<a name=50:16></a> And they shall go forth and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me; for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.<a name=50:17></a>" Now do you believe that that applies to the church, and that it is this dreadful judgment of all flesh by Jehovah which has set up your clergy, brought out of all nations?<a name=50:18></a> or if you do believe it, do you think any sober Christian can think this an evidence that you have solid proofs of what the true church is?<a name=50:19></a>

		Now every one who has the smallest acquaintance with scripture history knows what the two kingdoms of Judah and Israel are which were separated in the time of Rehoboam, and what the land means where their fathers dwelt, and that it has nothing to do with the church founded by the apostles.<a name=52:1></a> But if you will apply it to the church, instead of proving the infallibility of the church, you prove that it has been divided, scattered, given up to idolatry and transgression, and that it is only when it is brought back from this state that God's sanctuary (which it had wholly lost) was <i>set up</i> in the midst of them, and that then the heathen would know that God sanctified it, <i>when</i> His sanctuary was in the midst of them.<a name=52:2></a> They had been in idolatry, divided and dispersed, and had not had God's sanctuary amongst them.<a name=52:3></a> Do you believe this applies to the church?<a name=52:4></a> But it is the passage, taking what your citation has left out of it.<a name=52:5></a> If it does apply to the church, does it prove its infallibility?<a name=52:6></a> And why do you cite only a part of the passage?<a name=52:7></a> I will not for a moment charge you with garbling scripture in this way, and applying passages in such a manner.<a name=52:8></a> Your church has taught you this; you have got it in her schools of theology, and have not examined for yourself.<a name=52:9></a> But do you think that your church's garbling passages, cutting out parts of them, leaving out the beginning or the end or the middle or all three, is a proof of her infallibility to a sober Christian taught of God or any man of sense at all?<a name=52:10></a> Of course, if a person examine nothing, there is no reason why he should not receive anything, even the church of Rome, or Mormonism, or anything which superstition or fanaticism may propose to his imagination.<a name=52:11></a>

		Again, an individual or the church may be kept in the truth by grace, and yet have no pretension to be infallible in teaching.<a name=54:1></a> Now I doubt not that God will maintain the truth in the earth, and the church too; though there may be partial failure, yet in spite of failure He will preserve it.<a name=54:2></a> But the church has nothing to do with teaching infallibly.<a name=54:3></a> She has to learn and hold and profess the truth, not to teach at all.<a name=54:4></a> Some of her members may; but no one says they are infallible.<a name=54:5></a> Somewhere God will always preserve the truth, and some witness to it, in the earth.<a name=54:6></a> Thus, when Arianism overspread the world, and the pope received it, and put his signature to its doctrines, many, though banished and persecuted and hidden through violence for the most part, still held fast the truth.<a name=54:7></a> So, amid the disputes and violence which characterized the conduct of ambitious bishops (so that one very large council of them, held at Ephesus, is called "the council of robbers" in ecclesiastical history), yet God preserved the substance of the truth.<a name=54:8></a> And if the Eastern church erred, and patriarchs erred, and popes became Arian, still some held fast the faith and a witness for it.<a name=54:9></a> You may find a whole council of bishops establishing semi-Arianism at Sirmium, and accepting Arianism at Ariminum and Selinica; but yet God preserved the truth.<a name=54:10></a>

		I now turn to the texts you quote; and first the famous passage -- "Upon this rock I will build my church.<a name=54:15></a>" Now the confession of Peter was a remarkable one; it was revealed to him by the Father Himself -- a personal favour conferred upon him, which belongs to no one else.<a name=54:16></a> We may receive his faith, as every true Christian does; but the revelation is not made directly to us but to Peter alone.<a name=54:17></a> "Blessed art thou, <i>Simon Barjonas</i>.<a name=54:18></a>" Now nobody is Simon Barjonas but himself, not even the other apostles, and certainly not Pius IX.<a name=54:19></a> Thus taught of God Peter made a confession which none had yet made -- Christ was the Son of the living <i>God</i>.<a name=54:20></a> Several had owned Him to be the Christ the Son of God, but he adds the <i>living</i> God.<a name=54:21></a> So in his epistle he says, "He hath begotten us to a living hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead; unto whom coming as unto a living stone, ye also as living stones," etc.<a name=54:22></a> Now, here was more than a Messiah come to the Jews, and owned to be, as in Psalm 2, Son of God.<a name=54:23></a> It was the power of life in God Himself which was displayed in Him; as He says, He is the resurrection and the life Himself.<a name=54:24></a> Now here, in the Person of Christ, was that power of life and resurrection on which <i>He</i> would build His church, and the gates of Hades -- that is, of Satan, as having the power of death -- should not prevail against it.<a name=54:25></a> It is always true.<a name=54:26></a> The resurrection of the saints will be the great final proof of it; the resurrection of Christ was the pledge of it, and has given us a living hope.<a name=54:27></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#55:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>It is well-known that this is the grand foundation for the pretensions of the pope. My interpretation, though flowing from my own full conviction, is, as to the main point, nothing new. The Fathers, whom the Romanist so much leans upon, give frequently the same. Thus Augustine -- "Thou art therefore Peter, and upon this Rock which thou hast confessed, upon this Rock which thou hast owned, saying, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God, I will build my church-that is, upon Myself, Son of the living God, I will build my church; I will build thee upon Me, not Me upon thee." (Sermon 76.) In the same sermon he says, "Because Christ is the Rock, Peter the Christian people": so in many places. Chrysostom says on the passage -- I borrow the quotation here from another -- "On the Rock, that is, the faith of his confession." Gregory I, or the Great, "Consolidate your life in the Rock of the church, that is, on the confession of the blessed Peter." Cyril of Alexandria gives two interpretations -- the two we have just referred to: one, that it is Christ in whom is all the church hid safe, as in a cave of a rock, leaving poor Peter out altogether, save as an individual member: the other, that it is the unmoved faith of Peter. *Pet) an oimai legon to akradanton eis pistin tou mathetou*. (Cyr. Alex. ii, 460, 593. Aubert.) Ambrose was cited by Luther in his dispute with Eck, as since by others -- "On this article of faith the church is founded." I do not quote these as the smallest authority, for, as is general with the Fathers, not only they do not agree with one another, but they do not agree with themselves; but to shew how little, after all, the most essential points of the foundations of Romish doctrine were matters of faith then, Cyril we have seen giving two interpretations, both rejecting the Romanist sense. Augustine, in his Retractions, says he had very often *(saepissime)* given the one I have quoted; for it was not said, Thou art Petra (a rock), but (Petrus) a stone; but that he had once applied it to Peter, following a hymn of Ambrose's and if the reader liked it better, he might choose that! (1 Retract. 21: 1). Think of a Father, whom the author so especially applauds, treating this mainstay of papal authority in such a manner! He once accepted the sense found in verses of St. Ambrose, which everyone was singing; but that afterwards, very often indeed, he had shewn that the rock was not Peter; but that if any reader liked the former meaning better, he had full liberty. If that is not a solid patristic foundation for the See of Rome, I know not what is! But the good Father did once render good service to the See of Rome. A certain pope, named Zosimus, had pronounced in favour of Pelagius and Celestius; but Augustine, in spite of this, maintained his grounds and set Zosimus right, who then condemned Pelagius and Celestius, whom he had before declared sound in the faith.

		But you mention two things in particular, which you say are founded on tradition, and which are not in scripture -- Lent and Sunday.<a name=67:1></a> The apostles, you say, instituted the solemn fast of Lent.<a name=67:2></a> If they did, certainly it is not found in Scripture.<a name=67:3></a> But let us see what the facts are.<a name=67:4></a> I need only quote Irenaeus, a godly Father of the church, who had heard Polycarp, who had heard John.<a name=67:5></a> There was a dispute between Victor, the bishop of Rome, and the churches of Asia, as to the celebrating of Easter.<a name=67:6></a> Victor would have it on Sunday, and the Asiatic churches celebrated it (as did all the old British, till the sixth or seventh century, if I remember right) on the day of the resurrection, whatever day of the week it fell upon.<a name=67:7></a> For the Passover was computed by moons, and was held upon the fourteenth day after the new moon, and the resurrection was three days of course after, and this did not always fall on a Sunday.<a name=67:8></a> The Easterns went by the days of the month, the Westerns by the days of the week.<a name=67:9></a> Well, Victor refused to own them as Christians at all.<a name=67:10></a> Irenaeus agreed, it seems, with Victor in opinion as to the day it should be kept upon.<a name=67:11></a> But earlier than this, some thirty or forty years before, the aged Polycarp, himself a disciple of John, came from Asia to Rome, to confer with Anicetus, bishop of Rome, about it.<a name=67:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Think of a disciple of John himself (and a most blessed old man he was, and a martyr too) going all wrong, and insisting on a tradition derived from John himself, contrary to the pope's tradition and his authority too!<a name=67:13></a> Well, Polycarp would not give in, nor Anicetus either; but they agreed, it seems, to part in peace, and each go his own way.<a name=67:14></a> But Victor, a more energetic and less Christian man than Anicetus, orders all the Christians in Asia to change their rules in this respect, and follow Rome, and give up their apostolic tradition.<a name=67:15></a> However, they would not; and then he excommunicated them all in mass, as far at least as Rome was concerned.<a name=67:16></a> It was thunder, however, not lightning, for they did not obey; and the bishops elsewhere continued in communion with them.<a name=67:17></a> This did not please all the bishops, says Eusebius, some of them writing pretty sharply to him (Victor); and Irenaeus warned him not to cut off whole churches who observed the tradition of their ancient customs.<a name=67:18></a> This was at the end of the second century; and then he adds (says Eusebius), not only was the controversy about the day, but about the form itself of the fast; for some think they ought to fast one day, others two, and others more, and some measure this day forty hours, day and night; and this variety of observance had not its birth first in our age, but began long before, with those who went before us .<a name=67:19></a>.<a name=67:20></a>.<a name=67:21></a> .<a name=67:22></a> And then he adds, and thus the disagreement as to the fast commends the unanimity of the faith.<a name=67:23></a> -- (Euseb.<a name=67:24></a> 5: 24).<a name=67:25></a>

		Now this little bit of ecclesiastical history gives occasion for one or two remarks: first, how the Roman bishop sought to satisfy his ambition, not quite two centuries after Christ; but, secondly, at the same time, not only Polycrates at Ephesus and others, but other bishops besides paid no attention to his orders, and even rebuked him sharply; thirdly, what a slippery thing tradition is!<a name=68:1></a> Here, as to this very Lent, which is adduced as a proof of apostolic tradition, Polycarp, who conversed with John, has one from him which he will not give up; because he who leaned on the Lord's bosom, he says, had so kept it and taught.<a name=68:2></a> But Victor, who professed to have Peter's and Paul's too, excommunicates whole churches, because, after Polycarp's clear tradition, they kept John's.<a name=68:3></a> Could not tradition secure certainty on such a trifle as this?<a name=68:4></a> The conflict was maintained till the fourth century, and even long after that the Asiatic way was maintained in certain churches derived from that country.<a name=68:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is urged that the Holy Ghost was to teach things the apostles could not receive while Christ was alive.<a name=68:6></a> No doubt; but what has this to do with tradition?<a name=68:7></a> Further, that the Holy Ghost was still teaching.<a name=68:8></a> This would tend to shew that tradition was not needed; for, in that case, the church had always the same teaching as the apostles themselves, and did not want theirs by word or letter.<a name=68:9></a> There is a passage or two important to cite, as regards tradition and apostolic succession.<a name=68:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I must give the reader a few more quotations from the Fathers as to this Lent, which is not in scripture, says the author, in which he is surely perfectly right, but is observed by tradition from the apostles.<a name=68:11></a> The Romans in the fourth or fifth century observed Saturday as a fast, and the Easterns and many of the Africans dined and ate as usual, and did not think of fasting.<a name=68:12></a> A hot Roman in St.<a name=68:13></a> Augustine's time attacked all the churches for not following the Roman custom.<a name=68:14></a> It was alleged, as the origin of the custom, that Peter, having to contend with Simon Magus, fasted along with all the Roman church on Saturday.<a name=68:15></a> If he did, I am sure it was a very godly and excellent thought and act for that time; hence the Romans did it every Saturday, when there was no Simon Magus at all.<a name=68:16></a> St.<a name=68:17></a> Augustine wrote a letter to a presbyter, Casnelanus, on this hot-headed Roman's book.<a name=68:18></a> He gives a pleasant reply enough to the Simon Magus reason, that, if he was a figure of the devil as they said, they would have that work every day of the week.<a name=68:19></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in replying to this we have from him general remarks on fasts which touch our present point of tradition.<a name=69:1></a> He says, it was the opinion of the most, that it was a mere Roman custom in reference to Peter's conflict with Simon Magus.<a name=69:2></a> "But if," he continues, "it be answered, James taught this at Jerusalem, John at Ephesus, others in other places, which Peter taught at Rome, that is, that men should fast the Saturday, but that other lands had deviated from this doctrine, and that Rome had remained firm in it; and, on the contrary, it is replied, that rather certain places of the West, among which is Rome, have not kept what the apostles delivered, but that the lands of the East, whence the gospel itself began to be preached, have continued, without ever varying, in what was delivered by all the apostles along with Peter, that they should not fast on the Sabbath (Saturday), that dispute is interminable, generating strifes, not finishing questions.<a name=69:3></a>" -- (Augustine, Ep.<a name=69:4></a> 36).<a name=69:5></a> And then he says that the unity of the faith was the point, for that the glory of the church, according to the psalm, was within: "The king's daughter is all glorious within"; that the observance was only the garments, and that she was in golden fringes, clothed around with variety: so the Vulgate, <i>circumcincta varietate</i>, after the Seventy.<a name=69:6></a> -- Psalm 44 (Hebrews 45).<a name=69:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What a testimony this bright light (as the author alleges, and justly, compared with much of the Fathers) affords of the certainty of tradition, and about fasting, and about Roman tradition too!<a name=69:8></a> It was a source of interminable disputes, he says.<a name=69:9></a> In the same letter we have another statement, which I will quote, on the point: "But since we have not found, as I have above remarked, in the evangelical and apostolic letters, which properly belong to the revelation of the New Testament, that it is clearly prescribed that fasts should be observed on any certain days, and therefore, that thing also, like many others which it is difficult to enumerate, has found in the garments of the daughter of the king, that is the church, room for variety, I will tell you what the revered Ambrose answered me when I asked him about this.<a name=69:10></a>" And then he relates how his mother was uneasy, because at Milan they did not fast the same days as at Rome; and was she to follow the custom of her city, or that of Milan where she then was?<a name=69:11></a> Ambrose, a light too among the Fathers, told her he could not teach her better than he practised -- a good deal to say too, if he went beyond fasts; and so she was to do at Milan as they did at Milan, and to do at Rome, in such matters, as they did at Rome.<a name=69:12></a> So Augustine recommends in the beginning of the letter: "In those things, concerning which divine scripture has settled nothing certain (and we have seen he states that it had not settled any certain day for fasting), the customs of the people of God, or the institutions of those of old <i>(majorum)</i>, are to be considered as a law.<a name=69:13></a>" This is a strange way to talk, if these are apostolic traditions too.<a name=69:14></a> We see, however, the real source of it -- following old habits which were made a law of.<a name=69:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		However, we have something about Lent itself from Augustine.<a name=70:1></a> "The quadragesimal period of fasts, indeed, has authority (that is, scriptural) both in the old books -- in the fact of Moses and Elias -- and from the gospel, because the Lord fasted so many days, shewing the gospel not to depart from the law and the prophets.<a name=70:2></a> In the person of Moses, namely, the law, in the person of Elias the prophets are found .<a name=70:3></a>.<a name=70:4></a>.<a name=70:5></a> .<a name=70:6></a> In what part of the year, therefore, could the observation of quadragesima be established more suitably than on the confines of, and close to, the Lord's passion?<a name=70:7></a>" And then he shews many wonderful mysteries in the number 40.<a name=70:8></a> But where is the apostolic tradition here?<a name=70:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But we have something more from the Fathers on quadragesima.<a name=70:10></a> We have seen Irenaeus telling us that some fasted one day, some two, some several, some forty hours continuously.<a name=70:11></a> Now, this last is the real secret of this number forty.<a name=70:12></a> Tertullian is a Father who lived in the end of the second century, an upright and able man; so that the famous Cyprian used to call him "the master," saying, Bring me the books of the master.<a name=70:13></a> This was the famous Cyprian who wrote a celebrated book about the unity of the church; though he would not yield to Rome on what both thought a vital point, namely, re-baptizing heretics.<a name=70:14></a> But this Cyprian tells us that the church in his day <i>(Cyprian.<a name=70:15></a> de Lapsis)</i> was corrupt to the last degree; that professing Christians were bent upon money-making, men luxurious in their habits, women painting their faces and adorning their hair, cheating going on in a shameful way, marriages with heathens taking place, bishops leaving their sees and flocks to carry on secular affairs, and making long journeys to gain money, not helping their hungry brethren, but seeking large fortunes, seizing on property by insidious frauds, and employing usury to enrich themselves.<a name=70:16></a> In other treatises he insists on the evil state of Christendom.<a name=70:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such a state of things seemed to have moved Tertullian, who lived just before Cyprian, and driven him (Jerome says it was the envy the Roman clergy bore - to him) to believe in the rhapsodies of Montanus and his two prophetesses of Phrygia, who were much stricter in their lives and fastings.<a name=71:1></a> The pope was on the point of receiving them too (already acknowledging is the term used), when a certain Praxeas, afterwards a famous heretic, came to Rome, and put the pope off it, who then excommunicated and rejected them.<a name=71:2></a> Our famous Tertullian would not give them up, and said they were rejected, not because of the spirit they alleged they had, but because of the fasts they gave themselves up to.<a name=71:3></a> However, this led him to say something of these fasts; and from him we learn that the Catholic party had their quadragesimal fasts from this -- the forty hours that Christ passed, as was alleged, in the grave; and that the scriptural authority (for none of them knew anything of apostolic tradition) they had for it was this: "When the Bridegroom shall be taken away, then shall they fast in those days"; and that as Christ was taken away till His resurrection, therefore they fasted these forty hours -- a curious reason, by the bye, for doing so, when He was, according-to this theory, restored to them.<a name=71:4></a> But let that pass.<a name=71:5></a> Here we have, from the two earliest Fathers who speak of it (Irenaeus and Tertullian), the original of quadragesima, that is, forty.<a name=71:6></a>

		But you shall have, reader, a specimen from history also.<a name=71:7></a> After relating what we have stated as to the observation of Easter, and that the Quartodecimans (the Asiatics who kept it the third day after the fourteenth of the moon) alleged that John had taught them; and the Romans boast that they had received their way from Peter and Paul, but that neither could bring a writing to prove it (he does not seem to have valued oral tradition much), he goes on to speak of Lent.<a name=71:8></a> Socrates, lib.<a name=71:9></a> 5, c.<a name=71:10></a> 22.<a name=71:11></a> "For these who are of the same faith, the same differ among themselves in rites.<a name=71:12></a> It will not therefore be out of place to add somewhat about the various rites of the churches.<a name=71:13></a> First, therefore, those fasts which are kept before Easter you will find differently kept among different people; for those who are at Rome fast three weeks continuously, except the sabbath and the Lord's day (it is a question whether this does not apply to Novatians).<a name=71:14></a> Those who are in Illyria, and throughout Achaia, and those who live in Alexandria, fast six weeks before Easter, and call that the quadragesimal fast.<a name=71:15></a> Others, again, follow a different custom from that.<a name=71:16></a> They begin their fast the seventh week before Easter, and, fasting three only of five days with intervals, call the time nothing the less quadragesimal; and I cannot but wonder why, although they differ among themselves about the numbers of days, they still call it by the same name of quadragesimal.<a name=71:17></a>"

		"But of this appellation each different person, according to his own invention, gives a different reason: for not only in days alone, but also in abstinence from foods, they are found to differ.<a name=72:1></a> For some, indeed, abstain altogether from eating what has had life; others eat fish alone of such as have had life; some, with fishes, eat also of birds, affirming that they also are formed out of water, according to Moses; some abstain from fruit of trees, and from eggs; some eat only bread; others do not use even this.<a name=72:2></a> Some, fasting to the ninth hour, eat without distinction of every kind of food afterwards.<a name=72:3></a> There are other observances, again, in different nations, and innumerable causes are alleged for them; and since no one can produce a written precept concerning this matter, it appears that the apostles left to the choice and will of every one that each one might do what is good, neither from fear nor necessity.<a name=72:4></a>" What a certainty of apostolical tradition we have here!<a name=72:5></a> Sozomen gives the same accounts.<a name=72:6></a> Lib.<a name=72:7></a> 7, c.<a name=72:8></a> 19.<a name=72:9></a> Cassian, too, tells us, as others state (I have not his works), the same thing.<a name=72:10></a> For a long time there were only thirty-six days' fast, even when six weeks or forty-two days were kept; because they never fasted on the Lord's day, till at last either Gregory the Great or Gregory II (in the close, that is, of the sixth, or beginning of the eighth, century, for it is disputed which) added Ash-Wednesday and the three following days to make it forty.<a name=72:11></a> Think of an apostolic tradition, arranged seven hundred years after Christ, and grown from forty hours to forty days, and all the original reasons gone!<a name=72:12></a>

		But I have yet one extract more from this same Cassian, for which I am also indebted to another.<a name=73:1></a> Cassian was a monk, founded monasteries and nunneries, was ordained deacon by Chrysostom, Patriarch of Constantinople, and made priest by Innocent, pope of Rome.<a name=73:2></a> He will give us a sounder idea, perhaps, of this apostolic tradition.<a name=73:3></a> "It is, therefore, indeed to be remarked that, as long as the perfection of that primitive church remained inviolable, this observance of quadragesima (Lent) did not exist at all; but when the multitude of the faithful, abandoning that apostolic devotion, daily gave themselves up to their wealth, etc.<a name=73:4></a>, it then pleased the body of priests, that men, bound by secular cares, and almost ignorant of continence or compunction, should be recalled to holy work by canonical obligation of fasting, and compel them by the necessity of a legal tenth (thirty-six days is tenth of 360, or nearly a year )".<a name=73:5></a>

		I am now going to quote something in favour of what the author says; for you may generally find in the Fathers both sides of anything, except the truth itself.<a name=73:10></a> Jerome says (he is writing to Marcella against the Montanists, who had three Lents) that one Lent in the year is observed, according to the tradition of the apostles, and says just that much in passing.<a name=73:11></a> Leo calls it the apostolical institution of a forty days' fast, which the apostles instituted by the direction of the Holy Ghost.<a name=73:12></a> But then Jerome also says (to shew what a solid thing apostolic laws founded on tradition were in those days), "But I think you should be briefly put in mind, that ecclesiastical traditions are so to be observed (especially those which are not in opposition to the faith)" (how much such a reserve shews he could have thought them apostolic!<a name=73:13></a>) "as they have been delivered by our ancestors.<a name=73:14></a> But let each province abound in its own way as of thinking, and consider the precepts of their ancestors' apostolic laws"!<a name=73:15></a> Epist.<a name=73:16></a> 52, Ed.<a name=73:17></a> Benedict.<a name=73:18></a> 71, Ed.<a name=73:19></a> Veron.<a name=73:20></a>

		As to Leo, Pagi (a very learned and highly-esteemed Roman Catholic commentator on Baronius's Annals, and another) tells us that Leo was used to call everything an apostolic law which he found either in the practice of his own church, or decreed in the archives of his predecessors, Damasus and Siricius.<a name=74:1></a> (Pagi, Critic.<a name=74:2></a> in Baron.<a name=74:3></a> an.<a name=74:4></a> 67, note 15.<a name=74:5></a>) I use another's quotation in this instance also.<a name=74:6></a>

		You have now, reader, the authorities for Lent being proved by apostolic tradition, and for the Romish assertion to that effect.<a name=74:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I turn to the Lord's day, the other example selected by the author; it is old battle-ground.<a name=74:8></a> My answer to this is easy, a lighter and a happier task.<a name=74:9></a> It is always distinguished in the early church from the sabbath, which invariably means Saturday.<a name=74:10></a> As regards the law, the change of the whole system involved the abolition of the Jewish sabbath.<a name=74:11></a> The Jewish sabbath was the sign of their covenant; but this was broken on their part, and gone, and buried on God's part in Christ's grave.<a name=74:12></a> The sabbath, which was the public sign of it, Christ passed in the grave.<a name=74:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		No establishment of any form of relationship with God took place under Moses without the sabbath being anew introduced -- a very remarkable fact; and in Ezekiel 20: 12 it is said, "And I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am Jehovah that sanctify them.<a name=74:14></a>" Hence these sabbaths could not be preserved as a Jewish sabbath, according to the commandments; because, when once Christ was crucified, God did not sanctify the Jewish people any longer.<a name=74:15></a> This the Lord shewed beforehand, over and over again during His ministry, in the way He acted and spoke on the sabbath days.<a name=74:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, further, the sabbath was the sign of the rest of the creation; and, sin having entered into the world, and man having rejected Jesus who had come into its sorrow, there could be no rest of creation in connection with the first Adam.<a name=74:17></a> So "If they shall enter into my rest, though the works were finished from the foundation of the world"; grace, and power, and redemption, must be the basis of rest and blessing.<a name=74:18></a> Hence, when they maliciously and unreasonably accused the Lord of not keeping the sabbath, He does not pay heed to their malice, but says (in the touching revelation of a grace which, if it could not find its rest where sin and misery were, could begin to work where all was ruined), "My Father <i>worketh</i> hitherto, and I <i>work</i>.<a name=74:19></a>" We can rest neither in sin nor sorrow, but can work in grace, where both are, and find occasion for work, if not rest, in it.<a name=74:20></a> The sabbath of the Jew, as the rest of man in creation, whatever physical mercy it may be to him as it is, could not remain spiritually as the valid sign of a state of things which was abrogated and passed away.<a name=74:21></a>

		Have we not proofs from scripture of the institution of the Lord's day not imposed as law, which would be contrary to the very nature of Christianity, but established in grace?<a name=75:13></a> The plainest.<a name=75:14></a> First, the Lord Jesus assembled on that day His disciples, and met them: two or three assembled in His name, and He in the midst of them.<a name=75:15></a> Next Lord's day He did the same thing.<a name=75:16></a> This the Gospels give.<a name=75:17></a> The Acts inform us that the disciples met on this day to break bread.<a name=75:18></a> In the Epistles the day is remarked as that in which the faithful were to lay by for the poor saints, as God had prospered them; and in the Revelation it is expressly called "the Lord's day" -- "<i>kuriake emera</i>," the apostle being peculiarly blessed on it.<a name=75:19></a>

		Such is the scriptural warrant, not for making a law, but for recognizing the Lord's day, the first day of the week, as one of worship and blessing; and so it has ever continued.<a name=76:1></a> The word of God gives it according to its unfailing perfection.<a name=76:2></a> It does not make a law of an ordinance where grace reigns, but it marks out distinctly the character and blessing of a day given us by grace, as the Lord's day, the day on which He began all things new for our eternal blessing.<a name=76:3></a> The Old Testament has, in more places than one, recognized the eighth -- that is, the first day after the old week was closed -- as the day of special blessing.<a name=76:4></a> This was a pertinent figure.<a name=76:5></a>

		You may think that this is mere Protestant abuse of authorities which are against us; but we have already seen that you are not much acquainted with them, and I shall produce the highest Romanist authority for what I say.<a name=79:3></a> The very learned Petau, a Jesuit, a man whose theological works are of standard reputation in the Romish body, after speaking of heretics, says, "Others were indeed Christians, and Catholics, and saints; but as the times then were, that mystery (of the divinity of Christ) being not yet sufficiently clearly known, they threw out some things dangerously said" -- (Peter de Trin.<a name=79:4></a>, lib.<a name=79:5></a> 1, c.<a name=79:6></a> 3, s.<a name=79:7></a> 1.<a name=79:8></a>) Poor Jerome, at a loss to maintain their orthodoxy, says, "It may have been that they have erred through simplicity <i>(simpliciter)</i>, or have written in another sense, or that by unskilled editors (copyists) their writings have been by degrees corrupted, or at least, before Arius, as a <i>mid-day demon</i>, was born, they have said things innocently and less cautiously, and which cannot escape the calumny of perverse men" -- (Hierom.<a name=79:9></a> <i>Cont.<a name=79:10></a> Ruffinum</i>, lib.<a name=79:11></a> 2, 17, Ver.<a name=79:12></a>)

		Now I have no objection to take the excuses of Jerome; but if, in such a fundamental point as the divinity of the Lord Jesus, such excuses have to be made for them, what can be said of their authority?<a name=79:13></a> This is said by Jerome, when the famous Clement of Alexandria, presbyter, and Dionysius, patriarch of Alexandria, were stated by another Father, the first to have said that the Son of God was a created being, and the latter to have fallen into Arianism, as he surely did when writing against the Sabellians; and, when it was objected against him, said he did not mean it.<a name=79:14></a> Jerome will not allow that their writings were corrupted by heretics.<a name=79:15></a> The title of this chapter of Petavius is this: "The opinions of certain of the ancients on the Trinity, who flourished in the Christian profession before the times of Arius, discordant from the Catholic rule, at least in the manner of speaking, are set forth; as of Justin Martyr, Athenagoras, Tatian, Theophilus, Irenaeus, Clemens Romanus.<a name=79:16></a>" Think of all these eminent Fathers, if we except perhaps Tatian, holding opinions contrary to the Catholic faith on the subject of the divinity of Christ, or at least expressing themselves so!<a name=79:17></a> What a comfortable security for right interpretation!<a name=79:18></a> I do not pretend that Petavius is warranted in all he says;<a href="#79:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> but if so very learned a Jesuit judges the Antenicene Fathers thus, even if some of them may be speciously defended (as the Protestant bishop Bull, and the Jesuit Zacharia, and Horsley, and Burton, have attempted to do), while some certainly cannot, what possible reliance can be placed on them?<a name=79:19></a> And remember, that it is on the capital point of the divinity of Christ.<a name=79:20></a>

		On the catholicity of the church I have already spoken.<a name=85:1></a> That the Fathers used the testimony of the church universal against heretics is quite true; nor, though not a final authority, are they to be much blamed, when it was universal.<a name=85:2></a> But we have seen they were not preserved by it themselves, nor was the church; and the question still remains, Is the Romish system in the truth?<a name=85:3></a> The Fathers, with their usual inconsistency, when not pressed by the heretics, equally declared that the scriptures alone were authority.<a name=85:4></a> They argued, and argued as it suited them.<a name=85:5></a> Thus Cyprian, against those who deserted what he belonged to, preached unity as obligatory.<a name=85:6></a> But this same Cyprian was exceedingly opposed to the pope and Romans on the re-baptizing of heretics, and wrote against the pope, and never would yield to him.<a name=85:7></a> Stephen, the said pope, urged "Let nothing be innovated on what has been handed down" <i>(traditum)</i>.<a name=85:8></a> Hereupon our good Father changes all his language.<a name=85:9></a> "Whence," he cries out, "is that tradition?<a name=85:10></a> Does it descend from the authority of the Lord<a href="#85:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> and the Gospels <i>(Evangelica)</i>, and come from the commandments and Epistles of the apostles?<a name=85:11></a> For God bears witness that these things are to be done which are written, and speaks to Joshua, the son of Nun, saying, 'The book of this law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate in it day and night, that thou mayest observe to do all things that are written therein.<a name=85:12></a>' If, therefore, it is commanded in the Gospels, or contained in the Epistles of the apostles, or the Acts, that those coming from whatever heresy should not be baptized, but only hands imposed on him in penance, let this divine and holy tradition be observed .<a name=85:13></a>.<a name=85:14></a>.<a name=85:15></a> .<a name=85:16></a> What obstinacy is that!<a name=85:17></a> [in the pope, remember.<a name=85:18></a>] What presumption to prefer human tradition to a divine disposition, and not take notice that God is indignant and angry, as often as human tradition sets aside, and passes by, divine precepts, as He cries out and says by Esaias the prophet, 'This people honour me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.<a name=85:19></a> But in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.<a name=85:20></a>' Also the Lord, in the Gospel, reproving and blaming, lays it down, and says, 'Ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may establish your tradition,' mindful of which precept the blessed apostle Paul himself also warns and instructs, saying, 'If any one teach otherwise, and do not acquiesce in the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and His doctrine, he is puffed up with pride, knowing nothing: from such turn away.<a name=85:21></a>'" -- (Ep.<a name=85:22></a> 74, ed.<a name=85:23></a> Oxon.<a name=85:24></a>) Here every tradition is to be judged by scripture.<a name=85:25></a> <i>O si sic omnia</i>!<a name=85:26></a> and this is a pope!<a name=85:27></a>

		The truth is, the Fathers were men, and reasoned as it suited them.<a name=86:1></a> The scriptures are the word of God, and speak plainly.<a name=86:2></a> "He taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.<a name=86:3></a>" But the letter of our good prelate affords us some further and excellent advice -- "It is simple with religious and simple minds, both to lay aside error, and find and dig out the truth.<a name=86:4></a> For if we revert to the head and origin of divine tradition, human error ceases [we must remember that tradition means any doctrine delivered by word or writing]; and the principle <i>(ratione)</i> of the celestial sacraments being considered, whatever lay hid in obscurity and a cloud of darkness, it will be brought out into the light of truth.<a name=86:5></a> If a canal, which conducts water that before flowed copiously and abundantly, suddenly fails, do not men go to the fountain, that there the reason of the failure may be known -- whether, the veins being dried up, the water has dried up at the source?<a name=86:6></a> or whether, being perfect there and full, running forward, failed mid-way?<a name=86:7></a> that if it be caused by the fault of an interrupted or leaky canal, which hinders the water from flowing constantly and without interruption, the canal being re-made and strengthened, the water collected for the use and drinking of the city may be re-presented with the same richness and purity as it flows from the fountain, which now is what the priests of God, keeping the divine precepts, have to do.<a name=86:8></a> And if in any one (or any thing) the truths have tottered or vacillated, let us return to the original of the Lord, and the gospel <i>(originem Dominicam et Evangelicam)</i>, and the apostolic teaching <i>(traditionem)</i>, and let the principle of our acting spring from that whence its order and origin has sprung.<a name=86:9></a>" Here, remark, tradition does not mean what is now received; for the truth was tottering and lost, and he insists on going back from that to what was <i>originally</i> delivered.<a name=86:10></a>

		Now we have gone up to the fountain, as Cyprian recommends, and we have found a rich and inexhaustible fountain of pure water of life in the very same source which he urged men to go to.<a name=87:1></a> We have found that the canal has been choked with filth; so that, though a little water has oozed through, the result has been mud, undrinkable and contaminated -- that the little that trickled through the filth, which has gradually filled up the channel, is utterly tainted; but when the grace of God had led us to the fountain, we have found the water as pure, as fresh, as abundant as ever, and only the more delicious from having found it again.<a name=87:2></a> We have found the truth easily discovered and dug out, as Cyprian has said, once arrived at the treasures of the scriptures which God gave.<a name=87:3></a> I have already quoted from Irenaeus a passage, where he states that, if we cannot find the solution of all that is in scripture, we are not to look for another God, but leave these things to God, because the scriptures are perfect as spoken by the word of God and His Spirit.<a name=87:4></a>

		We see at once here, that to put the Manicheans out of court, he insists, that when he attempted to use the gospel to make him receive Manichaeus (Manes) and his doctrine, it could not take effect, because he had believed in the gospel by means of the very Catholics who condemned Manichaeus.<a name=90:1></a> Now it is a very foolish and bad sentence; but is merely a reasoning used in an argument <i>ad hominem</i> to frustrate the Manichean by taking the ground from under his feet; and it supposes a person refusing to believe the very gospel he appealed to, and then insisting he could not use the gospel against Catholics, because it was through Catholics he had believed.<a name=90:2></a> It is no business of mine to defend Augustine, though he were a bright testimony to the grace of God.<a name=90:3></a> His reasonings are often weak and foolish enough, and admitted to be so by Romanists, and I may almost say by himself, for he excuses himself as writing in haste, and admits that, not having been able to meet Manes in the plain sense of scripture, he had turned it into allegories.<a name=90:4></a> But the close of the chapter shews clearly what he meant.<a name=90:5></a> He had been led to believe the gospel by the preaching of Catholics, and, thus led to it by them, he could not read it as condemning them -- an argument which has no force.<a name=90:6></a> It is in no way a quiet dogmatic sentence as it is presented.<a name=90:7></a> It is to be hoped that he did not mean that when, through the instrumentality of the preaching of the Catholics, he had been brought to believe in it as the word of God, he still held it merely by their authority; because if he really believed it to be God's word, and that he had really faith <i>in it as such</i>, however brought to that conviction, he must believe it, because <i>God had spoken</i> it: otherwise there was no divine faith.<a name=90:8></a>

		But I take higher ground than shewing it was a mere argumentative phrase to excuse Augustine.<a name=91:1></a> If the principle be the sober judgment of Augustine, that he would not believe unless on the authority of the church, this is not believing because God has spoken, but because the church had.<a name=91:2></a> If one tells me something, and <i>another</i> accredits him, and I believe the first because the other declares what he says is true, it is clear I do not believe the former, though I believe the fact he relates; for I do so because I trust another, not him.<a name=91:3></a> That is, if I believe the gospel <i>because</i> the church authenticates it, it is because I do <i>not</i> believe it without: that is, God's saying it is insufficient.<a name=91:4></a> I do not believe God in it at all.<a name=91:5></a> There is no faith in God's word.<a name=91:6></a>

		The truth is, Augustine was first attracted by Ambrose's preaching, by his kindness and eloquence, and began to doubt his own Manicheanism; but he was converted by the scriptures, and established in the faith by the scriptures.<a name=92:1></a> "Therefore," he says, "as we were infirm in finding the truth by mere reason, and the authority of the holy letters was needful for us, I began now to believe that thou wouldst in nowise have given so excellent an authority to the scriptures in all lands, unless thou hadst written that by it I should believe in thee, and by it I should seek thee.<a name=92:2></a>" This accordingly he did, passing through much conflict; and at last abandoning himself to tears under a fig-tree, he heard a voice saying, "Take and read, take and read"; and he arose, took up the Epistles to look at the first thing he opened at, and found a passage which was his deliverance.<a name=92:3></a> Such is his own account in his Confessions when he is relating the facts, not reasoning with Manicheans.<a name=92:4></a> He was not very nice in reasoning with these.<a name=92:5></a> He wrote a book against them early in his career; and when he could not make any proper sense out of the scriptures literally, or none could be made (so he says), he turned it into an allegory to get out of the scrape, hoping he might do better afterwards; and so, indeed, he tried to do in a treatise on Genesis according to the letter.<a name=92:6></a>

I add here, Cyril, in his catechism, shews that it was a part of baptism instituted after the analogy of Christ's, who received the Holy Ghost after his. It was always done immediately. See "Life of Basil," by Amphilochus Dionysius, St. Ambrose, Opatus, etc. In confirmation of what I have said of the Greek church, a canon is cited. A presbyter may not sign infants in the presence of the bishop, unless, indeed, he has been desired by the bishop to do it. Infants were confirmed at their baptism.

In the Romish system they have life by baptism. The Vulgate reads, Ye shall have no life; still, as addressed to Jews, as it was, the force is the same. For it was not by the Eucharist they were to get life, but by baptism.

		<a class="footnote" name="#103:f2"><sup>++</sup></a>The Vulgate, in all these passages, has unequivocally corrupted the text (at least translated it untruly), but it changes nothing of the substance of the argument.

		As regards a mouse eating it, I am not fond of such arguments; because, though I do not believe lifeless bread to be my living Lord, save as faith realizes Him, yet it is a memorial of Him, and there is no profit in irreverent associations.<a name=104:1></a> Yet you have in nothing met the argument in the smallest degree.<a name=104:2></a> According to your system, the body, blood, soul, and divinity of Christ are there; yet it cannot help itself against a mouse.<a name=104:3></a> The argument has the same bearing as Isaiah's.<a name=104:4></a> The idolater makes a fire with part of a tree, warms himself, roasts at it, and says of the rest, It is a god, and worships it.<a name=104:5></a> Here a mouse eats it; it is turned into corruption; and you adore the rest as God.<a name=104:6></a> The argument may be a painful one, but it is complete.<a name=104:7></a> He cannot deliver himself, says Isaiah: a deceived heart has turned him aside; he cannot say, I <i>have a lie in my right hand</i>.<a name=104:8></a> When the Lord says, "Do this in remembrance of me," it was saying it was a memorial of Him when He was gone, not His presence.<a name=104:9></a> But there is no life in the wafer.<a name=104:10></a> It is monstrous to say it is God, and eat it literally, let Fathers say what they may.<a name=104:11></a> It is not a living Christ; were it so, it were no sacrifice either, nor shedding of blood.<a name=104:12></a> I live by the life of a living Christ; I feed, commemoratively, on a dying one (such as, blessed be God, He can be no more, and is not now).<a name=104:13></a> Hence the cup, and drinking the cup, are essential to the import of the sacrament, and that the blood be nowhere else; for, if not shed, there is no remission.<a name=104:14></a>

		And now mark the amazing import of this point.<a name=105:1></a> The Romanist as such does not partake of the cup.<a name=105:2></a> The reason, as is alleged, that it is all the same, is what is called the doctrine of concomitancy -- that each element contains all -- that in the bread the body, blood, soul, and divinity of Christ are all found.<a name=105:3></a> Now, if the blood be in the body, there is no sacrifice, no redemption, no remission of sins.<a name=105:4></a> Without <i>shedding</i> of blood, says the Holy Ghost (Hebrews 9), there is no <i>remission</i>.<a name=105:5></a> Now, if the blood be in the body, it is not shed.<a name=105:6></a> That is, the poor Romanist -- and with it I do not reproach him but what calls itself the Catholic church, and the enemy of souls -- the poor Romanist has the sacrament of there being no redemption, or no remission of sins; for, as he receives it, His blood is yet in the body.<a name=105:7></a> Think how the enemy has mocked his poor soul!<a name=105:8></a> No doubt the Fathers spoke of it as the flesh and blood of Christ; but they say plainly now -- I repeat I do not cite them as of weight, for there is no one less worthy of authority than they -- but, as an historical fact, they say sufficient (not certainly to shew that they were not superstitious enough, but) that superstition had not travelled in five centuries as far as it had in fifteen.<a name=105:9></a> It went faster with the people than even the clergy, in some respects, for they brought in their heathen habits.<a name=105:10></a> Of this anon.<a name=105:11></a> I will quote enough from them to shew that, when it suited them in <i>argument</i>, they say the contrary of Romish doctrine: it is very possible, when it suits them or their imagination is at work, they teach it too.<a name=105:12></a> It just shews what they are worth.<a name=105:13></a> The mere saying, "flesh and blood," means nothing.<a name=105:14></a>

		But to the point.<a name=106:1></a> First; when the controversies as to the two natures of Christ were on foot, and yet earlier, on the possibility of His taking flesh, which the Gnostic heretics denied, they insist on the <i>bread being there</i> when He is spiritually or divinely present, as a proof that the two things can be together.<a name=106:2></a> Here their whole point was, that it was still bread; just as His flesh, as a living man, was true flesh, which the heretics denied.<a name=106:3></a> Thus Tertullian: "He made the bread, received and distributed to His disciples His body, saying, This is my body, that is, the figure of my body; but it would not have been a figure unless the body was truly such; for an empty thing, which is a phantasm, cannot have a figure.<a name=106:4></a>" The reader must know that early heretics denied that Christ had a real body: Tertullian argues, from the Eucharist being a figure of His body, that the body must be real.<a name=106:5></a> Irenaeus argues in the same way, and is very positive as to the bread being there after the consecration, of which he speaks: "For when the bread, which is from the earth, receives the invocation of God, it is no longer common bread, but the Eucharist, consisting of two things, earthly and heavenly; so our bodies," etc.<a name=106:6></a>

		So Augustine (after saying that people said Christ was immolated at Easter, and constantly, though He never was but once long ago, and could be but once) says, "For if the sacrament had not a certain similitude of these things whereof they are sacraments, they would not be sacraments at all; but from this similitude they receive, for the most part, even the name of the things themselves.<a name=106:7></a>" What can be plainer?<a name=106:8></a> "For the Lord did not hesitate to say, This is my body, when He gave the sign of His body.<a name=106:9></a>" "The feast at which He commended and delivered to His disciples the figure of His body and of His blood" (on Psalm 3).<a name=106:10></a> "He who abides not in Christ, and in whom Christ does not abide, beyond all doubt neither eats His flesh nor drinks His blood, although he eats and drinks for judgment on himself the sacrament of so great a thing" (in Joann.<a name=106:11></a> Tract.<a name=106:12></a> 26: 18).<a name=106:13></a> Chrysostom is quoted also, as saying, "Before the bread is sanctified we call it bread; but, divine grace sanctifying it through the ministry of the priest, it is freed from the name of bread, and judged worthy of the appellation of the Lord's body, although the nature of bread remains in it" (Epist.<a name=106:14></a> ad Caesarium).<a name=106:15></a>

		These may suffice to shew that, rapidly as superstition grew, four or five centuries (that is, as long ago as Edward III) had not sufficed to obliterate the original doctrine of the church of God.<a name=107:1></a> It was made a dogma of the church only in the thirteenth century, in the Lateran Council, under Innocent III, the bloody instigator of the crusades against the Albigenses in the south of France, and the establisher of the Inquisition.<a name=107:2></a> In the tenth it was openly disputed, many prelates supporting the writer; and in the ninth was openly maintained, and the author not condemned as heretical at all, that transubstantiation did not take place.<a name=107:3></a> The reader may remark that several of the quotations I have given are from writers whom the author has quoted, shewing, when speaking soberly, how little they attributed to their own words the force which is attributed to them; or rather they spoke rhetorically about it in discourse, and shewed at other times it was only rhetoric.<a name=107:4></a> Again, what a ground to put our faith upon in order to receive it!<a name=107:5></a>

		But I will add some other passages of the Fathers, shewing distinctly, as a learned Romanist has admitted, that, up to Chrysostom, the church did not really hold transubstantiation as a doctrine, however rhetorically individuals may have spoken.<a name=107:6></a> I attach no kind of importance to their opinion but historically, as the Romanists lean on them; it shews what a broken reed his way of assuring true doctrine is, and that is our point now.<a name=107:7></a>

		The passage of Justin Martyr quoted by the author proves the contrary of that for which he cites it.<a name=107:8></a> Justin treats the Eucharist as bread, wine, and water, and as nothing else literally.<a name=107:9></a> The author has not, as so often has occurred, given the whole passage.<a name=107:10></a> "This food," he begins.<a name=107:11></a> What food?<a name=107:12></a> Hear Justin.<a name=107:13></a> "Those called among us deacons give to each of those present to partake of the bread, and wine, and water, over which thanks have been given, and carry it away to the absent, and this food is called among us Eucharist .<a name=107:14></a>.<a name=107:15></a>.<a name=107:16></a> .<a name=107:17></a> For we do not receive these things as common bread nor as common drink; but in the same way.<a name=107:18></a>" (This the author has entirely changed; I suppose, as usual, quoting from a text-book.<a name=107:19></a> How honest they are -- that is, the instructors of the Romish body -- we have seen by this time.<a name=107:20></a>) "As by the word of God, Jesus Christ, our Saviour, being made flesh, had flesh and blood for our salvation, so also the nourishment by which flesh and blood, through change [into them], are nourished, over which thanks have been given, through prayer of the word which is from Him, we have been taught to be the flesh and blood of that Jesus made flesh.<a name=107:21></a>" Now here, whatever it was to their faith, it was really and substantially bread, and wine, and water, such as <i>nourished</i> the natural body.<a name=107:22></a> No Romanist could say that bread and wine and water were given to be partaken of by each person present, nor that they took what nourished their body, on being changed into it.<a name=107:23></a> Hence the author, or his text-book, omits it.<a name=107:24></a>

		Theodoret, in answering the Eutychians who held that there was only one nature in Christ, says, "He that called His own natural body wheat and bread, and gave it the name of a vine, He also honoured the visible symbols or elements with the name of His body and blood, not changing their nature, but adding grace to nature" (Dial.<a name=108:1></a> 1, tom.<a name=108:2></a> 4, page 17).<a name=108:3></a> The Eutychian <i>heretic</i> Eranistes (Dial.<a name=108:4></a> 2, page 85, ed.<a name=108:5></a> Schulze 4: 126) says, "As the symbols of the Lord's body and blood are one thing before the invocation of the priest, but after invocation are changed, and become another thing, so also the body of our Lord, after its assumption, was changed into the divine substance.<a name=108:6></a>" Theodoret replies, "Thou art taken in thine own net which thou hast made; for neither do the mystical symbols depart from their own nature after consecration, for they remain in their former substance, figure, and form," <i>ousias kai tou schematos kai tou eidous</i>.<a name=108:7></a> This is most unequivocal.<a name=108:8></a> Indeed, the controversy with the Eutychians and Monophysites, who confounded the divine and human natures in Christ, proves clearly that transubstantiation was not believed in.<a name=108:9></a> They used the fact of its being still bread and wine against the Eutychian doctrine, as they had against the Gnostics the fact of their being material creatures.<a name=108:10></a>

		But some of the points are to be cleared up.<a name=113:15></a> First, it is exceedingly doubtful if Peter ever was at Rome.<a name=113:16></a> Scripture never shews him to have been there, and it seems to me impossible to reconcile what it does state with his having been there.<a name=113:17></a> I admit respectable writers think he was, but scripture speaks only of Paul.<a name=113:18></a> Peter certainly did not found the church there.<a name=113:19></a> There were many Christians before any apostle was there, and Paul was the first that went.<a name=113:20></a> In the free exercise of their ministry, as the Holy Ghost has recorded it and thought proper to give it to us, no apostle founded the church at Rome.<a name=113:21></a> Paul, who preached the full and blessed gospel to the Gentiles (which was not Peter's office, as we know he was apostle of the circumcision, or of the Jews) -- Paul went there as a prisoner.<a name=113:22></a> The gospel was never apostolically in Rome, save as in prison.<a name=113:23></a> It is possible that Peter closed his life there; but this is the utmost that can be historically admitted, because we have a divine account of what passed till then, and his presence is incompatible with that account.<a name=113:24></a> History is silent for a century afterwards, and then every country sought to have it believed to have been visited, and its chief see founded, by an apostle or apostolic man.<a name=113:25></a> John lived at Ephesus, yet he certainly did not found the church there, as we know from scripture.<a name=113:26></a> So history alleges that Peter founded the church at Antioch -- a statement entirely unfounded, because we have, in the Acts of the Apostles, a long account of the church at Antioch; and all that Peter had to do with it was to divide it, when it existed already, by leading away all the Jews by his dissimulation, so that Paul had to resist him to his face.<a name=113:27></a> It is just as little true that he founded the church of Rome.<a name=113:28></a> We have Christians at Rome two years at least before Paul went there, and Paul there two years, who began working with the Jews; and none of them, Christians, Jews, or Paul, know anything at all of Peter at Rome.<a name=113:29></a> He may have visited Rome to see the Jewish Christians after this, and been martyred there, but that is the utmost possible.<a name=113:30></a>

		The great and dreadful evil of this doctrine is this: the grace of the gospel shews us two great things: first, that Christ has wrought so great and glorious a work, that I can go directly to the Father, in His name, certain that He hears me, and have boldness to enter into the holiest by His blood; secondly, that Christ in His rich grace came down here, was tempted in all points as we are, without sin -- that He is touched with the feeling of my infirmities, and knows, having learned here below, how to speak a word in season to him that is weary.<a name=122:1></a> He has shrunk from no suffering, no humiliation, that I may have confidence in His love, and readiness to help.<a name=122:2></a> The invocation of saints and angels comes to deny all this.<a name=122:3></a> He is too high, too exalted; His heart not tender enough!<a name=122:4></a> Saints who never shared our place are to be more trusted; the tender mercies of the Virgin Mary, who never shed her blood for me, is to be more trusted.<a name=122:5></a> It is all shameful dishonour put upon Christ's grace and tenderness.<a name=122:6></a> I know no one so kind, so condescending, who is come down to the poor sinner, as He.<a name=122:7></a> I trust His love more than I do Mary's, or any saint's; not merely His power as God, but the tenderness of His heart as man -- none ever shewed such, or had such, or proved it so well.<a name=122:8></a> None entered into my sorrows, none took a part in them, as He; none understands my heart so well; none has inspired me with such confidence in His.<a name=122:9></a> Let others go to saints and angels, if they like; I trust Jesus' kindness more.<a name=122:10></a> If it is said, He is too high, I answer, He became a man that we might know His tenderness; and He is not changed.<a name=122:11></a> And why go to them?<a name=122:12></a> Why, in Jesus' name, not go straight to the Father?<a name=122:13></a> The need of all this troop of mediators only shews that men do not believe the gospel.<a name=122:14></a> They cannot go to God Himself.<a name=122:15></a> Now Christ has brought us <i>to God</i>; suffering, the just for the unjust, He has brought us to a God of love, our Father, having put away our sins.<a name=122:16></a> Rome would turn us out again, to leave us trembling at the doors of the saints.<a name=122:17></a> I would rather go to God Himself.<a name=122:18></a> He, I know, loves me; He has given His Son for me.<a name=122:19></a> Which of the saints has done that?<a name=122:20></a> As to angels, they are ministering spirits, sent forth to minister to them who shall be heirs of salvation.<a name=122:21></a> Looking to them is treated as apostasy in scripture.<a name=122:22></a>

		If you will have Fathers, here is a quotation for you -- Ambrose, on Romans 1: "Men are accustomed, when feeling shame for having neglected God, to use a miserable excuse, saying that by them (the saints, etc.<a name=123:1></a>) they can go to God, as by counts (officers of the court) people go to the king.<a name=123:2></a> Away then!<a name=123:3></a> Is any one so mad, or so unmindful of his salvation, as that he should give the honour of the king to a count, when, if any should be found to treat of such a matter, they would rightly be condemned of high treason?<a name=123:4></a> And so they think they are not guilty who defer the honour of the name of God to a creature, as if anything more could be kept for God.<a name=123:5></a> For therefore men go to the king by tribunes or counts, because the king, after all, is but a man, and is ignorant to whom he ought to trust the common weal; but to find favour with God, before whom nothing is hid, for He knows the merits of all -- there is not need of one to plead for us <i>(suffragator)</i>, but of a devout mind.<a name=123:6></a>" I might quote many more from Origen, using not <i>latria</i>, but honour and do homage to.<a name=123:7></a> So Eusebius from Dionysius I reverence the true God alone, and none else.<a name=123:8></a> So continually in the early conflicts with the heathen; and the well-known passage of the epistle on Polycarp's martyrdom, when the Gentiles refused his body, lest they should do homage to him; "Not knowing," they say, "that we could neither abandon Christ, who suffered for the salvation of the whole world of the saved, nor reverence any other.<a name=123:9></a> For to Him, being indeed Son of God, we do homage; but martyrs, as disciples and imitators of the Lord, we love deservedly, because of the great love they have shewn to their own king and leader, with whom we would be partakers and fellow-disciples.<a name=123:10></a>"

		The country is in progress towards these two forms of evil.<a name=151:1></a> The National Schools in Ireland are founded on the avowed principle, that it was a vital defect to have the scriptures read in them, and this professedly to please the priests.<a name=151:2></a> A lay tribunal has decided that clergymen are not bound to hold the scriptures to be inspired, and that if they do not contravene articles made for another state of the church, they may teach anything they like; that is, that the church is no guardian of the truth at all.<a name=151:3></a> On the other hand, when men are subjected to the stultified fatuity that a red gown is like the Holy Ghost, there is no way of meeting such imbecility in public service,<a href="#151:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> because there is a rubric attached to the liturgy, the expression of patience, ill-advised or not, at the time when men were emerging from these things, which permits what was done in the second year of Edward VI.<a name=151:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, it is not the evil I am judging here.<a name=151:5></a> If men like red gowns, I am sorry they do not instead love to worship God in spirit and in truth; but what I notice, what is fatal in its character is, that while the word of God is surrendered, and men are judicially authorized to give it up, there is no autonomy, no power, avowedly no power, to stand against or remove evil.<a name=151:6></a> The authorities of the national body seek to tide it over with the power of evil: but there is no faithfulness to God: and we have Father<a href="#151:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a> Ignatius at the Episcopal gatherings as a deacon of the Church of England, and having a right to be there; and we have Colensos and Williamses openly setting aside the word with impunity.<a name=151:7></a> Neither can be met, neither can be dealt with as evil.<a name=151:8></a> They are authoritatively or judicially accepted; there is no intrinsic power at all to meet evil.<a name=151:9></a> I do not doubt the faithfulness of the Lord; I have no fear; I hold it to be a time of great blessing for faith; I believe the Lord is at hand.<a name=151:10></a> But it is sorrowful when what, in some sense at least, was the professed seat of righteousness declares its incapacity to remove or resist evil.<a name=151:11></a> If it be so, we are on the way to judgment.<a name=151:12></a> The aristocratic mind tends to popery; the popular to infidelity.<a name=151:13></a> Ecclesiastical authorities are powerless against the former; they are the chief abettors of the latter.<a name=151:14></a> Truth remains, blessed be God, always itself, and grace cannot fail.<a name=151:15></a>

		As I have spoken of these two forms of evil, let me add a few words on them before I formally take up the book which has given occasion to these lines.<a name=152:1></a> It is, as regards the true object of these remarks, the best judgment on the book.<a name=152:2></a> I am greatly confirmed in the conviction, that at the root of Romanism lies infidelity, not of course in the gross form of denying Christianity in its fundamental truths, or the historical basis of Christianity, but in the annulling those truths on which the blessing of the soul depends, or their application to it.<a name=152:3></a> It is a sensuous religion, fills the imagination with gorgeous ceremonies, noble buildings, fine music, stately processions.<a name=152:4></a> It feeds it with legends and the poetry of antiquity; but it gives no holy peace to the conscience -- ease it may, but not peace; and, while accrediting itself with asceticism,<a href="#152:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> it accepts for the mass of its votaries full association with the world.<a name=152:5></a> It holds sin over the conscience as a terror, and relieves from that terror by human intervention, so as to put power into man's hand -- into the hands of the priesthood.<a name=152:6></a> Looked at as a picture, it fills largely the imagination; in practice it degrades.<a name=152:7></a> Christianity and (in its true sense, whatever its shortcomings may have been) Protestantism elevate.<a name=152:8></a> I shall refer to this last in a moment: it has largely failed in result, but in its nature, as compared with Romanism, it elevates.<a name=152:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christianity brings us directly, <i>immediately</i>, to God.<a name=152:10></a> Each individual is directly, immediately, in relationship to God -- his conscience before God, his heart confidingly in His presence.<a name=152:11></a> Judaism had a priesthood, the people could not go into God's presence.<a name=152:12></a> They might receive blessings, offer offerings, celebrate God's goodness, have a law to command them; but the way into the holiest was closed by a veil: "the Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest was not yet made manifest.<a name=152:13></a>" When the Lord Jesus died, this veil was rent from top to bottom, and "we have boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way which he has consecrated through the veil, that is to say, his flesh.<a name=152:14></a>" "Having made peace by the blood of His cross.<a name=152:15></a>" "He suffered, the just for the unjust, to bring us to God"; "His blood cleanseth from all sin.<a name=152:16></a>" Hence the essence of Christianity, as applied to man, is, that the Christian goes himself, directly, personally to God -- in Christ's name, and through Christ, but himself, into the holiest, and with boldness.<a name=152:17></a> He has by Christ access through the one Spirit to the Father, the Spirit of adoption.<a name=152:18></a> This being brought nigh by the blood of Jesus characterizes Christianity in its nature.<a name=152:19></a> The holiness of God's own presence is brought to bear on the soul: "If we walk," it is said, "in the light, as he is in the light" -- yet not as fear, which repels, for we know perfect love through the gift of Jesus.<a name=152:20></a> We have boldness to enter into the holiest, that place where the presence of God Himself assures that the confidence of love will be the adoration of reverence while we go forth to the world; that the life of Jesus may be made manifest in our mortal body, the epistle (as it is said) of Christ.<a name=152:21></a> I am not discussing how far each Christian realizes it, but this is what Christianity practically is.<a name=152:22></a> He has made us kings and priests to God and His Father.<a name=152:23></a> This elevates truly.<a name=152:24></a>

		Man is not elevated by intellectual pretensions; for he never gets, nor can get, beyond himself.<a name=153:1></a> What elevates him is heart-intercourse with what is above him; what truly elevates him is heart-intercourse with God, fellowship (wondrous word!<a name=153:2></a>) with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ.<a name=153:3></a> But, even where the heart has not found its blessed home there through grace, this principle morally elevates; for it at least puts the natural conscience directly before God, and refers the soul, in its estimate of good and evil, personally and immediately to Him.<a name=153:4></a> There may be self-will and failure, but the standard of responsibility is preserved for the soul.<a name=153:5></a> I do but sketch the great principle on which I insist.<a name=153:6></a>

		Romanism, wherever it exercises its influence, has closed the veil again.<a name=153:7></a> The faithful are not reconciled to God, they cannot go into the holiest, they do not know (as they quote from Ecclesiastes with so false an application) love and hatred by all that is before them; between them and God, they have a priesthood and saints, and the Virgin Mary.<a name=153:8></a> Christianity is a divine work which, through the redemption and life of a heavenly Mediator, has brought us to God; Romanism, a system of mediators on earth and in heaven, placed between us and God, to whom we are to go, and who go for us; we are too unworthy to go ourselves.<a name=153:9></a> It sounds lowly this voluntary humility, but it shuts out the conscience from the witness of God's presence; it casts us back on our worthiness, it puts away and denies the perfect love of God as known to us (shed abroad in the heart by the Holy Ghost given to us) through Christ.<a name=153:10></a> It repudiates the blessed tender grace of Jesus, that High Priest who can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities.<a name=153:11></a> We must go to the heart of Jesus through the heart of Mary, they tell us.<a name=153:12></a> Surely I would rather trust His, blessed and honoured as she may have been and was in her own place.<a name=153:13></a> It removes me from God, to connect me immediately with creatures, however exalted, for my heart, and with sinful men, for my conscience, who are to judge of and absolve me.<a name=153:14></a> All this is degrading.<a name=153:15></a> It is the denial of Christianity, not in its original facts, but in its power and application to man.<a name=153:16></a>

		A few illustrations of what I mean.<a name=154:1></a> They hold the great facts or truths of Christianity -- the Trinity, the divinity and humanity of Christ; the atonement, so far as its sufficiency goes (not, however, as effectual substitution); that men are sinners (this also very imperfectly); and the need of regeneration, though they scorn the true force of the word.<a name=154:2></a> They hold the inspiration of the scriptures, though they have falsified them, both in adding books which every honest man knows are not genuine scriptures, and in giving a translation as the authentic scriptures.<a name=154:3></a> They own in a general way the personality and agency of the Holy Ghost.<a name=154:4></a> My object is not here to state exactly every point, but to say in general that they own the great fundamental facts of Christianity.<a name=154:5></a> It is not there that the spirit of infidelity shews itself.<a name=154:6></a>

		But the moment you come to the application of these facts to men -- to their efficacious value, all is lost.<a name=154:7></a> The scriptures are inspired, but the faithful are incapable of using them.<a name=154:8></a> In vain is it that they are addressed by God Himself through the inspired writers to the body of believers -- they must not have them but by leave of others.<a name=154:9></a> In vain is it that there is a Holy Ghost -- He does not so lead and guide individuals as that they can walk in peace and grace, and understand withal His word.<a name=154:10></a> They mock at the thought of His dwelling in believers.<a name=154:11></a> They bring the divisions and faults of believers to prove He cannot be there; that is, they use man's sin to deny God's goodness and truth, just as infidels do.<a name=154:12></a>

		Even as to the scriptures their universal question is the same as the infidel's -- How do you know them to be the scriptures?<a name=155:1></a> Their doctrine is, You must believe in them through the church: that is, the scriptures do not command faith in and by themselves, nor is man guilty if he reject them, just as the infidel says.<a name=155:2></a> God's word must be believed because God has spoken, and for no other reason, or it is not believing <i>His</i> word at all.<a name=155:3></a> Grace, no doubt, is needed for it, as for everything; but man's responsibility is there, as the Lord said, "If ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.<a name=155:4></a>" They were responsible for not receiving Him, with all ecclesiastical authority rejecting Him: so are men as to the word.<a name=155:5></a>

		Again, take Christ's intercessional mediatorship.<a name=155:14></a> Christianity presents to me that blessed One, in whom dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily; a man tempted in all points as we are, without sin; one who also can be touched with the feeling of my infirmities, who has suffered being tempted, and thus is able to succour them that are tempted.<a name=155:15></a> In a word, the Son of God Himself has descended into our sorrows and trials, and passed through them in tender gracious love, that I might confide in His sympathy and love, and know He could feel for and with me.<a name=155:16></a> Do they deny His priesthood and intercession?<a name=155:17></a> No.<a name=155:18></a> But in fact there are a crowd of mediators; above all, Mary His mother.<a name=155:19></a> And why?<a name=155:20></a> He is too high and glorious.<a name=155:21></a> Any poor man would seek a friend at court to have the king's ear; it is the heart of Mary I am to trust, and get the saints' intercession, and reach His heart through Mary's.<a name=155:22></a> The whole truth and value of Christ's intercessory love is destroyed and denied in practice.<a name=155:23></a> The saints' and Mary's intercession is trusted, their tenderness and nearness believed in, not Christ's.<a name=155:24></a> Heathenism denied the one true God the Creator (though in a certain sense owning Him as a dogma) by a multiplicity of gods in practice.<a name=155:25></a> God intervenes by a Mediator in the most perfect system of blessing, and Romanism, while admitting the mediatorship of Christ as a dogma, has denied the one true mediatorship in practice by a multiplicity of mediators.<a name=155:26></a> It is the heathenism of Christianity, that is, of the blessed truth of a redeeming Mediator.<a name=155:27></a>

		And there is another point connected with this.<a name=161:1></a> What finally led Dr.<a name=161:2></a> Newman to be satisfied with Romanism, which has confessedly a multitude of doctrines unknown to the primitive church, was the principle of development.<a name=161:3></a> He was far down the hill, no doubt, long before; but that plunged him into its waters.<a name=161:4></a> Now in the Person of Christ, and the value of His work before God, there can be no development.<a name=161:5></a> He is the same -- and so is the efficacy of His work -- yesterday, today, and for ever.<a name=161:6></a> I or Dr.<a name=161:7></a> Newman may grow in the knowledge of Christ.<a name=161:8></a> Faithful zeal may resist and dispel errors which arise, and by which Satan seeks to cloud the truth and overthrow faith; but there cannot be a development of the infinitely perfect and completely revealed Person of the Son of God, in whom dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.<a name=161:9></a> Dr.<a name=161:10></a> Newman may find (in spite of Bishop Bull, and as Pettau has admitted) that: the ante-Nicene fathers were worse than obscure as to the divinity of the blessed Lord; but Paul is not, who declares that the fulness of the Godhead <i>(theotes</i> not <i>theiotes</i>, that is, proper Deity, not divine character simply) dwells in Him bodily; John is not, who declares, He is the true God, was with God, and was God; and the New Testament, so plainly and blessedly making Christ known to us, is not.<a name=161:11></a> There He is Immanuel, Jesus -- Jehovah the Saviour.<a name=161:12></a> He may rejoice that the Nicene Council re-affirmed this truth.<a name=161:13></a> But to say that this was development, and that the church of God <i>for three centuries</i> did not know the true divinity of Christ is high treason against Christ and the truth.<a name=161:14></a> It is the folly of a mind who, to excuse itself and make out a point, gives up all fundamental truth -- does not possess it.<a name=161:15></a> It may lead to Romanism -- I dare say it does; I am sure it does not lead to God.<a name=161:16></a> The apostle tells us, on this very head, "Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard <i>from the beginning</i>.<a name=161:17></a> If that therefore which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father.<a name=161:18></a>" There might be the rejection of heresies, as Arianism, whose source was in Platonism and philosophy, or of other similar evil doctrines; but it was not to develop but to maintain what was from the beginning.<a name=161:19></a> So the apostle Paul, "But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned, .<a name=161:20></a>.<a name=161:21></a>.<a name=161:22></a> knowing of whom thou hast learned them.<a name=161:23></a>" I admit no development: that is popery.<a name=161:24></a>

		I have gone through the proofs that God's truth was not what Dr.<a name=168:1></a> Newman sought, but to settle the question between the principles of catholicity and antiquity, or Romanism and Anglicanism; that men's opinions, not God's word, were what gradually led him on, and that he had no divine foundation for faith at all, but avowedly only probability, which in its nature excludes the idea of the reception of a divine testimony.<a name=168:2></a> I will now inquire a little into his actual progress, in which, it seems to me, astonishing levity of mind is exhibited, a large share of self-confidence, it may be some more direct power of the enemy.<a name=168:3></a> I shall be forgiven (as instructively tracing the elements of a history, given to us by himself, which has taken the course Dr.<a name=168:4></a> Newman's has) in remarking how much he was occupied with himself.<a name=168:5></a> At page 20 or 23 he records the phases of his youthful feeling; he kept even his Latin verses and copy-books made and used when a young boy; small things, but which shew the tone and character of mind which were fully developed in after life, as here depicted.<a name=168:6></a> When he left his tutorship for the continent, he had a vision of some future before him, and on his return felt he had a work to do.<a name=168:7></a> "I was naturally led to think that some inward changes, as well as some larger course of action, was coming upon me" (81).<a name=168:8></a> His imagination was wild and unrestrained too, and somehow or other formed in a popish school.<a name=168:9></a> He headed his first copybook as a child with a crucifix and rosary, and crossed himself before going into the dark, before he was fifteen; longed that the Arabian tales should be true; thought life might be a dream, or himself an angel; the world a deception, and his fellow-angels concealing themselves from him, and deceiving him with the semblance of a material world (53-55).<a name=168:10></a> Nor when a clergyman had this character disappeared.<a name=168:11></a> In 1834 he said of the angels in a sermon, "Every breath of air, and ray of light and heat, every beautiful prospect is as it were the skirts of their garments, the waving of the robes of those whose faces see God.<a name=168:12></a>" "Again I ask, what would be the thoughts of a man who, examining a flower, or a herb, or a pebble, or a ray of light, which he treats as something so beneath him in the scale of existence, suddenly discovered that he was in the presence of some powerful being, who was hidden behind the visible things he was inspecting, who, etc.<a name=168:13></a>, .<a name=168:14></a>.<a name=168:15></a>.<a name=168:16></a> nay, whose robe and ornament these objects were?<a name=168:17></a>" (77).<a name=168:18></a> "Also, besides the hosts of evil spirits, I considered there was a middle race, <i>daimonia</i>, neither in heaven nor in hell, partially fallen, capricious, wayward, noble or crafty, benevolent or malicious, as the case might be.<a name=168:19></a> They gave a sort of inspiration or intelligence to races, nations, and classes of men.<a name=168:20></a> Hence the actions of bodies politic," etc.<a name=168:21></a> (78).<a name=168:22></a> This is connected with his study of Clemens Alexandrinus and Alexandrianism, that is, of the Neoplatonism which corrupted the gospel, and was the true source of Arianism, this Clemens himself being unsound, and Justin Martyr expressly declaring that it was impossible the supreme God could be made flesh.<a name=168:23></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#170:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>I should have doubted what Dr. N. meant by the primeval mystery, but for the words, "to which I had so great a devotion in my youth." This was the Platonic system of ideas and demons, material things being merely a representative to sense of archetypal truth. This, though Neoplatonism properly speaking, was a subsequent system, a last effort of philosophy against Christianity, reigned among the Alexandrian Fathers. Justin Martyr never gave up his philosopher's cloak. Clement had his common teaching, and his esoteric for the initiated.

	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#170:f2"><sup>++</sup></a>That all this doctrine about souls and angels, or demons, is half Platonic, half philosopho-Mosaic, is unquestionable. It had a semi-Jewish, semi-heathen origin, coming, I doubt not (as no one who has examined Manicheism, Gnosticism, and eastern or old Persian views, can, I think, question), from the East. Philo represents the mixture in the Lord and apostles time. He held that all was full of living beings (the sun, moon, and stars being not only animals, but most pure minds); that all the air, the space from the moon, the extreme of heaven proper, to the earth, was filled with souls as numerous as the stars; that the higher ones were very pure, and were demons, called angels by Moses, the lower ones loved getting down into human bodies; the root of all the doctrine being the evil of matter. See Philo *peri Genesis* (1, 263, Mangey) *peri Phut. Noe* (1, 331), *peri tou theop. on*. (1, 641), and elsewhere. This Origen held to be true. He maintains it largely De Prin. lib 1, 7 (1, 72, 73, De la Rue), and that they first had a body, and that then a soul entered into it, which desires to depart and be with Christ. Clement is said to have denied it. I cannot find the passage. In the system referred to above, these demons, or angels, were hell to be intercessors, as the Jews also taught.

		But this by the bye.<a name=173:1></a> That Alexandrian theology was philosophical, and corrupted by philosophy, is certain: Clement, the great Alexandrian teacher, does not conceal it.<a name=173:2></a> He says in his Stromata (ed.<a name=173:3></a> Potter 1, 319, line 35), speaking of the nourishment of souls, the peace in the word, and the life which is of God; he adds, "For souls have their own nourishment, some growing in knowledge and intelligence, some fed according to the Grecian philosophy, of which, as in the case of nuts, all is not edible.<a name=173:4></a>" In lib.<a name=173:5></a> 7, 2 (1831, 2), "the word teaches all, some as friends, some as faithful servants, some as servants; he is the teacher who instructs the man of knowledge (the Gnostic) in mysteries (this is the esoteric teaching for a few), the faithful by good hopes, and the hard-hearted by corrective discipline and sensible (aesthetic) powers.<a name=173:6></a>" And afterwards: "He, the Word, it is who gives philosophy to the Greeks by inferior angels; for the angels, by a divine and ancient ordinance, are distributed by nations, but the doctrine of believers is the Lord's part, insisting on the divine care of all.<a name=173:7></a>" So in book 6, 8 (773), "All things useful to life are given by the Word, but philosophy more especially to the Greeks was given to them as a special covenant, to be as a foundation of philosophy according to Christ.<a name=173:8></a>" And in book 1, 6 (page 337) he makes the sower of the parable to have come thus from above from the foundation of the world.<a name=173:9></a> What this philosophy was he tells us (338): "Philosophy, I say not the Stoic, not the Platonic, nor the Epicurean and Aristotelian, but whatever things are said rightly by each of these sects, teaching righteousness with pious intelligence; this, as a whole, I call eclectic philosophy.<a name=173:10></a>" The law, he says elsewhere, was for the Jews, philosophy for the Greeks, till Christ came (6, 17, page 823), the whole chapter being a long discourse on this subject, each receiving it according to their deserts.<a name=173:11></a>

Such is the fruit of ignorance of redemption. Bishop Butler's words are these: "This way of putting the matter supposes particular affections" (or propensions as he calls them) "to remain in a future state, which it is scarce possible to avoid supposing." And he is speaking of "the danger finite creatures are in from the very nature of propensions or particular affections." (Part 1, chapter 5, on "Moral Discipline.)

		But the sick man, filled with his primeval mystery and inclined towards Rome, having left all the forms of truth that had been the means of his conversion, was looking for a second Reformation, and, through a "vision," a larger course of action for himself.<a name=177:1></a> His journey completes this picture.<a name=177:2></a> He was not much among the Roman Catholics.<a name=177:3></a> His imagination was at work on new scenes naturally enough.<a name=177:4></a> "The sight of so many great places, venerable shrines, and noble churches, much impressed my imagination," he tells us.<a name=177:5></a> He heard singing in a country church at six o'clock, and his heart thus also was touched (100).<a name=177:6></a> Now, a religious congregation singing, when heard from without, has this effect -- touches deeply the religious imagination where it exists.<a name=177:7></a> It could not have been anything really spiritual in his mind; for he did not know what they were singing.<a name=177:8></a> In his weary days at Palermo, "I was not ungrateful for the comfort which I had received in frequenting the churches, nor did I ever forget it.<a name=177:9></a>" Then again, "her zealous maintenance of the doctrine and rule of celibacy, which I recognized as apostolic, and her faithful agreement with antiquity in so many points besides which were clear to me, was an argument, as well as a plea, in favour of the great church of Rome.<a name=177:10></a> Thus I learned to have tender feelings towards her, but still my reason was not affected at all" (page 100).<a name=177:11></a>

What a satire! What are we to believe to be holy? the unholy church. And how is it then a proof? I am to know the true church by its holiness, and when I find an awfully wicked body, believe it is holy because it is the church!

"Ignoscenda tamen puto talia parvis, <br>Gaudia quae ducunt epulis, quia mentibus error <br>Irrepit rudibus, nec tantae conscia culpae, <br>Simplicitas pietate cadit, male credula sanctos <br>Perfusis halante mero gaudere sepulcris." </blockquote>Is this holiness -- is it a system of holiness? Paulinus does not approve of it. But it was common; and the system which gave rise to it was approved by Rome, as a system. In the well-known letter to Mellitus, Gregory I desires Augustine not to pull down the temples, if well built, but to sprinkle them with holy water, put relics of saints in them, and as they were accustomed to slaughter many oxen in the sacrifice of demons, the solemnity was to be changed somewhat. On the festival of the saint whose relics were there, they were to make booths about the cleansed temple, and celebrate the solemnity with religious feasts; that while some external joys were reserved to them, they might be better able to consent to internal ones, as it was not doubtful it was impossible to cut off all at once with hard minds.

		Now I look all this in the face, and take the question up, not on the disputed claims of churches, who mutually disprove their respective claims, but on the question of <i>the</i> church, as man looks at it now, as we see it in every time as the subject of ecclesiastical history; and I say it never was, as a system, the institution of God, or what God established; but at all times, from its first appearance in ecclesiastical history, the departure, as a system, from what God established, and nothing else; primitive church and all; and the more it was formally established, the more it was corrupt.<a name=251:22></a> Saints, beloved of God I do not doubt were and are in it; but it was a corruption offensive to God from the beginning of its history.<a name=251:23></a> Take a history, any history, of the church, it is a history, not of God's institution, but of man's corruption.<a name=251:24></a> History and scripture both testify of this, and no man can speak of the church of ecclesiastical history, if he be an honest man, without admitting that it was man's corruption, not God's institution, or denying history and scripture alike; I say, from its outset as the subject of ecclesiastical records, or scripture statements.<a name=251:25></a>

		That Christ has a church which He loved and gave Himself for, and will present to Himself a glorious church, no true Christian denies; nor that the work which gathered it was to be carried on on earth, nor that, in a scriptural sense, the foundation was laid on earth.<a name=252:1></a> All that is true; but my proposition is simple: the church as the subject of history never was anything but man's corruption; the people who composed it went on, but the moment it was left to man's responsibility it departed from God's principles.<a name=252:2></a>

		Now I shall first present the historical fact before I quote the instructions of scripture on the subject; but scripture must itself tell us both the basis from which men fell away, and some of the facts too.<a name=254:1></a> Now Galatians, without going into the higher doctrines of Ephesians and Colossians, will afford us the great foundational basis, and in a measure what departure from it is.<a name=254:2></a> Two great principles lie at the base of Christianity, God's righteousness, Christ sitting at the right hand of God, and the presence of the Holy Ghost.<a name=254:3></a> Paul tells us (2 Corinthians 3) that Christianity (or the gospel) was the ministration of righteousness and the ministration of the Spirit: these are the two great essential elements.<a name=254:4></a> So again, "But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested"; and again, "to declare, I say, at this time His righteousness"; and "the righteousness of God by faith of Jesus Christ.<a name=254:5></a>" So Philippians 3, "not having mine own righteousness which is by the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith.<a name=254:6></a>" Christ has made peace by the blood of His cross, and left peace to His disciples.<a name=254:7></a> Peace was what was preached, and remission of sins: "being justified by faith," says the apostle, "we have peace with God," Christ having borne our sins in His own body on the tree.<a name=254:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The cross had told what man was.<a name=254:9></a> He had there rejected God's Son, His last messenger to seek fruit from men as such; and God's work of redemption and peace-making was wholly finished here, so that believers are reconciled to God, have no more conscience of sins.<a name=254:10></a> In Him we have redemption through His blood, even the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace; redeemed by the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot.<a name=254:11></a> They that are sanctified are perfected for ever by one offering, and the Holy Ghost is a witness that our sins and iniquities are remembered no more; yea, we have boldness for the day of judgment, because as He (Christ) is, so are we in this world.<a name=254:12></a> It is on the work of grace in Christ that the apostle rests, and assures us of the blessedness of the man to whom the Lord imputes no sin, our being justified by faith; Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness.<a name=254:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in the Galatian assemblies the Judaizing teachers had introduced the doctrine of righteousness by the law; and this the apostle earnestly combats.<a name=254:14></a> In no epistle do we find the anxiety that is in this, not a salutation at the end, not a kind word at the beginning; but, absorbed by the fatal subversion of Christianity that had got in amongst them, he plunges at once into his subject -- "I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel, which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ: but though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.<a name=254:15></a> As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that which ye have received, let him be accursed.<a name=254:16></a>"

		He then goes on laboriously to deny any succession from the apostles; he had received neither the truth nor office from them; he was not of man nor by man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father.<a name=254:17></a> His adversaries insisted on succession in the ministry and ordination, but he indignantly repudiated it; but the main point which he declared to be the subversion of Christianity was the introduction of righteousness by works of law, or law in any shape.<a name=254:18></a> It was frustrating, setting aside, and making void <i>(ouk atheto)</i> the grace of God, for if righteousness came by law, Christ was dead in vain.<a name=254:19></a> And as many as were of the works of the law were under the curse.<a name=254:20></a> This was the great thesis of the apostle: Christ is become of no effect unto you; as many of you as are justified by the law, ye are fallen from grace.<a name=254:21></a> And what he especially appeals to in testimony of this is, that they had received the Holy Ghost as the seal of this doctrine of being justified by faith, and not by works of law; the presence of the Holy Ghost, and the way it came, decided the question.<a name=254:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not question that fruits of a new nature would follow, demonstrating the faith to be real, and that the Christian has to shew his faith by his works, but never by works of law.<a name=254:23></a> The works which God delights in are alone those which are the fruit of faith.<a name=254:24></a> The Christian is bound, and disposed, if he is one, to do good works: you do right to claim them from him, but why?<a name=254:25></a> Because he is a Christian first.<a name=254:26></a> People have forgotten the simple principle that duties flow from the relationships we are already in, and cannot exist for us till we are in those relationships.<a name=254:27></a> I say this much to avoid mistakes, but it is not my subject.<a name=254:28></a> Man had duties as man, but he has failed in them; he is a sinner, and is lost, according to Christianity.<a name=254:29></a> The full exposition given in the Romans on this great point is, that Gentiles were lawless, the Jews law-breakers; that there was none righteous, no not one; that every mouth was stopped, and all the world guilty before God; all had sinned and come short of the glory of God; being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that was in Christ Jesus.<a name=254:30></a> And Christianity teaches us that the blessed Son of God finished the work which His Father gave Him to do; and we read that by Him all that believe are justified from all things, from which they could not be justified by the law of Moses: that, when He had by Himself purged our sins, He sat down at the right hand of God; that, if this whole work of making peace and perfecting the believers for ever were not accomplished by His one offering, He must have suffered often.<a name=254:31></a>

		We have seen that it is by faith that we are justified; redemption is through His blood; and hence the believer's being justified through faith, reconciled to God, having peace with God, is one great pillar of Christianity, Christianity itself as a foundation including the blessed revelation of the Father in the Son: for it is not as slighting His blessed Person that I speak of His work, but when grace has drawn the heart to own His Person, the gospel is the answer to the need the revelation of His Person has created.<a name=256:1></a> So the poor woman in the city that was a sinner, drawn in deep humiliation to His Person, receives the answer, "Thy sins are forgiven thee, thy faith hath saved thee: go in peace.<a name=256:2></a>" The thief who owned Him Lord and the Man who had done nothing amiss, and looked for the kingdom, received the blessed answer, "To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise.<a name=256:3></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The other great truth which constitutes Christianity is the presence of the Holy Ghost; that the believer receives it, so that he is sealed thereby, and that the Spirit dwells in him.<a name=256:4></a> We have a kind of picture of the connection of both in John 20, when the Lord first says to Mary Magdalene to tell His brethren, "I go to my Father and your Father, my God and your God"; and then, when they gather, He is there, and says to them, "Peace be unto you," and "as my Father hath sent me, so send I you.<a name=256:5></a> And when he had said this, he breathed on them and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost.<a name=256:6></a>" I merely take the general thought that we get the disciples, the brethren, put into the same relationship to God and the Father as Christ Himself, peace proclaimed to them, and the Holy Ghost communicated to them.<a name=256:7></a>

		I return to the Galatians, to which I first referred.<a name=257:1></a> We have seen how the apostle makes justification by faith a question of Christianity, or the contrary; and this we have seen confirmed by a crowd of passages, and divine righteousness put as the answer to there being none righteous, no, not one, amongst men, and this by the work of Christ effectual to us by faith, so that we are perfected for ever by one offering, and no sin imputed to us.<a name=257:2></a> The apostle shews how this is no allowance of sin, but the way of power against it, in Romans 6; only here I confine myself to the point in hand.<a name=257:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now let us see what is said as to the Holy Spirit.<a name=257:4></a> This is directly everywhere connected with the exaltation of Christ as man to the right hand of God; that when man in the Person of the Lord Jesus was exalted to the right hand of God, in virtue of His perfectly glorifying God on the cross, the Holy Ghost was sent down here to dwell in them that believe; and that this made the distinctive difference of Christians and Christianity, divine righteousness having placed man on high; as the result of a work done for man's salvation and blessing, the Holy Ghost was given to those that believed.<a name=257:5></a> Let us proceed to cite the proofs; they may be multiplied, but the principal ones are so clear and definite that I need not go through them, though the distinctive character of the presence of the Holy Ghost marking out the essential difference of Christianity will be clearer the more we are acquainted with the Old and New Testaments.<a name=257:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The promise of the Holy Ghost in the Old Testament, as characterizing Christianity, is sufficiently demonstrated by Peter's quotation of Joel: "It shall come to pass in the last days I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams, and on my servants and on my handmaids will I pour out in those days of my Spirit.<a name=257:7></a>" It is only needful to remark that it was upon <i>all</i>, young and old, servants and handmaids, no trace of a clergy or body to whom it was limited, but formally the contrary: nor was it then only the apostles, there were a hundred and twenty there, and women among them.<a name=257:8></a> The Lord Himself had promised it: "If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink, and, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water; this spake he of the Spirit which they that believe on him should receive, for the Holy Ghost was not yet [given, <i>oupo en]</i>, because Jesus was not yet glorified"; what was known as the Holy Ghost thus present among them was not yet.<a name=257:9></a>

		And this is what the twelve disciples at Ephesus say; we have not so much as heard, not whether there be any Holy Ghost, but whether the Holy Ghost is (come).<a name=258:1></a> They were John's disciples, and he had spoken of baptizing with the Holy Ghost as one of the things which Jesus would do, presenting the work of Jesus as comprehended in the two things I have spoken of -- the Lamb of God that takes away sin, and He that baptizes with the Holy Ghost.<a name=258:2></a> So the Lord Himself, "If I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you, but if I go away, I will send him unto you.<a name=258:3></a>" So again, "whom the Father will send in my name.<a name=258:4></a>" When He is come, He will reprove (convict) the world of sin and righteousness and judgment, guide the disciples into all truth, and shew them things to come.<a name=258:5></a> So Peter (when He was come according to promise), "being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost [note this reception of it for others on His exaltation], he hath shed forth this which ye now see and hear": and when pricked in their hearts, they asked, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?<a name=258:6></a>" he replies, "Repent, and be baptized, every one of you, for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.<a name=258:7></a> For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.<a name=258:8></a>" So, before the priests, "We are witnesses of these things, and so also is the Holy Ghost which is given to them that obey him.<a name=258:9></a>" So to Cornelius God gives the proof that He will have the Gentiles by giving him the Holy Ghost, so that Peter could not forbid water.<a name=258:10></a> So at Samaria, they all receive the Holy Ghost by means of Peter and John, having been baptized by Philip.<a name=258:11></a> In the case referred to in Acts 19 Paul says, "Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed?<a name=258:12></a>"

		These are ample to shew that the presence of the Holy Ghost, founded on the work of Christ and His exaltation, was the distinctive character of Christianity; the blessings connected with it run through the New Testament; the love of God shed abroad in our hearts, the knowledge that we are in Christ and Christ in us, the knowing that we are sons, so that we cry, Abba, Father -- nay, dwelling in God, and God in us.<a name=259:1></a> True holy liberty, true divine knowledge, all and every enjoyment of blessings, and abounding in hope, and help in our infirmities, are attributed to the Holy Ghost; our good fruits are the fruits of the Spirit; our joy is joy in the Holy Ghost; our love, love in the Spirit; it is by one Spirit through Christ we have access to the Father: "If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his"; and this is Christ being in us.<a name=259:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		All this shews to an attentive mind that it is distinctive of the Christian, but though it be the bright and blessed side, I must not dwell on this further, but cite what FORMALLY shews it to be distinctive of the Christian; it is, "If we are led of the Spirit, we are not under law": our bodies are the temple of the Holy Ghost which we have of God: we are not to grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by which we are sealed for the day of redemption.<a name=259:3></a> What is the appeal of the apostle to the Galatians connected with justification by faith?<a name=259:4></a> "This only would I learn of you, received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?<a name=259:5></a> Are ye so foolish, having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect in the flesh?<a name=259:6></a>" They were slipping away through Judaizing teachers, teachers of the law, who were subverting (we read) whole houses from justification by faith; and his appeal, as that which they all knew, is to their having received the Holy Ghost -- not that they all walked well, but that the Holy Ghost was come, and that they had received it.<a name=259:7></a>

		But it is not my object to draw all the consequences of the presence of the Holy Ghost, but merely to shew that Christianity was characterized by it: even if they walked badly, they grieved the Holy Spirit of Gad by which they were sealed unto the day of redemption.<a name=260:1></a> It is not surprising.<a name=260:2></a> The Father sending the Son was the grand and mighty basis of Christianity, and the sending of the Spirit by both the Father and a glorified Christ was a witness of His Lordship and exaltation, and the great testimony in the world, and that by which we know the value of the work and exaltation of One, and our relationship with the other, as sons by grace with Him -- that by which all was received here.<a name=260:3></a> Such was Christianity essentially in its basis.<a name=260:4></a> There were other collateral truths of course, and important ones too, but these formed its base, not only for our blessing, but for the full revelation of God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.<a name=260:5></a>

		As a rule, elders and deacons were appointed in the various assemblies; ministry consisted in the exercise of gift (the gifts of the Spirit, who distributed to every man severally as He would), and each gifted person was a member of Christ's body, and exercised it according to scriptural order under the authority of Christ.<a name=260:8></a> The directions are found in 1 Corinthians, where there is no appearance of the existence of any elders at all.<a name=260:9></a> But such was Christianity as presented to us in scripture in its essential features.<a name=260:10></a> Has it preserved them?<a name=260:11></a> Is what is now called the church that Christianity, the system I find there?<a name=260:12></a>

The question arose, and was regularly debated, if sins could be forgiven afterwards; and already in Hermas, remission, and repentance afterwards, are distinguished; and in Tertullian, when Montanists contended against forgiving an adulterer, forgiveness by baptism was administrative and for the past. The acceptance of the person is wholly a different thing, and never thought of.

		I may sum up the system in the words of a writer long subsequent, as briefly stating the system, using another's translation: "Whereas the human race, by the demerit derived to it from the fault of the first sinner, had become pierced with the darts of eternal punishment .<a name=271:4></a>.<a name=271:5></a>.<a name=271:6></a> .<a name=271:7></a> Christ granted to it certain remedial sacraments, to the end that it might acknowledge the difference between what is merited by nature and what it received by grace; and that, as nature could bring punishment only, grace, not called grace if granted to merit, might furnish whatever appertains to salvation.<a name=271:8></a>" This is its ripe formulary.<a name=271:9></a> The system began as soon as the apostles were gone.<a name=271:10></a>

		There were two departures from truth: heresy, particularly at first Gnosticism -- this ends in Antichrist; and a human view of the church, with the practical denial of the Christian's place by the Spirit; the last ends in Babylon.<a name=271:11></a> This takes essentially the character of the clergy, and the Spirit being with them; and so of the sacramental system as the channels of special grace.<a name=271:12></a> We may now see what light the New Testament throws on the subject; but history and the writings of the apostolic fathers, so called, from Clement to Hermas, shew us plainly that the doctrine of the Christian's place in Christ, and of the Holy Ghost present and active in all saints, as also freely distributing His gifts as He will, was totally lost at once by Christians after the apostles were gone.<a name=271:13></a> I am not denying that there was a set of people gathered, which gathering, in fact, continued, and was corrupted gradually (this is clear), but that from the outset this gathered body of men lost the place, position, and power of that in which they had been established, and that the principles on which the gathering stood and was held to exist were, as soon as placed on their own responsibility, the contrary of what God had set them on.<a name=271:14></a> That it was not a body of persons knowing themselves to be in Christ, exalted as man at the right hand of God, consequent upon His having redeemed them, and perfected them for ever, for whom there was no condemnation, every one of whom was anointed and sealed by the Holy Ghost come down from heaven, the earnest of the inheritance which they had not yet, which Holy Ghost, uniting them into one body, and distributing to every man severally as He would, made each a servant of Christ in his place and gift, and responsible to trade with the talent confided to him; and, as every man had received the gift, so to minister the same; but a body of persons who were viewed as connected with a clergy, who might or might not be gifted, but their connection with whom formed them into one corporation, of which the administration of the sacraments formed the bond and link, and who by their works were to obtain salvation at the end.<a name=271:15></a>

		Now this was really the Judaism against which the apostle so earnestly contended, and which met and harassed him in his service in every place, which would have a derived ordained ministry, disowning the power and title of the Spirit, and the true Lordship of Christ, and teaching justification by works, apostolic succession, and the observing of days and months and years.<a name=272:1></a>

		The tares which the devil sowed in the field were to remain till harvest; the mystery of iniquity already working in the apostles' days would go on and ripen into the man of sin, and end in judgment.<a name=273:10></a> When the message comes from Christ through John to the churches, they have no authority but are judged, and the Christian is called upon to hear what the Spirit says to them; they were not competent to speak or guide, but he that had ears to hear was to listen to the judgment pronounced on them, to what was said.<a name=273:11></a> No voice of any universal church was to guide, but the individual to listen to the voice of testimony as to what was found in the church.<a name=273:12></a> The church did not judge or guide or teach, but the word revealed Christ's judgment of this church, and to that he who had ears was to listen.<a name=273:13></a>

		I will not dwell on this, but what a pretension this is, that the priest, on pronouncing the formula -- "This is my body," turns the bit of paste into God, or (as it is constantly expressed by themselves) the priest makes God; for this is the expression familiarly used among them when they have the courage to speak freely.<a name=283:1></a> Now I knew a very poor man in Ireland tell his neighbour, a staunch champion for his church, when he was arguing for this doctrine, that he was contending for what he did not believe; for if that was true, the priest could do what God could not do, for God could not make God.<a name=283:2></a> And this is true enough.<a name=283:3></a> A poor man, James, if taught of God, often hits right and wrong -- truth and error -- right on the head better than your learned men that make all kinds of fine distinctions.<a name=283:4></a> Nor would their distinctions serve here.<a name=283:5></a> They cannot say Christ comes into the bread as God was incarnate, because there the manhood was, and remained manhood; but, according to their doctrine, the bread does not remain at all.<a name=283:6></a> And therefore it is called transubstantiation; that is, the substance of the bread is changed into the substance of Christ, and the body, blood, soul, and divinity of Christ are all there.<a name=283:7></a> They make a Christ out of the bread -- a whole Christ, divinity and all.<a name=283:8></a> It must indeed be a new Christ.<a name=283:9></a> You cannot change it into the Christ that is already.<a name=283:10></a>

		<i>N</i>.<a name=285:17></a> A word about this rest, James.<a name=285:18></a> I do not deny that the Roman Catholic system gives rest to some persons.<a name=285:19></a> Suppose a child had been at mischief, and was uneasy, and some one was to appease its parent, or its master, and it was let off, or its schoolmaster was to pardon repeated faults which shewed a bad disposition, and not tell the parent: the child would be at ease, and have its conscience quiet, and think no more about it; but it would not have a <i>purified</i> conscience.<a name=285:20></a> A little penitence might be added to keep up appearances, but the evil would be unhealed.<a name=285:21></a> That is the church's absolution as contrasted with God's pardon.<a name=285:22></a> It quiets the conscience, but it does not purge it.<a name=285:23></a> This will not do for God, nor for a soul in which true desires after Himself are awakened.<a name=285:24></a> The doctrine of absolution and the sacrament of penance is an unholy doctrine.<a name=285:25></a> It is professedly a means of having forgiveness where the heart has not attained to true contrition.<a name=285:26></a> This is the express doctrine of the Catechism of the Council of Trent, a work of absolute authority for all Roman Catholics.<a name=285:27></a> According to that the sacrament of penance is a less precarious and less difficult means of reconciliation and salvation than contrition, afforded by the Almighty by giving to the church the keys of the kingdom of heaven.<a name=285:28></a><a href="#285:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> Thus the conscience gets tranquillity without that true contrition which alone restores the soul to true communion with God.<a name=285:29></a> It is, in my judgment, a horribly wicked doctrine, to say nothing of its accompaniments connected with confession.<a name=285:30></a> The practical result is that thousands and thousands sin all the year, get cleared off by absolution for communion at Easter, and begin to sin again as soon as Easter is over.<a name=285:31></a>

It is thus translated in his edition published at Rome, and printed, Latin and English, at the Propaganda Press: "But as this is a degree of contrition which very few could reach, the consequence, also, was, that very few could have hoped to obtain through perfect contrition the pardon of their sins. It therefore became necessary that the Almighty, in His infinite mercy, should provide by some easier means for the common salvation of men: this He did, in His admirable wisdom, when He gave to His church the keys of the kingdom of heaven," etc. -- Volume 1, page 535, "Confession; its Importance." -- *Cath.

		A remarkable image of these truths is found in the history of the children of Israel, which may help you to understand what this deliverance is which I speak of.<a name=291:1></a> When God passed through Egypt in judgment, the blood on the doorposts protected them against that judgment, and most blessed it was; but Israel was still in Egypt.<a name=291:2></a> But when they arrived at the Red Sea, God said by Moses: "Stand still and see the salvation of Jehovah.<a name=291:3></a>" Then Israel, as you remember, passed through the Red Sea dry-shod, and got out of Egypt, and into an entirely new position: as a people accepted of God, having a great deal to learn, but with God, and all their former state behind them.<a name=291:4></a> So it is not all, that the precious blood of Christ protects us, as the Lamb slain for us, from the righteous judgment of God; but His death and resurrection bring us into a new place, accepted before God in Him, who is risen up from among the dead after having paid the wages of sin for us.<a name=291:5></a> But I must leave you, James, thankful that you see that Christ has made peace by the blood of His cross.<a name=291:6></a> You can rejoice with your dear wife: it will be a cheer to her, and lead your children on.<a name=291:7></a> A poor man is the happiest being on the earth when he has the Lord with him in his peaceful, if humble, home.<a name=291:8></a> It is not that you will not find questions and difficulties arise in your mind, and temptations to overcome, and sin to resist; the Lord has warned us it will be so -- but we have One to go to, whom you, as I trust, now know for yourself, James.<a name=291:9></a>

		<i>N</i>.<a name=294:3></a> They are very shy indeed of saying what it is.<a name=294:4></a> Our friend, Dr.<a name=294:5></a> Milner, says, "All which is necessary to be believed on that subject is, there is a purgatory, and the souls detained there are helped by the prayers of the faithful, and particularly by the acceptable sacrifice of the altar.<a name=294:6></a>" This is the same as the Council of Trent.<a name=294:7></a> Only they anathematize any one who denies that, after men are freed from the eternal penalty of their sins, they have to satisfy in this world or in purgatory the temporal penalty to which they are liable for them.<a name=294:8></a> They do not tell us what it is, and forbid curious questions; only there is, they say, a place of temporary punishment.<a name=294:9></a> In the Catechism of the Council of Trent, however, it is called <i>the fire of purgatory</i>, in which the souls of the just are cleansed by a temporary punishment.<a name=294:10></a><a href="#294:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> Those who get in must stay there till they have paid the very last farthing, for so they apply that text; yet their friends can help them to get out by prayers, alms, and particularly by the so-called sacrifice of the Mass.<a name=294:11></a> Now all this you can easily see (however little clear it may be) goes clean against the whole testimony of God as to the forgiveness of sins.<a name=294:12></a> They ground it in their reasonings on the impossibility of a soul suffering for a small sin as it would for murder.<a name=294:13></a> They put a person under vindictive temporal punishment, which does not purify, but satisfies God.<a name=294:14></a> They are always labouring to get people out; indulgences are used to spare people part of this temporal punishment due to sin, as they say, but "no one can ever be sure that he has gained the entire benefit of an indulgence, though he has performed all the conditions appointed for this end.<a name=294:15></a>"<a href="#294:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a> How different is scripture.<a name=294:16></a> God does chasten for sin with a view to our holiness, even when we are perfectly forgiven -- He, for our profit (it is said), that we may be partakers of His holiness.<a name=294:17></a> That, the heart assured of His goodness can easily believe, and bless Him for it.<a name=294:18></a> He speaks to us (as it is beautifully said) as unto children: "My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him.<a name=294:19></a>" It is also true that God governs, and shews sometimes His displeasure against sin in this world.<a name=294:20></a> And He has so ordered the world that he that sows to the flesh, of the flesh reaps corruption; but a vindictive penalty -- when a man is not in the flesh at all, as to which God can be satisfied by the man's sufferings in this or another world, or by his friends' offerings, with which no purifying is connected, but which serve merely to buy him off from God's hand, who will not let him go till the last farthing is paid -- is a horrible blasphemy against the truth and grace of God.<a name=294:21></a> The scriptures do not teach us thus.<a name=294:22></a> What should you say, James, to the thought that, after God had forgiven you, and declared that He would remember your sins and iniquities no more, God was going to put you into the fire or some other horrible pain, till you paid Him the last farthing of these temporal penalties?<a name=294:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#294:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>It is singular enough the obscurity and inconsistency of the Catechism of the Council of Trent on this subject. In the article on the descent into hell, besides what I have just quoted, after speaking of purgatory, it is said, "The third kind of abode is that in which were received the souls of the just who died before Christ, and where, without experiencing any kind of pain, supported by the. blessed hope of redemption, they enjoyed peaceful repose. These pious souls, then, who in the bosom of Abraham were expecting the Saviour, Christ the Lord liberated, descending into hell." (Volume 1, page 123, 3.) Shortly after, in the same article, it is said, speaking of the descent of the *just:* "They all descended, some to endure the most acute torments; others, though exempt from actual pain, yet deprived of the vision of God, and of the glory for which they sighed, and consigned to the torture of suspense in painful captivity." Is being consigned to the torture of suspense in painful captivity *peaceful repose* in the bosom of Abraham? Were the holy and the just held in painful captivity in the bosom of Abraham? Is that the picture which scripture gives of it? The fire of purgatory is the *second* thing. 'Limbus patrum' is the *third* kind of abode, where there was no pain, but peaceful repose. Yet some were there to endure the most acute torments. In a further passage it is said, "And the souls of the just, on their departure from this life, were borne to the bosom of Abraham; or, as is still the case with those who require to be freed from the stains of sin or die indebted to the divine justice, were purified in the fire of purgatory" (page 127, 2.) Hence the souls of the just who were enjoying peaceful repose in the torture of suspense must have been perfect souls. The others were in the fire of purgatory as people are now. The Jews belief is that Abraham descended from time to time to deliver souls. Bellarmine insists that it is a material fire -- a strange thing for souls to suffer from. But what is more important, he declares that the element of sin (the *fomes peccati)* is gone by death, because sensuality is extinguished -- habits not. But they must soon be gone too, nay, at once, though that is not the case in this life, because there will *there* be no contrary and resisting element as there is here -- nor is purgatory for these habits, as adults who die directly after baptism, and martyrs do not go there. Yet neither baptism nor martyrdom destroys them. After reasoning thus, and saying purgatory was for none of these, he adds, "There remain, therefore, the penalties of guilt and venial sins, which may properly be called the remains of sins, on account of which purgatory is. But these remains, it is sometimes certain, are purged in death: sometimes it is certain they are not purged, sometimes it is doubtful which happens, and it is most probable they are partly purged and partly not purged." (Volume 2, Bellarm. De Purg. lib. 2, cap. 9, 7 (page 370): "Restat ergo reatus poenae, et peccata venialia, quae proprie dici possunt reliquiae peccatorum, ob quas est purgatorium. Has autem reliquias aliquando certum est in morte purgari; aliquando certum est non purgari: aliquando dubium est, quid fiat, et probabilissimum est, partim purgari, partim non purgari": and preceding and following sections. I cite this because it is thus clear from the highest authority of the Roman Catholic church that it is not inward spiritual purifying, for sensuality is extinguished by death -- not even habits, but the penalty of guilt and venial sin. It is strictly penal and satisfactory; and, secondly, it is exactly for that ("the remains of sin," which extreme unction takes away) that men go into purgatory; which is noticed farther on. The pains of purgatory, says Bellarmine, are most horrible (atrocissimas). It cannot be said how long they last -- they may diminish gradually. This he proves by visions. He enlarges upon the proofs of the horrible pains compared with anything here. In result, for the slightest faults (if Pope Gregory the Great is to be believed), and with no view to purify from lust or sensuality (for that is extinguished), justified holy souls in a state of grace are kept in torment as a mere penal satisfaction. <p>One catechism defines it "a place of punishment where souls suffer for a time, before they go to heaven"; but the Council of Trent and the creed of Pope Pius give us no help here.

		<a class="footnote" name="#300:f2"><sup>++</sup></a>See Dr. Pusey's "Eirenicon," vol. 1, page 122, for the Encyclical. <p>The present pope, in his encyclical letter of 1849, says that the Virgin, "by the foot of Virtue, 'bruised the serpent's head,' and who, being constituted *between Christ and His church*, and, being wholly sweet and full of graces, hath ever delivered the Christian people from calamities of all sorts." ... "For *ye know very well*, ven. brethren, *that the whole of our confidence is placed in the most holy Virgin*, since God has placed in Mary the fulness of all good, that accordingly we may know that, *if there is any hope in us, if any grace, if any salvation, it redounds to us from her*, because such is His will who hath willed that we should have everything through Mary." <p>M. Olier, the founder of the Seminary of S. Sulpice (quoted by Dr. Pusey *in* his "Eirenicon," vol 1, page 104), said, "We are very unworthy to draw near unto Jesus; and He has a right to repulse *[rebuter] us*, because of His justice, since, *having entered into all the feelings of His Father from the time of His blessed resurrection, He finds Himself in the same disposition with the Father towards sinners*, that is, to *reject them; so that the difficulty is to induce Him* to exchange the office of judge for that of advocate; and of a judge to make Him a suppliant. Now this is what the saints effect, and especially the most blessed Virgin!" <p>I will add here, from a prayer-book, "St. John's Manual," recommended (1856) by John, Archbishop of New York, some of the devotions to the Virgin. "I worship thee, O great Queen, and I thank thee for all the graces which thou hast hitherto granted me; and especially I thank thee for having delivered me from hell, which I have so often deserved ... . I place all my hopes in thee, and confide my salvation to thy care." -- *Saint John's Manual*, page 886; and in page 887, "By thee we have been reconciled to our God; Thou art the *only* advocate of sinners ... . We have no hope but in thee, O most pure Virgin."

	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#300:f3"><sup>+++</sup></a>It is the common doctrine that the Virgin has more power in heaven than God, that the mother can command her Son. I have had it stated to myself by poor Roman Catholics. Nor is this the ignorance of the poor: Bernardine Senensis teaches, Serm. 61, Artic. 1, cap. 6: "All things are subject to the command of the Virgin, even God himself." (Quoted by Ussher, "Answer to a Jesuit's Challenge," page 417, where there is a great deal more to the same purpose.) It is expressly founded on a mother's having pre-eminence, and being superior to a son. The words in Latin are, "sequitur quod ips abenedicta Virgo sit superior Deo." It follows that the blessed Virgin herself is superior to God. -- De Bust. Marial. Part 9, Serm. 2. And so it is said that God has reserved the supremacy of justice, but given up to the Virgin the supremacy of grace. And such is the tenor of their practical teaching. Thus, in "The Glories of Mary," by Liguori (vol 1, chapter 3, sec. 2), a sinner, after saying the "Hail Mary" to an image of the Virgin, "saw an infant covered with wounds streaming blood ... he began to weep; but he saw the infant turning away from him ... . He had recourse to the most holy Virgin, saying, Mother of mercy, thy Son rejects me." The Virgin reproached him with renewing the passion of Jesus. "But because Mary knows not how to send away disconsolate a soul that has recourse to her, she turned to her Son to ask pardon for that miserable sinner. Jesus still appeared unwilling to forgive him; but the holy Virgin, placing the infant in the niche, prostrated herself before him, saying, 'Son, I will not depart from thy feet till thou dost pardon this sinner.' Jesus then said, 'Mother, I can refuse thee nothing; thou dost wish me to pardon him, for thy sake I pardon him; make him come and kiss my wounds.' The sinner came weeping bitterly, and as he kissed the wounds of the infant they were healed. In the end Jesus embraced him in token of his pardon; the sinner changed his conduct, and afterwards led a holy life, enamoured of the most holy Virgin"! <p>What shall we say to such statements? The images, in the first place, are the living persons; they do not, as falsely alleged, merely recall these. Real idols! Mercy is in Mary, not in Jesus. It is a denial of His own words: "Him that cometh unto me, I will in no wise cast out." It is for Mary's *sake* that Christ pardons the sinner. And what place has His blood-shedding, which is stopped (!) by the sinner's repentance through Mary's grace? Is it possible to have a more complete subversion of all truth? Upon its folly I offer no comment. Their excuse is that "Jesus is the only mediator of justice between men and God, ... but because men recognize and fear in Jesus Christ the divine majesty which resides in Him as God, the Lord wished to appoint another advocate, to whom we could have recourse with less fear and with more confidence. This advocate is Mary ... ." There is need then of a medium with the mediator Himself. -- S. Bernard, Serm. in Sign. Magnn., quoted in Liguori, vol., 1, chapter 6. sec. 2. Again she is compared to Abigail with David: "She knows so well how to appease the divine justice by her tender and wise prayers, that God Himself blesses her for it, and, as it were, thanks her for thus keeping Him from abandoning them to the chastisements which they deserve." Note that she is a mediatrix of justice *really* in these stupid blasphemies; or what does appeasing the divine justice mean?

		<a class="footnote" name="#307:f2"><sup>++</sup></a>The sixth question on this subject in the Roman Catholic Catechism would lead us to conclude that as there were these pious people in purgatory, as well as saints in Abraham's bosom, before Christ descended, the one -- though in repose -- tortured by suspense, though sustained by hope (a strange kind of repose), the other pious souls not completely saints, tortured horribly in the fire -- so when He descended these last got off to heaven as well as the saints, properly speaking. Who finished their satisfaction for them, without which they could not be clean, we are not told. They were better off than those now in purgatory, any way. These, we are told, must pay the last farthing, or they cannot come out thence. Better to have been a Jew, any way, than a Christian. However that may be, it is to be taught that Christ the Lord went down to hell to liberate from prison those holy fathers and the other pious persons, and brought them to heaven. Yet those in purgatory now enjoy the effects of Christ's expiation, are in a state of grace, sure, Bellarmine tells us, of their salvation, no principle of sin (Fomes peccati) in them; but there they must stay till they have made satisfaction for their faults. The happier Jews and Old Testament saints got clear without doing so,though what Christ did was to impart the benefit of His passion to them, of which the Christians who have to stay enjoy the benefit, but only to bring them into purgatory; for otherwise they would have gone into hell. They are strange inventions all, and hence confusion. It must be so when it is denied that the blood of Jesus Christ *cleanses from all sin*, and that by one offering He has perfected for ever them that are sanctified. But let us remember that the doctrine of purgatory is that, when the guilt of sin is wholly removed, and the principle of sin (Fomes peccati) totally gone, men are to be tortured for a definite time in hell-fire to satisfy God; nor did Christ loose the pains of hell for the saints!

		<a class="footnote" name="#311:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>Alphons. de Castro and the Roman Catholic bishop of Rochester admit that there was nothing about purgatory in the early, especially the Greek, Fathers, and the Greek church denies the doctrine, and passages from Tertullian, Cyprian, Gregory Neocaes., Basil, Dionysius, Quaes. et Resp. ad Orth (ascribed to Justin Martyr), Athanasius (if De Virginitate be his), Hilary, and Ambrose may be quoted, which plainly set aside purgatory, declaring that the righteous go to an eternal home. In the works of Greg. Neocaes. (Hom. 22) Macarius puts the three states: guilty, the devil takes it off; the holy servants of God, angels bring them to the Lord; if between the two, and where a man fights against the evil and loves the Lord with all his soul, He cleanses him in one hour, and takes him unto His bosom and to see light. Thus Athanasius says the just pass out of this world into everlasting rest. Ambrose says wise men desire death as a rest from their labours and an end of their evils; so in other passages. So Macarius; and Gregory Nazianzen (Orat. 32 in Pasch.) says, "nor beyond this night [of this life] is there any purifying." So the famous Cyril of Alexandria on Joan., lib. 12, c. 36. "For he delivered his own soul into the hands of his own Father, that we taking our point of departure in it, and on account of it, may have splendid hopes, firmly feeling and believing that we, having undergone the death of the flesh, shall be in the hands of God, and shall be in a far better state than we were with flesh: wherefore, also, the wise Paul writes to us that it is better to depart and to be with Christ." So the Q. et Respon. ad Orth., in Justin (2, 60). The narration of the rich man and Lazarus is a form of word having this doctrine, that, after the departure of the soul out of the body, it is not possible that by any care or diligence men can get any profit. "There is no death (says Athanasius, De Virg.) for the just, but a change, for he is changed out of this world into the everlasting rest. And as if any one might come out of prison, so the saints go out of this toilsome life into the good things prepared for them." And Ambrose, De bono mortis (4), "It is a certain haven for those who, cast about on the great sea of this life, seek a roadstead of sure quiet, and it does not make their state worse, but such as it has found it in each, such it reserves it for future judgment, and cherishes by the quiet itself." So again (12), "trusting therefore to these, let us go with full courage to our Redeemer Jesus, with full courage to the council of patriarchs, with full courage to our father Abraham, let us go boldly to the assembly of the saints and gathering of the just." It is plain that he had no idea of going to purgatory here, for those named are not there; he names going to Jesus Himself, and that with entire courage, on our death. <p>We might quote Jerome too, but of him I will speak, and Augustine, we have seen, had no settled thoughts. He supposed indeed that the day of judgment itself was a kind of purgatory, Enchiridion, 67, De Civ. Dei, 16, 24, Psalm 103: 5; Psalm 6. As to Cypr. De Mortalitate -- one would have to quote the whole tract. Nothing can be clearer as to the immediate blessedness of all the righteous. The righteous are called to refreshing, the unjust to punishment; it is his part to fear death who is unwilling to go to Christ -- proving and insisting that thus there is for the servants of God peace, their free, their tranquil quiet. It is not going out but going elsewhere, and, time's journey finished, you pass to what is eternal. Who does not haste to better things? <p>"We injure Christ," says Tertullian, "when we do not with undisturbed mind accept others being called away; as if they were to be pitied. They have obtained their desire." (Tert. de Pat. 9, Quaest. et Resp. ad Orth., 75.) The souls of the just go into paradise to meet and see angels and archangels, according to the vision also of the Saviour Christ Himself, and according to what is written, "absent from the body and present with the Lord"; but the souls of the unjust go into the regions of hell (hades), as Nebuchadnezzar. Greg. Thaum. says, the good man will go rejoicing into his own eternal house; but the wicked will fill all things with their complaints. <p>If De Virginitate be not of Athanasius, as the style and some doxologies would shew, it is later. The writer says, "There is no death for the righteous, but translation, for he is translated out of this world into everlasting rest." There is the same truth in Macar. Hom. 22, but it may be alleged to concern the saints -- the holy servants of God. The devils receive the wicked, he says, and drag them to their own place; choirs of angels the holy servants of God. Of any other place he does not speak. But in Hom. 26 he puts the case of conflict, two persons in the soul, as he says, and where is the soul to go, thus drawn two ways? He replies that the Lord, seeing you strive, and sometimes with all your heart, will separate you from death at once, and receive you into His bosom and light. <p>Hilary insists. on all being settled at death, referring to the rich man and Lazarus, and Abraham's bosom as eternal bliss; but though judgment is to come, still the case is settled in death. There is no putting off or delay, for the day of judgment is the eternal retribution of blessedness or punishment; but the time of death holds each one meanwhile by its own laws, either Abraham or punishment keeps each one for judgment. He then insists on confidence, which is more than hope, and refers to John 5; he that believeth on Me shall not be judged. (End of Tract on Psalm 2.) I do not quote more passages at length. <p>Basil and Gregory Naz. teach in general the same truths: the orthodoxy of the last may be questioned. We see from these the general faith of the church. The Hypognosticon once attributed to Augustine is equally clear. "As for any third place we utterly know none, neither shall we find in the holy scriptures that there is any such," Lib. 5. <p>Nor do the Roman Catholics deny that those who go to purgatory are forgiven and justified, and *the principle of sin (peccati fones) is* gone. It is penal suffering from God after guilt and sin are wholly gone. I do not give the Fathers as any *authority*, but as shewing the common current belief. Alphons. de Castro and John of Rochester I give from Ussher, the rest from the original authors. I will speak farther on of the real origin and history of purgatory, and of Jerome and Augustine more particularly. Bellarmine is not quite honest on the point, as he quotes the use of passages such as 1 Corinthians 3, by old writers, which he himself declares cannot be applied to purgatory, because it embraces all, and others as to praying for saints, which proves nothing, because, whatsoever the ground, for they find it hard to say, they prayed for all saints (even the Virgin Mary), that is, for those whom they held to be in heaven already. It may be for glory (Bell. de Purg., lib. 17), and this some said, "for glory given to them among men," for all is darkness and confusion. Indeed Bellarmine's quotations are not to be trusted. He quotes Hilary on Psalm 118 in proof of purgatory (De Purg., lib. 1, 10, sec. 38), leaving out the words which precede his quotation, and which wholly set aside the idea of purgatory. He says we have to undergo that unwearied fire; but Hilary says, "the day of judgment in which we are to undergo," etc., and goes on to say that thus the sword is to pierce the blessed Virgin Mary's heart too -- and how could we desire it then? Either he borrowed his quotation, or he is wilfully dishonest.

These pious souls Christ liberated, for after all they were kept in painful suspense (suspensi torquebantur), and miserable wearisomeness (misera molestia) -- a singular kind of Abraham's bosom. But here purgatory is a distinct thing. We have already seen that Christ brought to heaven, according to the Roman Catholic doctrine, the holy fathers, and the other pious souls freed from prison.

		Hence his notion, whatever it is worth (and it is really worth nothing at all -- it is a mere notion, and I will produce an opposite one from himself in a moment, but, such as it is, it is here), would prove that Abraham was clean out of hades now, and whatever middle place he is in is not purgatory, nor ever was; and moreover that since the death of Christ the faithful redeemed have nothing to do with hades.<a name=327:10></a>

In the tract, De praesentia Dei, or Epistle 187, he says, that whether the bosom of Abraham be paradise or infernal places *(inferos)* he cannot say.

		<a class="footnote" name="#335:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>It is a curious fact, too, that these very prayers *for* the saints were turned into prayers to the saints. These prayers are found in all the ancient liturgies. Thus, in that ascribed to St. James: "Remember, Lord, the God of the spirits of all flesh, the orthodox whom we have commemorated, and whom we have not commemorated, from righteous Abel unto this day. Give them rest there, in the land of the living in thy kingdom, in the delight of paradise, in the bosom of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, our holy fathers, whence pain, sorrow, and groaning are exiled, where the light of thy countenance looks down," etc. And St. Chrysostom, "And further, we offer to thee this reasonable service in behalf of those who have departed in the faith, our ancestors, fathers, patriarchs, apostles, preachers, evangelists, martyrs, confessors, virgins, and every just spirit made perfect in the faith ... especially the most holy, undefiled, excellently-laudable, glorious lady, the mother of God and ever Virgin Mary." I recall here what I have noticed elsewhere, that Epiphanius specially remarks, that Christ alone, as testifying to the glory of His Person, was not prayed for, (Bellarmine attempts to say it was only commemoration at the Mass; but that is false. Epiphanius speaks distinctly of prayers *for* them.) It would only be repeating the same words nearly, to quote all the different liturgies. St. Gregory's, who formed the Roman one, may suffice: "Remember, O Lord, thy servants (male and female) who have preceded us with the sign of faith, and sleep in the sleep of peace. To them, and to all who are at rest (quiescentibus) in Christ, we entreat thou shouldest grant a place of refreshment and light and peace." Nor is this all. In the Decret. Greg. lib. 3, tit. 41, C. 6, Cum Marthae 5 *et infra*, after a long discussion whether the water as well as the wine in the Mass is changed into blood, Innocent III replies to another question of the Archbishop of Lyons, why, when in the ancient liturgies, in a part of the service called the Secreta (where the name of the person in whose honour the Mass was said was mentioned), it ran thus: "Grant, Lord, that this offering may profit the soul of thy servant, Leo," it was now said, "Grant us that by the intercession of thy servant, Leo, this oblation may profit us." Innocent tells him that scripture says that it is injurious to the saints to think they need to be prayed for when they are in life. As to how the change came about, he says nothing; but in looking for glory for the saints, it must be their being honoured among men, and refers to St. Augustine's statement, calling it scripture; thanksgiving for very good, prayer for middling good, and a solace to middling bad, and tells the archbishop that whether it be so he leaves to him to investigate. The poor pope made a sad blunder in quoting Augustine as scripture, for that word about martyrs is St. Augustine's. Thus the liturgy was changed: still the prayer for rest for those asleep in Christ remains. The force of this has been felt, and, in a modern Roman Catholic Prayer Book, approved by the Archbishop of New York, it is said to be for souls in purgatory, though it is expressly for all who rest in Christ *(omnibus quicscentibus in Christo*).

		As to the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, the incontestable meaning of the passage is that which is expressed in the Gospel of Mark; it "hath never forgiveness.<a name=337:12></a>" The Jews believed in an age to come, in which, under Messiah, there would be a fuller revelation of God's grace and favour than under the law; and, in a general way, they were right.<a name=337:13></a> The Lord declares that this sin would be forgiven in neither -- that is, never forgiven at all.<a name=337:14></a> Besides, this text, if applied as Roman Catholics apply it, would not prove purgatory, but deny eternal punishment, for purgatory is for those who <i>are</i> forgiven and justified.<a name=337:15></a> Hence this passage cannot apply to purgatory, for this sin is not to be forgiven, and it would mean that the unforgiven, the lost, would be forgiven in the next world.<a name=337:16></a> In Gregory the Great we find another view of purgatory.<a name=337:17></a> In general he rejects it, but admits it in a very small degree, referring to the last passage I have quoted.<a name=337:18></a> He quotes a number of passages to prove that we shall be in the day of judgment as we are when we die, and that now is the time to settle all with God -- John 12: 35; Isaiah 49: 8, quoted by Paul; 2 Corinthians 6: 2; Psalm 117 -- concluding from which sentences it is evident that such as any one goes out of this world, such he is presented in judgment.<a name=337:19></a> But, however, concerning certain light faults, it is to be believed that there is a purgatorial fire before the judgment, and he refers to 1 Corinthians 3 as the proof; but, however, as I said before, for little and the very smallest sins, such as "idle speech,<a href="#337:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> immoderate laughter, or the sin of carefulness in family matters," etc.<a name=337:20></a> And then he gives us an altogether novel explanation of the passage in 1 Corinthians.<a name=337:21></a> Augustine makes gold, etc.<a name=337:22></a>, to mean works so good that they stood the fire: for Jerome it was salvation without going through the fire at all; Gregory does not notice them, but speaks of iron, brass, lead -- such dreadful sins that men are wholly lost.<a name=337:23></a> He says, However the passage may be understood of the fire of tribulation applied to us in this life, however, if any one take it as speaking of the fire of future purgation, it is to be diligently considered that he says he can be saved through fire, not who shall have built on this foundation iron, brass, or lead -- that is, greater sins, and therefore harder, and then already insoluble -- but wood, hay, stubble, that is, the very smallest and lightest sins, which fire easily consumes.<a name=337:24></a>"<a href="#337:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a> (Dial.<a name=337:25></a> lib.<a name=337:26></a> 4, c.<a name=337:27></a> 39.<a name=337:28></a>) How fire consumes sins, every one must judge for himself.<a name=337:29></a>

Gregory thought the end of the world was close, and if people had lived very well, if they were not purified by tribulation here (to which Augustine also applies it), for some very small failings, they might be purified by a short process, before the judgment actually came.

		Scripture, not history, is the warrant for doctrine; but the historical fact is that half the church, and the oldest half of it, never held purgatory, nor do to this day (the other half, when expressing their personal faith, spoke in a way entirely contrary to it), but had, when the true knowledge of redemption was lost, and the purifying power of ceremonies and works came in, some mere vague notion of an intermediate state, or its possibility, or a purgatorial fire in the judgment of the last day, which ripened gradually <i>in the West</i> to the fact of a purgatory stated, as we have seen it, by Gregory at the end of the sixth century, but then only, if these were just, for very little sins, such as idle words.<a name=339:1></a> Before that prayers for the dead were offered, but then for all departed in peace, including the Virgin Mary.<a name=339:2></a> I give a specimen from Chrysostom: "We offer to thee this reasonable service for those that are absent in the faith -- our forefathers, fathers, patriarchs, prophets and apostles, preachers, evangelists, martyrs, confessors, religious persons, and every spirit perfected in the faith, but especially for all-holy, spotless, over-and-above-blessed, God-bearing, and ever-Virgin Mary.<a name=339:3></a>"

		What we have cited from Ambrose and Jerome has nothing to do with purgatory, but made judgment a temporary and purifying thing for all Christians, and was chiefly borrowed from Origen, admitted to be a heretic on all these points.<a name=350:20></a> But I will give you Augustine's statements, a good man, and partially led by what we have already looked at, but confessedly uncertain in his own mind; only he rejects positively the doctrines of the earlier Fathers, Origen, Ambrose, and Jerome.<a name=350:21></a> In the twenty-first book of <i>The City of God</i>, chapter 25, he had insisted that a man might outwardly partake of the Lord's supper, and not really receive Christ, that he who fed on Christ abode in Him, and that they were not members of Christ if in sin.<a name=350:22></a> Then he takes up the case of being burned (1 Corinthians 3), and first refers to tribulation.<a name=350:23></a> "So," he says, "as far as it appears to me, that fire is found"; and goes on to declare it cannot be the eternal fire, as some have said, into which those who are on the left hand are cast, and that only those who are set on the Lord's right hand go into that fire, inasmuch as they are saved, though their work is burnt; whereas those who go into the eternal fire will never be saved, but punished for ever (21, 26, 3).<a name=350:24></a> Then, in 4, "if in the interval between death and resurrection the spirits of the deceased are said to suffer this kind of fire, that their wood, hay, and stubble may be consumed, which those who have not such morals and affections in the life of this body will not feel, but those feel who have carried building of this sort with them, whether there only, or here and there, or therefore here, that it may not be there, they find fire of transitory tribulation, consuming worldly things, but pardonable as concerns eternal damnation, I do not controvert, for perhaps it is true.<a name=350:25></a>" Death may belong to it.<a name=350:26></a> "Persecution, in which martyrs are crowned, or which any Christians suffer, tries both kinds of building as fire, and if they do not find Christ in them, consumes some works and builders, some without the builders, if Christ be found," etc.<a name=350:27></a> He was a good man, and knew what it was to have Christ, and could not confound the substance of the matter with chaff, however dark he might be on a passage, and owns he was.<a name=350:28></a> "There will be, too, in the end of the age, tribulation in the time of Antichrist, such as never was.<a name=350:29></a>" Thus his own mind rests on tribulation.<a name=350:30></a> He utterly rejects Origen's notions, taken up by Ambrose and Jerome; but, as I said, is partially led by their views, so as to admit the possibility of another purifying fire when a true Christian had allowed evil in himself.<a name=350:31></a> The application of 1 Corinthians 3 to purgatory, Bellarmine assures us, is quite wrong, because there <i>every one's</i> work is tried, and that will not do for purgatory (Bell.<a name=350:32></a> de Purg.<a name=350:33></a>, lib.<a name=350:34></a> 1, C.<a name=350:35></a> 5, sect.<a name=350:36></a> 37, 38), and he rejects Augustine's own opinion, which is that of Gregory, that it is tribulation here (sect.<a name=350:37></a> 22, 26, 36).<a name=350:38></a> So little have we to trust in these doctors for unanimity of judgment.<a name=350:39></a> But in the tract on Faith and Works, 25 (15), this same Augustine utterly rejects the opinion of Ambrose and Jerome, though not naming them, and shews their views to be contrary to scripture where it is plainest, because of this, to him, obscure passage<a href="#350:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> in 1 Corinthians 3, and quotes 1 Corinthians 13; James 2: 14; 1 Corinthians 6: 9, 10; Galatians 5: 19-21.<a name=350:40></a> "All this will be false," he says, "if they are saved by fire who persevere in such evil things, if only they believe and are baptized.<a name=350:41></a> And thus the baptized in Christ even who do such things will possess the kingdom of God.<a name=350:42></a>" He adds a great deal more to the same purpose, which I need not quote.<a name=350:43></a> He then adds, 29 (16), "Perhaps it will be asked me here what I think of the sentence of the apostle Paul itself, and how I think it is to be understood.<a name=350:44></a> I confess I had rather hear more intelligent and learned persons, who shall so expound it, as that all those things which I have above recited should remain true and unshaken, and what I have not cited by which scripture most openly testifies that faith profits nothing save that which the apostle has defined, which works by love.<a name=350:45></a>" He says, however, he will explain, as well as he can, that if there is a faith which works by love, that faith will not suffer him to perish; he will be saved: but if he has with that allowed his heart to be attached to earthly things, "in losing them they suffer loss, and by a certain fire of grief arrive at salvation.<a name=350:46></a>" It is all poor and uncertain teaching, but of a godly man.<a name=350:47></a> On the same point, in the <i>Enchiridion</i> 18 (69), referring to the same passage, he says, "It is not incredible there may be some such thing after this life, and whether it be so may be inquired, and it may be discovered, or lay hid, that some of the faithful may be saved by a certain purifying fire; by how much they may have more or less loved perishing good things, by so much they may be more quickly or slowly saved.<a name=350:48></a>"

		<a class="footnote" name="#350:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>There is really no obscurity in it. The apostle is not speaking of man's works, but of ministry. The fruit of bad ministry comes to nothing, but the minister may be in Christ the foundation, and saved. If a real heretic, and corrupter of the temple of God, the workman will be destroyed too. We have three cases (a wise builder; a true Christian, who built badly; and a corrupter) with the consequence to each.

		Plato holds that the flesh is an evil part of the nature, which infects the soul, and that if it has wholly given itself up to vice, it would be given up to punishment for the advantage of others, as an example: if not, but that still any had not kept themselves free, they would be punished in hades for a certain time, proportioned to their unpurged stains; that there were two instruments for the health of the body, <i>exercise</i> (gymnastics) and <i>medicine</i>, and if the first were not sufficient, the other was to be applied; that the spots of the soul were like the colours after a wound when completely well.<a name=355:20></a> The soul, at the end of its purification and punishment, would be rendered splendid and spotless.<a name=355:21></a> That is simply purgatory -- purgatory from the natural need of the soul without Christ.<a name=355:22></a> Virgil enlarges a little on it: besides the torments of hell, he states the same process of punishment and purification, but he does not quite finish them off then; he sends them to elysium, a place of blessedness, and then, after a length of time, the hardened spots are wholly gone, and the ethereal soul is left quite pure.<a name=355:23></a> Other fictions were added; the souls quite pure, according to Plato, went off to the stars, according to their qualities, for they held (so Philo, the Jew) the stars to be living beings.<a name=355:24></a> All this was much borrowed from the Egyptians and Pythagoras.<a name=355:25></a> Hades was placed by them under the earth, and so by Romanists (as Bellarmine).<a name=355:26></a> This doctrine of purgatory was connected with the famous mysteries of Eleusis.<a name=355:27></a> It was signified in the rites, says Plato, that he who was not initiated and the unperfected in them would go to hades, and lie in mire, but that the purified and perfected person, when he departed, would dwell with the gods.<a name=355:28></a> So they held that there were those who answered to the Romish saints -- the heroes, who went to heaven at once, and were eternally happy.<a name=355:29></a> Here is Virgil's account of purgatory: "Moreover, when at the last ray life leaves, yet not every sorrow ceases to the unhappy, nor do bodily pains altogether pass, and it is altogether necessary that many things contracted by long usage should grow in a wonderful way into their very constitution.<a name=355:30></a> Therefore they are exercised with penal sufferings, and satisfy by punishment for the inveterate evils.<a name=355:31></a>" This is not Tartarus, the hell of the condemned, but souls that can be purified, who are not yet fit for elysium.<a name=355:32></a> You must not be surprised if we refer Roman Catholic doctrines to heathens, where we find exactly the same doctrine.<a name=355:33></a> All the language used of the sacraments by the Fathers is borrowed from heathen mysteries, and that even in the language of the liturgies.<a name=355:34></a>

		But there was another source historically of this doctrine (I say historically, for it was all the same reasoning of human nature that did not know the gospel of salvation) -- the Jewish doctrine.<a name=356:1></a> The Jews' notion (and the identity of thought is here also extraordinary) was this: they say (as Cyprian, Ambrose, and hosts of others) that there is no place of repentance after death.<a name=356:2></a> This the Fathers repeat continually; so the Jews.<a name=356:3></a> It is true; but where redemption is not known the only resource is to keep people from sin by terrifying the mind always by the dread of an avenging God, falsifying His character.<a name=356:4></a> But then they make almost all Jews get out of the place of punishment, because God has punished the best for all faults, and, after punishing the wicked, must crown what they have done right.<a name=356:5></a> Even if one commandment be kept, a Jew will be blest, so that, between that and Abraham's help and Moses', every child of Israel will see the world to come.<a name=356:6></a> God leans to the side of mercy, and it would not be just, they say, that a man suffered eternally for crimes which have often been light ones.<a name=356:7></a> Hence they have a purgatory for prevaricators in Israel, those who are not entirely good nor entirely bad.<a name=356:8></a> They pray to get souls out of it, and God releases them, and particularly at great days of expiation.<a name=356:9></a> It is even said that they sell indulgences to the people to get out quicker.<a name=356:10></a> Their purgatory is a part of hell beneath the earth.<a name=356:11></a> They judge that souls who have done both evil and good works will be punished for the evil, and then be rewarded for the good.<a name=356:12></a> So exactly says Origen (Hom.<a name=356:13></a> 16) on Jeremiah 5: 6, "If after you are on the foundation of Jesus Christ, you have gold, etc.<a name=356:14></a>, and wood, etc.<a name=356:15></a>, what would you have done to you when your soul quits your body?<a name=356:16></a> Would you enter into the holy place for the gold, etc.<a name=356:17></a>, to pollute God's kingdom, or stay out for the wood, and receive no reward for the gold," etc.<a name=356:18></a>?<a name=356:19></a> Yet neither is this just.<a name=356:20></a> He then quotes, "our God is a consuming fire," and says, there comes always blessing after threats and sorrow.<a name=356:21></a> And quoting falsely, I know not how, Isaiah 40, he insists on the word <i>first</i> ("I will first retribute double their iniquities"); first we shall suffer the torment for our iniquities, then be crowned for our righteousness.<a name=356:22></a> This is <i>exactly</i> Jewish.<a name=356:23></a>
