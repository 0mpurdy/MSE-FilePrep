		FAMILIAR CONVERSATIONS ON ROMANISM - SEVENTH CONVERSATION -- THE MASS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=1:1></a> Well, Mrs.<a name=1:2></a> James, good evening.<a name=1:3></a> I suppose James will be here.<a name=1:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>Mrs.<a name=1:5></a> James</i>.<a name=1:6></a> He will; for he went to see Bill M.<a name=1:7></a>, and they will come, I expect, together.<a name=1:8></a> Sit down, sir, if you please.<a name=1:9></a> They will soon be here; and the two gentlemen will, too, I suppose.<a name=1:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=1:11></a> Well, Mrs.<a name=1:12></a> James, and what do you say to what you have heard?<a name=1:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>Mrs.<a name=1:14></a> James</i>.<a name=1:15></a> I am very thankful for my husband, and for Bill M.<a name=1:16></a> It would have been a great grief if James had been led away from the truth.<a name=1:17></a> I could only look up that he might be kept.<a name=1:18></a> But to think of his being led into what I knew was false; and then the children!<a name=1:19></a> It was terrible!<a name=1:20></a> but God is very gracious.<a name=1:21></a> I was astonished at some things I heard; and it is a sorrowful thing to think that what the blessed Lord planted so fair and lovely by His Spirit, should have become so awfully corrupt.<a name=1:22></a> But I think, sir, when persons have known redemption and forgiveness themselves, and rest in Christ, they do not want all this.<a name=1:23></a> They have found a sure resting-place themselves in the work and Person of the Lord Jesus Christ -- can cry, Abba Father, in the consciousness of the present grace wherein they stand.<a name=1:24></a> They know that what they have got is the eternal grace and truth which came by Jesus Christ, who loved us and gave Himself for us; they trust that love; they have known and believed the love that God has to them: and their spirits are at rest in the love and favour of God.<a name=1:25></a> And I have found that these Romanists (but I do not say but some of them love Christ) are for slaving to gain His favour, and by penances, as if God wanted to torment them; and prayers, as if praying was not a delight and comfort, and none like it; and, after all, it ends in absolution and purgatory.<a name=1:26></a> It is not Christianity in which by divine love and God's righteousness we are reconciled to God and have peace.<a name=1:27></a> They seem never to have real peace.<a name=1:28></a> Satisfied some are, but no true peace with God, or they could not want to be working so to make it, seeing that Christ has died for us and we know God's love.<a name=1:29></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=2:1></a> It is most true; still I do not doubt that some of them love the Lord.<a name=2:2></a> There is piety, but no knowledge of redemption.<a name=2:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>Mrs.<a name=2:4></a> James</i>.<a name=2:5></a> I see some of them pious, but their piety is all mixed up with looking to the Virgin, who is not God, and never died for us, and of course could not; and to penances, and mortifying the body, and voluntary humility, as you know the scripture says, sir.<a name=2:6></a> Their piety is not true Christian grace and happiness, any more than their doctrines are Christian.<a name=2:7></a> I never saw one that had the liberty of the Spirit; and pretending still again to offer Christ must keep them there.<a name=2:8></a> They do not know what it is to believe that God has said "their sins and iniquities will I remember no more," because of Christ's precious offering of Himself, by which He has perfected for ever them that are sanctified.<a name=2:9></a> It is a blessing to think what the love of God has been to us.<a name=2:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=2:11></a> And is, Mrs.<a name=2:12></a> James: we dwell in it; at least that is the Christian's abode, even here below.<a name=2:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>Mrs.<a name=2:14></a> James</i>.<a name=2:15></a> It is true.<a name=2:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=2:17></a> But you are right; "He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself.<a name=2:18></a>" Well, we must pray for them, and that the word may be blessed to them; for it is sorrowful to think that the pious ones you speak of should be kept from the blessed liberty of divine favour in which Christ set us in Himself, and which we enjoy through the Holy Ghost.<a name=2:19></a> The last point you referred to is the one we are to take up this evening.<a name=2:20></a> But it is true that when a person really knows redemption, Romanism is at once to them a fable, and the very denial of Christianity; but how many pious persons, and not only among Romanists, but Protestants though mercifully preserved, who do not know redemption!<a name=2:21></a> I do not mean they deny it, perhaps have professedly no other hope, but who do not know it so as to possess its present peaceful effect by faith.<a name=2:22></a> How many there are who truly own Christ to be the Saviour, who think it presumptuous to be assured of forgiveness and salvation!<a name=2:23></a> Yet, Scripture is plain enough.<a name=2:24></a> In that day, when the Comforter would be come, they should know, it is written, they were in Christ and Christ in them.<a name=2:25></a> How can they cry, Abba Father, which is what distinguishes the Christian state, if they do not know they are children?<a name=2:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But here are your husband and Bill M.<a name=2:27></a> Good evening.<a name=2:28></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>James and Bill M</i>.<a name=3:1></a> Good evening, sir.<a name=3:2></a> I see the gentlemen are not here, so we are not too late.<a name=3:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=3:4></a> We were speaking, while waiting for you all, of the assurance of salvation, or at least had got on that point, when you came in.<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>Bill M</i>.<a name=3:6></a> I wish I had it.<a name=3:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=3:8></a> Well M.<a name=3:9></a>, it is the plain privilege of every simple believer.<a name=3:10></a> It is written, "He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life"; and again, "By him, all that believe are justified from all things.<a name=3:11></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>Bill M</i>.<a name=3:12></a> Well, I suppose then, I do not believe, for I cannot say that I have everlasting life, nor that I am justified.<a name=3:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=3:14></a> Your conclusion is not just.<a name=3:15></a> Do you not believe in your heart that the blessed Jesus is the Son of God?<a name=3:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>Bill M</i>.<a name=3:17></a> That I surely do; that is not what I doubt, but I do not know I have any part with Him; and the more I see the blessedness of it, and the more I know myself, the more I doubt.<a name=3:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=3:19></a> All this searching of heart is very useful; but, as to the truth, you see, God has pronounced in your case.<a name=3:20></a> You believe on the Son, and the word of God declares that whoever believes on Him has eternal life and is justified.<a name=3:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>Bill M</i>.<a name=3:22></a> I see; at least in my mind, I see it clear.<a name=3:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=3:24></a> What we are going to speak of may clear it up still more for you; still it must be a faith wrought by God in your soul.<a name=3:25></a> This doctrine of justification by faith was just what was brought out at the Reformation; and indeed they went too far then, so as yet to cloud it a little.<a name=3:26></a> They held that personal assurance of one's own salvation alone was justifying faith, and that is just what your reply amounted to; and this was condemned by the Council of Trent, as the vain confidence of the heretics.<a name=3:27></a> But this was the believing something about oneself, not about Christ; whereas Scripture presents Christ as the object of faith, and tells us judicially that he who believes on Him is justified.<a name=3:28></a> But Christ, not our own justification, is the object of faith, and we know it when we submit to God's judgment about it, instead of forming our own about our state, which must leave us in doubt.<a name=3:29></a> And we have to be humbled, and, as to this, emptied of self and self-righteousness in its subtler forms, to bow to God's way of justifying.<a name=3:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>Bill M</i>.<a name=3:31></a> But it is said somewhere we are to examine ourselves whether we are in the faith.<a name=3:32></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=4:1></a> The words are there; but it is only half a sentence, and cutting off the first half entirely changes the sense.<a name=4:2></a> The whole sentence is, "Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, .<a name=4:3></a>.<a name=4:4></a>.<a name=4:5></a> examine yourselves whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves.<a name=4:6></a>" "Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me" is an unfinished sentence; and before concluding it, there is a parenthesis which is evidently such, and then the original sentence is concluded with "examine yourselves," etc.<a name=4:7></a>, as already quoted.<a name=4:8></a> And the apostle immediately appeals to their certainty that they were Christians to shew their folly in questioning his apostleship.<a name=4:9></a> "Know ye not your own selves, how that Christ dwells in you except ye be reprobates?<a name=4:10></a>" How did he come there, if Christ had not spoken in him, for he had been the means of their conversion?<a name=4:11></a> Paul had been proving he was an apostle, which the false Judaising teachers had called in question, because he was not ordained and sent by Peter and the others.<a name=4:12></a> Paul appeals to his miracles and labour amongst them, and every other proof of his apostleship.<a name=4:13></a> And at last, reproaching them for their folly, says, "If I am not an apostle, how are you Christians?<a name=4:14></a> 'Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, examine yourselves.<a name=4:15></a>' If Christ did not speak by me you are not Christians, for, as he says, I have begotten you all by the gospel.<a name=4:16></a>" It was an unanswerable argument to them.<a name=4:17></a> They denied their own Christianity if they denied his apostleship.<a name=4:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>James</i>.<a name=4:19></a> I see plain enough; I never noticed that.<a name=4:20></a> Why, Bill, it is no precept to examine ourselves at all, but to them a confounding proof he was an apostle.<a name=4:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=4:22></a> It is all well to examine if we are walking up to it; but that is another thing.<a name=4:23></a> But tell me, M.<a name=4:24></a>, how should you like your children to inquire if they were your children?<a name=4:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>Bill M</i>.<a name=4:26></a> Nay, that would never do.<a name=4:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=4:28></a> Surely not.<a name=4:29></a> It would be ruinous.<a name=4:30></a> But if they were to examine themselves, and judge themselves as to whether they were dutiful children, walking up to the place and duty of children?<a name=4:31></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>Bill M.<a name=4:32></a> I</i> wish they always did.<a name=4:33></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=4:34></a> We see the difference clearly; and the latter is all right, provided it is done because we are children, and in the true confidence of a child in his father's love.<a name=4:35></a> We all pass through the other; and it is very natural, when we are in earnest, till we see redemption clearly; because we are inquiring what we are for God, not believing what He has been and what He has done for us.<a name=4:36></a> Now judging ourselves as to holiness of walk and living to Christ is all very right; but if I connect this with my acceptance, I have not learned God's love to me when a sinner, nor the efficacy of that work in the value of which I stand before God.<a name=4:37></a> It is in principle self-righteousness, though very useful to make us find we cannot make out any true righteousness.<a name=4:38></a> So the prodigal talks of being a hired servant before he met his father; once there and the father on his neck, that was all over; his place depended on what his father was for him, not what he was for his father; his fitness to go in was the best robe -- Christ.<a name=4:39></a> Yet he was going right from the time he came to himself.<a name=4:40></a> Never forget, M.<a name=4:41></a>, that our duties flow from the place we are already in.<a name=4:42></a> The duties are not the means of winning it, for they are not duties till you are in it.<a name=4:43></a> You cannot have the duties of a servant to me, because you are not such.<a name=4:44></a> Your children are bound to obey you, because they are your children.<a name=4:45></a>

		<i>N</i>.<a name=5:22></a> Assuredly we may deceive ourselves, and there are cases where warning may be timely; but that is the comfort of resting on God's word.<a name=5:23></a> This cannot deceive us.<a name=5:24></a> Your quotation from Ecclesiastes has no application to our Christian place.<a name=5:25></a> "Hereby know we love that he laid down his life for us.<a name=5:26></a>" Do we not know evil in the world's rejection of him, man's hatred against God?<a name=5:27></a> We know perfect love, and alas!<a name=5:28></a> perfect hatred in the cross.<a name=5:29></a> To say nothing of our own enjoyment of it, it is monstrous to apply this to the gospel or to the Christian.<a name=5:30></a> John says, "we have known and believed the love God hath to us.<a name=5:31></a>" "God hath commended his love to us, that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us"; surely we ought to believe in it.<a name=5:32></a> Ecclesiastes takes up what is done under the sun -- whether mortal man can find satisfying happiness here, and learns that all is vanity and vexation of spirit.<a name=5:33></a> It is not the revelation of grace in the Son of God.<a name=5:34></a>

		<i>James</i>.<a name=6:1></a> Pray be seated, gentlemen.<a name=6:2></a> We are all anxious to hear you on the subjects you spoke of.<a name=6:3></a> Bill M.<a name=6:4></a> knows more about it than I do; but we are both glad to hear what you have to say, and to know the truth.<a name=6:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>Bill M</i>.<a name=6:6></a> I should above all, if you are so kind, desire to hear about the Mass.<a name=6:7></a> It was made so much of with me, and seems the great point with the Catholics.<a name=6:8></a> They go to hear Mass, and say it brings people out of purgatory, and is for the remission of sins.<a name=6:9></a> I shall be glad to hear about transubstantiation, but this is a darker matter for me, which I do not much understand.<a name=6:10></a> But everything was made of the Mass with me; and if there is still a sacrifice for the remission of sins, it is a wonderful thing and no one should despise it.<a name=6:11></a> I see a great deal more than I did of the good of Christ's one sacrifice, but about the Mass I am not clear.<a name=6:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=6:13></a> If these gentlemen have no objection, then, we will begin with the Mass, and speak of transubstantiation afterwards.<a name=6:14></a> "He goes to Mass" is the very definition of a Roman Catholic, so to say.<a name=6:15></a> I do not think, important as it may be and is, it will keep us very long.<a name=6:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>R</i>.<a name=6:17></a> I have no objection, nor I suppose Mr.<a name=6:18></a> D.<a name=6:19></a> either.<a name=6:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=6:21></a> Well then, we will take up the doctrine of the Mass; we have ample authority as to the Roman Catholic doctrine on the subject, but we had better let Mr.<a name=6:22></a> R.<a name=6:23></a> make his own statement.<a name=6:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>R</i>.<a name=6:25></a> We must approach so holy and solemn a subject with reverence, but the proofs of the truth of it are as simple as they are strong.<a name=6:26></a> No religion in the world was ever without a sacrifice, and when men left the true God to worship idols, they still kept up this thought, identified, as it is, with the instincts of human nature, and sanctioned by the revelation of God, beginning with Abel, who was surely taught of God as to it, and developed in the sacrifices commanded to be offered under the law.<a name=6:27></a> It is impossible to believe that Christians -- the true religion of God -- should be left without any.<a name=6:28></a> Moreover it is contrary to the plain revelation of prophecy.<a name=6:29></a> Malachi declares as plainly as words can express it, "From the rising of the sun to the going down of the same my name is great among the Gentiles; and in every place there is a sacrifice, and there is offered to my name a clean oblation.<a name=6:30></a>" This is express.<a name=6:31></a> So we find in Genesis 14 that Melchisedec brought forth bread and wine, and (or indeed for) he was priest of the most high God.<a name=6:32></a> And Christ is a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec; so that bread and wine in connection with priesthood according to the order of Melchisedec is fully confirmed.<a name=6:33></a> I might adduce 1 Corinthians 10 where we read, "Ye cannot drink the chalice of the Lord and the chalice of devils; you cannot be partakers of the table of the Lord and of the table of devils," etc.<a name=6:34></a> Now the table of devils was their altar; hence we must clearly conclude that what is called the Lord's table is also an altar.<a name=6:35></a> This makes the institution of it by the Lord very plain which took place on the word,, "This do": in which the sacrifice was instituted, and they were consecrated priests with the command to offer it: for "doing" is a sacrificial word.<a name=6:36></a> We have also the uniform testimony of the Fathers from Justin Martyr, Clemens Alexandrinus, Cyprian, all of whom speak of this sacrifice and in the strongest terms.<a name=6:37></a> And it is not merely Catholics, but the whole professing church has accepted it -- Greeks and all sects which have sprung up -- outside the pale of the church.<a name=6:38></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=7>[Page 7]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>N</i>.<a name=7:1></a> Well, Mr.<a name=7:2></a> R.<a name=7:3></a>, you have fairly given the proofs alleged by Bellarmine, and even the Catechism of the Council of Trent.<a name=7:4></a> Milner does but repeat the same more briefly.<a name=7:5></a> One would say, he felt weak on the point.<a name=7:6></a> He refers back to what he had said in his letter on the means of sanctity as a motive for being brief -- a convenient cover for having little to say, if people do not refer to the letter; for there he has said nothing at all, save quoting Malachi, the universal resource, and the words of institution which he does in this letter on the Mass.<a name=7:7></a> Again Dr.<a name=7:8></a> Milner's definition of a sacrifice is clearly false and poor.<a name=7:9></a> He says, "it is an offering up and immolation of a living animal or other sensible thing to God in testimony that He is the master of life and death, the Lord of us and of all things.<a name=7:10></a>" Now, not to say that there were sacrifices which were not of living or sensible things under the law, as the meat offering, and confining myself to what was sacrifice in the full sense of it, all that he speaks of leaves out the question of sin altogether.<a name=7:11></a> The majesty of God is owned as having power over life and death, but upon the face of his definition no thought of sacrifice for sin has any place.<a name=7:12></a> The Council of Trent gives us no definition of sacrifice, but states pretty fully its doctrine of the Mass: only that the church has a visible sacrifice to represent Christ's bloody sacrifice, and that was to be permanent (Sess.<a name=7:13></a> 20, cap.<a name=7:14></a> 2), referring to the institution of the Lord's supper and Malachi's prophecy.<a name=7:15></a>

		Into what is said of the sacrifice of the Mass itself, I will go fully though briefly.<a name=8:1></a> I only note here how the idea of sacrifice is lost in its true value.<a name=8:2></a> Bellarmine's definition is "an external oblation made to God alone, which in acknowledgment of human infirmity and profession of the divine majesty, the object of the senses and permanent, by a lawful minister, is by a mystic rite consecrated and transmuted" (Bell.<a name=8:3></a> de Sacr.<a name=8:4></a> Euch.<a name=8:5></a> 10 Lib.<a name=8:6></a> 5, cap.<a name=8:7></a> 2, 26 ) This would lead us very little to a just thought of the sacrifice of Christ.<a name=8:8></a> The Catechism of the Council of Trent, De Eucharistia Sacramento, cap.<a name=8:9></a> 4, 71, gives its being offered to God as the essential difference between sacrament and sacrifice in the Eucharist.<a name=8:10></a> But leaving these generalities, valuable only as shewing the vagueness and unsatisfactoriness of the Roman Catholic idea of a sacrifice, I turn to that on which it is precise enough, the sacrifice of the Mass.<a name=8:11></a> That is a propitiatory sacrifice available for the sins not only of the living but of the dead -- truly propitiatory.<a name=8:12></a> (Conc.<a name=8:13></a> Trid.<a name=8:14></a> Sess.<a name=8:15></a> 22, 2 ) Christ is unbloodily immolated there.<a name=8:16></a> The decree of the Council, after grossly misapplying Hebrews 4: 16, which speaks of Christ's priesthood in heaven, not of sacrifice, adds, "for by the offering of him [Christ] the Lord is appeased granting grace and the gift of penitence, forgives crimes and sins, even very great ones [ingentia]: for it is one and the same victim, the same one now offering by the ministry of priests, who then offered himself on the cross, the manner of offering alone being different.<a name=8:17></a> Wherefore it is rightly offered according to the traditions of the apostles, not only for the sins, punishments, satisfactions, and other necessities of the faithful who are alive, but also for the dead in Christ not yet fully purged.<a name=8:18></a>" So in the Catechism of the Council of Trent somewhat more fully (Part 2 De Eu.<a name=8:19></a> Sacr.<a name=8:20></a> 76 ) "The Mass is and ought to be considered one and the same sacrifice with that of the cross, for the victim is one and the same .<a name=8:21></a>.<a name=8:22></a>.<a name=8:23></a> .<a name=8:24></a> The bloody and unbloody are not two but only one victim whose sacrifice is daily renewed in the Eucharist .<a name=8:25></a>.<a name=8:26></a>.<a name=8:27></a> .<a name=8:28></a> The priest is also one and the same, Christ the Lord.<a name=8:29></a>" And alleges as proof that the priest does not say 'This is Christ's body,' but 'This is my body.<a name=8:30></a>'" It is a truly propitiatory sacrifice by which God is appeased and rendered propitious to us .<a name=8:31></a>.<a name=8:32></a>.<a name=8:33></a> .<a name=8:34></a> For so delighted is the Lord with the odour of this victim, that, bestowing on us the gifts of grace and repentance, He pardons our sins.<a name=8:35></a> Hence this usual prayer of the church 'as often as the commemoration of this victim is celebrated, so often is the work of our salvation being done.<a name=8:36></a>'"

		It is even more distinct in expression than the Council of Trent.<a name=9:1></a> Its benefits extend "to all the faithful whether living with us on earth, or already numbered with those who are dead in the Lord, but whose sins have not yet been fully expiated.<a name=9:2></a>" This is very plain.<a name=9:3></a> Christ offers Himself visibly, permanently, or renewedly (both expressions are used); often, daily renewed, is the expression in the Catechism.<a name=9:4></a> This sacrifice, offered by Christ, appeases God, is propitiation for the sins of the living and of the dead in Christ when they are not fully purged, says the Council of Trent; 'expiated,' says the Catechism of the Council of Trent, 'confers pardon of sins,' besides many other graces.<a name=9:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Does Christianity recognise this?<a name=9:6></a> It not only does not do so, but with diligent care expressly denies it in every part.<a name=9:7></a> It is instituted, we are told, that the church might have a perpetual sacrifice by which our sins might be expiated and our heavenly Father turned from wrath to mercy.<a name=9:8></a> Let me make a remark in passing that the statement that the priest's saying 'This is my body' shews he represents Christ is a mere fallacy.<a name=9:9></a> It is in the Mass a recital of what Christ said at the last supper.<a name=9:10></a> The canon of the Mass says, "who" (Jesus Christ) "the day before he suffered took bread in his holy and venerable hands .<a name=9:11></a>.<a name=9:12></a>.<a name=9:13></a> saying, Take and eat all of this, for this is my body.<a name=9:14></a>" They are clearly and only the words of Christ the day before He suffered.<a name=9:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		To clear my way I would say that sacrifice lies at the basis of all relationship of man with God.<a name=9:16></a> But at the same time such an expression as turning our heavenly Father from wrath by it is not by itself a true or scriptural way of putting it; though Protestant confessions have continued it on from Rome.<a name=9:17></a> God is a righteous Judge, and the atonement was absolutely necessary that grace might reign through righteousness.<a name=9:18></a> But the origin and source of all is left out in this statement.<a name=9:19></a> God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son.<a name=9:20></a> The Son of man must be lifted up, the holy victim be offered up.<a name=9:21></a> But where to find it?<a name=9:22></a> The love of God saw us all lost sinners, and did not spare His own Son for us.<a name=9:23></a> Christ "through the eternal Spirit offered himself up without spot to God"; nay, in the same love, said, "Lo, I come to do thy will, O God.<a name=9:24></a>" But if righteousness required the propitiation, love provided the victim.<a name=9:25></a> Grace reigns through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=9:26></a>" And this changes the whole character of the gospel; God's love was the source and origin of it all, though it became God to make the Captain of our salvation perfect through suffering.<a name=9:27></a> As the apostle John states it, "But we have seen and do testify that the Father sent his Son to be the Saviour of the world.<a name=9:28></a>" The Father's wrath indeed is not a scriptural expression at all; God's wrath is.<a name=9:29></a> A Father is the Father of His children.<a name=9:30></a>

		That the heathen took up sacrifice from corrupted traditions of the truth and the necessity of the human heart, I believe with Mr.<a name=10:1></a> R.<a name=10:2></a>, and do not doubt that Abel's offering was by God's will, for Abel we are told offered it by faith; Hebrews 11.<a name=10:3></a> That in Christianity there is a sacrifice, I admit as truth and vital truth, the basis of our relationship with God, as what I need for my own salvation.<a name=10:4></a> Indeed, I do not doubt a moment that all other sacrifices from Abel on rested on divine and divinely taught reference to this, the heathen sacrifice, being corruptly derived from this original source, connected with false ideas of God, namely, that the gods were hating and jealous beings who had to be won, a thought which still exists in corrupted Christianity.<a name=10:5></a>

		But you will remark, Mr.<a name=10:6></a> R.<a name=10:7></a>, that the early sacrifices were bloody sacrifices.<a name=10:8></a> The law, in special figures of Christ, introduced meat-offerings along with these, and most interesting is the instruction they afford; but what was essential was that death and the shedding of blood should come in, because therein man owned that sin and death by sin had come in, and that only by the death of another could man come to God.<a name=10:9></a> Abel came with this; Cain with what cost him far more toil and labour, but which did not own sin and death, and separation-from God, and was rejected with his offering.<a name=10:10></a> What first effectually covered man's nakedness was that God clothed him with the skins of <i>slain</i> beasts.<a name=10:11></a> Man's state in sin, death, and separation from God was owned, and met.<a name=10:12></a> This (which is of the essence of the one true sacrifice and carefully set forth in the earliest types to which you and I both refer, as making the essential difference of what was necessary and acceptable to God, as all their sacrifices, and peremptorily the difference of Cain and Abel's demonstrate) is wholly left out in Milner's and Bellarmine's definition of a sacrifice.<a name=10:13></a> When we remember what the sacrifice of the Mass is, it is not difficult to understand why.<a name=10:14></a> If death and the shedding of blood be essential to an acceptable sacrifice, the Mass, avowedly an unbloody sacrifice, and so called, is not really one at all.<a name=10:15></a> A commemoration or memorial of such it may be, but not itself such.<a name=10:16></a> It fails in what is essential, and, I must add, denies the whole true ground of relationship with God; it legitimates Cain's sacrifice which God rejected.<a name=10:17></a>

		As to Melchisedec, if the bread and wine were an offering to God, a priestly service, is it not strange that the Epistle to the Hebrews makes not the slightest allusion to it?<a name=23:1></a> And though Christ be priest after the order of Melchisedec, when the word speaks of the exercise of Christ's priesthood, it is uniformly a comparison with what Aaron did, and the Jewish sacrifices.<a name=23:2></a> In the Old Testament there is not the most distant hint of his offering to God.<a name=23:3></a> Melchisedec was a priest on his throne on earth, not a sufferer on the cross; there was no death in his case, but a testimony that he lives.<a name=23:4></a> He brings forth the bread and wine, but bringing forth is no offering.<a name=23:5></a> You are obliged to say with Bellarmine, We must <i>suppose</i> that he did so, admitting he brought it out to Abraham to eat, but that he must be supposed to have offered it first.<a name=23:6></a> In the account, they cannot deny, there is no trace of it.<a name=23:7></a> Now Melchisedec is a figure of Christ when He takes to Him His great power, and reigns as king of righteousness over the earth.<a name=23:8></a> <i>Now</i> He exercises His priesthood after the similitude of Aaron in the holy place-heaven itself as Hebrews teaches us -- which Melchisedec does not at all.<a name=23:9></a> But when Christ takes His own throne, it is He who <i>has</i> suffered and offered the one sacrifice, and therefore, as Melchisedec, He has none to offer; He confers the blessing contained in the revelation of the Most High God, possessor of heaven and earth, on those who belong to Him and have conquered.<a name=23:10></a> As Melchisedec, He has no sacrifice to offer, because this has been done once for all.<a name=23:11></a> Now His service is different; He is gone within the veil, not without blood, and there, we know, sits on the Father's throne, at the right hand of God till His enemies be made His footstool.<a name=23:12></a> Then the rod of His power will go out of Sion.<a name=23:13></a> But His present exercise of priesthood is not according to Melchisedec, as the Epistle to the Hebrews fully shews.<a name=23:14></a>

		I add that Bellarmine's statement, that Judges 6: 18, 19, shews that the Hebrew word used for brought forth signifies priestly offering, has no foundation.<a name=23:15></a> Gideon brought out meat, and broth, and cakes, and Jehovah turned it by His power into a sacrifice; but the word does not mean "offering"; <i>habi</i> does, because it is the opposite to this word.<a name=23:16></a> <i>Yatsa</i> is "brought out"; <i>bo</i> is "brought in or nigh.<a name=23:17></a>" The last is used for bringing up to be a sacrifice, which means the contrary to bringing forth <i>(yatsa)</i>.<a name=23:18></a> But on their own shewing there is no statement of any offering in Melchisedec bringing forth bread and wine, because they are forced to suppose that the offering had been made before it was brought forth.<a name=23:19></a> All this, as I have said, I have answered because it is alleged; but it is a mere lame attempt to get up some evidence out of nothing by far-fetched reasoning, the difficulty of answering being, that there is no tangible reason for it -- nothing really to answer.<a name=23:20></a> I rest on the great fact that the Epistle to the Hebrews, and the truth of Christianity, deny and reject altogether the whole doctrine of the Mass.<a name=23:21></a>

		The learned editor of the Venetian edition of the works of Gregory the Great, after the Benedictines of St.<a name=25:1></a> Maur, published with the permission and privilege of the superior authorities, has another system in his Isagoge (9, B.<a name=25:2></a> 169 c.<a name=25:3></a>, 3, 15, 16), and one that shews more reverence at least.<a name=25:4></a> He says that the offering may be of a victim to be immolated, or that has been immolated, confounding the bringing the victim up to be a victim, and the actual offering when slain, on the altar.<a name=25:5></a> He holds that Christ offered Himself to God at the institution of the Supper, and was an actual victim on the cross.<a name=25:6></a> Now He is offered, though still alive, like the scapegoat, as one who has been slain as a victim.<a name=25:7></a> The slaying is thus on the cross; the Mass only an offering.<a name=25:8></a> Others, he says, put the force of the sacrifice on the slaying of the victim; we in the offering of a victim slain or to be slain.<a name=25:9></a> They will have sacrifice to be instituted as a declaration of God's supreme dominion over His creatures; we to represent Christ's death.<a name=25:10></a> Surely he has more truth here.<a name=25:11></a> Milner takes the other view, but his illustration from the scapegoat is unhappy, because he goes away with his sins on him.<a name=25:12></a> Did Christ do that after being a victim?<a name=25:13></a> For so he takes it in connection with the goat, whose blood was put on the mercyseat.<a name=25:14></a> The editor of Gregory closes by saying whichever opinion seems the truer and stronger to maintain the Catholic dogma against the innovators, let each follow, mindful of that word, in what is necessary unity; in doubtful liberty; in all charity.<a name=25:15></a> But this is a poor uncertainty to get forgiveness and grace by, the evident effect of trying to make a sacrifice of what is not one, resulting too in making uncertain altogether what it consists in.<a name=25:16></a> In this writer's case, the consumption on the altar being the only true offering after being slain, this second offering after being slain cannot take place now.<a name=25:17></a> It is really mere remembrance.<a name=25:18></a> Indeed he says pretty nearly as much (c.<a name=25:19></a> 12, page 168) There is a sufficiently plain testimony moreover, of the representative nature of our sacrifice in those words of Christ, "As oft as ye shall do these things, do it in remembrance of me"; and he adds a good deal more, that in doing this continually in commemoration of that (the bloody sacrifice), we confess by act that Christ is entered once into the holy place, eternal redemption being found.<a name=25:20></a>

		It is evident that the Roman Canon of the Mass bears tokens of an earlier doctrine and usage on the subject, inasmuch as before consecration the priest offers it for the holy Catholic church; then speaks, in the commemoration for the living, of sacrifice of praise; and then, after the commemoration of the dead saints, prays that the Lord appeased may accept the oblation, and that He would deign to make it blessed and acceptable, that it may become to them the body and blood of His most beloved Son.<a name=34:6></a> Then he recites Christ's act and words, "for this is my body," and then adores the host, then consecrates the cup adding several words to what Christ said, and adores it, and then offers the host, but calling it God's gift -- <i>de tuis donis et datis</i>, and then, strange to say, begs God may deign to regard it with a propitious and serene countenance, and accept it as God did Abel's, which, if they believed it to be really Christ, would be nonsense or a blasphemy; and then prays that it may be carried by the hand of God's holy angel to His altar on high in sight of His divine Majesty.<a name=34:7></a>

	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#34:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>It is curious enough too that the Canon of the Mass, in speaking of the cup, says (following the Vulgate), not 'is poured out,' but 'shall be poured out,' referring to the sacrifice as a yet unaccomplished thing. 'There was no need so to put it according to the Greek. It is simply 'poured out,' or 'being poured out'; but Jerome has given it historically, having no idea of sacrifice in the institution save as it referred to the cross.

		But I take the matter up broadly, and say, The scripture never recognises a person uncertain of his salvation as in a Christian state.<a name=42:10></a> Certainty or uncertainty has nothing to do with humility.<a name=42:11></a> If it be uncertain whether a child be really the child of his parent, this has nothing to do with his humility; he may not have the shadow of a question as to his being such, and be a humble obedient child.<a name=42:12></a> But true divinely given certainty brings us into the place of humility, because, where real, it brings us into the presence of God through the rent veil of Christ's sufferings to walk in the light as God is in the light.<a name=42:13></a> There we feel our own utter nothingness, how far we are from having reached the mark; and all is seen in that light.<a name=42:14></a> Yet we have confidence, because grace has brought us there, and we know God is love and loves us infinitely.<a name=42:15></a> It is said, the love wherewith He loves Jesus, and that He accepts us because of, and by, and according to, the value of the perfect work of Jesus, who appeared once in the end of the world to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself.<a name=42:16></a> Through His offering we have no more conscience of sins -- perfected for ever as to acceptance by His one offering.<a name=42:17></a> The Lord has given us the picture of this uncertain state in the prodigal son.<a name=42:18></a> When he had not yet met his father, though his heart was turned by grace towards him, he says, "Make me as one of thy hired servants.<a name=42:19></a>" There was no certainty or enjoyment of the relationship.<a name=42:20></a> When he met his father, there was no such word uttered.<a name=42:21></a> What his father was to him was known because he had met him; the thought of being treated as a servant only proved he had not met him yet.<a name=42:22></a> There is a new nature in him who is born of God which loves holiness, but there is no true development of holy affections until we are at peace with God.<a name=42:23></a> And the Mass denies the ground of our relationship with Him, the holy and righteous God, and the true scripturally revealed value of Christ's work.<a name=42:24></a>

		THE DISTINCT CHARACTER OF THE SEVERAL WRITINGS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are some subjects difficult to establish in mere ordinary statement, because their proof results not from palpable evidences of facts, or positive testimony cognisable by sense or intellect, but from characteristic exhibition; the apprehension of which implies both capacity for understanding its nature, and habitual exercise on the subject before us.<a name=46:1></a> The perception, however, of them may be conducive to a fuller entering on the whole scope of truth and its order.<a name=46:2></a> It is the peculiar character of minds of power (communicative power) in natural subjects to seize the prominent features which may act on the mind of others, in introducing the perception of or controlling the mind to subjection to these points as manifested truth; associating their minds with the principles of truth.<a name=46:3></a> In spiritual subjects, it is the object of much distinct converse in them to be able to present them primarily and vividly, so as to lead the way to fuller investigation of the divine mind.<a name=46:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The expression of one's own thoughts, and the acting so as to awaken similar thoughts in others, I find by experience to be two very different things; and the latter to be a rarer and more self-denying attainment than the other.<a name=46:5></a> By God's Spirit alone can it be done in power.<a name=46:6></a> I find myself utterly deficient in this power, and I feel that I must charge upon myself failure in spirituality in respect to this.<a name=46:7></a> I am led into this by an effort to present some thoughts, the result of habitual reference to the subject, which have grown up in my mind, strengthened after their first suggestion, not by an elaborately attempted proof, but by the continual development of them in subjects to which they refer -- the best proof I find in scriptural subjects, and one to me the least communicable to others.<a name=46:8></a> But I shall state, as simply as I can, the thoughts, and leave their development where chiefly they will be found of value in the daily course of Christian reading.<a name=46:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I allude to this -- I believe that the Gospels are by no means mere concurrent and coincident testimonies to Christ, and valuable simply as corroborative one of the other.<a name=46:10></a> Of course they are so, nor do I despise this positive help to the acknowledgement of the instrument and standard of faith -- the written word.<a name=46:11></a> But the believer, acknowledging this as his foundation, seeks for the enlargement of heart which the fuller and more complete apprehension of that word may give him.<a name=46:12></a> I believe them to be (recognised as true and all bearing witness to the same great facts, and shewing thus their unity) the testimony of the Holy Ghost to distinct characters, in which the one Person they bear record of was revealed, and which He filled.<a name=46:13></a> All fulness dwelt in Him, not only of the Godhead bodily as to His Person, but the accomplishment of every character in which He could meet the requisition of God from man, and man's necessities, or satisfy the testimony of the Holy Ghost in the word of old, as exhibiting the divine glory.<a name=46:14></a> He came in "by the door," so that to Him the porter should open; and thus He became "the door," the only door in or out, to all else.<a name=46:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=47>[Page 47]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the Gospels generally fill up their peculiar place in their witness in this respect; they fill up the place of representing Jesus from His birth to the resurrection, sealed by His ascension into heaven, wherein He became properly the last Adam -- the spring from which all the ministration of the living word flowed, and on which it was established -- and the testimony of the righteousness of God set forth as His glory to be revealed.<a name=47:1></a> That is, all that Jesus was, is that which will be exhibited in glory: we see its substance, its texture, the beautiful order of all its filaments in His unglorified state; yet is He none of these things which He is meant to be, that is -- save to faith.<a name=47:2></a> The glory exhibits it to the world.<a name=47:3></a> The artist skilled in the composition of the structure can see the exquisiteness of its parts -- the nicely adapted arrangement of the materials -- the perfect wisdom with which it is composed.<a name=47:4></a> Its presenting as a whole to the world will give the whole result externally.<a name=47:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He was the Son of man in all the varied moral truth which that name conveys; He will be the Son of man in glory.<a name=47:6></a> He was the Messiah in all the requisitions and gifts which had been appointed, and even recorded by prophets; He will be Messiah in the reign of His glory.<a name=47:7></a> He was the Son of God in His Person, as conversant in the world; He will appear in His glory as Son.<a name=47:8></a> As the potter's work goes in with all with which it will come out, yet would the eye unpractised see nothing of its beauty -- none but the potter could see it; so none but one eye, and those taught of Him, can see the exquisite beauty which was in all this fulness of Jesus, or understand the beauty and glory and true majesty, in which He shall be revealed when every eye shall see Him.<a name=47:9></a> They "saw no beauty in him that they should desire him"; yet He was but cast into the fire that He might come forth to their astonishment with all the beauty which God could set upon Him -- "his Father's glory and his own" -- the glory of administered power, in the glory, the results of grace -- "to be glorified in his saints, and admired in all them that believed.<a name=47:10></a>" Nothing can exceed the delight and profit I apprehend, through perception and connection of this glory of what Jesus was, in the veiled perhaps, but heightened and beauteous order of all His character in grace, with the glory in which it shall be revealed in the day of His appearing to His saints and the excellency of His kingdom.<a name=47:11></a>

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=48>[Page 48]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The testimony and ministrations founded on these great truths, as building the church upon them belong to the Epistles and the subsequent contents of the New Testament, and not to the Gospels, whose office it is to state the facts, and develop in conversations the universal truths on which it is founded.<a name=48:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, there are three great characters besides His personal biography, in which the Lord is set forth: as the Messiah; as the Second Man known in the moral character of the divine nature which God required, the Last Adam; and, which is the climax of them all, His personal glory from which all flows as Son of God.<a name=48:2></a> First, His character properly Jewish; secondly, that in which it was co-extensive with the term man, and applied itself to this as coming from the hands of God; thirdly, that in which it was paramount to either, His personal association with the Father of glory as the Son of God, in which the value was attached to the others; and the power of quickening, in which alone they could have unity, was established and verified.<a name=48:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This, I say (as establishing promises, exhibiting grace, and founding the stability of both, in the Person of Him in whom they were fulfilled, with the personal grace and graciousness of His conversation and ministry in the world) forms the respective subjects, more especially of the four Gospels.<a name=48:4></a> We find them exhibited in John 11 and 12; that is, the Saviour exercised or owned in them by His power and the ordering of the divine counsels on His rejection by the Jews.<a name=48:5></a> Chapter 11 exhibits His resurrection power after that rejection "for the glory of God, and that the Son of God should be glorified thereby"; chapter 12, His kingship over the Jews as the Son of David, and, secondly, His headship over the Gentiles, His standard of conversion and attractive power in death, in that which took place in the desire of the Greeks to see Jesus.<a name=48:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=49>[Page 49]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Of the first of these characters which I have mentioned, Messiah, the Lord's connection with the Jews, Matthew is the appointed witness.<a name=49:1></a> Of course, the same truths are recognised everywhere.<a name=49:2></a> Luke exhibits our Lord in His converting character, and detecting in moral principles the inconsistency of man's estate with the divine character.<a name=49:3></a> John eminently presents Him in His Person and Sonship.<a name=49:4></a> Matthew, as fulfilling the law and the promises, "the minister [as the apostle speaks] of the circumcision for the truth of God"; Luke, as a witness of what is in man, and of the openness of the Father's house, and the love of the Father's heart to them that return, to the returning prodigal, "that the Gentiles should glorify God for his mercy"; John tells us that "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and was God .<a name=49:5></a>.<a name=49:6></a>.<a name=49:7></a> and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.<a name=49:8></a>" I believe the notice of this conduces exceedingly to the understanding of the different Gospels.<a name=49:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The evidences of it are some of them obvious, others more from use.<a name=49:10></a> We have one immediate one in the genealogies traced up in Matthew, to the sources of Jewish dispensation, David and Abraham; in Luke, to Adam, the Son of God.<a name=49:11></a> Again, if anyone will compare the first two chapters of Matthew and Luke, they will see how completely the one is appropriately Jewish; the other presents us with the child,<a href="#49:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> one who "grew in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.<a name=49:12></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thing is remarkable; it will be found on examination, that, except in the positive necessary facts of His birth and death, Luke states circumstances, not according to their chronological order, but according to their moral connection; hence affording a most important link of interpretation.<a name=49:13></a> This is so, not merely in unconnected facts, where it is obvious, but even in the temptation in the wilderness.<a name=49:14></a> The sermon on the Mount, the character of the parables, of which Matthew 13 and Luke 15 may be taken as the types, all confirm and illustrate the position I am taking; and this is the real interpretation of the different language used in parallel passages.<a name=49:15></a> In one, the Holy Ghost preserved what bore upon the subject of one Gospel; in the other, what bore upon that of the other, and gave what the church needed, and God pleased: if all had been given, "the world could not have contained the books.<a name=49:16></a>" The whole of Luke 7 and 8 illustrate in a string of circumstances the moral application of facts.<a name=49:17></a> A comparison of the closing scenes of our Lord's intercourse with His disciples and the Jews, and the prophecies consequent thereupon, further remarkably illustrate the difference.<a name=49:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#49:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>Till His birth, however, there is no allusion to anything but Jewish hopes; the passage which seems so is a mistranslation -- "to you and all people" should be "to you and to all the people," Luke 2: 10.

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=50>[Page 50]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Matthew is given the full development of Jewish dispensation, and this so much so, that I could not apply any of the statements in Matthew 24 or the like to Gentile circumstances; whereas Luke explicitly opens the door, and brings them into the scene, as may be seen in the close of chapter 21 Whence also, I believe He introduces "all the trees," the fig-tree being the specific emblem of the Jewish corporate nationality.<a name=50:1></a> The close of the Gospel of John is equally distinct, or more evidently so in its character.<a name=50:2></a> But I do not feel in this synoptical view, that I need enter into any explanation of the Gospel of John.<a name=50:3></a> It is evident upon the face of it, that the Person of our Lord, as paramount to dispensation, though as coming subject to it, is its declaration.<a name=50:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Gospel of Mark I believe to be the declaration of the personal ministry of our Lord, "the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God," and the circumstances of that ministry, to trace from circumstance to circumstance the character of minister in our Lord, His personal character, not in broad facts or prophecies the Messiahship, the faithful and true Witness, the Lord from heaven, the Son of God, one with the Father, but He who was all these become the patient considerate Servant, in actual ministry of those with whom He was conversant.<a name=50:5></a> Hence it commences with His ministry or baptism, giving no account of His birth.<a name=50:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When I retrace at all the enjoyment which I have had through the Spirit of grace, and of God, in that from which these observations are drawn, the studying our Lord in them, I am doubly conscious how little they can in any sort convey to another the resources of that enjoyment; nor indeed can this be.<a name=50:7></a> All I can hope is, that they may be the instruments of leading the minds of others into the same sources or streams, in which the infinitude, the unspeakable infinitude, of divine grace flows from and in Him in whom they are all concentrated, and concentrated for us, even Jesus the Lord, in whom "dwelt all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.<a name=50:8></a>" It is in communion with Him in the word, that these blessings are found; and communion whose depth, whose height, is never reached, but the fulness is ours, and that in the very peaceful strength in which He has adapted Himself to us.<a name=50:9></a> May He open our mouths in the understanding of His praise.<a name=50:10></a> It is this, after the establishment of our faith in the great truths of the Epistles, explanatory truths, that leads us back to the Gospels, to enter into and dwell upon the blessedness and fulness of Him in whom all the truths have their centre and accomplishment.<a name=50:11></a>

		While my own mind rests specially on the Gospels in this view, as illustrating the Person of our Lord, I add at the wish of some a short synoptical view of the books of the whole New Testament, which will, at the same time, strengthen and confirm the remarks I have made upon the Gospels.<a name=51:1></a> It appears to me to be a presenting of Christ, the subject-matter of the faith which is in Christ Jesus, from His incarnation, which associates Him with David, and Abraham, and Adam, and presents Him as the substantiation of the mind of God, of which they are but prefigurements, though real ones, to the time when He shall return again -- His second coming, when He shall illustrate all that He is in power.<a name=51:2></a> Hence, in the Gospels, we have all that He was traced to Adam, David, Abraham, the Word of God, and shewn forth in ministry with the great facts on which the testimony of the gospel was founded.<a name=51:3></a>

		In the Acts we have the founding of the church of Christ, stating His resurrection and ascension, on which the Jewish and Gentile church is built, the outpouring of the Holy Spirit -- the Acts not of the apostles, but of the apostles Peter and Paul (though recognising of course the others, particularly those who seemed to be pillars), that is, of the apostles of the circumcision and uncircumcision the ordering of the church by the deacons; the subministration by evangelists, deacons "who have purchased to themselves a good degree and great boldness in Christ Jesus"; the general diffusion of the word of the gospel by all the faithful preaching (Acts 8: 4); and the foundation of the Gentile church, more peculiarly so called, on the ascended glory of Christ, that it might be "Christ in them the hope of glory," with the ordering by the Spirit of all their labours.<a name=51:4></a>

		We have, then, in the Epistles, the ordering and care of the church and churches of Christ thus planted, in their various necessities, arising from the weakness of men, and permitted thus to arise that we, "upon whom the ends of the world are come," might have the answer, the rescript of God upon the case.<a name=52:1></a> In the Epistle to the Galatians, we have the great basis laid of justification by faith, and its connected doctrines, to the exclusion of all judaising to such an end.<a name=52:2></a> In the Romans we have a whole body of divinity in the way of dispensation, justly coming first, to chapter 8, developing all that was short of "no condemnation" -- stating the whole of the Christian position in chapter 8, on the basis of thanksgiving for Christ; and from chapter 9 out, tracing the positive dispensations of God ordered beforehand, and resulting therefrom, closing with practice and a resume of the whole dispensation.<a name=52:3></a> In the two Epistles to the Corinthians we have the internal order and management of a church by the Spirit of God in the apostle.<a name=52:4></a> It would appear as if there had been no elders, that we might have direct from the apostle the arrangements necessary and pleasing to God for the purposes of the divine order; at least, elders do not at all appear throughout the books, but the directions are immediate to the church.<a name=52:5></a> I think this a remarkable and singular providence; to us at least it is so, and worthy of notice.<a name=52:6></a> For surely no goodness and provision for our weakness and folly is singular with God; boundless, multiplied, have they been.<a name=52:7></a> There are some who would despise it, as of little or no profit for the purpose for which it is given.<a name=52:8></a> What else is it for?<a name=52:9></a> I can conceive nothing more base than, having by perverseness disabled one's self from the use of means which God has provided, to turn round and say the means are deficient, without a symptom of humiliation for the real cause.<a name=52:10></a>

		The Ephesians and Colossians bear many stamps of identity of purpose, but they are very beautifully distinct.<a name=52:11></a> They both follow up the dispensation into its fulness; but the Ephesians views it in the glory, the conferred or predestinated glory of the body -- the Son's; the Colossians looks at the fulness of the Head of the body, as constituting that, through which the whole is brought into this order in and by the Head.<a name=52:12></a> The Philippians I would give as depicting the affectionate interchange of love in the intercourse between the parental apostle and his beloved and attached churches.<a name=52:13></a> Thus he unfolds his hopes, for in this way does the doctrine come out, and leads them in the same healthful train, opening the blessed truths to them, and so of his estate and thoughts of theirs.<a name=52:14></a>

		The two to the Thessalonians are the building of the church in the great doctrine of the Lord's second coming, as an immediate and protracted expectation and hope, and the result of this special apprehension of it in the very healthful state of the church.<a name=53:1></a> These epistles afford very full doctrine on the subject, and guard against the only prejudices which the vanity or wit of man could form out of it or abuse.<a name=53:2></a> I need hardly say, that Timothy and Titus are the ordering of the church, as to its government and management by those set over it in the Lord (justly coming last with others first), the character of those appointed, and the use and service of such a ministry specially in guarding against evil, with all the absolute or external arrangements of the ministry and its dependencies, and the manner of using it.<a name=53:3></a> Its importance will be fully noticed by the service it is applied to, and its abuse at the present day.<a name=53:4></a> Its uniformity of character is given by adding the Epistle to Titus, and variety of use according to the circumstances in which it is placed.<a name=53:5></a> In Philemon we have the evidence of that minuteness of care, apostolic care, which recognises the ordering of an individual's concerns, and what would now be so multifariously despised -- the church in a house.<a name=53:6></a>

		The Epistle to the Hebrews is an instruction to the church, not an apostolic address to a church as such, of the way in which the types of the Old Testament were fulfilled in Christ, and how He was the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, answering to Moses and Aaron, but after another order; and how, consequently in this also (as with the saints of old) it was a dispensation of faith, and we must therefore go "forth without the camp," as well as be strangers in the world, while Christ is on high.<a name=53:7></a> I should feel gratified at some other occasion, to enter more in detail into the structure of this beautiful and instructive Epistle, but would not do it now.<a name=53:8></a> Thus we see how the church, being built and ordered by a wise master builder under Jesus, closed by this important testimony to the Hebrews, carrying forth the principle of faith to them and bringing in all the value of their ministrations to us in Jesus as that principle of faith.<a name=53:9></a>

		Peter's Epistles, or to speak more properly, the instruction of the Holy Ghost by him, gives us further light.<a name=54:1></a> They shew, though there is but one body in glory, the continuing care in ministration of the gracious and unchanging God over the Jews, the strangers scattered, for such are the persons addressed in the first Epistle, the <i>parepidemois diasporas</i> among the Gentiles, where they thought our Lord spoke of going and losing Himself.<a name=54:2></a> His great thesis is the resurrection, and leading the believing Jews in this to their right place in faith, and shewing the appearing again of Jesus to be the great time of bringing in the promises by it; that the remnant were the chosen people who had not stumbled at the stumbling-stone, but had, according to the word of the Lord testifying of His own resurrection in Psalm 34, "tasted that the Lord is gracious"; identifying Jesus and Jehovah the stone of stumbling, but of preservation, <i>Jehovah tsabaoth otho</i> but <i>l'miqdash</i> -- the Lord of Hosts Himself but for a sanctuary.<a name=54:3></a> The whole of the Epistle is addressed to the Jews, or rather to the two houses of Israel or their remnant, and pleads the resurrection and patience.<a name=54:4></a> The order and dispensation and the parenthetical character of this are very distinctly drawn in from verses 10-13 inclusive, of chapter 1.<a name=54:5></a> The second Epistle, though savouring of that character of ministry in all its motives and arguments, is general in its address "to them that have obtained like precious faith with us," more particularly however embracing Israel in the apostle's mind, as we may see in chapter 3: 1.<a name=54:6></a> It declares the judgment on apostasy, stating the adequacy of supply or the means of preservation in the memorial of the written word, founded on the faith of the seen and coming Jesus, and the instruments of that apostasy, false prophets and teachers, the character of it, and the remedy in that great subject which he had presented before them -- the coming of the Lord, which is here presented to the apostates in the character of judgment, "the day of the Lord.<a name=54:7></a>" And he exhorts them to diligence, that they may be found of Him coming, to be in that day without spot and blameless.<a name=54:8></a>

		In the deeply interesting Epistle of John we have the intrinsic evidences of the power of Christianity as flowing from God; its essential and internal abiding character; our strength in it, as giving fellowship with the Father and with His Son Christ Jesus; and hence in the knowledge of His love, or rather of love, by that which has brought us into this fellowship, security against the haughty assumption of antichristian seduction, in the assurance which flows from that fellowship, and is conscious that it is already in that which is falsely assumed to be presented, or which we may be charged with being without; while this, characteristically presented in its necessary fruits, guards against deception on the one side and the other.<a name=55:1></a> This is effected (first no declaring its source in chapter 1) by the two personal evidences, He laid down His life, "by his Spirit dwelling in us"; and external, as a guard against the assumption of others and the denial of our own righteousness, by keeping His commandments, and loving brethren.<a name=55:2></a> The unity of the testimony to Christ's glory, in the Spirit, the water, and the blood, is there stated; and the internal and external witness distinguished: one, the blessing of the believer; the other, the condemnation of the world; closing with the general contrast "we are of God, and the whole world lieth <i>en to ponero</i>.<a name=55:3></a>" "We know that the Son of God is come, and He hath given us an understanding": the next point is, "to know him that is true"; and the next, "we are in him that is true, even his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=55:4></a>" He is the "true God and eternal life.<a name=55:5></a>" Amen.<a name=55:6></a> All else is but "Little children, keep yourselves from idols.<a name=55:7></a>"

		How fitly the Revelation fills this up and closes this book, I need hardly say.<a name=56:10></a> The apostasy has been shewn previously to have come in, the tares sown among the wheat.<a name=56:11></a> This closed the care of apostolic ministry, and fitted in, as it were, to the great final apostasy.<a name=56:12></a> The Lord is therefore shewn at once judging in the midst of the churches; and in His own immortality of glory and holiness on His Father's throne, in the intermediate time, governing till He comes forth in His power, and ordering all things for His church; making "all things work together for good to them that love God, to them that are the called according to his purpose"; ending with the perfection of the blissful state, the heavenly Jerusalem come down, and the joy of the whole earth thus blessed in communion with it, sorrow gone from before the presence of God, where it never can abide, when He comes forth in power; and in power He does then come forth, and no evil remains before Him.<a name=56:13></a> Meanwhile the church is comforted with seeing the Lord cognisant of all the troubles and circumstances through which she is to pass, and is ready to join in the cry of the apostle with which he closes the book of God's testimony, "Even so, come Lord Jesus.<a name=56:14></a>" The first part of the book gives the care of the Lord; the second, the character of the apostasy, and of course how it resulted in judgment.<a name=56:15></a> Thus the dealing begins with judgment at the house of God, and ends with judgment on the ungodly and sinners -- two distinct classes; and then blessing from Him from whom the book, the testimony came.<a name=56:16></a> I do feel, in writing thus rapidly (I trust for the profit of the church), the extreme solemnity of the truths, thus by the mercy of our God brought before us, that we might enjoy the blessings which are their result.<a name=56:17></a> To Him whose it is be all the glory and praise; and may He keep us, adding of His grace in our ways, "that an abundant entrance may be ministered to us into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.<a name=56:18></a>"

		There are one or two remarks I would make in addition to this brief and hasty review of the bearings of the parts of this blessed book.<a name=57:1></a> I have given it because I believe it shews its perfectness and its adequacy, in answer to the lies and blasphemies which would denounce its imperfection; though, I am well assured, it will be understood and rested on by none who are not taught by the Spirit of God.<a name=57:2></a> I would remark then, first, the circumstance of the distinction between the epistles to individuals and to churches, "mercy" being always added in the address to individuals.<a name=57:3></a> The church is set in mercy, for it is looked at and known only as so addressed in the mercy of God.<a name=57:4></a> The individual is the daily subject of mercy to all his imperfectness and weakness, and is kept only by it.<a name=57:5></a>

		Further, it will be found that the title given to the churches, when churches are addressed, is accordant to the subject of the Epistle, and the aspect in which it presents the church.<a name=57:6></a> Thus, to the Thessalonians, it is the church "in God the Father," because it is addressed in the full liberty and hope of sons, as waiting for the glory, in the coming of the Son of God, of the Father's house as sons.<a name=57:7></a> The Ephesians and Colossians, "the saints and faithful in Christ Jesus," as rightly holding the Head, and united to Him in one body, and in the hope of the glory of Him the Head -- their Head; therefore in Christ Jesus especially, whence all their fulness flowed, as all fulness dwelt in Him.<a name=57:8></a> Nor are they therefore called the church, but viewed as saints, and faithful in that position or common connection with all the saints, as the Head of all, and parts of one body which should form the whole mystical man over all things, even as "all the fulness of the Godhead was in him bodily.<a name=57:9></a>" In Philippians, we find "Paul and Timotheus to all the saints in Christ Jesus, which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons"; the comprehensiveness of that general affection which we have shewn therein.<a name=57:10></a> In the reproving Epistle to the Galatians we have simply "the churches of Galatia.<a name=57:11></a>"

		In the Epistles to the Corinthians, when the order and conduct which became the church as a "church of God" is entered into at large, this is the title given to it; and I must remark here that the church is never called in Scripture the church of Christ.<a name=58:1></a> I am not questioning <i>ta ema panta sa, kai ta sa ema</i>, but the only passage in which it is at all so spoken of is "on this rock I will build My church," which is clearly outward profession and confession of the truth; and hence, though it may be in given times pure, the church of Christ is known by its profession of Christianity, that is, of the Person of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God.<a name=58:2></a> But this has nothing to do with the church of God.<a name=58:3></a> The church of God will be within that confession,<a href="#58:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> but the church of God is that for which the Lord Christ, the Lamb of God, gave Himself, purchased with His own blood, and shall be presented faultless in the presence of His glory.<a name=58:4></a> Now this may be encumbered with many outward circumstances, but judgment is applied to it as to the church of God; and hence the address I believe in the Corinthians: nor can spiritual judgment apply itself to any else, when the church is so mixed up as to render the separation of them impossible.<a name=58:5></a> Where there is not energy of the Spirit, and spiritual life to throw off the evil as a distinct thing, judgment is impossible; it cannot be addressed as being, nor is it at all, a church of God; it may come under the general designation as a part of the church of Christ, which is the subject of judgment in other sort, and excision in its external character; though the gates of Hades shall never prevail against it, as they did not against that on which it is founded, because the living resurrection Lord shall catch the children out of the judgment which He shall then exercise on him that has the power of death and his companions, into the glory that shall appear in Him and with Him, and their life shall be the rather in glory -- life indeed.<a name=58:6></a> Then it is the church lives indeed in resurrection, proving more abundantly than ever, that the gates of Hades shall not prevail against the children of the living God -- believers in Christ the Son of the living God.<a name=58:7></a> The opening of the Epistle to the Romans opens itself in the fullest manner, and indeed is a remarkable and beautiful illustration of that on which we are speaking; for every part and order of the dispensation is brought out, and fixed in its resulting and proper power, on those addressed in the opening part of this Epistle.<a name=58:8></a> The truth of Jewish, and power of Gentile or resurrection character, is addressed to, and finds its application in, all at Rome "called," etc.<a name=58:9></a> I have been, perhaps, too long on this, as I only throw it out as a hint.<a name=58:10></a>

		I will touch on some of the grounds they build their theory on; but I first turn to the book itself.<a name=65:1></a> First of all, it is treated as a whole by Christ and His apostles as having a well-known and specific character.<a name=65:2></a> "The scripture cannot be broken," John 10: 35.<a name=65:3></a> "Then opened he their understanding, that they should understand the scriptures," Luke 24: 45.<a name=65:4></a> "Search the scriptures," John 5: 39.<a name=65:5></a> They were a recognised collection which the Lord owned; and, yet more precisely, owned as we have them now and the Jews had them then.<a name=65:6></a> "All things must be fulfilled which are written in the Law of Moses, and in the Prophets and in the Psalms, concerning me.<a name=65:7></a>" Here is the Torah, Nebiim, and the Ketubim -- the three divisions which the Jews distinguish by the Gradus Mosaicus, Gradus Propheticus, and the Bath-Kol: in the two first, authorised by Numbers 12: 6-8; the latter human, in which their idea is that the writer, though inspired, expressed the sentiments animating his own mind, not knowing that all that was contained in it was the mind of the Holy Ghost; which is doubtless true often in such books as the Psalms.<a name=65:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ owned, then, what we call the Old Testament, and owned it as we and the Jews have it.<a name=65:9></a> But He goes farther; He owns them according to their present character and authors.<a name=65:10></a> "Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law?<a name=65:11></a>" (John 7: 19.<a name=65:12></a>) "Moses, therefore, gave you circumcision, not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers" (verse 22).<a name=65:13></a> There is one that accuseth you, even Moses in whom ye trust; for had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me; for he wrote of me.<a name=65:14></a> But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?<a name=65:15></a>" (John 5: 45-47).<a name=65:16></a> "If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken," chapter 10: 35.<a name=65:17></a> This alludes to the Judges being called Elohim in Hebrew; they shall bring him to the "judges" being very commonly Elohim, god or gods.<a name=65:18></a>" Abraham said unto him, They have Moses and the prophets, let them hear them.<a name=65:19></a> And he said, Nay, father Abraham; but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.<a name=65:20></a> And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded though one rose from the dead," Luke 16: 29-31.<a name=65:21></a> How true it has been with these poor Jews and these unhappy infidels!<a name=65:22></a> Christianity and the resurrection of the Lord are of no avail if Moses and the prophets are not believed, and believed in their writings, for surely they had them.<a name=65:23></a> "He wrote of me.<a name=65:24></a> If ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?<a name=65:25></a>"

		Remark further here that Septuagint translations, the "Compiler's" additions, and all that these speculators allege, were there then the same as now, the same collection, the collection as we have it; and Christ owned and insisted on the authority of that, and that as being Moses' writings.<a name=66:1></a>

		But further, after His resurrection, not even when dealing with Jews who owned them, but of and from Himself for His disciples, the risen Lord, "beginning at Moses and all the prophets, expounded to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself," Luke 24: 27.<a name=66:2></a> Think of the risen Christ expounding to His disciples a set of ill-compiled and contradictory old documents, pretended to be Moses and the prophets!<a name=66:3></a> But this is not all; they will say perhaps -- for what will the folly of learned infidelity not say?<a name=66:4></a> -- they were only the things concerning Himself which He selected.<a name=66:5></a> "These are the words which I spake unto you while I was with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses, and in the Prophets, and in the Psalms concerning me.<a name=66:6></a> Then opened he their understanding that they might understand the Scriptures, and said unto them, Thus it is written.<a name=66:7></a>" Ah!<a name=66:8></a> the written word is what He valued.<a name=66:9></a> Only just think of the risen Lord opening with divine power His disciples' understanding to understand a spurious compilation professing to be written by Moses and others!<a name=66:10></a> That He should do so that we might understand the divine word, we can well conceive, and, if taught of God, we know the need of it; but to do it for an imposition, pretending to be what it is not, an infidel speculator alone would believe.<a name=66:11></a> But the "unjust knoweth no shame.<a name=66:12></a>"

		Again, the Lord recognises the prophets as we have seen, and specifies the one most called in question, Daniel, "the abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel the prophet.<a name=66:13></a>" The reading is called in question in Mark, but not in Matthew, and the reading in Mark confirms the genuineness in Matthew, and further recognises the commandments as given by Moses to be spoken by God: for God commanded saying, Honour thy father and thy mother (Matthew 15: 4); and again Isaiah (verse 7), Well did Esaias prophesy concerning you, saying.<a name=66:14></a> This is in the first part.<a name=66:15></a> But He takes up also the second part of the "Great Unnamed.<a name=66:16></a>" There was delivered to Him the book of the prophet Esaias, and when He had opened the book He found the place where it was written (ah!<a name=66:17></a> that is the word), The Spirit of the Lord is upon me .<a name=66:18></a>.<a name=66:19></a>.<a name=66:20></a> .<a name=66:21></a> And He began to say, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.<a name=66:22></a> He was content to accept it as Isaiah, and affirms, what is of far more importance, and only really so, that it was of God Himself; Luke 4: 17-21.<a name=66:23></a> In the same chapter He authenticates the books of Kings and the history of Elijah and Elisha.<a name=66:24></a> He indirectly authenticates again the last part Or Isaiah (Luke 7: 27) in the prophecy of John Baptist; Isaiah 40: 3.<a name=66:25></a> I need hardly quote more passages.<a name=66:26></a>

		The discourses, life, and outgoings of the Lord's soul, though going necessarily far beyond it, and shewing it was to be set aside, as under the old covenant, for the accomplishment of far more glorious counsels, that the law and the prophets were until John, since then the kingdom of heaven was preached -- the whole discourses and life of Jesus, I repeat, if the Gospels be read in simplicity of heart will be found interwoven with the truth of the law and the prophets as they are presented to us in ordinary Bibles, authenticating them as they are, so that you must tear away all the revelation of Christ in them to remove the authority of the law and the prophets.<a name=67:1></a> He did not come to destroy, but to fulfil them.<a name=67:2></a> Fulfil what?<a name=67:3></a> A poor compilation of Ezra's time, or fragmentary documents made up by man, gradually grown up into a law unknown at the beginning?<a name=67:4></a> or the word of God given by inspiration to Moses and those whom Jehovah had sent?<a name=67:5></a> He was born in Bethlehem, because by God's will the prophet had said so.<a name=67:6></a> He dies, because if not, how then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be?<a name=67:7></a> Till heaven and earth passed, not one jot or one tittle would in anywise pass from the law till all be fulfilled.<a name=67:8></a>

		I may turn then to the servants of Christ when He had been rejected, the apostles and writers of the New Testament.<a name=67:9></a> The apostles, those authorised and sent by Him to announce Christian truth, and inspired by the Holy Ghost for this service, and the other inspired writers of the New Testament affirm, or which in a certain aspect is stronger, assume, everywhere that the Old Testament, as we and the Jews (enemies of Christianity, but in this witnesses with it) have it, is an inspired record, written by those to whom it is ascribed, and given of God.<a name=67:10></a> I can understand that the Baurs and Smiths (who, as rocks that, originating nothing, can only repeat a sound) echo them, thinking themselves more competent to tell us what Christianity and the truth is than Christ and His apostles.<a name=67:11></a> I have met such, men who did not scruple to say so, though checked somewhat by the scandal so speaking of Christ gave; I have met them in Europe and the United States; but all are not quite fit for that yet.<a name=67:12></a> Such thoughts are soon sunk in the deep sea of lifeless infidelity.<a name=67:13></a>

In the first place, they are not all of the passover, but some of unleavened bread, which, though connected, was a different feast, and the difference morally important; and in two cases specially connected with the consecration of the firstborn. As to the rest, we have the historical account in Exodus, and reference to it when the three great feasts are particularly directed to be kept. How these are divergent, my reader must find out; I cannot. It will be found that in Exodus 13 there is no special additional direction as to the firstborn and unleavened bread, and no law as to the passover at all. So in chapter 34: 18. Moreover, they are all Jehovistic; so that the Jehovistic and Elohistic documents, as of two definite authors, come to nothing. But the statement is ridiculous, a proof of the folly and levity of all that is alleged. See page 135.

		The first time we get <i>Most High</i> is when Melchisedek comes to meet Abraham.<a name=81:1></a> Not that God was not ever the Most High, but He had not taken it as a revealed name with His people on the earth.<a name=81:2></a> Here was a greater than Abraham, who blesses him after his full victory over his enemies.<a name=81:3></a> And God takes this title, not in connection with Abraham (which was El Shaddai, though he owns Him as such and as Jehovah too), but with the mysterious personage, figure clearly (according to Psalm 110, as developed also in the Hebrews) of Christ, King of righteousness, King of peace, now sitting on the right hand of the Father, on the Father's throne (Revelation 3: 21), not yet on His own, a priest after the similitude of Aaron now though not after his order, but who shall come forth at the sounding of the seventh trumpet, when Jehovah-Elohim-Shaddai shall take to Him His great power and reign; the Ancient of days who sits on His throne, but the Ancient of days who comes (Daniel 7), whom the King of kings and Lord of lords, the blessed and only Potentate, shall shew, but who is King of king and Lord of lords; when, after the last confederacy against Israel (Psalm 83), through the judgment of the confederate enemies, men shall know that He whose name alone is Jehovah is the Most High, Elion, in all the earth, as the punishment of the host of the high ones on high shall have shewn Him Most High there (Isaiah 24: 21), the Son of God and Son of man to whom all judgment is committed.<a name=81:4></a> So when the Gentile power, which God set up when He took His throne from Jerusalem, Nebuchadnezzar, comes to his senses, he writes, "I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up my eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom from generation to generation," Daniel 4: 34.<a name=81:5></a> I do not quote Daniel 7 for Most High, save verse 25, because the word is plural and means, I doubt not, "the high" or "heavenly places.<a name=81:6></a>" In verse 25, however, the beast speaks words against Elion bringing in judgment by them.<a name=81:7></a> But the kingdom of the Son of man is then set up.<a name=81:8></a> The little stone will have dashed the feet and toes of the image to pieces in judgment, and becomes then a great mountain which fills the whole earth; Daniel 2.<a name=81:9></a>

		Hence, in the scriptures of the Old Testament, Jehovah is the name regularly taken up by the writer, whose whole calling was by the revelation of it (Exodus 6), and by all the prophets of the nations whose God He was.<a name=83:1></a> But it was of all importance to them that He was that God who is the <i>ehyeh asher ehyeh</i>, "I am that I am," God ever existing, subsisting in Himself and creating all else.<a name=83:2></a> And this is one great truth of what I may call the translation of the name in the Apocalypse; not "who was, and is, and is to come," but "who is" (<i>o on), "who</i> was" the God known of old, the promiser withal, and who is the "coming one" <i>o erchomenos</i>, when He will be Ancient of days, and Most High, possessor of heaven and earth, and His name known (even that Jehovah, and Jehovah alone, is so) over all the earth.<a name=83:3></a>

		Many are the important lessons connected with this, but I cannot touch on them now.<a name=84:1></a> Jehovah, the God of Israel, was the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob.<a name=84:2></a> This was His name for ever, this His memorial for all generations; Exodus 3: 15.<a name=84:3></a> God as God, the Being who is, not a creature who begins <i>(esti</i>, not <i>ginetai)</i>, but exists in Himself -- the Almighty, who called the vessel of promise without condition, and Jehovah the God of Israel under whom the Jews took the promises under condition of obedience,<a href="#84:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> must be identified.<a name=84:4></a> Hence, while it was of all importance to keep God's essential name of God, and God self-existent contrasted with every creature, and to keep this essential character present before their minds, it was equally so to shew Jehovah was that God, not a mere country god as those of the heathen.<a name=84:5></a> This, and the difference of promise on condition, and unconditional, we shall find running through the Old Testament from the Pentateuch to Nehemiah;<a href="#84:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a> and the distinction is the basis of Paul's reasoning in the New Testament.<a name=84:6></a>

		We find then, when it was what God as God did or was, it is God, Elohim: where it is the account given by those who knew Jehovah, it is Jehovah; and when the solemnity of the name of God as such is to be added to God known in relationship, it is Jehovah Elohim; when in special bearing upon Israel, it is Jehovah thy God, or our God -- so constantly as a personal address in Deuteronomy.<a name=84:7></a> A spiritual-minded person will always feel the difference between the two.<a name=84:8></a> It may be the mere state of feeling sometimes expressed in it; sometimes it is of real importance when God's glory, as such, is concerned in it.<a name=84:9></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#84:f2"><sup>++</sup></a>Thus, in Exodus 32: 13, Moses appeals to God's promise without condition, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; Solomon, for the temple, and the blessing of Israel in connection with it, does not go beyond Moses and the Exodus (1 Kings 8), on which judgment was pronounced when the Lord cursed the fig-tree; and in fact this was all lost, and finally under that covenant. So in Leviticus 26, where Jehovah goes through all His judgments as governing the people to the end, He goes back, not only to Moses, but to the original unconditional promises to Jacob and Israel and Abraham. They will have the blessings of the promises under Moses, but through God's remembering His unconditional covenant, which comes first. Nehemiah refers only to Abraham as a covenant, though He speaks of their deliverance by means of Moses, for this was a deliverance by grace. We have only to read Ezra and Nehemiah to see the utter folly of Jehovistic and Elohistic accounts. I suppose Ezra and Nehemiah were not compiling their own history from Jehovistic and Elohistic fragments. The reader may also notice another title, "the God of heaven," as now no longer sitting between the cherubim, a distinction which will help him in understanding the book of Revelation also.

		An analogous difference is found in the New Testament.<a name=85:1></a> Not only is it said, Come out from the world, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith Jehovah Shaddai; but in Hebrews, where the question is how man can approach God, as such, we never find the Father -- it is always God; nor in the Revelation (save chapter 14, where His name is written on the foreheads of the special remnant there mentioned, but it is His Father).<a name=85:2></a> It is the throne of the government of the world which is in question, and it is Jehovah Elohim Shaddai, Lord God Almighty, as in chapters 4, 11 and 15.<a name=85:3></a>

		In John's writings, while as to what concerns the nature of God, the name God is used -- as "God so loved," "God is love," "God is light" -- and the same as regards our responsibility in respect of it, the moment the divine action in grace is spoken of, it is Father.<a name=85:4></a> Thus, chapter 4, God is a Spirit, and they that worship Him, must worship Him in spirit and in truth, "for the Father seeketh such to worship him.<a name=85:5></a>" This comes out in a striking way in the first four verses of 1 John 1, and in the rest of the chapter.<a name=85:6></a> So in chapter 1: 18 of the Gospel, and it will be found to run through all his writings.<a name=85:7></a> Suppose I were to say, Here is a Patristic and a Theistic document, and use "the scissors" to make the difference: it would prove nothing but alienation from God and moral incapacity.<a name=85:8></a> The principle is just the same.<a name=85:9></a>

		Thus not only have the Lord and the apostles owned the Old Testament as we possess it as God's inspired word, but it presents itself, as to the law as the direct fruit of Moses' communication with God, given fully and in detail originally, and the prophets, as the direct communication of God's mind and words from Himself; and all of it -- history, psalms, and all -- as an organic whole owned of the Lord Himself, and whose perfection, as such, will be perceived by those whose understandings He has opened, and who learn the whole scheme of God Himself.<a name=91:4></a>

		The result of all this and its general principle is already brought out in the garden of Eden; not a promise to the first man -- there is none, but the purpose of God when the first man had failed in responsibility.<a name=96:1></a> This responsibility he was put under, tempted by the adversary, and failed.<a name=96:2></a> The Lord God judged the woman for listening, but makes known the second Man, the Last Adam.<a name=96:3></a> He, the Seed of the woman, was to bruise the serpent's head, the serpent to bruise His heel -- the latter in the cross, the former when He comes in power.<a name=96:4></a> This is no promise to the first man, though his faith might lay hold of it, but a revelation of the Second.<a name=96:5></a> Adam assuredly was not the Seed of the woman.<a name=96:6></a> The history is referred to as unquestionable truth by Paul (1 Timothy 2: 9-15), as a ground for minute details as to woman; as a basis of the profoundest doctrine (Romans 5: 12-21), shewing sin to have been there by this means before the law, and when there was none; but referring to Hosea 6: 7,<a href="#96:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> shewing that Adam was under a law (not to eat of the tree of knowledge), but that from him to Moses man had none, confirmed as to the character of judgment (Romans 2: 12), those that have sinned <i>anomos</i>, without law, being distinguished from those who have sinned under it.<a name=96:7></a> So for watchfulness it is referred to in 2 Corinthians 11: 3.<a name=96:8></a> So the whole order and structure of God's plan in Christ, connected with ruin in the first Adam, is unfolded in 1 Corinthians 15, specially verses 20-28, and verses 45-49, and that in resurrection.<a name=96:9></a> The accomplishment in Jews, Gentiles, and the raised saints, is founded on Isaiah 25: 6-8.<a name=96:10></a>

		Thus not only historically Israel stood on the ground of the old covenant, but an immense principle was established and question raised, Is man's righteousness the ground of his standing before God, or is God's righteousness that on which a sinner can be accepted?<a name=97:1></a> But Israel also thus stood on a double ground -- promises made to Abraham, and righteousness under the law; and yet grace, unless God were the God of the Jews only, must reach out to the Gentiles, and this must be in Christ, and as taking His power as Head over all things, as we have seen, as Son of man.<a name=97:2></a> During the subsistence of the middle wall of partition, the blessing of the Gentiles was not shut out in hope, but left, as they were, in obscurity and darkness.<a name=97:3></a> When the world was idolatrous, the maintenance of the knowledge of one true God made this necessary, and so perverse is man, was with the utmost difficulty maintained.<a name=97:4></a> In the promises to Abraham it is as clearly as possible revealed in Genesis 12, and after Isaac's being offered up as a figure, and so received as raised from the dead, confirmed to the Seed.<a name=97:5></a> All nations were to be blessed in Him.<a name=97:6></a>

		But not only were the Gentiles left in darkness during the narrow period of testing man under law, and the promises confined in their actual application to a peculiar people, but life and incorruptibility were brought to light only under the gospel, and access to God allowed, The state under the law was marked by the veil, and the barriers which forbade it; now the holiest entered, God's righteousness being by faith for Gentile as well as Jew, and all the higher glories revealed in connection with resurrection, and a new state of man and a new creation, of which Christ risen and glorified is the firstfruits and head, "the second Man from heaven" <i>(o deuteros anthropos ex ouranou)</i>, and now gone back there as Man.<a name=99:9></a>

		The reader who is acquainted with Scripture will have seen that I have only made an abstract of its statements in all I have said, and put them together so that we may see that it is one complete plan of God, of which the moral principles and the historical development, though distinct subjects, cannot be separated.<a name=100:1></a> But let us see if we cannot, in some leading details, trace it through the scripture, shewing them more in detail, enchained by the plan of one mind.<a name=100:2></a> Indeed it begins before the world, of course then in the thoughts of God, but revealed to us, through mercy, not till the gospel came, not till the first man had been fully tried and tested in his responsibility.<a name=100:3></a> Thus we read (Proverbs 8), speaking of wisdom (and Christ is the wisdom of God and the power of God): "I was [before the creation, which is poetically described] daily his delight, rejoicing always before him, rejoicing in the habitable parts of his [Jehovah's] earth; and my delights were with the sons of men" -- here, in the nature and principle of His place, the Son of man.<a name=100:4></a>

		But to come to the citations of passages of scripture: in Psalm 2 after giving the character of the remnant in Psalm 1, we have the determination of Jehovah to set His King on the holy hill of Zion, the anointed Man, the Son of God as born in this world, who is further to ask for dominion over the heathen, whom He will rule with a rod of iron, and break in pieces like a potter's vessel.<a name=102:4></a> (Compare Revelation 2: 26, 27.<a name=102:5></a>) But for the present He is rejected.<a name=102:6></a> The kings of the earth and the rulers take counsel together against the Lord and against His anointed (Christ or Messiah).<a name=102:7></a> Adonai, sitting in the heavens, shall laugh at them.<a name=102:8></a> In Acts 4: 26, 27, the Holy Spirit expressly applies this to Christ's rejection and death.<a name=102:9></a>

		In Psalms 3-7 we have the consequent sorrows of the remnant, on which I do not enter.<a name=102:10></a> But in Psalm 8 Christ is celebrated in another character, when the Jews can celebrate Jehovah's name excellent in all the earth, and as having set His glory above the heavens, and as their Lord or Adon: a state of things not yet accomplished in fact, while the second verse is used by the Lord in the passage first quoted from Luke, as the testimony enforced, so to speak, by God, when the Saviour was here and rejected, quoting also Psalm 118, of which we may speak as specially referring to this future time of Christ's return in power.<a name=102:11></a> Now I quote this to shew that it is identified with man's being set over the works of God's hands.<a name=102:12></a> The Son of man, which the Lord constantly applies to Himself,<a href="#102:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> coming specifically into view, a passage as applied to Him in its full import as inheriting all God's purposes as to man; used as defining the whole position in the results of divine administration more than once by the apostle Paul, as (Ephesians 1: 22) "And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things to the church, which is his body" (compare Colossians 1: 15-18); and again, in 1 Corinthians 15: 20-28, when all things are to be put under the feet of the risen (the second) Man, except Him who put all things under Him.<a name=102:13></a> Here the whole scheme is unfolded; and again in Hebrews 2 we are told that we see not as yet all things put under Him; but we see Jesus made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour.<a name=102:14></a> Nothing can be more precise to both the divine purpose and the measure of its accomplishment, than these passages.<a name=102:15></a>

		The general fact is again brought before us, in quite another part of scripture, in contrast with the earthly power of evil in Daniel 7.<a name=103:1></a> The chapter is divided by the expression, "I saw in the night visions," verses 1-6, 7-12, to give the last beast (the principal one) more particularly, then 13, 14; from 15 to the end, inquiry and explanation, bringing in both the saints killed by the beast (and who, as is confirmed in Revelation 20 go into heaven) and Israel.<a name=103:2></a> I quote verse 13: "I saw in the night visions, and behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him," etc.<a name=103:3></a> This was when the thrones had been set for judgment.<a name=103:4></a> But afterwards we find it was the Ancient of days who came when judgment was given (verse 22) to the saints of the most high (the high places).<a name=103:5></a> So in Psalm 80, where Israel is crying out (not merely Jews) for their final deliverance, it is (verse 17): "Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the Son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself.<a name=103:6></a>" Thus the rejected Messiah, cut off, and who took nothing of the kingdom and glory, but cut off Himself, is the one who is the head over all things as Son of man according to the purpose of God.<a name=103:7></a>

		This truth runs through the Gospels where no passage perhaps is quoted.<a name=103:8></a> Nathanael owns Jesus to be the Christ according to Psalm 2: "Thou art the Son of God, the king of Israel.<a name=103:9></a>" "Thou shalt see greater things than these," says the Lord.<a name=103:10></a> "Henceforth thou shalt see the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man.<a name=103:11></a>" He takes His place as Son of man in contrast with and beyond that of Psalm 2.<a name=103:12></a> In John's Gospel the Jews are treated as rejected and reprobate from the first chapter (1: 10, 11), a remnant born again and believing, alone owned, because Jesus is God, and Him man never received, but was enmity against.<a name=103:13></a>

		The three other Gospels present Him as Messiah, Emmanuel, Jehovah, the Saviour (Matthew); the prophet-servant (Mark); and Son of man in grace after the first two chapters, a lovely picture of the remnant in Israel (Luke).<a name=103:14></a> Hence we have genealogy from Abraham and David in Matthew, up to Adam in Luke.<a name=103:15></a><a href="#103:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> When the Jews are utterly rejected at the end of Matthew 12, so that He no longer seeks fruit in His vineyard and fig-tree (verses 46-50), He goes out to sow, but He that sows the good seed is the Son of man; the kingdom in mystery, that is, without a present king (chapter 13), the church (chapter 16), the kingdom in glory (chapter 17), are substituted for Israel under the old covenant, but in chapter 16: 20 they are charged to tell no man that He was the Christ: The Son of man (chapter 17: 12) must suffer of them; more immediately contrasted, in Luke 9, which ends the chronological history (see verse 21) when Peter, taught of God, owns Him to be the Christ, "He straitly charged them and commanded them to tell no man that thing, saying, The Son of man must suffer .<a name=103:16></a>.<a name=103:17></a>.<a name=103:18></a> but be raised the third day"; and then He shews them the glory of the coming kingdom; the Son of man would come in His own glory, in the Father's, and of the holy angels, as Son of man, Son of the Father, and as Jehovah.<a name=103:19></a> But (Matthew 17: 9) this belonged to another scene, and man as a new creation.<a name=103:20></a> They were not to tell it till He was risen again from among the dead, and (Luke 9: 36) they kept it close, withal wondering what rising from among the dead should mean,<a href="#103:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a> (Mark 9: 10), and from that day began to press upon them that the Son of man must suffer; Matthew 16: 21; Mark 9: 31; Luke 9: 44.<a name=103:21></a> In John we have this under another form, namely that of a full testimony from God, when Israel had rejected Him, as Son of God, Son of David, and Son of man.<a name=103:22></a> The first is raising Lazarus; chapter 11: 4.<a name=103:23></a> "This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, and that the Son of God should be glorified thereby.<a name=103:24></a>"<a href="#103:f3"><sup class="footnote-link">+++</sup></a> He is the Resurrection and the Life.<a name=103:25></a> Then (chapter 12: 13), they meet Him, according to Psalm 118, crying, "Hosanna!<a name=103:26></a> [save now, I beseech thee] blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.<a name=103:27></a>" Then the Greeks <i>(Ellenes)</i> coming up, the wider scene of Gentiles, the Lord says: "The hour is come that the Son of man should be glorified.<a name=103:28></a> Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone; but, if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit"; and (verse 32), "I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.<a name=103:29></a>" So in His rejection, abjured by the High Priest, He owns He is the One spoken of in Psalm 2, the Christ, the Son of God, but adds: "Nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of heaven.<a name=103:30></a>" Thus that which dispensationally set aside the Jews under the old covenant, and ended their title under the promises, brought out the far deeper truths of the enmity of man's heart against God in goodness -- "They have both seen and hated both me and my Father" -- but the accomplishment of that glorious work in which salvation was provided for Gentile as well as Jew, and God perfectly glorified in all that He is; the Christ rejected, Messiah cut off, as Daniel declared; and that as Son of man, not now taking the glory, but as suffering, yet vindicated of God as such; the whole truth of Psalms 2 and 8, Adam the image of Him that was to come (Daniel 9, 7) brought into light and accomplishment, and this not in quoted passages, but in realising facts, and then, when the Holy Ghost was given, the passages applied and explained, as in Acts 4 and Ephesians 1, 1 Corinthians 15, Hebrews 2, with no appearance of putting together or arrangement by those who uttered these things, but shewing one mind and thought and plan behind it all, the word and counsel of God.<a name=103:31></a> I might multiply passages as to the use of Son of man, but I have only quoted what brought the bearing of Psalms 2 and 8 together.<a name=103:32></a> But the death of Christ closed the earthly history of Scripture, till the Son of man shall come in His glory.<a name=103:33></a> Hence Stephen, summing up that history from Abraham, when the promises began, shews the law broken, the prophets killed, the Just One betrayed and murdered, and the Holy Ghost resisted; and then sees the Son of man standing at the right hand of God.<a name=103:34></a> He had taken His heavenly place, though not yet set down.<a name=103:35></a> Now He sits at God's<a href="#103:f4"><sup class="footnote-link">++++</sup></a> right hand till His enemies are made His footstool, having by one offering perfected for ever <i>(eis to dienekes)</i> them that are sanctified.<a name=103:36></a> It was the time of the church, His body, and the habitation of God through the Spirit.<a name=103:37></a> Hence the Son of man is no longer spoken of, save as giving Him His place on high; Hebrews 2: 6.<a name=103:38></a> But as soon as I come to the Revelation, what Christ had declared before the high priest, partly as seen by Stephen and taught in Hebrews 2, the accomplishment of Psalm 110 is, as to the latter part, brought out prophetically in Revelation 14, coming as Judge for the ripe harvest of earth and the vintage of God's wrath (verses 14-20).<a name=103:39></a> We find Him judging the church as responsible on earth in chapter 1.<a name=103:40></a> But from Acts 7 to Revelation He is never spoken of as Son of man, save that Psalm 8 itself is quoted (Hebrews 2), to shew where we are in this history.<a name=103:41></a> Even then He is not called so.<a name=103:42></a>

		I may briefly refer to some other points where this unity of mind is developed -- the three great feasts of Israel, ordinances which pointed to the great principles and power of the gatherings of God's people.<a name=106:1></a> There were other feasts: the Sabbath, a sign of the covenant made with them, but also that His people are in due time to enter into God's rest (here that of the first creation, for us of the new creation, as risen); the new moon -- a sign, I doubt not, of the restoration of Israel; as the tenth day of the seventh month was of their future mourning, and entering into the delivering power of the atonement; but on these I do not enter here.<a name=106:2></a> At the three other feasts, Passover (with unleavened bread), Pentecost, and Tabernacles, all Israel was to go up to the place where God had put His name.<a name=106:3></a> Full of interest as they are in themselves, I must now confine myself to them, as forming a chain of unity in the history.<a name=106:4></a>

		But, then, there was another thing in this feast, an eighth day, a specially solemn day; it reached beyond the seven full days of this world's week to the first day of another which began afresh.<a name=109:1></a> On that day, "that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink.<a name=109:2></a> He that believeth on me (as the scripture said), Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.<a name=109:3></a> But this spake he of the Spirit which they that believe on him should receive, for the Spirit was not yet [given] because Jesus was not yet glorified," John 7.<a name=109:4></a> He could not associate Himself with Israel at this feast, but He could tell them on that special day, which went beyond the order of this world, that the Holy Ghost would be given consequent on His taking a heavenly and glorious place as Man, with which that Holy Spirit associates us.<a name=109:5></a> With the rest of Israel on earth comes in, what is yet a hope for us too, association with Christ in heavenly glory, as shewn in its manifestation in the kingdom on the mount of Transfiguration, of which the Holy Ghost is given to us as earnest while Christ is entered as a forerunner, expecting till His enemies shall be made His footstool.<a name=109:6></a> Then He shall have all things gathered together in one in heaven and on earth; and then shall be fulfilled in Israel, and far better for us, the declaration of Deuteronomy 16: 14, "And thou shalt rejoice .<a name=109:7></a>.<a name=109:8></a>.<a name=109:9></a> because Jehovah thy God shall bless thee in all thine increase, and in all the work of thine hands; therefore thou shalt surely rejoice.<a name=109:10></a>" It was a feast hardly kept, and no wonder, in all their history; in Solomon's dedication, lost in the general joy, so to speak, and observed in Nehemiah's time (chapter 8: 14), when they had learnt, though sore smitten, to sing again David's song, "His mercy endureth for ever.<a name=109:11></a>" Is all this without a purpose or an order, in Leviticus, Deuteronomy, and in the Lord's remarkable conduct and words in John?<a name=109:12></a> while all the testimonies of the Lord's judgments, and of the rest of heart, far too numerous to quote here, confirm the truth of it, and lead, as it will, to the full singing of that lovely word so repeated in the end of the Psalms, <i>l'olam chesedo</i>, "His mercy endureth for ever": while we have better things in glory with Him where He is gone; yet all things to be gathered into one under Him "for the administration of the fulness of time," Ephesians 1: 10.<a name=109:13></a>

		If we turn to the SACRIFICES we find the same neglect of God, as in everything; but the full intention and unity of intention is evident, indeed plainly stated.<a name=111:14></a> We find it, from Abel onward, the only legitimate ground of access to God.<a name=111:15></a> "Without shedding of blood is no remission.<a name=111:16></a>" "It is the blood that maketh atonement for the soul.<a name=111:17></a>" Sacrifices were offered to God, but for men; worship was connected with an altar, a deep and important principle notified to us in Cain and Abel, and in the patriarchs; nor in the tabernacle service could any strange fire be used to burn the incense, the neglect of which cost Nadab and Abihu their lives, and closed the entry of the holiest to Aaron save on the great day of atonement.<a name=111:18></a> Sin and death had come in; and death and the acknowledgment of sin must come in for man to approach God; and when all was ordered of God, a clean and spotless victim must be offered.<a name=111:19></a> Such offerings occur, and mark the career of the godly (the Abrahams, whose earthly life was a tent, his divine life an altar),<a href="#111:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> and repeated too often to call for any individual notice.<a name=111:20></a> When all was ordained in connection with the tabernacle, and detail entered into, there was the burnt-offering which was on the ground of sin being there and atonement made (though not for particular transgressions), but was all burnt to God, an absolute sweet savour; the meat-offering, in which was no leaven (figure of sin), but all kneaded with oil and anointed with oil, and that in each minutest part; much frankincense, but all burnt to God, fully tested by holy judgment and only sweet savour.<a name=111:21></a> Then others feasted on what was slain as did the offerer, priest, the priests, and God too, while the same abiding law held good as to the blood and fat; and lastly, when there had been actual sins, there were offerings for them confessed on the victim's head; and if the blood was carried into the sanctuary, the body burnt without the camp.<a name=111:22></a> If the efficacy of the atoning blood went into heaven, the victim was rejected outside the camp, an earthly religion (connection of a people with God upon earth) ceased and was impossible.<a name=111:23></a> And especially on the great day of atonement the blood was carried into the holiest of all -- God's own presence, according to what He was, not merely man's responsibility met by what was done on the altar of burnt-offering without.<a name=111:24></a> Besides this there was a sacrifice connected with their journey through the wilderness, for any uncleanness contracted there, unfitting any, otherwise entitled, to go up to the worship of God.<a name=111:25></a> This last was carried out, not by the shedding or sprinkling blood again, but by sprinkling with living water, into which the ashes of the burnt heifer had been put.<a name=111:26></a> The blood had been sprinkled seven times where God met the people.<a name=111:27></a>

		The same divine thought runs through Scripture from the beginning of Genesis to the end of Revelation; the divine thought, prefigured in Abel, in the Exodus, and the sacrifices of the tabernacle, sung in holy strains in the Psalms, prophesied of by the prophets of God, even to the price He was to be sold for, accomplished in the Word made flesh, and unfolded in the instructions of the Holy Ghost -- God's precious Lamb, whose blood cleanses us from all sin.<a name=114:1></a> Was it a compiler of fragmentary documents in Ezra's time, or God, who has taught us all this, one immense moral truth from Abel to the consummation of all things, the foundation of the stability of the new heavens and the new earth which makes grace righteousness -- the righteousness of God, and sets man at His right hand in glory, opening heaven to us now, and in time taking us there?<a name=114:2></a> It was God's thought, God's work of love, and God's revelation, never lost sight of, as it never will be when even the kingdom shall be given up that God may be all and all.<a name=114:3></a>

		These may suffice as illustrations of how divine thought runs as a continued stream of purpose through the Bible as a whole.<a name=114:4></a> I insist upon its being many books, by many authors, collected no man knows by whom (not the "learned Germans" more than I or Mr.<a name=114:5></a> Smith), but proved to be divinely inspired, individually and collectively, by the divine oneness which pervades their contents, and the more from their being many authors in remote ages.<a name=114:6></a> But I will now take two special parts of the great collection; for collection, whoever made it, everyone admits it is, the Lord Himself setting His seal of acceptance on it as such -- I mean the Gospels and Psalms -- to shew the divine mind in each.<a name=114:7></a>

		I turn to Luke, but only for some brief remarks, with a view to my special object.<a name=119:4></a> It begins with a lovely picture of the godly remnant in Judah, and the prophetic Spirit amongst them, hidden in the midst of the abounding iniquity of Israel; but where, as in the cave of Adullam, a godly priest, the true king, and the Spirit of prophecy are found.<a name=119:5></a> But the Jews are under the power of the Roman "beast," and events are dated by his reign.<a name=119:6></a> Then comes a genealogy,<a href="#119:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> which traces Christ up to Adam.<a name=119:7></a> He is Son of man come in grace, not the heir of promises to Abraham and David.<a name=119:8></a> At once, in chapter 4, He shews God's goodness extended to the Gentiles, so that they were going to kill Him.<a name=119:9></a> Then we have His power over demons and diseases, cleansing the leper and forgiving sins on earth; He is come to the sick.<a name=119:10></a> His disciples could not fast then -- the bridegroom was there; -- nor could new wine be put into old bottles, the truths of grace and the gift of the Spirit into Jewish ordinances.<a name=119:11></a> He is found (as constantly in Luke) praying as Son of man, and slighting their thoughts of the Sabbath; He was Lord of it as Son of man; it was the sign of the covenant with Israel; Ezekiel 20.<a name=119:12></a> He gives then the summary of blessings and woes (the disciples are "ye poor"), but not the principles on which they would enter into the kingdom.<a name=119:13></a> There is more faith in a Gentile than in Israel, and then He raises the dead.<a name=119:14></a> The poor multitude and publicans justified God; the Pharisees rejected His counsel and are rejected.<a name=119:15></a> But wisdom is justified of all her children; and the child of wisdom is shewn in the poor woman, a sinner in the city; not in the Pharisee who, with God in the house, decided, as rationalists do, that He, most clearly, could not be a prophet.<a name=119:16></a> But forgiveness, salvation, and peace are the portion of the poor woman, to whose heart and conscience God had revealed Himself in Christ as light and love.<a name=119:17></a>

The Talmudists make Mary the daughter of Heli to be tormented in the other world. The vision of Isaiah (A.D. 68), it is said, makes Mary to be of the lineage of David. So does Tertullian according to Kaye. But this only by the bye.

		I would now mention a principle of order which helps us to understand the connection of many Psalms.<a name=127:20></a> One or more psalms give the platform on which the thoughts and feelings of the following Psalms are based.<a name=127:21></a><a href="#127:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> But, first, as to the character of the five books.<a name=127:22></a> In the first the remnant is still in Jerusalem, and the name Jehovah is used throughout, though in two Elohim be introduced.<a name=127:23></a> And here we have more prophetic reference to Christ, though rejected.<a name=127:24></a>

		In the second book the remnant is out of Jerusalem; but their state is pursued through rejection till the authority of the Son of David be established.<a name=128:1></a> This begins with Elohim; but after Psalm 45, when the King is brought in in power, we find Jehovah, and triumph.<a name=128:2></a> Blood-guiltiness is owned, the sufferings and sorrows of the people under oppression and hostile power are recounted: and Elohim is largely, sometimes exclusively, used in contrast with man powerful in wickedness.<a name=128:3></a> Still judgment is looked for in faith, and true repentance in Israel.<a name=128:4></a> But the remnant all through are cast out, though their praise is ready (Psalm 65) when restored.<a name=128:5></a> In Psalm 69 Christ associates Himself with Israel, bearing their sins, and carrying their sorrows in His heart, though rejected of them; and here Jehovah comes in again.<a name=128:6></a> It closes, as already said, in the Son of David being established in glory and power.<a name=128:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The third book goes beyond the Jews, and takes in all Israel.<a name=128:8></a> They are to be received after the glory, and though faith does bring in Jehovah at Psalms 73: 28; 78: 21; 80: 4; 81: 10, still Elohim is the constant cry: they are not yet restored by the glory.<a name=128:9></a> Still we have this prophetically, and all the exercises of heart and faith and hope about it furnished to them by inspiration.<a name=128:10></a> Here too the old associations of Israel as a whole are far more fully before us.<a name=128:11></a> In chapter 83 Jehovah comes fully in again, on the judgment against the last confederacy being executed, and is used even in the depth of their humiliation (Psalm 88), their guilt under the old covenant.<a name=128:12></a> In the next Psalm mercies are recounted and Christ brought in (verse 19 called "holy one" wrongly.<a name=128:13></a> It is still <i>Chesed, so</i> the same as in the first verse generally; in verse 18 <i>Kodesh)</i>, that is Jehovah.<a name=128:14></a> This closes the book.<a name=128:15></a>

		The fifth book, from Psalm 107 to the end, is more general, but we have them gathered out of all lands; the great revelation that Messiah Melchisedec was to sit on Jehovah's right hand till His enemies were made His footstool: then His power would come out of Zion.<a name=129:1></a> It is fully celebrated that "Jehovah's mercy endureth for ever.<a name=129:2></a>" The circumstances of deliverance are rehearsed in the Mahaloth, the law written (Psalm 119) in the heart of Israel who had gone astray like a sheep that was lost: and finally the great Hallelujah of now accomplished deliverance.<a name=129:3></a> Psalms 72 and 145 alone, as far as I remember, describe the millennial state itself: the first as to Christ; the second as to His association with the people.<a name=129:4></a> Psalm 118 is the full description of the return of Israel's heart to Jehovah, recognising His ways and their own fault, and is constantly quoted by the Lord in the Gospels, and brought out by the power of God in the last entry in Jerusalem; and it is quoted also in the Acts.<a name=129:5></a>

		I return to note a few details based on the principle referred to at the outset.<a name=129:6></a> Psalms 1, 2, are the preface and key as I have said; then Psalms 3-7 the thoughts and feelings Christ's rejection has given rise to in the remnant, ending in His character as Son of man; Psalm 8.<a name=129:7></a> Of this I have spoken before.<a name=129:8></a> Psalms 9, 10<a href="#129:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> are the sorrows of the Jews and the delivering judgments of God; in Psalms 11-17 their thoughts and feelings, Christ's resurrection, trust and righteousness being introduced, ending in Psalm 18, when Christ's sufferings are made the key to Israel's history, from Egypt to the establishment of the kingdom in power.<a name=129:9></a> Psalms 19-22 are deeply interesting, creation testimony, the testimony of the law, of a Christ suffering, from Man exalted to glory and punishing all His enemies, of a Christ suffering indeed from man but then crying to God and forsaken, yet perfect and making atonement; nothing but wider and wider blessing flowing from it to the remnant which becomes the church, literally accomplished in John 20, to all Israel, to the world, and those born in the millennium: "He hath done this.<a name=129:10></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		I need not go any farther to illustrate general principles, which is all I can attempt to do now.<a name=130:4></a> The divine sequence and connection of the Psalms is, I think, evident; yet they are confessedly isolated songs, composed at different times, even if mostly David's: a collection, but the mind of God shines through them as a collection; His purposes in Christ and in Israel, when Jehovah shall be owned as Most High in all the earth, a suffering remnant and a Messiah who has entered into their sorrows.<a name=130:5></a> Of course the Father's name is not and cannot be found in them, nor the Spirit of adoption.<a name=130:6></a> It is deeply interesting to see that, while His human sorrows can be viewed in Psalm 20, His atoning sufferings can be expressed only by His own mouth; Psalm 22.<a name=130:7></a>

		I would say a few words on Petrine and Pauline teaching, as it is greatly dwelt on by these "learned Germans.<a name=130:8></a>" It is folly, as they take it with their speculations, but most interesting, when rightly looked at.<a name=130:9></a> That the Jews had the strongest prejudices against the Gentiles is notorious, and that the Jewish Christians were not exempt from them is evident upon the face of the New Testament history.<a name=130:10></a> We possess in the Acts of the Apostles the case of Cornelius, and it is plainly in point both as regards Peter himself and those at Jerusalem.<a name=130:11></a> The affair between him and Paul (Galatians 2) tells the same tale, and reveals, as do other passages, the effort to force circumcision on the Gentiles.<a name=130:12></a> The council in Acts 15 under God decided otherwise at Jerusalem itself, which was the important point.<a name=130:13></a> But, clear as may have been the Christian decision, prejudices remain behind decisions acquiesced in.<a name=130:14></a> "Certain came from James" marks this clearly.<a name=130:15></a> Only in Hebrews 13: 10-13 are they summoned to give up Judaism.<a name=130:16></a>

		But there was much more than this.<a name=131:1></a> The writings of Paul contain a doctrine unknown to all other parts of scripture -- the church as the body of Christ.<a name=131:2></a> It is not mentioned by any other New Testament writer.<a name=131:3></a> The word is not used.<a name=131:4></a> It was a dispensation committed to him, besides the gospel, to complete the word of God.<a name=131:5></a> He was the wise master-builder who laid the foundation.<a name=131:6></a> It had been hidden from ages and generations: in proof of this, see Romans 16: 25 (read "prophetic scriptures," not "scriptures of the prophets"); Ephesians 3: 1-10; Colossians 1: 24-26.<a name=131:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		John had nothing to do with this question: his ministry did not reach out to it.<a name=131:8></a> It was the revelation of eternal life, and the Father in the Son, and His becoming our life; but his ministry is always individual.<a name=131:9></a> If the children were to be gathered together in one by Christ's death, as well as the nation died for, it is individually as a family, not as the body of Christ.<a name=131:10></a> And in the mysterious end of his Gospel it passes from Peter, closes his life and ministry as Christ did, and passes on to Christ's coming: in ministry fulfilled in the Apocalypse.<a name=131:11></a> In this last chapter of John, Paul does not come in at all.<a name=131:12></a> John speaks of Christ's and our going to heaven but four times, as far as I remember.<a name=131:13></a> (Chapters 6, 14, 16, and 17.<a name=131:14></a>) His ministry was the display of what was divine here below: hence its attractiveness.<a name=131:15></a>

		Paul presents us in Christ before God: and this leads to union with Christ as His body.<a name=131:16></a> Peter's ministry, after presenting grace, redemption, and birth by the incorruptible seed of the word, and speaking of Christ's bearing our sins, very clearly dwells as his speciality on the government of God: in the first Epistle as to the saints; in the second as to the ungodly.<a name=131:17></a> I speak in all these cases of what characterises them.<a name=131:18></a> But none ever touches on what constitutes Paul's special ministry.<a name=131:19></a> I may add, John still speaks of preachers who had gone out taking nothing of the Gentiles, of Christ dying, not for our sins only, but for the whole world.<a name=131:20></a> He puts our standing clearly in Christ (1 John 4: 17); but it is still individual.<a name=131:21></a>

		The Platonism of John is a fable; it is anti-Platonic in its revelations, and expressly so.<a name=132:1></a> The notion even of disputes after the destruction of Jerusalem seems to me unhistorical -- save some Nazarenes and Ebionites in Palestine, soon sunk into insignificance.<a name=132:2></a> Judaism proper sank into oblivion.<a name=132:3></a> The Alexandrian corruption of Christianity issuing in Arianism was later and connected with Neoplatonism.<a name=132:4></a> Justin Martyr (A.<a name=132:5></a>D.<a name=132:6></a> 140) was infected with it, and others of that school in his time.<a name=132:7></a> But it was another thing.<a name=132:8></a> This is true that the full doctrine of redemption as taught by Paul never took root in the church: the church itself Judaised, and has remained in this state to this day.<a name=132:9></a> The return to Paul's teaching, and partially John's, is what is disturbing its slumbers at this day.<a name=132:10></a>

		What was special in Paul's doctrine was that by the descent of the Holy Ghost believers, perfectly saved, were united in one body to Christ, Jews or Gentiles: and the fulness of redemption in a new creation was manifested, by the glorifying of Christ, as man, on high.<a name=132:11></a> Paul's conversion connected itself with this.<a name=132:12></a> He never knew Christ on earth -- was a strict legal Jew.<a name=132:13></a> Christ was revealed to him in glory, and Christians spoken of by Christ as being Himself.<a name=132:14></a> He was delivered from the people and from the Gentiles, and sent to these last in connection with a glorified Christ, all disciples being one with Him: and the apostles at Jerusalem give up to him their mission to the Gentiles; Galatians 2.<a name=132:15></a> Of course this gave a special character to his mission, though the gospel, the basis of personal salvation, remained the same.<a name=132:16></a> It was a dispensation committed to him, a mystery kept secret since the world began.<a name=132:17></a>

		In order to shew the advantage of reading the foregoing along with the article on which it animadverts, we give a quotation from it on alleged "Parallel Narratives" and divergent laws, in the Pentateuch: --
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"This view is supported by the fact that, even as it now stands the history sometimes gives more than one account of the same event, and that the Pentateuch often gives several laws on the same subject.<a name=135:3></a> Of the latter we have already had one example, but for our present argument the main point is not diversity of enactment, which may often be only apparent, but the existence within the Pentateuch of distinct groups of laws partly taking up the same topics.<a name=135:4></a> Thus the legislation of Exodus 20-23 is partly repeated in chapter 34, and on the passover and feast of unleavened bread we have at least six laws, which, if not really discordant, are at least so divergent in form and conception that they cannot be all from the same pen (Exodus 12: 1-28; chapter 13: 3-10; chapter 23: 15; chapter 34: 18; Leviticus 23: 5-14; Deuteronomy 16.<a name=135:5></a>) Of historical duplicates the most celebrated are the twofold history of the creation and the flood, to which we must recur presently.<a name=135:6></a> The same kind of thing is found in the later books; for example, in the account of the way in which Saul became king, where it is scarcely possible to avoid the conclusion that 1 Samuel 11: 11 should attach directly to chapter 10: 16 (cf.<a name=135:7></a> chapter 10: 7).<a name=135:8></a>
	</div>

		"The extent to which the historical books are made up of parallel narratives, which, though they cover the same period, do not necessarily record the same events, was first clearly seen after Astruc (1753 A.<a name=135:9></a>D.<a name=135:10></a>) observed that the respective uses of Jehovah (LORD) and Elohim (God) as the name of a deity afford a criterion by which two documents can be dissected out of the book of Genesis.<a name=135:11></a> That the way in which the two names are used can only be due to difference of authorship is now generally admitted, for the alternation corresponds with such important duplicates as the two accounts of creation, and is regularly accompanied through a great part of the book by unmistakable peculiarities of language and thought, so that it is still possible to reconstruct at least the Elohim document with a completeness which makes its original independence and homogeneity matter of direct observation.<a name=135:12></a> The character of this narrative is annalistic, and where other materials fail, blanks are supplied by genealogical lists.<a name=135:13></a> Great weight is laid on orderly development, and the name Jehovah is avoided in the history of the patriarchs in order to give proper contrast to the Mosaic period (cf.<a name=135:14></a> Genesis 17: 1; Exodus 6: 3) and, accordingly, we find that the unmistakable secondary marks of this author run through the whole Pentateuch and Joshua, though the exclusive use of Elohim ceases at Exodus 6.<a name=135:15></a> Of course the disappearance of this criterion makes it less easy to carry on an exact reconstruction of the later parts of the document; but on many points there can be no uncertainty, and it is clearly made out that the author has strong priestly tendencies, and devotes a very large proportion of his space to liturgical matters.<a name=135:16></a> The separation of this document may justly be called the point of departure of positive criticism of the sources of the Old Testament; and present controversy turns mainly on its relation to other parts of the Pentateuch.<a name=135:17></a> Of these the most important are: 1.<a name=135:18></a> The Jehovistic narrative, which also begins with the creation, and treats the early history more in the spirit of prophetic theology and idealism, containing, for example, the narrative of the fall, and the parts of the history of Abraham which are most important for Old Testament theology.<a name=135:19></a> That this narrative is not a mere supplement to the other, but an independent whole, appears most plainly in the story of the flood, where two distinct accounts have certainly been interwoven by a third hand.<a name=135:20></a> 2.<a name=135:21></a> Many of the finest stories in Genesis, especially great part of the history of Joseph, agree with the Elohim-document in the name of God, but are widely divergent in other respects.<a name=135:22></a> Since the researches of Hupfeld, a third author, belonging to northern Israel, and specially interested in the ancestors of the northern tribes, is generally postulated for these sections.<a name=135:23></a> His literary individuality is in truth sharply marked, though the limits of his contributions to the Pentateuch are obscure.<a name=135:24></a>" -- Ed.<a name=135:25></a> B.<a name=135:26></a> W.<a name=135:27></a> and R.<a name=135:28></a>

		But this is not really the question.<a name=139:1></a> They all develop a system which destroys the authority of the word of God, which denies it comes from Him to us.<a name=139:2></a> This is attempted to be denied, and covered up, and softened down, not to frighten honest minds, not to say Christian ones, too soon.<a name=139:3></a> But this is only Satan's craft, and if those who talk of literary inquiries into the history of the sacred writings believe really that we have God's revelation, they must know that this system undermines it, that it denies that we have God's revelation on God's authority.<a name=139:4></a> I shall proceed to shew this.<a name=139:5></a>

		There are two systems in the main, if you take thoroughgoing destructives as Graf and others (De Wette grew somewhat more sober); that Deuteronomy was the first book written, and in Josiah's time, or a little before, but produced then by the high priest; and that the legal enactments of the Pentateuch were added after the Babylonish captivity, Moses' name being used to secure the priestly influence established in them.<a name=139:6></a> I suppose this is not inspiration.<a name=139:7></a>

		According to Ewald, the great body of these laws were drawn up by a priest very soon after the building of the temple by Solomon.<a name=139:8></a> This is the "Book of Origins.<a name=139:9></a>" He admired greatly the character of the writing, which is the production of a great and elevated genius aroused by the reigns of David and Solomon.<a name=139:10></a> This too was to enforce the priests' rights and authority.<a name=139:11></a> This history includes the creation, to which, being of an elevated mind, he could look back, and went on to the history of the Judges' time, but this is lost, and was very briefly related; for he tells us what parts of it are clearly lost.<a name=139:12></a> But he holds there was before this a book of covenants which recorded various covenants of Abraham and Abimelech, and Isaac and Jacob, etc.<a name=139:13></a>, and Exodus 20 to 23.<a name=139:14></a> This was written about Samson's time.<a name=139:15></a> Even before this there were written documents, as songs, and the book of the wars of the Lord, and that of Jasher.<a name=139:16></a> After the Book of Origins, the great work of Solomon's time, there were in his earlier editions a third and fourth, in the last, a third, fourth, and fifth writer, to complete the recovery and collection of the old traditions, adding and connecting and modifying, and, besides this, one who put all together and added some passages to make a rounded whole of it.<a name=139:17></a>

		But I shall begin nearer home with the sermon of Dr.<a name=140:7></a> Marcus Dods and his excusing preface.<a name=140:8></a> Dr.<a name=140:9></a> Dods goes so far as to admit that, when the prophets say "Thus saith the Lord," a revelation has been made to them.<a name=140:10></a> Would he allow me to ask him, Has none been made to us, when the prophets say "Thus saith the Lord?<a name=140:11></a>" This you will not find from Dr.<a name=140:12></a> Dods.<a name=140:13></a> Happily, if we do not find it from him, we can from such words find it out without him.<a name=140:14></a> But the whole point lies there; is there a revelation to us?<a name=140:15></a> How God revealed the truth to the prophet is not, as he would have us believe, in question at all.<a name=140:16></a> No one can tell how, save as, in some cases, told us in Scripture; Numbers 12: 6, 8.<a name=140:17></a> But how the word of the Lord came to them, those to whom it has not thus come are not likely to know.<a name=140:18></a> Nor do I believe a prophet could explain it to one who had not experienced it.<a name=140:19></a> The question is: Is it the word of God for me as given out by the prophet?<a name=140:20></a> Well, if "Thus saith the Lord" be true, it clearly is; though Dr.<a name=140:21></a> Dods will not say so.<a name=140:22></a> "Similarly of the apostles," adds Dr.<a name=140:23></a> Dods, "I, of course, believe they are the authoritative teachers of the church, and that, in order to fit them to be so, special revelations were made to them.<a name=140:24></a>" Is what they have written the word of God to us?<a name=140:25></a> This is the question.<a name=140:26></a> Paul tells us very distinctly how the matter stood.<a name=140:27></a> God has given to "us not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God; that we might know the things which are freely given to us of God; which things also we speak not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth.<a name=140:28></a>" And he adds the third step too.<a name=140:29></a> "The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit: but they are foolishness unto him, because they are spiritually discerned.<a name=140:30></a>"<a href="#140:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> We may compare the words of the Lord in the special case of their answering before magistrates: "Take no thought of how or what ye shall speak, for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak.<a name=140:31></a> For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.<a name=140:32></a>" The theory of these doctors is that the gracious Lord would put words in the mouth of His servants for their difficulties: but in what was to be truth for the church at all times, the basis of its faith and its security against error, direct communication (I do not say revelation) to us of the truth was not so made by those to whom He made the revelation of it for that purpose.<a name=140:33></a>

	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#140:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>And note here, there is a difference between revelation and inspiration, a point for many reasons I should insist on.

		Dr.<a name=141:1></a> Dods does not deny that in the case of the prophets man had revelation made to them; but he does carefully distinguish between this and the inspiration of the Scriptures, and he distinctly denies that any revelation is made by them to us.<a name=141:2></a> Now, in the case of the prophets, the matter is palpable, and he shirks it in the sermon, and confines it to a revelation to them in the preface, and as to the apostle says: "In their case also, I desire, as Paul himself obviously did, to bring the revelations made by God into the foreground, and to allow the inspired state of the human mind to fall back into a secondary place.<a name=141:3></a>"

		I only recall here in passing the utter absurdity of a theory, which would tell us that God, willing in grace to give a revelation to the whole church, and in some respects to all men, gives it in such a way that, as a revelation, it goes no farther than the one to whom it is communicated.<a name=142:1></a> It is a very convenient system for the clergy, who may desire that we should believe all that they give us as authoritative teachers, but a poor case for us Christians that we have no revelation from God.<a name=142:2></a> Our good friends will say, Were not the apostles authoritative teachers?<a name=142:3></a> Surely; but they tell us how and why.<a name=142:4></a> "For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but, as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe," 1 Thessalonians 2: 13.<a name=142:5></a> They imparted to them the gospel of God.<a name=142:6></a> It was "not yea and nay, but in him was yea" -- yea "all the promises of God" were; and Peter took care they should have the things "in remembrance," and John wrote his epistle that they "might believe.<a name=142:7></a>" There were not only authoritative teachers, which no Christian denies; but we have what was authoritatively taught, and was and is the word of God.<a name=142:8></a> Either we have what was revealed to Paul or others as purely and as fully as he received it, as he asserts (2 Corinthians 2: 17); or, the authoritative teachers being gone, we have no authoritative word of God at all.<a name=142:9></a> Nor had they directly then.<a name=142:10></a> Nor has, in fact, Dr.<a name=142:11></a> Dods any, as I will plainly shew a little farther on.<a name=142:12></a>

		But, before I turn to his more direct subject -- the historical part, there is another point I may notice, which refers also to the subject we have been upon.<a name=143:1></a> Dr.<a name=143:2></a> Dods believes the prophets when they say, "Thus saith the Lord.<a name=143:3></a>" Now in the greater part of the Pentateuch (and he will "contend for the historic credibility of the narratives") we find, "And the Lord spake unto Moses," very commonly adding, "Speak unto Aaron," or "to the priests," or "to the children of Israel, and say unto them," etc.<a name=143:4></a> Is this true?<a name=143:5></a> If so, we have, not a revelation of God in history credibly reported, but the word of God revealed to us.<a name=143:6></a> So in Deuteronomy we find "These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel," and then (chapter 4) he says, "Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish aught from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the Lord your God, which I command you.<a name=143:7></a>" Is it true, or did he deceive them or not?<a name=143:8></a> If not, all the commandments, which are inseparable in the four last books from the history, and the history with them, are the word of God.<a name=143:9></a> If it is not true, or he deceived himself, or meant to deceive others, we have no sure warrant for the history, nor any revelation of God at all.<a name=143:10></a> If it be true, we have the revelation made by God to Moses.<a name=143:11></a> I do not insist on the absurdity of a system which makes the words of the prophets in warning to the Jews, and in statements occupied with their history and future hopes as a nation, a revelation from God; and the account of the fall of man, the promises, the law, the judgment of the whole world -- a subject infinitely more important to us all -- no revelation at all.<a name=143:12></a> The absurdity of it stares every intelligent Christian in the face.<a name=143:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And now, to turn directly to the historical part of Scripture, Dr.<a name=143:14></a> Dods' theory is that God has revealed Himself in certain great acts, as the flood.<a name=143:15></a> These are revelation, and we have a credible history of them.<a name=143:16></a><a href="#143:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> Dr.<a name=143:17></a> Dods ignores here the word of God, and the operation of the Spirit of God in every way, and represents in a way utterly false the documents he is speaking of.<a name=143:18></a> Speaking of Paul's writings he says: "I may not be able at once to accept all he teaches; I cannot accept it merely because it comes to me with authority.<a name=143:19></a> I can only accept in doctrine that which fits itself in with my previously received ideas and my stage of mental growth.<a name=143:20></a>" .<a name=143:21></a>.<a name=143:22></a>.<a name=143:23></a> "Having accepted Paul or any one as an authoritative teacher, it is of course at my own risk I disagree with him in any one particular.<a name=143:24></a>" Can there be a more complete denial that it is the word of God, or of our having any revelation from God?<a name=143:25></a> Who in his senses would talk of disagreeing with God in any particular?<a name=143:26></a>

		The "Book of Origins," Ewald tells us, was a much larger work than the "Book of Covenants," and more recent, belonging to the reign of the early kings, which gives its whole character and we have much larger fragments of it.<a name=155:1></a> The date is clear from the way in which, in the midst of describing the time of the patriarchs, he is looking at his own time.<a name=155:2></a> The author of the "Book of Covenants" had only once made Jacob cast his eyes forward to the latest future, and therewith into the beclouded time of the author (time of the Judges).<a name=155:3></a> But the author of the "Book of Origins" (in Solomon's time) is bolder, and in this the voice of God appearing to the patriarchs overflows often in cheerful utterances and joyous promises for the seed or later posterity, as if the time of the author (to which such utterances with the hope that their blessings would yet last to future times properly refer), was one of the rare times which from a mighty train of complete prosperity feel themselves lifted higher, and look forward to yet greater; and we find, among other things, Abraham and Sarah and Jacob would become a multitude of nations, and kings would arise out of them.<a name=155:4></a> How then could the blessing be limited to a definite and peculiar, and so evidently accidental, a blessing as that kings should descend from the patriarchs?<a name=155:5></a> This question can never be answered unless we hold fast that the work was composed in the times of the first opening bloom of the kingdom, which furthered Israel's true good.<a name=155:6></a>

		There is, he tells us, a special charm in these accounts.<a name=156:1></a> A not less healthful than strengthening breath of an elevated spirit blows on every feeling reader, and only the author, because he lived through his own time with the warmest participation in it and a treasure of royal thoughts, could understand what was most elevated in antiquity in the liveliest way, and bring forward for posterity with a master hand what lay there not to be lost and elevating, and paint it with increasing attractiveness, without for that reason failing to recognise the higher happiness which the bloom of the present kingdom afforded.<a name=156:2></a> Then attention could be turned also to the whole state of the people as to laws, as it had formed itself gradually since the dark times of antiquity and then existed, but certainly had never till then been the exhausted subject of writing; for attempts indeed at shorter compilations of the most important laws of the people, besides the decalogue, had been made in writing, and many of them might at that time have been long written, as the oldest somewhat circumstantial attempt at a code known to us (Exodus 20: 2, or rather 23, to 23: 19), was inserted in the former work ("Book of Covenants"), and as the "Book of Origins" has adopted two smaller collections of laws.<a name=156:3></a> But the smallest trace fails us, and it is in itself improbable that the whole wide compass of all possible (denkbaren, thinkable) legal determinations and holy instructions had ever been made in writing at an earlier time.<a name=156:4></a>

		Right and law are not in all times the same.<a name=157:8></a> They change, especially according to the great changes and windings about of all human history: and yet every valid right must stand on ground above men and bind them as a divine command, as if it took effect through a covenant between God and mankind.<a name=157:9></a> And as he had the consciousness that many laws which prevailed in the community had their origin in the olden time before Moses, so he links the explanation of the obligation and use of circumcision to a suited occasion in patriarchal times.<a name=157:10></a> Hence in the proper Mosaical history he seizes every occasion to insert what is of law; expounds at the exodus from Egypt, in full detail, the laws as to the passover and firstborn; and puts off the chief subject of Mosaic institutions and laws (the sanctuary and the priestly race) into the short time of the sojourn of the people at Sinai; partly while according to all fixed remembrance the people were really formed anew under the establishment of the last great covenant of men with God, and partly because of the suitable resting-place for the exposition of a great connected collection of institutions and laws; and specially so as to the sanctuary, the highest centre of the religion and constitution of the people, and as to the ark glorified by being received into Solomon's temple, made after the pattern of that sanctuary.<a name=157:11></a> And thus the author starts from that visible sanctuary (the temple) in his sketch of the whole that was to be pictured; describes it with all that belonged to it as made according to the divine pattern shewn and prescribed to Moses; and then gives the sacrifices and their order and use.<a name=157:12></a> Only Numbers 19 ought to be inserted after Leviticus 16.<a name=157:13></a>

		If we treat now the whole manner and way in which the author puts in order and describes the Mosaic laws in recounting the history, there cannot be the smallest doubt that it is solely on this account that he describes them as communicated from Jehovah to Moses, and through Moses to the congregation, or Aaron, if the contents concern the priesthood; namely, that, as in his time they were in force as holy, an historian could only place their origin in that commencement of the congregation.<a name=158:1></a> They had won their force and holiness through long use, and so the author puts them as divine commands.<a name=158:2></a> Hence he has to seek what goes back to Moses' time, and what gradually or from other causes had come in.<a name=158:3></a> The author does not set up to be Moses.<a name=158:4></a> And when a prescription in the connected whole of the description applied only to the land, not in the wilderness, the author makes Moses announce it prophetically, sometimes with the addition, "When ye are come into the land.<a name=158:5></a>" He revives the law-giving time, and depicts Moses and Joshua as models of leaders of the people, himself imbued with the same spirit.<a name=158:6></a> And certainly he took much out of the former historical work, or worked it up after his own manner, and took what was already in it, the inimitably described manifestation at Sinai, and with it the decalogue (where the words Exodus 20: 9-11 are an addition from himself), the rather, as it was necessary in itself.<a name=158:7></a> He then praises largely the author for a priestly, lawgiving, leading royal spirit, and closes with thus apostrophising the author's elevated spirit whose writings have for centuries succeeded in being taken for those of the great hero Moses himself.<a name=158:8></a> "I know not thy name, and guess only from thy traces where thou walkedst in time, and what thou didst; but these traces lead me irrecusably on not to take thee immediately for him who was greater than thee, and whom thou couldst thyself honour as he deserved.<a name=158:9></a> So see that in me there is nothing false, and no desire not to recognise thee altogether as thou wast.<a name=158:10></a>"

		Having given Ewald's estimate of the historical books, and, where it was of moment, in his own words, as regards the two chief original histories, the rest need not occupy us long.<a name=159:1></a> There were, he tells us, a third, fourth, and, in the second edition, a fifth narrator, who worked it up.<a name=159:2></a> And here remark it is not that there were original documents used, which is possible: but what we have is the work of those who composed the history.<a name=159:3></a> The earliest (save a small fragment or two of a life of Moses, and the Book of the Wars of the Lord) was composed in the time of Samson; we have not even the ten commandments as they were originally given.<a name=159:4></a> The various morsels of the third narrator are given in page 145 (third edition).<a name=159:5></a> The special excellence of this writer is the uncommonly high and clear view of the work of the prophetic and divine Spirit which appears more or less in different minds, and gives us some of the finest pieces in the Old Testament, as Numbers 11.<a name=159:6></a> Still though elevated, he is far from the artistic painting and bolder picturing of him (the fourth) who will soon be described.<a name=159:7></a> He had much to do with the account of Joseph, but a good deal was woven in afterwards.<a name=159:8></a> He lived in the time of the prophets Joel and Elias, in the ninth or tenth century before Christ, and belonged to the northern kingdom, so that his work was for it what the "Book of Origins" was for Judah.<a name=159:9></a> He gives the different bits in the Pentateuch which belong to this writer.<a name=159:10></a> I shall only give what shews the estimate of these new German views, which are to replace inspiration and the revelation of divine thoughts and intentions in the word of God.<a name=159:11></a> The pieces of the fourth narrator shew a high and ripest cultivation of all spiritual powers and capacities of the ancient people which can hardly be surpassed.<a name=159:12></a> One may justly maintain that, in the handling of the original early history, this work presents the progress to the extremest freedom of conception and picturing beyond which nothing more is possible as the pure artistic giving form to, and profiting by, legend; and one recognises easily, in the form of the whole popular life of the time which shines out from it, the commencing of loosening the chains of the old limits of the Mosaic religion, and the powerful rising again of many new thoughts and strivings.<a name=159:13></a>

		Mr.<a name=175:1></a> Smith with versatile inconsistency, which on such a subject is the most culpable want of seriousness, says that he believes for other reasons in inspiration, when he has published what he holds to be proof, borrowed indeed from others, that they are mere human compositions; and draws from and authenticates, unless I much mistake, the worse class of infidels, that is, those who are more open and impudent in their treatment of Scripture.<a name=175:2></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My Dear Brother, <br>I send you some details on the statements made in the papers you sent me.<a name=176:2></a> Mr.<a name=176:3></a> Smith says, Ezra 9: 11 proves that Deuteronomy 7 must be from the prophets; but we have exactly the same statement in Exodus 34: 11-17; so that his proof proves nothing, unless Exodus be from the prophets too.<a name=176:4></a> But prophet is a mere word for those who spoke the word of God, as Abraham is called a prophet, and Moses.<a name=176:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Besides, the argument is an absurdity.<a name=176:6></a> It is an absurdity to pretend that Ezra, a ready scribe in the law of Moses, who, it is alleged, compiled it in its last form, should speak as if it was not given by Moses at all, and say it was the prophets, and yet say, in the same sentence, Israel was going into the land to possess it when the commandment was given, as he does.<a name=176:7></a> Only a rationalist, who can believe anything but the simple truth, but no one of sound sense, could swallow such a fancy as this.<a name=176:8></a> If Ezra referred to Deuteronomy (which is very likely, as he speaks of going in to possess the land, which characterises that book), then he assuredly refers to it as given before the Israelites entered into the land.<a name=176:9></a> None but those accustomed to assume, and justify too, forgery in documents which pretend to be divine, could allege that Ezra attributes to prophets of the seventh or eighth century a statement of the law which he was teaching as the law of Moses; and, in the deep grief of his heart about their sins before God, accredit and state the forgery in speaking to God.<a name=176:10></a> Upon the face of it, to apply "thy servants the prophets" (saying, "the land into which ye go to possess it") to prophets hundreds of years after they possessed it, is a gross absurdity.<a name=176:11></a> The defilement of the land is not particularly spoken of in Deuteronomy 7; it is much more in other chapters, and more especially in Leviticus 18.<a name=176:12></a>

		As to the canon, one was really a love-song about the purity of northern Israel contrasted with Solomon, which we should have lost but for a false theory about its being an allegory; but the bewilderment and anxiety was not about the inspiration or canon of Scripture, nor whether we are to have the whole Bible!<a name=179:1></a> But Mr.<a name=179:2></a> Smith and all agree, we are told, that the Bible is inspired.<a name=179:3></a> What then was his article about?<a name=179:4></a> The escape from the difficulty is: The question is not about inspiration, but whether certain positions brought in, in connection with the explanation of Professor Smith's views on the Bible, are really inconsistent with this position.<a name=179:5></a> A queer roundabout sentence; but have we no views of Mr.<a name=179:6></a> Smith on the Bible, or on parts of it?<a name=179:7></a> Nothing but positions in connection with the explanation of his views?<a name=179:8></a> And is what every one knows to be characteristic of modern infidelity in the theological sphere to be spread broadcast by professors of theology, without a hint of anything else?<a name=179:9></a> Nay, accepting really as desirable progress views that are to every honest mind totally destructive of the inspiration of Scripture, and then to be told there is no question about inspiration?<a name=179:10></a> And how is it excused in a compromising way?<a name=179:11></a> We are not, we are told, to deal with it as if some party were rising up to unsettle and undermine these great doctrines.<a name=179:12></a> But a party has arisen up, and, as every one occupied with these subjects knows, unsettling and undermining these great doctrines; and all that Mr.<a name=179:13></a> Smith has done is to popularise them in a well-known book of general science, the <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i>, wherever the English language is spoken in the two continents.<a name=179:14></a> He has reproduced and disseminated for all English readers, and as valid, the wellknown modern grounds of infidelity as to these great truths.<a name=179:15></a> Scotland and the Free Church have been the source, or.<a name=179:16></a> if not the source, the instrument, of spreading over the world modern infidelity as to inspiration and the canon of Scripture, as a part of the more accurate knowledge of modern science in a popular publication.<a name=179:17></a> This is the broad fact, and no special pleading in church courts and committees in Scotland will alter it; nor, it is to be feared, if the Free Church clear itself, undo it.<a name=179:18></a>

		UNION IN INCARNATION, THE ROOT ERROR OF MODERN THEOLOGY
	</div>

		The Wesleyans have not, that I know of, the doctrine of such union of Christ with fallen humanity, but they take up in practice its effect, with the assertion of some good in fallen man, and that what is wrought in salvation is the setting right the first Adam, not the communication of a totally new life.<a name=185:10></a> The German doctors agree with them in this.<a name=185:11></a> Without it, they say, there is no "Anknupfungspunkt," no point to which grace can attach itself.<a name=185:12></a> Now God does act on man's knowledge of good and evil, or conscience, but a new life is given.<a name=185:13></a> Christ, the last Adam becoming our life in contrast with the first, needs no "Anknupfungspunkt.<a name=185:14></a>" Irving held that Christ, while sinless in word or deed, had a sinful human nature; lust, where the will did not consent, not being sin, as is held by Roman Catholics, Wesleyans, and a very great many others, as for example, our modern perfectionists -- a horrible error.<a name=185:15></a> The apostle Paul expressly makes sin the source of lust in Romans 7.<a name=185:16></a> It is an error which makes void the tenth commandment, as he there uses it.<a name=185:17></a> Christ, according to Irving, by the Holy Ghost kept sin in the flesh down, and so kept all His ways holy, and was perfect, and obtained thus the Holy Ghost for us, that we may do the same.<a name=185:18></a> The substitution of Christ as bearing our sins, and therefore dying for us, he expressly denied (and the truth of the atonement, viewed as substitution, is involved in the question), holding that He died because of what He was as a mortal man, not because of our sins.<a name=185:19></a> I need not go farther into his doctrine.<a name=185:20></a>

		This leads me to the second point -- the form the error takes when union with sinful man in incarnation is not so distinctly held as by the Germans and their scholars among Presbyterians and Baptists -- namely, that nothing new is given to man; that the old and new man are not contrasted in the renewed man; but that there is simply a renewal of man as he is, in his affections, thoughts, and whole soul.<a name=194:13></a> Such is the Wesleyan doctrine.<a name=194:14></a> Such is the basis of perfectionism; such is the current doctrine amidst crowds of Christians and their teachers, exalting the first man to the losing of the full and blessed truth of grace in the Second.<a name=194:15></a> Amidst a large class, such as the Wesleyans, it has taken this form: man, body, soul, and spirit, was in a good state before the fall, in a bad state after it; then, by the operation of the Spirit, in a good state again.<a name=194:16></a> And thus, they consistently hold, a man may be born again ten times a week, and also be perfect; but it is the perfection of the first man, not of a Christ in glory, conformity to whom is alone spoken of as our goal in Scripture.<a name=194:17></a> With all classes who have these views, varying in details, lust is not sin, unless the will consents -- a horrible, unholy doctrine; and denying that sin in the flesh is condemned, and the whole truth of the fallen state of man.<a name=194:18></a> But my part is to see and state what Scripture says as to this, not now to go into details as to the false doctrine itself.<a name=194:19></a> Possibly at the close, if there be any profit in it, I may state, from the respective writings of those who hold them, the views into which this evil root of doctrine has branched out.<a name=194:20></a>

It shews the danger of those early discussions, for the simple faith that Jesus was God and man in one Person can be easily accepted as plain and vital truth; but the moment you deny personality in the man Christ Jesus, you run into a thousand difficulties and errors. What is really denied is Christ's individuality as a man, as it is in terms elsewhere.

		But let us consider this doctrine of the church scripturally and historically too: for these doctors avoid history to replace it by dreams of their own fancy.<a name=229:10></a> We have the church or assembly of God under three aspects in Scripture, primarily two, and then one of the two as the effect of divine workmanship, and as the effect of the work as entrusted to the responsibility of man: "The body," if we speak of that which is united to Christ, the glorified Head in heaven (Ephesians 1, 5; compare 1 Corinthians 12), set up on earth, but to be complete and perfected in heaven, is not formed by baptism.<a name=229:11></a> Simon Magus, for instance, was baptised, but had neither part nor lot in the matter; the one hundred and twenty at Jerusalem had formed the nucleus of the church but were never baptised at all.<a name=229:12></a> There is no trace of it, nor anybody to do it: yet they were the church itself at its starting.<a name=229:13></a> It is, we are expressly told, "by one Spirit we are baptised into one body.<a name=229:14></a>" This baptism, we know from Acts 1, was on the day of Pentecost.<a name=229:15></a> The truth concerning this one body was more fully developed in Paul's ministry.<a name=229:16></a> But Christ exalted on high was the Head, those who had the Holy Ghost the members.<a name=229:17></a> He that is joined to the Lord is one spirit.<a name=229:18></a> It is never connected with water-baptism, nor are there rotten members of Christ's body.<a name=229:19></a> An unbeliever not born of God is not a member of Christ's body!<a name=229:20></a> He is "without Christ"; nay, more, "If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.<a name=229:21></a>" "Ye are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if so be the Spirit of God dwell in you.<a name=229:22></a>" "There is no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus.<a name=229:23></a>" "The whole body edifies itself in love"; they are "members one of another.<a name=229:24></a>" The "Head is Christ, from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, maketh increase of the body to the edifying of itself in love.<a name=229:25></a>" So "there is one Spirit and one body, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling"; and then "one Lord, one faith, one baptism"; and then "one God and Father of all": the circle each time widening -- with the Spirit, the Lord, and God the Father.<a name=229:26></a> The same distinction is made in 1 Corinthians 12.<a name=229:27></a>

		THE ATONEMENT
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is in John 3 a twofold aspect of Christ presented to us, as the object of faith, through which we do not perish but have everlasting life.<a name=241:1></a> As Son of man, He must be lifted up; as only-begotten Son of God, He is given by the infinite love of God.<a name=241:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Many souls stop at the first, the Son of man's meeting the necessity in which men stood as sinners before God, and do not look on to that infinite love of God which gave His onlybegotten Son -- the love which provided the needed lamb, the true source of all this work of grace, which stamps on it its true character and effect, and without which it could not be.<a name=241:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence such souls have not true peace and liberty with God.<a name=241:4></a> Practically for them the love is only in Christ, and God remains a just and unbending judge.<a name=241:5></a> They do not really know Him, the God of love, our Saviour.<a name=241:6></a> Others alas!<a name=241:7></a> with more fatal error, false as to their own state and God's holiness, with no true or adequate sense of sin, reject all true propitiation.<a name=241:8></a> The "must be lifted up" has no moral force for them, nothing that the conscience with a true sense of sin needs.<a name=241:9></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The statement of John 3 begins with the need of man in view of what God is, as indeed it must; but it gives as the source and result of it for the soul, its measure too in grace, that which was in the heart of God towards a ruined world.<a name=241:16></a> As in Hebrews 10, to give us boldness to enter into the holiest, the origin is "Lo!<a name=241:17></a> I come to do thy will; by the which will we are sanctified by the offering of the body of Jesus Christ, once for all.<a name=241:18></a>" The offering was the means, but He was accomplishing the will of God in grace, and by the exercise of the same grace in which He came to do it: for "hereby know we love, that he laid down his life for us.<a name=241:19></a>" So in Romans 5 God commends His love to us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.<a name=241:20></a> It is summed up in the full saying: Grace reigns through righteousness unto eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=241:21></a>

		This point being premised, and it is an important one, I add that we cannot present too simply the value of Christ's blood, and redemption and forgiveness through it, to the awakened sinner whom that love may have drawn to feel his need; for by need, and because of need, the sinner must come -- it is his only just place before God.<a name=242:1></a> The love of God, and even His love announced in forgiveness through the work of Christ, may, through the power of the Holy Ghost, awaken the sense of need; still having the forgiveness is another thing.<a name=242:2></a> That love brought home to the soul through grace, produces confidence not peace; but it does produce confidence.<a name=242:3></a> Hence we come into the light.<a name=242:4></a> God is light and God is love.<a name=242:5></a> Christ in the world was the light of the world, and He was there in divine love.<a name=242:6></a> Grace and truth came <i>(egeneto)</i> by Jesus Christ.<a name=242:7></a> When God reveals Himself, He must be both -- light and love.<a name=242:8></a> The love draws and produces confidence; as with the woman in the city who was a sinner, the prodigal, Peter in the boat The light shews us our sinfulness.<a name=242:9></a> We are before God according to the truth of what He is, and the truth of what we are.<a name=242:10></a> But the atonement does more than shew this; it meets and is the answer to our case when known.<a name=242:11></a> It is the ground, through faith, of forgiveness and peace.<a name=242:12></a> (See Luke 7: 47-50.<a name=242:13></a>) Christ could anticipate His work, and the child of wisdom go in peace The law may by grace reach the conscience and make us feel our guilt, but it does not reveal God in love.<a name=242:14></a> But that love has done what was needed for our sinful state.<a name=242:15></a> Hereby know we love, that He laid down His life for us.<a name=242:16></a> He was delivered for our offences, died for our sins according to the Scriptures, is the propitiation for our sins, set forth as a mercy-seat through faith in His blood, which cleanses from all sin.<a name=242:17></a> With His stripes we are healed.<a name=242:18></a> I might multiply passages; I only now cite these, that the simple basis of the gospel on the one side, and on the other the work that love has wrought to purge our sins and withal our consciences, so that we may be in peace before a holy God, who is of purer eyes than to behold evil and cannot look on iniquity, may be simply and fully before us.<a name=242:19></a>

		We must come as sinners to God, because we are sinners; and we can only come in virtue of that which, while it is the fruit of God's love, meets according to His holy nature the sins we are guilty of.<a name=242:20></a> But then, while it is true that our sins are removed far from us who believe through grace, as they were carried into a land not inhabited by the scapegoat in Israel, yet we have only an imperfect view of the matter in seeing our sins put away.<a name=242:21></a> In that great day of atonement the blood was sprinkled on the mercy-seat and before it; just as it was sprinkled on the lintel and two door-posts to meet God's eye.<a name=242:22></a> "When I see the blood," He says, "I will pass over.<a name=242:23></a>" It was in view of the sin of Israel, but presented to God.<a name=242:24></a> The goat whose blood was shed was called, on the great day of atonement, "Jehovah's lot.<a name=242:25></a>" The blood was carried within; so it was with the bullock, and with the bullock it was exclusively this.<a name=242:26></a> The testimony was there, blessed be God, that as dwellers on the earth our sins have been carried off where none shall find them; but what characterised the day was putting the blood on the mercy-seat -- presenting it to God.<a name=242:27></a> On this day only, too, it was done.<a name=242:28></a> In the case of the sin of the congregation, or of the high priest, it was sprinkled on the altar outside the veil; but on the great day of atonement alone on the mercy-seat within.<a name=242:29></a>

		Now, though the sinner must come as guilty and because of his need, and can come rightly in no other way, as the poor prodigal and so many other actual cases, yet this does not reach to the full character of propitiation or atonement, though in fact involving it.<a name=243:1></a> The divine glory and nature are in question.<a name=243:2></a> In coming we come by our need and wants; but if we have passed in through the veil, we can contemplate the work of Christ in peace, as viewed in connection with God's nature, though on our part referring to sin.<a name=243:3></a> The sins, then, were carried away on the scapegoat, but what God is was specially in view in the blood carried within the veil.<a name=243:4></a> The sins were totally and for ever taken off the believers, and never found; but there was much more in that which did it, and much more even for us.<a name=243:5></a> God's character and nature were met in the atonement, and through this we have boldness to enter into the holiest.<a name=243:6></a> This distinction appears in the ordinary sacrifices.<a name=243:7></a> They were offered on the brazen altar, and the blood sprinkled there.<a name=243:8></a> Man's responsibility was the measure of what was required.<a name=243:9></a> His case was met as to guilt; but if he was to come to God, into His presence, he must be fit for the holiness of that presence.<a name=243:10></a>

		And this marks the two parts of propitiation -- man's responsibility, and access to God given according to His glory and nature: in the sins borne and put away, the scapegoat, God judging evil according to what man ought to be; and access to God according to what He is.<a name=245:1></a> The last specifically characterises the Christian; but the former was necessary, and accomplished for every one that believes; both by the same work of the cross, but each distinct -- judicial dealing according to man's responsibility, access to God according to His nature and holiness.<a name=245:2></a> I he law in itself was the measure of the former, the child of Adam's duty; the nature of God, of the latter, so that we have the infinite blessedness of being with God according to His nature and perfection, partaking of the divine nature, so as to be able to enjoy it, holy and without blame before Him in love.<a name=245:3></a> Of this Christ as Man, and we must add as Son withal, is the measure and perfection; and let it not be said that, if we partake of this nature, we need not this propitiation and substitution.<a name=245:4></a> This can only be said or supposed by those who have not got it; because, if we partake of the divine nature, we judge of sin in principle as God does, we have His mind as to it, and as upright of ourselves as in it, and so come, as I have said, first in lowliness in our need to the cross, and, then purged in conscience, comprehend the glory of God in it.<a name=245:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These two points, in their general aspect, are clearly presented in Hebrews 9: 26-28: Christ appeared once in the end of the world to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself; and as it is appointed unto men once to die, and after that the judgment, so Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many.<a name=245:6></a> It is carried out in application in chapter 10, where we have no more conscience of sins, and boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus.<a name=245:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But this leads us to a still wider bearing of the work of the cross.<a name=245:8></a> The whole question of good and evil was brought to an issue there: man in absolute wickedness and hatred against God manifested in goodness and love; Satan's whole power as prince of this world, and having the power of death; man in perfect goodness in Christ, obedience and love to His Father, and this in the place of sin as made it, for it was there the need was for God's glory and eternal redemption; God in perfect righteousness, and majesty, and in perfect love.<a name=245:9></a> So that all was perfectly settled morally for ever.<a name=245:10></a> The fruits will be only complete in the new heavens and new earth, though the value of that work be now known to faith; but what is eternal is settled for ever by it, for its value is such and cannot change.<a name=245:11></a>

		Here let me remark that, if I do not mistake him, Dr.<a name=249:1></a> W.<a name=249:2></a>, with all who rest in theological traditions, reckons Adam to be righteous and holy.<a name=249:3></a> He was neither, but innocent.<a name=249:4></a> To be righteous or holy requires the knowledge of good and evil, and this Adam had not till he fell; and the difference is immense.<a name=249:5></a> We have only to speak of God as innocent, and the believer's heart at once revolts from it -- is offended by it.<a name=249:6></a> Righteous and holy He surely is.<a name=249:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This difference in Adam is clearly and formally stated in Scripture.<a name=249:8></a> It was the promise of Satan (Genesis 3: 5), and Jehovah Elohim declares it to be so (verse 22).<a name=249:9></a> Tradition has falsified all this, but the word is clear and certain.<a name=249:10></a> It does not mean, "You shall know evil who before knew only good.<a name=249:11></a>" Would Satan have proposed such a thing as this to him, or, still more, could it have this sense in God's mouth?<a name=249:12></a> "The man is become as one of us, knowing good and evil.<a name=249:13></a>" No, he was before innocent, and now makes inwardly the difference between right and wrong, not merely by an imposed law as tradition teaches, but inwardly as God does, though he may be hardened or misled as God cannot be.<a name=249:14></a> We must not confound the rule for conscience with conscience.<a name=249:15></a> The law is the perfect rule for the conscience of Adam's fallen children, Christ's walk for the Christian; and this the soul taught of God accepts, and with delight.<a name=249:16></a> The conscience takes knowledge of the difference of what is right and what is wrong.<a name=249:17></a>

		Further, the question is not, as Dr.<a name=250:1></a> W.<a name=250:2></a> states it, "If the fall was an obstacle in the way of man's salvation.<a name=250:3></a>" It was no obstacle to his salvation.<a name=250:4></a> Salvation was not needed without the fall; but it was an obstacle, and in itself an absolute one, to man's acceptance as he was.<a name=250:5></a> Christ came to save what was lost, and that, because God was not changed but remained holy and righteous -- is "of purer eyes than to behold evil and cannot look on iniquity.<a name=250:6></a>" I do not speak of God's wrath against the world being the obstacle; but the unconverted man is under wrath, a child of wrath.<a name=250:7></a> I do not say this was an obstacle to salvation; it was not, because God was sovereign in goodness.<a name=250:8></a>

		But Scripture does not speak of the matter as Dr.<a name=250:9></a> W.<a name=250:10></a> does.<a name=250:11></a> He asks, "How could he be propitiated that loved?<a name=250:12></a>" A person who loves deeply and truly may require something in order that he may shew favour.<a name=250:13></a> The eternal maintenance of the unchangeableness of God's character, of the nature of good and evil as He sees it, may require it.<a name=250:14></a> Not merely man's being saved is in question, for that is not the result of Christ's death as to all men, if He did die for all, but the public testimony to the immutability of God's nature, and to maintain it in the sight of the universe; yea, to lay the foundation of the immutable blessing of the new heavens and the new earth according to what God is, supreme as righteous, holy, and love.<a name=250:15></a> A father with the most perfect love to his child may require for the order of his family that satisfaction to his authority, what maintains it before all, and the rules of his house, be done.<a name=250:16></a> "It became him [God] for whom are all things and by whom are all things in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings," Hebrews 2: 10.<a name=250:17></a> It became Him.<a name=250:18></a> Did He not love that blessed One?<a name=250:19></a> Yet it became Him to do this.<a name=250:20></a> So that this statement of Dr.<a name=250:21></a> W.<a name=250:22></a>'s is alike inadequate and incorrect.<a name=250:23></a> There is that which becomes God because of what He is, which is not love, though love be His unchangeable nature.<a name=250:24></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And now see how Scripture actually speaks of the very point.<a name=250:25></a> It does not simply say that, where sin abounded, love did much more abound, but grace did much more abound.<a name=250:26></a> But more.<a name=250:27></a> We were by nature the children of wrath: it was our natural inheritance from God; for whose wrath is spoken of?<a name=250:28></a> What belonged to us?<a name=250:29></a> "But God who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us.<a name=250:30></a>" So that wrath against us, as our natural portion from God, is not inconsistent with infinite and sovereign love.<a name=250:31></a> Thus Christ in the synagogue looked upon them with anger, being grieved at the hardness of their hearts.<a name=250:32></a> The grief was love, the anger His righteous estimate of their sin.<a name=250:33></a>

		Farther on Dr.<a name=251:17></a> W.<a name=251:18></a> admits that there is wrath against sin in God's mind, and therefore against the sinner while he abides in the sin; but what God does is to take away the criminality by Christ, and so He can love the sinner, and His wrath has no ground as the sin is gone.<a name=251:19></a> Now, as thus put, it is merely the personal state of the sinner which removes the wrath in removing the occasion of it.<a name=251:20></a> And this is doubly, and in every way false.<a name=251:21></a> First, it mars the perfectness of God's sovereign love.<a name=251:22></a> God loved us while we were sinners, and this is characteristic of His love, His saving love; and, secondly, it ignores the righteousness of God, and the work by which judicially the sins were put away.<a name=251:23></a> I do not mean that he denies that Christ died for our sins as a fact; but it is merely the effect in us which removes the wrath, the state we are in which leaves God free to love us; our criminality is gone, we are cleansed, so there is no object of wrath left because we are clean.<a name=251:24></a> He speaks indeed of God's wrath being His justice, but all his reasoning is that there is no "change in the disposition from anger to kindness.<a name=251:25></a>"

		But peace had to be made when there was wrath, and the sovereign love that saves is not the favour which rests on those reconciled; Romans 5: 1.<a name=251:26></a> God loved us when we were sinners; He loves us without any change when we are cleansed.<a name=251:27></a> But we are cleansed, reconciled, we are told.<a name=251:28></a> Now I fully recognise, and insist on it, that God loved us when we were sinners, and that we are reconciled.<a name=251:29></a> But then, according to Dr.<a name=251:30></a> W.<a name=251:31></a>, the only change is in our state, which leaves God free to love us; whereas He loved us when we were in our sins.<a name=251:32></a> The change spoken of is by the operation and work of grace in us.<a name=251:33></a> The work of Christ we needed is wholly left out.<a name=251:34></a> I do not mean that Dr.<a name=251:35></a> W.<a name=251:36></a> in terms denies there was an atonement; he says, Scripture teaches the necessity of an atonement.<a name=251:37></a> But what is this?<a name=251:38></a> Is it anything towards God?<a name=251:39></a> "The reconciliation must be effected by our recovering the righteousness in which God through His righteousness could again become our eternal life.<a name=251:40></a>" There are as many errors as thoughts here; but I only notice now that the mediatorial work of atonement is simply a change in our actual state, otherwise "the righteous One is a consuming fire for the unrighteous," and so over and over again.<a name=251:41></a> I quote one passage more: "No: where there is sin, there is wrath; God's wrath is unchangeably manifest, as sure as God is God.<a name=251:42></a>" I ask in passing, Is there no sin in us?<a name=251:43></a> "His justice can take no other form against sin but that of wrath, and it is impossible that there should be sin without the wrath of God.<a name=251:44></a>" "But where there is righteousness, there is no wrath to be quenched, for there can be none.<a name=251:45></a>" "But an individual who is blameless respecting the law is outside its wrath, and instead thereof enjoys its blessings.<a name=251:46></a>" Did God then not love us when we were sinners?<a name=251:47></a> If He did, and it is impossible there should be sin without the wrath of God, wrath and love go together.<a name=251:48></a> All Dr.<a name=251:49></a> W.<a name=251:50></a>'s system is false.<a name=251:51></a>

		The truth is, all this confounds divine favour resting on us in Christ, and sovereign love to the sinner.<a name=252:1></a> The first part of what the Lord says in John 3 is thus left out: "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up.<a name=252:2></a>" The Son of man, He who represented man, must be lifted up -- die on the cross, and where was such a lamb to be found?<a name=252:3></a> "God so loved the world that he gave his onlybegotten Son.<a name=252:4></a>" The "Son of man" must be lifted up, the "Son of God" was given, the same blessed Person; but "Son of man," to die for man's need, standing for man before God; "Son of God," vessel and proof of God's sovereign love.<a name=252:5></a> He is therefore spoken of as representing man, which Dr.<a name=252:6></a> W.<a name=252:7></a> denies, and not merely God.<a name=252:8></a> Nor did He, properly speaking, represent God in dying, nor in being made sin.<a name=252:9></a> His doing so was the effect of God's infinite love to man, which was His own withal; but in the work thus wrought He suffered as Son of man made sin.<a name=252:10></a> This could not represent God.<a name=252:11></a> If the world be reconciled, the relationship is changed, though God be not.<a name=252:12></a> But this Scripture never says.<a name=252:13></a><a href="#252:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> Christ, Dr.<a name=252:14></a> W.<a name=252:15></a> tells us, "was struck by the curse of God's wrath against sin.<a name=252:16></a>" "He descended," he says, "into our sin," and so was "struck by the curse of God's wrath.<a name=252:17></a>"<a href="#252:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a> Whom did He represent then?<a name=252:18></a> Was Christ, as Man made sin for us and struck by the curse, representing God in this place?<a name=252:19></a> That His doing so was the effect of infinite divine love is true; but did sin, and wrath, and the curse represent in the infliction of it God's love or God's righteous wrath against sin?<a name=252:20></a> By the grace of God He tasted death, being made a little lower than the angels to that end; but was His tasting death, and drinking that dreadful cup, and sweating as it were great drops of blood at only thinking of it, God's love to Him or apprehended by Him?<a name=252:21></a> Did He pray, that if it were possible, the cup might pass, meaning the cup of God's love?<a name=252:22></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#252:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>The Swedish translation in 2 Corinthians 5: 19 says, God has reconciled the world, not God was in Christ reconciling. So far, Dr. W. is excusable; but he knows Greek. The translator is inexcusable. I suppose he followed Luther, who also so translates it. But there is no possible pretence for so translating it in the Greek; the Vulgate does not. And so far from being reconciled, the world rejected Him when He came. Hence the ministry of the apostle was beseeching them to be reconciled. I shall always treat the passage as it really is.

		I have nothing to do with the traditions of theologians and do not notice them, but with what the word of God brings before us.<a name=280:8></a> I have spoken of this at the beginning as to principles; but Dr.<a name=280:9></a> W.<a name=280:10></a> brings it all again forward here, and it is the kernel of the question.<a name=280:11></a> I agree with him, reconciling God is not spoken of; but he is one-sided in hiding a mass of truth which Scripture puts clearly forward.<a name=280:12></a> All that is said as to God being what He is in His revelation of Himself is delusion.<a name=280:13></a> God is love, God is light.<a name=280:14></a> But God could not act in wrath to man innocent (for man was neither righteous nor holy, as theologians say) -- He would not have been righteous -- and wrath was not revealed nor judgment, but, solely, the consequence of disobedience that man would die.<a name=280:15></a> All that Dr.<a name=280:16></a> W.<a name=280:17></a> takes up, and all that was said when man was judged in paradise.<a name=280:18></a> But God did act in wrath when he had sinned, and turned him out of paradise, and shut the way of the tree of life; but it was not revealed before, and surely not executed, nor was love revealed as it was in redemption.<a name=280:19></a> Christ was God's representative on earth, the image of the invisible God.<a name=280:20></a> But whose representative was He when made sin, and what was the consequence to Him?<a name=280:21></a> With the theories Dr.<a name=280:22></a> W.<a name=280:23></a> opposes I have nothing to do.<a name=280:24></a> He joins with his adversaries in holding that God reconciled the world to Himself; and from this common error one draws his theological consequences, which I refuse, as they are not in Scripture, and the other hides other plain scriptural statements and falls into denying them.<a name=280:25></a>

		Here, in this section X, Dr.<a name=281:1></a> W.<a name=281:2></a>, as I have already said he did, speaks of wrath.<a name=281:3></a> But then how can he say, "Nothing remains besides and behind but God so loved the world"?<a name=281:4></a> Because the momentous fact of wrath remains.<a name=281:5></a> Perhaps he will tell us, Yes, but the world was reconciled, which is totally unscriptural, and how reconciled so that there is no wrath, if the wrath of God abides upon them, as Scripture says and Dr.<a name=281:6></a> W.<a name=281:7></a> admits, and Christ is our deliverer from the wrath to come?<a name=281:8></a> Yea, they are "heaping up unto themselves wrath against the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God.<a name=281:9></a>" Dr.<a name=281:10></a> W.<a name=281:11></a> says this reconciliation is "not a change of disposition, but of relative position, placing in another relation to a person"; but how in another relative position when the wrath of God abides on him?<a name=281:12></a> That wrath is not executed now (save in chastisement for our good in love, called "wrath" in Scripture, Job 36), and that it is the accepted time, the day of salvation, is true: the wrath is "to come"; but "he that believeth not is condemned already," the "wrath of God abideth upon him.<a name=281:13></a>" Dr.<a name=281:14></a> W.<a name=281:15></a> tells us God cannot be angry and love at the same time.<a name=281:16></a> If so, there is no wrath abiding on the unbeliever, as he admits it is, or he is not loved.<a name=281:17></a>

		I have only to remark, again, that Dr.<a name=282:1></a> W.<a name=282:2></a> avoids the question; namely, that saying the object of the atonement was to justify the sinner (which all will admit was one object) does not touch the real question: What was done there in order to justify him?<a name=282:3></a> What were the stripes with which we are healed?<a name=282:4></a> Herein we find again the utterly anti-scriptural doctrine: "The race of Adam was herein justified.<a name=282:5></a>" We are justified by faith, not without it, though it be through the atonement.<a name=282:6></a> The saved are righteous in Christ, but "salvation only for the righteous" is as unscriptural as possibly can be.<a name=282:7></a> Christ came to save sinners -- "not to call the righteous, but sinners.<a name=282:8></a>" God justifies "the ungodly.<a name=282:9></a>" Christ came "to seek and to save that which was lost.<a name=282:10></a>" This is another fundamental fallacy of Dr.<a name=282:11></a> W.<a name=282:12></a>, that we are justified by being made personally righteous.<a name=282:13></a>

		PROPITIATION AND SUBSTITUTION
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My intercourse with saints, and especially with those who preach, has led me to discover that a good deal of obscurity in their manner of putting the gospel (and I may add a good deal of Arminian and Calvinistic controversy) arises from not distinguishing propitiation and substitution.<a name=286:1></a> I am not anxious about the words, but about the practical distinction, which is very simple, and, I think, of moment.<a name=286:2></a> I say the words, because in propitiation, in a certain sense, Christ stood in our stead.<a name=286:3></a> Still there is a very real difference in Scripture.<a name=286:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This difference is clearly marked in the offering of the great day of atonement.<a name=286:5></a> Aaron slew the bullock and the goat, which was called Jehovah's lot, and sprinkled the blood on and before the mercy-seat and on the altar.<a name=286:6></a> The blood was presented to God, whose holy presence had been dishonoured and offended by sin.<a name=286:7></a> So Christ has perfectly glorified God in the place of sin, by His perfect obedience and love to His Father, in His being made sin who knew no sin.<a name=286:8></a> God's majesty, righteousness, love, truth, all that He is, was glorified in the work wrought by Christ, and of this the blood was witness in the holy place itself.<a name=286:9></a> Our sins gave occasion to it; but God Himself was glorified in it.<a name=286:10></a> Hence the testimony can go out to all the world that God is, more than satisfied, glorified; and whoever comes by that blood is freely, fully, received of God and to God.<a name=286:11></a> But there was no confession of sins on the head of this goat; it was about sin by reason of Israel's sinfulness; but it was simply blood offered to God.<a name=286:12></a> Sin had been dealt with in judgment according to God's glory; yea, to the full glorifying of God; for never were His majesty, love, and hatred of sin so seen.<a name=286:13></a> God could shine out in favour to the returning sinner according to what He was; yea, in the infiniteness of His love, could beseech men to return.<a name=286:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But besides this there was personal guilt, positive personal sins, for which Israel was responsible, and men are responsible, according to what is righteously required from each.<a name=286:15></a> On the great day of atonement the high priest confessed the people's sins on the scapegoat, laying both his hands on its head; the personal sins were transferred to the goat by one who represented all the people, and they were gone for ever, never found again.<a name=286:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=287>[Page 287]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this is another thing.<a name=287:1></a> Christ is both high priest and victim, has confessed all the sins of His people as His own, and borne our sins in His own body on the tree.<a name=287:2></a> The two goats are but one Christ; but there is the double aspect of His sacrifice, Godward, and bearing our sins.<a name=287:3></a> The blood is the witness of the accomplishment of all, and He is entered in not without blood.<a name=287:4></a> He is the propitiation for our sins.<a name=287:5></a> But in this aspect the world comes in too.<a name=287:6></a> He is a propitiation for the whole world.<a name=287:7></a> All has been done that is needed.<a name=287:8></a> His blood is available for the vilest, whoever he may be.<a name=287:9></a> Hence the gospel to the world says, "Whosoever will, let him come.<a name=287:10></a>" In this aspect we may say Christ died for all, gave Himself a ransom for all -- an <i>antilutron peri panton</i>, an adequate and available sacrifice for sin for whoever would come -- tasted death for every man.<a name=287:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But when I come to bearing sins, the language is uniformly different.<a name=287:12></a> He bore our sins, He bore the sins of many.<a name=287:13></a> "All" is carefully abstained from.<a name=287:14></a> I say carefully, because in Romans 5: 18, 19 the difference is carefully made.<a name=287:15></a> The first, our sins, is the language of faith, left open indeed to anyone who can use it; but used and to be used only by faith.<a name=287:16></a> The believing remnant of Israel may use it, including the blessing of the nations, for He died for that nation; Christians use it in faith, for all that have faith to use it.<a name=287:17></a> The second "many" restricts it from all, but generally has the force of the many; the <i>oi polloi</i>, as contrasted with a head or leaders, the mass in connection with them.<a name=287:18></a> Adam's <i>oi polloi</i> were in result all, but all as in connection with him; Christ's oi <i>polloi</i>, those connected with Him.<a name=287:19></a> But it will never be found in Scripture that Christ bore the sins of all.<a name=287:20></a> Had He done so, they never could be mentioned again, nor men judged according to their works.<a name=287:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That Christ died for all is, as we have seen, often said in Scripture.<a name=287:22></a> Hence I go with His death to the world as their ground and only ground of approach, with the love shewn in it.<a name=287:23></a> When a man believes, I can say, Now I have more to tell you: Christ has borne every one of your sins; they never can be mentioned again.<a name=287:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we look at the difference of Arminian and Calvinistic preaching, we shall see the bearing of this at once.<a name=287:25></a> The Arminians take up Christ's dying for all, and generally they connect the bearing of sins with it; and all is confusion as to the efficacy and effectualness of Christ's bearing our sins, for they deny any special work for His people.<a name=287:26></a> They say, If God loved all, He cannot love some particularly; and an uncertain salvation is the result, and man often exalted.<a name=287:27></a> Thus the scapegoat is practically set aside.<a name=287:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=288>[Page 288]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Calvinist holds Christ's bearing the sins of His people, so that they are effectually saved; but he sees nothing else.<a name=288:1></a> He will say, If Christ loved the church, and gave Himself for it, there can be no real love for anything else.<a name=288:2></a> Thus he denies Christ's dying for all, and the distinctive character of propitiation, and the blood on the mercy-seat.<a name=288:3></a> He sees nothing but substitution.<a name=288:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The truth is, Christ is said to love the church, never the world.<a name=288:5></a> That is a love of special relationship.<a name=288:6></a> God is never said to love the church, but the world.<a name=288:7></a> This is divine goodness, what is in the nature of God (not His purpose), and His glory is the real end of all.<a name=288:8></a> But I do not dwell on this, only pointing out the confusion of propitiation and substitution as necessarily making confusion in the gospel, enfeebling the address to the world, or weakening the security of the believer, and in every respect giving uncertainty to the announcement of the truth.<a name=288:9></a> I believe earnestness after souls, and preaching Christ with love to Him, will be blessed where there is little clearness, and is more important than great exactitude of statement.<a name=288:10></a> Still it is a comfort to the preacher to have it clear, even if not thinking about it at the moment; and, when building up afterwards, the solidness of the foundation is of the greatest moment.<a name=288:11></a>

		THE WAY OF HOLINESS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we pay a little attention to Scripture, we shall see that holiness, while based essentially upon being born of God, our having put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness (Ephesians 4), renewed in knowledge after the image of Him that created us, being made partakers of the divine nature -- holiness, while manifested here, is dependent on, and directly and characteristically associated with, the heavenly objects and hopes, revealed to us by the Holy Ghost, consequent on the glorifying of the Lord Jesus as Man.<a name=289:1></a> Obedient and dependent confidence, perhaps I should more justly say confiding dependence, characterise at all times the soul whose eyes have been opened in faith, the divine life in man.<a name=289:2></a> But when God was hidden within the veil, and even so known, as to His actual revelation of Himself on earth, the holiness was co-ordinate to the revelation made.<a name=289:3></a> Faith, doubtless, may have often looked above it all, and known that God was in heaven, and man upon earth; and prophetic truth might point men farther, and tell men that eye had not seen, nor ear heard, neither had entered into the heart of man, the things which God had prepared for them that love Him; but it could only tell them that man had not, nor had it entered into his heart, and the ordered revelation given of God presented a God revealed on earth, and holiness was referred to His house, and that house was down here; admitted, as it was, that heaven was His dwelling-place, and that the heaven of heavens could not contain Him.<a name=289:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Yet His name and revealed glory were down here in the tabernacle and in the temple, and everything, and all true consecration, was referred to that.<a name=289:5></a> There He dwelt with His people, His house was holy -- there were holy flesh, holy garments, a worldly sanctuary, an altar most holy, and holy vessels.<a name=289:6></a> They were to be holy, because He who dwelt amongst them was holy -- would allow no uncleanness in the camp.<a name=289:7></a> The vessels were holy, and the unclean could not draw near.<a name=289:8></a> Everything was consecrated to Him as dwelling there, and once a year an atonement made, and His tabernacle cleansed, because of the iniquity of the children of Israel, among whom He dwelt.<a name=289:9></a> Naturally, though further thought might, and did, break into faith, holiness practically referred to the revelation made of God and His dwelling-place, as revealed; relative holiness -- and all true holiness is relative -- relates to God as He has made Himself known.<a name=289:10></a>

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=290>[Page 290]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The abstract remained true, that holiness became His house for ever, but the measure and character of it referred as obligatory to the way and measure in which the necessary and divine object of it was revealed.<a name=290:1></a> But the Holy Ghost signified, by the veil, that the way into the holiest was not yet made manifest while the first tabernacle had its standing.<a name=290:2></a> A law was given by a mediator; but the people could not come nigh, even to the revelation given of God upon earth.<a name=290:3></a> A holy house, and holy vessels, and sanctified priests, surrounded God outside.<a name=290:4></a> A figure of Christ in one, for whom it was death if he did not go in with a due cloud of incense, marked that the way of man to God was not opened; and the revelation of God to man was not till the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, declared Him, and the rent veil shewed the open way, with boldness, into the holiest for sinners cleansed by the blood shed in rending it.<a name=290:5></a>

		I would, for a few moments, draw the attention of brethren in Christ to a point, as to which I think there has been a good deal of misapprehension in practice, and which, while the joy of known forgiveness seemed to make all plain for a time, has left souls subsequently in distress and difficulty, even when not doubting of their acceptance, though it has sometimes come to that.<a name=298:1></a> Forgiveness is not deliverance, and they have been a good deal confounded.<a name=298:2></a> It is a very common experience, when a person has found peace through the blood of Christ, that the pardoned and justified soul, filled with joy and gladness to find its sins gone, the conscience purged, the sense of divine goodness filling it, thinks that it has done with sin because it is at the time full of joy, and the Lord's goodness and favour; but thus is not deliverance.<a name=298:3></a>

		We have owned in our very profession of Christ that we were away from God in the flesh, but have taken our part in Christ's death as a Saviour, in order to be with God; and as He died to sin once, so we thus reckon ourselves dead to sin, and alive to God, in Him who is our life, in the power of the Spirit.<a name=300:1></a> The result is in Romans 8, where we enjoy the life in liberty, according to the power in which He lives, and as dead to the sin which was condemned in His death on the cross.<a name=300:2></a> We are in Him now.<a name=300:3></a> The manner of it is that the sin which held me captive, and distressed me, as a renewed person, was condemned in Him on the cross (verse 3), so that there is no condemnation by reason of it for me.<a name=300:4></a> But this was in His death, and it is as though I had been there, as He was there made sin for me, and thus the condemnation is past and finished.<a name=300:5></a> But then, as to the flesh, sin in the flesh, I died; nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.<a name=300:6></a> Thus for faith I am delivered from sin in the flesh, as having died in Christ, in that Christ has, who is my life.<a name=300:7></a> It is not resurrection with Him -- that carries us further -- but death in Him on the cross as to the old man and state, and He now at the right hand of God, my life.<a name=300:8></a> Such is the doctrine and effect.<a name=300:9></a> Christ, who died, my life, and I in Him, in the power of the Holy Ghost, and through that dead to sin altogether, He having thus died, and the sin in my flesh condemned there, but for faith I died to it, for I died in Him.<a name=300:10></a> The condemnation He took, but it was in death, so that I reckon myself dead to sin in His death, and He is now my life, Christ in me, the only thing I own, and that by the Holy Ghost, as consciousness and power.<a name=300:11></a>

		But when I speak of Christ my life, and Christ being in me, the body dead because of sin, its only fruit if alive in its own life, I do not speak of a work done wholly outside me, finished, and accepted of God, so that sin can be no more imputed; but of one which, though really and effectually done for me on one side, or it would be legal efforts, and the spirit of bondage again to fear, as it is in so many, is at the same time realised in me, so as to be experimental.<a name=301:7></a> If Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin.<a name=301:8></a> I reckon myself dead.<a name=301:9></a> In a word, experience comes in.<a name=301:10></a> Hence, while chapters 6 and 8 give me the ground of faith in what Christ has done, teaching me to reckon myself dead, and alive to God in Christ, because Christ has died, and has been raised from the dead, between this, so far as developed in chapter 6, and the enjoyed effect in chapter 8, we find introduced the painful experience of that from which we have to be delivered.<a name=301:11></a>

		The delivering work was done on the cross, so that our state, by faith in Christ, is dead to sin, and morally, as to the life this side the cross, in which He, sinless, had to be made it, wholly closed, and alive now wholly beyond it all, with nothing but God to live to; and this, not by our efforts, but by faith through grace; yet, as conviction of guilt goes before known forgiveness, so the experimental knowledge of self before deliverance.<a name=301:12></a> No effort clears the guilt; no effort effects the deliverance; but there is the knowledge of self, and that we cannot get free by improvement or victory, as there is the knowledge of the guilt which is pardoned; only here it is self-knowledge and present experience.<a name=301:13></a>

		Of this the law is ever the instrument; if we have learnt forgiveness already, the form is modified, takes the shape of hoping we have not deceived ourselves, and the like; but it is always a comparison of our state, and what God requires, and that is law; very useful for the discovery of our state, but bondage.<a name=302:1></a> I repeat, as it is important, wherever we reason from our state to what God's acceptance of us may be, that is, in principle, law just as the prodigal son between his conversion and meeting his father.<a name=302:2></a> It calls itself holiness, will insist that without holiness no man shall see the Lord, which is necessarily and eternally true, but mixes it with God's acceptance of us, connecting this and our state, so that it is really righteousness, not holiness, that the mind is occupied with: for in holiness we hate evil because it is unholy, not because we are out of divine favour by it; but, whatever shape it takes, it is always really law, a question of evil that makes us unacceptable to God.<a name=302:3></a>

		Now the doctrine is that we have died in Christ.<a name=302:4></a> The law supposes living, responsible men, as, of course, as children of Adam we are.<a name=302:5></a> The law has power over a man as long as he lives.<a name=302:6></a> Dead, it cannot deal with him as a present responsible person.<a name=302:7></a> I cannot accuse a dead man, as a present thing, of evil lusts and self-will.<a name=302:8></a> The apostle puts the case of the marriage relationship; death dissolves it, and leaves the person free; we have died under law, but so are dead to law, and now are married to another, a risen Christ, who is, as man, put in a wholly new place, after the question of sin is settled, and then gives the experience of the soul under the first husband, the law, not now as to guilt, but as to the power of sin dwelling in us.<a name=302:9></a> Here I learn that in me (it is not what I have done) dwells no good thing; the flesh is simply and always bad.<a name=302:10></a> Secondly; it is not myself, being born of God, for I hate it, it is not therefore I.<a name=302:11></a> This is often a great relief, though it be not deliverance; but thirdly, though it be not I, it is too strong for me: I am captive to it.<a name=302:12></a> All my efforts only prove this to me.<a name=302:13></a> As effort and conflict, I give it up as hopeless, and look for another to come in and deliver me.<a name=302:14></a> I have learned that I have no strength (not that I am guilty), and that is what I had to learn, the lesson God was teaching me; and when brought there I find it is all done.<a name=302:15></a> I am not in the flesh at all, the condemnation of the flesh which tormented me was accomplished on the cross, and I am in Him who is risen and is on high after all was done; and founded on this, I have life, and power, and liberty by the Holy Ghost, by which I am in Him who is risen and know it.<a name=302:16></a> The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death, and the sin in my flesh has been condemned in the cross, on which I died with Christ.<a name=302:17></a> I am not in the flesh; that, be it what it may, is not my standing before God, but in the Spirit, accepted in, and as Christ is, boldness for the day of judgment, because as He is, so are we in this world.<a name=302:18></a>

		The effects of this are of all importance in many ways.<a name=303:1></a> First, the soul is happy, has the Spirit of adoption, liberty in love before God.<a name=303:2></a> Secondly, the staff and strength of self is broken.<a name=303:3></a> There may be the truest purpose of heart and yet unsuspected and unbroken self, as when Moses killed the Egyptian.<a name=303:4></a> And an experienced Christian will soon see the difference.<a name=303:5></a> Many do mischief in the church through this.<a name=303:6></a> With self we have ever to contend, ever to judge it, but self-confidence is another thing, there is not then the waiting upon God which characterises the exercised soul which knows itself.<a name=303:7></a> Only I would add, we may find self-judgment, when not delivered, and only on the way to it, but then confidence in God will be wanting.<a name=303:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Further, the whole character of worship is affected.<a name=303:9></a> Where mere forgiveness is known, the ground of it is only deliverance from guilt and ruin; true, but a witness that our conversation is not in heaven, what we were as guilty sinners, rests still on the spirit.<a name=303:10></a> Now I believe that the wonders of the grace that redeemed us, and the value of Christ's precious blood, will be more felt in heaven than here, but we shall enjoy what is actually there, not be thinking habitually of where we were.<a name=303:11></a> But our conversation is in heaven now, our living relationships for the new man; we belong to it, are in Christ; our affections are to be set upon things above, developed in connection with what is there; the Holy Ghost gives us to know the things freely given to us of God.<a name=303:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And this will affect every part of the Christian's inward life, and his more outward life and service.<a name=304:1></a> Hundreds will be found who have found peace in forgiveness, but not deliverance as taught in the word.<a name=304:2></a> I add, as it is sometimes a difficulty, that the two parts of Romans must be read not as in necessary sequence, as to their contents.<a name=304:3></a> The first, chapters 1-5: 11, treats of personal guilt, and grace that meets it.<a name=304:4></a> The second, chapter 5:12 to chapter 8: 39, our state through Adam's sin, and the remedy for that.<a name=304:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would add, as a further help, that if there is heart indifference, or even sloth, it is not surprising that we do not find deliverance, or if there is a walk contrary to the mind of the Spirit, or what a Christian should seek, deliverance by the power of the Spirit is hardly to be looked for.<a name=304:6></a> But further, if a person who has found deliverance is so walking, though the soul may not get back into uncertainty as to its standing, or return into a state of Romans 7, yet the Spirit which is the power of this new state, being ever grieved, and so communion with the Father and the Son lost, though not the knowledge of the relationship, the affections not being filled with what belongs to this new position -- all is confusion and obscurity in the soul.<a name=304:7></a> One is a child, but where is my father?<a name=304:8></a> I belong to heaven, but where for me is the heaven I belong to?<a name=304:9></a> What I know of both serves but to make me sensible of my actual loss of them.<a name=304:10></a> Hence, though it is not subjectively a question whether I am a son, it is objectively a failure of what a son enjoys, so that darkness is on the spirit.<a name=304:11></a> I hardly know whether I can call myself so, though I do not doubt it.<a name=304:12></a> For this the only remedy is humiliation, and drawing near to the Lord, and giving up the hindering idol.<a name=304:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In dealing with the souls of others, the first point is to discern whether the soul is really delivered, or if it be negligence when it has understood its position in Christ before God.<a name=304:14></a> This is a matter of spiritual discernment.<a name=304:15></a> Where there is a legal and self-judging temperament, it is not always so easy.<a name=304:16></a> And we must remember that there are many true souls who do cry, Abba Father, with God, but through bad teaching are afraid to take their place in acceptance; these we must seek to make clear by the word.<a name=304:17></a>

		When once we descend into any connection with the old, it is either sin in the flesh, or it is worse than deadly to die to it.<a name=309:1></a> Another thing has to be remarked, which, in connection with these new views, is of all importance, and shews the falseness of them where they are new.<a name=309:2></a> This state of abstraction to divine things is always connected with our being in Christ, not Christ in us, and hence with sovereign grace which has put us there, and is true of every Christian as to his real standing.<a name=309:3></a> Thus, in Ephesians <i>2</i>, we are sitting in heavenly places in Christ, and it is to usward who believe.<a name=309:4></a> So, in 2 Corinthians 5, If any man be in Christ Jesus.<a name=309:5></a> Now in Colossians, which is their great battle-horse, it is Christ in us, and we are not sitting in heavenly places at all; it is a hope laid up for us in heaven, and all in conformity to this: Christ sits there at the right hand of God, and we are called to have our affections there.<a name=309:6></a>

		Hence His Spirit is not introduced, and, being looked at as still on the road, we read: "If ye continue in the faith, grounded and settled, and be not moved away," and that in view of being presented holy and unblameable and unreprovable in His sight, as a future thing.<a name=309:7></a> I do not doubt the faithfulness of that blessed One to keep us, but in Colossians we have to be kept in the midst of evil and temptation.<a name=309:8></a> In Ephesians we have no "ifs," but are actually sitting, not yet with, but in, Christ in heavenly places.<a name=309:9></a> Hence Christian life in us down here is developed in Colossians as nowhere else in Scripture.<a name=309:10></a> And remark that our being in Christ is sovereign grace, not a process, however blessed, in us.<a name=309:11></a> You have no development in Ephesians, but a place and state we are to shew out, in contrast with an old and sinful thing.<a name=309:12></a>

		But further, when Christ in us is treated of, and death as connected with what we are down here, is spoken of, it is sin, not nature, we have done with.<a name=309:13></a> In a new creation we have done with nature in the first Adam, have put it off, are renewed in knowledge after the image of Him that created us.<a name=309:14></a> But where, as in Colossians, it is Christ in us, it is death to sin and the world, not to nature.<a name=309:15></a> And in Romans 8, "If Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin," not because of nature.<a name=309:16></a> I am dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world.<a name=309:17></a> Indeed it is remarkable in Colossians how the heavenly state is passed over as a state, though suited affections are looked for down here; but it is Christ in us, the hope of glory; or, we appearing with Him when He appears, though in a subjective way affections ordered by it are looked for; and this is because death and resurrection with Christ are treated of, not a new creation.<a name=309:18></a> For even in that which goes farthest (chapter 2: 13), and draws nearest to Ephesian truth, we have no introduction into heavenly places, unless in the new creation.<a name=309:19></a> And in the new creation death to the old man is never spoken of.<a name=309:20></a> The whole system is ignorance of Scripture, not new truth.<a name=309:21></a>

		I might add that death to sin and resurrection are connected with testimony and service and spiritual state subjectively down here as to the effect, not with communion in heaven, as far as I am aware.<a name=310:1></a> As regards nature, as distinct from sinful nature, instead of having done with it, where it is taken into account -- and if I die, it is taken into account -- it is, in positive opposition to this teaching, carefully guarded and owned.<a name=310:2></a> Being without natural affection is one of the signs of the last days, the worst state of evil.<a name=310:3></a> As created of God, it is carefully owned.<a name=310:4></a> Relations which in nature still subsist were established before the fall.<a name=310:5></a> Everything in man is spoiled by that fall; but when nature is separated from its fallen condition, in which it is called flesh -- and this separation is the essence of this doctrine -- it is carefully maintained, not died to; sin is -- at least the Christian is reckoned to be dead to it, not nature.<a name=310:6></a> So in speaking of divorce -- that was the effect of sin; but in the beginning it was not so, says the Lord: "God made them male and female," and maintains, and insists on maintaining, what God created -- nature.<a name=310:7></a> So the apostle: forbidding to marry was a doctrine of demons, though, if a man could give himself up to Christ's work, it was better.<a name=310:8></a>

		When the Lord looked upon the young man, He loved him; but as to his moral state, sin, the lust of money, possessed the young man's heart, and he preferred it to Christ, and left Him.<a name=310:9></a> In service, till His hour was come, the Lord had only for His mother, "Woman, what have I to do with thee?<a name=310:10></a>" But when that was over, in that most solemn moment, He could say, Mother, behold thy son; Son, behold thy mother.<a name=310:11></a> It has been even said that the Lord, when returning from the temple at twelve years old, made Himself in grace, in going back with Joseph and His mother, subject to the bondage of corruption!<a name=310:12></a> But this makes the law sin, for the law commands it.<a name=310:13></a> In competition with Christ, all yields.<a name=310:14></a> He created these relationships, and is Lord in and above them; but while a risen state and heavenly things, where they have no place at all, are recognised, they, as formed by God, are fully recognised; and there is no dying to nature spoken of in Scripture.<a name=310:15></a> The soul may be in a certain sense out of it, not think of it, as in a fresh sphere into which it has entered; but if one has to say to it, he is bound to own it as of God, though He be paramount to it; and, if it be set in opposition to Him, it is then sin.<a name=310:16></a>

		Another grave error, ruinous to the truth, is connected with the system: our being in Christ and Christ in us being confounded -- truths which go together, but are quite distinct in their nature and bearing.<a name=311:8></a> Divine righteousness loses its whole nature, place, and bearing.<a name=311:9></a> Sovereign grace has placed us in Christ before God, and Christ is made unto us righteousness; we are made the righteousness of God in Him.<a name=311:10></a> He having perfectly glorified God, when He was made sin for us, and bore our sins, God's righteousness has set Him as Man at the right hand of the Majesty in the heavens; and part of the righteousness of God is that He should see the fruit of the travail of His soul, and be satisfied: He must have us, therefore, in the glory with Him, and like Himself.<a name=311:11></a> Wondrous counsels of God!<a name=311:12></a> Wondrous efficacy of the work of Christ!<a name=311:13></a> Yet a necessary part of His glory.<a name=311:14></a> What would a Redeemer be without redeemed?<a name=311:15></a> Yet to us all grace, the exceeding riches of grace.<a name=311:16></a> But it is no work in us which is the basis of this, but Christ's work for us, when absolutely alone and made sin for us.<a name=311:17></a> He made Him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him -- not He in us.<a name=311:18></a> It is quite true that we must have the life to have the righteousness; but that does not make of the life in us our divine righteousness as they do.<a name=311:19></a> They make of our being in Christ and Christ in us, not that Christ is both our righteousness and life in power in us, but that thus that life is our divine righteousness, we are it in the power of that life, the fulness being in us; and on the other hand, that, as Christ who is our life is in God, our life is in God.<a name=311:20></a> The righteousness of God, which, Scripture says, we are made in Him, they make out He is made in us: it is our state, not God's righteousness.<a name=311:21></a>

		This is a result obtained by dying to nature, an experimental condition.<a name=313:1></a> In the passage, it is Christ made sin which is the ground of it; in this system, it is our having died to nature, and so having actual righteousness (in express contrast with justification by faith) according to the power of righteousness in glory.<a name=313:2></a> And what is the effect?<a name=313:3></a> The simple sovereign grace which took us when dead in sins, and set us in heavenly places in Christ, is practically lost, and those under the influence of the system filled with what they call Christ in them -- but really as is ever the case, with themselves -- and Christ in Himself is practically lost to them.<a name=313:4></a> It is, we are told, "escaped from the scene below, to look around in that effulgent light with not a mist of earth to intervene.<a name=313:5></a>" We are to suppose this is the experience of the writer.<a name=313:6></a> Nor have I found one who came under the system who was not occupied with himself.<a name=313:7></a> But John, in writing of fathers in Christ, has nothing to say of them but "They have known him that is from the beginning.<a name=313:8></a>"

		I add a few words, that my opposition to what I consider error may not be mistaken for opposition to the blessed truth that error clouds.<a name=315:1></a> I hold the cross to be the end of man's moral history -- "now is the judgment of this world" -- now "they have both seen and hated both me and my Father"; and that we are livingly associated with a glorified Christ through the Holy Ghost, and that by His power we enter into the enjoyment of that we are called to.<a name=315:2></a> Our conversation is in heaven.<a name=315:3></a> Not only that we are forgiven and justified as regards our human responsibility in connection with the first Adam, but introduced in spirit into all that Christ is entered into, and are associated with His place as Man and Son, as we were with Adam's.<a name=315:4></a> It is the difference of what Scripture calls the perfect (full-grown) Christian.<a name=315:5></a> It is because I more and more believe, and I hope more and more realise, this blessed place, that I would clear it of the errors with which imagination and man's mind have surrounded it.<a name=315:6></a> I would more than ever earnestly press our place being Christ's place.<a name=315:7></a> Only that Scripture carefully guards the individual glory of His Person.<a name=315:8></a> Still, He that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one, for which cause He is not ashamed to call us brethren.<a name=315:9></a>

		The state of heart has more to do than exegesis with the understanding of this passage.<a name=317:1></a> Yet important doctrines, or rather facts and truths relative to Christ, are connected with these remarkable verses.<a name=317:2></a> I shall try to bring out the position in which the ever blessed Saviour is found here, although the appreciation of the bearing of these verses depends, after all, on the spirituality of the heart.<a name=317:3></a> It will be understood that doctrines about Christ are connected with them, when one knows that verses 43 and 44 have been omitted by more than one manuscript, evidently because according to the view taken by the copyists they made Christ too much a man.<a name=317:4></a> Now it is this which gives to these verses their true value: Christ, in the Gospel of Luke, is essentially man.<a name=317:5></a> We there find Him in prayer much oftener than in the other Gospels.<a name=317:6></a> Thus, after His baptism by John, it was whilst He prayed that heaven was opened upon Him; it was whilst He prayed that He was transfigured; chapter 9.<a name=317:7></a> So also He had passed all the night in prayer before choosing the twelve disciples; chapter 6: 12.<a name=317:8></a> All this is exceedingly interesting, yea, of profound interest for the heart.<a name=317:9></a>

		But other elements present themselves in the consideration of these verses which are before us.<a name=317:10></a> An immense change was taking place at this time in the position of the Saviour.<a name=317:11></a> Until then He had, by His divine power, provided for all the wants of His disciples, entirely disowned as He was, and in appearance dependent on the kindness of a few women (for it was their particular privilege thus to devote themselves to Him), or of other persons, for His daily bread -- if needed, a fish.<a name=317:12></a> They brought Him exactly what was necessary to supply His wants.<a name=317:13></a> And when He sends His disciples to preach in the cities of the glorious land, He knows how to turn the hearts so that they lacked nothing.<a name=317:14></a> But He was to be rejected.<a name=317:15></a> The things concerning Him were to receive their divine and wonderful solution, and to be accomplished according to the depth of the counsels of God.<a name=317:16></a> He was going, not to shelter His disciples from every evil, but not to shelter Himself, and to be exposed to the outrages of those who said, "He saved others; himself he cannot save.<a name=317:17></a> If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.<a name=317:18></a>" Christ was not yet drinking the cup of wrath.<a name=317:19></a> This was accomplished on the cross; it was there, that which He suffered from the hand of God, supreme and expiatory in its nature.<a name=317:20></a> But the moment was come which He Himself described by these words: "This is now your hour, and the power of darkness.<a name=317:21></a>" The hour of temptation, not of wrath but of temptation, when the Saviour must have thought at the same time of the terrible cup that was before Him.<a name=317:22></a> The enemy tried to overwhelm Him by the circumstances, before which human nature, as such, would shrink; and in view of the forsaking of God amidst these circumstances.<a name=317:23></a> The Saviour entered at this moment into the trial; but He entered into it perfect in every way, receiving the cup in obedience from the hand of His Father.<a name=317:24></a> As to the circumstances, and as to that which weighed upon His soul, Satan and the men under his power were everything: as to the state of His soul, they were nothing; His Father was everything.<a name=317:25></a> This is one of the most perfect and profound instructions for all our troubles.<a name=317:26></a>

		THE GOSPEL AND THE CHURCH ACCORDING TO SCRIPTURE: BEING A REVIEW OF "CHURCH DOCTRINE, BIBLE TRUTH," BY THE REVEREND M. S. SADLER
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are many things I accept in this book, truths that the evangelical world have, from circumstances, lost, or which have been thrown by them into the background.<a name=324:1></a> I shall refer to some of the chief ones here.<a name=324:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, I believe the Person of the Lord has lost the place -- at least in revival preaching -- it ought to have, and it makes that preaching, though I doubt not often blessed, seriously defective.<a name=324:3></a> Salvation by the love of God to sinners -- surely a blessed truth -- is preached rather than Christ.<a name=324:4></a> This I have long felt and remarked.<a name=324:5></a> Still, Mr.<a name=324:6></a> Sadler is all wrong about it, as I shall shew.<a name=324:7></a> He leaves out the salvation -- rather a serious defect, and certainly unscriptural.<a name=324:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Secondly, I have no doubt that worship, with the Lord's supper as the great and characterising centre of it, and not preaching, is the great object of Christians assembling themselves together.<a name=324:9></a> Preaching and teaching is the work of individuals, and goes on <i>pari passu</i>.<a name=324:10></a> But it is not the assembly's (and church simply means assembly) part to teach or set forth the gospel, but the apostle's, evangelist's, or whoever is able.<a name=324:11></a> The assembly is taught, and confesses the truth.<a name=324:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thirdly, going to heaven -- an unscriptural expression -- has displaced in the evangelical mind the coming of the Lord and resurrection.<a name=324:13></a> But, for all that, Mr.<a name=324:14></a> Sadler has wholly missed the mark here too.<a name=324:15></a> He has read the Scriptures enough to see the defects of the evangelical school, but has not the faith of God's elect so as to know the truth either as to the gospel or the church.<a name=324:16></a> Moreover, as to church history, his representation of it -- I do not mean intentionally -- is far away from the truth.<a name=324:17></a> He must have read it with a very prejudiced eye.<a name=324:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I must first take notice of his statements as to the Gospels in a few words.<a name=324:19></a> Here, as to what is evidently vital, his statements are quite unfounded.<a name=324:20></a> "Gospel" is not applied, as he states, exclusively to the announcement of certain events occurring at a particular time in the history of the world.<a name=324:21></a> "Gospel" means simply glad tidings, whatsoever they are.<a name=324:22></a> The verb is applied to the good news Timothy brought of the Thessalonians to Paul; 1 Thessalonians 3: 6.<a name=324:23></a> As to Mark, the incarnation and birth of Christ form no part of what he calls the Gospels.<a name=324:24></a> Further, the gospel of the kingdom<a href="#324:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> being at hand, which above all is called the gospel in the four Gospels, is not included in Mr.<a name=324:25></a> Sadler's list, and could not subsist, as chiefly there spoken of, till all the events which are were past.<a name=324:26></a> All that is peculiarly Paul's gospel (though surely recognising all) is outside all the events contained in Mr.<a name=324:27></a> Sadler's list.<a name=324:28></a> It did not begin, in fact and in doctrine, till Jesus was glorified.<a name=324:29></a>

		Paul calls it the gospel of the glory, and this is vital to his mission, and that which connected it with the assembly or church, which he alone speaks of in his teaching as formed on earth, and speaks of as a distinct and separate ministry; and he is specially the apostle of the Gentiles.<a name=325:1></a> Nor even does what is said by Mr.<a name=325:2></a> Sadler as to the beginning of Romans give any true idea of Paul's statement as a whole there, nor even of that part of it which Mr.<a name=325:3></a> Sadler does refer to.<a name=325:4></a> I think it of great moment to note, as I have often done in public and in private, how the apostle puts Christ personally forward here as the great subject of the gospel; but Mr.<a name=325:5></a> Sadler's use of this fact is partial and false.<a name=325:6></a> As "made of the seed of David according to the flesh," we have nothing to do with Christ.<a name=325:7></a> He was "a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made to the fathers": the Gentiles stand on other ground.<a name=325:8></a> They "glorify God for his mercy," having no promises, though prophecies spoke of them.<a name=325:9></a> As Son of David Christ was not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, and could not take the children's bread and cast it to dogs.<a name=325:10></a> He declares, "I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.<a name=325:11></a>" "Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone.<a name=325:12></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		As God manifest in the flesh, He is the object of infinite delight to the believing soul -- its food, as the bread come down from heaven; and when we have found peace through the divine commentaries of the apostle on the value of His work, the soul returns to the Gospels to feed on the bread come down from heaven.<a name=325:13></a> But even as to this, though souls may be drawn by the adorable grace manifested in His life, yet, till they eat His flesh and drink His blood, they have no life in them to feed on Him as bread come down from heaven.<a name=325:14></a> But, to shew how little foundation there is for this statement of Mr.<a name=325:15></a> Sadler, the meaning he ascribes to "gospel" is not the meaning of it in Mark.<a name=325:16></a> In the same chapter as that to which Mr.<a name=325:17></a> Sadler refers, the evangelist says, "Jesus came into Galilee preaching the gospel [the glad tidings] of the kingdom, and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand.<a name=325:18></a>" The preaching is the same; Matthew 4: 12, 23.<a name=325:19></a> Such was the constant tenor of Christ's preaching.<a name=325:20></a>

		The twelve, consequently, were sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.<a name=326:1></a> So, in Luke 4: 18-21, He preached the fulfilment of promise, not His death for our sins, or resurrection; and so, verse 43, He preaches the kingdom of God.<a name=326:2></a> In chapter 9: 2 He sends them to preach the kingdom of God.<a name=326:3></a> As regards His death and resurrection, we read that, from the time immediately preceding the transfiguration, He forbade them strongly to say any more that He was the Christ; and so far from preaching His death, or that being the gospel then set forth, we find that, when He told them of it prophetically, they could not bear to hear of it.<a name=326:4></a> Yet His death and resurrection, now they are accomplished, are become the great subject of testimony (1 Corinthians 15: 3, 4), and that for our sins.<a name=326:5></a> Christ according to the flesh (that is, as presented to the Jews as their Messiah, come according to promise) Paul knew no more; 2 Corinthians 5: 16.<a name=326:6></a> See Matthew 16: 20, 21; Mark 9: 31; Luke 9: 21, 22.<a name=326:7></a>

		I turn to what is said of it in Romans.<a name=326:8></a> We have seen that Paul begins with the double character of Christ, known as Son of David according to the flesh, and Son of God by resurrection.<a name=326:9></a> But Mr.<a name=326:10></a> Sadler leaves out that Paul was not ashamed of the gospel, or that it was the power of God to salvation, because the righteousness of God was revealed in it (Romans 1: 16, 17); and that he largely sets forth (chapter 3: 19-26) how Christ was set forth a propitiation through faith in His blood -- how, further (chapter 4: 25), He was delivered for our offences, and raised again for our justification.<a name=326:11></a> I believe the gospel will have power in the measure in which it is stated as facts, and I bless God that it comes in the shape of facts, because the poorest can understand it.<a name=326:12></a> But what it is for us is spoken of.<a name=326:13></a> God commends His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.<a name=326:14></a> The shepherd seeks the sheep, the woman the piece of money, the father has his joy in recovering the prodigal.<a name=326:15></a>

		It is not merely objective facts concerning Christ, but God's disposition towards us as displayed in them, not merely that Christ was raised but raised for our justification; not merely that God's Son came, but that God so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son that whosoever believeth on Him should not perish but have eternal life.<a name=327:1></a> It is not exclusively applied to the announcement of certain events; it is God's dealing with us revealed in them, and our conscience and heart directly dealt with by it.<a name=327:2></a> God was in Christ.<a name=327:3></a> Yet this is not the way the ministry of the gospel is put, but "God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them.<a name=327:4></a>" This was Paul's estimate of the gospel history, and then of his own gospel when Christ had died, that, as though God did beseech by us, we beseech in Christ's stead, be reconciled to God.<a name=327:5></a> In the passage quoted by Mr.<a name=327:6></a> Sadler from 1 Corinthians 15, it is not that Christ died, "a certain event occurring," but Christ died for our sins; the purpose and grace of God to us as sinners is stated.<a name=327:7></a>

		I might quote other passages; but the truth is that all John's writings are strictly individual.<a name=337:18></a> The church is never introduced as a truth in them at all -- not even in chapter 17, which seems most like it.<a name=337:19></a> It does not speak of the assembly or church, but of the unitedness of the individuals in grace.<a name=337:20></a> There is indeed a threefold unity, of the eleven disciples, of those believing through their word, and of all Christians in glory.<a name=337:21></a> It may perhaps surprise some, that in the Epistles the church is never spoken of as a body formed on earth by any besides Paul.<a name=337:22></a>

		It is the same story with the jailor at Philippi, "Believe on the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house" -- no word of joining a body to be saved.<a name=338:1></a> I do not doubt a moment that they became part of the assembly of God, but not a word is said of it connected with salvation.<a name=338:2></a> So Paul preached "Jesus and the resurrection" at Athens, and "kept back nothing that was profitable" at Ephesus, preaching "repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ": individual dealing with souls, and nothing of the assembly or church, and that in the very place where he afterwards unfolded it.<a name=338:3></a>

		In 1 Corinthians 12: 13 we read, "By one Spirit we are all baptised into one body.<a name=341:1></a>" That this is the Holy Ghost, and not baptism by water, is as clear as words can make it.<a name=341:2></a> The apostle is speaking of spiritual manifestations -- gifts given by the Holy Ghost: "All these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.<a name=341:3></a> For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.<a name=341:4></a> For by one Spirit are we all baptised into one body.<a name=341:5></a>" One has only to read the chapter to see, with unquestionable evidence, that the apostle is speaking of the Holy Spirit Himself.<a name=341:6></a>

		I turn now to being born of God in baptism.<a name=342:9></a> This is equally unwarranted by Scripture -- nay, formally contradicted.<a name=342:10></a> "Of his own will," says James, "begat he us by the word of truth"; and Peter, "Being born again, not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible, by the word of God which liveth and abideth for ever," 1 Peter 1: 23.<a name=342:11></a> Paul tells us, "In Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel" (1 Corinthians 4: 15), and he was not sent to baptise -- strange, if men were born of God by it.<a name=342:12></a> He tells the Thessalonians God had chosen them to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth, whereunto He called them by his gospel; and the Lord declares, "Ye are clean through the word which I have spoken to you.<a name=342:13></a>" I have quoted positive passages.<a name=342:14></a> He who keeps to the word will find it confirmed in every page.<a name=342:15></a>

		This leads us at once to see what being born of water means; it is purifying from evil, sanctifying through the truth; and the Father's word is truth, that by which we are positively told by James we are begotten, born again according to Peter, who distinctly says, "Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit.<a name=343:13></a>" "Ye are clean," says the Lord Himself, "through the word which I have spoken unto you"; so Paul, "that he might sanctify and cleanse it, by the washing of water by the word.<a name=343:14></a>" There are two things, and, to set Mr.<a name=343:15></a> Sadler quite at ease, at the same time communication of a new life or nature.<a name=343:16></a> "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit," and the purifying the soul by obeying the truth, for this birth is by the word, the incorruptible seed of God.<a name=343:17></a> The whole tenor of the Lord's statement contradicts the "church" doctrine.<a name=343:18></a> "The wind bloweth where it listeth.<a name=343:19></a> So is every one that is born of the Spirit.<a name=343:20></a>" Whereas it is tied in that system to a formal rite, which all are bound by the system to carry out universally.<a name=343:21></a> Besides, it is the way of seeing the kingdom, as well as entering it, with the solemn statement of "Verily, verily.<a name=343:22></a>" Does baptism make people see it?<a name=343:23></a> Not now, for the child at any rate, to whom that system habitually applies it, does not see it at all; not the kingdom of glory, for they admit that many baptised never see that at all.<a name=343:24></a>

		I conclude then (that, while baptism was the public and outward admission into the Christian assembly, as formed on earth, and so to its privileges here, and so formally to the remission of sins, which was found there, and hence, when sins were already committed, their remission received administratively, and men passed into a new place and position, being accounted to have wholly left in Christ's death, to which men were baptised, their old standing), it is not being born again at all according to John 3, it has nothing good or bad to do with being a member of Christ's body, nor was it any way receiving the Holy Ghost, which is always carefully distinguished from it.<a name=350:21></a> It is not receiving life, not being made a member of Christ's body, not receiving the Holy Ghost.<a name=350:22></a> The whole theory is antiscriptural as to the meaning and import of baptism, as well as to any fancied actual efficacy.<a name=350:23></a>

		I now turn to the scriptural view of the church or assembly of God.<a name=351:1></a> It is formed, we have seen, by the descent of the Holy Ghost.<a name=351:2></a> The Holy Spirit is given to believers as a seal on God's part of their faith, by reason of their being cleansed by the blood of Christ.<a name=351:3></a> They are sealed to the day of redemption.<a name=351:4></a> The effect of this in the individual, though full of blessing, and as important as the others of which we shall speak, is not our subject now.<a name=351:5></a> But the result, as stated in Scripture, as to the assembly, is that it is the body of Christ, each individual who is thus sealed being united to Christ the Head, and a member individually of His body; all thus sealed constituting His body.<a name=351:6></a> This, though it will be perfected as a whole in glory, is constituted on earth; for the Holy Ghost has come down here consequent on the Head being a Man exalted to the right hand of God.<a name=351:7></a> This may be seen in Ephesians 1: 19-23, as it is in the counsels of God: and in 1 Corinthians 12 as in fact down here.<a name=351:8></a>

		No true Christian doubts the divinity of the blessed Lord, but, solemn as was the institution of the Lord's supper, every word He spoke, and every act He did, was the expression of the same divine Person, so that the attempt to make anything especially mysterious on this account, in the Lord's supper, is utterly groundless; and, indeed, when He says, "in remembrance of Me," it is much more of Him viewed as man, conversant with them on earth, than as to His divine nature.<a name=359:10></a> "Remember Me" suits His presence and love down here; and if we add His death, it is certain that, though the whole value of His divinity is attached to His death, and only as a divine Person could He have done it, yet He died as man, not as to His divine nature.<a name=359:11></a> He was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death.<a name=359:12></a> And whilst holding fast the full deity of the blessed Lord as a very foundation of Christianity, we must not forget there is one Mediator between God and man, the Man Christ Jesus.<a name=359:13></a> His Person was no more mysterious in the Lord's supper, though the occasion was more solemn, than at any other time.<a name=359:14></a> If we speak of circumstances as especially mysterious, it was when a babe lying in the manger.<a name=359:15></a> But in truth it was always the same.<a name=359:16></a>

Chapter 5 is the life-giving Son; chapter 6 the incarnate and dying Redeemer -- our food while He is absent; chapter 7 the Holy Ghost given instead of the feast of tabernacles, where He will shew Himself to the world, which He could not keep then. I add, chapter 8, His word rejected; chapter 9, His work. In chapter 10 He will have His sheep in spite of them, and other sheep too. Chapters 11, 12 are God's recognition of Him as Son of God, Son of David, Son of man, which introduces His death, besides Mary in Bethany, a remnant who in a measure entered into it. From chapter 13 He is looked at as going up on high, but we have no suffering Christ led as a sheep to the slaughter; no sorrows in Gethsemane, but power and giving Himself freely up; no sorrows on the cross, but giving up His own spirit to the Father, when the time was come.

		To all Mr.<a name=374:1></a> Sadler says about the effect of administering I have already spoken; the administering itself, we have seen, is an invention, as appointing others to administer it.<a name=374:2></a> Hebrews 6: 1-4 is in contrast with spiritual Christianity.<a name=374:3></a> Baptisms are washings; laying on of hands is not spoken of ordination, as far as appears.<a name=374:4></a> The things are Jewish knowledge of Christ, and ways, as contrasted with the Christianity brought by the Holy Ghost.<a name=374:5></a> Laying on of hands was used for everything, sacrifices, healing, etc.<a name=374:6></a> The deacons had hands laid on them as apostolic sanction; I have little doubt the elders too, but Scripture carefully avoids saying so.<a name=374:7></a> Acts 13: 2 was commending to the Lord, and nothing else (chapter 14: 26); and was repeated on a second journey (chapter 15: 40); and, if anything else, was the ordination of an apostle by laymen, a singular proceeding, if giving a commission and authority be in question.<a name=374:8></a> The apostles, and the apostles only, could give the Holy Ghost by it.<a name=374:9></a> On the one hand the Holy Ghost distributed to every man severally as He would (1 Corinthians 12); and on the other, as to permanent ministry, the Lord gave, as ascended up on high, and as every one received the gift, he was to minister the same, as coming directly from God.<a name=374:10></a> Not a word of ordination in any case of ministry.<a name=374:11></a>
