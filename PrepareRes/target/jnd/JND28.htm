		NOTES ON THE EPISTLE TO THE HEBREWS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Epistle to the Hebrews presents to us the continuation of the testimony, by Christ Himself, of the Old Testament prophets.<a name=1:1></a> At the same time, this epistle unfolds the glory of Christ according to the testimony which these prophets have attributed to the Person of Christ the Messiah.<a name=1:2></a> He, Son of God and Son of man, came down here as an Apostle, bringing to us the divine truths; then returned to God from whom He has received the mediatorial office of Priest, waiting for the moment when He shall come in the governmental glory of Messiah.<a name=1:3></a> To this present glory of Jesus as High Priest in the heavenlies is conjoined a change of great importance in the operations or actings of God.<a name=1:4></a> A heavenly call takes the place of the earthly Jewish dispensation.<a name=1:5></a> This change of dispensation is one of the principal features of the book.<a name=1:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this epistle Israel is acknowledged of God as a people, but is only recognised as such as seen in the remnant.<a name=1:7></a> Accordingly this remnant is not separated from the whole of the people, as the church is, but presents itself under the figure described in the emblem of the olive tree (Romans 11), forming the branches upheld there by God.<a name=1:8></a> It crosses the period of Christianity, partaking of the blessed promises with the Gentiles who are also admitted on the olive tree during that time.<a name=1:9></a> We are put, we Gentiles, by the doctrine of Romans 11 into the place given to the believer in the Epistle to the Hebrews.<a name=1:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The church is not at all in question in this epistle, unless in chapter 12, where only it is named amongst those gathered by God for glory.<a name=1:11></a> The church is a heavenly body formed outside the arrangements of God in the ways of His government on earth.<a name=1:12></a> It is not a continuation of anything that preceded down here.<a name=1:13></a> Amongst the blessed families of God it is the one nearest to Himself.<a name=1:14></a> The remnant of Israel, alive during the period of the gospel, belongs to it; it partakes of the nature of the new man (Ephesians 2), in which it ceases to keep its distinctive character of remnant of Israel.<a name=1:15></a> But the doctrine of the Epistle of the Hebrews gives it that character, and this gives a double place to this class of saved ones, namely, the one of remnant of Israel on the earth, and the other of members of the church united to Christ in heaven.<a name=1:16></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		By the fact of a heavenly call resulting from the setting up of a new dispensation, confided to the Messiah in the heavenlies, the Epistle to the Hebrews pours upon the remnant a blessing which is also heavenly.<a name=2:1></a> And besides this blessing adapting itself to the purposes of God towards His people Israel, the epistle unfolds to us the privileges of the second covenant, which can already be realised under the present state of things, although in truth the covenant may only receive its accomplishment in the future.<a name=2:2></a> What is also remarkable is to find some expressions speaking of a blessing which could have a fulfilment only after the rapture of the church.<a name=2:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is no mediator for the church; it is seen in Christ and perfect; but the saints, seen as individuals, receive succour from the Mediator: this shews that in them there may be weakness or failure.<a name=2:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us remark also that the Holy Spirit, in putting under the eyes of the Hebrews these numerous developments concerning the change of dispensation, purposes by it to detach the remnant from the first covenant, in order to bind it in heaven to a heavenly Christ.<a name=2:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapters 1 and 2 unfold those glories of Messiah which pertain to His apostleship.<a name=2:6></a> It is, although a new feature, joined in chapter 2 to the humiliation of Christ.<a name=2:7></a> The Prince of salvation, for the benefit of the children of God He is bringing to glory, has borne the suffering of death and passed through afflictions.<a name=2:8></a> By this He is made bearer of the qualities necessary to priesthood.<a name=2:9></a> Accordingly in these two chapters are laid the foundations of His apostleship and also of His priesthood: of His apostleship in that He as God came Himself to bring the word to men; of His priesthood in that He as man passed through the experiences of the God-fearing man.<a name=2:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		CHAPTER 1
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verses 1, 2.<a name=2:11></a> "God spake to us in his Son," not in the Son as instrument of His word, but Himself, God the Son, by the prophets, but in [the] Son.<a name=2:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"In these last days.<a name=2:13></a>" At the end of the prophetical period God Himself spake to us: His testimony follows that of the prophets, but His is necessarily superior to theirs.<a name=2:14></a> As to "the worlds," the Greek word in the Epistle to the Hebrews is used in a general sense to indicate all that is in existence: it is used in the plural again in chapter 11: 3.<a name=2:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=3>[Page 3]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 3.<a name=3:1></a> "The exact expression of his substance"; Christ, "the image" of the invisible God.<a name=3:2></a> He has revealed down here by His presence the God who dwells in inaccessible light.<a name=3:3></a> All His acts did shew that He was God.<a name=3:4></a> He shewed His grace when He pronounced the forgiveness of a sinner, and His kindness when He took little children in His arms, etc.<a name=3:5></a> "Having made by himself the purification of sins.<a name=3:6></a>" The purification of our sins is here attached to the divine title of Jesus; it is part of His divine glory as much as the creation and preservation of all things.<a name=3:7></a> The title is the same also when it is mentioned a little further on: "He sat down.<a name=3:8></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verses 4-14.<a name=3:9></a> The Son, who brought us the word, is put in contrast with the angels by whom God dictated His law.<a name=3:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 4.<a name=3:11></a> "Having become" or having taken a place.<a name=3:12></a> These words indicate the place taken by Jesus at a given time, without looking at what He was previously.<a name=3:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 5.<a name=3:14></a> "Thou art my Son: today have I begotten thee.<a name=3:15></a>" Scripture speaks of Jesus as Son in two different aspects: as Son of God, born in the world, and Son according to the eternal relationship.<a name=3:16></a> This verse refers to the first of these: Jesus is seen here not in His glory as essentially divine, but in His glory as born Son.<a name=3:17></a> Nevertheless it is very important to consider the glory of Jesus as Son of God before His incarnation; for we could not speak of the love of God as we do, if the One He gave us was not His Son.<a name=3:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verses 7-9.<a name=3:19></a> "Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.<a name=3:20></a>" It has pleased God to give to these agents of His power this nature of spirits.<a name=3:21></a> But as to the Son it is said, "Thy throne, O God!<a name=3:22></a>" God, in the exercise of His will, makes of His angels spirits, or flames of fire; but of the Son we do not read that God <i>makes</i> anything of Him.<a name=3:23></a> God said of Him, "O God!<a name=3:24></a>" This Son exists or subsists in the divinity.<a name=3:25></a> Though the angels are in a state superior to that of man, they are, notwithstanding their glory, in a condition very inferior to that of the Son.<a name=3:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In these three verses the Lord is seen in a personal glory higher than what is shewn in verses 4-6.<a name=3:27></a> There we have the Son begotten of God, here He is God Himself.<a name=3:28></a> "Thy throne O God, is for ever and ever.<a name=3:29></a>" How much doth this raise the dignity of Messiah!<a name=3:30></a> Nevertheless the same One, who is God, is anointed by God.<a name=3:31></a> He becomes man and is in a condition where He finds companions.<a name=3:32></a> Wonderful link of man with God in Christ!<a name=3:33></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Thy throne"; not the Father's throne, but the governmental throne of Messiah.<a name=4:1></a> "Thy companions," or, as in Psalm 45 from which these words are quoted, "thy fellows.<a name=4:2></a>" When Christ is in the humiliation of the cross God calls Him His Fellow (Zechariah 13); when He is in glory, God then gives us to Him for companions.<a name=4:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verses 10-12.<a name=4:4></a> Here is a higher degree of Christ's glory.<a name=4:5></a> He is the eternal God, creator of all things.<a name=4:6></a> It is no more Godhead hidden in the anointed Man, but the Creator-God -- Godhead fully revealed.<a name=4:7></a> Thus, there is no room for misconception as to the Person of the Messiah.<a name=4:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 13.<a name=4:9></a> The superiority of Jesus over the angels is doubly established.<a name=4:10></a> The Holy Ghost, after having put Him in contrast with the angels as regards His divine Person, views Him as man; "To which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand?<a name=4:11></a>" This contrast of the Man-Messiah with the angels goes on in the next chapter.<a name=4:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		CHAPTER 2
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verses 1-4.<a name=4:13></a> This is an exhortation of the Holy Ghost brought in parenthetically.<a name=4:14></a> We must keep close to the word of God, the more so as having been pronounced by the Lord Himself.<a name=4:15></a> How shall we escape if we neglect it?<a name=4:16></a> This greater privilege imposes greater responsibility.<a name=4:17></a> It is the preaching of a great salvation, made by the Lord Himself when on earth; not the gospel preached and the church united after the death of Christ.<a name=4:18></a> This testimony consequently goes on to the millennium without speaking of the church, a fact to be noticed not only in these verses but in the whole epistle.<a name=4:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We find also in this exhortation that the testimony of the apostles is swallowed up in the apostleship of Christ.<a name=4:20></a> Paul is apart from it; thus we see a difference between the testimony of Paul and that of Peter.<a name=4:21></a> In Peter's discourses in the Acts he never presents the Lord as Son of God.<a name=4:22></a> In conformity to the testimony addressed to Israel, he presents in Jesus the Man approved of God down here, risen afterwards, and glorified by God in seating Him at His right hand, "as Lord and Christ.<a name=4:23></a>" Whilst Paul, who was brought in outside the teaching of the twelve to reveal that free grace of God which forms a church united to Christ in heaven, sets himself from the beginning of his testimony to shew clearly that Jesus is the Son of God.<a name=4:24></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 5.<a name=5:1></a> "For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come of which we speak.<a name=5:2></a>" This is millennial glory.<a name=5:3></a> The words "the world to come" do not apply to heaven, but there will be a change on earth.<a name=5:4></a> Angels are the instruments of the providential government of God during the present period.<a name=5:5></a> We are still in the age which existed before the coming of Christ -- an age which began with Noah.<a name=5:6></a> But we must notice the two principal phases of it: Moses and Sinai, the time of separation from the age for Israel; and Nebuchadnezzar in whom God entrusted the power to the Gentiles when He declared His people Lo-Ammi; "not my people.<a name=5:7></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 9.<a name=5:8></a> "A little inferior to the angels for the suffering of death"; "a little" refers to the degree rather than time.<a name=5:9></a> Jesus went down to the lowest of creation to be able to grasp it all.<a name=5:10></a> But this point is not unfolded here; it is only said that He went lower than the angels.<a name=5:11></a> Notice that in this place the death of Jesus is attached to God's grace; "By the grace of God," it is said, He suffered death for all.<a name=5:12></a> It is the Man who died to accomplish the grace of a God of love.<a name=5:13></a> Other passages present, in the death of Christ, the Man falling under the judgment of God.<a name=5:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 10.<a name=5:15></a> "For it became him for whom are all things," etc.<a name=5:16></a> The first object was to bring many sons to glory; but it was necessary that the One who presented Himself before the majesty of God for man should bear the consequences of the state in which man was found.<a name=5:17></a> "It became him," God, "for whom are all things and by whom are all things.<a name=5:18></a>" It became His Majesty that the Prince of salvation should pass through the suffering of death.<a name=5:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 11.<a name=5:20></a> "For both he that sanctifieth and those who are sanctified are all of one.<a name=5:21></a>" Christ is a separated Person and exercises a sanctifying power.<a name=5:22></a> We, as children of faith, are sanctified by the double fact that we are separated in Him, and we receive of His power a new life.<a name=5:23></a> What He is as man, we are by the new life in us.<a name=5:24></a> When on the earth He was dependent on His God, obedient, separate from evil, etc.<a name=5:25></a>: we are such also by a moral fact, and become so practically.<a name=5:26></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"Are all of one.<a name=6:1></a>" We are in the same condition as the Head of this new family, which could not be the case with angels.<a name=6:2></a> The first time we see Jesus identifying Himself with man is when entering His public career.<a name=6:3></a> At John's baptism He identified Himself with those in whom grace had produced the first movement of faith in answer to the testimony of God.<a name=6:4></a> He did not place Himself with the infidels who despised the testimony of John and refused His baptism, but with the pious remnant in whom, though very weak at the beginning, grace was operating.<a name=6:5></a> That class of people, put aside by John's baptism, formed at the time the sanctified ones, "the saints in the earth" on whom the good pleasure of the Lord was resting; Psalm 16.<a name=6:6></a> But it is not said of Jesus and of men, that they are all of one: it is said, "He that sanctifieth and those who are sanctified are all of one.<a name=6:7></a>"<a href="#6:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"He is not ashamed to call them brethren.<a name=6:8></a>" Jesus gave this title of 'brethren' after His resurrection, not before.<a name=6:9></a> He has put us into <i>His</i> position, but not when He came down to ours.<a name=6:10></a><a href="#6:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 13.<a name=6:14></a> "I will put my trust in him," as God.<a name=6:15></a> Taking the position of man, He had necessarily to take this condition.<a name=6:16></a> He walked as a pious man in the dependence of faith.<a name=6:17></a> These words "I will put my trust in him" correspond to the expression "all of one" (verse 113.<a name=6:18></a> They shew that walking by faith and realising the life of the remnant were in Jesus who identified Himself with the rescued ones of His people.<a name=6:19></a> The two things, the life of faith in Messiah, and His association with the remnant of Israel, are found in Psalm 16: 1-3.<a name=6:20></a>

	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#6:f3"><sup>+++</sup></a>We remark in Psalm 22 three classes of people associated with the joy of Messiah delivered from death. In verse 22 are those whom Jesus names His "brethren," and of whom He makes a congregation -- the "little flock" -- "Go and tell my brethren." In verse 25 is "the great congregation": Judah and Israel; in verse 27 "All the ends of the earth." The title of "brethren" belongs to the remnant which will be on the earth after the rapture of the saints, also to the one which exists now, and the blessing of Hebrews 2 will be free to have its course in favour of the saints till the moment of Christ's appearing.

		"Himself has suffered.<a name=7:17></a>" There is no suffering when one gives way to temptation, but there is suffering if one resists it.<a name=7:18></a> In that case, the more there is of suffering, the more of spiritual life is revealed.<a name=7:19></a> Christ was really tempted; and though for Him the evil could come only from outside, still He suffered under the pressure of temptation.<a name=7:20></a> Having known temptation, Christ can sympathise with those who suffer being tempted, and He can come to their help.<a name=7:21></a> He does not bring any help to innocent man, nor to man in sin, but He brings succour to the saints in their struggle with sin.<a name=7:22></a> The power of temptation is less when it is felt than before it is felt or discerned.<a name=7:23></a> But when the struggle comes we find Christ to sustain, however serious may be the case.<a name=7:24></a> If one has fallen, two things remain to do; to extirpate whatever opened the door to the enemy (in other words, to judge the evil to the root); and in the future to leave oneself in the Lord's hands.<a name=7:25></a> The two things are seen in Peter's case; John 21.<a name=7:26></a>

	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#7:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>"Being tempted" is to be induced to act beneath the position in which we are before God. There man fell. Jesus alone could stand. The Christian is also tempted; the worldly man, as slave, is the more easily carried away by Satan.

		Chapters 3 and 4 are a digression; they present a subject totally different, which, though not the apostleship nor priesthood, is nevertheless attached to these two subjects.<a name=8:1></a> There are literally two digressions: the first (chapter 3) looks at the Son as set over His house, and is linked to the glory of God in chapter 1; the second (chapter 4) takes up the promised rest, and links itself to the glory of the Son of man in chapter 2.<a name=8:2></a>

		"Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the holy calling.<a name=8:7></a>" It is only in chapter 3 that the author of the book speaks to the Hebrews.<a name=8:8></a> It presents many indications that the epistle was by Paul; but, not being an apostle of the circumcision, he does not mention his name.<a name=8:9></a> He writes not as an apostle but as a teacher.<a name=8:10></a> The expression "holy brethren" indicates here individuals called from heaven, and walking towards heaven without meaning the church, although that is composed of persons equally called from on high.<a name=8:11></a> The holy calling admits, with the saints of this dispensation, those of the Old Testament, and probably also the saints which will be on the earth after the rapture of the saints.<a name=8:12></a> In the course of the epistle the holy calling is put in contrast with the earthly calling of the Jews.<a name=8:13></a>

		This house, as we see, answers to the tabernacle formed in the wilderness, and presents its two features.<a name=9:1></a> It is first the house of God as uniting the whole of creation (verse 4).<a name=9:2></a> God dwells amid His works.<a name=9:3></a> It is in that sense, and alluding to the High Priest passing through the tabernacle with the blood, that it is said of Jesus, "He has passed through the heavens.<a name=9:4></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Secondly, It is also the house of God as gathering the called ones.<a name=9:5></a> God resides in the midst of His saints.<a name=9:6></a> We Christians are "his house," the family He governs.<a name=9:7></a> This, though gathering those who are called, does not present itself under the special conditions of the church as a body.<a name=9:8></a> It is one thing to say of a man he is the head of a house, and another to say he has a wife.<a name=9:9></a> The called saints form the house of God existing now, as the house of Israel formed the previous one.<a name=9:10></a> The expression "house of Israel" signifies the posterity of Israel, but considered in the conditions and collective privileges of the whole family.<a name=9:11></a> It is in the same sense that it is also said, "the house of David," and "the house of Aaron.<a name=9:12></a>" There is this difference between the house of Israel and the house which today unites the holy brethren: the one was formed by descendants, and the other is by calling.<a name=9:13></a> Peter speaks also of the saints as being the house -- a spiritual house; the edifice.<a name=9:14></a> The Epistle to the Hebrews views the house in the members which composed it.<a name=9:15></a>

		Verse 6.<a name=9:16></a> As it is by calling, it is necessarily by faith that this house is formed.<a name=9:17></a> If faith is forsaken, the house exists no more.<a name=9:18></a> This is what the Holy Ghost is putting before the consciences of the Hebrews to encourage them to persevere: "Dwell in faith, else you will not be recognised"; for they were always inclined to keep to things that were visible.<a name=9:19></a> "If we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.<a name=9:20></a>" This advice, given for the interests of the house, is nevertheless given to individuals.<a name=9:21></a> Responsibility is always individual, even when it is meant for common interests.<a name=9:22></a> We must keep firm confidence and rejoicing of the hope.<a name=9:23></a> Glorious privileges which bind us together!<a name=9:24></a> The security of the saints is in no way touched by this; for the advice is for each individual practically, and not on the doctrine of security.<a name=9:25></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We enter here into the main subject of the epistle, namely, the priesthood of Christ.<a name=12:1></a> The developments of it extend to chapter 10: 22.<a name=12:2></a> During the course of these developments a contrast is drawn between Christ and Aaron, and also between the two priesthoods with the view of unfolding how the new institution is far superior to the old one.<a name=12:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 5.<a name=12:4></a> The principal subject brought to view is the glorious introduction of Jesus into the priesthood, and the appreciation of the qualities with which our Lord entered into this new office.<a name=12:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verses 1-4.<a name=12:6></a> The priesthood being a mediatorial charge, established to maintain the relationship of the weak and the infirm with God in His majesty, it was necessary that the high priest should be endowed with qualities which enabled him to shew compassion to those who were weak and infirm.<a name=12:7></a> Aaron as a man subject to infirmities as other men, would have failed in this condition of the priesthood if he had not found in the priesthood itself what fitted him for compassion and sympathy.<a name=12:8></a> He was to offer sacrifices not only for the people but also for himself, and these offerings produced feelings towards others; for at the same time that they established his position before God, they were also the commemoration of his own infirmities.<a name=12:9></a> Qualities then were necessary in the high priest's person.<a name=12:10></a> But Aaron was trusted with the charge solely on account of God's call.<a name=12:11></a> "And no man taketh this honour unto himself but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.<a name=12:12></a>" The high priest was called of God to that charge, and was formed by Him to maintain it.<a name=12:13></a> These are the two principles unfolded to us by the Holy Ghost in the Levitical priesthood.<a name=12:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verses 5, 6.<a name=12:15></a> But if there are qualities and titles belonging to the dignity of a high priest, it is Jesus who possesses them and unites them gloriously in His own Person.<a name=12:16></a> In Him it is not a high priest as an infirm man under the obligation of offering for himself before offering for others; no, but we have the Son of God proclaimed High Priest by God Himself -- Him to whom God said, "Thou art my Son, today have I begotten thee .<a name=12:17></a>.<a name=12:18></a>.<a name=12:19></a> .<a name=12:20></a> Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedec.<a name=12:21></a>" Jesus has before God a position entirely His own, a position which belongs to Him as Son.<a name=12:22></a> And more: His Person presents the high dignity that He could not only offer the sacrifice, but could offer Himself.<a name=12:23></a> It is according to these personal perfections that Jesus was entrusted with the priesthood, and is now before God.<a name=12:24></a> Blessed be God!<a name=12:25></a> who has given us for High Priest the Son of His love, He who gave His life for the life of wicked man, and whose mercies towards the infirm could not fail us whose weakness demands of the High Priest every day new supplies of compassion and mercies!<a name=12:26></a>

		Verses 7, 8.<a name=13:1></a> Nevertheless, if Jesus did not require to be formed in order to shew compassion, He had to learn something: "He learned obedience through the things which he suffered.<a name=13:2></a>" He learned, not to obey, "for the law of God was in his heart," but He learned obedience, having been obedient in circumstances the lowest and most painful which it was possible for man to pass through, for He went down to death.<a name=13:3></a> If Jesus suffered, it was not for Him a necessity which He could not avoid: it was according to the will of God who had appointed Him that portion in the world.<a name=13:4></a> The Holy Ghost makes us feel the right Jesus had not to pass through death, when He says, "though he were Son.<a name=13:5></a>" Jesus passed through all the degrees of man's sufferings, so that there is nothing in the sorrows of His saints which He does not know, and is unable to sympathise with them in.<a name=13:6></a> But this school of suffering He went through, before being made High Priest, "during the days of his flesh"; and now that He has gone through it all He succours us.<a name=13:7></a> This is a case very different from that of Aaron and his sons.<a name=13:8></a> It was needful that they should be in the same circumstances as their brethren, infirmity being necessary to them for the fulfilling of their functions, whilst in the new priesthood the One who exercises it is not a man in infirmity.<a name=13:9></a> It is the Son without weakness, who knows by past experience the whole truth as to the state of man.<a name=13:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplication with strong crying and tears, unto him that was able to save him from death.<a name=13:11></a>" At this time the enemy, who at the outset had sought to seduce Jesus by offering Him the things that are agreeable to man (Luke 4), was presenting himself against Him with the terrible things.<a name=13:12></a> Jesus never asked that any cup should pass from Him, save that one which meant that God would hide His face from Him.<a name=13:13></a> He felt in His soul at that hour of Gethsemane all the pangs attending the reception of the blow which God Himself was about to direct against Him.<a name=13:14></a> However, when He enters into the thought that it is the Father who has prepared the cup, He accepts it and offers Himself.<a name=13:15></a> In Gethsemane Jesus had to contend with the power of the enemy: "This is your hour and the power of darkness.<a name=13:16></a>" On the cross He bore the wrath of God, and cried, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?<a name=13:17></a>"

		"And was heard.<a name=14:1></a>" Jesus was heard, in the first place, by an internal deliverance, inasmuch as He was enabled to take the cup from His Father's hand, and not from the hand of Satan.<a name=14:2></a> In His struggle in Gethsemane He overcame the direct power of the adversary.<a name=14:3></a> The latter, conquered in the conflict he had entered into against the soul of Christ, was powerless when he came in his instruments.<a name=14:4></a> The hour of the power of darkness was not entirely spent; but Jesus, delivered from the terrors the enemy had pressed on His soul, and free to escape death if He chose, gave Himself up.<a name=14:5></a> He advances towards the wicked and delivers Himself into their hands.<a name=14:6></a> Evidently His soul was no longer under the pressure of the enemy.<a name=14:7></a> But He was more entirely heard in His resurrection.<a name=14:8></a> "He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of days, for ever and ever," Psalm 21: 4.<a name=14:9></a>

		"And was heard in that he feared.<a name=14:10></a>" It may be quite as well rendered "on account of his piety" or "of his respect.<a name=14:11></a>" It is the same word as in chapter 12: 28, "with reverence and godly fear.<a name=14:12></a>" "By the things which he suffered.<a name=14:13></a>" Instead of fulfilling righteousness in an even path, He met with constantly growing difficulties.<a name=14:14></a> He suffered in order to learn obedience.<a name=14:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verses 9, 10.<a name=14:16></a> All trial being ended for Jesus, God brought Him to perfection by placing Him in a condition where no trial is possible and into which Jesus entered; being acquainted with the suffering of a holy man, struggling with this world, and the power of darkness.<a name=14:17></a> It is in this position that God has proclaimed Him High Priest.<a name=14:18></a> Thus Jesus, far from being with us in a fellowship of suffering, is the One who is with God (having overcome everything) and who gives us the help needed to bring us out of our distresses.<a name=14:19></a> It is as Man that Jesus exercises the priesthood, but, what is very remarkable, it is as the Son that He has been declared Priest.<a name=14:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		If, by the very nature of this office, it was needful that He should be the Man-mediator, it was necessary also that His work should commence with God, from whom all grace flows.<a name=14:21></a> But the Son, before receiving the priesthood, was led by God through suffering in order to prepare Him for this office.<a name=14:22></a> This sums up into two leading subjects the truth concerning the priesthood of Christ which are put forth in this chapter.<a name=14:23></a>

		Verses 4-8.<a name=15:9></a> To return to these early Jewish notions, after having received a promised faith in a heavenly Christ, is to be in the road to forsake Christ Himself.<a name=15:10></a> Now, from such a fall there is no recovery.<a name=15:11></a> All the characteristics mentioned in verses 4, 5, may be possessed in the church without being born of the Spirit.<a name=15:12></a> One may be a partaker of the Holy Ghost, that is to say participate in His operations, without necessarily having received the Holy Ghost who dwells in the saints and is in them the seal of their faith and redemption.<a name=15:13></a> Indeed, it was by the Holy Ghost that Balaam, viewing from the heights the beauty of the camp of Israel, rejoiced and exclaimed: "How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O Israel!<a name=15:14></a>" and yet the sequel shews that he was not a child of God.<a name=15:15></a>

		But first there are some general remarks.<a name=17:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verses 1-3.<a name=17:2></a> Priesthood and royalty were combined in Melchisedec.<a name=17:3></a> He was priest of the Most High God, possessor of heaven and earth.<a name=17:4></a> This name Most High God is that which God takes in the millennium, and the royal priesthood is also that which Jesus will exercise in the times of the restitution of all things; but it is not under this aspect that the priesthood is unfolded in the Hebrews.<a name=17:5></a> With regard to the type of Melchisedec it is shewn that Jesus was appointed High Priest after that order; but where the present exercise of the office entrusted to our Lord is spoken of, the Holy Ghost takes the type from the priesthood of Aaron.<a name=17:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Without father, without mother, without descent.<a name=17:7></a>" Melchisedec, though a typical man, is nevertheless a real personage whom sacred history brings on the scene in circumstances calculated to set forth the great principles of the glorious priesthood of our Lord, who is shewn exercising a priesthood as endless as His days.<a name=17:8></a> Scripture does not speak of his birth, death or pedigree, thus making an exception, for usually in the Old Testament, when persons having a prominent place in the ways of God are spoken of, we get their genealogy, etc.<a name=17:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verses 4-10.<a name=17:10></a> This king, priest of the Most High God, is a greater man than Levi, the root of the priestly family established under the law; for when he met Abraham, the father of Levi, he received tithes from the patriarch and blessed him: a first proof of the superiority of Christ as priest after the order of Melchisedec over Aaron, priest of the lineage of Levi.<a name=17:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verses 11-19.<a name=17:12></a> The bringing in of Jesus as priest after the order of Melchisedec involves the substitution of a better priesthood than that of Aaron.<a name=17:13></a>

		Verses 12-17.<a name=17:16></a> The order being changed, the new priesthood is necessarily founded on new principles.<a name=17:17></a> Christ, consequently, is not subject to the Levitical ordinance by which the priests entered into office in virtue of their hereditary right as sons of Aaron, and that only for a limited number of years.<a name=17:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		After the similitude of Melchisedec He is in the priesthood, without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days nor end of life.<a name=17:19></a> He possesses an intransmissible office and holds it in the power of an endless life.<a name=17:20></a>

		"A better hope," that is, the hope of heavenly things and the favour of receiving them, not by righteousness of man but by grace.<a name=18:5></a> See chapter 6: 19, 20.<a name=18:6></a> Our hope adds, to the privilege of inheriting heavenly things, that of being brought nigh to God.<a name=18:7></a> There was nothing of this kind under the Levitical economy; all was connected with the possession of Canaan and the government of Jehovah.<a name=18:8></a> Far from admitting man into His presence, God remained hidden in the sanctuary.<a name=18:9></a> But the excellency of the priesthood of Christ further appears by many more privileges.<a name=18:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The next reason was for our sins: "To make reconciliation (or, atone) for the sins of the people.<a name=42:3></a>" We have got God glorified, Satan destroyed in his power over us, sins -- those of all believers I mean -- gone.<a name=42:4></a> All that is not wilderness work, it is accomplished work.<a name=42:5></a> God is glorified; Satan's power destroyed: our sins all borne: that is all done -- if it is not, it never can be.<a name=42:6></a>

		"WHAT IS MAN?"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hebrews 2: 5-18
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A wonderful inquiry this is, which is quoted from Psalm 8: "What is man that thou art mindful of him?<a name=47:1></a>" It is an inquiry founded upon his nothingness in himself, but bringing out, in God's answer to it, all His own counsels in Christ.<a name=47:2></a> "What is man that thou art mindful of him?<a name=47:3></a>" Such is his littleness; yet, when it comes to be answered not according to what man is but in the counsels of God, we find him to be the one in whom all the wisdom of God is displayed.<a name=47:4></a> Nor is it the display of power merely -- creation shews that -- but all those qualities in God where His nature comes out, which are more than attributes.<a name=47:5></a> Power can say a word, and the thing is done: very wonderful, of course; but there is a great deal more than this.<a name=47:6></a> Man is the one in whom angels have to learn what God is in His ways and counsels, for the simple reason that the Word of God was in those counsels to become a man -- that He who created angels does not take up angels, but takes up man.<a name=47:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus necessarily all the ways and qualities of God (I use these words as distinct from mere attributes, such as of power, and the like), His holiness, love, and righteousness, all these come out in man; because they were associated with the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=47:8></a> It is this that gives man such a wonderful position.<a name=47:9></a> And then it is not like the angels -- glorious creatures, but preserved by the power of God unfallen, while that shews His ways in this respect, His power to do so, if He please.<a name=47:10></a> But men are taken up when they are sinners to display the glory of God in them; and this is another matter.<a name=47:11></a> Things that are in the highest (a revelation of the character of God) do not come out in angels.<a name=47:12></a> No doubt angels in a certain way want mercy; no creature can even stand without being sustained.<a name=47:13></a> This is quite true, as I am sure we all know; but they do not want redemption, and as regards grace, mercy, love, all these come out in man.<a name=47:14></a> As Paul says, "We are a spectacle to the world, to angels, and to men.<a name=47:15></a>" In carrying all this out, we have the special testimony of the responsibility of man as an unfallen creature, one who was made in the image of God, which is never said of angels; but in that, when he did fall, we find grace and power coming in and connecting him with the Creator Himself, so that Christ is not ashamed to call them brethren.<a name=47:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This is what is brought out so wonderfully by the question -- "What is man?<a name=48:1></a>" It was a testimony to man's lowliness, taking him in himself, crushed; but the moment we have the thoughts of God (verse 7-9), this puts us in a wonderful place.<a name=48:2></a> Angels excel us in glory and strength; but they are not said to be in the image of God, and there never was any being set up to be the centre of an immense system that was to turn round himself, till man was (Adam, of course, I mean); but this is fallen now, and every one is seeking to be a centre for himself.<a name=48:3></a> The whole system therefore is under the bondage of corruption now.<a name=48:4></a> But in the Lord Jesus man will be the centre of everything that God created.<a name=48:5></a> He has put under the Lord all the works of His hands; yet when He said "all things," it is manifest that He is excepted who put all things under Him: God alone is the one exception.<a name=48:6></a> The statement of the exception proves that all else is put under Him.<a name=48:7></a> But man in the Person of Christ is Lord of all.<a name=48:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus the lordship of Christ over everything is not only dominion, but this in a Redeemer, in One who keeps it safe, One who descended first into the lower parts of the earth, to death, but who descended that He might ascend up far above all heavens and fill all things.<a name=48:9></a> But He fills all things in the power of the redemption He brought out.<a name=48:10></a> God will gather together in one all things which are in heaven and which are on earth in Him, even in Christ.<a name=48:11></a> They were created by Him and for Him, but while presently He becomes Head, He does not take them until He can take them as Man.<a name=48:12></a> And then too what is brought in is that we are heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ; as He says again in John 17, "The glory which thou gavest me I have given them, that they may be one even as we are one.<a name=48:13></a>" These are to come in, though, of course, He is the firstborn amongst many brethren.<a name=48:14></a> He brings us in every respect into the relationship in which He stands Himself as Man.<a name=48:15></a> Son Himself, He makes us sons, and He takes His place in resurrection that it may be made ours: for He tells us, "I go to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.<a name=48:16></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there is another thing to weigh that is so wonderful -- it is all by redemption.<a name=48:17></a> How could He take sinners and put them in such a place with Himself?<a name=48:18></a> Not as sinners; and so He comes down where the sinners are, and puts Himself (sinless, of course) in their place: and in this I learn where I am.<a name=48:19></a> "If one died for all, then were all dead.<a name=48:20></a>" God "made him to be sin for us.<a name=48:21></a>" He came down to the place of death and judgment, passing through all the toil and difficulty of this world as we do, but perfect in it all, that He might take our hearts up where He is, giving a title by redemption and a condition by grace in which we could be associated with Him as the firstborn among many brethren.<a name=48:22></a> It is not merely the fact that I am saved, which is true; but He has associated Himself with us down here, in order that He might take up our hearts there by the love He has brought down into them -- up into the very place where He is gone, making all the Father's love known to us; for the word is "Thou hast loved them as thou hast loved me.<a name=48:23></a>" It is not only that I have a place in glory in consequence; but Christ is come for the purpose of associating us with Himself in heart and spirit and mind, so that He should not be ashamed to call us brethren.<a name=48:24></a> He might well be ashamed if He took us as we are.<a name=48:25></a>

		We see the various characters of the way God brought Him through, and He could say Himself, "Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.<a name=49:1></a>" He was in Himself a sweet savour to God, beyond the putting away of our sins.<a name=49:2></a> In this chapter are given the various grounds upon which He had to go through this place of sorrow in order that we might have this blessing with Him.<a name=49:3></a> "It became him in bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.<a name=49:4></a>" The truth upon which it is all founded is this -- the great original truth -- that He was rejoicing in the habitable parts of God's earth; that is, Christ Himself was wisdom in Proverbs 8, and "his delights were with the sons of men.<a name=49:5></a>" Thus Christ is the wisdom of God, and He was God's delight from all eternity.<a name=49:6></a> "I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him.<a name=49:7></a>" There I get the link formed with the eternal objects of the Father's delight.<a name=49:8></a> Where did His delight go out?<a name=49:9></a> Into the habitable parts of the earth before even they were made.<a name=49:10></a> "I was by him as one brought up with him"; but if we look where His heart went out, it was into the habitable parts of the earth and with the sons of men.<a name=49:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Also in due time He became a man: that is the source and foundation of it all to us.<a name=49:12></a> He took up the seed of Abraham, who are the heirs of faith.<a name=49:13></a> Then comes the purpose and plan, His gathering together in one all things which are in heaven and earth put under His hand as Man.<a name=49:14></a> The ground given in Hebrews 1 is that He is Son; in Colossians 1 it is that He created them; and in Psalm 8, Ephesians 1, as well as Colossians 1, it is that all things are put under Him according to God's counsels and plan.<a name=49:15></a> As Son, as Creator, and according to God's counsels, He takes all.<a name=49:16></a> "To the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak"; but "thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet.<a name=49:17></a>" "But now we see not yet all things put under him.<a name=49:18></a>"

		Such is the purpose and intention of God.<a name=50:1></a> There comes in the additional notice that "we see not yet all things put under Him.<a name=50:2></a>" There is only half of the Psalm fulfilled.<a name=50:3></a> He is crowned with glory and honour; but we see not yet the things put under His feet, for He is waiting for His joint-heirs.<a name=50:4></a> The time now is the gathering by the gospel the joint-heirs, that He may take His power and reign.<a name=50:5></a> As Paul says, "I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.<a name=50:6></a>" There was another set of promises belonging to this earth, and this we get in Psalm 2, where God sets His king in Zion, and says, "Ask of me, and I will give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.<a name=50:7></a>" This will be "the world to come"; but it is not the higher position of Him who is to have the world to come; and therefore in that connection we read of Christ's rejection, "Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?<a name=50:8></a> The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together against Jehovah and against his anointed" -- the very passage Peter quotes in Acts 4.<a name=50:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, being rejected, Christ takes another place -- on the Father's throne, where He now is: He is not on His own throne yet, but as He says, "to him that overcometh will I give to sit with me upon my throne, even as I also overcame and am set down with my Father upon his throne.<a name=50:10></a>" He sits as Man at the right hand of God, not having taken His own throne; and this He does not take until the joint-heirs are ready: Psalm 8 comes in (verse 6-9).<a name=50:11></a> Nathanael owned Him as Son of God and king of Israel; but to him our Lord replied: "Thou shalt see greater things than these.<a name=50:12></a> Henceforth [so it should be] ye shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.<a name=50:13></a>" It is a small thing, My title in Israel; but you shall see Psalm 8 fulfilled.<a name=50:14></a> He was rejected as the king of Zion, but He was cast out of the world that God's righteousness might be accomplished; and He was answered according to the value and virtue of what He had done in God's setting Him at His own right hand; and so it is said, "Sit at my right hand until I make thine enemies thy footstool.<a name=50:15></a>" This has not yet come; and therefore we must suffer with Him, because His enemies are not made His footstool.<a name=50:16></a> The world is round us, and Satan is not bound, and everything has been spoiled that God set up good; and so it will be until Satan is bound.<a name=50:17></a> So that plainly Christ is sitting at the right hand of God, not having taken His own throne, but with title over everything, not only as Creator but in redemption, having first descended into the lower parts of the earth; I say, with title over all things, but having taken none, with His enemies still in power and to rise up more dreadful than ever; and then all will be put down.<a name=50:18></a>

		Now we find this blessed One, of whom Adam was a figure, going to be centre of all things, though not yet.<a name=51:9></a> We find Him made a little lower than the angels, for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honour.<a name=51:10></a> Then we find the next point -- the way in which He was bringing others into full association of heart with Himself.<a name=51:11></a> All the glory was His; but He does not go and take His place at the right hand of God as Man until He has accomplished redemption, tasted death, gone down to the lowest place and condition to which man can go.<a name=51:12></a> I speak now of sufferings rather than atonement, though this is in the chapter.<a name=51:13></a> But He tastes death.<a name=51:14></a> He goes down to that in which the curse was expressed on the first man, and a great deal more, as we shall see.<a name=51:15></a> But it is here the great and blessed testimony to the way in which He took man up to glory.<a name=51:16></a> He came into the world and left it to go to the Father, but not by the aid of twelve legions of angels; but He as man goes through where we are, on His way as man to glory.<a name=51:17></a> I speak of the road He took.<a name=51:18></a> He tasted death.<a name=51:19></a> The great general fact is that He who created everything, and who is now sitting at the right hand of God, did not take that place until He had gone down to the lowest place, down to death: and this without speaking of atonement.<a name=51:20></a> Two things are there: the fact of the death and the life spent where hatred and death reigned.<a name=51:21></a> He came to destroy Satan's power; He came to glorify God; He came to be able to sympathise with every trial and difficulty and sorrow of my heart while trying to walk rightly.<a name=51:22></a> There are therefore objects: the glory of God, the propitiation for sin, the overcoming the power of Satan, and the entering into all our sorrows.<a name=51:23></a> This is what He does as Priest.<a name=51:24></a> He is touched with the feeling of our infirmities.<a name=51:25></a> We see Him, "Who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour.<a name=51:26></a>" "It became him [that is, God] in bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through suffering.<a name=51:27></a>" He was perfect Himself.<a name=51:28></a> He came from God, and went to God, and still was the Son of man who is in heaven; but He had come to obey, to serve us, and bring us there also; and if this were the case, He must take the consequences.<a name=51:29></a> The moment our blessed Lord had undertaken our cause, it became God to deal with Him according to the place He had taken.<a name=51:30></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The thought that runs through all this part of the scriptures, beloved friends, is this: our entering into the holiest, the true holiest, of course.<a name=66:1></a> The Spirit now referring to the tabernacle, was writing to the Hebrews, who were accustomed to it.<a name=66:2></a> The Christian is given boldness to enter into God's own presence, the holiest now, with a purged conscience.<a name=66:3></a> Here he unfolds what that is, to which we will turn with God's help.<a name=66:4></a> God has brought me in there by dealing both with sin, and with sins, so dealing with them as to put them away according to the exigency of what His holy nature is.<a name=66:5></a> God has stepped in and done that once for all: it consequently is an eternal redemption.<a name=66:6></a> There is that which is necessarily connected with this, and that is not only that the sins are purged, or else I could not come into the holiest.<a name=66:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		That is brought out in the next chapter in a singularly gracious way, that we may understand the divine source of this salvation and have a divine knowledge of it, divine certainty.<a name=66:8></a> If God had spoken, it is not I think, or I hope, but, I have set to my seal that God is true.<a name=66:9></a> The work is divine, the knowledge of it is divinely certain, and we are brought into the divine presence; this flows from God taking up the question of sin and sins.<a name=66:10></a> The conscience takes it up when the Spirit of God works in the soul, and our reasoning upon the possibility of being with God is always upon this footing, and must be so.<a name=66:11></a> This is the effect of reasoning from what we are to God.<a name=66:12></a> If I am a sinner, well, I say, how can He receive me?<a name=66:13></a> If I were righteous, He might receive me.<a name=66:14></a> We always reason from ourselves and our state to God; the Holy Ghost never does.<a name=66:15></a> He reasons from our state to condemnation; but in reasoning as to salvation, He always reasons from what God is and has done to this effect upon us, and never from what we are to God.<a name=66:16></a> I speak of salvation in speaking of the reasoning.<a name=66:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am saying this because, beloved friends, you will find it a constant tendency of your hearts to reason from what we are to what God will be for us.<a name=66:18></a> It will be fancied "humility," just like the prodigal son when he had not met his father, he was reasoning from what he was.<a name=66:19></a> When he had tasted God's goodness in a measure, reasoning from what he was, with some little glimpse of what God was in goodness, to what he would be when God met him in judgment.<a name=66:20></a> When the conscience is awake, I say, how can God meet me with all those sins?<a name=66:21></a> Quite true, that is judgment.<a name=66:22></a> Judgment is according to works; but as to that.<a name=66:23></a> the sinner is brought to own that he is lost.<a name=66:24></a> God is of purer eyes than to behold sin, and man finds that he is a sinner.<a name=66:25></a> What the gospel comes and reveals to us is God's intervention for those that are such, so that we reason from what God has done to what He will do.<a name=66:26></a> For instance "He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?<a name=66:27></a>" The Spirit of God reasons from what God has done to how He will act.<a name=66:28></a> "For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.<a name=66:29></a>" He reasons down from what God is and has done to what we are to God.<a name=66:30></a> Now, the Spirit of God leads so; but we continue that same thing until we have learnt that the simple result of what we are with God must be condemnation.<a name=66:31></a> Then we give it up, it is no good going on then: the case is settled.<a name=66:32></a> The gospel, when we are sinners, lost sinners, comes to reveal to us what God has done.<a name=66:33></a> The language and experience here take that very point, that it would have been judgment, if God had not interfered in grace.<a name=66:34></a>

		You see, beloved friends, that as a sinner, I am really brought to the sense that I am lost, and I am cast upon what God has done for me.<a name=67:1></a> The real question is as to the efficacy of that work.<a name=67:2></a> That is what He has been unfolding, and insists upon.<a name=67:3></a> It is that I will look upon a little, for it changes my whole condition with God.<a name=67:4></a> I have God as a Saviour, not as a judge; as to my state of relationship with Him, He is always that for me.<a name=67:5></a> And He is that, because I was <i>lost</i>.<a name=67:6></a> The work of Christ has purged my conscience and put away my sins.<a name=67:7></a> I affirm that the rather, beloved friends, because there is the constant tendency to mix up the two, because we are apt to mix up the state of our souls with the sense of the completeness of the work God has wrought for us in Christ.<a name=67:8></a> I would not hinder exercise of conscience, but there are conclusions drawn from the state we are in, to question the completeness and the efficacy of that work.<a name=67:9></a> That is the mischief.<a name=67:10></a> We cannot press the devotedness and full following of the Christian too much; but if I mix up what I have felt with what God tells me of the efficacy of the work of Christ, I am mixing water with good wine, and both are spoilt.<a name=67:11></a> We never get right till we have got the thorough effect in our souls of our sins, and our sinfulness too.<a name=67:12></a> "I find that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing.<a name=67:13></a>"

		Well, when I learn that they that are in the flesh cannot please God, that the flesh has lusts and the law condemns them -- the flesh has a will, and the law forbids its desires; I find that I am lost.<a name=68:1></a> Man finds that there always is a will of his own and lusts.<a name=68:2></a> The Christian condemns them, and judges them; still that which is born of the flesh is flesh.<a name=68:3></a> I may reckon it dead, and hold it dead, but that is what it is.<a name=68:4></a> If I am looking at myself as a child of Adam standing before God, I have lusts and a will that is evil.<a name=68:5></a> Well, is He going to justify evil?<a name=68:6></a> No.<a name=68:7></a> What God does, beloved friends, is to bring in Christ.<a name=68:8></a> If the man is a sinner, He judges his sins; but the work is often deeper when the man is a fair honest character, as Paul was.<a name=68:9></a> Why, the man could not eat for three days!<a name=68:10></a> As to conscience, he thought he ought to destroy Jesus of Nazareth, religiously misguided as he was -- all his religious leaders sent him forth to do it, and he had been trying to make out a righteousness by it; and supposing that he could -- those things that were his righteousness just brought him into open enmity against God.<a name=68:11></a> He was consciously trying to destroy Christ!<a name=68:12></a> God has taken care that, when man fell and was turned out of Eden, he should carry out a conscience with him.<a name=68:13></a> A thief, or a murderer, or a fornicator, whatever it might be, he knows it is wrong, not only that God does not allow it.<a name=68:14></a> I find the struggling of these lusts; the moment I find this in the spirituality of the law, I see I have a bad nature; the tree is bad.<a name=68:15></a> Well, then, the man is brought to complete condemnation, not a pleasant thing at all.<a name=68:16></a> He comes to see that he cannot please God.<a name=68:17></a> Why the heart of man rebels against it in an awful way -- thinks it a cruel thing to say that he cannot please God.<a name=68:18></a> Therefore God does bring me (a person like Paul perhaps, in three days; where sin has been in a grosser shape, the conviction may not be so deep) to the consciousness not merely of what I have done, but of what I am.<a name=68:19></a> I find not merely that the fruit is bad, but that the tree is bad.<a name=68:20></a> Why have we committed sin?<a name=68:21></a> Because we liked it.<a name=68:22></a> A man is morally what he likes; a man who loves money is a covetous man; if he likes amusements, he is a man of pleasure.<a name=68:23></a> We like sin; that is what we are.<a name=68:24></a> Christ changes this.<a name=68:25></a>

		I say so, because we must be brought clearly out of this mixing up of what we are with what God has been for us in grace, this looking at God as one that judges instead of one that saves; and saying: "Well, if I am all this, how am I to get salvation?<a name=69:1></a>" There must be this change effected.<a name=69:2></a> Put a man of the world in heaven, and he would get out of it if he could; there would be nothing he would like there; there would be none of the pleasures he cares for; there would be no money there, and the things that are there he would not like.<a name=69:3></a> Well, that is an awful thing to find out.<a name=69:4></a> It is not merely a question as to the imputing of my sins.<a name=69:5></a> Everybody in his senses would say: "Of course, I should like to go to heaven.<a name=69:6></a>" Well, if it is a thing you really wish, of course you would like to have it as soon as you can.<a name=69:7></a> When would you like to have it?<a name=69:8></a> To-day?<a name=69:9></a> To-morrow?<a name=69:10></a> When you cannot help it!<a name=69:11></a> I say this, beloved friends, to discover not what sins are, but what the flesh is.<a name=69:12></a> There is no good thing in it at all.<a name=69:13></a>

		I repeat it, beloved friends, there is often a deeper work goes on which judges the movements and principles of the heart, in one who is naturally an upright man, than there is where there is merely judgment passed on outward sins.<a name=69:14></a> I should be in despair about myself if I learnt my condition before God, and did not see the work of Christ for me; yet not quite in despair.<a name=69:15></a> Wherever God works in the conscience, there is always more or less of the sense of love in it.<a name=69:16></a> There is a conflict goes on, but always a sense of the love of God maintained.<a name=69:17></a> The man is in conflict between the sense of God's goodness in the heart, and the consciousness of the holiness of God's nature.<a name=69:18></a> It is a blessed truth that, wherever there is a work of God in the soul, there is always a clinging to the sense of His goodness, let the work of conscience be ever so deep.<a name=69:19></a> In the beautiful narrative in Matthew of the Syrophenician woman, she says: "I know I am a dog, but I know there is goodness enough in God to give even to a dog.<a name=69:20></a>" He cannot say there is not.<a name=69:21></a> There is one overleaping the barriers of dispensation in the sense of the goodness of God.<a name=69:22></a>

		CHRIST'S COMING, FAITH'S CROWNING
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hebrews 9: 27, 28
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle after speaking of Christ's first coming, and the work accomplished by Him, as the sacrifice for sin and of His having entered in once by His own blood into the holy place (heaven itself), "having obtained eternal redemption," sums up the whole doctrine in the closing verses of this chapter, and there contrasts, in a definite way, the portion of the first Adam and those who belong to the first Adam, with the place and expectations of the believer.<a name=82:1></a> "As it is appointed unto men once to die, but after that the judgment [that is what we have to say as to men, that there their history is ended], so Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many [for the believer death and judgment have been already met -- Christ having died for him and borne his sins]; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.<a name=82:2></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A word in explanation of a portion of this passage.<a name=82:3></a> The Lord Jesus, as regards Himself, appeared the first time, as truly "without sin," as He will the second.<a name=82:4></a> But then He appeared the first time, though without sin, yet about it (verse 26); He came to bear it.<a name=82:5></a> The second time He has nothing more to do with sin; it will be unto salvation," as He says, "I will come again and receive you unto myself, that where I am, there ye may be also," John 14.<a name=82:6></a> His second coming is to fulfil in the result all the designs of His first coming for those who believe.<a name=82:7></a> This makes it their hope -- "that blessed hope," Titus 2: 13.<a name=82:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This event has nothing whatever to do with death (with which it has often been confounded): so far from it, that, when the Lord Jesus Christ appears, if a believer be alive, he will never see death.<a name=82:9></a> See 1 Corinthians 15: 51, 52; 1 Thessalonians 4: 15, 17.<a name=82:10></a> So little has it to do with death, that the apostle declares expressly, "we shall not all sleep.<a name=82:11></a>" Here it is contrasted with death.<a name=82:12></a>

		The resurrection of the saints (the "first resurrection") takes place at Christ's coming; as it is said, "Every man in his own order: Christ the first-fruits; afterwards they that are Christ's at his coming.<a name=88:5></a>" This resurrection is altogether another thing from the resurrection of the wicked.<a name=88:6></a> There will be a resurrection, both of the just, and of the unjust, but on different principles.<a name=88:7></a> The former have life in Christ, which life has nothing in common with the world around.<a name=88:8></a> Moreover, they have the Spirit of God dwelling in them.<a name=88:9></a> "If the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you," Romans 8: 11.<a name=88:10></a> "The body is .<a name=88:11></a>.<a name=88:12></a>.<a name=88:13></a> for the Lord and the Lord for the body; and God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power," 1 Corinthians 6: 13, 14.<a name=88:14></a> The body is the Lord's as well as the soul.<a name=88:15></a> As to the wicked, Christ raises them up for judgment, but not at the same time.<a name=88:16></a> Christ will accomplish, for the bodies of the saints, what He has already accomplished for the soul; the wicked will be called up for judgment, and forced to honour Christ in spite of themselves; John 5.<a name=88:17></a> In Luke 20: 35, 36, there is a remarkable distinction.<a name=88:18></a> As regards all my sins, He put them away at His first coming.<a name=88:19></a> I am going to appear before Him who has already died for me.<a name=88:20></a>

		When "Lo-ammi" was written upon Israel, God gave power into the hands of the Gentiles; Daniel 2.<a name=91:2></a> How is it that the kingdoms of this world are to become the kingdoms of our God and of His Christ?<a name=91:3></a> Is it by the preaching of the gospel -- a clear duty, whether the earth be filled by that, or whether judgment is to come first?<a name=91:4></a> The word says, "Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay and brake them in pieces.<a name=91:5></a> Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing-floors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them [there was the most complete and utter destruction of the whole system of the image]; and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth," verse 34, 35.<a name=91:6></a> There again I get a positive revelation that the universal prevalence of Christianity will be preceded by the execution of the judgments of God.<a name=91:7></a> The little stone cut out without hands does not become a mountain, etc.<a name=91:8></a>, until it has executed judgment upon, broken in pieces, and destroyed the image.<a name=91:9></a> And, note, the act of smiting the image and then filling the whole earth is not the setting up of Christ's kingdom at the day of Pentecost.<a name=91:10></a> It is not an influence that changes the gold, the silver, etc.<a name=91:11></a>, into the character of the stone; but the sudden execution of judgment upon the image -- a blow, which breaks in pieces, and leaves not a trace of the existence of the image, so that we read, "no place was found for them.<a name=91:12></a>"

		Hebrews 11
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We find in this chapter not exactly a definition of faith, but the effects of its power, brought before us; and this is to make things so present as that they should be real to the soul.<a name=94:1></a> The things looked out for are as substantial to the soul as if possessed, and this which are not seen are as vividly before us as if they were seen.<a name=94:2></a> This is what characterises a believer.<a name=94:3></a> He is a person who has such an evidence of things not seen as to govern his thoughts and affections, as his motive.<a name=94:4></a> The world in which he lives is seen and felt by faith.<a name=94:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is calculated to bring home that question in a man's soul which God Himself answers.<a name=94:6></a> Is there any substance in my soul?<a name=94:7></a> are things unseen as real to me as if I saw them?<a name=94:8></a> Faith is opposed to law; for "the law is not of faith.<a name=94:9></a>" Law brings out the rebellion of the will.<a name=94:10></a> The carnal mind is opposed to God's law; and, therefore, there is disobedience wherever there are self-will and law.<a name=94:11></a> If I have no law, I may do my own will; but if there is a law, it is the will of someone else I must do.<a name=94:12></a>

		There is another character of sin brought out here.<a name=94:13></a> It is not rebellion against a law, as in Adam.<a name=94:14></a> There was the absence of faith in Cain: while it is said of Abel, "by faith he offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain.<a name=94:15></a>" What substance have you of things hoped for?<a name=94:16></a> This question does not disturb one who has real faith.<a name=94:17></a> I do not ask if you live up to these things -- that is another question; but have you faith?<a name=94:18></a> The Jews had killed the Holy One and the Just, but they believed that He was the Holy and the Just One, for if they had not, they would have said, when they were charged with having killed Him, Oh, He was not the Holy and the Just One at all; but their very confession of "What shall we do?<a name=94:19></a>" proves that they did not deny His being so, and it made them fear.<a name=94:20></a> They were not what they should be, but they were pricked to the heart; and the effect of it is they cry out, "What shall we do to be saved?<a name=94:21></a>"

		The conscience may be frightened about sin, but that is not faith.<a name=94:22></a> There is no power in natural conscience to acquire life, but there is fear of punishment -- "a certain fearful looking for of judgment"; but this is not faith.<a name=94:23></a> There is nothing "hoped for.<a name=94:24></a>" Have you such a sense of the reality of future things on your heart?<a name=94:25></a> Is it a reality in your souls, so that it controls your thoughts and feelings and habits?<a name=94:26></a> If not, you have not faith.<a name=94:27></a> In the end of John 2 we see a class of persons on whom there was no insincerity charged, but there was no faith in them.<a name=94:28></a> They saw the miracles and they marvelled; but Christ did not commit Himself to them.<a name=94:29></a>

		Looked at historically, Christianity might seem a new thing.<a name=101:1></a> He had been but recently manifested; but who was He?<a name=101:2></a> and whence pad He come?<a name=101:3></a> He was "the first-born of every creature" -- yea, the Creator!<a name=101:4></a> "All things were created by him and for him; and he is before all things, and by him all things consist.<a name=101:5></a>" He was the One whom God intended to manifest from all eternity.<a name=101:6></a> And here we see Him in His complete Person -- "Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, and today, and for ever.<a name=101:7></a>" Through Him God could bless.<a name=101:8></a> With Him He would have us occupied.<a name=101:9></a>

		"To eat.<a name=101:22></a>" It was not merely the offering, nor the burning of the offering, but the partaking of it.<a name=101:23></a> We have got Christ Himself, and our sins put away -- sin, root and branch, dealt with by God.<a name=101:24></a> There is not now one question unsettled for us who believe.<a name=101:25></a> Has He one question unsettled with Christ?<a name=101:26></a> and if not with Christ, He has not with us, for He died and rose for us, and we are one with Him.<a name=101:27></a> As in the Jewish system, God and the offerer had their portions in the sacrifices, so now we may say that God has His own portion in the same Christ on whom we feed.<a name=101:28></a> The entrance into this exceedingly blessed thought is one of the things which the children of God greatly fail in -- that we are seated by God Himself at the same table where He has His own joy and portion.<a name=101:29></a> Of course there is that in which we cannot share.<a name=101:30></a> In the burnt-offering all went up to God.<a name=101:31></a> The sweet fragrance of all that Christ was goes up to Him.<a name=101:32></a> We must remember that God has His infinite joy in Christ; and not only for what He is in Himself, but for that which He has done for my sins.<a name=101:33></a> When we think of this, all of self is absorbed, and must sink before it.<a name=101:34></a> The old nature we have still; but it is in us to be crushed We have to treat it all, its likings and dislikings, as a hateful thing.<a name=101:35></a> But the new life needs sustaining.<a name=101:36></a> It grows by feeding.<a name=101:37></a> As in natural life, the mere possession of riches will not sustain life, but it has to be nourished; so in spiritual life, it is not only true that Christ is my life in the presence of God, but I must make Christ my own for my food -- eating of Him day by day; John 6.<a name=101:38></a> He is in very deed given to us, to be turned by faith into nourishment for us.<a name=101:39></a> And the sweet thing is that we are entitled thus to think of Christ, given by God to be this food for us.<a name=101:40></a> It is not only that Christ is God's, but He is ours too: our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.<a name=101:41></a>

		OBEDIENCE THE SAINT'S LIBERTY

	<div class="paragraph">
		The spirit of obedience is the great secret of all godliness.<a name=103:1></a> The spring of all evil from the beginning has been independence of will.<a name=103:2></a> Obedience is the only rightful state of the creature, or God would cease to be supreme -- would cease to be God.<a name=103:3></a> Where there is independence, there there is always sin.<a name=103:4></a> This rule, if remembered, would wonderfully help us in guiding our conduct.<a name=103:5></a>

		In this chapter the spirit of obedience is enforced towards those who rule in the church -- "obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves," verse 17.<a name=104:1></a> It is for our profit in everything, to seek after this spirit.<a name=104:2></a> "They watch for your souls," says the apostle, "as they that must give account.<a name=104:3></a>" Those whom the Lord puts into service He makes responsible to Himself.<a name=104:4></a> This is the real secret of all true service.<a name=104:5></a> It should be obedience, whether in those who rule, or those who obey.<a name=104:6></a> They are servants, and this is their responsibility.<a name=104:7></a> Woe unto them if they do not guide, direct, rebuke, etc.<a name=104:8></a>; if they do not do it, "the Lord" will require it of them.<a name=104:9></a> On the other hand, those counselled become directly responsible to "the Lord" for obedience.<a name=104:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The great guardian principle of all conduct in the church of God is personal responsibility to "the Lord.<a name=104:11></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		No guidance of another can ever come in between an individual's conscience and God.<a name=104:12></a> In popery this individual responsibility to God is taken away.<a name=104:13></a> Those who are spoken of in this chapter, as having the rule in the church, had to "give account" of their own conduct, and not of souls which were committed to them.<a name=104:14></a> There is no such thing as giving account of other people's souls; "every one of us must give an account of himself to God," Romans 14.<a name=104:15></a> Individual responsibility always secures the maintenance of God's authority.<a name=104:16></a> If those who watched for their souls had been faithful in their service, they would not have to give account "with grief," so far as they were concerned; but still it might be very "unprofitable" for the others, if they acted disobediently.<a name=104:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Wherever the principle of obedience is not in our hearts, all is wrong; there is nothing but sin.<a name=104:18></a> The principle which actuates us in our conduct should never be, "I must do what I think right"; but, "I ought to obey God," Acts 5: 29.<a name=104:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle then says, "Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly," verse 18.<a name=104:20></a> It is always the snare of those who are occupied with the things of God continually, not to have a "good conscience.<a name=104:21></a>" No person is so liable to a fall, as one who is continually administering the truth of God, if he be not careful to maintain a "good conscience.<a name=104:22></a>" The continually talking about truth, and the being occupied about other people, has a tendency to harden the conscience.<a name=104:23></a> The apostle does not say, "Pray for us, for we are labouring hard," and the like; but that which gives him confidence in asking their prayers is, that he has a "good conscience.<a name=104:24></a>" We see the same principle spoken of in 1 Timothy 1: 19; "holding faith, and a good conscience, which some having put away, concerning faith have made shipwreck.<a name=104:25></a>" Where there is not diligence in seeking to maintain a "good conscience," Satan comes in and destroys confidence between the soul and God, or we get into false confidence.<a name=104:26></a> Where there is the sense of the presence of God, there is the spirit of lowly obedience.<a name=104:27></a> The moment that a person is very active in service, or has much knowledge and is put forward in any way in the church, there is the danger of not having a good conscience.<a name=104:28></a>

		It is blessed to see the way in which, in verses 20, 21, the apostle returns, after all his exercise and trial of spirit, to the thought of God's being "the God of peace.<a name=105:1></a>" He was taken from them, and was in bondage and trial himself; he enters, moreover, into all the troubles of these saints, and is extremely anxious, evidently, about them; and yet he is able to turn quietly to God, as "the God of peace.<a name=105:2></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are called unto peace.<a name=105:3></a> Paul closes his second epistle to the Thessalonians with, "Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means.<a name=105:4></a>" There is nothing that the soul of the believer is more brought to feel than that he has "need of patience" (Hebrews 10: 36); but if he is hindered by any thing from finding God to be "the God of peace," if sorrow and trial hinder this, there is the will of the flesh at work.<a name=105:5></a> There cannot be the quiet doing of God's will, if the mind be troubled and fluttered about a thousand things.<a name=105:6></a> It is completely our privilege to walk and to be settled, in peace; to have no uneasiness with God, but to be quietly seeking His will.<a name=105:7></a> It is impossible to have holy clearness of mind, unless God be known as "the God of peace.<a name=105:8></a>" When everything was removed out of God's sight but Christ, God was "the God of peace.<a name=105:9></a>" Suppose then, that I find out that I am an utterly worthless sinner, but see the Lord Jesus standing in the presence of God, I have perfect peace.<a name=105:10></a> This sense of peace becomes quite distracted when we are looking at the ten thousand difficulties by the way; for, when the charge and care of anything rests on our minds, God ceases, practically, to be "the God of peace.<a name=105:11></a>"

		<a name=106>[Page 106]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are three steps:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1. The knowledge that God has "made peace through the blood of his cross," Colossians 1: 20.<a name=106:1></a> This gives us "peace with God," Romans 5: 1.<a name=106:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2. As it regards all our cares and troubles, the promise is, that, if we cast them on God, "the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep our hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.<a name=106:3></a>" See Philippians 4: 6, 7.<a name=106:4></a> God burdens Himself about everything for us, yet He is never disturbed or troubled; and it is said, that His peace shall "keep our hearts and minds.<a name=106:5></a>" If Jesus walked on the troubled sea, He was just as much at peace as ever; He was far above the waves and billows.<a name=106:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3. There is a further step, namely, He who is "the God of peace" being with us, and working in us to will and to do of His own good pleasure.<a name=106:7></a> See verses 20, 21.<a name=106:8></a> The holy power of God is here described as keeping the soul in those things which are well pleasing to Him, through Jesus Christ.<a name=106:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There was war -- war with Satan, and in our own consciences, but it met its crisis on the cross of the Lord Jesus.<a name=106:10></a> The moment that He was raised from the dead, God was made known fully as "the God of peace.<a name=106:11></a>" He could not leave His Son in the grave; the whole power of the enemy was exercised to its fullest extent; and God brought into the place of peace the Lord Jesus, and us also who believe on Him, and became nothing less than "the God of peace.<a name=106:12></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He is "the God of peace," both as regards our sins, and as regards our circumstances.<a name=106:13></a> But it is only in His presence that there is settled peace.<a name=106:14></a> The moment we get into human thoughts and reasonings about circumstances, we get troubled.<a name=106:15></a> Not only has peace been made for us by the atonement, but it rests upon the power of Him who raised up Jesus again from the dead; and therefore we know Him as "the God of peace.<a name=106:16></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The blessing of the saint does not depend upon the old covenant to which man was a party, and which might therefore fail; but upon God who, through all the trouble and sin and the power of Satan, "brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus," and thus secured "eternal redemption," Hebrews 9: 12.<a name=106:17></a> All that God Himself had pronounced as to judgment against sin, and all the wicked power of Satan, rested on Jesus on the cross; and God Himself has raised Him from the dead.<a name=106:18></a> Here then we have full comfort and confidence of soul.<a name=106:19></a> "Nothing can separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord," argues faith (see Romans 8: 31-39), for, when all our sins had been laid upon Jesus, God stepped in, in mighty power, and "brought again from the dead that Great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant.<a name=106:20></a>" The blood was as much the proof and witness of the love of God to the sinner as it was of the justice and majesty of God against sin.<a name=106:21></a> This covenant is founded on the truth and holiness of the eternal God having been fully met and answered in the cross of the Lord Jesus.<a name=106:22></a> His precious blood has met every claim of God.<a name=106:23></a> If God be not "the God of peace," He must be asserting the insufficiency of the blood of His dear Son.<a name=106:24></a> And this we know is impossible.<a name=106:25></a> God rests in it as a sweet savour.<a name=106:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=107>[Page 107]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, as to the effect of all this on the life of the saint, the knowledge of it produces fellowship with God and delight in doing His will.<a name=107:1></a> He "works in us," as it is said here, "that which is well pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ.<a name=107:2></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The only thing that ought to make any hesitation in the saint's mind about departing to be with Christ is the doing God's will here.<a name=107:3></a> We may suppose such an one thinking of the joy of being with Christ, and then being arrested by the desire of doing God's will here.<a name=107:4></a> See Philippians 1: 20-25.<a name=107:5></a> That assumes confidence in God, as "the God of peace," and confidence in His sustaining power whilst here.<a name=107:6></a> If the soul is labouring in the turmoil of its own mind, it cannot have the blessing of knowing God as "the God of peace.<a name=107:7></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The flesh is so easily aroused that there is often the need of the word of exhortation -- "I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation," verse 22.<a name=107:8></a> The spirit of obedience is the only spirit of holiness.<a name=107:9></a>

		BRIEF EXPOSITION OF THE EPISTLE OF JAMES
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		INTRODUCTION
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Epistle of James is not one in which the doctrines of grace are developed, although sovereign grace is clearly recognised; chapter 1: 18.<a name=108:1></a> These doctrines are presented to us under the form of the work of God in us, not under that of redemption through the precious blood of Christ, which is His work for us.<a name=108:2></a> It is a practical epistle -- the holy girdle for our loins, in order that the external practical life should correspond with the inner divine life of the Christian, and that the will of God should be for us a law of liberty.<a name=108:3></a> Redemption is not spoken of in this epistle, neither is faith, as the means of participation in the fruit of this accomplished redemption.<a name=108:4></a> But since many had already made profession of the name of Christ, the writer desires that the reality of this profession should be manifested by works, the sole witness to others that true faith is working in the heart; for faith works by love; Galatians 5: 6.<a name=108:5></a> James sets forth the true character of this new creation, and the way in which it is manifested in practical life, so that others are able to see it.<a name=108:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		James remained at Jerusalem to tend the flock which was found there -- more especially the Jewish portion of the church.<a name=108:7></a> We find him in the history of the gospel, but always as presiding over the Jewish flock, and that before it had become distinct from the Jewish nation.<a name=108:8></a> In the Epistle to the Hebrews the Spirit of God exhorts them to go forth without the camp, that is to say, to separate themselves from the unbelieving Jews; Hebrews 13.<a name=108:9></a> Up to that time they had remained together, and Christians offered sacrifices according to the law.<a name=108:10></a> There were also many priests who were obedient to the faith (Acts 6: 7) -- a thing incredible to us, but the fact is clearly proved by the word.<a name=108:11></a> Moreover they were still all zealous for the law.<a name=108:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us trace the history of James as we find it in the Acts.<a name=108:13></a> But first we get him specially mentioned in Galatians 1: 19, as having been seen by Paul, who, at that time, with the exception of Peter, had not seen the other apostles.<a name=108:14></a> Then we find him in Acts 15, presiding if we can so say, in the assembly of the apostles and elders, for deciding whether the Gentiles ought to be subjected to the law of Moses.<a name=108:15></a> His decision is final, though Peter and Paul as well as the other apostles were present, with the exception of James, the brother of John whom Herod had slain.<a name=108:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=109>[Page 109]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The decrees ordained by the apostles and elders were a testimony from the Jewish church.<a name=109:1></a> God had not allowed Paul and Barnabas to decide the question at Antioch: such a decision would not have ended the controversy; it would have made two assemblies.<a name=109:2></a> But the moment the Jewish Christians and the assembly at Jerusalem allowed liberty to the Gentiles, none could oppose themselves to their deliverance from the law.<a name=109:3></a> It was not a point determined by the apostles in virtue of their apostolic authority, although that authority confirmed the decree.<a name=109:4></a> They disputed much in the assembly.<a name=109:5></a> The decision is afterwards sent in the name of the apostles, the elders, and the whole church.<a name=109:6></a> Judaism had allowed to the Gentiles liberty from the Jewish yoke.<a name=109:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here again we find James.<a name=109:8></a> He ended the discussion by saying, "Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God.<a name=109:9></a>" It is not certain that he was an apostle.<a name=109:10></a> Probably he was not.<a name=109:11></a> He was at the head of the Jewish church at Jerusalem.<a name=109:12></a> For this reason the angel of the Lord, when he had brought Peter out of prison, restoring him to liberty, says, "Go and shew these things to James and to the brethren," Acts 12: 17.<a name=109:13></a> Again, at Antioch, "before that certain came from James, Peter ate with the Gentiles, but after they were come, he withdrew and separated himself," Galatians 2: 12.<a name=109:14></a> We see how James is linked in the minds of the Christians, including Peter, although an apostle, with the Jewish feeling that still held sway in the hearts of the Jewish Christians, especially at Jerusalem.<a name=109:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, when Paul went up to Jerusalem for the last time, "he went in," it is said, "with us to James, and all the elders were present," Acts 21: 18.<a name=109:16></a> James was evidently at the head of the assembly at Jerusalem, and expressed in his own person the strength of that principle of Judaism, which still reigned in the church at Jerusalem, God bearing with it in His patience.<a name=109:17></a> They believed in Jesus, they broke bread at home, but they were all zealous for the law.<a name=109:18></a> They offered sacrifices in the temple, and even persuaded Paul to do the same (Acts 21), and they were in no respect separated from the nation.<a name=109:19></a> All this is forbidden in the Epistle to the Hebrews, but it was practised up to the last days of Judaism.<a name=109:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=110>[Page 110]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This principle reappears in the Epistle of James -- a true presentation of the state of the Jewish Christians, James himself being in his own person its representative and embodiment.<a name=110:1></a> As long as God bore with the system, the Spirit of God could work in it.<a name=110:2></a> We learn from profane history that James was killed by the Jews amongst whom he bore the name of "the just"; and Josephus, the Jewish historian, tells us, that for this crime Jerusalem was destroyed.<a name=110:3></a> After the destruction of Jerusalem the system disappeared.<a name=110:4></a> We can well believe that the true Christians acted upon the testimony given in the Epistle to the Hebrews.<a name=110:5></a> However that may be, there remained only one or perhaps two small heretical sects, who held formally to Judaism, and they also soon vanished.<a name=110:6></a> They were called the Nazarenes and the Ebionites.<a name=110:7></a> But we need not occupy ourselves with these things.<a name=110:8></a>
	</div>

		The position of James, and the state of the assembly at Jerusalem (that is to say, of the Christians who were externally linked with the unbelieving Jews, although they might break bread and worship apart), makes it easier to understand this epistle.<a name=110:9></a> It is no question of its divine inspiration, but of its character.<a name=110:10></a> God in His goodness has given us all the forms with which Christianity has been clothed, and among others this first Jewish form, when the Christians had not yet separated themselves from the nation.<a name=110:11></a>

		We do not, therefore, here find the mysteries of the counsels of God, as in Paul; nor redemption as set forth in his writings, and in those of Peter; nor the divine life of the Son of God, in Him and then in us, as we find it described in the writings of the apostle John; but his subject is the practical life of the poor of the flock, who still frequented the synagogue, and denunciations against the rich unbelievers who oppressed the poor, and blasphemed the name of the Lord.<a name=110:12></a>

		The patience of God with His ancient people is here shewn, although James warns them that the Judge is before the door.<a name=111:1></a> He carefully distinguishes the believers (chapter 2: 1), though not yet separated from the people.<a name=111:2></a> Their privileges are not found in this epistle; they could not enjoy them in company with the unbelieving Jews; but he could point out to them -- though in the midst of such -- the difference of the Christian life, and it is of this James speaks.<a name=111:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		He does not style himself an apostle; yet he was in a practical manner -- not as an ordained elder, but from his personal influence, at the head of those Christians who were not separated from Judaism.<a name=111:4></a> He always thinks of Christians, and of the walk which became them in the midst of the nation.<a name=111:5></a> Peter, who wrote to a part of the Jewish dispersion, does not speak of the Jews, but calls the believers the nation, and addresses them as in the midst of the Gentiles (1 Peter 2: 10-12); but by James the Christian walk is described in terms which seldom go beyond what ought to have been found in a man of faith under the old covenant.<a name=111:6></a>

		We see that he has Christians in his mind, but Christians who are on the lowest step of the ladder which reaches towards heaven.<a name=111:7></a> Yet, since in point of fact, we are upon the earth, this epistle is most useful, as pointing out the walk and the spirit which become us, however great our heavenly privileges may be.<a name=111:8></a> Although the light of our hearts is there above, a lantern for our feet is not to be despised, and it is all the more valuable, because we are in the midst of a Christian profession -- of people who say they are believers.<a name=111:9></a> The epistle puts the truth of this profession to the proof.<a name=111:10></a> Whatever may have been the connection of the believers with the people, the writer of our epistle supposes faith in those to whom it is addressed -- a faith which perhaps might have been practically found in a Jew before he believed in Jesus -- therefore, with the addition of this belief, a true faith which had been produced by the word of God in the heart.<a name=111:11></a> As Paul himself, coming down from the height of the revelations granted him by God, recognises the faith of Lois and Eunice, and likens the faith of Timothy to that of these women.<a name=111:12></a>

		Let us now examine the epistle itself.<a name=112:1></a> At its very commencement, temptations, the discipline of God in favour of the believer, are the test of faith; chapter 1: 2-12.<a name=112:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to their position, they were associated with the people; the state of things which the writer has before his mind is a profession of the faith and knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=112:3></a> We shall see that he addresses others with whom they were found linked, and warns believers against the spirit in which such walked.<a name=112:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Jewish Christians were tried and persecuted.<a name=112:5></a> Peter also speaks of this in his epistle, encouraging them to suffer with patience.<a name=112:6></a> James exhorts them, as Paul also had done in Romans 5, to esteem persecution as all joy, and for the same reason that Paul had given.<a name=112:7></a> The trial of faith works patience; the will of man is broken; he has to wait for the operation of God; he feels his dependence on God, and that he lives in a scene where God alone can produce the result desired, overcoming and arresting the power of Satan.<a name=112:8></a> Often we may wish when occupied with good, that the work should be hastened, that difficulties should disappear, and that we should be freed from persecution; but the will of God -- not ours -- is good and wise: the works that are done upon the earth, He does them Himself Patience is the perfect fruit of obedience.<a name=112:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		See what is said in Colossians 1: 11: "Strengthened with all might, according to the power of his glory" -- what mighty deeds should not such strength produce!<a name=112:10></a> -- "unto all patience and longsuffering, with joyfulness.<a name=112:11></a>" All might, according to the power of His glory, is needed to enable us to bear everything without murmuring, and even with joy, since all comes from the hand of God.<a name=112:12></a> It is His will, not our own, which sustains the heart.<a name=112:13></a> When Paul, in 2 Corinthians 12: 12, gives us the signs of an apostle, the first is patience with all longsuffering.<a name=112:14></a> Paul also gives us the key to this apparent contradiction: "We rejoice in hope of the glory of God; and not only so, but we glory in tribulations also, knowing that tribulation worketh patience, and patience experience, and experience hope, and hope maketh not ashamed, because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which is given unto us," Romans 5: 3-5.<a name=112:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When the love of God is known, and the will broken, there is confidence in God.<a name=112:16></a> We know that all comes from Him, and that He makes all work together for our greatest blessing.<a name=112:17></a> Thus the trying of our faith works patience.<a name=112:18></a> But patience must have her perfect work: otherwise the will revives, also confidence in self, instead of having it in God.<a name=112:19></a> We act without God, and apart from His will, we do not wait upon Him, or in any case impatience and the flesh shew themselves in us.<a name=112:20></a> Job was subject for a long time, but patience did not have her perfect work.<a name=112:21></a> Saul waited long for Samuel, but he could not wait quietly till Samuel came, and he lost the kingdom.<a name=112:22></a> He did not wait for the Lord, conscious that he could do nothing of his own will, and apart from God: patience had not her perfect work.<a name=112:23></a>

		Now affliction, the dealing of God which acts for us externally, and inwardly too, by His grace, puts patience to the proof; and when this work is accomplished and we are wholly subject to God, desiring nothing apart from His will, we are perfect and entire, lacking nothing.<a name=113:1></a> Not that we have nothing to learn as to acquaintance with His will; we find the contrary in verse 5, which follows; but the state of soul is perfect, as to the will, as to our relations with God; and He can reveal His will to us, for it is the only thing we desire.<a name=113:2></a> See 1 Peter 1: 6, 7.<a name=113:3></a>

		There is, however, a second meaning to the word "temptation.<a name=116:1></a>" Though it often signifies trial from outward circumstances, it is also employed for another sort of trial -- that which comes from within, the temptation from lust, which is entirely different.<a name=116:2></a> God can try us externally, in order to bless us, and He does so.<a name=116:3></a> He tried Abraham, but He cannot in any way tempt by lust.<a name=116:4></a> When it is a question, not of putting obedience and patience to the test, but of sin, the condition of the soul is dealt with, for its correction and advancement.<a name=116:5></a> But as regards the calling forth of lust, it cannot be said that God tempts.<a name=116:6></a> "God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man, but every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.<a name=116:7></a>"

		With us there are temptations springing from the inner man, from lust, altogether different from the trials coming from without, which test the state of the heart, detecting selfwill, if we are not perfectly subject to the will of God, or if we are actuated by other motives besides His will.<a name=117:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now James is always practical.<a name=117:2></a> He does not search out the root of everything in the heart, as Paul does; he takes lust as the source which produces actual sin.<a name=117:3></a> Paul shews that the sinful nature is the source of lust -- an important distinction, which also illustrates the difference between the two writers, or the object of the Holy Ghost in the Epistle of James, namely, the outward practical life, as the evidence of the character of that life, which owes its origin to the word of God, that had wrought through faith.<a name=117:4></a> With James, lust -- the first movement of the sinful nature which discloses its real character -- having conceived, brings forth sin, and sin being finished, brings forth death.<a name=117:5></a> It is the history of the workings of the evil nature.<a name=117:6></a> James is occupied with its effects, Paul with its source, in order that we may know ourselves; Romans 8: 8.<a name=117:7></a>

		Then in opposition to lust, and shewing the action of God, which is not to tempt, but, on the contrary, to produce good, James tells us that "every good and perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.<a name=117:8></a> Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first-fruits of his creatures," verse 17, 18.<a name=117:9></a> As I have said, he owns grace as the sole and divine source of the good that is in us, as born of God, and that through faith, since it is by the word of truth.<a name=117:10></a> By it we are born again; it is a new life, and that by the will of God.<a name=117:11></a> We belong to the new creation; we are its first-fruits.<a name=117:12></a> Immense blessing!<a name=117:13></a> which belongs not only to a new position, though it is that, but also to a new nature which makes us capable of enjoying God.<a name=117:14></a> James does not speak of righteousness through grace, but of an entirely new nature, which comes from God.<a name=117:15></a>

		Thus, self-will being broken, and self-confidence destroyed, he exhorts us, as those who receive all from grace, to be willing to hear rather than to speak, to be slow to wrath, which is but the impatience of the old man, for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.<a name=117:16></a> He who is taught of God is subject to Him.<a name=117:17></a> He lays aside all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receives with meekness the ingrafted word.<a name=117:18></a> This is an important passage, for it presents the condition of the man of God, and that which acts upon him.<a name=117:19></a> The will of the flesh does not act in him, nor does self-will; he hearkens to what God says, he receives His [word] with meekness, and is subject to it.<a name=117:20></a> Then God engrafts the word in his heart.<a name=117:21></a> It is not knowledge merely, but the truth of God, His word which is able to save the soul.<a name=117:22></a> It is both the seed of the divine life, and that which forms it.<a name=117:23></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 2 believers are clearly distinguished; they are not to have the faith of the Lord of glory with respect of persons.<a name=120:9></a> To despise the poor was contrary to the law, which regarded all Israelites as objects of the favour of God, and considered the people as one before Him, each one being a member of the same family.<a name=120:10></a> It is also entirely contrary to the spirit of Christianity, which looks for humility, and calls the poor happy, which gives us to seek greatness in heavenly glory, shewing that the cross here answers to the glory above.<a name=120:11></a> Faith has seen that Lord of glory in humiliation, not having where to lay His head.<a name=120:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Moreover, the rich had, generally speaking, remained the adversaries of Christianity; they blasphemed that good name by which Christians were called; they drew them before the judgment-seats.<a name=120:13></a> God has chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which He has promised to them that love Him.<a name=120:14></a> Paul also gives the same testimony.<a name=120:15></a> Not many wise, not many mighty, not many noble, are called 1 Corinthians 1: 26.<a name=120:16></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		James contrasts the glory of the Lord, with the false glory of man in this world; for the fashion of this world passes away.<a name=121:6></a> He insists much on this point, as does Peter likewise.<a name=121:7></a> If they made a difference in the assembly between the poor and the rich, they became judges of evil thoughts.<a name=121:8></a> Blessed be God, we can live together for heaven and in heavenly things, at least in the church, where true difference consists, not according to the vanity of this world, but in degrees of spirituality.<a name=121:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Remark here, that the assembly is called the synagogue, shewing how the mind of James ran in Jewish habits of thought.<a name=121:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the fact that a difference was made between the rich and the poor, by which they were convinced of the law as transgressors, leads James to speak of the law.<a name=121:11></a> He speaks of three laws: the law of liberty, of which we have spoken; the royal law; and the law in its usual sense.<a name=121:12></a> The royal law is, "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.<a name=121:13></a>" He who does it does well.<a name=121:14></a> Then he adds a very important principle-that, if we have kept the whole law, and yet have failed in one point, we are guilty of all.<a name=121:15></a> The reason of this is simple.<a name=121:16></a> When lust has actuated us, we have transgressed the law, and have despised the authority of Him who established it.<a name=121:17></a> It is not supposed that a man has broken all the commandments in detail, but He who gave the one gave all, and where the flesh and the will in concert with it has been in activity, we have followed our own will, and despised the will of God.<a name=121:18></a> His will has been violated.<a name=121:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christianity requires that we should speak and act, as those who have been set free from the power of sin, to do the will of God in all things, His will being ours.<a name=121:20></a> He has delivered us from bondage; we are truly free to walk in the footsteps of Jesus.<a name=121:21></a> Precious and holy liberty!<a name=121:22></a> It is the liberty of a nature that finds its pleasure and joy in the will of God and in obedience.<a name=121:23></a> Now the Christian is always free to do the will of God; he may, indeed, get away from God, and through carelessness and unfaithfulness, lose strength and zeal; but still, all he says and does will be judged according to this law of liberty.<a name=121:24></a> Important truth!<a name=121:25></a> He grows in the knowledge of the will of God, and he is free under grace to practise what he knows.<a name=121:26></a> The needed strength is found in Christ.<a name=121:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=122>[Page 122]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To this thought of judgment James adds the necessity of walking according to grace.<a name=122:1></a> "He shall have judgment without mercy who hath shewed no mercy.<a name=122:2></a>" The Lord had already established this principle, that sins should be forgiven to him who forgives.<a name=122:3></a> If the spirit of grace is not in the heart, we cannot be sharers in that grace which God has manifested towards man.<a name=122:4></a> According to the government of God, he who does not act with mercy in the details of this life may taste the severe chastisement of God; for God finds His delight in goodness and in love.<a name=122:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now he insists upon works -- an important part of this epistle -- not that in itself it is more important than other parts, but it becomes so on account of the many reasonings of men.<a name=122:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The principle that love has to be shewn, not in words but in deeds, introduces the question of works.<a name=122:7></a> The spirit of James is practical; he is occupied with the evil produced by a profession of Christianity without a practical life in accordance with this profession; and the two principles -- that love should be real, and that faith should manifest itself by the works it produces -- are mingled in his observations.<a name=122:8></a> "If one of you say, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled, notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body, what doth it profit?<a name=122:9></a>" Certainly, this is not true Christian faith.<a name=122:10></a> Faith is a powerful principle, the result of the operation of the Holy Spirit in the heart, a spring which moves all the wheels of the heart, a principle which raises it above selfishness and all the base motives of the world, attaching its affections to Christ.<a name=122:11></a> Christ becomes our true motive; living in us, He is the source whence our actions flow, so that we walk as He walked.<a name=122:12></a> We are far behind Him indeed, but the principle of our life is the same; it is He Himself who lives in us.<a name=122:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is evident then that true faith works by love, and produces good deeds; it cannot be otherwise.<a name=122:14></a> But we have still another principle in this passage, which is expressed in the words, "shew me.<a name=122:15></a>" It is clear that faith is a principle hidden in the heart, it cannot be seen; even as the root which causes the plant to grow and bring forth fruit is not seen, though it draws nourishment from the soil, as faith draws from Christ.<a name=122:16></a> As without the root the plant cannot bring forth fruit, so without faith good works cannot be produced.<a name=122:17></a> Some things outwardly good may be done without having any value.<a name=122:18></a> Much may be given, much may be done, without true love, without faith; but a life of love which follows Christ, and does His will, because it is His will, not seeking anything else, cannot be without faith.<a name=122:19></a> Now the one who claims to possess faith owns that it alone is good, or can produce what is good.<a name=122:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=123>[Page 123]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		James therefore says: "Shew me thy faith without works.<a name=123:1></a>" But this is impossible.<a name=123:2></a> It is plain that it is a hidden principle in the heart, a simple profession without any reality: yet we need not always connect this with hypocrisy, because education, the influences which surround us, and external evidence, may produce as a habit of mind belief in Christianity, and its fundamental doctrines.<a name=123:3></a> But in such faith there is no link with Christ, no source of eternal life.<a name=123:4></a> A man may not be openly unbelieving, he honours the name of Christ, but such faith produces nothing in the heart: Christ cannot trust it.<a name=123:5></a> See John 2: 23-25.<a name=123:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When true faith, the effect of grace by the action of the Holy Spirit, is produced in the heart, there is felt at once a personal need of Christ, of possessing Him for oneself, of hearing His voice.<a name=123:7></a> We find this in the case of Nicodemus.<a name=123:8></a> He goes in search of Christ; and, mark well, he quickly feels that the world is against him, and so he goes by night.<a name=123:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, as true faith cannot be seen, he who claims to possess it, has nothing to reply to him who says, "Shew me thy faith.<a name=123:10></a>" But he who has genuine works of love cannot have them without faith, which is the divine motive power of Christian life in the heart, working patience, purity, love, and separation from the world, whilst walking through it.<a name=123:11></a> We cannot move without a spring.<a name=123:12></a> The faith which truly looks to Christ, and finds all in Him, manifests itself in this life, which is the life of faith.<a name=123:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a question of shewing faith, and to whom?<a name=123:14></a> To God?<a name=123:15></a> No surely.<a name=123:16></a> It is "shew me," that is, man who cannot see the heart as God sees it.<a name=123:17></a> The whole reasoning of James, all its force and meaning, is in this word, "Shew me.<a name=123:18></a>" He does not speak to us of peace of conscience, being justified by faith because the Lord, the beloved and precious Saviour has borne our sins, being given for our offences.<a name=123:19></a> Faith believes in the efficacy of the work of Christ, it knows that God has received it, has accepted it as a perfect satisfaction for the sins of believers, a work which will never lose its value in the sight of God, there where Christ is gone in, not without blood that is to say, His own blood, where He always appears in the presence of God for us, set down at His right hand, because the whole work as regards our sins was finished upon the cross, according to the glory of God.<a name=123:20></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here, on the contrary, James speaks of vain and empty faith of the profession of the name of Christ, of calling oneself a Christian, without having Christ in the heart: true faith shews itself by works, by fruit.<a name=124:1></a> It is seen from the fruit that the tree lives, that the root which draws its nourishment from Christ is there.<a name=124:2></a> The justification of the profession is made before men, to whom it must be shewn, by means of the fruits which are produced.<a name=124:3></a> When we closely examine the examples here given, we shall see plainly, that it is a question of the proofs of faith, not of good works in the ordinary sense of the term.<a name=124:4></a> Here faith is shewn by works in the same persons as those instanced by the apostle Paul: by the act of Abraham, who was ready to sacrifice his only and beloved son, when God required it of him; and by that of Rahab, who hid the spies and sent them away in peace, a witness of her faith.<a name=124:5></a> There can be nothing stronger than these instances.<a name=124:6></a> Not only was Isaac an only son, but in him all the promises of God were established, so that absolute confidence in God was called for.<a name=124:7></a> See Hebrews 11: 17-19.<a name=124:8></a> Humanly, there is nothing good in slaying a son.<a name=124:9></a> In like manner Rahab was a traitress, unfaithful to her country, if we think of her act as a natural one.<a name=124:10></a> But she linked herself with the people of God, when His enemies were in full power, and when His people had not as yet gained a single victory, or so much as passed the Jordan.<a name=124:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such is faith, which confides in God at whatever cost, and links itself with His people, when all is against them.<a name=124:12></a> Abraham's faith was simply faith in God and His word; but it was manifested absolutely, and without hesitation, when he offered up his beloved son, in whom all the promises were established.<a name=124:13></a> The faith of Rahab was also a simple faith in God, but it was displayed when she linked herself to the cause of God, when all the power was apparently on the other side: for God does not make Himself visible.<a name=124:14></a> In fact to call oneself a believer and to produce nothing, is not really faith.<a name=124:15></a> Faith realises its object, and the object produces its effect as a motive in the heart.<a name=124:16></a>

		He who receives the word, is born again of incorruptible seed, is a partaker of the divine nature, and obedience, purity and love are reproduced.<a name=125:1></a> We have, it is true, still to overcome temptations and difficulties; we are not what we wish to be, nor even what we might be: still, more or less, the life does produce its fruits.<a name=125:2></a> And though the heart may through carelessness be sometimes unfaithful in the path, faith, nevertheless, always produces its own proper fruits.<a name=125:3></a> The Christian well knows, that the faith which produces nothing, is not true faith.<a name=125:4></a> Faith realises the presence and the love of God known in the new nature -- it enjoys both, and reflects, though feebly, the character of Him in whom it inwardly delights.<a name=125:5></a> We are children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.<a name=125:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is from faith, though it be human faith, and not that of the inner divine life, that everything is done, that does not find its motive in the purely animal instincts of our nature.<a name=125:7></a> Why does the husbandman sow his seed?<a name=125:8></a> Because he believes it will produce a harvest: it is thus as to everything except eating and drinking.<a name=125:9></a> In order to have divine faith, it is needful that the things of God should be revealed to the soul; this is the work of the Spirit of God.<a name=125:10></a> Faith in God is that which is acceptable to God: but such faith, we being quickened of God through His word, brings forth the fruits of divine life.<a name=125:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		By means of this faith, we have fellowship with God, with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ our Lord; and He is not ashamed to call us His friends (John 15: 15); as Abraham was called the friend of God.<a name=125:12></a> In business with the world, we say what has to be said of the matter in hand, as courteously as we can; but this said, there is an end of it.<a name=125:13></a> With a friend, we open our minds, we speak of things that have no connection with business, of all that is in our hearts.<a name=125:14></a> God was not talking with Abraham of the promises made to himself, when he was called the friend of God; but He was telling him all His intentions as to the judgment of Sodom and Gomorrah.<a name=125:15></a> "The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him.<a name=125:16></a>" It is beautiful to see the intimacy of communion with God, when the walk is in faithfulness before Him.<a name=125:17></a> See Genesis 18: 17-20.<a name=125:18></a>

		The believer who was in Sodom was saved, though with the loss of everything; and he lived in disquietude and trouble, fearing the mountain where Abraham was (for the place of faith is always terrible to unbelief), fearing Zoar after he had seen the terrible overthrow of the other cities, and finally fleeing to the mountain of which he had been previously afraid, and living there in misery and shame.<a name=126:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have in Abraham the picture of a believer who lives by faith; in Lot, that of a believer who takes the world, beautiful to the outward eye, for his dwelling-place: he inherits judgment, though he was saved; whilst as for Abraham, after that Lot was separated from him, God told him to lift up his eyes and behold all the land of promise, to realise its extent and to know that all was his.<a name=126:2></a>

		CHAPTER 3
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		James would have humility in speaking, and that we should not be many teachers.<a name=126:6></a> When we do not know ourselves, it is far easier to teach others than to govern self.<a name=126:7></a> Now the tongue is the most direct index of what is in the heart.<a name=126:8></a> We all fail in many things and if we assume to teach others, our offences are the more serious, and all the more deserve condemnation.<a name=126:9></a> Humility in the heart makes a man slow to speak: he waits rather to be taught, and for others to express their thoughts; he is more ready to learn than to teach.<a name=126:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With this exhortation, James begins an important dissertation on the dangers of the tongue.<a name=126:11></a> No one can tame it, it is in fact as I have said, the most immediate index to the heart.<a name=126:12></a> "Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.<a name=126:13></a>" Many people do more with the tongue by hard speeches, than they would do with the hand.<a name=126:14></a> Besides, light and empty words are often spoken.<a name=126:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=127>[Page 127]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		James always desires that the will should be bridled, that we should not be self-confident, and that the lightness of the flesh should be held in check by the fear of God.<a name=127:1></a> And first, he would not have the Christian lightly put himself forward to teach, nor that there should be many teachers, knowing they would receive the greater condemnation.<a name=127:2></a> Love prompts to build up the brethren, and the Spirit leads the lowly in the exercise of their gifts.<a name=127:3></a> But it may be that a Christian likes to make himself heard, that he is not lowly, that he speaks because he has confidence in himself.<a name=127:4></a> Now this is not brotherly love, but rather love of self.<a name=127:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Moreover, we all fail in many things, and if we teach others, or at least assume to do so, we are clearly more responsible and our faults become more serious.<a name=127:6></a> How teach others, when we know not how to walk in faithfulness ourselves?<a name=127:7></a> This is not the fear of God.<a name=127:8></a> If the conscience is not good before Him, we cannot possibly set forth His grace and truth in His power, for we are not in His presence and He is not with us.<a name=127:9></a> The first effect of His presence would be to arouse the conscience.<a name=127:10></a> He who teaches ought to maintain true and deep humility, and to watch that he may not stumble in his path.<a name=127:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such a spirit of humility is not lack of confidence in God; it is on the contrary linked with this confidence.<a name=127:12></a> The humble one will not say to the Lord: I know thee that thou art a hard man.<a name=127:13></a> But he has no confidence in self, he speaks only when it is the will of God; then he speaks in the power of His Spirit.<a name=127:14></a> He is slow to speak, he waits for God, that he may do it with Him.<a name=127:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Some other important truths are connected with these words.<a name=127:16></a> And first, we all offend in many things.<a name=127:17></a> He who calls himself perfect deceives himself.<a name=127:18></a> This does not necessarily mean that we commit any scandalous offences, but we do and say what is wrong in the sight of God.<a name=127:19></a> Our speech is not always with grace, seasoned with salt: failure is found in it.<a name=127:20></a> We cannot excuse ourselves, for the Lord has said, "My grace is sufficient for thee, my strength is made perfect in weakness," nevertheless we fail, sad as it is, and we are compelled to own it, if we are walking with God; grace will make us feel and own it, and we shall walk more closely with Him, with more watchfulness and lowliness, and in greater realised dependence upon Him.<a name=127:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=128>[Page 128]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But we find yet another truth in these words.<a name=128:1></a> The exhortation would not have been needful, had not the liberty to speak, when God willed it, belonged to all the brethren according to their gift, and according to the direction of the word, since such directions are found in it.<a name=128:2></a> If one person had been appointed to speak, such an exhortation would have been quite useless.<a name=128:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus there is a moral exhortation to humility, quietness, distrust of self, and the fear of God; for the danger of offending and our responsibility are spoken of.<a name=128:4></a> The passage also excludes any thought of ministry by one person only in the assembly.<a name=128:5></a> It is not here questioned that a single individual may exercise a ministry which God has confided to him -- on the contrary, such a ministry is permitted to any to whom the Lord has imparted the needful gift -- only under the direction of the word.<a name=128:6></a> The activity of the flesh is rebuked, and the liberty of the Holy Ghost is set forth.<a name=128:7></a> The Lord makes use of each one as seems good to Him; whether by those permanent gifts of teacher, pastor, and evangelist, which are to continue with us to the end, or by the ministry of each member in the place where God has set it.<a name=128:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now what is said as to offending, leads to a continuation of the discourse concerning the tongue; that most direct index to the heart, which is so easily set in motion, and which follows every impulse of the heart.<a name=128:9></a> All things, even wild beasts and serpents, have been tamed; but the tongue can no man tame, it is full of deadly poison.<a name=128:10></a> This is very strong, but alas!<a name=128:11></a> it is very true: nevertheless, let us remember that if the flesh is practically held for dead, and we are living by the Spirit, the tongue will become the expression of His impulses, or there will be silence, because grace has nothing to say.<a name=128:12></a>

		Many according to the flesh would avoid giving a blow, who cannot restrain a passionate or hard word against a neighbour.<a name=128:13></a> But if no man can restrain the tongue, the grace of Christ can do it, for the inner man on one side is under the yoke of the Lord, and is meek and lowly in heart: Christ fills the heart, and thus precisely because the tongue follows the impulses of the heart, the speech will express this meekness and lowliness.<a name=128:14></a> For this, it is needful that Christ alone should dwell there, and the flesh be so held in check, that when temptation comes it may not stir.<a name=128:15></a> It is difficult not to fail, but it is very useful to see that the tongue shews what is working within, just as the hands of a clock shew the hidden workings of its wheels.<a name=128:16></a>

		Such is the beautiful portrait of divine wisdom.<a name=129:1></a> It is well to note how James always desires that self-will should be silent, in order that we may be capable of doing the will of God, and, as partakers of the divine nature, of manifesting His character -- the character of Christ, God manifest in flesh.<a name=129:2></a> He came not to do His own will, but the will of Him that sent Him.<a name=129:3></a> He ever submitted Himself even to wrongs and injustice, doing good and walking in calmness and love.<a name=129:4></a> To do well, to suffer, and take it patiently, this (says Peter) is acceptable to God.<a name=129:5></a> Love is free when self is dead.<a name=129:6></a> We walk in peace, we make peace, and the fruits of righteousness in peace are sown for them that make peace.<a name=129:7></a> (It is thus I understand these few words.<a name=129:8></a>) "Blessed are the peace-makers; for they shall be called the children of God.<a name=129:9></a>" It is a reproduction, in the walk of a man, of the peace and love of God as it was manifested in Christ down here.<a name=129:10></a>

		CHAPTER 4
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having commended the spirit of peace in the Christian's ways, James now asks, "From whence come wars and fightings among you.<a name=129:11></a>" But here we must inquire what is meant by "among you.<a name=129:12></a>" It is not necessarily among Christians.<a name=129:13></a> Meekness of wisdom, wisdom that is gentle and easy to be entreated, became them.<a name=129:14></a> But, as we have seen, they found themselves still in the midst of the twelve tribes, who are, I doubt not, included in this "among you.<a name=129:15></a>" And the Christians might find themselves implicated in these disputes, so that the exhortation is addressed to them also.<a name=129:16></a> These fightings came from their pleasures; the will was unbroken, lust distracted their hearts; they desired to have what they did not possess; conscience was silent, overpowered by lust, and the desires (unchecked by the will) gave the rein to the passions: "Ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain; ye fight and war, and yet ye have not.<a name=129:17></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Dependence on God was forgotten; will acted for itself; they did not ask of God, or if they asked, it was but with the desire to make God Himself the servant of their pleasures.<a name=129:18></a> God does not respond to such prayers.<a name=129:19></a> Sad state of man!<a name=129:20></a> God was forgotten, and still worse, the heart was the slave of pleasure, and under the yoke of its passions, far from peace and quietness: war within, and open sin without, afar from God in the world -- this passing scene in which such desires find their sphere -- or, at least, if God was known, He was forgotten by their rebellious hearts.<a name=129:21></a> Therefore the friendship of the world is enmity with God.<a name=129:22></a> Such a Christian, conformed to the world, forgets that he is purged from his old sins.<a name=129:23></a> He walks in forgetfulness of God, in the path of the unbeliever, and conscience retreats driven back by lust.<a name=129:24></a> When he asks of God he does not receive, because he asks, as a worldling might, to spend it on his pleasures.<a name=129:25></a>

		We need not suppose that all those whom James calls "adulterers and adulteresses" were actually such.<a name=130:1></a> Many were really such sinners in the world; and others, even though Christians, walked in the same spirit of unfaithfulness to God, and gave the rein to their pleasures, walking with the world.<a name=130:2></a> This, surely, is not the path of the Christian; but when he abandons the ways of God and finds himself mixed up with the world, he is often ashamed of his Christianity, he dares not confess the Saviour's name.<a name=130:3></a> Then conscience becomes hardened, and thus he becomes like the world or worse, having overleaped every barrier.<a name=130:4></a> Satan rejoices then to see the name of Christ dishonoured by those who bear it.<a name=130:5></a>

		Now a principle of great importance is found in this passage, "The friendship of the world is enmity with God; whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.<a name=130:6></a>" Powerful testimony!<a name=130:7></a> which judges the walk and searches the heart.<a name=130:8></a> The world's true character has now been manifested, because it has rejected and crucified the Son of God.<a name=130:9></a> Man has been already tried without law, and under law, but after he had shewn himself to be wholly evil without law, and had broken the law when he had received it, then God Himself came in grace; He became man in order to bring the love of God home to the heart of man, having taken human nature.<a name=130:10></a> It was the final test of man's heart.<a name=130:11></a> He came not to impute sin to them, but to reconcile the world to Himself.<a name=130:12></a> But the world would not receive Him; and it has shewn that it is under the power of Satan and of darkness.<a name=130:13></a> It has seen and hated both Him and His Father.<a name=130:14></a>

		The world is ever the same world: Satan is its prince; and all that is in it, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but of the world.<a name=130:15></a> The heart of man, the flesh, has since the fall been always enmity against God.<a name=130:16></a> It is often thought and said that, since the death of Christ, Satan is no longer the prince of this world; but it was precisely then that he declared himself as its prince, leading on all men, whether Jews or Gentiles, to crucify the Saviour.<a name=130:17></a> And although men now bear the name of Christ, the opposition of the world to His authority remains the same.<a name=130:18></a>

		Only observe and see if the name of Christ is not dishonoured.<a name=131:1></a> Man may indeed be taught to honour it, but it is none the less true that where he finds his enjoyment, where his will is free, he shuts out Christ, lest He should come in and spoil his pleasures.<a name=131:2></a> If left alone, he does not think of Him; he does not like to be spoken to of the Saviour, he sees no beauty in Him that he should desire Him.<a name=131:3></a> Man likes to do his own will, and he does not want the Lord to come and oppose it; he prefers vanity and pleasures.<a name=131:4></a>

		We have the true history of the world and its practical principles in Cain.<a name=131:5></a> He had slain his brother, and was cast out of the presence of God, despairing of grace and refusing to humble himself.<a name=131:6></a> By the judgment of God, he was made a vagabond on the earth; but such a condition did not suit him.<a name=131:7></a> He settled down where God had made him a vagabond, and he called the city after the name of his son to perpetuate the greatness of his family.<a name=131:8></a>

		That this city should be deprived of all the delights of life would have been unbearable; therefore he multiplied riches for his son.<a name=131:9></a> Then another member of the family invented instruments of music; another was the instructor of artificers in brass and iron.<a name=131:10></a> The world being cast out from God sought to make its position pleasant without God, to content itself at a distance from Him.<a name=131:11></a> By the coming of Christ the state of man's heart was manifested, not only as seeking the pleasures of the flesh, but as being enmity against God.<a name=131:12></a> However great His goodness, it would not be disturbed in the enjoyment of the pleasures of the world, nor submit itself to the authority of another; it would have the world, for itself, fighting to obtain it, and snatching it from the hands of those who possessed it.<a name=131:13></a> Now it is evident that the friendship of this world is enmity with God.<a name=131:14></a> As far as in them lay, they cast God out of the world, and drove Him away.<a name=131:15></a> Man desires to be great in this world; we know that the world has crucified the Son of God, that it saw no beauty in the One in whom God finds all His delight.<a name=131:16></a>

		James again insists on humility; that man's will should be broken, and that he should be subject to God.<a name=132:4></a> For obedience, and having no will of one's own, is true humility; and to this the goodness and grace of God invites man.<a name=132:5></a> Confidence in God leads the soul to submit itself to Him.<a name=132:6></a> This is both a duty and a necessity, but it is done heartily where confidence exists.<a name=132:7></a> It is the truth of our relationship with God, and the soul is happy.<a name=132:8></a> We do not need to have a will for ourselves; if God who loves us has a will for us in all things, we ought to commit ourselves to Him.<a name=132:9></a> What grace that the omnipotent God should be always thinking of us in all the details of our lives!<a name=132:10></a>

		Another important principle is found at the end of this chapter.<a name=137:4></a> Man's own will is always evil.<a name=137:5></a> Where there is the knowledge of good, the heart, or at least the state of man is evil, if he does it not.<a name=137:6></a> Grace and love are lacking.<a name=137:7></a> To seek self-interest, to do one's own will, to satisfy one's own desires, characterises the natural man.<a name=137:8></a> To do good, to seek the good of others, and to serve them, is the fruit of love.<a name=137:9></a> Now, if, when there is the knowledge of what is good, and the opportunity of doing it occurs, man does it not, it is a sign that the heart is evil; love for others, and the desire to do good is lacking.<a name=137:10></a> Not to do good is sin; it shews the absence of grace and the activity of the natural will.<a name=137:11></a>

		CHAPTER 5
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The portion of believers is not in this world.<a name=138:1></a> Christ has won them for Himself, that they should be in His likeness in glory, co-heirs with Him; for His love would have them enjoy all that He Himself enjoys.<a name=138:2></a> His love is perfect.<a name=138:3></a> But if so, they must suffer with Him.<a name=138:4></a> If it is given to us to suffer for Him, it is a great privilege, but it is not the portion of all.<a name=138:5></a> Nevertheless all who will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution; 2 Timothy 3: 12.<a name=138:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But it is impossible to escape suffering with Him; if we have the Spirit of Christ, we feel as Christ felt.<a name=138:7></a> Holiness suffers at the sight of the sin which is around, and in seeing the condition of the church of God and of His people; besides which there is sorrow on all sides, and the need of souls who will not have Christ or salvation.<a name=138:8></a> Each one ought to take up his cross, and besides this, God permits us to suffer, because in so doing, we learn patience, and that our inheritance is not below.<a name=138:9></a> Experience, which is the realisation of practical truth, is confirmed in the heart, and hope becomes much clearer and stronger.<a name=138:10></a> This, it is true, supposes that the love of God is shed abroad in the heart by the Holy Ghost; and if this is not the case, God allows suffering, and also sends it, to renew the heart.<a name=138:11></a> He chastens whom He loves.<a name=138:12></a>

		James addresses the rich, who have possessions in this world, and who do not consider the poor, whilst "blessed is the man that considereth the poor," Psalm 41: 1.<a name=138:13></a> He who despises the poor because of his poverty despises the Lord Himself.<a name=138:14></a> "As for me," says the Lord, in the psalm preceding the one from which I have quoted, "I am poor and needy," Psalm 40: 17.<a name=138:15></a> The Lord had pronounced His blessing upon the poor; to such the gospel was preached; it was a sign announcing the Messiah.<a name=138:16></a> We all know that a poor man may be just as wicked as any other; but riches are a positive danger for us, because they nourish pride, and tend to dispose the heart to keep aloof from the poor, with whom the Lord associated Himself in this world.<a name=138:17></a> "He who was rich for our sakes became poor, that we through his poverty might be rich.<a name=138:18></a>"

		But here the rich had been foremost in evil.<a name=139:1></a> They oppressed the poor, they kept back from them the wages for which they had laboured.<a name=139:2></a> James places us in view of the last days.<a name=139:3></a> The cry of the poor had entered into the ears of the Lord of hosts.<a name=139:4></a> He exhorts the rich to weep and howl for the miseries that should come upon them.<a name=139:5></a> They had lived in pleasure on the earth and been wanton.<a name=139:6></a> But not only this: when we live in pleasure, we do not like anyone to come and disturb our happiness -- they had condemned and killed the Just, who had not resisted.<a name=139:7></a> They wished to secure the enjoyment of the world in a false tranquillity, which thinks neither of God, nor of judgment, nor of death.<a name=139:8></a>

		God does not for the present alter the course of this world.<a name=139:10></a> If He did so, He must execute judgment, instead of working in love for the ungodly and sinners.<a name=139:11></a> He is not willing to smite them, nevertheless He is not slack concerning His promise, but is longsuffering to usward, not willing that any should perish.<a name=139:12></a> The Christian then must take courage, must be patient and submissive to outward evil, until the coming of the Lord; even as Christ Himself, who did well, and suffered, and waited patiently; thus the Christian should walk in His steps.<a name=139:13></a> Our portion is not in this world.<a name=139:14></a> If we suffer for well-doing, this is acceptable to God, and still more so, if it is for Christ Himself that we suffer.<a name=139:15></a>

		The life of the Saviour was all suffering and patience; but now He is glorified with God the Father.<a name=139:16></a> Soon He will come a second time into the world, in the glory of the Father, and in His own glory, and in the glory of the angels; and then He will be glorified in His saints, and will be admired in all them that believe.<a name=139:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In that glorious day, when the poorest of His own -- Christians, oppressed by the enemies of the truth -- will be like the Lord Himself in glory, we shall make our boast in having been permitted to suffer for Him, and in having maintained patience and silence through the unjustly imposed sufferings of the Christian life.<a name=139:18></a> Then, "blessed are they who are found watching; he will gird himself, and will make them sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them.<a name=139:19></a>" What joy!<a name=139:20></a> What grace!<a name=139:21></a> It will be the glory of the Saviour Himself to give us to enjoy the blessings of heaven in the Father's house, ministering all with His own hands.<a name=139:22></a> It is well worth while to suffer for Him a little, and for a little while, and then to possess heavenly blessing, communicated by the hand and the heart of Jesus Himself.<a name=139:23></a> We shall reign with Him, and enjoy the fruit of the work which we have been permitted to do for Him; if it is only a cup of water given in the name of Jesus, it shall not lose its reward.<a name=139:24></a> But far better still will it be to sit down in peace, enjoying those eternal blessings in the Father's house, which Christ will abundantly minister to us -- precious testimony of His approval and of His love.<a name=139:25></a> See Luke 12: 35-44.<a name=139:26></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Remark here how the coming of Christ was a present hope.<a name=140:1></a> The oppressed one was to have patience until that coming.<a name=140:2></a> "Be patient," says James, "until the coming of the Lord.<a name=140:3></a>" Some one may say, then they were deceived.<a name=140:4></a> By no means.<a name=140:5></a> We may indeed die before the Lord's coming, and in fact, we know that these saints did die.<a name=140:6></a> But they will reap all the fruits of their patience, when the Lord comes.<a name=140:7></a> And till that moment they are with the Lord -- absent from the body, present with the Lord -- and they will come with Him, and will then enjoy all the fruit of those sufferings, in which they had been patient, for the love of His name, seeking to glorify it down here.<a name=140:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But this exhortation clearly shews how this hope was a present thing, which was interwoven with the entire thread of Christian life.<a name=140:9></a> It was not a theory in the head, a point of acquired knowledge, or a dogma of belief only.<a name=140:10></a> They expected the Lord in person.<a name=140:11></a> What consolation for the poor and the oppressed!<a name=140:12></a> What a check upon the rich to be constantly expecting the Lord!<a name=140:13></a> To know that He will soon come, that troubles will cease, and that we shall be with Him who has loved us!<a name=140:14></a> Nothing produces separation from the world like waiting for the Lord -- I do not say the doctrine of His coming, but true waiting for Him.<a name=140:15></a> His coming will separate us from it for ever; the heart waits until He come.<a name=140:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord's supper expresses the Christian state -- the Lord's death at His first coming, which we celebrate with thanksgiving, remembering Him who has loved us, and feeding on His love until He comes to take us to be with Him.<a name=140:17></a> It is the formal expression of the practical state of the Christian as a Christian -- of Christianity itself.<a name=140:18></a> Let us add, that it is by the Holy Spirit alone that we are able to express this in truth.<a name=140:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=141>[Page 141]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But remark yet another thing in this exhortation.<a name=141:1></a> "Be patient, brethren.<a name=141:2></a>" We are always waiting for the Lord, if we really understand our position; but whatever may be our desires, we cannot command the Lord to come, nor know when He will come.<a name=141:3></a> And blessed be His name!<a name=141:4></a> the Lord is patient; as long as there is yet one soul to be called by the gospel, He will not come.<a name=141:5></a> His whole body, His bride, must be formed; every member must be present, converted and sealed by the Holy Spirit.<a name=141:6></a> Then He will come and take us.<a name=141:7></a> Christ Himself is seated on the Father's throne, not on His own throne.<a name=141:8></a> He also is waiting for that moment, with more desire surely than we are; and therefore the patience of Christ is spoken of: this is the true meaning of Revelation 1: 9.<a name=141:9></a> Thus also in Revelation 3: 10, "because thou hast kept the word of my patience"; also in 2 Thessalonians 3: 5, "the patience of Christ.<a name=141:10></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are taught also in Hebrews 10: 12, 13, that Christ is seated at the right hand of God, waiting till His enemies shall be made His footstool.<a name=141:11></a> We may well wait if Christ is waiting; but we wait in suffering and conflict.<a name=141:12></a> He is waiting to reign, and then He will cause full blessing to flow forth for His own, whether in heaven or on earth, and will banish evil from both.<a name=141:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we need patience, that neither self-will nor weariness of the conflict should take possession of our souls; but in the confidence that the time God wills is best (for it is that which divine wisdom and His love for us have ordained) let us fix our affections on the Lord and on things above, because we wait for Him with desire of heart, with broken will, and unwavering faith, leaving His return to the decision of God.<a name=141:14></a> In fact we cannot retard it, but the heart has entire confidence in His love, assured that the Lord waits for us with greater love than we for Him, calm in confidence, patient in the wilderness journey.<a name=141:15></a> How sweet to wait for Christ -- for the fulness of joy with Him!<a name=141:16></a> Thanks be to God, He says, "it is at hand.<a name=141:17></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Moreover, James draws two practical consequences from this expectation of the Lord.<a name=141:18></a> First, then we ought not to resist evil; the Just One did not resist.<a name=141:19></a> We must wait with patience, as the husbandman waits for the precious fruits of the earth, until he have received the early and the latter rain, the means which God uses to bring the fruit of harvest to perfection.<a name=141:20></a> The Christian should stablish his heart by this expectation, while passing through the troubles of this life, and the persecutions of the world, which is ever the adversary of the Lord.<a name=141:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=142>[Page 142]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next, he warns the disciples against walking in a complaining and quarrelsome spirit, one toward another.<a name=142:1></a> If we are waiting for the Lord, the spirit is calm and contented, it does not get irritated with its persecutors; moreover, we bear with patience the ills of the desert, and resist evil as Christ resisted, suffering, and bearing wrongs and committing Himself to God.<a name=142:2></a> We are contented and quiet, with a happy and kindly spirit, for kindness flows easily from a happy heart.<a name=142:3></a> The Lord's coming will put everything right, and our happiness is found elsewhere.<a name=142:4></a> This is what Paul says in Philippians 4: 5: "Let your moderation be known unto all men.<a name=142:5></a> The Lord is at hand.<a name=142:6></a>" Let us repeat it.<a name=142:7></a> How real, how mighty and practical, was this expectation of the Lord!<a name=142:8></a> What power it had over the heart!<a name=142:9></a> "The Judge standeth before the door.<a name=142:10></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then he gives examples.<a name=142:11></a> The prophets were examples of suffering affliction, and of patience, and they counted them happy in their sufferings.<a name=142:12></a> And they have not been alone; others also have endured, and have been counted happy.<a name=142:13></a> For example, if we see one suffering unjustly for the name of Jesus, and he is patient and meek, his heart called out on behalf of his persecutors, rather than irritated against them, then we recognise the power of faith, and of confidence in the love and faithfulness of the Lord; he is calm and full of joy, and we say, See how grace makes that man happy!<a name=142:14></a> And we too are happy when we suffer; at least, we ought to be so.<a name=142:15></a> But it is one thing to admire others who are sustained by the Spirit of Christ, and another to glory in tribulations, when we are in them ourselves.<a name=142:16></a> We need a broken will, confidence in God, communion with Him who has suffered for us, in order to be able to glory in sufferings.<a name=142:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Job is another example; but he is introduced here, to shew the end of the Lord, that He is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.<a name=142:18></a> Yet the example is most instructive.<a name=142:19></a> Job was a perfect and upright man, who feared God and eschewed evil; but he had begun to take pleasure in himself; he did good, but he was occupied with his goodness; it was hidden self-righteousness, but it marred his piety.<a name=142:20></a> God withdraws not His eyes from the righteous.<a name=142:21></a> He saw Job's danger, and drew Satan's attention to him.<a name=142:22></a> It was God who began all.<a name=142:23></a> Satan, the accuser of the saints, insists that Job should be sifted, and God permits him to tempt Job, to do as he would with him, but sets a limit to his malice.<a name=142:24></a> Satan did all that he was allowed to do, and Job remained subject, and did not sin with his lips.<a name=142:25></a> Satan persists in his accusations, insinuating that, if the trial were increased, Job would curse God.<a name=142:26></a> God gave all into his hand except Job's life.<a name=142:27></a> Job remained faithful; he did not sin; he had received good at the Lord's hand, and should he not receive evil?<a name=142:28></a> His wife also tempted him in vain.<a name=142:29></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Through grace Job's patience triumphed over Satan, who was unable to shake him.<a name=143:1></a> Through the grace of God, the efforts of the enemy were overcome: "We have heard of the patience of Job.<a name=143:2></a>" But the work of God for Job's blessing was not yet accomplished.<a name=143:3></a> He had by His grace sustained Job's heart against the enemy, and Job had shewn his faithfulness.<a name=143:4></a> Satan, as the instrument of God's ways, had done much through the sorrow he had brought upon Job; but Job's heart was not yet reached; he did not know himself; on the contrary, although the preparation had been wrought by means of Satan, Job was, by the grace of God, practically justified from his accusations, and if the matter had ended there, his state would have been worse than before -- at least he would have been in greater danger than ever; he could have said, I was meek and upright in prosperity, and now patient in adversity.<a name=143:5></a> God must do His work, in order that Job might know his own heart.<a name=143:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Job's friends come to see him.<a name=143:7></a> They remain seated, amazed at the condition in which they find him.<a name=143:8></a> Alas!<a name=143:9></a> pride is often roused in the presence of man, and wounded pride irritates the heart; firmness gives way in the presence of sympathy.<a name=143:10></a> However that may be, the presence of his friends lays bare the depth of Job's heart.<a name=143:11></a> He curses the day of his birth.<a name=143:12></a> Now his heart is laid bare, not only to God, which it always must be, but -- which is so deeply painful -- to himself.<a name=143:13></a> Where is now his gracious meekness?<a name=143:14></a> He contends with God; he says he is more righteous than God.<a name=143:15></a> Nevertheless it is beautiful to see that at the bottom of his heart he had just thoughts of God.<a name=143:16></a> If I could meet Him, he says to his friends, He would not be like you, He would put words into my mouth.<a name=143:17></a> His friends alleged this world to be a perfect display of God's government, and that consequently Job must be a hypocrite; for he had made a profession of piety.<a name=143:18></a> Job resists this unjust decision, and insists that, although the hand of God was occasionally manifested, yet evil often ran its course in the world, God taking no notice of it, for the wicked often prospered.<a name=143:19></a> But Job allowed the bitterness of his heart to come out.<a name=143:20></a> Elihu reproves him for making himself more righteous than God, shewing that there is indeed a government of God over His own.<a name=143:21></a> He withdraws not His eyes from the righteous; He chastens because He loves them.<a name=143:22></a> Then God manifests Himself, and shews Job the folly of contending with Him; upon which Job owns his vileness and his nothingness, and instead of saying, "When the eye saw me, it blessed me," he says, "Mine eye seeth thee, therefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.<a name=143:23></a>" He knows himself in the presence of God.<a name=143:24></a> After that God was able to bless him, and He did so more than at the first.<a name=143:25></a> This was "the end of the Lord.<a name=143:26></a>" Job had been patient under the greatest afflictions and trials; God searched his heart, and then abundantly blessed him.<a name=143:27></a>

		In verse 12 James continues the subject which forms the burden of his teaching.<a name=144:1></a> He will not have the will to act, nor the flesh to appear, but the activity of nature restrained, and the heart learning not to give way to those impulses of impatience to which it is so prone.<a name=144:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When a man swears, he allows this impatience of the heart to act; he forgets the glory and majesty of God, irreverently introducing His name with unbridled flesh to confirm an assertion, or to give force to a vow, or in His place he puts some creature whom he invests with the authority and power that belongs to God alone.<a name=144:3></a> The root of all is the unsubdued will and unbridled passions of man's heart.<a name=144:4></a> Only, with an intuitive sense of his impotency to ensure the fulfilment of his desires, he irreverently brings God in, or, as a heathen of old was wont to do, he introduces some creature practically deified for the occasion.<a name=144:5></a> It is not lust, but the unbridled impetuosity of the flesh (see Colossians 3: 8), the irreverence, presumption, and independence of the man carried to its utmost extent.<a name=144:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Therefore James says, "Above all things.<a name=144:7></a>" He would have us, in calmness and quietness, affirm what we have to say with a yes or a no, in the fear of God.<a name=144:8></a> It is of all importance, that we should hold in check the movements of nature.<a name=144:9></a> We should do it if we saw God before us; we should certainly do it in the presence of a man whom we wished to please.<a name=144:10></a> Now God is always present; therefore, to fail in this calmness and moderation is a proof that we have forgotten the presence of God.<a name=144:11></a>

		"Be careful for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known unto God.<a name=145:12></a> And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus," Philippians 4: 6, 7.<a name=145:13></a> Paul is speaking here of cares, but comfort and rest are equally found there in affliction.<a name=145:14></a> "Who comforteth us," says the apostle, "in all our afflictions," and he appeals to God as "the Father of mercies and the God of all consolation.<a name=145:15></a>" At Philippi they were filled with peace, through the consolation poured into their hearts.<a name=145:16></a> This may also be through circumstances; for Paul says, "God, who comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus," 2 Corinthians 7: 6.<a name=145:17></a> He had been utterly cast down, because he had not met Titus, who had been sent to the Corinthians when they were walking very badly.<a name=145:18></a> He had abandoned the open door for the gospel at Troas, and his heart had even gone the length of regretting that he had written his first inspired epistle.<a name=145:19></a> His faith had sunk below the level of the power of God, which had impelled him to write it.<a name=145:20></a> Arrived in Macedonia, still on his way to meet Titus, though testifying to Christ as he went, his flesh had no rest; he says, "We were troubled on every side; without were fightings, within were fears.<a name=145:21></a>" God allowed the apostle to feel his weakness; but it is worth while to be afflicted, if God Himself becomes our comforter.<a name=145:22></a> Titus arrives bringing good tidings to the effect of his first epistle, and the apostle is full of joy.<a name=145:23></a> God often takes away the affliction itself and fills the soul with gladness, pouring His consolations into the heart which thus becomes more matured for communion with Himself and for heaven.<a name=145:24></a> In every case of affliction prayer is our resource; we own our dependence and we confide in His goodness.<a name=145:25></a> The heart draws near to Him, it tells out to Him its need and its sorrow, laying it down on the throne and the heart of God, who answers either by circumstances which make us happy, or by pouring in His consolation -- an answer which is still more blessed than outward happiness -- but ever by that which is best for us, acting according to His perfect love.<a name=145:26></a>

		The pious heart, under the influence of grace, refers also to God in its joy.<a name=146:1></a> If the heart dwells only on the cause of its joy, this becomes a danger for it.<a name=146:2></a> But if God is a refuge in distress, so is He the portion of the soul in joy.<a name=146:3></a> When I have a subject of happiness, I tell my intimate friend, that he may rejoice with me, and this doubles my own joy.<a name=146:4></a> But in this passage there is something more; for the heart feels that God is the source of the blessing and the cause of the joy.<a name=146:5></a> Even when there is no special reason for rejoicing, the heart is happy, and the pious soul, living in communion with God, desires to have God with it in its joy.<a name=146:6></a> Moreover, if the soul gives itself up to joy, it becomes empty and light; the heart gets estranged from God, and folly takes possession of it.<a name=146:7></a> In trouble dependence upon God is realised, but in joy there is a danger of forgetting it, and joy often ends in a fall; at any rate, the flesh is then in activity, and God is forgotten.<a name=146:8></a> This exhortation of James, to mingle joy with piety, is therefore most important for the Christian.<a name=146:9></a>

		If the thought of God is there, it expresses itself in psalms and thanksgivings to Him.<a name=146:10></a> God is present to us in our joy, and faith, communion, and spiritual power are increased by the sense of His goodness.<a name=146:11></a> Thus we apply ourselves to the toils of life, encouraged and strengthened through the sorrows of the wilderness, by a deeper conviction that God is for us.<a name=146:12></a>

		Verse 14.<a name=147:1></a> The thought of affliction and joy leads James to another condition of the Christian, namely, sickness, which is often, though not always, the effect of the Lord's chastening.<a name=147:2></a> Sickness, as well as death, came in by sin; and we find it now throughout the whole course of man's history.<a name=147:3></a> But a sparrow falls not to the ground without God our Father, as the Lord says, and although these ills now belong to the natural condition of man, yet God uses them for the correction of His children.<a name=147:4></a> "He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous," Job 36: 7.<a name=147:5></a> In either case, whether as ills natural to humanity, or the direct chastisement of God, God now makes use of sickness, when the heart, instead of considering all that happens to it with indifference, draws near to God, who thinks upon the sufferings of His own, and has respect to the submission and to the cry of those whom He chastens.<a name=147:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The prayer of faith heals the sick, and if the sickness is the consequence of sin, the sin which occasioned it shall be forgiven; the sufferer has owned the hand of God in his sickness, and God answers to the faith of him who prays.<a name=147:7></a> There are two kinds of forgiveness in the ways of God.<a name=147:8></a> Eternal justification -- according to Romans 4 and Hebrews 10 -- is the blessed portion of those who believe in the efficacy of the blood of Christ; that is to say, their sins are imputed to them no more.<a name=147:9></a> "Whom he called, them he also justified; and whom he justified, them he also glorified.<a name=147:10></a>" God took up the question of their sins at the cross, and He has made an end of them for ever; He will never remember them again.<a name=147:11></a> But there is also the government of God -- the government of a Father, but of a holy Father who loves His children too well to allow them to walk badly.<a name=147:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When in the book of Job Elihu says that God withdraws not His eyes from the righteous, and shews the blessing which naturally flows from His favour, the effect of His goodness, he immediately goes on to speak of chastening -- an explanation clearly of Job's case.<a name=147:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Spirit of God here again supposes the possibility of such a case, speaking of my faults.<a name=147:14></a> But it is not always so.<a name=147:15></a> In Job 33 it is said that God speaks and seals their instruction, that He may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man.<a name=147:16></a> He prevents the evil, as in Paul's case; 2 Corinthians 12.<a name=147:17></a> He humbles man to prepare him for blessing.<a name=147:18></a> In every case He makes all things work together for good to those who love Him; Romans 8: 28.<a name=147:19></a>

		Now, if the will be not broken, we complain, and murmur, and lift ourselves up against God; but if the heart refers to Him, owning His hand, whether in suffering which is the natural heritage of sinful man (though it can never be apart from the hand and will of God), or in positive chastisement, or again, though it may not know why the suffering is sent, it turns to God, owns that its condition is the result of His will, and seeks the remedy in His grace, as subject to and dependent on His power and His will.<a name=148:1></a> Now the faith of true Christians alone can call down from above the answer and the blessing.<a name=148:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		James no longer speaks of the synagogue, but of the assembly.<a name=148:3></a> There must be true faith, in order for blessing: now God has set blessing in the assembly of true believers; in His government and discipline it is found there for faith.<a name=148:4></a> When sin is openly manifested in such a way, that it can be said of one called a brother that he is a wicked person, it is the duty of the assembly to put him away from among themselves.<a name=148:5></a> The sins are bound upon the one who is thus put away.<a name=148:6></a> But if he humbles himself, and from the bottom of his heart owns his sin, then the assembly ought to restore him (2 Corinthians 2); in this administrative sense, the sinner is pardoned, the bonds are loosed.<a name=148:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And this is valid for two or three who are gathered to the name of Christ in the unity and in the power of the Holy Ghost (Matthew 18); for it is by the Spirit alone that this can be done in reality.<a name=148:8></a> It must be done also by the assembly as such, not only because the promise belongs to it, but also that it may clear itself.<a name=148:9></a> It is to the assembly that the exhortation of 2 Corinthians 2: 7, 8, is addressed.<a name=148:10></a> The sanction of this solemn act is in the presence of Jesus according to His promise.<a name=148:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In this passage in our epistle, it is not a question of sins which draw upon the individual the judicial action of the assembly, but of the ways of God Himself, in the ordinary circumstances of life, and more especially as regards the chastening of God.<a name=148:12></a> Now the individual seeks the intervention of God, according to His grace, not viewing what has befallen him as an accident, but owning the hand of the Lord.<a name=148:13></a> The assembly is the place where He has set His name, and His blessing, and the general administration of His grace.<a name=148:14></a> Christ is there; and when the assembly was in order, the elders, those who watched over it, were sought by the sick person, in order that he might enjoy the grace and the blessing of God.<a name=148:15></a>

		Nevertheless it was personal faith, which by prayer drew down the special blessing of heaven -- "the prayer of faith," as it is said.<a name=149:1></a> The elders were but a sign of the special intervention of God, as we see in Mark 6: 13.<a name=149:2></a> There it was a miracle performed by those who were specially sent by Christ to do them, with power given for that purpose.<a name=149:3></a> Here it is the blessing of God in the bosom of the assembly, administered through its elders, if faith was there.<a name=149:4></a> The original order now exists no longer; but Christ does not forget His assembly.<a name=149:5></a> The promise of two or three gathered to His name, according to the unity of His Spirit, remains always sure; and if there is faith in those who watch over them, the answer of God will be found in a like way.<a name=149:6></a> Though we cannot expect that the blessing should flow in its natural current, when the channels are broken and spoiled, the case remains the same, and His power is unchangeable.<a name=149:7></a> It is precious to know it!<a name=149:8></a> When the Lord rebukes the disciples for their unbelief, He says at the same moment, "bring him to me": and the child was healed; Mark 9: 19.<a name=149:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Therefore James recalls the example of Elijah, who was a man of like passions with ourselves; yet in answer to his prayer it rained not for three years and six months.<a name=149:10></a> The external order of the assembly is lost, but the power, love, and faithfulness of the Lord are unchanged.<a name=149:11></a> He may let us feel that, through the sin of the assembly, we are not as we were at the beginning: nevertheless, where God gives faith, the answer on His part will never fail.<a name=149:12></a> That is not godliness, which does not feel the loss that has come upon us since the time of the apostles, through the unfaithfulness of the assembly; neither is it godliness to doubt the power of Christ, if God gives faith to make use of it.<a name=149:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When it is said, "if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him," it means, that when such a brother has come to himself, owning the hand of God, if sins have drawn upon him the chastisement of God, and have hindered the healing of the sickness, they shall be forgiven as regards the discipline of God in His government.<a name=149:14></a> This discipline had manifested itself in the chastening, that is to say, in the sickness: if this is removed, the discipline is ended, the sins are remitted.<a name=149:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But here we find another and more general instruction, which, however, also depends upon the state of the assembly.<a name=149:16></a> We have seen that, when all was in order, the sick person was to send for the elders; and this can still be done by calling for those who practically are elders.<a name=149:17></a> Only it is needful that faith wrought of God, and those acting on His part, should be there.<a name=149:18></a> But, whatever may be the state of ruin in which the assembly of God is found, we can always confess our faults one to another, and pray for one another, that we may be healed.<a name=149:19></a> This does not require the existence of official order, but it supposes humility, and brotherly confidence, and love.<a name=149:20></a>
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We cannot indeed confess our faults without confidence in a brother's love.<a name=150:1></a> We may choose a wise and discreet brother (instead of opening our hearts to indiscreet persons), but this choice alters nothing as to the guilty person's state of soul.<a name=150:2></a> Not hiding the evil, but opening his heart, he frees his troubled conscience; perhaps also his body.<a name=150:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Truth is wrought in the heart; the guilty one does not seek a good reputation -- which after all, can only be a false one -- but an upright conscience, upright before God.<a name=150:4></a> God takes pleasure in setting the conscience at liberty; He also frees the body from the sickness if necessary; then the heart grows happy in the sense of His favour.<a name=150:5></a> A pure and upright conscience is a source of joy in God's presence.<a name=150:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is most important to remember that there is a government of God with respect to His children.<a name=150:7></a> It is no question whether they are justified and forgiven; for this government supposes that they are righteous in His right, as to salvation; Job 36.<a name=150:8></a> But then the Lord ever keeps His eye upon them, blesses them, and makes them conscious of His favour when they are walking aright in the enjoyment of God.<a name=150:9></a> But if we do not walk aright, we are warned, and if we do not take heed to the voice of God, He chastens in order to arouse the soul that is falling asleep and has begun to forget God.<a name=150:10></a> And His goodness, His wondrous patience, His love for us, are never weary!<a name=150:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 19.<a name=150:12></a> Finally, James adds an exhortation to encourage our hearts to seek the blessing of others.<a name=150:13></a> He who brings back a sinner from the error of his ways is not only the means of saving that soul, whether it be a sinner walking in his sins, or a Christian walking badly, but also of hiding a multitude of sins.<a name=150:14></a> That the soul of an unconverted man should be saved is simple; in the case of a Christian pursuing an evil way, he is at least arrested in the road which leads to perdition.<a name=150:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But this second point calls for a little more explanation, and it is not without importance.<a name=151:1></a> Sin is hateful in the sight of God; He sees everything.<a name=151:2></a> When we think of the state of the world, we understand how wonderful is His patience.<a name=151:3></a> Now the conversion of a sinner removes all his sins from before the eyes of God.<a name=151:4></a> As though they were cast into the depths of the sea, He sees them no more; as it is written.<a name=151:5></a> They are immediately cancelled.<a name=151:6></a> It is in this sense that "love covereth a multitude of sins.<a name=151:7></a>" They are no longer there as an object hateful to God.<a name=151:8></a> If we do not forgive the sins of a brother, the enmity remains before God as a wound in the body of believers, something that is not healed.<a name=151:9></a> When forgiven, love is the object that presents itself before God -- a thing pleasing to His heart.<a name=151:10></a> Thus when the sinner is converted -- brought back, the love of God finds its pleasure in this, and the offending object is removed from His sight.<a name=151:11></a>

		In the Epistle of James we find but little doctrine; it is rather the girdle of righteousness, the manifestation of faith in works, in the Christian character.<a name=151:12></a> Submission under the hand of God, and patience under His government, are developed in a way most useful to the Christian.<a name=151:13></a>

		NOTES ON THE EPISTLE OF JAMES
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		James addresses his epistle to the twelve tribes of Israel; but whilst owning the people that are beloved for the fathers' sake, he takes the ground of faith.<a name=152:1></a> "James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes.<a name=152:2></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		At the time this Epistle was written, the gospel, which was first preached in Judea, had produced great results amongst the Jews; many churches had been formed, multitudes of Jews had believed (Acts 21: 20), and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith; Acts 6: 7.<a name=152:3></a> In those early days the believing Jews still held to the old order of things, they were zealous of the law and some even offered sacrifices.<a name=152:4></a> Jerusalem itself was in a peculiar position; through the bringing in of Christianity and on account of the faith entrusted to the holy city at this the starting-time of the gospel, she was under fresh responsibility.<a name=152:5></a> But this privilege was lightly esteemed of her children, and was about to pass from her hands into those of the Gentiles.<a name=152:6></a> In the midst of these circumstances James, though having chiefly the believers in view, nevertheless writes his Epistle to the twelve tribes, the whole of Israel, giving a last warning before God severed the church from the Jewish system.<a name=152:7></a> James does not deal with Israel as Paul, who, when in conflict with the synagogue, would separate the disciples from it and at a distance continue the work of the gospel in favour of the Gentiles.<a name=152:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is even a noticeable difference between the two apostles of the circumcision, namely, Peter and James, in the way in which they look upon Israel in their Epistles.<a name=152:9></a> Peter is occupied chiefly with the faithful remnant and views it in those who, among the Jews, had received the faith; he sees Israel only in this remnant, whilst James takes in the whole of the nation.<a name=152:10></a> Doubtless the faithful remnant therein comprised is the only living portion wherein the great truths of faith and life are realised, still James writes to the whole people.<a name=152:11></a> He looks upon the nation as under the favour of the promises of God, then being presented in the gospel.<a name=152:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to doctrine, the Epistle of James sets forth as much as any other the great truths of the gospel of God; but it goes no farther than the first elements; we do not get unfolding of truth as in Paul.<a name=152:13></a> Nevertheless it does not follow that the things written in James are of less absolute authority.<a name=152:14></a> For instance, what more positive than this statement -- "Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creature?<a name=152:15></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=153>[Page 153]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When reading these elements of the gospel, we are surprised at not finding therein all that the Spirit of adoption has revealed to us; but let us acknowledge that such unfoldings do not come within the scope of the Epistle, and moreover that the condition of those to whom it was written did not admit of such.<a name=153:1></a> If this Epistle does not shew all the riches of the revelation of the gospel, yet is it none the less useful as a girdle of righteousness, as a voice of warning which keeps the conscience awake.<a name=153:2></a> It requires that the faith and life of the Christian should be visible to the eyes of men by these effects.<a name=153:3></a> The Epistle of James is simple enough when we understand the circumstances of Christians in the midst of the Jews in those days when Christianity was not yet defined in all its points.<a name=153:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The level it maintains is that which may have been the moral state of the faithful in all ages; namely, God known by them according to His eternal truth, either outside or above the particular characteristics which the various revelations of Himself impressed upon them.<a name=153:5></a> Dispensations have differed, they have brought out in succession various characteristics of God; but God in Himself does not alter.<a name=153:6></a>

		CHAPTER 1
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verses 2-15.<a name=153:7></a> From the outset James lowers man, he puts him in a place of dependence upon God, he sees him submitted to the trial of faith.<a name=153:8></a> But trial works its results; it bears the fruit of patience; it leads to the prayer of faith; it causes us to value a low degree, and lastly, makes us worthy of the crown of life which the Lord hath promised to them that love Him.<a name=153:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 4.<a name=153:10></a> "But let patience have her perfect work.<a name=153:11></a>" Patience sustains and enables us to wait according to God for the issue of the trial, without availing ourselves of speedy deliverance out of it, suggested by the flesh.<a name=153:12></a> For instance, Saul was not able to wait patiently.<a name=153:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 5.<a name=153:14></a> "Let him ask of God.<a name=153:15></a>" When trial comes the first resource of the Christian, as also the first motion of the new man, is prayer.<a name=153:16></a> God always hears the prayer of His saints.<a name=153:17></a> Thus strengthened from above, the Christian is enabled to go through the trial in the spirit of obedience.<a name=153:18></a> In Gethsemane Christ prayed before being in the trial; then in obedience He took the cup from the Father's hand.<a name=153:19></a> If we neglect prayer and the difficulties come upon us unawares, we enter into temptation and we fall.<a name=153:20></a> Peter slept when he should have prayed, drew the sword when he should have submitted, denied Jesus when he should have confessed Him.<a name=153:21></a> God "upbraideth not.<a name=153:22></a>" God gives without reproaching our state.<a name=153:23></a>

		Verses 12-15.<a name=154:6></a> Trial (or temptation) may come to us from two sources: from God, when heart and faith are tested -- "God tempted Abraham"; from the adversary when it reaches us through lust, and flesh is allured.<a name=154:7></a> How much better is it to have to do with God in the trial than with Satan!<a name=154:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Whoever knows himself will pray, "Lead us not into temptation.<a name=154:9></a>" May the grace of God so work in us that we may not need to be sifted by Satan in order to be stripped of our pretensions.<a name=154:10></a> When Jesus prayed for Peter, whom He knew to be self-confident, He did not ask that His disciple might be spared the sifting of the enemy, but only that his faith should not fail him.<a name=154:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 15.<a name=154:12></a> "When lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin.<a name=154:13></a>" Paul speaks in the inverse order in his Epistle to the Romans; chapter 7: 8.<a name=154:14></a> "Sin wrought in me all manner of lust.<a name=154:15></a>" The difference between these two statements is this: Paul confines himself to spiritual principles; whilst James desires to shew their effects.<a name=154:16></a> One completes the other; sin, in the nature of man produces lust (Romans 7), and lust produces sin in the conduct; James 1.<a name=154:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verses 16-18.<a name=154:18></a> The Epistle of James acknowledges regeneration by the power of the grace of God, even as it owns also faith in Jesus (chapter 2: 1) -- two fundamental truths of the gospel.<a name=154:19></a> "Begat he us with the word of truth," 1 Peter 1: 23-25; John 3.<a name=154:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"That we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.<a name=154:21></a>" God will reconcile all things to Himself; His creation and His elect.<a name=154:22></a> We, the begotten of the Father, are the firstfruits of that reconciled creation.<a name=154:23></a> In a certain sense, Adam after his sin may be said to have been the firstfruits of fallen creation.<a name=154:24></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 21.<a name=155:5></a> "The engrafted word.<a name=155:6></a>" As a graft becomes an integral part of the subject into which it is engrafted, so the word becomes a part of the Christian.<a name=155:7></a> This is not the case with a law which remains a command outside of us.<a name=155:8></a> Let the word produce its effect in us, still its authority over us remains, an authority which is of God.<a name=155:9></a> The word builds up, enjoins, or condemns, as the case may be.<a name=155:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 25.<a name=155:11></a> "The perfect law of liberty.<a name=155:12></a>" In James, the divine nature in us is always seen to be in perfect conformity to the law of God.<a name=155:13></a> That nature loves what God enjoins.<a name=155:14></a> When it so happens that the person to whom a command is made desires to do the thing commanded, he is pleasing himself whilst obeying the command.<a name=155:15></a> Such is the law of liberty.<a name=155:16></a> We see it exemplified in Christ; in order to attempt the hindrance of His liberty, it would have been necessary to impede His obedience.<a name=155:17></a> So it is with the divine nature in the Christian, it is always free, that is to say, ready to do the will of God.<a name=155:18></a> The conflict of the Christian does not destroy this truth, the principle in such case being "I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.<a name=155:19></a>"

		READING ON 1 PETER 1 and 2
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Peter is only laying the foundation here; you do not get anything of the proper subject of his Epistle until "Dearly beloved, I beseech you," in chapter 2.<a name=159:1></a> In each Epistle he lays the foundation of redemption.<a name=159:2></a> They give the government of God that the Jews were put under.<a name=159:3></a> "He that will love life and see good days," that is not redemption for heavenly glory.<a name=159:4></a> Or, again, "The eyes of Jehovah are over the righteous, and his ears are open to their prayers.<a name=159:5></a>" As far as I have seen, the first Epistle is government in favour of saints, telling them they will suffer, and so on; and the second is government in respect of the wicked.<a name=159:6></a> In this chapter he tells first of redemption, and then how judgment begins at the house of God.<a name=159:7></a> And it is very instructive as to the order of the revelations and dealings of God.<a name=159:8></a> It is addressed to the scattered Jews through Pontus, etc.<a name=159:9></a>: "sojourners of the dispersion" it really is.<a name=159:10></a> "Will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles?<a name=159:11></a>" is the same.<a name=159:12></a> They are Christians, converted Jews, though scattered, before the destruction of Jerusalem.<a name=159:13></a> Peter was put to death before Jerusalem was destroyed, according to common chronology.<a name=159:14></a> You never find anything about the church as a body in Peter, but as a house.<a name=159:15></a> Paul alone speaks of it as the body of Christ; this was his special ministry.<a name=159:16></a> Peter does address them in their new standing, but it is individually in accomplished redemption, not as in the one body united to Christ.<a name=159:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		At the end "the church that is at Babylon," I doubt.<a name=159:18></a> "Elected" is in the feminine, and no word is given for "church" at all; many have thought it refers to Peter's wife -- a sister.<a name=159:19></a> Only Paul touches the subject of the body of Christ, and so he alone speaks of the rapture.<a name=159:20></a> There is in John's Gospel, "I will come again, and receive you unto myself," but nothing more.<a name=159:21></a> As to the house it is in chapter 2.<a name=159:22></a> They were converted or Christian Jews, elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father; it was any quickened soul among the dispersion.<a name=159:23></a> Peter was specially the minister of the circumcision.<a name=159:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		James writes on a larger scale.<a name=159:25></a> He says "the twelve tribes," and he talks about anyone coming into their "synagogue"; it is like a national body, but he singles out those who are believers.<a name=159:26></a> And he says "twelve," though ten are in captivity; this is faith.<a name=159:27></a> Like Paul, "Unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to come"; and like the twelve stones of Elijah at Carmel.<a name=159:28></a> He could say "instantly," as it was so, though they were doing it very ignorantly and badly; just as Paul himself had been doing when he was Saul.<a name=159:29></a> All really honest Jews were doing so.<a name=159:30></a> They might have done it in a bigoted way; still they were serving.<a name=159:31></a> Just as you may have a church so-called kept open night and day, it is kept open whatever may be there beside the truth itself.<a name=159:32></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Peter goes farther than that; he takes up the sanctification of the Spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ.<a name=160:12></a> "Jesus Christ" applies to both those.<a name=160:13></a> Is it the obedience of Jesus Christ instead of the law?<a name=160:14></a> No; I take it, the obedience of Jesus Christ is not merely that there is a rule given, but rather His own.<a name=160:15></a> "Lo, I come to do thy will, O God.<a name=160:16></a>" There is a whole life which has no spring of action except the will of God; and if there was no will of God, He did nothing.<a name=160:17></a> At the beginning the Lord says, as it were, to Satan, "I am come to live by the word of God.<a name=160:18></a>" He could have turned the stones into bread, of course, but He had no will of God for it, and so He did nothing.<a name=160:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two characters of it -- obedience such as Christ's, and confiding dependence (or dependent confidence, if you like).<a name=160:20></a> "Through sanctification of the Spirit" means that the Holy Ghost has wrought in us to put us apart for these two things.<a name=160:21></a> You are elect to both, but the way by which you are brought into them is by "sanctification of the Spirit.<a name=160:22></a>" Thus the Holy Ghost has come and taken man out of the flesh altogether, and put him into this place.<a name=160:23></a> And then these two things are, if you please, His life and His death.<a name=160:24></a> It is a different kind of obedience from that of an obedient child now; my child wants to run out, and I say, "Sit down, and do your lesson.<a name=160:25></a>" Well, he does so, and that is very pleasant and right.<a name=160:26></a> But Christ never obeyed thus, He never wanted to be stopped; He says "I came not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.<a name=160:27></a>" In 2 Thessalonians 2 you get "sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth" together -- the same thing pretty much.<a name=160:28></a>

		You must begin practical sanctification by setting me apart first.<a name=161:1></a> The Holy Ghost comes, and sets us apart to God, separated out of the flesh to obedience.<a name=161:2></a> It is not so much the fact of the new life, as it is that the word has wrought in me; "being born of the word of God that liveth and abideth for ever.<a name=161:3></a>" In Hebrews sanctified by the blood of the covenant is another aspect of sanctification.<a name=161:4></a> Here the Spirit is the one who brings it into actual operation.<a name=161:5></a> In "by the which will we have been sanctified," you get that which sets us apart judicially; but the direct action of God at all times is by the Holy Ghost.<a name=161:6></a> So we are born of the Spirit; there is a new life communicated, the Holy Ghost giving me a renewed mind, bringing that into me, whereby my thoughts and feelings are all changed.<a name=161:7></a> It is God's purpose to set me apart by the Spirit.<a name=161:8></a> God's purpose is in His own mind, and God gave His Son that we may be, in a redemption way, set apart to Him.<a name=161:9></a> But we all the while are still sinners.<a name=161:10></a> Then comes the Holy Ghost, who operates in us, and sets us actually apart.<a name=161:11></a> Sanctification of the Spirit is actual operation.<a name=161:12></a> All the working of God is by the Spirit.<a name=161:13></a> We are born of the Spirit, born of the Father in one sense, and the Son quickens whom He will.<a name=161:14></a> And the Holy Ghost still operates, for He takes the word, and He makes the children grow.<a name=161:15></a>

		Sprinkling is the application of blood, in opposition to what we had under law.<a name=161:16></a> There was a certain sanctification of Israel to God, but not by the Holy Ghost, and they had the blood of sprinkling in a way; but it is Christ's blood that we are sanctified to, and not that of bulls and goats.<a name=161:17></a> Obedience comes first, because you get the actual thing that I am sanctified to -- the obedience of Christ.<a name=161:18></a> But if I am to be before God, it must be by His blood; the one is for cleansing, and the other is His life.<a name=161:19></a> It is general, but more the person that is in view, because the blood has been put upon the mercy-seat, and this made God approachable.<a name=161:20></a>

		A person could not walk practically in the path of obedience without the sprinkling of the blood; we should not be set apart to God at all without it.<a name=162:12></a> It is in contrast with Judaism, where, as a matter of fact, they were brought through the Red sea, and so separated from Egypt.<a name=162:13></a> Here it is the Holy Ghost that does it, and it is a real thing in the soul.<a name=162:14></a> In Hebrews you do not get the sanctification of the Spirit at all, though you get holiness; they are sanctified by blood, and are warned not to fall away.<a name=162:15></a> Where there was faith, they, of course, had the actual value of it all; and where it is individual, it says, "perfected for ever.<a name=162:16></a>" It is a great thing to take our verse up absolutely and simply.<a name=162:17></a> Here am I set apart to have no will at all, only God's; obedience is not having a will of my own, and that is the law of liberty.<a name=162:18></a> Just as if I told my child again to go off and play in the street, he would go off, and be obedient in doing so, but it would be what he liked to do.<a name=162:19></a> Here, He says, I am bringing you out of a sinful world, where the carnal mind is enmity against God, and I set you apart to do my will in the world, and nothing else.<a name=162:20></a> And then comes the second blessed thing, all the value of Christ's blood.<a name=162:21></a>

		That is the true character of the obedience of Jesus Christ, and of ours as Christians.<a name=176:1></a> The other may be needed for us -- the stopping us in our own will; but the true character of our obedience, and that which characterises the whole life of the Christian is this -- that the will of God, of our Father we can say, is with us, as it was with Christ, our reason, our motive, for doing a thing.<a name=176:2></a> When Satan came and said to Him, "Command that these stones be made bread," He answers, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.<a name=176:3></a>" His actual life as carried out in conduct flows from the word of God which is His motive for doing it; and if He has not that, He has no motive.<a name=176:4></a> You will find that it alters the whole tenor and spirit of a man's life.<a name=176:5></a> We have to be stopped in our own will, that is true, because we have the old nature in us; but it alters the whole spirit and tenor of a man's life.<a name=176:6></a> If I have no motive but my Father's will, how astonishingly it simplifies everything!<a name=176:7></a> If you never thought of doing a thing except because it was God's positive will that you should do it, how three-quarters of your life would at once disappear!<a name=176:8></a> This is the truth practically as to ourselves; yet we clearly see that such was the obedience of Christ.<a name=176:9></a>

		2 Peter 1: 4
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Far from bringing into Godhead, which is incommunicable as supreme, because we are creatures, I do not even accept a common expression from Romanists and others -- union with God.<a name=204:1></a> But the moral elements of what He is God can communicate in giving us life in Christ.<a name=204:2></a> Nature is properly what makes any creature what it is, as "angel," "man," "cow," or anything else.<a name=204:3></a> 2 Peter 1: 4 is not the simplest and clearest passage to explain the point, because it is properly moral, that is, specially what characterises the Christian as such.<a name=204:4></a> The reason I think so is, that it speaks of great and precious promises, which to me mean what John 3 calls "born of water," and "ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.<a name=204:5></a>" Still it is not separable from the other point, life-giving.<a name=204:6></a> But it speaks of promises, and escaping corruptions which are in the world.<a name=204:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This truth of being born again, even Romanists, and also Arminians, and most evangelicals admit and confine themselves to, that is, an action of the Holy Ghost by the word by which man is morally purified.<a name=204:8></a> Nay, Wesleyans would say that it may be regained; and even those who do not go so far still hold it as only a purifying of what is.<a name=204:9></a> The Wesleyans say that man had body, soul, and spirit before the fall, and after the fall body, soul, and spirit corrupted; that, when one is born again, the corruption is removed; and hence that one may be quite perfect as man, if the corruption be wholly removed.<a name=204:10></a> But, without touching on perfection now, this is, to say the least, a most defective view of the matter.<a name=204:11></a> The Lord is a life-giving Spirit; and, operating by the Holy Ghost, "that which is born of the Spirit is spirit" -- not <i>the Spirit</i>, who is God; but one is by His divine power quickened, just as that which is born of the flesh is flesh.<a name=204:12></a> I receive spiritually life from Christ, as I receive naturally life from Adam.<a name=204:13></a> In this sense Christ is my life.<a name=204:14></a> He is eternal life (1 John 1), and "he that hath the Son of God hath life.<a name=204:15></a>" It is not I as of the flesh, but Christ lives in me.<a name=204:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence, viewed abstractedly as thus born (for so John views things), it is said he cannot sin, because he is born of God.<a name=204:17></a> And this life we have in the power of Christ's resurrection; and it is acted in by the Holy Ghost given to us because of Christ's work.<a name=204:18></a> So after His resurrection, as God breathed into Adam so Christ breathed into His disciples.<a name=204:19></a> Through this it is said, "the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.<a name=204:20></a>" A great accessory truth that comes in connected with this is, that, Christ having died, I am counted (Colossians 3) of God dead as to the flesh, and am to count myself so (Romans 6), and to realise it (2 Corinthians 4), so that only the life of Christ should be manifested.<a name=204:21></a> This is the point to which my soul clings on the subject, the real communication of life in receiving Christ, by the power of the Holy Ghost acting in it in power, created again in Christ Jesus, though the flesh still be there.<a name=204:22></a> But I am not in flesh but in Spirit, and am privileged and bound to hold it dead.<a name=204:23></a> Of course, this does practically cleanse by and according to the word.<a name=204:24></a> One may not be able to explain it physiologically, but it is quite plain in Scripture; and in Spirit the saint will live eternally with God.<a name=204:25></a> "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit" -- partakes of the nature of that of which it is born.<a name=204:26></a> It is holy, loves, and, as in Christ as a man, obeys.<a name=204:27></a> In a word it is the reproduction as to its nature of Christ's life.<a name=204:28></a> "If Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; the Spirit is life because of righteousness.<a name=204:29></a>" It is as new a thing as a graft in a wild tree.<a name=204:30></a>

		NOTES ON THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		CHAPTER 1
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The great leading truth of all this Epistle is what is expressed in verse 1, that eternal life has come down -- a real positive life.<a name=207:1></a> The eternal life that was with the Father actually entered this world in the Person of Christ.<a name=207:2></a> The old thing -- what the first Adam was -- is entirely rejected.<a name=207:3></a> It is true, we have both in us as long as we are in the body.<a name=207:4></a> But there is the second Man, the Lord from heaven, who has come in, because the first man was turned out.<a name=207:5></a> In blessed grace He comes down.<a name=207:6></a> And we have seen it, he says, and heard it -- the Word of life -- that is, in Christ.<a name=207:7></a> He was walking about this world, another kind of life altogether.<a name=207:8></a> That is what he calls "from the beginning.<a name=207:9></a>" It was an entirely new thing manifested here below.<a name=207:10></a> Wherever there is the fulness of grace brought in, that is, our privileges and relationships, we get the Father and the Son.<a name=207:11></a> Of course it is God, but God brought out in these relationships; verses 1-4.<a name=207:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thing we have here, in virtue of the life God has given to us, is the fulness of the privileges of the saints in Christ.<a name=207:13></a> They have fellowship with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.<a name=207:14></a> But in the next place he brings a second point out, and it is this: If you say you have that kind of fellowship, and walk in darkness, it is all false, because darkness cannot have fellowship with light.<a name=207:15></a> If you have perfect grace bringing in divine life -- the life that was manifested in the Person of Christ, and then communicated to us, he next says, It is light.<a name=207:16></a> God does not change the holiness of His nature; and therefore the pretence to have fellowship with it, if we are walking in darkness, is all false.<a name=207:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Connected with this he presents the remedy as regards our state; that is, that Christ cleanses us and makes us fit for the light.<a name=207:18></a> And the second thing which comes out in the next chapter is, that when, in our weakness, we have fallen into sin, "we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.<a name=207:19></a>" Grace has provided for the evil, though there can be no communion with God in it.<a name=207:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, we have the fulness of the blessing, eternal life in Christ; next its nature and character -- God's light and purity; and then the means by which it is possible that such sinners as we can have all this blessing -- first, by the cleansing, and then by the advocacy of Christ.<a name=207:21></a>

		Then he enters a little more into the practical condition of our own conscience.<a name=210:1></a> "If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.<a name=210:2></a>" That is where truth in the inward part comes out.<a name=210:3></a> The new nature in us judges all the sin that is in us.<a name=210:4></a> He does not deny that we have learnt the truth; but if Christ is the truth in me, it must judge all that is of the old man as sin.<a name=210:5></a> If a person has only learnt the truth outwardly, he may gloss over all the rest.<a name=210:6></a> But if the truth is in us, everything comes out.<a name=210:7></a> If I say, I have no sin, looked at as in the flesh, I deceive myself, and the truth is not in me.<a name=210:8></a> Yet it is not merely saying that there is sin in me that is the thing.<a name=210:9></a> It is when really the heart and conscience are touched, so that I own I personally followed the flesh.<a name=210:10></a> It is not a doctrine then.<a name=210:11></a> "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.<a name=210:12></a>" His bearing towards us is gracious and forgiving, and He cleanses us completely.<a name=210:13></a>

		But these are the two things that are called for; first, to know that the truth is in us; and then to confess our sins.<a name=210:18></a> A man may be dreadfully proud, and not like to confess it; but when a person has, through divine grace, got the upper hand, he hates himself instead of excusing his sin, he confesses it, he has got right with God, and God says, I will forgive you; it is all done with.<a name=210:19></a> We stand before God in the sense of His favour.<a name=210:20></a> But, besides that, we stand before God with the consciousness of being perfectly clear in His sight.<a name=210:21></a> If I get into the light, with any dirt upon me, I see it there; if I am in the dark, I see no difference.<a name=210:22></a> If we are in the light before God, all is seen.<a name=210:23></a> But if I am cleansed and in the light; I only see the more that there is not a spot in me.<a name=210:24></a> The two opening verses of chapter 2 are the means of maintaining us in the light.<a name=210:25></a>

		Chapter 1 takes up these two things: first, the fulness of the blessing in fellowship with the Father and Son; and, secondly, the nature of the fellowship, and then how a sinner can have it -- the individual state of soul as judging and confessing sins, and truth in the inward parts.<a name=211:1></a> I cannot say I have no sin and yet I say I am clean before God.<a name=211:2></a> There is where people mistake.<a name=211:3></a> They want a divine nature, which, instead of pretending to works, judges every thing according to the light.<a name=211:4></a> Wherever there is sin on the conscience there cannot be communion, though there is a blessed means of grace that does cleanse.<a name=211:5></a> "The blood of Jesus Christ, his Son, cleanseth us from all sin.<a name=211:6></a>" In chapter 2: 1, 2, we have the remedy for daily defilement.<a name=211:7></a> There it is Christ, not to maintain righteousness, but to restore communion.<a name=211:8></a>

		CHAPTER 2
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The two first verses connect themselves as a kind of supplement to the preceding chapter.<a name=211:9></a> He had put before them this privilege of fellowship with the Father and the Son, which must be in the light; and there was this perfect remedy, the blood of Christ, which presents us clean in the light.<a name=211:10></a> Now he says, "These things write I unto you, that ye sin not.<a name=211:11></a>" The object of all this was that they should not sin.<a name=211:12></a> "And if any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.<a name=211:13></a>" It is not exactly the same thing as in Hebrews, where we find a priest with God, because there the question is of the possibility of our coming to God.<a name=211:14></a> There it is making good the truth that we can go to God, and it has that character throughout.<a name=211:15></a> But all through the Gospel and Epistle of John he speaks of more than merely going to God as a public worshipper.<a name=211:16></a> Here we are much more intimate with Him.<a name=211:17></a> It is a different thing that I can go and worship before God and approach Him, or that I am in intimate fellowship with Him.<a name=211:18></a> We get into relationship with Him.<a name=211:19></a> Whenever he speaks of grace, he speaks of the Father and Son, and when of light he speaks of God.<a name=211:20></a> In John 8, where they are all convicted of sin, it is God.<a name=211:21></a> "Before Abraham was, I am.<a name=211:22></a>" When he gets to grace, He speaks of being a good Shepherd, who gives His life for the sheep, and whose voice the sheep know.<a name=211:23></a> He says there is as much intimacy between you and Me as between Me and My Father.<a name=211:24></a> There is the perfect revelation of love in an intimate relationship like that.<a name=211:25></a>
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Advocacy here is connected with the Father.<a name=212:1></a> Where communion is interrupted, it is restored: we do not cease to be sons and to be accepted.<a name=212:2></a> It is not a question here of whether as a sinner I can come to God or not, but of the loss of this intimacy which the least idle word destroys.<a name=212:3></a> And this makes it still further plain that accepted persons are spoken of here.<a name=212:4></a> It is not a question now of God's accepting.<a name=212:5></a> Not even priesthood has to do with that, still less advocacy with the Father.<a name=212:6></a> It supposes that we are naughty children, and that the freedom of this intimacy is destroyed, and Christ takes the place of Advocate to restore it.<a name=212:7></a> Grace works, but there is never any mitigation of sin in itself; it is no allowance of evil.<a name=212:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The ground is thus laid in this remarkable manner.<a name=212:9></a> There are two things to consider; our standing in the presence of God, and, on the other hand, the evil which is inconsistent with it.<a name=212:10></a> Christ has met both.<a name=212:11></a> "We have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.<a name=212:12></a>" This never changes.<a name=212:13></a> The place which we have with God abides there, because Christ, the righteous One, is there.<a name=212:14></a> The perfectly accepted Person is in the presence of God, and God is honoured about the failure.<a name=212:15></a> "And he is the propitiation for our sins.<a name=212:16></a>" So that the advocacy of Christ with the Father is founded upon this acceptance, first of His Person, and then of His work for us.<a name=212:17></a> We are accepted in the Beloved, and this never changes, because the righteous One always appears in the presence of God for us.<a name=212:18></a> And yet the Lord does not allow anything contrary to Himself.<a name=212:19></a> Sin is not passed over.<a name=212:20></a> "We have an advocate.<a name=212:21></a>" And yet if He is the Advocate for these persons who have failed, it is because He is the propitiation for their sins.<a name=212:22></a> There is perfect acceptance.<a name=212:23></a> Having met all requirements about sin on the cross, we are put in the presence of God in the acceptance of Christ Himself.<a name=212:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the whole world.<a name=213:1></a>" This blood-shedding is put upon the mercy-seat, in virtue of which we can go and preach the gospel to every creature.<a name=213:2></a> It does not mean that all are reconciled, but that the testimony of God's mercy went out not to Jews only, but to every creature in the world.<a name=213:3></a> Through this blood we can stand in His presence; but there failure comes to be the question for the conscience of the saint, and then the advocacy of Christ applies.<a name=213:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But now he takes up another subject -- the practical tests before men that we have got this life.<a name=213:5></a> In the main we may say that love to the brethren, and righteousness or obedience, are the grand tests.<a name=213:6></a> This eternal life we have seen in contrast with sin, sustained by the grace of Christ.<a name=213:7></a> Now we come to the same life shewn in its fruits down here; and they were calling in question whether they had this life or not.<a name=213:8></a> Therefore he gives, in order to keep them in the consciousness and certainty that they had that life, these traits of it, which some of those of high profession had not.<a name=213:9></a> "And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.<a name=213:10></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would just observe here that throughout this Epistle you will find God and Christ so entirely united in the thought of the apostle, that he speaks of one and then of the other in relation to the same thing Look at the last chapter: "And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ.<a name=213:11></a> This is the true God and eternal life.<a name=213:12></a>" God is revealed to us in Christ.<a name=213:13></a> It may seem confusion, but it brings out the glory of the Person of Christ.<a name=213:14></a> So here (verse 28), "And now, little children, abide in him; that when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.<a name=213:15></a> If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him.<a name=213:16></a>" He begins with Christ's appearing, and the same sentence ends with God Himself.<a name=213:17></a> So here, with regard to God's commandments.<a name=213:18></a> "Hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.<a name=213:19></a>" They are Christ's commandments, and yet they are God's too.<a name=213:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next, we are told that "He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.<a name=213:21></a>" A man says he knows God and does not keep His commandments -- the truth is not in him, because this life is an obedient life, and if Christ is our life, the principles of Christ's life are the same in us.<a name=213:22></a> If the principle of obedience is not there, life is not there.<a name=213:23></a> But this is not all.<a name=213:24></a> "Whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected; hereby know we that we are in him.<a name=213:25></a>" This gives a great deal more than the mere fact that he is a liar, if he says he knows God and does not keep His commandments.<a name=213:26></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thing to be remarked is this, that all John's statements are absolute.<a name=214:1></a> He never modifies them by bringing in the difficulties or hindrances that we may have in the body.<a name=214:2></a> "He that is born of God," he says in chapter 3, "does not commit sin.<a name=214:3></a>" He is speaking there according to the very essence of the nature.<a name=214:4></a> The divine nature cannot sin.<a name=214:5></a> It is not a question of progress or degree, but "he cannot sin because he is born of God.<a name=214:6></a>" "He that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not," chapter 5.<a name=214:7></a> The wicked one touches the Christian often; but he never can touch the divine life: and John always states it in its own proper absoluteness, according to the truth itself.<a name=214:8></a> There are plenty of other scriptures that shew our inconsistency.<a name=214:9></a> But if the flesh acts, it is not this new life, but you get the measure of it in itself.<a name=214:10></a> "Whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected," etc.<a name=214:11></a> That is absolute.<a name=214:12></a> If I am only saying an idle word, it is not keeping His word.<a name=214:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is an immensely blessed truth.<a name=214:14></a> Because if I was under law and took His word in that way, I should have nothing to do with life.<a name=214:15></a> It tells me to love God, and in that I fail.<a name=214:16></a> But here the revelation I have of God in Christ is perfect love.<a name=214:17></a> The love of God is manifested, and if His word dwells in our hearts, His word is love and His love is perfected in us.<a name=214:18></a> "If a man keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected.<a name=214:19></a>" In him -- not only towards him.<a name=214:20></a> If the word is kept, that word is the power of Christ in us, and that is the perfect love of God enjoyed in the heart.<a name=214:21></a> We may fail in keeping it, but the Apostle does not give these kinds of modifications, but the truth in itself; and it is thoroughly true, and experienced in the measure that the word of God is kept in the heart.<a name=214:22></a> The Holy Ghost is the power, but we cannot separate this from the word.<a name=214:23></a> He is in us, and we have got that love in our souls -- God's love as manifested in Christ.<a name=214:24></a> Supposing I am disobedient, I get sin in my heart instead of Christ.<a name=214:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected; hereby know we that we are in him.<a name=214:26></a>" Now he says we are in Him.<a name=214:27></a> We dwell in God.<a name=214:28></a> If I say I am in Him, I have got this strength and shelter in Him.<a name=214:29></a> Now you must walk as He walked.<a name=214:30></a> Christ is my life.<a name=214:31></a> Then I must walk like Christ.<a name=214:32></a> It is not be as He was; but we are not to walk according to the flesh.<a name=214:33></a> Therefore he does not say, You ought to be what Christ was; but "He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk even as he walked.<a name=214:34></a>" If you say you abide in Him, you are there always: you should always walk as He walked.<a name=214:35></a> There is never any reason for walking after the flesh.<a name=214:36></a> The flesh is in us, but that is no reason why we should walk after it.<a name=214:37></a> I am always at liberty to walk spiritually.<a name=214:38></a> There is liberty before God as to the walk.<a name=214:39></a> If I have got a fleshly nature, a commandment comes contrary to the will of that nature.<a name=214:40></a> I want to go into town, and I am ordered off into the country.<a name=214:41></a> I do not like it.<a name=214:42></a> But supposing I was longing to go into town, and my father says, You must go into town; why then to do the commandment is liberty.<a name=214:43></a> So now all the commandments of Christ are according to the nature that I have got already.<a name=214:44></a> Christ is my life, and all Christ's words are the expression of that life.<a name=214:45></a> And therefore when Christ's words are given to me, they only give me the authority to do what my nature likes to do.<a name=214:46></a> All the words of Christ are the expression of what He was.<a name=214:47></a> They told out His nature and life and being; and, when we have that nature, they guide and direct us.<a name=214:48></a> Therefore it is real and holy liberty.<a name=214:49></a> We ought to walk even as He walked.<a name=214:50></a>

		This comes in now as breaking in upon the general course of the Epistle, and giving an account of why he wrote, and what he felt in writing.<a name=216:22></a> And first we find him speaking to all Christians, whom he calls "My children," and then addressing different classes of Christians, and telling why he wrote to them.<a name=216:23></a> It is his heart opening itself out to those to whom he was writing: and then we get some important practical truths.<a name=216:24></a>

		In verse 12 the word "children" is the same as in verses 1, 28, but different from the "little children" in verses 13, 18.<a name=217:1></a> In the former he is speaking of all Christians, and calls them his "children"; whereas, in the other verses, he distinguishes between the young men, fathers, and the little children [babes] <i>(paidia)</i> or the youngest Christians.<a name=217:2></a> But in verses 1, 12, 28, the word <i>teknia</i> includes all saints.<a name=217:3></a>

		"I write unto you, children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake, verse 12.<a name=217:4></a>" That is true of all Christians.<a name=217:5></a> It is their universal condition.<a name=217:6></a> He had said before, "Hereby we know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.<a name=217:7></a>" This was not to throw any doubt upon Christians being forgiven, but to stablish them in the truth, inasmuch as he says, "I write unto you children, because your sins are forgiven for his name's sake.<a name=217:8></a>" This was a settled thing; they were all forgiven, and he wrote unto them because they were forgiven.<a name=217:9></a> A person that is not forgiven, the Epistle does not apply to.<a name=217:10></a> He takes that ground in writing to them.<a name=217:11></a> He says, "I write unto you, children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.<a name=217:12></a>" Such was the common condition of all Christians.<a name=217:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But now, when he comes to the different classes of Christians, there is a different character and position given to each of them.<a name=217:14></a> "I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning.<a name=217:15></a>" Amongst the children of verse 12 there may be old Christians and babes.<a name=217:16></a> The fathers had known "him that is from the beginning.<a name=217:17></a>" We have seen before, this means Christ in the world, His Person manifested in flesh.<a name=217:18></a> "Ye have known him that is from the beginning.<a name=217:19></a>" That is where all experience ends; not in a knowledge of self merely as being occupied with it, but in such a knowledge as empties us of self, and gives us Christ.<a name=217:20></a> When a person is a young Christian, he is occupied with his feelings; it is all fresh and new to him, and it is right enough.<a name=217:21></a> He feels such wonderful joy in being forgiven.<a name=217:22></a> But, as you grow up, you get more and more emptied of self and occupied with Christ.<a name=217:23></a> Christ is this, and Christ that.<a name=217:24></a> In verse 14 he only repeats the same thing when writing to the fathers.<a name=217:25></a> He has a great deal to add when he writes to the young men, but to the fathers, it is still, "Ye have known him that is from the beginning.<a name=217:26></a>" We learn our own foolishness and weakness, and so are cast upon Christ, and learn more of the depths of His grace, the perfectness of His Person.<a name=217:27></a> All right experience ends in forgetting self and thinking of Christ.<a name=217:28></a>

		Next, he comes to the young men: "I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one.<a name=218:1></a>" Having Christ with them, they have got strength in conflict and in service -- they have overcome Satan.<a name=218:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then he says, "I write.<a name=218:3></a> unto you babes, because ye have known the Father.<a name=218:4></a>" Here again, we get another remarkable fact as to what he thought about Christians.<a name=218:5></a> That is, the babes in Christ -- they that were but little children -- had the Spirit of adoption.<a name=218:6></a> He has no idea of the weakest Christian not knowing that he was a child of God.<a name=218:7></a> To know Christ well, in the riches and excellence of His Person, is to be a father in Christ.<a name=218:8></a> But the youngest Christian knows that he is a child, and that the Father is his Father.<a name=218:9></a> It is like all Christians being forgiven -- it is his place as a Christian.<a name=218:10></a> "We have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but we have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba Father.<a name=218:11></a>" It is not that you will not find persons doubting.<a name=218:12></a> You will find many a person who, if you ask him whether he is a child of God or not, will think it very humble to doubt about it, but who, in his prayers, cries, "Abba Father," with all his heart.<a name=218:13></a> It is between him and God.<a name=218:14></a> Repeating it over again, he has nothing to add to what he has said to the fathers, because all ends in Christ.<a name=218:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With the young men he goes more into detail because of the difficulties of the way, and he brings out the secret of strength for them -- the word of God, in the midst of this world, where nothing is owned of God -- God's mind comes into this world, and that is what we want.<a name=218:16></a> There is no way in the desert, as it is said in the Old Testament.<a name=218:17></a> The word of God shows God's way in the midst of a world where there is none.<a name=218:18></a> Therefore, when they are in the conflict, he says, "I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.<a name=218:19></a>" That is the word by which Christ Himself overcame when the wicked one came and offered Him all the kingdoms of the world, He answered by the word -- He overcame the wicked one.<a name=218:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then he warns them: "Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world.<a name=218:21></a> If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.<a name=218:22></a> For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.<a name=218:23></a>" These things belong to it.<a name=218:24></a> All the glory of this world is not of the Father at all.<a name=218:25></a> And the more we look into John, and indeed all through the New Testament scripture, we may see these two great systems brought out plainly.<a name=218:26></a> He does not say you do not love Christ.<a name=218:27></a> But there is one great system that belongs to the Father, and another that belongs to the world.<a name=218:28></a> Every thing belongs to God as a Creator; but morally all is departed from Him.<a name=218:29></a> It was the devil that made this world, looked at as a moral world.<a name=218:30></a> God made paradise; and man sinned and got out of it, and then made up this world.<a name=218:31></a> Cain went out from the presence of the Lord and builded a city, and called it after the name of his son.<a name=218:32></a> Then God sent His Son, and they would not have Him, and thus it was a judged world.<a name=218:33></a> God has put it fully to the test -- without law, under law, and then by His Son; and then He says, It is all judged.<a name=218:34></a> But then He has a way of His own, the Father has, and you cannot have both.<a name=218:35></a> If you love the world, the love of the Father is not in you.<a name=218:36></a> You may be tempted by it, and have to overcome it; but if you love it, the love of the Father is not in you; because He has got a system of His own, and you are going to the other system.<a name=218:37></a> It is so all through.<a name=218:38></a> In the Gospel we get divine life in the Person of Christ, and in the Epistle this divine life in the persons of Christians.<a name=218:39></a> In John 8 you will see the same truth.<a name=218:40></a> "Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.<a name=218:41></a>" There is no middle path with God.<a name=218:42></a> If they are of this world, they are from beneath; and if they are not of this world, they are from above.<a name=218:43></a> He says, I am not of this world; I am from above: because He came from the Father.<a name=218:44></a> You are of the world, and therefore from beneath, because it is Satan's world.<a name=218:45></a> So here -- if the love of the world is in you, the love of the Father cannot be.<a name=218:46></a> There is another divine system, where the love of the Father is displayed, and if you belong to that, you have to overcome the world.<a name=218:47></a> It is not of the Father; it does not belong to that system.<a name=218:48></a>

		Then he adds this: "The world passeth away, and the lust thereof; but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.<a name=219:1></a>" Satan's works cannot last.<a name=219:2></a> They are seductive while they are there, but they cannot last: "but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.<a name=219:3></a>" We have the same thing in Peter's Epistle, "All flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass.<a name=219:4></a> The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away, but the word of the Lord endureth for ever.<a name=219:5></a>" So here.<a name=219:6></a> "He that doeth the will of God abideth for ever" -- he that follows that word.<a name=219:7></a> The word of God brings all this into us, and that is what we have to follow.<a name=219:8></a>

		Now he turns to the third class, having given this warning to the young men.<a name=220:1></a> For when a Christian is first converted, he would not thank you for the world.<a name=220:2></a> But when he has got on a little, the freshness fades; the world gradually eats out his freshness.<a name=220:3></a> If he is not careful, if his soul is not full of the things that are not seen, he gradually slips into the world.<a name=220:4></a> If he is full of Christ, he does not even see the things around.<a name=220:5></a> In chapter 5 John speaks of overcoming the world.<a name=220:6></a> There is the loss of all power and spiritual enjoyment, if the spirit of the world comes in: you cannot think of the things which the world suggests and the things of the Father at the same time.<a name=220:7></a> If the Holy Ghost is suggesting divine things to me, I have the present consciousness of belonging to all these things.<a name=220:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He turns, in verse 18, to the little children, and he tells them, "It is the last time.<a name=220:9></a>" That is a remarkable expression, because eighteen hundred years have gone on since then, and it remains equally true that it is the last time; only the Lord, in His patience, is waiting, and not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.<a name=220:10></a> But it is the last time, because the power of evil has come in.<a name=220:11></a> When Christ was here, and was rejected, the power of evil was in the world.<a name=220:12></a> Then, when God raised up the church by the presence of the Holy Ghost, while Christ was on high, so that a man was in heaven, and the Holy Ghost in the world; there came power of redemption into the middle of Satan's world.<a name=220:13></a> That was not the last time.<a name=220:14></a> But now antichrists had come in, and he says, "this is the last time," because even this had failed, and nothing will come after this but judgment.<a name=220:15></a> "Little children, it is the last time; and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists, whereby we know that it is the last time.<a name=220:16></a> They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would not doubt have continued with us; but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.<a name=220:17></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		These babes in Christ had broken with the world; they had done with its course.<a name=220:18></a> But here was a new kind of evil in the very place of divine power; persons setting up themselves, and abandoning Christ, and this was more dangerous.<a name=220:19></a> They had broken with the world, and knew what it was.<a name=220:20></a> But here comes in spiritual wickedness in heavenly places.<a name=220:21></a> He warns the babes against these enemies of the last times.<a name=220:22></a> Thank God, we have the warnings now.<a name=220:23></a> The apostle Paul even says, these are the last days, which is stronger still.<a name=220:24></a> But there is entire security where Christ is looked to.<a name=220:25></a> It is remarkable how he looks at the presence of the Spirit of God in the saints.<a name=220:26></a> He may be a babe; but God will not suffer him to be tempted above that he is able to bear.<a name=220:27></a> There may be the young men, but God gives them discernment; they know not the voice of strangers.<a name=220:28></a> These people may come to them with ever so much pretension, but it is not a voice they know.<a name=220:29></a> They know the voice of Christ, and they follow Him.<a name=220:30></a>

		We saw that the babes in Christ knew the Father, and now we find further that these very babes have the divine unction, so that they will be able to judge through divine knowledge.<a name=221:1></a> He is pressing upon them their own competence, not as others, in themselves, but as taught of God, to avoid all snares.<a name=221:2></a> It is the subtlety of Satan, and therefore he warns the little ones more against it.<a name=221:3></a> "But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things.<a name=221:4></a> I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.<a name=221:5></a> Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ?<a name=221:6></a> He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.<a name=221:7></a>" Here he gives us the full character of the antichrist.<a name=221:8></a> There were many antichrists, because the spirit of it had come in.<a name=221:9></a> Here it is the full character of it.<a name=221:10></a> It takes a certain Jewish character, denying Jesus to be the Christ; and it is opposed to Christianity, denying the Father and the Son.<a name=221:11></a>

		"Let that, therefore," the apostle says, "abide in you which ye have heard from the beginning.<a name=221:13></a> If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son and in the Father.<a name=221:14></a>" It is the Person of Christ.<a name=221:15></a> Instead of talking about the church as a body that teaches, I say it is taught.<a name=221:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The thing that is revealed is the Person of the Lord Jesus Christ, that which was from the beginning.<a name=221:17></a> But if my soul is resting upon that, the truth about Christ as taught by the Holy Ghost, I am taught of the Father.<a name=221:18></a> "That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes .<a name=221:19></a>.<a name=221:20></a>.<a name=221:21></a> of the word of life.<a name=221:22></a>" And now he says, "Let that therefore abide in you which ye have heard from the beginning.<a name=221:23></a>" It is the Person of Christ that is the great thing, and it was by the revelation of Him that the church itself was formed.<a name=221:24></a> It exists in virtue of being taught of God.<a name=221:25></a>

		The church does not teach -- had nothing to do with teaching at all.<a name=222:1></a> God may raise up individuals in the church to teach, but the thing pressed upon us is that which we have heard from the beginning.<a name=222:2></a> It is a test of divine truth that we hold fast the starting-point -- Jesus Christ.<a name=222:3></a> This is what tests everything.<a name=222:4></a> Where people insist upon the authority of the church, they never have the certainty of being children.<a name=222:5></a> If I am taught of God, I shall know what I have got for certain.<a name=222:6></a> Faith is always absolutely certain.<a name=222:7></a> If I have got the Father, I know that I am a child.<a name=222:8></a> I may be a naughty child, but still I am a child.<a name=222:9></a> "If that which ye have heard from the beginning remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son and in the Father.<a name=222:10></a> And this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life.<a name=222:11></a>" He has promised me eternal life, and I shall have it; it is a perfectly settled thing.<a name=222:12></a>

		A babe in Christ being most in danger, he enters into these kinds of warnings; but a person grown up into Christ knew very well where these things came from.<a name=222:19></a> What we now might think would be very learned things in Christianity, he says to the babes; but the great thing that marks those that are the most advanced -- the fathers -- is their knowledge of Christ.<a name=222:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle takes up again in verse 28 all Christians in general, with an exhortation to abide in Him.<a name=222:21></a> You have here God in Christ so before the apostle's mind, that he says "Him," without saying who He is.<a name=222:22></a> He had been talking about the anointing -- "even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.<a name=222:23></a>" Previously, it was rather God as such spoken of; but "when he shall appear," we know Christ is meant thereby.<a name=222:24></a>

		"And now, little children, abide in him; that when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.<a name=223:1></a>" If they did not abide in Him, the apostle had lost all his work.<a name=223:2></a> It would have been so far to his shame.<a name=223:3></a> You get the same thing in the second epistle (verse 8), "Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.<a name=223:4></a>" It is just what the apostle says to the Corinthians; 1 Corinthians 3: 12, etc.<a name=223:5></a>) If we build upon the foundation, wood, hay, and stubble, the work will be burnt; there will be loss: he is proved to be a bad workman.<a name=223:6></a> The apostle here is pressing upon them to abide in Christ, that he may not be ashamed of his work.<a name=223:7></a> It is "that we may have confidence and not be ashamed," etc.<a name=223:8></a> -- not that you may have confidence, etc.<a name=223:9></a> It is just what you see in the second epistle.<a name=223:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then he takes up the second great object of the epistle -- that communication of the divine nature of Christ, as our life, which gives us the same traits and characters that there are in God Himself -- "which thing is true in him and in you.<a name=223:11></a>" God is love, and the Christian loves.<a name=223:12></a> God is holy, and the Christian is so too.<a name=223:13></a> In His almighty power God, of course, is alone.<a name=223:14></a> But in what may be called the character of God, inasmuch as we are born of Him, we are like Him.<a name=223:15></a> And this divine nature enables us to enjoy God, as well as to be like Him.<a name=223:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, again, we see that God and Christ are so absolutely one, that the apostle says, "that we may not be ashamed before him at his coming"; but immediately he adds, "If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that everyone that doeth righteousness is born of him.<a name=223:17></a>" We are born of God; yet he would appear to be speaking of the same one that should come -- which is Christ.<a name=223:18></a> We find the same truth in Daniel 7.<a name=223:19></a> The Ancient of days described there is in Revelation 1 the Son of man.<a name=223:20></a> We get in Christ what the character and nature of God is in a man as living in this world; and then he shews that it is true of us too, as having the same life.<a name=223:21></a> He is righteous; and if a man doeth righteousness, he is born of Him.<a name=223:22></a> He has this nature.<a name=223:23></a>

		It is not merely a nature that is given to us, but as creatures we must have an object for this nature and this is the Lord.<a name=241:1></a> I must have the true object, and therefore, "Who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?<a name=241:2></a>" He is occupied with something.<a name=241:3></a> When I find that the One whom the world has spit upon and crucified is the Son of God, I say such is what the world is.<a name=241:4></a> And therefore when my faith really rests upon Jesus as this despised One, the Son of God, I have done with the world; I overcome it as an enemy.<a name=241:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There we have the short account of these saints.<a name=241:6></a> They are born of God: they are a set of people that belong to Him as those that are alive; they live in another world that belongs to the Father.<a name=241:7></a> He then speaks of the spirit and power in which Christ came, that by which we are connected with this scene of blessedness that belongs to the Father.<a name=241:8></a> "This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood.<a name=241:9></a>" This goes back to a most vital principle that we have had all through the Epistle.<a name=241:10></a> If it had been by water only, John the Baptist came by water.<a name=241:11></a> The word of God, if only applied to man as a child of Adam, could not purify him.<a name=241:12></a> Christ coming into the world by that put man to the test; and man was God's enemy, and, therefore, there was no mending him at all.<a name=241:13></a> It then became a question of redemption, of blood, as well as water, and that life was in the Son; not in the first Adam, but in the Second.<a name=241:14></a> "This is he that came by water and blood.<a name=241:15></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a cleansing, as we know; but this is the effect of redemption on the new life.<a name=241:16></a> It was out of a dead Christ that the cleansing came.<a name=241:17></a> A living Christ coming into the world presents Himself to man to see whether any link could be formed between God and man.<a name=241:18></a> But then was man finally condemned, and death comes in.<a name=241:19></a> It was always so.<a name=241:20></a> There is no life in us.<a name=241:21></a> "If ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.<a name=241:22></a>" And that is the reason why He says you must eat the flesh and drink the blood.<a name=241:23></a> If you do not take Him as a dead Christ, you have nothing, for that cleansing came out of a dead Christ.<a name=241:24></a> It is death to the old thing, and a new life entirely is brought in.<a name=241:25></a>
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there comes another blessed truth.<a name=242:1></a> We have a dead Christ, now alive for evermore; and next we have the Holy Ghost dwelling in us.<a name=242:2></a> But this is all as belonging to a new world.<a name=242:3></a> "There are three that bear witness -- the Spirit, the water, and the blood.<a name=242:4></a>" We have three witnesses, the Spirit bearing testimony; the water, the cleansing power; and the blood, the expiatory power; and these all agree in one.<a name=242:5></a> There is no cleansing of the old nature, but there is a new nature given.<a name=242:6></a> "God hath given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.<a name=242:7></a>" It is not by mending the old Adam, but it is life in the Son.<a name=242:8></a> "He that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.<a name=242:9></a>" There is no life belonging to the old man, it is a rejected thing, and there will not be two Adams in heaven.<a name=242:10></a> Here is the Son, and those that have life in the Son.<a name=242:11></a> God began working out this since the fall, but the full truth of it was brought out when Christ was risen.<a name=242:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there is another point in connection with the truth, and that is, the knowledge of it.<a name=242:13></a> "He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself," because we have got Christ, through the Spirit of Christ in us.<a name=242:14></a> Therefore I know that I have eternal life -- that I am a child of God.<a name=242:15></a> We have got this blessed consciousness and comfort.<a name=242:16></a> The work has been wrought, the blood is shed, and, besides that, I cry, Abba, Father, through the Spirit that dwells in me.<a name=242:17></a> That is, "He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself.<a name=242:18></a>" He has got the thing; in a word, he has Christ.<a name=242:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The fault of the unbeliever is not that he has not the blessing, but that he makes God a liar.<a name=242:20></a> God has given an adequate witness about His Son; and "he that believeth not God hath made him a liar.<a name=242:21></a>" And therefore a person rejecting the gospel is rejecting God's testimony about His Son.<a name=242:22></a> The witness was sufficient.<a name=242:23></a> We read of many who believed on His name.<a name=242:24></a> But they did not overcome the world, because there was no real faith.<a name=242:25></a> Jesus did not commit Himself to them.<a name=242:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.<a name=242:27></a>" It is of all importance to see that it is not a mending of the nature that we have already, but the giving to us one that we had not before, in receiving Christ as our life.<a name=242:28></a> And all the rest is accomplished.<a name=242:29></a> The Spirit is the Holy Ghost present in the world.<a name=242:30></a> The water came out of Christ's side as well as the blood.<a name=242:31></a> Water cleanses what already exists.<a name=242:32></a> The water is the washing by the word -- but not without the power of the Holy Ghost.<a name=242:33></a> It is the application of the word by the Holy Ghost.<a name=242:34></a> But besides that, the water gives the idea of the washing by the word; and therefore he says we are born of water and the Spirit.<a name=242:35></a>

		One thing remains -- the present confidence that we have with God.<a name=243:1></a> "These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God, that ye may know that ye have eternal life, ye that believe on the name of the Son of God.<a name=243:2></a>" And then there comes every-day confidence.<a name=243:3></a> "And this is the confidence that we have in him, that if we ask anything according to his will, he heareth us.<a name=243:4></a>" We are really reconciled to God.<a name=243:5></a> It is not an uncertain condition with God, but we are at home with Him.<a name=243:6></a> We have confidence in Him.<a name=243:7></a> It is not merely the fact that we have been saved, but we have present confidence.<a name=243:8></a> "And if we know that he heareth us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.<a name=243:9></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is another privilege we have -- that of intercession for others.<a name=243:10></a> And now, too, we get just a hint at the dealings of God in the way of government with a man that.<a name=243:11></a> is saved.<a name=243:12></a> "If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death.<a name=243:13></a> There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it.<a name=243:14></a> All unrighteousness is sin; and there is a sin not unto death.<a name=243:15></a>" In the case of Ananias and Sapphira, there was a sin unto death.<a name=243:16></a> There is a constant dealing of God in government with His children, when if the sin be not of that character as unto death (it may go on to it), it is a question of discipline.<a name=243:17></a> There is many a sickness that is a discipline of God in some shape or another -- positive discipline, which, if the heart were bowed to God about it, would be for good.<a name=243:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chastenings are not always for actual faults.<a name=243:19></a> In Job it is said (chapter 33: 18, 19), "He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.<a name=243:20></a> He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain"; and that we find from verse 17 is for the purpose of hiding pride from man.<a name=243:21></a> Then in chapter 36 the chastening is for positive faults (verse 9).<a name=243:22></a> "Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.<a name=243:23></a> He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.<a name=243:24></a>" There was a positive discipline of God.<a name=243:25></a> It is not merely here that there is this discipline, and that if there is a "messenger with him, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness, that there he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down into the pit," etc.<a name=243:26></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But now, as a Christian, you are competent yourself to be a messenger.<a name=244:1></a> The Christian having the title of intercession, and walking with God, he has this access to God to be heard in whatever he asks.<a name=244:2></a> When then you see a brother sin, and come under the discipline of God you go and be to him this messenger, one among a thousand.<a name=244:3></a> It is a matter of discipline and chastening for sin: and if this intercession be used, he will be restored.<a name=244:4></a> It supposes a person walking with God to be able to be this interpreter.<a name=244:5></a>

		"And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness.<a name=244:12></a>" He sums up all in these two verses.<a name=244:13></a> "The whole world lieth in wickedness," and "we are of God.<a name=244:14></a>" We blink at things that are so plain sometimes, in order to save a little bit of the world.<a name=244:15></a> But "we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding that we may know him that is true: and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ.<a name=244:16></a>" God being revealed in Christ, and we being in Christ, we have got our place in a scene outside the world altogether.<a name=244:17></a>

		NOTES ON THE SECOND EPISTLE OF JOHN
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What specially characterises the Epistle is the connection of the truth with the manifestation of love.<a name=245:1></a> Both the second and third Epistles are occupied with the receiving of these who are going about preaching.<a name=245:2></a> The third Epistle commends those who went forth for Christ's sake, to the love of the faithful, who in receiving such, became fellow-helpers to the truth.<a name=245:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here John warns this lady against receiving certain persons that did not bring the truth.<a name=245:4></a> He had pressed extremely the walking in love in the first Epistle.<a name=245:5></a> And so here too he says, "I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.<a name=245:6></a>" Then he takes these two guards of true charity: one is the truth and the other is obedience -- just what Christ was when He was in the world.<a name=245:7></a> He was love come into the world, the witness and testimony of love, and He was the truth, and He was the obedient man.<a name=245:8></a> His love to His Father was shewn in His obeying Him in all things.<a name=245:9></a> He was the truth in shewing out everything just as it was.<a name=245:10></a> Besides, He came down to do the will of Him who sent Him.<a name=245:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		John takes up these three great principles here.<a name=245:12></a> Love -- divine charity -- is insisted on, but it is always the truth, because it is Christ; and if it is not in the truth, it is denying Christ: it is saying there can be love in nature.<a name=245:13></a> The third thing is this obedience to the commandments of Christ.<a name=245:14></a> Such is the business of a Christian obeying Christ, with truth in the heart, and love as the spring of all.<a name=245:15></a> And that is just Christ.<a name=245:16></a> You cannot separate them.<a name=245:17></a> The flesh may put on the appearance of a thing; it may put on a great show of love; but it is not truth and obedience, it is not Christ.<a name=245:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here it is a question of conscience with anyone.<a name=245:19></a> It is not an ecclesiastical question, but of a woman if so called on.<a name=245:20></a> It is a matter of personal conscience with every saint, the question of the individual receiving Christ in His members and of refusing whatsoever denies Christ.<a name=245:21></a> And this is the means of judging of it: "For the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever.<a name=245:22></a>" The apostle loved the lady and her children, but it was for the truth's sake.<a name=245:23></a> Where there was not that, there could be no divine love.<a name=245:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=246>[Page 246]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the next verse, again, we have "from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.<a name=246:1></a>" "I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.<a name=246:2></a>" Now he brings in the obedience: it is a commandment from the Father.<a name=246:3></a> He will have the Son honoured, even as Himself.<a name=246:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"And now I beseech you, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.<a name=246:5></a> And this is love, that we walk after his commandments.<a name=246:6></a>" Just as Christ walked after the commandments of God because He loved Him.<a name=246:7></a> As He said (John 14: 31), "That the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do.<a name=246:8></a>" So it is with those that follow Him.<a name=246:9></a> "This is the commandment, that, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.<a name=246:10></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then he adds, "Many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh.<a name=246:11></a> This is a deceiver and an antichrist.<a name=246:12></a>" If this divine love came down in a man, what was it to deny that?<a name=246:13></a> Christ came as a man.<a name=246:14></a> It could not be a mere man come in the flesh.<a name=246:15></a> This could not be said of a mere human being.<a name=246:16></a> If a man say, I am come in the flesh, I should ask, What else could you come in?<a name=246:17></a> That is what you are: you are a mere man.<a name=246:18></a> But whosoever shall "confess not Jesus Christ come in the flesh, this is a deceiver and an antichrist.<a name=246:19></a>" Perfect Man, He is infinitely more.<a name=246:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Look to yourselves.<a name=246:21></a>" If they had all departed away, his work would have been burnt with fire.<a name=246:22></a> And therefore he says, "Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.<a name=246:23></a>" The reward of labour in that sense is for the work that he has done in the souls of others.<a name=246:24></a> As it is said of the Lord Jesus, "he shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied"; so we in our little measure receive it.<a name=246:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we have a little more.<a name=246:26></a> After having spoken about these deceivers, he adds, "Whosoever goeth forward and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God.<a name=246:27></a>" If you have not got the true Christ, you have not God at all.<a name=246:28></a> That is the first great broad principle.<a name=246:29></a> All through John, when he is speaking of relationship, it is the Son; but if of nature, it is God, not the Father.<a name=246:30></a> In John 8 it is God; and Jesus takes that place -- "Before Abraham was, I am.<a name=246:31></a>" There may be the rejection of the truth, and then I have not God in any; I am outside the whole scene in which this grace is displayed.<a name=246:32></a> I have not the doctrine of Christ, that is, the truth as to Christ; I have not got God at all.<a name=246:33></a> "He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.<a name=246:34></a>" He gets the whole unfolding of this unspeakable grace.<a name=246:35></a> It is the perfect revelation of God in its own blessedness within itself, not outside, but you have God inside; and you have got here all blessedness, in which the Father loves the Son and has given the Son for us; you have got both the Father and the Son.<a name=246:36></a> "Truly, our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ.<a name=246:37></a>" .<a name=246:38></a>.<a name=246:39></a>.<a name=246:40></a> "If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie and do not the truth.<a name=246:41></a>" He has not communion with God, because God's nature is light.<a name=246:42></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=247>[Page 247]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You have, firstly, the great fact of not having God at all; a man is absolutely without God if he has not Christ.<a name=247:1></a> Then, secondly, when he unfolds the truth, it is the Father and the Son.<a name=247:2></a> He urges decision upon these saints.<a name=247:3></a> "If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed.<a name=247:4></a>" To do so would be encouraging and helping him; it is to tamper with my own conscience, because I am allowing something to be Christ which is a false one, and the deepest dishonour to God.<a name=247:5></a> If I shew this appearance of love where the truth is not, it is not Christ at all; it is denying Him, and saying that what is false is as good as what is true.<a name=247:6></a> It is helping the Antichrist and not the Christ.<a name=247:7></a> "Him that biddeth him God speed" (that is, literally salutes him on going away), "is partaker of his evil deeds.<a name=247:8></a>" It was a sign of recognition and companionship.<a name=247:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper and ink; but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.<a name=247:10></a>" I get there another thing, that is, the kind of affection which should reign among the saints.<a name=247:11></a> It was not a sort of mere abstract love; but there was gladness in seeing them, real comfort in it, and rejoicing to see them doing well.<a name=247:12></a> The Holy Ghost always encourages this activity of love, however strong He may be for the truth.<a name=247:13></a> Christ has come into the world: the one point round which souls can rally and find God in grace.<a name=247:14></a> When anything unsettles that, there is no resource at all.<a name=247:15></a> If Satan cannot do anything by persecution, he tries to unsettle souls about the truth in Christ.<a name=247:16></a> He is a roaring lion, going about seeking whom he may devour; that is persecution.<a name=247:17></a> But he is not always a roaring lion.<a name=247:18></a> When he comes in as a serpent (that is, when he steals along, and does not roar at all), it is a great deal more dangerous.<a name=247:19></a> A person is tried by his violence and rage; but it is far more serious when we have to withstand the wiles of the devil.<a name=247:20></a> Still, wherever Christ is held to simply, all is simple.<a name=247:21></a> Here it is the case of a lady.<a name=247:22></a> It is personal faith that clings to Christ for His own sake.<a name=247:23></a> The person may not be wise enough to set the world right, but there is something that faith clings to.<a name=247:24></a> I must have Christ.<a name=247:25></a> The secret of all is the individual personal faith that holds fast to Christ and His truth.<a name=247:26></a> It is a wonderful mercy to have that which is a test of everything, and a proof of Christ's love.<a name=247:27></a> To have a clear and distinct object this carries me through, according to God's mind, this is what Christ walked in; and if we hold fast to Christ, it is always true.<a name=247:28></a>

		NOTES ON THE THIRD EPISTLE OF JOHN
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have here the same great principle in general that we saw in the Second Epistle -- that is, loving the truth.<a name=249:1></a> Only there John was warning against any one that transgressed the doctrine of Christ, and here he is rather encouraging gracious ways and-liberality towards those that were going about with the truth.<a name=249:2></a>

		There is here the kindness that works among Christians.<a name=249:3></a> He desires that Gaius might prosper and be in health, even as his soul prospered.<a name=249:4></a> This Gaius received the brethren that went about preaching the word, and Diotrephes was jealous of them.<a name=249:5></a> He not only refused to receive the brethren himself, but hindered those that would.<a name=249:6></a> There was resistance to the free witness to God rendered by these persons going about.<a name=249:7></a> "Because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.<a name=249:8></a>" They went out freely, trusting the Lord, and Diotrephes would not have such things.<a name=249:9></a> So he not only would not receive them himself, but if other people did, he forbade them, and cast them out of the church.<a name=249:10></a> The Apostle writes to strengthen Gaius in the spirit of hearty welcome in receiving them.<a name=249:11></a>

		With Diotrephes it was love of prominence, a fleshly desire in him, and this even rose so high that he was speaking against the apostle.<a name=249:12></a> Still, the main point that the apostle dwells on, in writing to Gaius, is that he was in the truth.<a name=249:13></a> It is remarkable in John that, while he speaks of love, he always guards it in the most definite way by what he calls "the truth.<a name=249:14></a>" Real charity is in God Himself.<a name=249:15></a> He is love, and wherever love is real, it must be guarded by the truth as it is in Jesus, or it is not of God.<a name=249:16></a> Therefore, before he commends Gaius for his love and hospitality to the brethren, he says, "I rejoiced greatly when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.<a name=249:17></a>" This is the first thing he dwells upon, before he even speaks of what he does to the brethren and to strangers.<a name=249:18></a>

		The great purpose of God, in all His dealings in grace, is to bring us -- and to bring us individually too -- into fellowship with Himself.<a name=253:1></a> "Truly our fellowship is with the Father.<a name=253:2></a>" Thus we have the full knowledge of God, as far as it can be known by men, and that in full communion with Himself: not in the way of creation -- that is, not merely as creatures, but in "union"; and we are made partakers of the Holy Ghost that there may be power; "we dwell in him and he in us.<a name=253:3></a>" There cannot be anything more intimate.<a name=253:4></a>
	</div>

		It is not knowledge or science that has anything to do with this; for if it be but the human mind working on the things of God, it is but that "high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God.<a name=253:5></a>" Babes in Christ have possession of these things, they have not to seek for them, they are in possession of them, though of course they have to ripen in acquaintance with them.<a name=253:6></a> Knowledge itself, mere knowledge, puffs up; but, being brought low, the Spirit of God can act upon the soul and give knowledge in communion with God.<a name=253:7></a>

		Although the Epistle of John is very abstract, yet it is abstract about things that the very feeblest saint knows in Christ.<a name=253:8></a> God is brought down to our nature, for God can come down to us in our weakness in Christ.<a name=253:9></a> The difference between the writings of Paul and John is this, that Paul unfolds to us the counsels of God in creation -- the counsels of God towards the Jews (there are various developments of Christ's Person, as in Hebrews and Colossians); but John may be called more abstract, because he speaks of the nature of God Himself.<a name=253:10></a> The purpose and object of God is to bring us into full fellowship with Himself.<a name=253:11></a>

		Now comes the other side, the grace having been all brought out.<a name=275:1></a> This is that which was from the beginning (mark the word); now what does he reveal?<a name=275:2></a> He has a message, "that God is light," which is, that He is absolute purity, and reveals everything.<a name=275:3></a> This is what light does, it makes all things manifest.<a name=275:4></a> "God is light and in him is no darkness at all" -- no mixture.<a name=275:5></a> "If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness, we lie and do not the truth.<a name=275:6></a>" It is the nature of God in its purity, applied as a test of communion.<a name=275:7></a> This is the message that Christ has brought, that God is light.<a name=275:8></a> And we walk in the light -- that is, in the thorough knowledge of God.<a name=275:9></a> Darkness is no knowledge of God at all.<a name=275:10></a> If I take the world, the light shines in darkness, and the darkness comprehends it not.<a name=275:11></a> That is, man's heart was the very opposite of God's.<a name=275:12></a> "Ye were sometime darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord.<a name=275:13></a>" "If we walk in the light" -- here it is not merely according to the light, but "in the light," that is, the full revelation of God, though of course we ought to walk accordingly.<a name=275:14></a>

		Now mark another point of importance.<a name=275:15></a> It is an entirely new thing that is given to us; it is that which was "from the beginning.<a name=275:16></a>" It is not as in the Gospel -- "in the beginning"; because the Word is before the creation.<a name=275:17></a> In the beginning God created; but before this Christ was there and had no beginning: when nothing was created He was -- that is where the Gospel begins.<a name=275:18></a> But here we have got a question of associating man with God in a new standing, that is, in grace, and this is what was "from the beginning.<a name=275:19></a>" The old man is set aside; it is a new start-point, God's Son, still a man.<a name=275:20></a> He is the First-born, the man of God's delight and God's counsels; others are brought into the place by grace.<a name=275:21></a> But the cross has come in and closed the history of man as a lost sinner, and begun the history of the accepted man -- that is, of Christ.<a name=275:22></a> "Let that therefore abide in you which ye have heard from the beginning" -- it is Christ.<a name=275:23></a> The law and the prophets were before Him, but are all entirely set aside for faith; and, Christ taking the place of everything, I have got that which was from the beginning.<a name=275:24></a> "Jehovah possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old; it was then I was by him as one brought up with him, and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him.<a name=275:25></a>" Therefore the angels say "glory to God in the highest, on earth peace, good pleasure in men," Luke 2.<a name=275:26></a>

		Now, dealing in detail as to this fellowship with God, God is light; where therefore there is growth, if there is a thing in which the flesh is active, this comes to the light.<a name=276:1></a> The Person with whom I have fellowship is light; the light detects if my conscience is right.<a name=276:2></a> I cannot have fellowship really without my conscience being brought into the light.<a name=276:3></a> He unfolds this both as to the nature, and as to the acting of it.<a name=276:4></a> We have to walk in the light as God is in the light.<a name=276:5></a> We could not have got it in Adam, blessed and happy and peaceful as he was; but here I have got it.<a name=276:6></a> Christ is the revelation of God in light; and if I am made partaker of the divine nature, it is in the last Adam.<a name=276:7></a> "In him was life, and the life was the light of men; and the light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not.<a name=276:8></a>" Darkness does not comprehend light, but light that is of the same nature does.<a name=276:9></a>

		Thus it is in John 13.<a name=276:17></a> In the chapter before "the hour is come that the Son of man should be glorified.<a name=276:18></a>" It is the third character in which He is presented in these chapters -- as Son of man.<a name=276:19></a> The Greeks come up, and He says, "except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone.<a name=276:20></a>" Then in chapter 13, "He riseth from supper and laid aside his garment and took a towel and girded himself.<a name=276:21></a>" What was the meaning of that?<a name=276:22></a> "If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me" -- I cannot sit with you as your companion: I cannot go on; I am going to my Father, and I must have you fit to be there.<a name=276:23></a> You are going through the world and will pick up dirt, and I cannot have it.<a name=276:24></a> He is shewing this, that it is not now any return to a condition of man, responsible as man, but to walk in the light, even as God is in the light.<a name=276:25></a> If I am not fit for that, I cannot be with God at all.<a name=276:26></a> There is where the difficulties come in.<a name=276:27></a> It is not the question can I answer to God?<a name=276:28></a> No, I cannot.<a name=276:29></a> The veil is rent now: the question is, Have you got such a new condition and standing that you can be in the light with God, where the flesh cannot be?<a name=276:30></a> There is where He puts us.<a name=276:31></a><a name=277>[Page 277]</a>

		"If we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another.<a name=277:1></a>" There is no selfishness there.<a name=277:2></a> Suppose I enjoy the love of God, do you think bringing another in makes it less?<a name=277:3></a> No; you enjoy the light, and it is not a bit the less for others.<a name=277:4></a> In human things, if I have a loaf and another comes in to share it, there is only half a loaf left for me.<a name=277:5></a> In divine things we have fellowship one with another, and there is no diminution.<a name=277:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then I come to the third point.<a name=277:7></a> Here I am in the light as God is, in this blessed fellowship, "and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.<a name=277:8></a>" It is not 'has cleansed' or 'will cleanse,' but very simply an abstract statement; just as when I say 'that medicine cures the ague,' I am talking of its nature.<a name=277:9></a> I have to do with God in the light as He is in the light.<a name=277:10></a> I have got this blessed knowledge, that the light has come out through the cross, and I am as white as snow.<a name=277:11></a> The thing that let out the light made me fit for it.<a name=277:12></a> Thus there are these three great elements of my condition -- in the light as God is, the fellowship of the Spirit, and the blood of Jesus that cleanses from all sin.<a name=277:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.<a name=277:14></a>" I cannot say the flesh is not there (it is not sinning), but the existence of sin in the flesh does not give a bad conscience.<a name=277:15></a> My conscience is bad (I mean practically) if I let the sin, the flesh, act.<a name=277:16></a> The old man in its nature is always there.<a name=277:17></a> In the cross of Christ I have what meets the case -- our old man is crucified with Him, and I have to reckon it dead; but still there it is in itself too truly.<a name=277:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then I get the next step.<a name=277:19></a> Suppose it does act -- "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.<a name=277:20></a>" It is not "if we confess our sin" -- I have nothing to do with confessing sin.<a name=277:21></a> People will confess their sin, not their sins; for the heart is deceitful enough to excuse the sins by admitting sin in the flesh.<a name=277:22></a> I admit the flesh is there; but why did not you keep it down in the power of Christ so as not to let it act?<a name=277:23></a> Therefore it is we have to confess our sins: and mark, we have to walk with that.<a name=277:24></a> When he speaks of sin (verse 8), it is the present tense; I never can say I have no sin: but when of sins it is, "if we say that we have not sinned" (verse 10).<a name=277:25></a> I ought not to be sinning; I may be thinking of the blessedness of Christ.<a name=277:26></a> If so, I am not sinning; my mind may be occupied with Him.<a name=277:27></a> But if I say that I have not sinned, I make God a liar, because He declares all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.<a name=277:28></a> Here I get the distinction.<a name=277:29></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is surprising that people do not see the difference between 'sin' and 'sins.<a name=278:1></a>' Peter speaks of sinning, that is, of the lust that comes when the flesh is active; but when I come to Paul and John, they speak of the nature of the flesh, of sin in the flesh.<a name=278:2></a> "If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us: if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.<a name=278:3></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		Observe in the Epistle to the Hebrews, it is not communion exactly which is the main object of the teaching there.<a name=278:4></a> Here it is, and therefore I get the Father and the Son, the highest expression of it.<a name=278:5></a> In Hebrews I enter into the holiest.<a name=278:6></a> It is a question of whether I can approach God who is holy and righteous, and does not give up His holiness and righteousness because He is love; and there I get this, that I am perfected for ever (the words "for ever" meaning not merely for eternity, but what is uninterrupted).<a name=278:7></a> As Christ is always at the right hand of God, so we are uninterruptedly before God.<a name=278:8></a> There is never a moment that the believer is not the righteousness of God as standing in Christ.<a name=278:9></a> Therefore priesthood in the Epistle to the Hebrews does not apply to sins.<a name=278:10></a> What it does apply to is this: -- I am perfected for ever and He who is my righteousness, by whom I am perfected for ever, has sat down at the right hand of God.<a name=278:11></a> But I am here walking in this world, where I cannot take a step without mercy and grace to help.<a name=278:12></a> I have difficulties and trials; I go to the throne of God and get help in time of need.<a name=278:13></a> The thing in Hebrews is whether I can go as a mere sinner into God's presence.<a name=278:14></a> Yes, the veil is rent, and the Person that put away my sins is sitting there.<a name=278:15></a> He is my witness that I am perfect -- "for by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified" -- a perfection that never changes, for He is sitting there for me, "expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.<a name=278:16></a>" He is sitting there because He has nothing more to do.<a name=278:17></a> There are these two points in the Epistle: having by Himself purged our sins, He sat down; and, being perfected for ever, I am walking on this earth with temptation, but He is always getting grace to help me through this world of difficulty and contradiction of sinners.<a name=278:18></a> There is a daily dependence on grace to help me to walk a holy life, without a question of my being perfect before God, and the constant supply of grace through Christ who is there.<a name=278:19></a>

		Now here the question is raised of how I can have fellowship with the light, where, if I have for a moment a thought not spiritual or charitable, it is sin.<a name=279:1></a> The instant I come to fellowship or communion, if I let my own thoughts come in, it is gone.<a name=279:2></a> The smallest thing interrupts communion; even supposing I recollect myself, yet for the moment it is gone.<a name=279:3></a> The holy God cannot have communion with that which is unholy.<a name=279:4></a> Now I get what Christ is as the Advocate: "if any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous, and he is the propitiation for our sins.<a name=279:5></a>" What is the ground of it?<a name=279:6></a> Jesus Christ the righteous.<a name=279:7></a> The righteous One is there, my righteousness is always there (as in the Hebrews).<a name=279:8></a> Thus not a question of imputation arises, but of communion.<a name=279:9></a> I cannot bear the thought that I should grieve the Spirit of God and turn Him into a reprover, instead of communicating the joy of God to me, the One that gives me fellowship with the Father.<a name=279:10></a> The moment that is all settled, Jesus Christ the righteous One is there, and He is the propitiation for my sins, I must not have one thought that is inconsistent with the place.<a name=279:11></a> But what makes me find it out?<a name=279:12></a> My Advocate has been there about it to bring my soul back into fellowship with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ, which had been entirely interrupted: but the righteousness has not been interrupted.<a name=279:13></a> Therefore he says "an Advocate with the Father," and does not talk about God in that sense, because it is a question of communion with the Father, not of righteousness.<a name=279:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus I have got grace acting, not the law; no question of imputation, but no allowance of sin at all as a matter of holiness.<a name=279:15></a> It does not put me back to the law, nor its righteousness; but Christ being Advocate for me there, and the Spirit of God in me to act in my conscience, it brings me into utter humiliation before God, and restores the communion of my soul.<a name=279:16></a> Some chastening or other comes.<a name=279:17></a> But there is not the smallest allowance of anything that hinders communion.<a name=279:18></a> nor the smallest imputation of sins.<a name=279:19></a> It is the maintenance of communion practically, or the restoration of it when broken, with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ; while the righteousness and propitiation remain, so that it is advocacy, not imputation.<a name=279:20></a>

		THE LOVE OF GOD, THE LOVE OF SAINTS, AND OVERCOMING THE WORLD
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1 John 4 and 5
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God's love, in contrast with man's is distinguished by this, that while man must have something to drew out his love (as it is said, "For a good man some would even dare to die; but God commendeth his love to usward, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us"), God's love is without motive, there being nothing attractive in the object that draws it out.<a name=285:1></a> "In due time Christ died for the ungodly.<a name=285:2></a>" God's love sees no good in us.<a name=285:3></a> The brightest proof of God's love and man's enmity was seen in the cross: they met there, and thus shewed the superiority of God's love; as Jethro says, "In the thing wherein they dealt proudly He was above them.<a name=285:4></a>" Verse 9 sets out the open manifestation of His love to us while we were yet sinners.<a name=285:5></a> We learn His purposes and counsels about us as saints, in the second place, in verse 17 -- "Herein is love with us made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment, because as he is so are we in this world.<a name=285:6></a>" This is a very different thing from His first visiting us in our sins.<a name=285:7></a> "Herein is love with us made perfect.<a name=285:8></a>" The perfectness of God's love towards His saints is seen in the bringing them to be like Christ Himself.<a name=285:9></a> The sovereign grace of God puts the saint into the same place as Christ, that we may have the same kind of fellowship with the Father that Christ had.<a name=285:10></a> So in John 14 the Lord says, "My peace I give unto you" -- that is, the peace He had with His Father -- "not as the world giveth give I unto you.<a name=285:11></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The world has the character of a benefactor; and that it sometimes gives generously I do not deny.<a name=285:12></a> But then it is by helping a man as he is, out of the resources which it has, which may be all very well; yet, while helping him, it is only taking care of itself.<a name=285:13></a> But it is evidently a different thing here; for Christ takes us clean out of our condition, putting us into the same relationship with the Father as Himself.<a name=285:14></a> The world cannot give in this way.<a name=285:15></a> There is no guarding anything for self in Christ's unjealous love, but in us there is.<a name=285:16></a> Therefore He could say, "Not as the world giveth give I unto you.<a name=285:17></a>" His delight was to shew that the Father loved them as He loved Him.<a name=285:18></a> "The glory thou hast given me I have given them, that the world may know that thou hast loved them as thou hast loved me.<a name=285:19></a>" Jesus not only loves them Himself, but He will have it known by the world that they are loved by the Father as He Himself is loved.<a name=285:20></a> Can there be anything more disinterested than this (although the word "disinterested" fails to give the full meaning)?<a name=285:21></a> Still all this is guarded, for Christ ever keeps His place as the eternal Son of God.<a name=285:22></a> At the mount of transfiguration, the moment there is the question of putting Moses and Elias on an equality with Jesus, they both disappear, for when Peter said, Let us make three tabernacles, one for Moses and one for Elias, as well as one for the Lord, while he thus spake there came a cloud and overshadowed them, and instantly the glorified men vanished.<a name=285:23></a> "And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.<a name=285:24></a>" It is not said "hear them," but "hear him.<a name=285:25></a>" "And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone.<a name=285:26></a>"

		If Christ, in His wondrous grace, reveals Moses and Elias as His companions and associates in the glory, the moment Peter, in his foolishness, gives utterance to the thought that would place them on an equality with Christ, they must both vanish from the scene.<a name=286:1></a> It does not say, as the Father loved them, but as "he has loved me" (as a man).<a name=286:2></a> For however Christ may bring us unto the same place with Himself, He abides the object of homage and honour, even as the Father.<a name=286:3></a> If we elevate ourselves to an equality with Christ, immediately we set ourselves above Him.<a name=286:4></a> And it is ever the case thus with flesh.<a name=286:5></a> But the more a saint enters into his elevation, as being brought by grace into the same place with Christ, the more he adores Christ as God over all, blessed for evermore.<a name=286:6></a> This is ever to be borne in mind.<a name=286:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The thought in verse 17, "as he is, so are we in this world," is that the saints are in the same place as Christ.<a name=286:8></a> If I have righteousness, it is a divine righteousness: "We are made the righteousness of God in him.<a name=286:9></a>" If I have life, it is a divine eternal life: "when Christ who is our life shall appear.<a name=286:10></a>" If I have glory, it is the same glory: "the glory thou hast given me, I have given them.<a name=286:11></a>" If we have an inheritance, we are "joint-heirs with Christ"; if love, it is the same love wherewith the Father loved Christ: "Thou hast loved them as thou hast loved me.<a name=286:12></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The love is the most difficult thing for us to enter into, but the Lord would have our hearts enjoying it.<a name=286:13></a> All that we have in Christ is brought out in this passage, in the general expression, "as he is, so are we.<a name=286:14></a>" It is the thought and purpose of God's grace to bless us not only by Christ, but with Christ.<a name=286:15></a> Christ could not be satisfied unless it was so, we being the fruit and travail of His soul: "Father, I will that they also whom thou hast given me be with me": again, "I will come again, and receive you unto myself, that where I am there ye may be also.<a name=286:16></a>" The Father's love is seen in giving His Son for us, and the Son's love in His giving Himself for us, and thus bringing us into His perfect place.<a name=286:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Some Christians do not give this verse 17 all its power; they refer it simply to our position before God respecting the day of judgment.<a name=287:1></a> Whatever judgment may come, the saint has nothing to do with it, for where there is a question about judgment there can be no boldness.<a name=287:2></a> There is nothing more comforting than the perfect confidence of having God as my Father.<a name=287:3></a> I cannot get the affections in full play if I think God is going to judge me; but I have the Spirit of adoption, and if I sin or do wrong, I run to my Father directly, because I know my Father is not going to judge me for it; for God is my Father, and will not judge (save as a Father, now for my correction, by the way).<a name=287:4></a> Therefore boldness is needed for the exercise of the spiritual affections in me; and we ought to remember this, for Christians often shrink from it; but it is evident that, if I am hesitating whether God is going to bless me or to judge me, I cannot love Him.<a name=287:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then observe another thing -- there is a great difference between spiritual desires and spiritual affections, although they both have the same root.<a name=287:6></a> The spiritual desires, if the relationship which would meet them be not known, only produce sorrow.<a name=287:7></a> Take an orphan, for instance, in a family where the parent's love to the children is witnessed every day, the sorrowful experience would be, O, that I too had a father!<a name=287:8></a> The child who has its parent has the same desires; the relationship existing of parent and child, it knows the joy and gladness which flows from such relationship.<a name=287:9></a> So also that we may have joy and gladness as the children of God, we must have the consciousness of the relationship in which we stand to God.<a name=287:10></a> It is not merely that we have a divine nature which gives us spiritual desires, but we must also have the consciousness of the relationship into which we are brought by the power of what Christ has done.<a name=287:11></a> It is clear there never could be a question between Christ and His Father as to the daily and hourly enjoyment of the consciousness of His Father's love: "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.<a name=287:12></a>" So also He says, "My peace I give unto you.<a name=287:13></a>" Again he says, "that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.<a name=287:14></a>" The Father's delight was in Christ, and He knew it in the daily enjoyment of it.<a name=287:15></a> And now, "as he is, so are we in this world.<a name=287:16></a>"

		While Christ lays the ground of our relationship by being the propitiation for our sins and the source of our life, yet it is not by Christ's righteousness that I get "boldness.<a name=288:1></a>" I must be righteous, of course; I cannot have boldness without it; but besides this there is another character God has towards me -- that of a Father -- and I have another character towards God, as a child.<a name=288:2></a> I have not only righteousness, but I am a son.<a name=288:3></a> And here I should notice the defectiveness of some of our hymns which call Christ our brother.<a name=288:4></a> We never find in Scripture that Christ is called our Elder Brother.<a name=288:5></a> In the fulness of His grace He is not ashamed to own and call us His brethren.<a name=288:6></a> My father is a man, but I do not call him a man; it would shew a want of filial reverence in me if I did.<a name=288:7></a> In nothing is the power of the Spirit of God more shewn in the child of God than the suitableness of his expressions and feelings towards God.<a name=288:8></a> If we are really enjoying our place of infinite privilege, the Source and Giver of our privilege will maintain His own proper place in our hearts.<a name=288:9></a>

		"As he is, so are we in this world," not only in the same standing as to acceptance with God in Christ, but we are brought by the communication of His life into the same relationship as Himself.<a name=288:12></a> While in the beginning of the epistle the foundation is laid deep and wide in the blood which cleanses fully, still the grand subject of the epistle is the place into which we are brought.<a name=288:13></a> "Herein is love with us made perfect.<a name=288:14></a>" If my heart has seized the truth that God as a Father is acting in grace towards me, there is no place for fear.<a name=288:15></a> If I have fear I fly to Him, instead of being afraid of Him.<a name=288:16></a> If I sin, I fly to Him to pardon it.<a name=288:17></a> I could not in my sin fly to my judge, but I have confidence in my Father's love, and I fly to Him because "perfect love casteth out fear.<a name=288:18></a>" The proof of God's love is that He has given His Son; the perfection of it is, that we are as He is; and fear is cast out even in view of judgment.<a name=288:19></a> But if we ask how this came to pass, the answer is, "We love him because he first loved us" (verse 19).<a name=288:20></a> There we are brought back to the simplest principles: we love God because He first loved us.<a name=288:21></a> We did not come to God because of His loveliness; "we love him because he first loved us.<a name=288:22></a>" We do not come in by loving God (this we do after), but we come in as sinners, as debtors to His grace; and then, having come in, so finding God to be what He is -- love meeting us in our every need -- then we love Him.<a name=288:23></a>

		THE THREE WHO ARE WITNESSING: "THE SPIRIT, AND THE WATER, AND THE BLOOD"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1 John 5: 6-21
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the preceding verses the question between God and the world is brought to an issue; for the Son of God having been seen in the world, and in the world and by the world crucified -- thus putting the world to the test -- God could do nothing in the world in the hope of finding good in it, after it had crucified His Son.<a name=294:1></a> Jesus had to say, "O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee.<a name=294:2></a>" Having hung God's Son on the cross, it is plain that this act cut the world off from all possible association with God, and thus the world has become a thing to be overcome by the saint, as the apostle says (verse 5), "Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?<a name=294:3></a>" But he then adds, "This is he that came by water and blood.<a name=294:4></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is, he now presents the character and value of the cross, "He came by water and blood.<a name=294:5></a>" The water and the blood are as a witness on God's part, or the testimony that God gives; for it should be observed that the words, "witness," "record," and "testimony," are all the same word in the original.<a name=294:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You may remark here, that "This is the witness, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.<a name=294:7></a>" This is the thing witnessed.<a name=294:8></a> This is the record (or testimony) that God has given to us eternal life, and this life is in His Son.<a name=294:9></a> It is not in the first Adam, but in His Son; not in man, nor by his works, nor by any means whatever, but it is God's gift.<a name=294:10></a> "He hath given," and though we possess the life, it is not properly and intrinsically in us, but IN HIS SON.<a name=294:11></a> When we are quickened, the life is not looked at as in us; for Christ says, "Because I live, ye shall live also.<a name=294:12></a>" It is therefore immutable.<a name=294:13></a> If Christ's life, indeed, can in any way be annulled or set aside, then can the life in us be so likewise, and not otherwise.<a name=294:14></a> If Christ can die, so can we; but if death has no more dominion over Him, no more has it over us.<a name=294:15></a> And this it is that gives the amazing value and most blessed character of this life, namely, that its spring and source is in Christ.<a name=294:16></a> It is given to the Son to have life in Himself; John 5: 26.<a name=294:17></a> And thus He becomes, through grace, our life.<a name=294:18></a> For example, my finger has life, my natural life, flowing through it; but the seat of life is not there.<a name=294:19></a> My finger may be cut off, though I am not here supposing that a member of Christ can be cut off (which is impossible); but if my finger be cut off, the life still remains in my body, the seat of life not being in my finger.<a name=294:20></a> My finger was as much alive as the rest of my body, but the seat of life was not there.<a name=294:21></a> The seat of life is in Christ.<a name=294:22></a> "Our life is hid with Christ in God.<a name=294:23></a>" Hence all the character of the life and all the communion flows from the blessed truth -- "in his Son.<a name=294:24></a>" The character of this life is nearness to God.<a name=294:25></a> Christ Himself is my life.<a name=294:26></a> It is of the last importance for the strength and comfort of our souls, and for all blessed delight in God, clearly to understand what our life is; for our thoughts on regeneration are necessarily altogether imperfect until we apprehend that it is a real life which we have, a life associating us with God's Son, a life not possessed before, and in virtue of which we get communion with the Father, who has given us eternal life -- not in us, but "in his Son.<a name=294:27></a>"

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We get brought out in various testimonies what Christ is to us, as in 1 Corinthians 6: 9-11, where the apostle, speaking of the offscouring of the earth, says, "Such were some of you, but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.<a name=295:1></a>" And so here we get a corresponding testimony brought out in these three witnesses, the water, the blood, and the Spirit.<a name=295:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		In John 19: 34 it is recorded that "one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.<a name=295:3></a>" The blood and the water flowed from a dead Christ.<a name=295:4></a> Hence we see how manifestly the link between the natural man and God is broken, and broken for ever!<a name=295:5></a> For "in that he died, he died unto sin once.<a name=295:6></a>" All that Christ could have blessed in nature is now entirely and for ever gone; and if there is to be any blessing now, it must be in a new nature, and through a dead Christ; as also all connection and association with God.<a name=295:7></a> Expiation, purity, life, can alone be had through a dead Christ.<a name=295:8></a> It is a dead Christ that must purify me if I am to be purified; for it was from a dead Christ that the water (the symbol of cleansing) flowed.<a name=295:9></a> Until the death of Christ, God was dealing with nature, to see (or rather to teach us, for He knew what it was) if any good thing could come out of nature.<a name=295:10></a> But the cross proved -- God's rejected Son proved -- that it was not possible that any good thing could come out of nature.<a name=295:11></a> Man is not merely a sinner driven out of paradise, as we know Adam was; but man's state now results not only from his being turned out of God's presence because of sin, but from the will and energy of his evil nature, which has cast God out of His own world.<a name=295:12></a><a name=296>[Page 296]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The cross shews that man's nature is utterly incapable of being acted on by any motive whatever which could set it right.<a name=296:1></a> This is very humbling, yet very blessed.<a name=296:2></a> Heaven will not do; earth will not do; the law will not do.<a name=296:3></a> I have yet one thing in heaven -- My beloved Son: I will send Him.<a name=296:4></a> It may be they will reverence Him when they see Him.<a name=296:5></a> But no.<a name=296:6></a> The determination of man's will is to have the world without God.<a name=296:7></a> This is what man wants.<a name=296:8></a> He will not have God in any sense.<a name=296:9></a> Here it is brought to a climax; and the very worst display of Christendom will be just this.<a name=296:10></a> If any of you should be seeking pleasure in the world, you know you do not want to find God there; for if you did, it would upset it all.<a name=296:11></a> Thus are you saying in spirit, "Let us kill the heir, and the inheritance shall be ours.<a name=296:12></a>" You may not have lifted up your hand to slay God's Son, but you have turned Him out of your heart.<a name=296:13></a> Man's great abilities will be much more developed in the day that is just approaching than they have ever yet been, in trying to make the world go on thoroughly well without God.<a name=296:14></a> When was there ever a time when everything was going on so well, as men speak, such unity among nations as now, or such drawing out of resources?<a name=296:15></a> The cry is, "Peace, peace," -- by the energies and working of man's will without God.<a name=296:16></a> Man looks for progress in the philosophy, commerce, politics, and comfort of this world, but still there is in his heart a dread of the consequences of the progress of this self-will.<a name=296:17></a> Thus is fulfilled the apparent paradox of Scripture, the cry of peace combined with "men's hearts failing them for fear.<a name=296:18></a>" Now men would say this is a contradiction, but it is not; for while men are building up commerce and arts and science in the energy of self-will, who is there among them that would undertake to answer for the state of any nation in three years' time, or for even a much shorter period?<a name=296:19></a> Man is afraid of the working of self-will in his neighbour, though he likes to exert it in himself.<a name=296:20></a> But the Christian has learned that the question as to the world is settled in the rejection of Christ.<a name=296:21></a> At that moment it was all over with the world.<a name=296:22></a>

		The question between God and man is settled as to man himself; for not only is man turned out of paradise, but when God's Son came, they crucified Him, and now grace comes in; and the Christian goes outside the world to get, in God's rejected Son, the life which is to be had in Him alone.<a name=297:1></a> This is God's record that He has given to us eternal life, and this life is in His Son.<a name=297:2></a> Amidst all this turmoil and trouble where shall I get peace?<a name=297:3></a> The moment I see a pierced Christ, I have that which expiates and purifies.<a name=297:4></a> All this is not a theory, not a doctrine merely, but a reality; for the moment my conscience begins to work, I find that by nature I am separate from God; that my carnal mind is enmity against God; that it is not only the world that has crucified God's Son, but my sins pierced Him.<a name=297:5></a> This is an individual thing, for this is how individual souls are brought into the blessing.<a name=297:6></a> When I have real faith in what God's word tells me about my own evil, then the question arises, What am I to do?<a name=297:7></a> All that which makes me a mere moral man declares that I could have nothing to do with God; but through a pierced Christ I have three witnesses that I can have to do with God.<a name=297:8></a> The highest act of insolence that it was possible for man to do against God brought out the very thing that put guilt away, even the blood and water flowing from Christ's pierced side.<a name=297:9></a> Suppose it was but yesterday that I wielded the spear against Jesus, the very act that brought out my enmity brought that which put it away.<a name=297:10></a> I cannot estimate sin aright until I see the water and blood flowing out of the pierced side of Christ, putting it away.<a name=297:11></a> But then I must be brought to the consciousness that I in spirit was there; my enmity to God did it; my sins pierced Him.<a name=297:12></a> It was thus God addressed the Jews, telling them that they had killed the heir; that is, their hearts had consented to it.<a name=297:13></a> Those Jews whom Peter addressed, saying, "Ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain," had not actually murdered the Prince of life.<a name=297:14></a> They had not held the spear any more than you did; but in the same spirit they refused Christ a place in their hearts; and it is thus God deals with the world.<a name=297:15></a> His question with the world is, "What have you done with my Son?<a name=297:16></a>" As with Cain, "Where is Abel thy brother?<a name=297:17></a>" And the only answer they can give is, "We have slain him.<a name=297:18></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The moment the Messiah was rejected, that moment all title to the promises was lost to the Jews.<a name=297:19></a> All hope of salvation -- everything is now gone from them as a people; and now, if they would get blessing, they must come in as sinners, and have their sins put away by the blood that flowed from the pierced side of their Messiah.<a name=297:20></a> Now then, as all title on the part of man to anything is gone, God is giving eternal life.<a name=297:21></a> God must direct the heart away from itself (except to the sense of its sinfulness) to Christ.<a name=297:22></a> Have I estimated my own sin as the murderer of Christ?<a name=297:23></a> Well, the blood has put the sin away; for the blood has cleansed the man who held the spear that pierced His side.<a name=297:24></a> We are nothing but sin; well, Christ was made sin for us, and through a dead Christ we get the blood as a witness that our sins are all put away; the blood being a witness of the perfect expiation of all sin.<a name=297:25></a> Christ "hath put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.<a name=297:26></a>" Here, however, it is not looking at the part man took in it, but at what Christ came into the world for, and which He accomplished.<a name=297:27></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There is, however, the water as well as the blood, and what is that?<a name=298:1></a> The water cleanses as the blood expiates: "that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word.<a name=298:2></a>" While the blood expiates, the water cleanses.<a name=298:3></a> The water bears witness to the same life-giving power.<a name=298:4></a> "Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.<a name=298:5></a>" The Spirit of God is the source of life and the power of the word, and gives life.<a name=298:6></a> Practically the word is the instrument, the incorruptible seed; and it is also a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart; and it is that by which God's thoughts are communicated to us.<a name=298:7></a> And it is out of the pierced side of Christ that these testimonies of God flow, thus writing death upon every production of nature.<a name=298:8></a> For it is not a modifying of the nature which now exists that the cross brings in, but the counting everything outside Christ to be dead, as there is not a thought, lust, or desire about the world upon which Christ does not write death; and thus it is that we get altogether new affections, "dead unto sin, but alive unto God," through the life in His Son.<a name=298:9></a> And the real character of purifying is this writing death upon everything that flows not from a pierced Christ.<a name=298:10></a> The water is the purification, but the purification is through a dead Christ.<a name=298:11></a> Christ all His life through was the pattern in man of what man ought to be; but our participating in this could only be by the cleansing of His death.<a name=298:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is a third thing -- we have not only the blood which expiates, and the water which purifies, through which we are dead to sin, but He has obtained for us the Spirit, the presence of the Holy Ghost, as the power of the word.<a name=298:13></a> It may, perhaps, be objected, I do not find myself thus dead to sin and purified.<a name=298:14></a> But you have a hatred to sin, which is a proof of your having died to it.<a name=298:15></a> And "In that Christ died, he died unto sin once, so likewise RECKON ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin"; for God ever treats us according to what He has really given us, treating us as though we had realised it all.<a name=298:16></a> So in John, the Lord says, "and whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.<a name=298:17></a>" Now they did know HIM who was truly the way to the Father, yet Thomas objected and said, "We know not the way," because they had never realised it.<a name=298:18></a> The instant I believe in Jesus, I am called on to reckon myself dead.<a name=298:19></a> I am never told to die, but I am told to mortify my members that are upon the earth.<a name=298:20></a> But I am never told to die.<a name=298:21></a> A man under the law will be trying to die with all his might, but he will never succeed.<a name=298:22></a> A Christian is dead, and his life is hid with Christ in God, and therefore he mortifies his members which are upon the earth, as living in the power of the life he has in the Son of God.<a name=298:23></a>

		The heart is constantly looking for God to give it a testimony about itself; but God is giving a testimony about His Son, and not about what we are; if God were to give a testimony about us, it must be about our sin and unbelief of heart.<a name=300:6></a> But no; and it is of great importance in this day of infidelity to see that if God gives a testimony, it is about His Son, and what He is to the sinner.<a name=300:7></a> If you believe that, you will get peace.<a name=300:8></a>

		If I am going about to get a standing before God on the ground of my holiness, this would be self-righteousness, and of course I shall not get a witness from God as to that.<a name=300:9></a> But if my soul takes its stand with God, on the testimony God has given to His Son, then I get the witness in myself: when I have got this faith, I have got the thing in my own soul.<a name=300:10></a> For instance, look at Paul before Agrippa: "I would to God that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.<a name=300:11></a>" He was so thoroughly conscious that the Christ in his soul was the Christ in heaven, and he was so happy in this consciousness, that he wished the whole company were like himself (except the bonds), having Christ, and a well of water springing up within.<a name=300:12></a> That which makes heaven to be a heaven to the saint is just this, that he finds the same Christ in heaven that he has in his own soul; and all the subtleties of infidelity cannot touch the soul that possesses Christ thus within.<a name=300:13></a> No reasoning of an infidel can shake my confidence if I am happy in Christ; for if a man came to tell me there was no Christ, when my soul was happy in Him, I should not believe him.<a name=300:14></a> There may be no intellectual or logical proof on my part, but there will be, to a certain extent, a moral testimony in the happiness of my soul, and the warmth of my affections being centred in Christ.<a name=300:15></a> I have often found how much it tells with men of all conditions to assure them that I am perfectly happy in Christ, and quite sure of going to heaven.<a name=300:16></a> Are you so?<a name=300:17></a> they say; I only wish I could say it.<a name=300:18></a> It would not be a proof to an infidel, his merely seeing you were happy; but it comes home to the heart of man, as there is a craving in man's heart that will never be met till he gets Christ there; for man is never happy without Christ, whatever he may say.<a name=300:19></a>

		NOTES ON THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The leading subject of the First Epistle of John is the life of God manifested upon earth in the Person of the Son, and communicated to man by Him -- this life being the basis of intercourse between man and God.<a name=304:1></a> The exposition of this blessed subject is accompanied by numerous unfoldings occupying a large place in this Epistle; still the fundamental subject is -- "God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.<a name=304:2></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The whole doctrine of the Epistle is set forth in chapter 1, and verses 1, 2 of chapter 2.<a name=304:3></a> These three consecutive truths are found there; namely, divine life communicated to man, and our introduction into communion with the Father and the Son, in virtue of that life (chapter 1: 1-4); the nature of the God with whom we are in communion (chapter 1: 5-10); and the means ordered by God for maintaining us in communion.<a name=304:4></a> Chapter 2: 1, 2.<a name=304:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the portion contained between chapter 2: 3, and chapter 3: 23, John considers the experimental and practical proof of the reality of the life in us.<a name=304:6></a> From chapter 3: 24 to chapter 4: 21 he unfolds the extent of our privilege as recipients of life, and enjoying communion with God, the privilege of God dwelling in us, and of us in Him.<a name=304:7></a> Lastly, in chapter 5 he considers the subject in its connection with the testimony of God and faith.<a name=304:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Various elucidations and observations on the subject of antichrists and false teachers are scattered throughout the whole Epistle; warning against the Gnostics, who at that time were undermining the faith of the saints.<a name=304:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		CHAPTER 1
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verses 1-4.<a name=304:10></a> The fulness of the grace which is in Christ: the Son has brought us that eternal life which was with the Father.<a name=304:11></a> There is a complete exposition of this truth in these few verses, a general statement introductory to the Epistle.<a name=304:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 1.<a name=304:13></a> "That which was from the beginning .<a name=304:14></a>.<a name=304:15></a>.<a name=304:16></a> which we have seen with our eyes .<a name=304:17></a>.<a name=304:18></a>.<a name=304:19></a> and our hands have handled of the Word of life.<a name=304:20></a>" It is the testimony of eye-witnesses, the apostle's language suited to the circumstances of the saints, who were at that time threatened by the heresy of the Gnostics.<a name=304:21></a> These latter laid claim to development; they said, The Gospels have given us the truth in germ, and now we possess the development of it.<a name=304:22></a> Not so, replies the apostle of God, we possess that which was in the beginning, and it is great and perfect enough to admit of no development.<a name=304:23></a> The heretics denied also that the Christ had come in flesh.<a name=304:24></a> John affirms the contrary in saying: we have seen Him and have handled Him.<a name=304:25></a>

		Verse 2.<a name=305:1></a> This verse is parenthetical.<a name=305:2></a> "The life was manifested" in the Person of the Son come in flesh.<a name=305:3></a> "God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.<a name=305:4></a>" The life manifested in Christ is an object for faith.<a name=305:5></a> "He that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath the Son hath also the Father.<a name=305:6></a>" This is the objective side on which this truth is first presented.<a name=305:7></a> But it has also its subjective side: the life, which has been manifested here below by the Son, abides in us who have believed.<a name=305:8></a> "He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself.<a name=305:9></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us remark that the life has not in us an independent and isolated existence.<a name=305:10></a> Far from leaving us in such a state, it introduces us into communion with the Father.<a name=305:11></a> But, besides, this life is Christ Himself; Christ, who is in heaven, is also in us.<a name=305:12></a> Certainly there are effects of this life which are confined to our individuality, regeneration for instance, and other such blessings.<a name=305:13></a> But the life itself assumes in us a different existence, and, by its link with the source that produced it, presents something larger.<a name=305:14></a> The source of the life is Christ; the stream is in us, and the stream is not severed from the source.<a name=305:15></a> If a man said, speaking of his hand, "It lives," it would signify that his hand had an existence independently of the rest of his body.<a name=305:16></a> Doubtless the hand lives, but it lives by the life which animates the whole being to which it belongs.<a name=305:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"We shew unto you that eternal life which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us.<a name=305:18></a>" The apostles possessed this life by direct communication; the saints receive it by the testimony borne to this life.<a name=305:19></a> "That ye also may have fellowship with us" signifies that you may participate in the things which we, who have seen the Lord, enjoy.<a name=305:20></a> "And truly our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ.<a name=305:21></a>" The saints to whom these things are said knew already communion with the Father.<a name=305:22></a> John desired that they should enjoy their privilege, and therefore he brought it again before their notice.<a name=305:23></a> God has not only given us life, but it is His will that every kind of intercourse should exist between Himself and His children.<a name=305:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=306>[Page 306]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Our fellowship.<a name=306:1></a>" In virtue of the fact that we have life, we have the same affections, the same sentiments, the same thoughts as the Father and the Son.<a name=306:2></a> Jesus imparted to His disciples all the communications by which the Father testified His love to the Son.<a name=306:3></a> These blessed communications are also our portion, and we enjoy them in direct relation with the Father and the Son.<a name=306:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verses 5-10.<a name=306:5></a> Here we approach a second general truth.<a name=306:6></a> It being our privilege to enjoy communion with the Father and the Son, what is the God with whom we are in communion?<a name=306:7></a> For an answer we read this message: "God is light.<a name=306:8></a>" The God who has brought us into communion with Himself is the holy God.<a name=306:9></a> Such is His nature.<a name=306:10></a> Here we notice that when John speaks of God in connection with the work of grace, he uses the expression, "the Father and the Son"; when he speaks of His nature, he says "God.<a name=306:11></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 5.<a name=306:12></a> "This then is the message.<a name=306:13></a>" The apostles, who looked upon the life in the Son and declared it for the blessing and joy of the saints, have also heard the message whereby God reveals that He is light, and they declare that also.<a name=306:14></a> "God is light.<a name=306:15></a>" The life which we have received and by which we have entered into communion with the Father and the Son, has emanated from God who is light, and by this life we are placed in that light.<a name=306:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 6.<a name=306:17></a> In this verse and those following, John confirms by contrasts the truths he has just put forth, and submits them to a counter-proof.<a name=306:18></a> In the grace whereby He introduces us into His communion, God gives up none of His attributes, none of His rights.<a name=306:19></a> "God is light," and if we walk in darkness there is no communion between us and Him.<a name=306:20></a> To pretend to have fellowship with Him whilst walking in darkness is to fail of the truth of God, and to lie.<a name=306:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 7.<a name=306:22></a> But if we walk in the light, we realise blessed communion.<a name=306:23></a> In order to enjoy it we must walk in the light, and not merely according to the light.<a name=306:24></a> Being in the light we are with God, and there is no place for sin there; and besides the light reveals sin and judges it.<a name=306:25></a> "We have fellowship one with another" signifies our mutual communion.<a name=306:26></a> "The blood of Jesus Christ, his Son, cleanseth us from all sin.<a name=306:27></a>" By the existence of sin there is a difficulty to communion as a real thing; but the blood of Christ has removed this difficulty, it answers before God for the condition of man.<a name=306:28></a> To be cleansed from all sin is to be conscious of being without spot before God, in virtue of the blood of Christ.<a name=306:29></a> This spiritual state of the saints only exists through the gospel.<a name=306:30></a> Under law the worshippers retained a conscience of sins; the ineffectual offerings of bulls and of goats could give them no other standing.<a name=306:31></a> But ours is very different and far better.<a name=306:32></a> We possess that infinite grace which, through the sprinkling of the blood of Christ, places us with a purged conscience in the light of the presence of God, with a capacity for enjoying the fellowship of one another also God.<a name=306:33></a>

		<a name=307>[Page 307]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Is the child of God sprinkled by blood several times?<a name=307:1></a> No, for the sprinkling of the blood upon the believer answers to the shedding of blood accomplished once for all before God, neither is repeated.<a name=307:2></a> It is important that the Christian should hold fast a true sense of the value of the blood of Christ offered once.<a name=307:3></a> Otherwise we sink into Jewish elements, and for every failure we seek a fresh sprinkling.<a name=307:4></a> Now this is precisely the state which the apostle contrasts with the conscience perfected by the blood of Christ; Hebrews 10: 14.<a name=307:5></a> "The worshippers once purged have no more conscience of sin[s]," Hebrews 10: 2.<a name=307:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 7 sets forth the state of the Christian with regard to purity, even as verses 2 and 3 do with regard to communion with God.<a name=307:7></a> Set in the light by the cleansing blood of Christ, and abiding there we are in communion with the saints; but communion has been first formed with the Father and the Son by the life we received in the Son.<a name=307:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 8.<a name=307:9></a> "If we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves.<a name=307:10></a>" The light requires that we should confess what we are in our nature.<a name=307:11></a> To say that we have no sin is not only ignoring a truth but also deceiving ourselves.<a name=307:12></a> In such a case the truth is not in us, for if Christ who is the truth dwells in us, we must know that we carry about a sinful nature.<a name=307:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verses 9, 10.<a name=307:14></a> The light also requires that we should confess the truth as to our actions.<a name=307:15></a> If we deny that we have sinned, which is equivalent to denying that sin is in the world, we are not converted, and in that case the word is not in us.<a name=307:16></a> "He is faithful and just.<a name=307:17></a>" He cannot fail to answer to that attitude of grace which He has taken towards us.<a name=307:18></a>

		CHAPTER 2
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verses 1, 2 are the third general truth.<a name=308:1></a> In these two verses John sets forth the means whereby we can remain in communion with Him who is light.<a name=308:2></a> He consequently presents the advocacy of Jesus.<a name=308:3></a> Although in our present state we are not altogether beyond sin, for it is still in our nature and, alas!<a name=308:4></a> shews itself too often in our conduct, yet grace provides the means for maintaining us in communion with God or for restoring us when it is disturbed.<a name=308:5></a> It reconciles our weakness with the perfect position in which we are set to enjoy fellowship with God.<a name=308:6></a> Jesus Christ the righteous intercedes for us.<a name=308:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 1.<a name=308:8></a> "If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father.<a name=308:9></a>" The intercession of Christ is looked at more particularly in this connection, as the result of that grace which lifts us up when we have fallen, although that intercession also serves to keep us from falling.<a name=308:10></a> Has sin shewn itself in our walk?<a name=308:11></a> Far from undergoing the misfortune of remaining under the effect of our sin, we experience through the intercession of Jesus that gracious help, which sets us again before God, perhaps broken-hearted, still before God to whom we confess our sin.<a name=308:12></a> Our confession of sin is made to God, not to Jesus in order that He may intercede.<a name=308:13></a> His intercession in our behalf always goes on; it precedes us in our return to God.<a name=308:14></a> Therefore John does not say, If any man repent, we have an advocate; but he says, "If any man sin," for repentance in us in itself the result of the intercession of Jesus.<a name=308:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The forgiveness of God restores our soul to the enjoyment of His communion.<a name=308:16></a> This effect of the grace of God to us answers to the sprinkling of water upon defiled persons under the law.<a name=308:17></a> We have been sprinkled by blood once, and it is on that account that the sprinkling of water can avail to cleanse us.<a name=308:18></a> "An advocate" is a defender, one who takes up our cause, and exercises for us the office of protector.<a name=308:19></a> The care of the Roman patricians for their clients would give an idea of this office.<a name=308:20></a> By granting us a defender God has shewn that He cannot pass over sin with indifference.<a name=308:21></a> His fellowship and sin cannot go together.<a name=308:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"With the Father.<a name=308:23></a>" John does not say with God, because he is treating of our communion, and not of the mediation which maintains us in the presence of God.<a name=308:24></a> This latter subject belongs more especially to the Epistle to the Hebrews.<a name=308:25></a> "Jesus Christ the righteous.<a name=308:26></a>" The basis of our standing before God is not altered by our fall.<a name=308:27></a> Righteousness abides before God, the righteous One is there for us.<a name=308:28></a> But there is more.<a name=308:29></a>

		John gives us in this Epistle an expos of great principles which he lays down absolutely, leaving aside all details of application.<a name=309:9></a> Doubtless experience brings in various modifications; still they in no wise affect the original force of these principles.<a name=309:10></a> For instance, I say, Our meeting room is open to every one, anybody may enter it.<a name=309:11></a> But here is a man who cannot enter because he is lame.<a name=309:12></a> Will the exception to be made in his case alter what I have said?<a name=309:13></a> No.<a name=309:14></a> So is it also with divine things.<a name=309:15></a> If we only possessed the great principles of the truth of God in the measure of their application to man, we should never really possess them at all.<a name=309:16></a> It is indispensable to discern this absolute way of setting forth the truth of God in order to understand the Epistle of John.<a name=309:17></a> "Not for ours only.<a name=309:18></a>" Ours are the sins of us, Jews.<a name=309:19></a> Such I believe to be the sense of this word "ours," according to a passage in his third Epistle (verse 8), in which John identifies himself with the Jews.<a name=309:20></a>

		"CHILDREN" (<i>teknia</i>) is an endearing term used by John to the saints; spoken also by our Lord when He said, "Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God.<a name=312:18></a>" Mark 10: 24.<a name=312:19></a> This expression runs through the whole Epistle.<a name=312:20></a> But in verses 13 and 18, where the moral classes are referred to, the words "little children" are represented by the word <i>paidia</i> which occurs only in these two verses.<a name=312:21></a> John speaks twice to each of the three classes.<a name=312:22></a>

For instance, a man makes a great display of knowledge, but he lacks the love of the brethren. By this we know that he is in darkness, and we avoid him.

This is the evil the saints had to contend with. There might be erroneous elements mixed with the faith of some persons, and whilst being a cause for vigilance and care on the part of those who are with them, this need not hinder their walking together. But if anyone sins against "the doctrine of Christ," that is to say, against the doctrine which concerns Christ Himself, and which is the basis of the faith, he is not to be received.

In another place speaking of the heavenly Jerusalem, it says, "The glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light [lamp] thereof." It follows from this that it is outside the inaccessible light that the God of glory reveals Himself to man, and that this revelation is made through Jesus.

		Verse 9.<a name=317:14></a> "Whosoever is born of God doth not practise sin.<a name=317:15></a>" In interpreting this passage some make the words "commit sin," mean "live in sin," but this weakens its bearing.<a name=317:16></a> These words have reference to something absolute, to the nature of Christ within us.<a name=317:17></a> So John does not say, That which, but "whosoever is born of God," thereby meaning a being and not a thing, and that being does not practise sin.<a name=317:18></a> Doubtless not to practise sin is the characteristic of the child of God.<a name=317:19></a> The Christian does not live in sin, and this because he has a holy nature which spiritually constitutes the individual.<a name=317:20></a>

		Among the number of blessings which have fallen to our lot, there are several of a kind different from the one we have just spoken of; for instance, those which flow from the counsels of God; the portion of the church as united to Christ, the inheritance promised to the saints, blessings which are unfolded in Paul's epistles.<a name=322:1></a> But in the Epistle of John we get an order of privileges more connected with the Person of God Himself -- with His nature, of which by grace we are partakers.<a name=322:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Verses 9-12.<a name=322:3></a> God has manifested His love by sending His only-begotten Son through whom He has given us life, found a propitiation for us, and by whom He has revealed Himself in love.<a name=322:4></a> These verses set forth the Christian privileges brought by Jesus at His first coming.<a name=322:5></a> Here are some details.<a name=322:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verses 9, 10.<a name=322:7></a> The love of God which now moves in our souls was first shewn by acts outside us.<a name=322:8></a> It wrought in our behalf when as yet there was nothing but sin in us.<a name=322:9></a> "In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only-begotten Son into the world that we might live through him.<a name=322:10></a> Herein is love, not that we loved God but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.<a name=322:11></a>" Thus our privilege of feeling our hearts filled with the love of God flows from the love God had for us when we were but sinners; and this love has become ours by the possession of an object outside ourselves.<a name=322:12></a> If with respect to this privilege, we had only the subjective side, that is, the love in us, it would be pure mysticism; but there is also the objective side, the love of God for us.<a name=322:13></a> Thus there is no room for that self-worship which is such a strong characteristic of religious sentimentalism.<a name=322:14></a>

Secondly, they judge their sins between themselves and God; then the impression is much deeper. (Psalm 130. *De profundis.)* God responds to this also.

		OUTLINE OF THE REVELATION
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us look a little at the different forms of evil in connection with the Revelation.<a name=360:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When we go beyond the seven churches, we find the government of the world, but we see the government put into the hands of the Lamb that was slain.<a name=360:2></a> The book, we know, is divided into three parts; chapter 1: 19.<a name=360:3></a> Firstly, "The things which thou hast seen," that is, the personal glory of Christ; not merely in His deity, nor His humanity, but in the character of judgment, as seen in chapter 1.<a name=360:4></a> Secondly, "The things which are" -- the seven churches -- His judgment of the seven churches as given in chapters 2 and 3.<a name=360:5></a> Thirdly, "The things which shall be hereafter" (or, after these).<a name=360:6></a> There we see God's judgment and government of the world.<a name=360:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 1 we find the divine attributes in One who is Man.<a name=360:8></a> There is a full description of the Lord Jesus, not as girded for priestly service, but "clothed with a garment down to his foot"; here it is priestly judgment.<a name=360:9></a> The "golden girdle" is divine righteousness.<a name=360:10></a> "His head and his hairs were white like wool," the Ancient of days; Daniel 7: 9.<a name=360:11></a> "His eyes a flame of fire" are divine unsparing scrutiny; "His feet like unto fine brass," earthly judgment; "His voice as the sound of many waters," His majesty; "His countenance as the sun," supreme light; "The first and the last," Jehovah; "He that liveth and was dead," the risen man.<a name=360:12></a> We see Him with certain divine attributes, and executing judgment as the Son of man.<a name=360:13></a> There is something similar in chapters 7 and 10 of Daniel.<a name=360:14></a> You get Him as Jehovah, and as One risen from the dead, as the risen Man walking among the candlesticks.<a name=360:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The seven churches (chapters 2, 3) then existing are looked at as those which Christ judges, though they present to us the whole history of the church until the coming of the Lord.<a name=360:16></a> They are thus given that there might be nothing to hinder their looking for the immediate coming of the Lord.<a name=360:17></a> It is the same in Matthew 25.<a name=360:18></a> The virgins who go to sleep are the same that wake; and the servants who receive the talents are the same the Lord reckons with at His coming, though ages and generations have passed away from the time of the church going to sleep, and the time of the going forth of the cry, "Behold, the Bridegroom cometh.<a name=360:19></a>" When the Spirit of God speaks of the Bridegroom tarrying, He speaks of the present state of things existing unto the end.<a name=360:20></a> We see seven subsisting churches, and there is no form of evil can come in that is not provided for.<a name=360:21></a> In Jerusalem was found the blood of all the prophets; in Babylon (chapter 17) the blood of all the saints.<a name=360:22></a> We at the close have all the responsibility.<a name=360:23></a> The vision and the blessing was from Him who is, and who was, and who is to come.<a name=360:24></a> "Who is" is the immutable being of God.<a name=360:25></a> Thus time is brought in in connection with Him who is eternal -- the coming One -- who is, was, and is coming.<a name=360:26></a>

		In chapter 4 we see a throne set in heaven, and the four living creatures surrounding it.<a name=361:1></a> The throne of Daniel 7 is a partial development; but it is not simply the throne in that character here.<a name=361:2></a> We have cherubim as well as seraphim.<a name=361:3></a> What is the difference?<a name=361:4></a> The cherubim are connected with present judgment on the earth; they are the seat of God's judicial power on earth.<a name=361:5></a> The seraphim covered their faces, crying, "Holy, holy, holy.<a name=361:6></a>" They are connected with God revealed, so as to bring man as man into His presence.<a name=361:7></a> In Isaiah 6 we find the seraphim.<a name=361:8></a> Here we see government in respect to the holiness of God's nature, not so much His revealed ways.<a name=361:9></a> God comes out according to His nature.<a name=361:10></a> Anything not according to that nature I cannot have.<a name=361:11></a> We find the incompatibility of God's nature with sin -- the contrariety of an unholy nature with a holy Being.<a name=361:12></a> The living creatures here are cherubim, the attributes of God and the heads of creation -- cattle, beasts of the field, birds, and man.<a name=361:13></a> The lion was the symbol of strength; the calf, firmness; man, intelligence; the eagle, swiftness of judgment.<a name=361:14></a> The seraphim in Isaiah 6 have nothing to do with grace, only with judgment.<a name=361:15></a> The coal of fire is grace, but burning grace.<a name=361:16></a> Cherubim are the government of God on earth; seraphim cry, "Holy, holy, holy.<a name=361:17></a>" The living creatures here illustrate the cherubic character: Holy, holy, holy, the seraphic character; the seven Spirits of God the attributive character.<a name=361:18></a> The seven lamps are the seven Spirits; they are in connection with God's government of the earth, and similar to Isaiah 11, "the spirit of wisdom," etc.<a name=361:19></a> The rainbow (verse 3) is God's covenant with creation.<a name=361:20></a> You find judgment, but not yet the Lord till the next chapter.<a name=361:21></a> The living creatures in Ezekiel 1 are the attributes of God, the pillars of the throne.<a name=361:22></a> "The Lord reigneth .<a name=361:23></a>.<a name=361:24></a>.<a name=361:25></a> he sitteth between the cherubims," Psa 99: 1.<a name=361:26></a> Man made gods of the attributes to worship.<a name=361:27></a>

		In chapter 5 the angels are seen as a distinct set outside.<a name=362:1></a> In chapter 4 are no angels at all -- the living creatures may be angels; in chapter 5 they are the heavenly saints.<a name=362:2></a> We perhaps get here the transfer of power from angels to men, according to Hebrews 2.<a name=362:3></a> The coming age is not to be under angels, but under man.<a name=362:4></a> The Lamb's taking the book is the beginning in a certain way of the coming age.<a name=362:5></a> All through the old dispensation God was dealing with man through <i>angels</i> -- "the law was given by the disposition of angels"; now they are displaced by <i>man</i>, their power transferred to the heavenly saints.<a name=362:6></a> The four living creatures are only used as symbols, just as the beast of chapter 17 has seven heads and ten horns; if taken literally, where would you put the ten horns on seven heads?<a name=362:7></a> They have tried to put them in pictures, and they have made a mess of it.<a name=362:8></a>

		God has been pleased to use certain agents, according to these attributes, of which the beasts are the symbols.<a name=362:14></a> He has used angels, He will use saints.<a name=362:15></a> Earthly saints will not reign over the earth, they are reigned over -- a royal nation in a certain sense.<a name=362:16></a> The beasts have more the governmental character, the elders are worshippers.<a name=362:17></a> Both represent the church in chapter 5; they may perhaps include the Old Testament saints too.<a name=362:18></a> The elders are characterised by their intelligence in the mind of God.<a name=362:19></a> In chapter 5: 10, the words us and <i>we</i> should be <i>them</i> and <i>they</i> -- it refers to the remnant.<a name=362:20></a> Their song mentions the two classes -- themselves the heavenly saints, and the remnant.<a name=362:21></a> "Redeemed or bought," "made them.<a name=362:22></a>" He is worthy, for He has purchased us.<a name=362:23></a> It is not here so much His character as the Redeemer making atonement that is seen, but rather what we find in Philippians 2 -- the humbled Man set upon the throne -- the effect of His death for <i>Him</i>, and not for us.<a name=362:24></a> Through death He got into this place.<a name=362:25></a> It is His title to take the government of the earth.<a name=362:26></a>

		Verse 6.<a name=362:27></a> The seven horns and the seven eyes represent the perfection of power and the perfection of intelligence.<a name=362:28></a> The "eyes" are the exercise of divine intelligence in the government of the earth.<a name=362:29></a> (See 2 Chronicles 16: 9; Zechariah 4: 10.<a name=362:30></a>) In the lion (verse 5), we have the symbol of power, in the lamb (verse 6) of redemption, in the seven spirits we get the Holy Ghost as governing.<a name=362:31></a> They are sent out into all the earth, the divine perfection of government in the earth.<a name=362:32></a> The eyes in chapter 4 are all-seeing; in chapter 5 perfection in government; in chapter 4: 8 internal spiritual perception; in chapter 5 all is looked at as in order, both in the heavens and the earth, the effect of the Lamb's taking the book.<a name=362:33></a> There is no reign in chapter 4.<a name=362:34></a>

		Chapter 11: 2.<a name=366:10></a> The holy city is trodden under foot of the Gentiles forty-two months.<a name=366:11></a> This is the second half of the last of the seventy weeks of Daniel.<a name=366:12></a> We only find the last half of the week spoken of in Revelation.<a name=366:13></a> The whole week is spoken of in Daniel 9: 24-27.<a name=366:14></a> First, you have seven weeks -- these were historical; then sixty-two weeks are added, bringing us "unto Messiah the Prince.<a name=366:15></a>" "After these things [it does not say how long] Messiah is cut off.<a name=366:16></a>" The first half of the remaining week we find is the ministry of Christ which lasted three years and a half.<a name=366:17></a> Then the Messiah is cut off.<a name=366:18></a> So now to faith there is only the last half of the week to come.<a name=366:19></a> But the apostate nation, not owning the period of Christ's ministry, "confirms the covenant" with Antichrist for the whole week.<a name=366:20></a> They go on flourishing till the middle of the week.<a name=366:21></a> Then Antichrist breaks his covenant with them, and their judgment follows, and Jerusalem is trodden down of the Gentiles for "forty and two months.<a name=366:22></a>" They refused Him who came in His Father's name, and will receive him who comes in his own name.<a name=366:23></a> In Daniel 7: 25 it is the times and laws, and not the saints, that are given into his hand.<a name=366:24></a> In the first book of Psalms we see the experience of the remnant during the first half-week, and that is why we find more of the experience of the Lord Jesus here than in all the other Psalms.<a name=366:25></a> In the half-week of the Lord's ministry the remnant received Him, the nation did not.<a name=366:26></a> When under Antichrist the nation again go through the first half-week, it will be the converse, the nation receive him and the remnant do not.<a name=366:27></a> In the Gospels by Matthew and Mark we have only the last tribulation, whilst in Luke is also seen the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus.<a name=366:28></a> Luke says nothing of the abomination of desolation set up.<a name=366:29></a> We find from Revelation 11: 1-3 that true worship and true testimony are maintained during the whole of this time of one thousand two hundred and sixty days.<a name=366:30></a> Time is never counted except in connection with the Jews.<a name=366:31></a> The church belongs to heaven, and time is not reckoned in connection with it.<a name=366:32></a> There is no date mentioned in Revelation till you come to the last half-week (verse 9, probably literal days).<a name=366:33></a> When the church is caught up, there will be apostasy.<a name=366:34></a> We see in 2 Thessalonians 2 that those who received not the love of the truth that they might be saved are given up to believe a lie.<a name=366:35></a> So to Christendom it is the same thing whether Christ comes, or does not come; if the truth is rejected, they die in their sins.<a name=366:36></a> Revelation 11 takes us on to the last scene of judgment -- that of the dead, which takes place after the millennium: this finishes the book.<a name=366:37></a> Thus the beast, Babylon, and then the appendix (chapters 11: 19, and chapters 12, 13 and 14) go together.<a name=366:38></a>
