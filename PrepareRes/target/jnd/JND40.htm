		The evil, even of the saint's nature, had yet to be manifested in relation to His position in glory, when owned even, which passed by all the solemn and affecting truths just that moment presented, and which ought to have changed, could mere truths and facts do it, the whole position of the human heart.<a name=3:20></a> It was really the discovery of its irreparable badness, even when there was an acknowledgment of the glory, the humiliation, and the deep grace in it; and the ruin of man, of themselves, it disclosed, was entirely unfelt and unentered into -- took no effect whatever on their heart; they were totally dark and blind to it.<a name=3:21></a> Man's heart is so.<a name=3:22></a> It must be partakers of them by the Holy Spirit to know them.<a name=3:23></a> It is a true portion of the saints that, if we keep the Lord's words, we may ask what we will, and it shall be done unto us.<a name=3:24></a> But here was the seeking their own exaltation in His glory, and that in the very face of the testimony of His humiliation.<a name=3:25></a> There was the appearance of faith, for it assumed His glory, and that He would be

		exalted, though He was just speaking of His humiliation.<a name=4:1></a> They say that whatever they ask He should do it.<a name=4:2></a> This is just the form of faith and promise; yet it was the pure spirit of self-exaltation, re-proved, and the very contrary to the Spirit of Christ.<a name=4:3></a> It did not enter into His humiliation, nor was really identified with Him, and sought its own glory, assuming, as we have said, withal the character of faith in His glory, flattering the Lord (had He been susceptible of anything of the kind) at the moment of His trial -- a work really of Satan from beginning to end; and the form which the spirit of the world or self-exaltation takes in the saint under a spiritual giver -- a suitable occasion for the flesh to make such a request, but the greatest, real insensibility.<a name=4:4></a> The Lord, however, in the patience of grace, His own soul now dwelling on what He was going to pass through, still presses this: "Ye know not what ye ask.<a name=4:5></a>" And the deep self-humiliation, or rather the taking and keeping as His, the low place in which for our sakes, in the manifestation of the divine glory, He had set Himself.<a name=4:6></a>

		perfectness of this reply, not in mere statement of principles, but in the blessed silent (yet far more eloquent) expression of it in His own conduct.<a name=5:1></a> I know not a more beautiful expression of our Lord's perfectness in humiliation, and abstract perfection in the place He had taken in which alone God could be perfectly glorified.<a name=5:2></a> How different from "Ye shall be as gods.<a name=5:3></a>" As the first Adam exalted Himself to be as God, so the Second humbled Himself entirely (even to the death of the Cross) that God, in all His character, supremacy, and glory, might be completely, and finally, and altogether glorified.<a name=5:4></a> How fully He emptied Himself, and, just because Himself, never ceased to exist!<a name=5:5></a> Therefore the emptying was always absolutely perfect.<a name=5:6></a>

		Then how blessed, as to the suffering, "The cup that I drink, shall ye drink!<a name=5:7></a>" Oh, what a privilege to follow Jesus, let it be ever so feebly!<a name=5:8></a> And all through grace, and so only blessed too.<a name=5:9></a> Yet in that in which He exhibited His own divine perfectness, not merely to follow but to be with Him in it -- for we are not speaking of atonement here, but of suffering in it, not the cause or effect of the cup, but of His Spirit in drinking it, in which we have the privilege, according to our measure, of the sufferings of Christ abounding in us.<a name=5:10></a> Glorious privilege!<a name=5:11></a> And filling up that which is behind of the sufferings of Christ, for His body's sake, the Church, and having all, in the certainty of His love, to His glory, and the Father's in it, knowing it is of grace in us, in Him of His will.<a name=5:12></a> Yet, in the perfect subjection of that will, suffering in the flesh.<a name=5:13></a> "For he that hath suffered in the flesh, hath ceased from sin," whereas the exercise of the will of the flesh is always sin; the subjection of it in suffering for God always righteousness, and, in Christ, being by His will intrinsic righteousness, in us conferred grace; compare <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#40">Psalm  40</a>.<a name=5:14></a> Through the truth, looking at this in communion as an object, we are sanctified.<a name=5:15></a>

		In these thoughts of the flesh in the two brethren, we have first their own will which Christ did not take, and then their assertion of their own power to go through all He had to accomplish or pass through.<a name=5:16></a> This is drawn out by the expression of the Lord in the now consciousness of His approaching sorrow, for He was rejected: "Are ye able to drink the cup," etc.<a name=5:17></a>, "and be baptised with the baptism" of death in all its weight of suffering, to rise again?<a name=5:18></a> They, equalling themselves with Him, say: "We are able.<a name=5:19></a>" The Lord, in His wondrous grace, equals them with Him by grace.<a name=5:20></a> He does not say:

		"Ye are indeed able," but "Ye shall indeed drink.<a name=6:1></a>" As we have said, "Ye shall indeed suffer with me"; the reward of glory I leave to the appointment of the Father -- it is not mine to give, but to whom it is prepared.<a name=6:2></a> The indignation of the ten was, if not so deliberate, not much less the flesh than the wish of the two.<a name=6:3></a> It was founded on the same feeling of being first or last.<a name=6:4></a> The Lord therefore calls them all, and reminds them this was a Gentile practice, the spirit of the world.<a name=6:5></a> It had, in a sense, been forbidden, even among earthly Israel.<a name=6:6></a> But here all was contrary, "Whosoever would be great" "among them should be" their "servant.<a name=6:7></a>" They were a people quite separate, separated by the gulf of death and the Cross from the world; to be great there was out of question, but among them it was to be all different.<a name=6:8></a> "He who would be great should be their servant.<a name=6:9></a>" And in very deed so it is; the lowest is the first in Christianity.<a name=6:10></a> Whoever wished to be first should be servant of all.<a name=6:11></a> It fulfils itself in the dispensations of God; for this indeed was the very errand of the Son, to come and act on His own principles -- of love -- in the midst of the world, and not to mix Himself with it, and fall in with its ways.<a name=6:12></a> He came in the power, and new principle of love, "to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.<a name=6:13></a>" He it was they were to follow.<a name=6:14></a> Nothing could be simpler, for they were quite a separate people.<a name=6:15></a> The darkest sense of need was more to the purpose, in calling out the true and unfailing power of Christ, never failing and never wearied by man's wretchedness, in the effecting the works of divine mercy.<a name=6:16></a> And if the Lord came that they which saw might be made blind, He came that they which saw not might see.<a name=6:17></a> This poor blind man, in the sense of need, cries for mercy, owning Jesus honestly as the Son of David, less apparent faith than those who spoke of His glory that they might have it for themselves -- grace, the grace of the Lord had prepared this man's soul for this occasion, and now the occasion occurred, for God works where we know not.<a name=6:18></a> But he was seeking the supply of his wants in the acknowledgment of Jesus' glory.<a name=6:19></a> The world rebuked him, but he was in earnest, he wanted the blessing, and he sought it.<a name=6:20></a> This man knew what he asked for -- the sense of our wants is true knowledge (in asking).<a name=6:21></a> On the cry: "Have mercy," Jesus at once stood, and proposed, to this cry of need, the very thing which He had reproved and set aside in the two brethren: "What wilt thou that I should do unto you?<a name=6:22></a>" So different are the

		Jesus was now entering by this ancient port of Israel -- the sign of God's favour, and the nation's refusal of judgment in its rebuilding -- the door of hope to rebellious and apostate Israel.<a name=7:6></a> Here He is first acknowledged King, the Son of David, by the blind receiving, in the sense of their misery, sight from Him.<a name=7:7></a> The nation's dealing in respect of this title remains to be seen.<a name=7:8></a> This was the blind seeing, Israel's true restoration and hope; for who was blind as His servant, seeing many things and observing not?<a name=7:9></a> Here the Remnant followed Him -- this poor blind man, the first herald of the King of mercy, the Son of David, Jesus.<a name=7:10></a>

		-- 51.<a name=7:31></a> Compare verse 35.<a name=7:32></a> This is ever the Lord's word to faith.<a name=7:33></a> I suppose faith ever runs parallel with the Lord's will, for faith has its operation in the power of that kingdom which is the fulfilment of the Lord's will; when the request flows from our own will therefore, it cannot be the prayer of faith, and is a mere subjection of God and His counsels to our fallen wills.<a name=7:34></a> Accordingly, "We know that whatsoever we ask

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=8>[Page 8]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		according to His will, He heareth us.<a name=8:1></a>" And I am persuaded this knowledge of the divine will and faith run proportionally.<a name=8:2></a> It is (not knowledge properly but) in fact the knowledge of faith, and where there is the enquiry of faith, short of the apprehension of the will of God, we pray in truth in implicit subjection to His will, looking for that increase of the Spirit which shall enlighten us in power of conversation.<a name=8:3></a> Our personal necessities, however, may, even in this subjection to the divine will, be brought before God; when there is genuine trust in Him, we propose ourselves for mercy.<a name=8:4></a> The "What wilt thou" is God's part; the "We will" comes quite wrong from us, and marks want of trust or acknowledgment of the need first of mercy, and we generally, in such case, "know not what" we ask.<a name=8:5></a> And hereto the word of man, besides the willingness, applies "Lord, if Thou wilt, Thou canst," and the Lord said: "I will, be thou.<a name=8:6></a>" The point we should practically enquire into is, Is our will concerned, or is there simple-hearted reliance upon the wisdom, and acknowledgment of the righteousness of the divine counsels and will?<a name=8:7></a> If it be our will, we may judge it (and this includes our judgment) to be at variance with the divine counsels, and injurious to our own peace, though it may, as the two disciples had, have a reference generally to, and seeking strong acknowledgment of the object of faith.<a name=8:8></a> However, there is a distinction between doing this in ignorance and misled perhaps by others, as here, and wilfully as in the Jews in the wilderness.<a name=8:9></a> In the latter case, I conceive the object will be found ever present and personal, and to be real distrust, and love of present gratification.<a name=8:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the exact coincidence of the language of the two disciples, and the Lord's subsequent promise, <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:13">John  14:13</a>, and chapter 15: 7, connected too with our Lord's words in verse 3 leads us to the true source of this deeply interesting question.<a name=8:11></a> But the just weighing of the several passages in the Gospel of John, fully opens this comprehensive, and all-important truth to our souls.<a name=8:12></a>

		The whole scene, as regarded presenting Himself as the Object of their faith, was really now closed, and the Lord was now to present Himself in the claim of His royal character, and judicial Lordship in the Temple, and to have them all before Him, and to judge them in this capacity.<a name=9:1></a> His presenting Himself as a gracious witness was now closed, and He acts on the claim, and makes it good in the need of this manifestation, as before His willing subjection, though He could command all creation to meet the need, that subjection occasioned, of the didrachma.<a name=9:2></a> He sends two of His disciples, and takes the ass, "Whereon never man sat," for this royal and entitled Claimant of the throne of Israel to sit upon, "And if any say to you, Why do ye this?<a name=9:3></a>" They were to say simply: "The Lord hath need of it.<a name=9:4></a>" "And straightway he would send it there.<a name=9:5></a>" Thus knowing and ordering the distant heart, and manifesting how David's Lord had good claim to be David's Son, indeed to be received as such in the title of His own Person and glory, He who did these things by this divine power and ordering was claiming surely in grace, and in no needless untruth, the place of David's Son.<a name=9:6></a> All was already subject to Him, to whatever He might subject Himself.<a name=9:7></a> This was over several hearts, whoever they were, so that it was not merely knowledge of the owner, but control of their hearts; "and some of those who stood there.<a name=9:8></a>"

		The same divine power was controlling the hearts of the disciples, and the multitude, to give this testimony to the royalty of Jesus, and accomplish the words of the Prophet.<a name=9:9></a> "They put their garments upon it, and he sat on it.<a name=9:10></a>" A new position of the lowly Jesus -- yet lovely even in this.<a name=9:11></a> "And many strewed their garments on the way.<a name=9:12></a>" "And they that preceded," inspired to sing the same testimony of Israel, cried saying, as in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#118">Psalm  118</a>as Israel shall say in that day: "Hosanna!<a name=9:13></a> Blessed be he that cometh in the Name of the Lord.<a name=9:14></a> Blessed be the coming kingdom of our father David.<a name=9:15></a>" This was really the full language of waiting for the kingdom, and acknowledging the Person of Messiah, and looking up to the heavens as the source of it, saying: "Save now in the highest.<a name=9:16></a>" Thus was the full testimony given to the Son of David, the Lord Jesus,

		Whatever the explanation of the end of this chapter from verse 9, it is evident, I think, that it is an added morsel.<a name=42:7></a> I have often noticed that it is the John and Luke aspect of the history which is added in a summary; but the <i>anastas de proi</i> (when He had risen very early) comes in unconnected with any governing noun, rather confirming, I think, its genuineness, but showing it is not a continuous history but added, but its being "Jesus" assumed.<a name=42:8></a> It assumes it to be Jesus, mentioned in verse 6, but has not the air of continuity.<a name=42:9></a> But while following the Matthew part at first, it takes up the other aspects as what the writer had at heart.<a name=42:10></a> Nor is it a connected story, for verse 9 does not directly connect with verse 2; "they" in verse 2 is general.<a name=42:11></a> Mary of Magdala came first alone; verse 3 implies there were others engaged in the matter.<a name=42:12></a> They bought the spices Saturday, after 6 o'clock, and the two last went at sunrise next morning.<a name=42:13></a> It merely gives the general character of the history; they find the angel and flee alarmed, having received the message as to Galilee.<a name=42:14></a> Matthew gives the same history with more detail as to the angel; the women are thrown into a lump in verse 5; from <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#23:55">Luke  23:55</a>, and chapter 24: 1, 10, we learn there were several.<a name=42:15></a> Then we get the Mary of Magdala account, and the two to Emmaus.<a name=42:16></a> Thus verses 9 to 20 is evidently a calm retrospect on the whole scene, and its consequence; verse 19 was forty days after what precedes; and, verse 20, we have the consequence -- it professes to be after the apostles generally had gone out, knowing nothing of Paul, <i>quod nota</i>.<a name=42:17></a>

		REMARKS ON THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The way in which God and man in One Person are united and presented in the blessed Lord in this Epistle, strikes me more and more, so that it is impossible to separate and apply them distinctively; chapter 5: 20 giving the clue to it.<a name=52:1></a> Thus already in chapter 2: 5, in whom do we know we are?<a name=52:2></a> All previously is Christ as such, and His word is spoken of.<a name=52:3></a> But "in him" is always "in God" here, nor do I believe that it occurs to the apostle to distinguish them here; in verse 6 it is clearly Jesus Christ, for we are to walk as He walked; and it may be taken to be Christ in verse 5.<a name=52:4></a> But being in Christ is not the subject or tone of the Epistle as distinguishing Him.<a name=52:5></a> Verses 24, 27 makes "Him" in the last impossible to distinguish.<a name=52:6></a> Of what follows I have spoken elsewhere.<a name=52:7></a> In verse 28 it is Christ, in verse 29 it is God.<a name=52:8></a> In chapter 3: 1, it is God, "children of God," but in the end of the verse Christ on earth is the same Being; verse 2, it is God again, but like Him, Christ, and we see Him as He is.<a name=52:9></a> So chapter 3: 3, 23, clearly God -- Jesus Christ is His Son -- but "He gave us commandment" is Jesus Christ Himself.<a name=52:10></a> But in verse 24, His commandments are God's, and he who keeps them dwells in Him, and He in him, and He has given us His Spirit.<a name=52:11></a> In chapter 4: 2, He is the Spirit of God.<a name=52:12></a> In verse 12, it is clearly so, God dwells in us, and this is connected with His nature.<a name=52:13></a> Still it is God Himself, and we dwell in Him; and it is by the Spirit we know, first we dwell in Him, and then He in us.<a name=52:14></a> But the source of it is that God dwells in us.<a name=52:15></a> Verses 12 and 15 are positive revelations of the word; verse 13 our experimental realisation of it.<a name=52:16></a> In verse 16 also, God being Love, he that dwells in love dwells in God and God in him.<a name=52:17></a> Chapter 3: 24 is the outward fact, so that the Spirit could be distinguished from evil ones; compare <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:1">1 Corinthians  12:1</a>, and following; chapter 14: 24, 25.<a name=52:18></a> But in <a href="../bible/1John.htm#3">1 John  3</a>the unity of God and Jesus as one Object before the mind is clear.<a name=52:19></a> There dwelling in God comes first, and then He in us.<a name=52:20></a> But the testimony of the Spirit is here only to Him in us, to guard against false spirits which were at work.<a name=52:21></a> In chapter 4: 17, it is clearly Christ; but it is God and His love which had been spoken of before.<a name=52:22></a>

		chapter 2: 5, which stands by itself, we have chapter 3: 23, 24.<a name=53:1></a> Obedience, love to one another, and faith in His Son Jesus Christ.<a name=53:2></a> But this brings out the practical fact that we dwell in Him and God in us -- the dwelling in Him being the state of our souls, when this life is so in existence.<a name=53:3></a> Here, His dwelling in us is the strength of His power and presence, which so belongs to us -- this, known to us by His Spirit given to us, and, for the moment, the Spirit confines itself to this, guarding us against false spirits.<a name=53:4></a>

		After that, having shown the connection of our new nature with God Himself, in its nature, and therewith the proof of love outside us in the gift of Christ, and God's love to us contrasted with our love to Him, so as to bring us up to Him, in verse 12 we get the great doctrinal fact that God dwells in him who loves.<a name=53:5></a> It is not merely a nature, but God Himself dwells in us.<a name=53:6></a> We know it "because he hath given to us of his Spirit.<a name=53:7></a>" But this is experimental, and it is first the consciousness that we dwell in Him.<a name=53:8></a> This is connected with love here as with obedience also; chapter 3: 24.<a name=53:9></a> If He is in us, who is infinite, and we so small, experimental realisation is necessarily of dwelling in Him.<a name=53:10></a> But then we recognise the fact, doctrinally stated, that He dwells in us; and this is active in testimony of grace.<a name=53:11></a> Nor was it only those who had seen and known Christ sent by Love -- whoever confessed that Jesus was Son of God, God dwelt in Him.<a name=53:12></a> It was not special attainment, but the privilege of every Christian; it was so of them all.<a name=53:13></a> God dwells in him, and he in God.<a name=53:14></a>

		In verse 16, he returns to experience, the groundwork of faith in manifested love, knowledge of His nature thus -- Love -- so that he that dwelt in that, dwelt in Him and God in him.<a name=53:15></a> The doctrinal fact then is that God dwells in the believer, but then he dwells in God -- infinite in love and being.<a name=53:16></a> Then practically God dwells in him, that he should be a living witness, and active in that love.<a name=53:17></a> For God gives us to enjoy Himself, and have part in that other blessedness, His activity of love.<a name=53:18></a> As to connecting God and Christ as One, see also chapter 2: 5, 6 -- a striking instance.<a name=53:19></a> Being in Him, verse 5, is different from abides in Him (<i>menei en auto</i>).<a name=53:20></a> It is the fact; abiding is added here too when he speaks of the state, consciousness of it being expressed.<a name=53:21></a> Further, verses 7 and 8 speak of the nature of love in us; verse 9 takes up God Himself, its Source, and unfolds its actings in Him, and its enjoyment.<a name=53:22></a>

		In the end of chapter 2 and beginning of chapter 3, besides the wonderful bringing together God and Man in the Person of Christ, and our unitedness to Him too, we have the nature of our new life as born of Him -- the relationship, children of God, but unknown as He was, and then the result, like Him in the glory; the present practical effect being added.<a name=54:1></a>

		I am not quite content with "lawlessness" for <i>anomian</i>.<a name=54:2></a> It is an exact representation of the word, for "less" is privative as <i>a</i>, but in English "lawlessness" has acquired the sense of active violence and reprobacy.<a name=54:3></a> <i>Anomos</i> -- it is a man who acts without respect to any law whose authority he owns to bind him.<a name=54:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Note too in <a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:28">1 John  2:28</a>, 29, and chapter 3: 1, 2, the remarkable proof of the way God is seen in Christ, often noticed already, as one great key to this Epistle.<a name=54:5></a> In verse 28 He appears -- it is His coming -- this is clearly Christ, in whom too we abide.<a name=54:6></a> He is righteous -- so every one born of Him is righteous; here we are children of God -- but it is "He.<a name=54:7></a>" Then chapter 3: 1, the world did not know whom?<a name=54:8></a> God doubtless, whose sons we are (and here not the Father's love) but when did not the world thus know Him?<a name=54:9></a> When He was in the form we are -- in Christ the Son of God on earth.<a name=54:10></a> No wonder it does not know us.<a name=54:11></a> He who appears is the same Christ, for we are to be like Him.<a name=54:12></a> He was in the world, and the world knew Him not; compare <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#7:9">Daniel  7:9</a>, 13, 22.<a name=54:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 1, "That which is from the beginning" notes that the life, though in its source eternal, was looked at as in Man, a new and absolutely original thing.<a name=54:14></a> This is very important as to its nature.<a name=54:15></a> The life which is our life is an entirely new original thing, as regards Man, for it was "with the Father" from all eternity, but it began in itself in Jesus as shown down here.<a name=54:16></a> It is no modification of the old or first Adam.<a name=54:17></a>

		Chapter 2: 28, to chapter 4: 6, has a double character of test; chapters 2: 28, 3: 23, states, on the ground of abiding in Him, the character of life, and extent of privilege, and its effect, bringing in and reasoning out the tests of righteousness and love of the brethren.<a name=55:12></a> (Righteousness seems more connected with abiding in Him; loving, with the new nature.<a name=55:13></a>) The second character of test is God's abiding in us proved by the Spirit He has given us.<a name=55:14></a> This however has itself to be tested by true confession of Christ, and by hearing the apostles themselves, i.<a name=55:15></a>e.<a name=55:16></a>, now their Epistles.<a name=55:17></a>

		God to Himself, to wit, forgiveness of sins in Christ Jesus And here one main deceit of falsehood lies.<a name=122:1></a> God, by forgiveness, wins the soul to guilelessness and confession, and towards Him who alone can reach and satisfy the conscience, and try the reins and the heart so as to convert them to holiness, for He is the only end of holiness, and, through forgiveness, brought very near to us in Jesus Christ, God becomes the Object of the soul in a way a sinner can receive Him with his whole heart, and love Him with his whole heart because he is a sinner.<a name=122:2></a> In a word, in Christ Jesus, God is manifested to the sinner as the absorbing Object of his soul in the way of grace and holiness now favourable towards him.<a name=122:3></a> On this hinge of forgiveness in Christ turns the whole restoration of the soul to God, even the God of love, who is Love, and so only can be justly known, or could the sinner receive as such; see <a href="../bible/Psalms.htm#32">Psalms  32</a>and 139.<a name=122:4></a> But in any other forgiveness, other than in Christ's Name, the conscience is not searched to the bottom, the heart is not consequently restored to God, nor purged, nor purified, but the sinner left precisely where he was or worse, by the supposed healing of his conscience.<a name=122:5></a>

		The doctrine of the restoration of the soul to God by absolute personal forgiveness, the covenant of infinite grace applied to sin, and making God known to the sinner in Jesus Christ is indeed the great all-important truth.<a name=122:6></a> The sinner cannot know God otherwise, for there is a breach between him and God, and while sin remains, one and all, upon his conscience he cannot know love, nor have communion with Him; he needs reconciliation, and this is given so as to set up God in holy love again to his soul by grace when it comes from Himself.<a name=122:7></a> Therefore, "How much more shall the blood of Christ who," etc.<a name=122:8></a>, "purge your conscience .<a name=122:9></a>.<a name=122:10></a>.<a name=122:11></a> to serve," etc.<a name=122:12></a> But it is not in philosophical views of these things that their power rests, but in the plain truths of it.<a name=122:13></a> In conclusion, that which is here is the evidence of the Person of Jesus Christ, and this is the hinge on which the whole force of the passage rests, and the more its force, bearings and consequences be examined, the more will the truth of this appear, and its weight be found.<a name=122:14></a> This testified of it, and all ministrations of forgiveness are but of this, and when this is known as revealed, the other is possessed as declared in that.<a name=122:15></a> "Forgiveness of sins" was to "be preached in his name," so the commission runs, "beginning," etc.<a name=122:16></a> The seal of it was by discriminating ministration; and,

		There is another point of great interest which I had not before noticed in Luke.<a name=123:2></a> After His baptism and temptation taking His place as Man (second Adam) and victory over Satan, instead of failing like the first, Christ begins by presenting Himself as the Fulfiller or Fulfilment of promise in grace, but looks for rejection as Joseph's Son (grace went beyond Israel and brought out their enmity) and proves His power, so that the demons own Him to be that One promised to Israel, as in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#89">Psalm  89</a>, of the <i>chasadim</i> (mercies) of the Lord.<a name=123:3></a> "Thou spakest in vision of thy Holy One (<i>chasid</i>).<a name=123:4></a> I have laid help on Him that is mighty.<a name=123:5></a> I have exalted One chosen out of the people.<a name=123:6></a>" So all the evils Satan has inflicted on man disappear before His word, and hereon He is recognised in two other parts of His Jewish titles and name -- Son of God and the Christ, as in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>, and He preaches the Kingdom of God.<a name=123:7></a> But He must preach the word of God, not remain for mere earthly comfort of man, nor His own.<a name=123:8></a> In chapter 5, He convicts of sin by revealing Himself to the conscience as the Lord, but removes fear, and gathers round Himself.<a name=123:9></a> We have not the fulfilment of promise and the Holy One, but a divine Person, and One revealing Himself as such and bringing in new things in grace.<a name=123:10></a> He acts as Jehovah to the leper, yet comes nearer than man could by right -- He touched him; others were defiled thus.<a name=123:11></a> He came touching man in sin, but driving away the defilement.<a name=123:12></a> So He forgives sins, and proves His Jehovah title to do so, according to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#103">Psalm  103</a>.<a name=123:13></a>

		First, however, the Lord brings out the position of the nation and that of the disciples, not resting here in contrast, as in Matthew, on the subject matter of the faith as changing the dispensation and founding the Church, but on the contrast of their and the nation's state as to their faith in what was proper to themselves as actually presented unto them.<a name=160:15></a> It was not a question of the enmity of chief priests, but the current notion among the multitude to whom full evidence had been afforded.<a name=160:16></a> But among them were merely the speculations which wonder had created.<a name=160:17></a> But Peter, ever the spokesman of the disciples, expresses in the certainty, the instruction of faith -- the Christ of God -- He was the Anointed of God.<a name=160:18></a> This man therefore was born of God, as we know from John.<a name=160:19></a> But this glory of Judaism, and truth of God, this appropriate, divine, and Jewish dignity, this office to the nation they were now no longer to tell.<a name=160:20></a> Having been refused on the merits of His glory and truth, He was not to be presented for the excitement and satisfaction of their passions.<a name=160:21></a> They were to tell no man that He was the Christ.<a name=160:22></a> He had presented Himself as the Fulfilment of the Prophets to them, and now as Son of man, a larger more humble Name but with glory reaching much farther, He was to suffer.<a name=160:23></a> He was to be owned by no fascinating and locally honoured title, but to accomplish a much larger and more important work by means of this very rejection.<a name=160:24></a> This was the counsel now to be fulfilled.<a name=160:25></a> He was to suffer, and all that was respectable by age, office, and learning was to be arrayed against Him, death to be the consequence, and He to rise again.<a name=160:26></a> This was opening quite a new and another scene, but the entire rejection and suffering here was to be His portion, and this would be in principle true of them.<a name=160:27></a>

		There are three things in this chapter -- the fellowship in the glory, the kingdom in its heavenly and earthly part, together with the personal relationship of the Son to the Father; secondly, the perfect grace of Christ on earth, and that however faith may fail in us, He is ever in the power of grace for need; thirdly, the searching out of self all that hindered true association with the glory as regards relationship to Christ, and then service.<a name=178:2></a>

		It is interesting to see how the change of dispensation connects itself with the state of souls.<a name=180:17></a> John comes as prophet with the testimony of fulfilment of prophecy.<a name=180:18></a> But now Christ, having given His own witness of Himself in grace to Gentiles and in power over death itself, does not receive testimony from John but gives it to him, and John comes in, in personal faith, as others do.<a name=180:19></a> But further, to meet man's need in grace, and detect man's false pride and glory, to put down flesh, He comes in utter humiliation.<a name=180:20></a> John's testimony is left behind; divine goodness and power gives witness to itself (chapter 7: 22), but in such a state that flesh could not brook it, "Blessed be he whosoever shall not be offended in me.<a name=180:21></a>" This manifestation of God reaches conscience on one side, and on the other gives perfect confidence in love.<a name=180:22></a> Conscience made, by grace, children of Wisdom.<a name=180:23></a> They owned God was right in His judgment of fruitless trees, and where flesh saw a devil they saw the true testimony of God as to themselves.<a name=180:24></a> When perfect love came down to their low estate, it was just what they wanted.<a name=180:25></a> They justified God, in that Wisdom was justified of her children.<a name=180:26></a> So the poor woman; and the stupid Pharisee

		I find two great principles of prayer here, the latter specially relative to the Holy Spirit.<a name=202:3></a> First, that whose efficacy is described as lying in importunity.<a name=202:4></a> This is not spoken of the Father; in Him liberality is spoken of, and sure kindness, from the very relationship.<a name=202:5></a> Here it is "Because of his shamelessness" (<i>anaideian</i>).<a name=202:6></a> It may be a friend that seeks it, but it is rendered to the importunity.<a name=202:7></a> Here God acts supremely, and according to His own thoughts, in a supremacy which maintains righteousness while it brings forth glory according to His purpose, a glory in which His fulness shall be displayed, as His love indeed accomplished -- but as to which, if I may so speak, He expects to and must be glorified, in which faith must be exercised acting on the holy and amazing consciousness of His power, and bearing in its bosom the reproaches of the mighty, and the dealings of God with evil.<a name=202:8></a> We read of Christ Himself; He "Was heard because of his piety," and at that time "Being in an agony he prayed more earnestly.<a name=202:9></a>" I do not say this is the only case, but it is ever a meeting of the demands of the Lord in faith.<a name=202:10></a> It is connected with the hindrances evil puts in the way of God's blessing, and the holy and jealous God, righteously jealous of His own character, must deal with the evil in dealing with the supplication.<a name=202:11></a> "It became him for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.<a name=202:12></a>" Thus, if there be evil in the Church, and the introduction of the working of the wicked one and I pray for blessing, I cannot have the blessing but in bearing in spirit (for efficaciously Christ has done it, and therefore I can so pray) but bearing in spirit the evil so that, the Lord's character in grace being fully honoured, He can give the blessing and restore from the power of the evil.<a name=202:13></a> I do not believe there was a case the Lord wrought in which His Spirit did not undergo the sorrow of the evil, so as to draw forth the complacency of His Father in union with whom He put forth

		the power of the cure.<a name=203:1></a> In intercession the Church and the saint has share in this work of Christ.<a name=203:2></a> It is not atonement but (which is true also in atonement) a full moral honour done to God.<a name=203:3></a> Hence, too, "Labouring earnestly in prayer for you all.<a name=203:4></a>" In a word, the spirit and heart must go through the full results of the moral character of God as exercising supremacy in holiness on the case, that the blessing may flow forth on the soul.<a name=203:5></a> Hence it is there are cases unto death which cannot be prayed for, because they are such that, though not exercising the judgment, the Church is forced by the evil to take part, as it were, with God against the evil, unable to separate it from the evil doer as a failure and weakness, and thus is silenced.<a name=203:6></a> It is not its part to judge, and cannot intercede.<a name=203:7></a> There is some difference between the Church and the individual, because the Church is looked at as possessing and even administering the charity of God, whereas the individual acts in individual faith, and so bears the burden.<a name=203:8></a> Cases of sin in the whole body may arise, which are however analogous.<a name=203:9></a> The difference was like the sin of the whole congregation, and an individual when the congregation was at peace.<a name=203:10></a> This importunity first then, and primarily, secures the vindication of the holy supremacy of God; but dependence in respect of our weakness and nothingness, and His supremacy, are taught too -- subjection and humbleness.<a name=203:11></a> Besides, faith is exercised, and intimacy with God wrought in the soul thereby, intimacy connected with dependence.<a name=203:12></a> Often, as we have seen, it is connected with God's moral government of others, and Satan's claim thereby, whence the suffering in intercession noticed above; and see Daniel.<a name=203:13></a>

		SUMMARY OF LUKE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The structure of Luke, though not so systematic in form as Matthew, is yet quite peculiar.<a name=355:1></a> We have first the lovely picture of the Jewish Remnant, on to the ministry of John, and the baptism and anointing of the blessed Lord.<a name=355:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Note in Luke when He is baptised, all the people had been baptised.<a name=355:3></a> He joins them in this path of God to be with them.<a name=355:4></a> When He puts forth His own sheep, He goes before them.<a name=355:5></a> We have the distinct difference of associating Himself with the godly Remnant in their divine path however lowly a one, and His taking His sheep as the divine Shepherd, whose own they were, clean out of the fold, going before them.<a name=355:6></a> Then His genealogy is traced up to Adam (read: "Jesus Himself began to be about thirty years old [being as was supposed the Son of Joseph] son of Heli, etc.<a name=355:7></a>) so, as before, Son of God, and so owned.<a name=355:8></a> Chapter 3: 23 in Authorised Version is clearly wrong.<a name=355:9></a> It should be (being as was supposed Son of Joseph) <i>tou Eli</i> (of Heli).<a name=355:10></a> The list begins with Heli not with Joseph.<a name=355:11></a> "Which was" is not in the text.<a name=355:12></a> He now comes out Son of man.<a name=355:13></a> All this is very noteworthy, and, note, full of the Holy Ghost.<a name=355:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then as such He is tempted and overcomes, and returns to Galilee in the power of the Spirit.<a name=355:15></a> But while announcing Himself as the fulfilment of Isaiah's prophecy, in grace in the midst of Israel, the Spirit of Jehovah upon Him, yet He shows Jehovah's consideration of the Gentiles, so that they would have destroyed Him.<a name=355:16></a> He sets aside the demon's power, and heals Simon's wife's mother and, the Sabbath being ended, all manner of diseases, but leaves to preach everywhere.<a name=355:17></a> He calls His chief disciples, and Simon, through full conviction of sin, though attracting him by grace; touches a man full of leprosy, and, with a will the leper was not sure of, heals him -- grace that came to touch the defiled and banish the defilement.<a name=355:18></a> He withdraws and prays, and then, in presence of all, manifests the title to forgive, as a present thing, in the power of healing (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#103">Psalm  103</a>).<a name=355:19></a> Eats with publicans and sinners, come "not to call the righteous but sinners.<a name=355:20></a>" The Bridegroom was there -- they were not fasting days -- He would soon be taken away from the disciples, and then would be fasting days.<a name=355:21></a> Besides, the power of His new doctrine could not be put into the old forms of Judaism.<a name=355:22></a> But man loves the old things he has drunk of.<a name=355:23></a>

		Again, the hatred of the Jews is called forth.<a name=356:4></a> All this is the setting aside of Judaism, and the revelation of the Son of man for sinners, and Gentiles, and all oppressed of the devil.<a name=356:5></a> Again, He passes all night in prayer (for praying distinguishes Him in Luke) and chooses the twelve as a company belonging to Himself.<a name=356:6></a> There was the company of His disciples, and a great multitude.<a name=356:7></a> He does good to all, but distinguishes the disciples formally here.<a name=356:8></a> "Blessed are ye poor"; we get the moral instructions that belong to His own.<a name=356:9></a> Though still going with the Jews, and giving heed to them, He owns the Gentile, has "not found such faith, no, not in Israel," and raises the dead far away above all promises to Israel as such, or their thoughts in the promised Messiah, though intimations of it are found in the prophets.<a name=356:10></a> This awakens universal rumour, and John himself is put upon the ground of faith by what Jesus did in power and grace, being fully owned in his ministry, though the least in God's kingdom was greater than he.<a name=356:11></a> The repentant justified God -- a remarkable expression; the self-righteous despised the grace.<a name=356:12></a> "Wisdom" was "justified of all her children" both in confession of sin, in John's ministry, and confidence in the grace come in Christ's Person.<a name=356:13></a> The striking example of this in the account that follows is deeply touching.<a name=356:14></a> We have the Pharisee's heart in utter blindness, God's heart, and the convinced and confiding sinner's heart, which just meets exactly the revelation of God's as that did it, the answer of forgiveness, salvation and peace being added Thus the whole moral condition of things is fully brought out.<a name=356:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Note, I see three principles in chapters 5 and 6.<a name=356:16></a> First, change of mind instead receiving the righteousness, for here, I suppose, repentance is genuine.<a name=356:17></a> "I came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.<a name=356:18></a>" Next, power brought in which could not adapt itself to the old system.<a name=356:19></a> Spiritual power, the new wine, could not be put into old bottles.<a name=356:20></a> Thirdly, grace, mercy contrasted with forms and sacrifice.<a name=356:21></a> The Son of man is Lord of the Sabbath.<a name=356:22></a> In the sermon following, the difference between it and Matthew is, it is less specially dealing with Judaism, giving great general principles in themselves.<a name=356:23></a>

		After the lovely picture of the Remnant in chapters 1 and 2, we have salvation made manifest to all, the nation warned, and the Remnant recognised, sovereign grace in electing love, and complete judgment just ready, and the axe laid to the root of the trees; verses 6 -- 9.<a name=364:1></a> This is important as regards the character of Luke's gospel.<a name=364:2></a> It is to be remarked too, that Luke, when replying to the musings of the people, does not speak of Christ's work, only of the active glory of His Person.<a name=364:3></a> He baptises with the Holy Ghost, and with fire, power of life, and blessing, and judgment, and then the present judgment of Israel (though the same thing will take place with the professing church).<a name=364:4></a> Then in Luke we find immediately the rejection of the testimony by the existing powers in Israel, and Christ traced up not to Abraham and David, or the roots of promise, but to Adam; so that the dealing with Israel continues up to the genealogy.<a name=364:5></a> It is a Remnant, a testimony of warning to the nation of immediate judgment, but Christ there, the Baptiser with the Holy Ghost, and judging His floor.<a name=364:6></a> The first two chapters were the Remnant when He came -- this the testimony of His precursor, and coming judgment, and the testimony rejected.<a name=364:7></a> It is after this that we have the Lord owned as Son, the heaven opens, and the Spirit descends, and here manifested as the dependent Man, for it is not only as baptised, but as He was praying that this occurred.<a name=364:8></a> And then He is traced up to (Son) of Adam (Son) of God.<a name=364:9></a> "Of Eli" is connected with Jesus Himself, I believe ("being, as was supposed, Son of Joseph," being a parenthesis) and here traced up naturally not legally.<a name=364:10></a> Even in the expression: "Full of the Holy Spirit" we find the Man.<a name=364:11></a>

		It is quite evident how the mysterious character of Messiah is brought out in the beginning of Hebrews, with details therefrom afterwards.<a name=378:1></a> It connects at the end of its subject no doubt with the Jews, but only at its end as a complementary part bringing in the millennium.<a name=378:2></a> But it is not the Church, but headship over all things with, at best, joint heirs and glory.<a name=378:3></a> It is Messiah in His Person, but Messiah glorified.<a name=378:4></a> There is a habitable earth to come, but that has been put in subjection to man, and Man takes a heavenly seat and wider sphere.<a name=378:5></a> The Son's title, as by inheritance having a more excellent Name, and Creator, I do not enter on here; that is wonderfully brought out in chapter 1.<a name=378:6></a> But in chapter 2 it is Man.<a name=378:7></a> Man was made a little lower than the angels (these were a separate creation) but the head of all things in the scene he was set in, the scene where all God's ways are displayed, where the angels learn them, as we read.<a name=378:8></a> Nor can there, we may boldly say, be two crosses.<a name=378:9></a> Well!<a name=378:10></a> man fell, and went down to death, below any creature; for it was its ruin, whereas the lowest was good in its place, and set to be there.<a name=378:11></a> And the whole creation under heaven was brought down with him, came down together out of its links and order with God.<a name=378:12></a> And, besides, Satan acquired dominion over man, and the creation in general as belonging to him, in death by it.<a name=378:13></a> All came down in ruin as a creation, and death the sign of it, and Satan was set up.<a name=378:14></a>

		Now we see, so is the fact, Jesus made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, coming down to be able to die (though their Creator, and far above them).<a name=378:15></a> And as all things had been put under man in purpose, a purpose not even yet fulfilled, and man had brought down the whole creation into ruin, himself sinking into death, death was the point where the Redeemer as Man must meet the case to redeem, and, not exactly restore, but meet the ruin in its lowest and central point where the head of the first creation had got, and so bring about the purpose of Man's headship to God's glory, such as no mere creature indeed could have done.<a name=378:16></a> Hence I judge <i>huper pantos</i> (for everything) is "thing" not "man" here.<a name=378:17></a> He could not say <i>panton</i> (all things) in this sense, for it was not individual cases, if the creation was taken in; nor was it <i>tou pantos</i> (of everything) as a whole, but in the most abstract form "everything.<a name=378:18></a>" It could not have been restored as a

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But this brings in another point; there were persons to be saved, sons to be brought to glory -- such was in the purpose.<a name=379:4></a> And it became Him for whom are all things, and by whom are all things (ruined as they now are) in bringing sons to glory, guilty with, and heirs of him who was the centre of the ruin and guilty in it, in bringing such to glory that He who set Himself as the Head of salvation should, for the majesty of Him for whom and by whom all things are, pass through that which was involved in that majesty in respect of the mediate cause of the ruin, and the responsible cause.<a name=379:5></a> For, though He atoned (and that comes afterwards) He associated Himself with them as far as God's glory and their glorifying was concerned.<a name=379:6></a> Sinless, and above all the evil, He took all its consequences on Him in suffering even to death.<a name=379:7></a> It became God so to deal with Him, He having taken that place.<a name=379:8></a> He was brought to the place of glory He was to have as Son of man (with those brought to glory as sons too in grace), through the sufferings.<a name=379:9></a> The glory of God demanded that He might be there, bringing withal the many sons with Him.<a name=379:10></a> "Bringing" (<i>agagonta</i>) seems most naturally to ally itself with "the leader" (<i>archegon</i>) than to stand between "Him" (<i>auto</i>) and "make perfect" (<i>teletosai</i>).<a name=379:11></a> It scarcely affects the point I am upon.<a name=379:12></a> For Christ and those He sanctified were all of one, were one set, Man, and men brought (by grace) into the same glory with Him; all were "of one," one sort, not a stranger to them, delivering them as He, suppose, might angels by power if needed, or God any creature, but all one set, all men, and to be glorified together, though One sanctified and the others were sanctified by Him.<a name=379:13></a>; But they were all one set to be thus His "partakers" (<i>metochoi</i>), for here it goes into the way of their getting to be so, in a time yet to come.<a name=379:14></a> The "of one" (<i>ex henos</i>) is as abstract as possible.<a name=379:15></a> They were in the same nature and condition, when raised to their new place.<a name=379:16></a> It is not the state of the nation; for when He said: "My brethren," He was risen (and He never did before) and they were not, but they were all taken to be one with Him, owned as His brethren.<a name=379:17></a> Hence, as the children had flesh and blood, He took it.<a name=379:18></a> He

		Now we have had man in purpose over all the works of God's hands -- man fallen, and the creation connected with him sunk down, he having gone down to death.<a name=380:2></a> We have seen Jesus, "made a little lower than the angels," taking a man's place that He might die, now crowned with honour and glory.<a name=380:3></a> He came down and took this place that He might taste what was the <i>ultima ratio</i> of creation-ruin, and its centre's, i.<a name=380:4></a>e.<a name=380:5></a>, man's place as taking his place in it, but He was withal bringing many sons to glory.<a name=380:6></a> And God, for whom all things are, must bring the Captain of their salvation into His glory and perfect place through sufferings.<a name=380:7></a> This was in the necessity of God's glory, seeing He was bringing such to glory.<a name=380:8></a> Here it is God's majesty, not atonement.<a name=380:9></a> If Christ put Himself at the head of such, He must go through what became the glory of Him to whom in glory He was bringing them, and walk the path through which His taking up their cause led Him, as required by the glory of God.<a name=380:10></a> For He did not help them by an outstretched hand from on high, but of one with them.<a name=380:11></a> Not that He was subject to it Himself; it was "Takes hold of" (<i>epilambanetai</i>).<a name=380:12></a> He, the Sanctifier, above it all, becomes a Man to enter into it all, that He may be able to enter into it all, and pass through the deep suffering that became God's glory in it.<a name=380:13></a> It was no subjection to it, or He could not have done so; but going through sufferings as became God's glory, because He, in the accomplishment of this glorious purpose, He and the co-heirs were to be "of one.<a name=380:14></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I get to the effect of His work -- a second point.<a name=380:15></a> He takes the flesh and blood that through death He might destroy Satan's power, his power might be rendered void, deliver the individuals who, as of this creation, dreaded this central witness of ruin, and their ruin as belonging to it itself, the end of what they were.<a name=380:16></a> Next, He took it so as to know all the sorrows of those He became High Priest for withal, making propitiation for the sins of the people.<a name=380:17></a> (Here it reaches over to what is Jewish in its terms.<a name=380:18></a>) Having made this propitiation, having Himself suffered being tempted, He is able to succour those tempted.<a name=380:19></a> All this latter part refers to Jewish thoughts naturally, but does not in effect leave out Gentiles, save the expression,

		Next, as regards the twelve shepherds of chapter 89, I see not how more than twelve are necessarily made out before Christianity.<a name=388:12></a> He says: "The first of these was Mattathias, the father of Judas Maccabaeus .<a name=388:13></a>.<a name=388:14></a>.<a name=388:15></a> after him came in succession Judas Maccabaeus, Jonathan, Simon, John Hyrcanus, Aristobulus, Alexander Jannaeus, Alexandra his widow, Aristobulus, Hyrcanus, Antigonus and Herod.<a name=388:16></a>" Mattathias is doubtful, Alexandra a woman, would not be counted.<a name=388:17></a> It would be then connected with Jerusalem, say, Judas Maccabaeus, Jonathan, Simon, John Hyrcanus, Aristobulus, Alexander Jannaeus, Hyrcanus, Antigonus, Herod, Archelaus, and, if we go on to the latter part of Herod, Agrippa when he had Judaea added.<a name=388:18></a> We are already, he admits, in fully Christian times.<a name=388:19></a> They go up to Herod, under whom Christ was born.<a name=388:20></a>

		hopes of a Jewish deliverance at that time, and then runs off into prophecies which require no attention.<a name=389:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On verse 4 of this chapter, "I have been born the seventh in the first week," Dr.<a name=389:2></a> Laurence says: "In the mode of reckoning here adopted, it is evident that a day stands for a hundred years; so that consequently a week is made to express a period of seven hundred years.<a name=389:3></a>" And he adds: "The seventh week closed with the second century of the Christian era.<a name=389:4></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Note, Dr.<a name=389:5></a> Laurence gives, and pretends to give, no proof of a date earlier than Jude, but that Jude quotes it, which is the point in question; he takes this as sufficient and conclusive.<a name=389:6></a> Now, I do not admit that it is a quotation from Enoch, as far as we can judge from this translation.<a name=389:7></a> These are its words: chapter 2, "Behold he comes with ten thousands of his saints, to execute judgment upon them and destroy the wicked, and reprove all the carnal for everything which the sinful and ungodly have done, and committed against him.<a name=389:8></a>" This is rather foist in, I should say.<a name=389:9></a> These are the apostle Jude's words from the Authorised Version: "The Lord cometh with ten thousands of His saints" (holy myriads) "to execute judgment upon all; and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard (speeches) which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him.<a name=389:10></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, I should decidedly say that this is not a quotation.<a name=389:11></a> The two passages have the appearance of referring to the same prophecy, but the apostle Jude's is far more precise, has far more the character of giving the prophecy as it was.<a name=389:12></a> He has far more the stamp of a real and original passage of prophecy.<a name=389:13></a> But it cannot be admitted to be a quotation, the differences are far too great.<a name=389:14></a> It is not merely citing the sense, for it is far more exactly and elaborately worded.<a name=389:15></a> Lcke speaks of it seeming to be the work of a Jewish Christian.<a name=389:16></a> He says: "But how much soever the whole makes one disposed to consider the book as the production of a Jewish Christian, I nevertheless hesitate to pronounce any fixed opinion, before the original form of the book is better known, than has been hitherto possible.<a name=389:17></a>" Laurence says this means interpolation, but he speaks of the character of the author, not of interpolation.<a name=389:18></a>

		He ministers greatly to the worship of angels, speaks of Son of man, Son of woman (chapter 61) and of saints as mediators, intruding into things which he has not seen.<a name=390:3></a> Nothing properly Christian is mentioned, nor the law either.<a name=390:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He calls Messiah "the Elect One," as Clement of Rome, and makes Him exist concealed before creation, and Son of man.<a name=390:5></a> He would lead the Jews to hopes of deliverance about the time of Christianity.<a name=390:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The fall of the angels is largely gone into by their connection with women.<a name=390:7></a> Astronomy, as to sun, moon, and stars, as to which he is very proud, and of course very ignorant.<a name=390:8></a> He was, as Laurence observes, in a higher latitude than Jerusalem (his longest day is sixteen hours) and, I think, he speaks in one place of it as "the south.<a name=390:9></a>" This would lead to suppose he had little knowledge of Christianity, if about the time of its promulgation in Judaea.<a name=390:10></a> It is impossible to have a greater contrast than between Jude and this stupid book.<a name=390:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He was pretty well acquainted with the Old Testament, many passages being referred to.<a name=390:12></a> I judge he would lead to the hope of a Jewish deliverance, but was more concerned to show off the fruit of his imagination.<a name=390:13></a> His anxiety to display his notions of astronomy is ludicrous, save the pretention to divinely imparted knowledge.<a name=390:14></a>
