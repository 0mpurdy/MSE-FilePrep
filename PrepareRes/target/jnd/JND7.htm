		BRIEF SCRIPTURAL EVIDENCE ON THE DOCTRINE OF ETERNAL PUNISHMENT, FOR PLAIN PEOPLE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The doctrine of everlasting punishment having been much called in question, and the minds of the simple shaken, and the faith of some overthrown (though I have been occupied with the subject, more at large, for some time back, with the purpose of writing on it), I have thought it well to publish some brief pages meanwhile for plain people.<a name=1:1></a> And here to such I would suggest to distrust those who talk much about Greek <i>to those who do not understand it</i>.<a name=1:2></a> It is easy thus to impose on people.<a name=1:3></a> It is useful to know Greek, no doubt, in studying the New Testament, because it was written in Greek; and it is perfectly fair to refer to it with those who, knowing Greek, can judge of what is said; but it is very suspicious when much quoted to those who do not; for how can they judge about it?<a name=1:4></a> A man tells you "eternal" does not mean "eternal" in Greek.<a name=1:5></a> That sounds very conclusive; but how can you judge whether it does or not?<a name=1:6></a> Now in all those who talk much about Greek to plain people, I have generally found trickery; and that their Greek has not been worth much when put to the test by those who did understand it.<a name=1:7></a> Without pretending to be very learned, I know Greek, and I have studied the Greek Testament, and I have not been led to place any confidence in their statements about the Greek, but the contrary.<a name=1:8></a> The Spirit of God will guide more surely a plain man, if he be humble, in fundamental truths, than a little Greek will those who trust in it.<a name=1:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, to a plain man, the statements of his English Bible leave not a doubt on the mind that the punishment of the wicked is eternal.<a name=1:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These statements, I have no doubt whatever, are substantially right.<a name=1:11></a> No doubt, being a human work, translations are imperfect, and the translator's views and feelings are apt to be transfused into them.<a name=1:12></a> But in the main, the doctrine presented by the English Bible, and the faith produced by it in a plain believer's mind, is sound doctrine and divinely-taught faith, though it be possible some passages might be more exactly

		rendered.<a name=2:1></a> None, however, that I am aware, affecting this truth are misrepresented by the translation.<a name=2:2></a> And it is quite evident to me, and to any plain honest man, that God <i>meant to produce on the mind of the reader</i> the conviction that eternal misery is the portion of the wicked, and I do not believe that <i>He meant to produce the conviction of a lie</i>, nor frighten them with what was not true.<a name=2:3></a> Now I shall quote many plain passages, adding my unhesitating conviction that the attempts to undermine this doctrine of scripture (and I have been compelled to examine a good many) have entirely failed, and that the arguments used are either dishonest, some of them flagrantly so, or contradictory and fallacious, and that all of them subvert other fundamental truths.<a name=2:4></a> And I declare also my conviction that a sound knowledge of Greek confirms the plain man's scriptural faith.<a name=2:5></a> I shall state why in a few plain words at the end.<a name=2:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I give a body of texts (some of which by themselves might not prove the point), that the effect the Holy Ghost meant to produce may be wrought according to the full testimony He has given.<a name=2:7></a> I beg the plain reader's attention to these passages.<a name=2:8></a> Some refute the doctrine of the salvation of all; some, the notion that the wicked will perish, i.<a name=2:9></a>e.<a name=2:10></a>, cease to exist.<a name=2:11></a> Some shew that the human notion of divine love, which denies the vindication of God's majesty and holiness against sin by wrath, and the eternal impossibility that light should have fellowship with darkness, is an unscriptural and an unholy notion.<a name=2:12></a> Some refute particular arguments used in favour of these errors.<a name=2:13></a> So that, if the mind be solidly imbued with these passages, the error is confuted; and, lastly, some of them shew, that the doctrine of scripture is, that there is wrath, and that everlasting misery and punishment is the portion of unbelieving and rebellious sinners.<a name=2:14></a> Some shew that it applies to all kinds of sinners, without law, under law, and unbelievers of the gospel.<a name=2:15></a>

		Now no one can deny that the effect of these passages is, to lead men to believe that the wrath of God is revealed against all ungodliness, as well as His love in Christ; that, if this love be despised, and the gospel rejected, damnation is the consequence; that, as to those who come under wrath, their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched; that they have never forgiveness; that they are not saved, but perish; and that they are tormented for ever and ever in the lake of fire and brimstone; that having despised the sacrifice of the cross, there is no more sacrifice for sin.<a name=3:17></a> But men seek to evade these plain testimonies, and begin to reason, and to speak of Greek.<a name=3:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now there are two systems by which men seek to set aside these plain passages.<a name=3:19></a> One is that all will be saved, all, even the devil himself, though some few of them do not like to say anything so plain as that.<a name=3:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#3:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>In those two verses, 40 and 49, it will be said "world" means age or dispensation; be it so, I believe it does; but that does not affect the judgment pronounced as to that which is to follow.

	<div class="footnote">

		The other is, that the wicked will not be saved (the soul not being immortal at all), and that the fire of hell will in time consume them.<a name=4:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now these two systems quite destroy one another.<a name=4:2></a> It is the latter which most prevails here in England, the former in other countries.<a name=4:3></a> Those who hold the latter say that the former is monstrous and unscriptural: first, because of the passages which declare that some people are to be damned and others saved, and very many which speak of destroying body and soul in hell, or something of equal force; and also because, if they are saved, they are saved without the atonement and regeneration, for there are those who have rejected the one and despised the other, and for whom there remains no more sacrifice for sin.<a name=4:4></a> And indeed nothing can be plainer.<a name=4:5></a> And so as to the devil and his angels.<a name=4:6></a> For, to be consistent with their views, they must save them too.<a name=4:7></a> For they say God is to be all in all, and, being love, there can remain no misery.<a name=4:8></a> But if so, the devils must be saved too.<a name=4:9></a> But then, they have no Christ, no Saviour; so that, according to this doctrine, if I tell a man he cannot be saved without Christ, I am not telling him true, for there are those who are, according to this system.<a name=4:10></a> That is, the whole gospel is subverted as to every one.<a name=4:11></a> But is it not plain to an honest mind that when it is said "he that believeth shall be saved, and he that believeth not shall be damned," this does not mean "he that believeth not" shall be equally saved with him that believes -- only he shall be punished for awhile first?<a name=4:12></a> For that is the doctrine of the first class, or Universalists, as they are called.<a name=4:13></a> And when it is said, they which believe on Him "should not perish, but have everlasting life," is it not equally plain that it does not mean that, though they would not believe, they would still have it and not perish at all?<a name=4:14></a> And when it is said "whose end is destruction," it does not mean that their end should be to be in happiness like others, though they waited a little longer?<a name=4:15></a> And when it is said "hath never forgiveness," that it does not mean one will have it in the end?<a name=4:16></a> And when it says, "where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched," that it does not mean they are to get out of it safe and sound and to be in glory like the saved?<a name=4:17></a> God has said, "these shall go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into life eternal.<a name=4:18></a>" Now, who would believe that this meant that the condemned were to go for a short time into punishment, but had or would

	<div class="paragraph">
		have eternal life quite as much as the others?<a name=5:1></a> Eternal life and eternal or everlasting punishment answer to one another, and mean the same in either case.<a name=5:2></a> They argue that it means eternal in neither!<a name=5:3></a> But will any one believe that "eternal life" does not mean life for ever and ever?<a name=5:4></a> If its lasting for ever is only to be understood from the word "life," because it is Christ's life, why add the word eternal?<a name=5:5></a> The plain reader will hardly believe that they say eternal is added to confine it to the next age, or millennium!<a name=5:6></a><a href="#5:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> But this is quite a fallacy; for <i>we</i> are said to have it <i>now</i>, before the millennium comes at all.<a name=5:7></a> "He that believeth on the Son <i>hath</i> everlasting life.<a name=5:8></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The punishment of the wicked, then, is said to be of equal duration with the life of the blessed.<a name=5:9></a> But further it is said to be of equal duration with the life of God.<a name=5:10></a> In <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#5:14">Revelation  5:14</a>, it is said that they worship Him who liveth for <i>ever and ever</i>.<a name=5:11></a> And in chapter 14: 11, it is said, the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever.<a name=5:12></a> Now if the punishment of the wicked is said to endure as long as the life of the blessed, and as the life of God Himself, I ask, how could God have expressed more strongly to living men its enduring everlastingly?<a name=5:13></a> If He has said "it hath never forgiveness" -- if He has said "their worm dieth not" -- what could God have said more if He had meant to convey what eternal punishment was?<a name=5:14></a> And note here, that <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#20">Revelation  20</a>, where they are said to be in the lake of fire without, is after the millennium, and all is over, when it is said <i>It is done</i>, and God is all in all.<a name=5:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence the advocates of the second system of error have declared that the first has long been proved entirely absurd and untenable; and they have set up another, namely:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That the soul is not immortal at all, and that death means simply ceasing to exist, and therefore, that life is to be found only in Christ; and that, after a certain quantity of punishment, the wicked will be turned out of existence, or consumed by the fire of hell, and exist no more.<a name=5:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such is the doctrine much in vogue, in this country, on this subject.<a name=5:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, upon the face of this doctrine the grossest inconsistency at once appears.<a name=5:18></a> For, if death means ceasing to exist, the soul not being immortal at all, and that anything beyond this is found only in Christ, how come the wicked to be alive after death in order to be punished?<a name=5:19></a> Where do they get this life?<a name=5:20></a>

		They cannot be alive to be punished at all.<a name=6:1></a> "He that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath not the Son of God, hath not life," say they.<a name=6:2></a> Now, if this means literally that the wicked have not life beyond death, they cannot exist when dead to be punished.<a name=6:3></a> It is quite clear to a Christian man, that "life" is used here in the sense of life in which we live to God in blessedness; for having no life is said of those who <i>are</i> naturally alive, but are dead in trespasses and sins.<a name=6:4></a> They have no divine life or blessedness, instead of being dead to sin and alive unto God.<a name=6:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But then the scripture is most clear and positive, that there is wrath and punishment and judgment and torment after death for all who are not saved.<a name=6:6></a> And this they cannot deny, without denying the whole testimony of God.<a name=6:7></a> But if there is, then men do live after death; and death does not mean ceasing to exist, but ceasing to exist <i>soul and body together in this world</i>.<a name=6:8></a> And that is what is as plain as possible from scripture.<a name=6:9></a> "It is appointed unto men once to die, and AFTER THIS the judgment.<a name=6:10></a>" Why here, the judgment, which is to bring on men the whole extent of the consequences of sin from the wrath of God, is after death.<a name=6:11></a> Though sin makes always miserable; yet the coming of wrath, in the true full sense of the word, does not begin till after death, and by judgment, instead of death being the end of the man.<a name=6:12></a> And mark, this is not anything peculiar to those that have heard of Christ, though they doubtless are far more guilty and will be beaten with many stripes.<a name=6:13></a> It is appointed <i>unto men</i>.<a name=6:14></a> It is their common natural portion as sinners<a href="#6:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> -- death and judgment.<a name=6:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, "Fear not them which kill the body, but after that have no more that they can do, but fear him who after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell.<a name=6:16></a>" Now here death (instead of being the whole wages of sin, though it be its wages) is made comparatively light of, if taken alone, but what comes after in body and soul in hell is the thing to be feared.<a name=6:17></a> And note, there is no such thought as a man's soul dying with his body, as they say who teach that simple death was the whole wages of sin, alleging the passage; "In the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die.<a name=6:18></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		That is, we have the positive revelation of God, that their comment is a false one, that death is not the whole wages of sin, but that judgment comes after it.<a name=7:11></a> But then, to get out of this, they say that death was the wages of Adam's sin, but that these punishments are the wages of our own.<a name=7:12></a> Now the apostle does not state the matter so.<a name=7:13></a> He says, "and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.<a name=7:14></a>" That is, he connects the sin of all men and Adam's sin together, as bringing in death itself on all; so that this will not do either.<a name=7:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But were it even not thus disproved by the apostle's statement, there is another thing remains: if Adam's sin brought in death on all his posterity, and man is not immortal (for that is their doctrine), where do sinners get the life from after death (that is, after ceasing to exist at all)?<a name=7:16></a> Their sins cannot give it them.<a name=7:17></a> They tell us that, death having been pronounced on man, there is no immortality, no life, but in Christ.<a name=7:18></a> Well then, see what it comes to: the wicked have life in Christ in order to be punished for their sins, and this life, which they have in Christ, is not eternal life: for if it be, they must be (if not eternally happy or saved) eternally miserable.<a name=7:19></a> And moreover, this life, which they have of Christ to be punished in, is to be consumed by the wrath and punishment of God!<a name=7:20></a> If it is not life in and from Christ, then death does not put an end to a man; death is not what they pretend it is; man is, in a word, an immortal being.<a name=7:21></a> And further, what was the worth of Christ's death?<a name=7:22></a> Some of them say it was just simply

		the reader will find that eternal life is quite as often said of our having Christ's life in this world as in the next; because it is that divine life which is a real thing given us, as true in this world as in the next.<a name=9:1></a> Its full development is in the next, of course, and therefore we naturally speak of it as there; but scripture equally states that we have it here; so that it certainly does not mean a millennial condition, though we have it then as now.<a name=9:2></a> The word translated "for ever,"<a href="#9:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> does sometimes mean, when used in other ways, what is not eternal.<a name=9:3></a> It is used for the duration of anything in uninterrupted continuance, though the thing in its nature may not last for ever, and hence for the whole of any particular period -- as the whole of man's life, sometimes the whole course of this evil world, the whole of a dispensation.<a name=9:4></a> But when it is used in connection with the subjects we are treating of, there is not the least doubt it means eternal, and indeed wherever it is not used with a particular subject which limits it; and when translated for ever, it never means the millennial age, as alleged.<a name=9:5></a>

		Many other arguments from the use of it in Greek might be urged; but I do not go farther here, as I might only perplex those who do not understand that language.<a name=9:6></a> In a passage which relates to our subject we have plain proof, however, that "everlasting" does not mean millennial.<a name=9:7></a> For it is said, "depart, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.<a name=9:8></a>" Now, on their own shewing, the devil and his angels are not there till the millennium is over; so that it does <i>not</i> mean millennial.<a name=9:9></a> Further, they insist on the words "destroy" and "destruction.<a name=9:10></a>" Now we have already shewn, it cannot here mean to put an end to the existence of what is destroyed; because it lasts as long as the life of the blessed, and even of God Himself.<a name=9:11></a> But that it does not mean so in many passages is plain.<a name=9:12></a> The very title given to the angel of the bottomless pit would shew it.<a name=9:13></a> He is called Apollyon, i.<a name=9:14></a>e.<a name=9:15></a>, the destroyer; now he ruins no doubt many, but he cannot

Not one can be brought to shew that it refers to the millennial time of glory. We have the expressions THIS world, and the world TO COME, as to which men may reason, but never the words above used.

		The result of our examination is to leave in its full force eternal punishment (the terrible consequence of the enmity of man's heart against God), and eternal blessedness (the result of God's free and blessed grace), in their plain scriptural sense, as commonly believed by simple-minded Christians.<a name=10:13></a> It is equally clear that the just divine vengeance which inflicts the punishment will know how to apportion the many stripes and the few stripes, to distinguish duly those who perish without law and those who are judged by law (though all be shut out from the presence of God, as in the judgment which devours the adversaries); and that the sovereign divine grace

		The thought is indeed solemn: but I can say that the examination of scripture on the subject has not left a cloud on my mind as to the truth taught in it; while the examination of the systems opposed to it has satisfied me, that they are fallacious and superficial, not taught by the Spirit of God, nor the truth of the word; and that sound and full examination of the Greek they plead confounds their statements.<a name=11:2></a>

		Now any plain godly reader can judge from such quotations as these what such an argument is worth; for it is clear that nothing but exceeding inattention, or positive dishonesty, could apply such passages as having anything to say to it.<a name=12:15></a> First, as to Genesis, it is most plain, that it is God's patience with man before the flood, while the ark was a preparing, when, according to Peter's comment, the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah.<a name=12:16></a> Their spirits being cast into prison, when thus judged, is plain proof enough that they subsisted after their death.<a name=12:17></a>

		My Dear Wigram, <br>The pamphlet you have sent me <i>has</i> a voice, which, though it may <i>be</i> in a disagreeable way, has given <i>me</i> pleasure.<a name=14:2></a> For it <i>surely</i> proves that <i>my</i> tract has taken effect; and the effort to undo the testimony is so utter a failure, that it confirms me in the conviction that the Lord was with me in the matter of the publication.<a name=14:3></a> I have been even much struck with the way in which some very important points acquire new weight by the utter inability to meet them.<a name=14:4></a> I return you a notice of the tract, in case you should have need for any one: of course, I pass by all the abuse.<a name=14:5></a>

		As regards the second paragraph, I was not aware that the writer went so far in error as he does.<a name=15:5></a> He tells us that the eternal life here spoken of is a reward life.<a name=15:6></a> Now I read in scripture that <i>eternal (aionios)</i> life is the <i>gift of God</i>, not the reward of works, though its full enjoyment may close and crown them.<a name=15:7></a> As to the persons referred to in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#25">Matthew  25</a>, I believe they are the Gentiles living on the earth when the Lord comes.<a name=15:8></a> What then?<a name=15:9></a> What has that to do with the duration of the punishment inflicted on them?<a name=15:10></a> They are unbelievers and believers, as I judge, and the third class are the messengers from among the Jewish people, as I apprehend; their reception of them, as bringing the word of testimony, the Lord considers as being equivalent to receiving Himself, though they, on receiving graciously the messenger, were unaware that the Lord took it as done to Himself.<a name=15:11></a> That was all they were ignorant of: and what has that to say to the duration of the punishment of the goats, who also were ignorant that, in rejecting the messenger, they would be treated as rejecting the Lord Himself?<a name=15:12></a> Otherwise, note, the special privilege called eternal life is obtained by natural kind conduct, with no real motive which refers to Christ at all; for they acted in ignorance of what they were about and that which merited eternal life, which redemption does not acquire for any one.<a name=15:13></a> Mr.<a name=15:14></a> S.<a name=15:15></a> says, page 6, "It is not said, everlasting torment"; but the only other time <i>kolasis is</i> used, it is translated torment in the English version, and rightly enough, though punishment be equally well given as the sense here.<a name=15:16></a> Mr.<a name=15:17></a> S.<a name=15:18></a> says, the word is age-lasting punishment.<a name=15:19></a> That is easily said; it is what I positively deny: his business is to prove, not to say it.<a name=15:20></a> I shall quote farther on some passages to shew that it cannot be assumed to be so.<a name=15:21></a> Next he says, as minister of the circumcision, the Lord refers to <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#66">Isaiah  66</a>.<a name=15:22></a> This is an unhappy remark, because the Lord positively declares that this applies to Gentiles, and His throne as Son of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, it is stated (page 16), that there is another word for endless applied to "life by Christ.<a name=24:4></a>" But Mr.<a name=24:5></a> S.<a name=24:6></a> carefully abstains from telling us where.<a name=24:7></a> It is a pity, too, he has not told us what the word is.<a name=24:8></a> There is no such word that I know of or can find.<a name=24:9></a> There is a word applied to Christ Himself (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#7:16">Hebrews  7:16</a>), "according to the power of an endless life," in reference to His priesthood; but this has nothing to do with the question: it is the inherent nature of Christ's life, and means indissoluble.<a name=24:10></a> And not only so, but the reference to such a passage would be most unhappy, because the proof given that Christ has a priesthood of such a nature is, that He is so <i>eis ton aiona</i>.<a name=24:11></a> That is, the word said by Mr.<a name=24:12></a> S.<a name=24:13></a> to mean a period which is not endless, in contrast with this power of an endless life, is <i>the</i> word used here to prove that the life is endless.<a name=24:14></a> "Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.<a name=24:15></a> For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever <i>[eis ton aiona]</i> after the order of Melchizedek.<a name=24:16></a>" The truth is, that in this phrase <i>aiona</i> cannot be referred to the millennium, nor to an age, as a short specific period, because it would be rather till the millennium.<a name=24:17></a> So in the passage <a href="../bible/John.htm#6">John  6</a>, he that eateth this bread shall live to the millennium, which would be absurd.<a name=24:18></a> It is just simply for ever.<a name=24:19></a> Again, verses 22, 25, as to the Jewish priests, death forbade them to continue, "but this man, because he continueth for ever <i>[eis ton aiona]</i> hath an unchangeable priesthood, wherefore he is able to save to the uttermost them that come to God by him, seeing he ever <i>[pantote]</i> liveth to make intercession for them.<a name=24:20></a>" Here again, <i>eis ton aiona</i> (for ever) is used as the opposite to liability to cessation because of death; that is, to have eternal continuance is equivalent to endless, unceasing life.<a name=24:21></a> Further, the great argument used is, that <i>aionial</i> (or eternal) does not mean endless, but millennial.<a name=24:22></a> If it does not, the whole question is decided, because punishment is declared to be <i>aionial</i> (eternal).<a name=24:23></a>

		SCRIPTURAL ENQUIRIES AS TO SOME OF THE DOCTRINES CONTAINED IN J.P. HAM'S THEOLOGICAL TRACTS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will not disapprove my following the advice you give the readers of your Theological Tracts (which the Holy Spirit Himself gives us), by proving what you have presented to them, as well as what is presented by the Protestant Churches.<a name=27:1></a> I have proved the latter now many years ago, at least in some measure.<a name=27:2></a> But the apostle tells me to prove <i>all things</i>; and my experience teaches me that it is quite as needful to prove new things as old.<a name=27:3></a> Indeed the need of it is more obvious; for old may be approved by the long experience of true saints as sure ground for their souls, and what is new has certainly to be proved at first.<a name=27:4></a> The approbation of centuries has no weight at all with me.<a name=27:5></a> Nor even is the constant faith of the saints in all ages a measure or a proof of truth; but neither is a light disregard of it a proof of a state of soul which gives competency to judge of truth.<a name=27:6></a> Christ brought in new things; but the well-instructed scribe possessed the old, and held them fast.<a name=27:7></a> Our whole enquiry must be, as to either new or old -- Are they in the word?<a name=27:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I judge that some remarks you have made on the subject of resurrection are just.<a name=27:9></a> The Church <i>had</i> greatly lost sight of it: it had along with it lost sight of the Lord's coming, and hence had used language as to the separate state of the soul, which I judge to be quite unscriptural.<a name=27:10></a> The statement I thus make will, I trust, tend to assure you that I am not prejudiced against your views, as if governed by ecclesiastical orthodoxy.<a name=27:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think there has been entire failure where you judge that there has; and I judge it to be a very great and real evil.<a name=27:12></a> But you cannot deny the tendency of man's mind to run into some opposite extreme, when offended by an error.<a name=27:13></a> These moral Scyllas have been the wreck of many a mind, which had rightly avoided some Charybdis, that had too much engrossed their attention.<a name=27:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I take your examination of <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5">2 Corinthians  5</a>.<a name=28:2></a> Now I agree with you that mortality being swallowed up of life is not the soul's going to heaven -- that our house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens, is not the separate state.<a name=28:3></a> Nor is mortality being swallowed up of life accomplished till our full glorious state -- our house not made with hands -- is put on.<a name=28:4></a> I further admit, that Paul in this passage does not express any desire of death.<a name=28:5></a> Nay, he even says that was not the object which occupied his desires, but something else.<a name=28:6></a> Thus far (and they are very important points) we agree.<a name=28:7></a> I believe, as you do, that he connected this state of glory with the coming of the Lord Jesus.<a name=28:8></a> But then the apostle goes farther.<a name=28:9></a> His desire is that mortality might be swallowed up of life.<a name=28:10></a> Now mortality was his present state in the body; not when (according to your idea) body and soul had ceased to exist, but when he was groaning, being burdened, and desired that life, which he possessed, might, in the power in which Christ had overcome death, swallow up all trace of mortality.<a name=28:11></a> He does not say how this was to be; but had he been changed and never seen death, this would have taken place, and given the full proof of the power of this life, and the just and only adequate force of the apostle's expression.<a name=28:12></a> He so saw the glory, and what he possessed already, as wrought of God for this self-same thing, that he wished the power of life which he possessed to swallow up mortality.<a name=28:13></a> Of course resurrection will produce the same effect in result; but Paul was comparing his present condition and the glory before him, and applies (in desire) the power of life in Christ, of which he was made partaker already, to the present production of this result.<a name=28:14></a> The mortality (to <i>thneton)</i> was what he had while alive.<a name=28:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having thus spoken of the sense of the passage, allow me to examine some of your comments.<a name=28:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And forgive me if I judge that you have made the apostle say many things which he has not said, and attached meanings to his words which ought to be proved, not asserted.<a name=28:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You make him say, "'We are confident,' I say, of so glorious a re-creation in Christ Jesus awaiting us; and are, therefore 'willing rather to be absent from the body,' that is, from our 'natural body,' our present mortal and corruptible nature which separates us from the Lord, and to be possessed of our

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now you cannot deny that the greater part of what you make the apostle say here, he does not say.<a name=29:2></a> He says none of the things which concern your doctrine.<a name=29:3></a> He does not say "and be possessed of our spiritual body"; he does not say, "our new incorruptible nature, that we may be present with the Lord"; and when you say, "which cannot be until the resurrection," it only applies to what you say, not to what the apostle says.<a name=29:4></a> He does not say that he was confident of so glorious a re-creation; nor does he say he is confident of anything, a sense in which the word employed is never used in the New Testament.<a name=29:5></a><a href="#29:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> It means, to be of a confident spirit, of good courage, bold.<a name=29:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The 'therefore' is not connected, as you make it, with this glorious future state, as making him confident, but with what he already possessed while in the body.<a name=29:7></a> "Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.<a name=29:8></a> Therefore we are always confident," etc.<a name=29:9></a> Now you cannot fail to see how immensely important this is to the whole question.<a name=29:10></a> It was what Paul had already as God's workmanship, which made him so courageous at all times.<a name=29:11></a> Now if all this was totally to perish -- that is, if what God had made him to be was, "He that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing" -- how could that inspire him with confidence?<a name=29:12></a> The utter total perishing of what God had wrought was a strange ground of boldness.<a name=29:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And remark here that your doctrine involves believers in the same plight as sinners.<a name=29:14></a> In vain God has wrought in them by the same power as in Christ when He raised Him from the dead, <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:19">Ephesians  1:19</a>, 20.<a name=29:15></a> In vain that which is born of the Spirit is spirit, <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:6">John  3:6</a>.<a name=29:16></a> In vain Christ Himself is their life, <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3:4">Colossians  3:4</a>.<a name=29:17></a> And, because He lives, they shall live also, <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:19">John  14:19</a>.<a name=29:18></a> No: body, soul, spirit, the life they have in Christ, all perish together.<a name=29:19></a> The earnest of the Spirit goes.<a name=29:20></a> The Holy Ghost abandons them.<a name=29:21></a> Do you believe that that eternal life which they have in the Son (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:11">1 John  5:11</a>) perishes; or that they have it not really?<a name=29:22></a>

		Again, you say, "The apostle desired to 'be' present with the Lord, <i>not as a disembodied soul</i>, for he says, 'not for that we would be <i>unclothed</i>.<a name=30:1></a>'" But the apostle never says that he desired to be absent from the body, but that he was willing rather.<a name=30:2></a> That is, not that it was his object of desire, but that he preferred it to being in the body.<a name=30:3></a> All this shews that you have not sufficiently taken account of what the apostle says.<a name=30:4></a> He did see the glory, and seeing it, would have mortality swallowed up of life, of that life whose power was already in him; for he was quickened together with Christ and by the same power -- Christ was his life.<a name=30:5></a> He knew God had wrought him for this glory, and he had received the earnest of the Spirit; so that, if death did come, he was not the less confident -- he would be willingly absent from the body and present with the Lord.<a name=30:6></a> And you will please to remember that he had <i>actual death</i> just before his eyes.<a name=30:7></a> He was writing to them about a persecution which had made him despair "even of life.<a name=30:8></a>" Now it was not his desire to die, but to be glorified; but so well did he know that he had life in power of Christ risen, that if he did die, he knew he would only gain by it.<a name=30:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You tell us that "absent from the body" means having received it again in glory.<a name=30:10></a> I say <i>it</i>, because the apostle says, "it is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption; it is sown an animal body, it is raised a spiritual body.<a name=30:11></a>" But does it not seem strange that "absent from the body" should mean taking it in glory?<a name=30:12></a> It does not say so at least.<a name=30:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, you say, "Man, the one compound being, is compared to an 'earthly <i>house' or</i> 'tabernacle' which will be '<i>dissolved</i>.<a name=30:14></a>'" Why man, the one compound being?<a name=30:15></a> Compounded of what?<a name=30:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You tell <i>us</i> that saints are to put on Christ -- to put on incorruption, and hence that these expressions cannot allude to the body as distinct from the soul.<a name=30:17></a> Now I admit that the corruptible may put on incorruption, or a man put on a character; that is, put on may be used as a figure of a change of state or character.<a name=30:18></a> But you have not quite seized the force of the argument here.<a name=30:19></a> It lies in the word "tabernacle," not in putting on or off.<a name=30:20></a> Now I humbly conceive that an earthly dwelling-place of a tabernacle does suppose some one dwelling in it; that is the idea conveyed by the figure.<a name=30:21></a> And you must remember that the Holy Ghost dwelt in the apostle, and that he that is joined to the Lord is one spirit.<a name=30:22></a> I his surely is not part

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the apostle certainly does not speak of man -- the one compound being.<a name=31:3></a> He speaks of being in a tabernacle which made him groan; he speaks of the tabernacle being dissolved, not of <i>his</i> being dissolved; he speaks of his having a building of God, eternal in the heavens.<a name=31:4></a> That is, his language is entirely the opposite of what you have felt necessary to the support of your argument.<a name=31:5></a> He does not speak of a compound being, but of a tabernacle in which he was, and which made him groan.<a name=31:6></a> the apostle's words are not at all what you make him say.<a name=31:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You do well to deal with the passages which you consider the strongholds of those opposed to the doctrine.<a name=31:8></a> But you must be aware that there are other passages which treat of the subject, which you would have done well to have considered along with this one, as naturally suggesting themselves.<a name=31:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I suppose you believe that Christ was as truly a man (though truly God) as we are.<a name=31:10></a> What did He mean when He said, "Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit"?<a name=31:11></a> And when He said to the poor thief, "To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise"?<a name=31:12></a> Surely He did not deceive him.<a name=31:13></a> This is the more important because the thief was looking for the time of glory, and hoped to be remembered then, and said, "Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.<a name=31:14></a>" But the Lord (who could bring out of His treasures things new and old) would not leave him, as you would leave us, without hope till then; but assured him of that new thing, for He brought life to light by the gospel, as well as incorruption.<a name=31:15></a> "To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise.<a name=31:16></a>" Was Christ there without a soul?<a name=31:17></a> Had He not a human soul?<a name=31:18></a> What became of it at His death?<a name=31:19></a> And remember, if He lives, I do.<a name=31:20></a> The thief's body was on the cross, Christ's in the tomb.<a name=31:21></a> How was he in paradise with Christ?<a name=31:22></a> Again, Stephen -- to whom the heaven was opened, and who was full of the Holy Ghost -- was he deceived when he said, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit," just in the words of his Master, with the reflection of whose glory his face shone?<a name=31:23></a> But he was full of the Spirit, suffered like his Master, and looked to being with Him.<a name=31:24></a> Again, the apostle says, that to die is gain, though to live is Christ (<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#1:20">Philippians  1:20</a>-23).<a name=31:25></a> Now it is hard to suppose that dying is gain, if it is merely the dissolution of my whole being.<a name=31:26></a> But this is not all.<a name=31:27></a> The apostle in this passage is discussing life and death.<a name=31:28></a> Now having

		this as his subject (without speaking of future glory) he says, that to depart and be with Christ is far better.<a name=32:1></a> Here, <i>dying is</i> gain, and he explains this by saying that departing and being with Christ is far better, but that he should continue with them for their profit.<a name=32:2></a> Now permit me to observe, if "departing" alluded to all the saints going up into glory in resurrection, the apostle could not contrast continuing with them with that departing.<a name=32:3></a> There would be no sense in what he says, for then we shall all go up together.<a name=32:4></a> His departing from them was then by death in contrast with his continuing with them, yet he thought it "far better," though "to live is Christ.<a name=32:5></a>" Again, I read of body, soul, and spirit being sanctified; so that scripture distinguishes these things very clearly.<a name=32:6></a> I read, the end of faith is salvation of souls.<a name=32:7></a> I read of those "who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul.<a name=32:8></a>" Surely this teaches me to distinguish between them; and to distinguish between them in death.<a name=32:9></a> Again, when I read of souls under the altar before Christ's coming to judgment, I admit it is a figure, but it is not a figure to represent that such beings do not exist at all.<a name=32:10></a> White robes are given them, and they are told to wait.<a name=32:11></a> Now I might force the figure perhaps to mean that, in God's sight, their martyrdom cried for vengeance; but how white robes could be given to what did not exist, would be hard to tell.<a name=32:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In a word, I find your tract representing the apostle as saying what he does not say at all, and that you forget a crowd of passages which are opposed in the plainest way to what you make him say.<a name=32:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		Allow me to add, though it be another subject, that no true Christian denies that abundant mercy has saved him; but that abundant mercy has so made him feel his sins, that he knows that they must be put away from before the eyes of Him who is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity, and cannot look at sin.<a name=34:11></a> He believes that Christ has put them away -- has borne them in His own body on the tree; that by His stripes he is healed; and hence that God is just, and the justifier of him that believes in Jesus.<a name=34:12></a> He does not doubt the mercy.<a name=34:13></a> He knows it is sovereign goodness; but the way that grace has operated is in the gift of His Son for the putting away of sin by the sacrifice of Himself.<a name=34:14></a> Do you believe this?<a name=34:15></a> The love shewn in this is not perhaps always sufficiently put forward; but denying the justice of God (that is, His righteous hatred of sin, and the judgment due to it) is not the scriptural way of enhancing the love.<a name=34:16></a> Whatever men may do, scripture, while telling us that God is love, tells us that His righteousness is revealed in the gospel -- His righteousness for us -- blessed be God -- still His righteousness.<a name=34:17></a> It tells us, that we are made His righteousness in Christ.<a name=34:18></a> It tells us, that wrath is revealed from heaven.<a name=34:19></a> It speaks of a wrath to come, from which Christ has delivered us; that it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of a living God; that if Christ be denied, there is only a fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation which shall devour the adversaries.<a name=34:20></a> This is not what it delights to dwell on; it comes on purpose to speak of love.<a name=34:21></a> If it speaks of wrath itself, it is in order that men may escape it.<a name=34:22></a> It is love that speaks, where wrath is spoken of.<a name=34:23></a> But it does not conceal --

		former tract, as deserving to be taken up distinctly.<a name=41:1></a> I mean the force of the word <i>Eternal</i> in the original, and the real scriptural doctrine as to Christ's death.<a name=41:2></a> I shall say a few words on the first, from its close connection with the whole subject, and because the denial of the force of the word "eternal" is always connected with low views of sin, and a false estimate of Christ's death; and ends in a practical denial of it.<a name=41:3></a> Though I have found such loose notions as to what "eternal" means, always accompanied by unbelief in the real atoning efficacy of the sacrifice of Jesus, still, the latter lying at the foundation of all relationship as Christians with God, I shall treat it last, and more fully than the first; and I shall shew, as I did as to the former points, so as to this yet still more important one, that you have garbled the scripture you quoted by important omissions, denied some of its plainest statements, and left aside a mass of the plainest truths it teaches.<a name=41:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I turn to the word "eternal.<a name=41:5></a>" The word used in the Greek Testament, as it is well known to those familiar with it, is <i>aionios</i>, formed from <i>aion</i>.<a name=41:6></a> This latter word is used in classical Greek writers for "man's life," and in scripture for "a dispensation" (or course of events in this world ordered of God on some particular principle), as well as in the sense of "for ever.<a name=41:7></a>" Homer, Herodotus, and the Attic poets use it in the former sense, and say, he breathed out his life <i>[aiona]</i>.<a name=41:8></a> In this sense, evidently, we have nothing to do with it.<a name=41:9></a> It has the general force of one continuous existence on a given principle of life.<a name=41:10></a> Again, it is figuratively used for the continuous subsistence of a given system going on in the same principle -- as for example, the dispensation which was to close by Christ's coming.<a name=41:11></a> Hence the word is used for the course of this world, as always going on in the same uniform manner.<a name=41:12></a> But its proper force being continuous uninterrupted existence, it is particularly applied to that in its highest sense; that is, to eternity and to God.<a name=41:13></a> That this is its real sense, I shall bring the best authority to prove, and then examples from scripture in which it is so used, and in which it is impossible it should be taken in any other way.<a name=41:14></a>

		Thus Aristotle declares that its force is <i>aien on</i>, always existing: we could hardly have a clearer expression for God or eternity.<a name=41:15></a> If anything can be more express, it is Philo's explanation of it.<a name=41:16></a> Philo was a Hellenistic Jew, who flourished in the time of the apostles, and hence is the best possible

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another remarkable proof, that this was the force of the word, is its being the term used for certain imaginary beings, of which oriental philosophy (which had adopted some names and natures from the Christian revelation, and in this shape sought to call itself Christian) made the main fabric of its theories to consist.<a name=42:4></a> They were called <i>aiones</i>, because they were immortal and unchangeable.<a name=42:5></a> The following is a part of Mosheim's note on this subject, whose learning no one, I suppose, will dispute.<a name=42:6></a> "<i>Aion</i> properly signifies indefinite or eternal duration, as opposed to that which is finite or temporal.<a name=42:7></a> It was, however, metonymically used for such natures as are in themselves unchangeable and immortal.<a name=42:8></a> That it was commonly applied in this sense even by the Greek philosophers at the time of Christ's birth, is plain from Arrian, who uses it to describe a nature the reverse of ours, superior to frailty and obnoxious to no vicissitude: <i>ou gar eimi Aion all anthropos meros ton panton os ora emeras enstenai me dei os ten oran kai parelthein os oran</i>.<a name=42:9></a> I am not an <i>Aion</i>, but a man, a part of all things, as an hour of a day, I must subsist as an hour, and pass away as an hour.<a name=42:10></a>" This contrast of <i>aion</i> with such passing away gives the clearest possible proof of the received force of the word.<a name=42:11></a> Thus its natural force, and the use of it in the time of Christ and the apostles, is clearly proved.<a name=42:12></a> I shall now shew from scripture that the word is there used properly and distinctively for eternal; and this by passages in which it can have no other meaning than that, and only that.<a name=42:13></a> <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4:18">2 Corinthians  4:18</a>: "The things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal [<i>aionia</i>].<a name=42:14></a>" Can anything be more positive than this?<a name=42:15></a> In the verse preceding: "an eternal <i>[aionion]</i> weight of glory.<a name=42:16></a>" <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5:1">2 Corinthians  5:1</a>: "A house not made with hands, eternal <i>[aionion]</i> in the heavens"; where the same contrast is maintained.<a name=42:17></a> <a href="../bible/Philemon.htm#15">Philemon  15</a>"Departed for a season that thou shouldest receive him for ever [<i>aionion</i>].<a name=42:18></a>" <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#6:16">1 Timothy  6:16</a>: "To whom [God] be honour and power everlasting [<i>aionion</i>].<a name=42:19></a>" <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#5:10">1 Peter  5:10</a>: "The God of all grace who hath called us to his eternal [<i>aionion</i>] glory.<a name=42:20></a>"

		Now as to the passages on which you reason in detail.<a name=51:18></a> "The wicked," you say, "are compared to chaff, to thorns cut up for rapid consumption in unquenchable fire.<a name=51:19></a>"
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards the latter, it is taken from <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#33:12">Isaiah  33:12</a>.<a name=52:1></a> But this only speaks of a present external judgment which would fall on the enemies of Jerusalem who came to spoil the Jews: they would perish on the earth, instead of executing their purpose.<a name=52:2></a> This is so entirely the case that, though in English translated "the people shall be as the burnings of lime, as thorns cut up," it is in the original "ammim" [peoples].<a name=52:3></a> This therefore has nothing whatever to say to the matter.<a name=52:4></a> It does not touch in the smallest way the question of the existence or state of a soul after death.<a name=52:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next, you say they are compared to chaff.<a name=52:6></a> This, as we have seen, refers exclusively to the language of John the Baptist: "Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.<a name=52:7></a>" Remark here that the whole is simply a figure, and, indeed, applies to the Lord's dealing with Israel, His floor.<a name=52:8></a> The good grain would be gathered into His garner; the chaff would undergo punishment, as chaff is burned in the fire -- hopeless and impossible to escape from.<a name=52:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Whether this figure means ceasing to exist is to be judged of from other passages.<a name=52:10></a> Now we have seen that the Lord speaks of abiding torment in the lake of fire.<a name=52:11></a> And in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13">Matthew  13</a>when He speaks of the tares being burned, He says, The wicked shall be cast into a furnace of fire: "there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.<a name=52:12></a>" They were not extinct then; they had not ceased to exist; so that I have the word of God declaring that it does not mean extinction.<a name=52:13></a> There are those who are tormented day and night for ever and ever.<a name=52:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this mere figure -- for the words are spoken of chaff, not of men, your interpretation of which is contradicted by a number of passages -- is really all you have to produce.<a name=52:15></a><a href="#52:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> You do not tell us so; we might suppose there were many such; but there are not.<a name=52:16></a> The same state is represented by being cast into outer darkness, where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth.<a name=52:17></a> Here there is no idea of extinction, or ceasing to exist.<a name=52:18></a>

		Now as to an undying worm, and fire unquenchable: they are figures, you say, borrowed from Isaiah.<a name=52:19></a> But figures of what?<a name=52:20></a> Extinction and ceasing to exist!<a name=52:21></a> Far from it.<a name=52:22></a> Exactly

		Peter says is, that the earth will be given up to fire in the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men; but not a word of the men being subject to it then.<a name=55:1></a> Now I believe, from <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#20">Revelation  20</a>, that the wicked congregated against the camp of the saints and the beloved city will be judged by fire coming down from heaven.<a name=55:2></a> But then the earth is not burned up.<a name=55:3></a> The lake of fire is there spoken of distinctly as something else (which, remark, has already subsisted for a thousand years, at any rate), the devil being then cast into it, and the beast and the false prophet being there, and to be tormented there for ever and ever.<a name=55:4></a> The lake of fire is certainly not then simply the consuming of the elements in a given day by fervent heat.<a name=55:5></a> The wicked, some of them, were in the lake of fire before, and it is another fire which comes down from heaven and consumes the wicked on earth -- a fire by which the world is not consumed.<a name=55:6></a> Nor are the wicked dead yet even raised.<a name=55:7></a> The apostle then sees a great white throne, and One that sat on it, before whose face the earth and heaven fled away; and then the dead, small and great, stand before Him (whereas the previous fire which destroyed the wicked on earth, had come down from heaven on the hosts on earth, who had gone up over the breadth of the earth), and they are judged out of the things written in the books.<a name=55:8></a> For this, the sea gave up her dead -- death and hades gave up theirs.<a name=55:9></a> They were judged; and there was a new heaven and a new earth; but the wicked have their part in the lake.<a name=55:10></a> Thus neither the living nor the dead wicked are consumed in the fire which melts the elements.<a name=55:11></a>

		Every part of your statement is, in the most positive way, contradicted by the text of scripture.<a name=55:12></a> The lake of fire existed at least a thousand years, and some were in it before the end.<a name=55:13></a> At the close the wicked in rebellion are destroyed on the earth by another fire which does not destroy the earth.<a name=55:14></a> The dead are then called up to be judged before the great white throne; the heaven and earth (which gives up its dead) fleeing from before the face of Him that sat upon it.<a name=55:15></a> Moreover, the resurrection of the just, or the first resurrection, is placed in this chapter a thousand years before this event; and it is at that epoch that the living wicked shall be punished with everlasting destruction from His presence.<a name=55:16></a> See <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#19">Revelation  19</a>, where He comes forth to execute it.<a name=55:17></a> For it is at His coming back from heaven the saints are raised to meet Him, and then appear in glory at the end (says the Lord) of this age; not when seated

		Now you will find that what I have just said is plainly shewn in the passages of the Old Testament which treat of it; and that they close in the human view by the boundary of death.<a name=57:3></a> You quote, for example, <a href="../bible/Ecclesiastes.htm#9:5">Ecclesiastes  9:5</a>: "But the dead know not anything": now how does this go on?<a name=57:4></a> "Neither have they any more a reward.<a name=57:5></a>" Do you believe that applies to anything beyond this world?<a name=57:6></a> You know well you do not; you teach the contrary.<a name=57:7></a> "For the memory of them is forgotten: also their love, and their hatred, and their envy is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in anything that is done under the sun.<a name=57:8></a>" Is it not as clear as the sun, that all this applies to this world, as does the whole book -- speaking of what is under the sun in the days of the life of our vanity?<a name=57:9></a>

		But you quote, as I stated, one more passage from the New Testament: "Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord, for they rest from their labours.<a name=60:6></a>" No doubt.<a name=60:7></a> We all believe that.<a name=60:8></a> But is that the whole passage?<a name=60:9></a> No.<a name=60:10></a> First there is added, "and their works do follow them.<a name=60:11></a>" Are they then extinct?<a name=60:12></a> But suffer me to ask you further, how I can think or pronounce people blessed who are extinct, or have ceased to exist.<a name=60:13></a> And mark, he does not (if I follow the way you quote the passage) say, Blessed are those who have risen again, but, "blessed are the dead.<a name=60:14></a>" Now it is impossible to conceive that a person who does not exist is blessed: indeed it is simple nonsense to say so.<a name=60:15></a> But the emphasis is on "who die in the Lord.<a name=60:16></a>" Now, if they are extinct, the same as ungodly people, why are they more blessed in death?<a name=60:17></a> for that is the time you refer it to.<a name=60:18></a> But, besides all this, you have not quoted the passage as it is in scripture -- a serious thing, it seems to me, when you profess to teach from it as God's word.<a name=60:19></a> The passage runs thus: "And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth.<a name=60:20></a>" Now of two things one: either, "from henceforth" refers to a particular prophetic moment, and therefore has nothing whatever to do with the extinction of a soul by death; or it is a positive revelation that people are immediately happy on their death.<a name=60:21></a> And when it is added, "and" (though they rest from their labours on earth), "their works do follow them," being connected with "from henceforth," directly contradicts that for which you quote it.<a name=60:22></a> Why did you leave out these words?<a name=60:23></a>

		You also quote the passage from the Psalms: "Thou wilt not leave my soul in hades," and argue that the application of it to Christ, is a proof that David's soul being left in hades, had ceased to exist.<a name=60:24></a> I should have thought that a soul's being left in hades, if it proved anything, proved that it did exist, or it could not be left there.<a name=60:25></a> The difference as to Christ was, that it was not left there; but both are supposed to exist, or they would not be thus reasoned about.<a name=60:26></a> It is quite true that

		I now turn to your statements on Christ's death; and if your error as to this is more important even than that which I have already noticed, so also your mis-statement of the contents of scripture is proportionately bolder.<a name=63:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would set out by saying, that it was God's free and perfect love which gave Christ for us, and which is the sole source of our salvation.<a name=63:2></a> Those who deny atonement (for you do deny it) in vain claim to be the only ones who believe in this love.<a name=63:3></a> Secondly, I should not deny that the way in which the gospel has been sometimes stated has obscured it; that is, that the effect has been, that God has been considered as simply a righteous being, and that Christ has died in love and propitiated Him.<a name=63:4></a> I say the effect; for those who preach in the most defective way on this point do not in the least deny that God's love is the source of all this; though practically their manner of putting it obscures this blessed truth -- that for wretched, lost, unhappy man, God has in infinite, compassionate, perfect as well as tender, love, given His Son, that whoever believes on Him may not perish, but have everlasting life.<a name=63:5></a> Blessed be God!<a name=63:6></a> He has done so; He has seen our need and visited us in it, and accomplished the perfect work needed to deliver us, and made sinners, through Christ, partakers of His glory.<a name=63:7></a> He calls us from sin and ruin by His testimony of His love in Christ.<a name=63:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		But love is not exalted by denying that righteousness which must display itself in wrath against sin.<a name=63:9></a> The only effect of such a denial is to destroy the sense of our need of this love, and in the same proportion (and that is indeed entirely) the sense of it, and the real restoration of the soul to God by it; that is, to destroy the knowledge of God.<a name=63:10></a> If my sins were such that the death of the divine Son of God was needed -- if God was so holy that He could not receive me unless my sins were washed away -- put away out of His sight, how great was <a name=64>[Page 64]</a>

		But let us examine your use of scripture.<a name=64:5></a> You are unknown to me; but surely you must be very inexperienced in the use of it, and quote it hastily, or I should not know what to think of your application of it, or your assertions about it.<a name=64:6></a> But I will examine them.<a name=64:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will take one of your "Leaves for Truth Lovers" entitled "The Death of Christ.<a name=64:8></a>" You say, "Fear or dread of God very often arises from not understanding the meaning of those expressions which state that Christ suffered for us, and shed His blood, or died for us.<a name=64:9></a>" Now I should have thought that that which would have produced fear or dread would have been such passages as "The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#9:17">Psalm  9:17</a>).<a name=64:10></a> They "shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power; when he shall come to be glorified in his saints and to be admired in all them that believe" (<a href="../bible/2Thessalonians.htm#1:9">2 Thessalonians  1:9</a>,10).<a name=64:11></a> "It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:31">Hebrews  10:31</a>).<a name=64:12></a> "Our God is a consuming fire" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12:29">Hebrews  12:29</a>).<a name=64:13></a> "Vengeance is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12:19">Romans  12:19</a>).<a name=64:14></a> "And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#14:11">Revelation  14:11</a>).<a name=64:15></a> And such like.<a name=64:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The death of Christ indeed gives the serious conviction of the solemn truth of the righteousness of God, in the "wrath of God revealed from heaven against all ungodliness, and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#1:18">Romans  1:18</a>), and that it is impossible that sinners, if not justified from their sins, should escape, since Christ could not when He took them.<a name=64:17></a> But while Christ's suffering for us

		thus confirms this most solemn truth, that there is and must be judgment against sin, still it carries with it the value of Another's taking it on Himself, and brings hope and encouragement by the love shewn in it, if not perfect peace yet.<a name=65:1></a> It makes us, if believed in, hate the sin that has made One who has so loved us suffer for it, and ourselves for it; but it is not dread it inspires.<a name=65:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I continue.<a name=65:3></a> You say, "They think that God is so severe that He would not pardon mankind without inflicting a most awful punishment either upon them, or upon Jesus Christ His Son as their substitute.<a name=65:4></a> But this is not the meaning of Christ's sufferings and death.<a name=65:5></a> Christ came into our world to assure us that God loves us dearly, and that He is ready to pardon and justify .<a name=65:6></a>.<a name=65:7></a>.<a name=65:8></a> .<a name=65:9></a> Now in shewing mankind this lovely image of God, He fell a victim to the wickedness of self-seeking men, who put Him to a violent death.<a name=65:10></a> In this way He suffered and died for us.<a name=65:11></a> Some persons say, that Christ's sufferings and death were a payment to God to liberate mankind from the charge of sin.<a name=65:12></a> But this cannot be true, because we are told by the apostle Paul, that 'God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself [not reconciling Himself unto the world], not imputing their trespasses unto them.<a name=65:13></a>' If God does not impute or reckon men's trespasses unto them, He could not be supposed to have made Christ suffer by way of reckoning for them.<a name=65:14></a> Besides, God says, 'I will be merciful to their unrighteousness [not I will exact satisfaction] and their sins and their iniquities I will remember no more.<a name=65:15></a>' God forgives sin, and therefore cannot have received any compensation for sin.<a name=65:16></a> If it were written in the Bible, instead of Christ suffered for us, Christ suffered as a punishment for us, then such doctrine would be clear; but no such language occurs anywhere in the Bible.<a name=65:17></a> This doctrine of satisfaction for sins represents Christ as having stood in our place to do something for us to God; but the true doctrine is, that Christ was in God's place to do something for God concerning us.<a name=65:18></a> Thus 'God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them' (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5:19">2 Corinthians  5:19</a>).<a name=65:19></a> 'We pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.<a name=65:20></a>'"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Were you really serious when you wrote all this?<a name=65:21></a> Did you really weigh your statements?<a name=65:22></a> For one hardly knows where to begin with such a multitude of mis-statements and errors.<a name=65:23></a> But, first, I shall separate out what is true in whole or in part.<a name=65:24></a>

		First, I fully admit that "Christ came into our world to assure us that God loves us dearly, and that he is ready to pardon and justify us.<a name=66:1></a>" I might not thus express it perhaps, but in the main substance of the thought I heartily agree.<a name=66:2></a> I only desire in my own spirit and testimony to be able better to bring out, that Christ was in the fullest way God's blessed witness of love to the world.<a name=66:3></a> Would to God it were more testified of, and more fully and freely, to this poor sinful and perishing world, which has such false ideas about God!<a name=66:4></a>

		I regret that I should have to turn to errors, when I have touched on this blessed subject; but your leaf forces me to do so.<a name=66:5></a> Further, although persons often mean substantially right in saying so, it is not scriptural to say Christ reconciled God to man: that He <i>made propitiation is</i>, and that is doubtless what preachers mean when they say so: but it is an unhappy expression, because it gives the idea of love being in Christ, and that, by His work, He has turned the mind of God towards us, who did not love us: whereas, though the righteous majesty of God did require the expiation for sin, and that the sin should be put away, still it was His own love that gave Christ for it, and thus brought the renewed and repentant sinner back to Himself, according to the power of the redemption accomplished by Christ -- his sins, his conscience, purged to enjoy the love witnessed in that redemption.<a name=66:6></a><a href="#66:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> Thus far, then, I am content to receive what you say: it is always well to clear our ground of that which is not in question.<a name=66:7></a>

		But now let us ask, Have you told us all that is said of Christ's death?<a name=66:8></a> Is what you have told us correct?<a name=66:9></a> Is it true that scripture does not say what you say it does not?<a name=66:10></a> Where you have quoted it, have you quoted it according to its intention as shewn by the context?<a name=66:11></a> We will examine these questions: I would take the second of your statements first, because it is a negative one.<a name=66:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You say, that no such language as that Christ suffered as a punishment for us occurs anywhere in the Bible.<a name=66:13></a> This connects itself with His bearing sin.<a name=66:14></a> But as to the fact: did you ever read <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#53">Isaiah  53</a>?<a name=66:15></a> Allow me to quote it: "He was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon him, and with his stripes we are healed.<a name=66:16></a> All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.<a name=66:17></a>"

		Another passage shews how unfounded your assertion is.<a name=68:12></a> In <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#3:13">Galatians  3:13</a>, it is written, "Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us; for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree.<a name=68:13></a>" <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#3:13">Galatians  3:13</a>.<a name=68:14></a> Were they man's curses that fell on the blessed Jesus on the cross?<a name=68:15></a> No: turn to <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#20:23">Deuteronomy  20:23</a>, and you will find that "he that is hanged is accursed of God," for the believer can say, "The Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#53:6">Isaiah  53:6</a>).<a name=68:16></a>

		Further, if you wish to see the connection of bearing sin in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#53:12">Isaiah  53:12</a> with the punishment due to it, you have only to compare <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#5:1">Leviticus  5:1</a>,17; chapter 17:16; chapter 20:19; chapter 24:15; <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#5:31">Numbers  5:31</a>; chapter 9:13; chapter 14:34; chapter 30:15; in all of which you will see it signifies coming under all the consequences of the sin committed, to be answerable for it before God.<a name=68:17></a> So it is spoken of particular sins, as idolatry, <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#14:33">Numbers  14:33</a>, <a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#23:35">Ezekiel  23:35</a>, and in this case clearly in its consequences on the people (so see <a href="../bible/Job.htm#34:31">Job  34:31</a>).<a name=68:18></a> Scripture does then speak most clearly of punishment for us; unless chastisement, stripes, a curse inflicted by God, be not punishment.<a name=68:19></a>

		The New Testament does not leave a shadow of doubt on the divine purpose of the passing shadows of the Old: the blood of bulls and of goats could not take away sin; but, instead thereof, Christ came, had a body prepared Him to do God's will: "by the which will we are sanctified, through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all" <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:10">Hebrews  10:10</a>.<a name=71:17></a> "Christ being come an high-priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building; neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.<a name=71:18></a> For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh; how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?<a name=71:19></a> And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance" <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#9:11">Hebrews  9:11</a>-15.<a name=71:20></a> Now here the doctrine of the Jewish sacrifices

		The apostle explains this largely in the following chapter, of which I have already quoted some principal verses.<a name=72:7></a> "This man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins, for ever sat down on the right hand of God" <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:12">Hebrews  10:12</a>, as it is said in the beginning of the epistle, "When he had by himself purged our sins" <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:3">Hebrews  1:3</a>.<a name=72:8></a>

		You say "Atonement always means in the Bible making two or more persons at one or agreed.<a name=78:17></a>" Does it?<a name=78:18></a> It is used once in the New Testament, where it really means "reconciliation.<a name=78:19></a>" We have received reconciliation with God through our Lord Jesus Christ (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:10">Romans  5:10</a>,11), where the apostle speaks of our being justified by His blood, and then saved from wrath, being thus also reconciled by Christ's death, and then saved by His life -- hence joying in God through Jesus, by whom we have received the reconciliation (that is, were brought back to God in peace).<a name=78:20></a> Here, while founded on justification by blood, and very different indeed from setting two persons at one (for it is bringing back a guilty sinner saved from wrath to God), still, if you had merely said, it ought to have been translated "reconciliation," no one could have complained; but you say, "always means in the Bible.<a name=78:21></a>" One is tempted to believe (to hope almost) you have scarcely ever read the Bible.<a name=78:22></a> Is it indeed so?<a name=78:23></a> The word used in Hebrew is <i>caphar</i> -- it is used ninety-eight times in the Old Testament.<a name=78:24></a> One has no reference to this matter.<a name=78:25></a> Of all the rest, perhaps one (though it has there much more the sense of propitiate) might be alleged to have such a sense, and that only by straining the expression: that is, <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#32:20">Genesis  32:20</a>, "I <i>will appease</i> him with the present .<a name=78:26></a>.<a name=78:27></a>.<a name=78:28></a> and afterward I will see his face, peradventure he will accept of me.<a name=78:29></a>" <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#32:20">Genesis  32:20</a>.<a name=78:30></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The habits of a vast number of Christians, and the moral atmosphere in which they are placed, have tended to produce very vague notions as to worship.<a name=87:1></a> Having turned away from formalism and superstitious views, which left the care of their religion to others, and feeling the need in which they stood of the truth, they have found in the recognition of the truth -- in hearing and owning it -- the sum total of their ordinary religious exercises.<a name=87:2></a> But surely this is not all that should be included in our religion while here below.<a name=87:3></a> In heaven, doubtless, the truth will be known in all its perfectness.<a name=87:4></a> Truth, now received into the heart, will be actually realized there in the presence of the glory of God, and of the Saviour, about whom the truth treats.<a name=87:5></a> There will be no longer any need of hearing the truth -- we shall live in it, and the power of it in our hearts will be expressed in adoration.<a name=87:6></a> Such is the characteristic of heaven.<a name=87:7></a> And, undoubtedly, this should be realized in some measure while on earth, by those who have received the truth, and who by it enjoy the knowledge of God who has communicated it, and of the Saviour who came to accomplish his work of love and of righteousness on our behalf; it should be realized by those who have received, not only the truth, but the very Spirit who gave the truth its place in their hearts, and who gives them the desire of glorifying Him whom it has revealed.<a name=87:8></a> When the Holy Spirit communicates heavenly truth to the renewed heart, it always re-ascends in thanksgiving and praise.<a name=87:9></a> True worship is but the grateful and joyful response of the heart to God, when filled with the deep sense of the blessings which have been communicated from on high.<a name=87:10></a> The Holy Spirit causes the feelings produced by the revelation of God -- of His glory -- of His love in Jesus, and of all the blessings with which He loadeth us, to re-ascend to God in adoration.<a name=87:11></a> And, surely, the heart which is penetrated with the grace of God, will find delight in rendering back to Him the homage of its adoration and gratitude for all these blessings, which are so many proofs of the infinite and eternal love which He has for us.<a name=87:12></a>

An innocent man might bless God for His goodness; but God Himself is now revealed in Christ, and for such worship as should rise to the height of this revelation to be rendered by a solitary being would suppose such a capacity in the worshipper as would put him almost upon a level with Him whom he adores. God would not be in the place proper to Him for worship; for who alone could glorify God suitably, if himself the sole object of His favour? Here the intervention of Christ is of great importance for the foundation of worship; because God is so glorified as that worship can be rendered to Him; and those who adore Him do so by virtue of that which He is for them in this intervention of Christ. The worship is based upon the fact that God is fully glorified; and we adore Him in acknowledging Him as thus glorified.

		First, it is evident that worship is the privilege only of the children of God.<a name=104:2></a> Being offered "in spirit and in truth" and being offered to Him who cannot admit sin into His presence, they, and they alone, who are washed in the blood of the Lamb, and who have received the Spirit, can draw near to God to adore Him.<a name=104:3></a> That a man who is not converted should render worship to God is simply impossible; for "without faith it is impossible to please God.<a name=104:4></a>" Such a one may be blessed in temporal things.<a name=104:5></a> He may, perhaps, ask such a blessing, and be heard.<a name=104:6></a> God may have tender compassion for him, as a poor sinner; but as yet he knows not God, as yet he has not the Spirit, as yet he is not washed in the blood of Christ; and therefore it is utterly impossible for him to worship God.<a name=104:7></a> That he thinks he can draw nigh to God is but the proof that he is ignorant of what he is in himself, and of what the God is whom he thinks to serve.<a name=104:8></a> Who can enter into the sanctuary, save he who is sanctified?<a name=104:9></a> Who can address himself to a father, as such, save as a child?<a name=104:10></a> Worship, moreover, being offered in the unity of the body of Christ, and by the Spirit who has formed this unity, and who dwells in the body as in a temple, he who is not of the body is necessarily excluded.<a name=104:11></a> To suppose that a person who has not the Spirit can be a member of this body is to deny its existence, its end, and its nature; for, if a man who is not converted can enter into the presence of God, and worship there, there is no need that there should be either a body in which God dwells as in a temple, nor is there need of redemption, which is the basis of everything.<a name=104:12></a> Why should there be a redeemed people, if the worldling can serve God in His presence?<a name=104:13></a> Wherefore adore God by the Spirit, if he who has not the Spirit can adore just as well?<a name=104:14></a> Worshipping in common supposes persons united in one body by the same Spirit, and that each can say, We, in sincerity, when addressing God.<a name=104:15></a> A hypocrite may be present; he will be a hindrance in the worship; but its validity will not

	<div class="paragraph">
		To render true worship to God supposes that a soul is set at liberty, and is free to draw near to God, in virtue of the efficacy of the work of Christ.<a name=105:3></a> If a person who loves God, and who has no other hope than the work of Christ, is timid in drawing near, it is right to encourage him; but if such a one has no real knowledge of the efficacy of the work of Christ, he will be ill at ease even in drawing near to God, because God's presence will communicate to him rather the conscience of sin, than of the joy which that presence inspires, to him who enjoys it in the peace which Christ confers.<a name=105:4></a> Nevertheless, in such cases of doubting and trembling, right affections often precede the being set free, and are more true to Christ than the reasoning of the mind; but this state of soul is not the normal state of worship.<a name=105:5></a> To be consciously in the presence of God, purified from all sin by the blood of Christ -- in the light as He is in the light -- such is the position of the true worshipper.<a name=105:6></a> This is the standing of the believer in Christ: and, in order to worship truly, this standing must be known and enjoyed.<a name=105:7></a> Sometimes bad teaching neutralizes this liberty, although the soul all the while, in its secret communings with God, cries, "Abba Father!<a name=105:8></a>" As a principle, however, whatever allowance be made by charity for these cases of ignorance, true worship supposes that we can draw near to God without fear.<a name=105:9></a> This freedom of access is a necessary and absolute effect of the complete and triumphant work of Christ, of which every true believer has the benefit; but it is the presence of the Spirit which enables us to realize it.<a name=105:10></a>

		These observations lead me to refer to a very important principle; namely, that the Holy Spirit is the energy, the sole living source, of all that takes place in worship so far as it is genuine.<a name=107:1></a> This principle, indeed, is true universally; it is true of all the exercises of spiritual life.<a name=107:2></a> We live by the Spirit.<a name=107:3></a> We walk by the Spirit.<a name=107:4></a> We worship in spirit and in truth.<a name=107:5></a> It is the Spirit who contends against the flesh.<a name=107:6></a> It is the affection of the Spirit which is the expression of the whole of the inward Christian life.<a name=107:7></a> But in Christian worship, the members of Christ being united together, the Spirit acts in the body.<a name=107:8></a> All that which is real and blessed comes from Him.<a name=107:9></a> Sovereign in action, but acting according to the spiritual capacity of each, He uses this sovereign power in order to express the feelings which are suitable to the assembly before God, to nourish and strengthen them by His grace.<a name=107:10></a> That which takes place ought to be according to the spiritual capacity of the assembly, raising it up, however, in the tone and spirit of worship, and leading it into the sensible enjoyment of the divine presence.<a name=107:11></a> It is thus that the Holy Spirit acts, for He acts in man, but according to the energy and grace of God.<a name=107:12></a> When Christians are thus met together as members of Christ's body, each acting in his place through the Spirit, the opportunity is presented for the exercise of the gifts of the members, which are for the edification of the body.<a name=107:13></a> I say, "of the body," because evangelization is necessarily addressed to the world.<a name=107:14></a> That is, an assembly which has worship for its primary object is the occasion, by its very nature, for the exercise of the gifts which tend to the edification of the body, although such exercise be in nowise the object proposed.<a name=107:15></a><a href="#107:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>

If these gifts are habitually used in such a way as to falsify the character of the assembly, and to deprive it of its true character of *worship, we* are always losers thereby. For if the Spirit of God, who acts, finds it meet to exhort and to teach the members of the body on such occasions, it still remains true, that to be able to adore God, without the need of being exhorted, is a more excellent condition of soul. One is, in this case, more simply and entirely engaged in communion with God -- in the enjoyment, by grace, of Himself.

		Reflection upon the truths we have been considering will shew the importance of the Lord's supper in worship, whether we view it in connection with the sacrifice offered to God, as the foundation of all our relationships with Him, or in connection with the affection and the devotedness of Christ for us -- the two themes which form the sphere of the spiritual affections that are exercised in worship.<a name=112:8></a> But there is another point also connected with it.<a name=112:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have seen that the Holy Spirit being the source, the power, and inspirer of all true Christian worship, the unity of the body formed by Him, and in which He acts, necessarily holds a prominent place in the worship which He produces in its members so united.<a name=112:10></a> Love, which is the soul of it, is defective in one of its most perfect forms, if conscience as to this unity is wanting.<a name=112:11></a> The presence of the Holy Spirit produces the consciousness of this unity, of which He is the author and the bond.<a name=112:12></a> Now, considered in one aspect, the Lord's supper is the expression of this unity.<a name=112:13></a> We are all but "one body; for we are all partakers of that one bread" (or, as in the original, "of that one loaf").<a name=112:14></a> If the bread broken represents, on the one hand, the broken body of Christ, the unity of the bread represents, on the other, the unity of His spiritual body.<a name=112:15></a> As the Spirit embraces all saints, so do the hearts of believers.<a name=112:16></a> Thus, "When I knew," said the apostle, "your love unto all saints.<a name=112:17></a>" And again, "That ye may comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height, and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge.<a name=112:18></a>" <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:18">Ephesians  3:18</a>,19.<a name=112:19></a>

		How sweet to find oneself united to "all saints," wherever they may be, in the unity of the body of Christ, as members together of that body, according to all the privileges which attach to it by reason of the love of Him who "nourishes and cherishes" it, as a man does his own flesh.<a name=113:1></a> How sweet to feel, through the Spirit, one's union with all that are Christ's, accompanied with the thought, so full of joy, that all those dear to us, as belonging to Him, are cherished by His constant love.<a name=113:2></a> Thus it is that intercession connects itself so intimately with worship, properly so-called, being inspired by the affections which are generated by the Holy Spirit.<a name=113:3></a> The petitions made by worshippers for grace for themselves are scarcely farther removed from worship, because the consciousness of what we owe to God, which is expressed in worship, necessarily produces the desire of glorifying Him, and of receiving the grace which alone can render us capable of doing so.<a name=113:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		With regard to the Supper, we find indeed that not only does it form the prominent feature of the religious exercises of believers, but that, with this end in view, they were wont to unite in the occasional and solemn assemblies.<a name=113:5></a> Thus, we read, "they continuing daily with one consent in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house [margin, at home]" -- that is, in their private houses, in contrast with the temple.<a name=113:6></a> Again, "They continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine, and in fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.<a name=113:7></a>" <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:42">Acts  2:42</a>.<a name=113:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It appears, then, that the early believers partook of the Supper even daily, and that, being still Jewish in many respects, they diligently frequented the temple; but then they had, in their houses, in remembrance of Christ, this special service, as to which He had said, "Do this in remembrance of me.<a name=113:9></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20">Acts  20</a>we read, "And upon the first day of the week [the resurrection-day], when the disciples came together to break bread.<a name=113:10></a>" This passage implies that this act, though others might accompany it, was the object of their meeting.<a name=113:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It has been supposed that "the breaking of bread" might apply to something besides the Supper, since there is proof that they made a meal at the same time.<a name=113:12></a> There is no doubt as to the meal.<a name=113:13></a> Christ instituted the Supper at the time of His own last evening's repast; and at first the disciples partook of a supper at the same time that they broke bread; but "the breaking of bread"

		These two great subjects about which Christian worship is occupied (namely, the love of God our Father, and the love of the Lord Jesus, in His work, and as Head of His body the Church) afford slight changes in the character of worship, according to the state of those who render it.<a name=115:18></a> At times the Lord Jesus will be more specially before the mind; at times thoughts of the Father will be more present.<a name=115:19></a> The Holy Spirit alone can guide us in this; but the truthfulness and spirituality of worship will depend upon the state of those who compose the assembly.<a name=115:20></a> Effort in such things has no place.<a name=115:21></a> He who is the channel of worship, let it be observed, should not present

	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another observation which the consideration of scripture would suggest, namely, how much the worship will be affected by all that grieves the Holy Spirit; every impediment, therefore, even in an individual, will make itself felt, if there be spirituality; for we are there as but "one body.<a name=116:4></a>" It is of the utmost importance that this delicacy of spiritual feeling should be cultivated and maintained, and that we should not habituate ourselves in worship to but little sense of the presence of God and of the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=116:5></a> If there is true spirituality, if the Holy Spirit fills the assembly with His presence, evil of every kind is quickly discovered.<a name=116:6></a> For God is a jealous God, and He is faithful.<a name=116:7></a> A single Achan was discovered at the commencement of the history of Israel -- a single lie in Ananias in the beginning of the Church's history.<a name=116:8></a> Alas!<a name=116:9></a> what things afterwards occurred in Israel!<a name=116:10></a> And what things afterwards took place in the Church, without anyone having even the consciousness that evil was present!<a name=116:11></a> May God make us humble, watchful, and true to Him, and enable us to bear in mind that His Spirit abides with us, in order that we may be able to render spiritual worship!<a name=116:12></a> It is by the Spirit's powerful testimony to the efficacy of the work of Christ, that we can abide in the presence of God, without blame and full of joy, and thus present to Him worship which is a witness before the angels of heaven to God's gracious and unfathomable love, and which presents to God Himself the most acceptable proof of the efficacy of that work which takes from us all fear in His presence, and which opens a channel, otherwise eternally closed, for the outflowing of that love in which He finds His delight.<a name=116:13></a>

		We may remark that the question here is not about sin, or the flesh, but of "confidence in the flesh" -- that is, about the religion of the flesh, which is altogether as evil as its lusts; for, after all, religiousness is but one of them, though covered with the veil of works and of holiness.<a name=119:1></a> The touchstone of the religion of the flesh is that it does not tend to the glory of Jesus, or that it does not glory only in Jesus.<a name=119:2></a> It can be much occupied in good works; it can be without reproach as to conduct; can have much of self-denial, much of piety, plenty of humility; can talk much of the love of God; but while pretending, perhaps, to found its services upon His love, it will be conversant rather with that love of God which is in our heart -- with our love to Him, and not with His love to us.<a name=119:3></a> It may be asked, "But if all these things can exist in a person, and be nothing but the religion of the flesh, how can we discern the true circumcision?<a name=119:4></a>" Scripture tells us: "it rejoices in Christ Jesus.<a name=119:5></a>" Nothing is easier than to judge as to these things, if Christ is our all.<a name=119:6></a> The fact that He is so makes us feel, without hesitancy, that all this religiousness is of the flesh, and yields its help to that which destroys Christianity from its foundations.<a name=119:7></a> Is another mark desired, by which one can judge of this religion of the flesh with all its pretensions?<a name=119:8></a> It does not hold the Head; that is, he who has confidence in these religious actings of the flesh never has the consciousness of his own union with Christ.<a name=119:9></a> He knows not what it is to be raised up together with Him and made to sit together with Him in the heavenly places.<a name=119:10></a> He knows not what it is to be a member of His body -- bone of His bone, and flesh of His flesh -- one spirit with the Lord.<a name=119:11></a> Such a one will, perhaps, recognize this as true for the Church, in an abstract manner (for the religion of the flesh can be orthodox), but he has not faith to recognize it as true of himself.<a name=119:12></a> Faith is an individual thing; and it places him who possesses it in the enjoyment of the object which it regards, or under its effects.<a name=119:13></a> <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2">Colossians  2</a>, as well as the chapter cited above, judges all the fair but specious appearance of fleshly religiousness.<a name=119:14></a> The Lord, in His addresses to the scribes and Pharisees, judged it in its grosser forms.<a name=119:15></a>

		Let us bear in mind also, that it will profit nothing to mingle carnal religion with that of the Spirit.<a name=120:8></a> The flesh of the Christian finds in such a course its aliment.<a name=120:9></a> The effort of the adversary, at the commencement of the Church, was, not to substitute the law and circumcision in the flesh, in place of Christ, but to add them.<a name=120:10></a> But the apostle saw clearly, by the Spirit, that were this admitted, all was lost.<a name=120:11></a> Make anything else an essential, and Christ shall profit you nothing.<a name=120:12></a> The Christian is one with the Head -- one with Christ; let in the least thing between them, and the body is a corpse.<a name=120:13></a> The work of Christ is not sufficient, if anything is to be added.<a name=120:14></a> And not only so, but thereby the Christian standing is completely swept away.<a name=120:15></a> For then, instead of being in Christ, happy in God's presence by virtue of a work already accomplished by the glorious Saviour alone; instead of being "complete in him," "accepted in the beloved," man has still to seek means of rendering himself acceptable to God; he has still to find a way by which he may present himself before Him.<a name=120:16></a> Under such circumstances, the word declares, "ye are fallen from grace.<a name=120:17></a>" The nature of Christianity is thereby

		DELIVERANCE FROM UNDER THE LAW, AS STATED IN THE HOLY SCRIPTURES
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In our relationship to God, there are two points of primary importance for us to remark: their responsibility as men, and the power of that life in which we live before Him.<a name=127:1></a> Both these were set forth to us by God in the garden of Eden, in the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and in the tree of life.<a name=127:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, as to our responsibility, man has become a sinner; consequently he has in him no spiritual life at all (<a href="../bible/John.htm#6:53">John  6:53</a>).<a name=127:3></a> Sin brought in death and condemnation.<a name=127:4></a> After the fall God gave the law by Moses in order to prove the state of man.<a name=127:5></a> The law of God must exact righteousness according to the nature of him to whom it is given; but the law does not give life (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#3:21">Galatians  3:21</a>).<a name=127:6></a> It is the very nature of the law to exact and not to give.<a name=127:7></a> Since it is the question of righteousness in man, God cannot lower the requirements of the law; and if we have the divine nature, we shall not desire its requirements to be lowered.<a name=127:8></a> The law is the measure of responsibility of the natural man, but it does not give life, and (because man is a sinner) the law, instead of being a resource, becomes the cause of death and condemnation.<a name=127:9></a> A mixture of law and grace, in so far as this last is found working in us, does not change this state.<a name=127:10></a> Grace does not destroy our responsibility, and that which the law requires is not fulfilled.<a name=127:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The history of Abraham is introduced in chapter 4.<a name=128:9></a> If the Jew found himself condemned by the law, he could fall back upon the relationship God had established between Himself and Abraham.<a name=128:10></a> It was to this end that the apostle set forth what were the foundations of this relationship, and shewed it was built upon faith and the promise.<a name=128:11></a> Righteousness was by faith, and it was given to Abraham before he was circumcised -- "Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness.<a name=128:12></a>" There is yet another principle taught us in this chapter.<a name=128:13></a> Abraham was as dead, as also was Sarah his wife.<a name=128:14></a> But God had promised to him a seed.<a name=128:15></a> Abraham did not doubt His word because of the impossibility to man of the thing, but he believed in the power of God, whose part it was to fulfil His own promise, and that was counted to him for righteousness.<a name=128:16></a>

		And so it is with us, only with this most remarkable difference: we do not believe that God is <i>able</i> to fulfil His promises, but that He has fulfilled them.<a name=128:17></a> "We believe in God who has raised up from the dead our Lord Jesus.<a name=128:18></a>" Observe, the apostle does not say here, We believe in Him who is raised, but in Him who <i>has</i> raised.<a name=128:19></a> It is thus that he teaches us the meaning of this doctrine.<a name=128:20></a> In the resurrection, God does not present Himself as the just Judge, satisfied as such by the work of Christ; but He acts according to His own power in the sphere of death's power, in bringing forth His beloved Son from under it, and bringing us now, in Christ, into a new position where death and sin are not.<a name=128:21></a> It is God who works for us, to save us perfectly, and to set us before Him in truth

		In chapter 5 he shews that the believer enjoys peace with God; that he lives in the sense of God's favour, being heir of His glory, and rejoicing even in tribulations, which work for his spiritual good.<a name=129:5></a> Much more, he rejoices in God Himself, who is his source of endless joy.<a name=129:6></a> As man, he <i>was</i> under the first Adam, and, as a necessary consequence, an inheritor of the consequences of his disobedience; the believer is in the Second Adam, through whose obedience he is righteous.<a name=129:7></a> But because he is righteous through the obedience of another (that is, even Christ's), the flesh says, No matter what I do -- I can do what I like.<a name=129:8></a> But I say, Thou hast already done enough; all thou hast done has been to destroy thyself; and thou acknowledgest, without being aware of it, that thy will is to sin.<a name=129:9></a> But let us go on with our subject.<a name=129:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle is not here speaking of the all-important motive which the believer finds in the blood of Christ to cause him to cease from sin, nor of the power which he finds in the love of God; but he shews that he cannot live in sin to which he is dead.<a name=129:11></a> The Christian partakes of the fruits of the obedience of Christ, because He is dead and risen.<a name=129:12></a> How can he live in sin, being already dead to sin?<a name=129:13></a> A dead man does not live.<a name=129:14></a> He is not a partaker of the blessing which is in Christ, if he has not the life of Christ.<a name=129:15></a> Though, as to the natural life, he is still living in the world, he ought nevertheless to reckon himself as dead to sin, since he lives by the life of Christ who is dead and risen.<a name=129:16></a>

		In chapter 7 he considers the consequences of the same truth as to the law.<a name=129:17></a> The law, he says, has dominion over a man so long as he lives; he then gives the tie of marriage as an explanation of it.<a name=129:18></a> As long as the first husband lives, the wife cannot be to another man without guilt.<a name=129:19></a> The first husband then represents the law, the second is Christ raised from the

		But, to return to the leading subject of the chapter, we see that we cannot be at the same time under the law and with Christ risen.<a name=130:11></a> This would be to have two husbands at once.<a name=130:12></a> In the second half of the chapter we are given the experience of one who wants to fulfil the righteousness of the law, and to bring forth fruit to God as standing under the law -- the first husband.<a name=130:13></a> Awakened by God, and under the influence of the new life, he understands the spirituality of the law; he understands its requirements; he desires to keep the law, and his conscience cannot be satisfied unless he does so.<a name=130:14></a> The new nature loves the righteousness of the law; but by reason of the opposition of the flesh it does not fulfil it (chapter 7:14,16,22).<a name=130:15></a> Sad state of a soul which, by reason of grace working in it, desires to do good; but because it is under the law, knows not how to do it!<a name=130:16></a> Now, let it be observed, that while in this state the soul is in its relationship with the first husband, and consequently has nothing to do with the Second.<a name=130:17></a> We have seen that no one can have two husbands at once: therefore in this passage there is no mention made either of Christ or of

		the Holy Spirit.<a name=131:1></a> It is the ordinary Christian experience of the spirituality of the law which we meet with.<a name=131:2></a> The conscience of the individual, being renewed, knows that it cannot fulfil the requirements of that spiritual law.<a name=131:3></a> The will renewed makes every possible effort to do so, but it cannot succeed.<a name=131:4></a> All the while it loves the spiritual nature of the law; it does not desire that it should be less perfect.<a name=131:5></a> It knows that God cannot give up His authority, nor lower His holiness.<a name=131:6></a> It tries with all its might to attain the end; but it has no power.<a name=131:7></a> The law demands perfect obedience; the conscience and the will assent; but the law gives no power: the end will never be attained.<a name=131:8></a> The awakening of the conscience in one who is sincere never produces in him the accomplishment of righteousness, but, on the contrary, despair.<a name=131:9></a> It is much more difficult to know and acknowledge that we cannot do a single good thing, than to know and acknowledge that we have sinned.<a name=131:10></a> The experience which the soul passes through under the law is a means of convincing it of its powerlessness; but holiness cannot be a subject of indifference, either to God or to the new-born soul; and as we find that we cannot work out righteousness, we are obliged to seek deliverance elsewhere.<a name=131:11></a> Yet, though God will convince a soul that is sincere of its powerlessness, He takes no pleasure in leaving it in this wretched state; but as soon as it acknowledges its state, and that it is, and knows itself to be, without any hope in itself, so that it can never attain to the righteousness of the law, then God reveals to it its perfect deliverance in Christ.<a name=131:12></a> Then at once the soul gives thanks to God for what He has done for it; it sees where its new place is in Christ risen -- its true husband, that it may bring forth fruit unto God (verse 24, 25).<a name=131:13></a> Henceforth, it is not only a new position (in Christ risen) which is its position, but also strength and liberty.<a name=131:14></a> The flesh is there still, its nature is not changed; but our position before God is in the Spirit and not in the flesh.<a name=131:15></a> The power of the Spirit is present livingly in us, so that we walk?<a name=131:16></a> not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.<a name=131:17></a> Christ in heaven is the expression of our true position before God.<a name=131:18></a> Christ living upon the earth is the representation and example of the heavenly man upon earth.<a name=131:19></a> Walking after the Spirit, we fulfil the law (by loving God and our neighbour) because we are not under the law.<a name=131:20></a>

		The power and the nature of the new life in Christ, who has died and is risen from the dead, is the answer of God's grace to the wickedness of the flesh.<a name=133:4></a> This is taught us in chapter 6.<a name=133:5></a> The soul set free, through fully knowing the work of God in Christ, is the answer of grace to the experiences of chapter 7.<a name=133:6></a> By considering attentively the first three verses of chapter 8 it will be easily seen that verse 1 corresponds to chapter 5, verse 2, to chapter 6, and verse 3 to chapter 7.<a name=133:7></a> Chapters 6 and 7 are closely connected, because the soul that is born again finds out the true character of the old man by means of the law.<a name=133:8></a> We have, then, the summing up of these two chapters in verses 2 and 3 of chapter 8.<a name=133:9></a> All hope of deliverance is shewn, in chapter 5, to flow out of justification.<a name=133:10></a> But this is not man's thought.<a name=133:11></a> He would wish to deliver himself actually from the law of sin by his own effort, and thus be without fault before God; but God will not have it so, and it never could be according to His truth, because that, on the one hand, the work of Christ would have been in vain, and, on the other, man would not have known what is the true nature and sinfulness of sin.<a name=133:12></a> If by efforts in the conscience we could find deliverance before God, the work of justification, though it might not be by strength of man, would at least be by the work of the Holy Spirit, and not by the work of Christ.<a name=133:13></a> But God will not; and for man it is impossible to have it so; because the work of the Spirit of God is to shew him how intolerable sin is to God, and that the nature of man is not changed.<a name=133:14></a> Now his very nature is sin.<a name=133:15></a> Man must submit himself to the righteousness of God.<a name=133:16></a> Convinced of sin, condemned by the law, he must find his righteousness in another -- in Christ, who died for him, and is now risen and in the presence of God.<a name=133:17></a> This is the reason why chapters 3 and 5 come before chapters 6 and 7, and verse 1 of chapter 8 before verses 2 and 3.<a name=133:18></a>

		Whilst we are upon this subject of the law, it ought to be remarked, before going farther, that there are some who make a law of Christ Himself.<a name=134:4></a> They acknowledge His love; they see in His work on the cross, how great is His love.<a name=134:5></a> They find in it a reason why they should love Christ perfectly, with their whole hearts; but they cannot find this love in themselves.<a name=134:6></a> They ought to love Christ with their whole heart, but they do not love Him thus.<a name=134:7></a> Now it is precisely the law which commands that we should love God with all our heart.<a name=134:8></a> We have found in Christ a new motive, we have perhaps given a new form to the law, but we find ourselves still under the law, though we have clothed it with the name of Christ.<a name=134:9></a> The power of sin is still there; it prevents us from fulfilling the law, which requires that we should love with the -- whole heart.<a name=134:10></a> Sin is in the flesh; it harasses me, and gets the better of me.<a name=134:11></a> Where can I look for deliverance from this terrible and skilful adversary?<a name=134:12></a> Our very helplessness is our resource.<a name=134:13></a> We find that God Himself must come in, because we can do nothing.<a name=134:14></a> No sooner have I understood the work of God (not the promises), than I find that God Himself has done the whole work.<a name=134:15></a> This is what is meant by verse 3: God Himself has met and conquered the evil which was always too much for me.<a name=134:16></a> Christ, who knew no sin, having been made sin for us, has taken away, not only the sins which we have actually committed, but also sin in the flesh, in the presence of God, because He died not only for sins, but also for sin.<a name=134:17></a>

		In this the love of God has been revealed to us, that Christ came into the world when we were nothing but sinners; but this revelation of His love does not purify the conscience.<a name=134:18></a> Moreover, so long as the conscience is not purified, the heart cannot rejoice in His love; because doubt in the conscience causes fear, and this prevents the heart from resting with confidence on His love.<a name=134:19></a> It is most true that love is in God;

		The Holy Spirit who speaks of love in the gospel, speaking by the same word is also light to convince of sin, and, this convincing, brings home to the heart not only sins committed but sin as in itself.<a name=135:2></a> A child may be convinced of his father's love, but he fears to meet him if his conscience tells him he has done anything wrong.<a name=135:3></a> "Fear hath torment.<a name=135:4></a>" But if we are risen with Christ, not only is it true that God has loved us in our state of sin, but He has also raised us up into quite a new position -- into the same position as Christ Himself is in before God, where we ourselves are the result of the mighty power of God, according to the power by which He raised up Christ from the dead, and set Him at His own right hand in the heavenly places (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:9">Ephesians  1:9</a>-23; <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5:5">2 Corinthians  5:5</a>).<a name=135:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The manifestation of the love of God in Christ whilst we were yet sinners is recalled to our attention in <a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:9">1 John  4:9</a>; but our perfect position in Christ, by being made partakers of His life, is set forth in verse 17 of the same chapter.<a name=135:6></a> Now Christ came into this position after having entirely finished His work -- a work by which the conscience is purified; and thus love is shed abroad without hindrance in the heart.<a name=135:7></a> Because I am united to Christ, who has died and is risen again for me, sin can no more be imputed to me than it can be imputed to Christ; His position before God is quite the same as mine, and (let us remember: it is a solemn thought!<a name=135:8></a>) to have any other would be nothing short of damnation.<a name=135:9></a> There is no middle place between the first and Second Adam; and we well know that Christ's position now before God is without sin, not only as to the perfection of His Person (which was always perfect), but besides as it regards the imputation of sin.<a name=135:10></a> What then?<a name=135:11></a> Has God become indifferent to sin?<a name=135:12></a> Did Christ do nothing as to it?<a name=135:13></a> Did He shrink back on account of the difficulty of the work?<a name=135:14></a> Did He claim at His Father's hand twelve legions of angels to deliver Him?<a name=135:15></a> or did He follow the counsel of the chief priests by saving Himself as He had so often saved others?<a name=135:16></a> No!<a name=135:17></a> we know it well; He is the Head, without sin, of those who believe on Him, because, as the One who has stood in their stead, He has made an end of sin upon the cross, and, having finished this work, He has united them to Himself by a new life which flows from Him, and by the power of the Holy Spirit which has made them one with Him.<a name=135:18></a> And now

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before this, though God sent the law among men, yet He Himself was hidden from them; but the same stroke which tore the veil, so that God was revealed in His holiness, has at the same moment taken away the sin which forbids our standing before His unveiled face.<a name=136:8></a> The full light (for the true light has now shined) which shines around us, and in which we are, shews that we are without sin before the face of God; and that our garments are washed in the blood of the Lamb.<a name=136:9></a> The nearer we are to the light, the more clearly will our perfect purity before God be seen.<a name=136:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is thus, then, that what the law could not do (because it condemned the sinner without being able to change the flesh) God has done, because Christ has not only borne our sins, but has come in the likeness of sinful flesh, and become the sacrifice for sin.<a name=136:11></a> Thus God <i>has condemned</i> sin in the flesh.<a name=136:12></a> Let this be particularly noticed.<a name=136:13></a> It is not said, Sin <i>shall be condemned</i>, as a thing that is yet to be done; neither is it by the power of the Holy Spirit, but it is by the atoning sacrifice of Christ.<a name=136:14></a>

		Now, as regards holiness, what is the effect of this truth?<a name=137:1></a> What have we to say of the position of the believer?<a name=137:2></a> He is set in the light, even before the face of God.<a name=137:3></a> He has a life which rejoices in this light; he has the Holy Spirit to enjoy it.<a name=137:4></a> Holiness is measured by this light.<a name=137:5></a> Since we are in the presence of God, all things shall be judged according to the perfection of His presence.<a name=137:6></a> "We have communion with the Father and with His Son.<a name=137:7></a>" Therefore, when the apostle speaks of sin in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3:23">Romans  3:23</a>, he does not say, "We have sinned, and we come short of what men ought to do," but we "come short of the glory of God.<a name=137:8></a>" And because we are on the ground of grace, it is not merely that holiness is <i>expected</i> from us, but we are made partakers of <i>His</i> holiness.<a name=137:9></a> And not only so, but because God is for us, we find power to realize in our life this setting apart to Him; and because we know He is for us, we have the assurance that He will give us this power when we draw near to Him.<a name=137:10></a> Holiness is realized by communion with God; but with the conscience of sin, communion is impossible.<a name=137:11></a> Where shall we find strength for practical separation to God, unless in God Himself?<a name=137:12></a> How can we ourselves walk in this practical holiness if we have not His strength?<a name=137:13></a> How can I seek this strength from God if I have not the assurance that He is for me, and if my conscience prevents me from approaching Him?<a name=137:14></a> Efforts made after holiness may be sincere before the soul is set at liberty, because the tendencies of the new life are there; but such efforts are always mixed up with the felt need of justification, and thus the true nature of holiness is overthrown and lost, or, rather, it has never been known.<a name=137:15></a>

		<h3>PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION</h3>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The numbers of the "Bible Treasury" containing the papers on "The Sufferings of Christ," having been widely sought after, are out of print, and not to be had.<a name=139:1></a> Recently, an attack has been made on the doctrine contained in them, and in other articles to which I will just now refer.<a name=139:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The real character of that attack is such that I do not feel it possible to take the smallest notice of it.<a name=139:3></a> It seemed to me the best reply to it was to publish the articles incriminated in it.<a name=139:4></a> The reader will find them here exactly as they were originally published, with the exception of the correction of errors of the press.<a name=139:5></a> I might, I dare say, have made some passages clearer; but it is evident that, under the circumstances in which their publication comes before the reader, my only path was to publish all exactly as it had already appeared.<a name=139:6></a> It seems to me that, as it stands, it is quite sufficiently clear to any upright mind.<a name=139:7></a> I am not so foolish as to think that all the expressions in it are the best, or absolutely exact or just, as if I were inspired; but what is taught (taught I think sufficiently clearly for any one willing to learn) I believe to be the truth, and hold and maintain as the truth now.<a name=139:8></a> To the humblest and weakest of God's saints I should gladly explain my meaning, and should be bound to do so.<a name=139:9></a> Here it would be out of place.<a name=139:10></a> I have only to beg them to take my doctrine from my own papers.<a name=139:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Two main subjects are involved in the attacks made: the sufferings of Christ in Gethsemane; and Christ's laying down His life.<a name=139:12></a> In both I maintain fully the doctrine I have taught in these papers, and I think what is opposed to it is ignorance or fatal error.<a name=139:13></a> The first -- the connection of Christ's sufferings with the state of the remnant of Israel in the last days -- I do not expect those not versed in scripture to enter into; and I would add, that (though this is enlarged upon in an addition to the original article, because enquiries were made as to it) I have no wish to turn aside any one's mind from the deep intrinsic preciousness of the sufferings of Gethsemane to their application to that particular subject, as I think the original article may shew.<a name=139:14></a> It was enlarged on because enquiry was

		As regards the second point, I not only think that the doctrine taught in the "Girdle of Truth" is sound, but I think it one of the most important truths possible at the present time (one which in the present confused state of Christendom lies at the root of blessing), and am thankful that the present attack will spread it more and more.<a name=140:3></a> I republish, therefore, from the "Girdle of Truth" the article which has given occasion to the attack.<a name=140:4></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#167:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>This passage has been used against me, not for what is in it, but as shewing the evil of other passages. The principle is perfectly just Positive *direct suffering* from God is for sin, from man for righteousness But that cannot set aside the sorrows of Christ's heart in respect of Israel's rejection, and His own cutting off as Messiah. It does not set aside that He felt what death was, that it became God to make the Captain of our salvation perfect through sufferings. This is not, in the true sense of the word, suffering from God in that sense of wrath of which @Psalm 22 speaks. What is here is right. The utmost that can be said is, that a collateral truth should have been mentioned, as it was m my answer to Mr. Newton, where I said there were only these two sorts of suffering. Directly and properly that is true. My accusers may add the collateral truth if they please. Moreover Christ piously ascribed all these sufferings to God even when they were instrumentally fro n man, as coming from God's will and counsel. The reader has only to go on to the third following paragraph and he will find these other sufferings. Compare pages 178-180. It is fully entered on towards the close.

		The principle of these two kinds of suffering, however, as contrasted with suffering for sin or evil, is the same.<a name=168:5></a> The difference of suffering for good and for evil is touchingly contrasted in Peter's epistle, while both are attributed to Christ; and we are warned against the latter.<a name=168:6></a> Christ is presented as suffering as an example, chapter 2: 19-23, where we see, in verse 23, he refers to the revilings and violence of men; in verse 24, he adds His bearing our sins, shewing that it is in order that we may be dead to it, not suffer for that.<a name=168:7></a> But this is brought out, as I said, touchingly, chapter 3: 17, 18, the force of which I take to be this: the apostle had been speaking of suffering for righteousness, and adds, It is better, if it be God's will, that you suffer for well doing than for evil doing; for, he adds, Christ has suffered once for sins.<a name=168:8></a> That is, this is not your part in suffering; He has done this once for all.<a name=168:9></a> Suffering for righteousness may be your happy portion; suffering for sin is, as regards the Christian, Christ's part alone.<a name=168:10></a>

		I would notice two other characters of suffering in our blessed Lord.<a name=168:11></a> In the first place, His heart of love must have suffered greatly from the unbelief of unhappy man, and from His rejection by the people.<a name=168:12></a> We read of His sighing in opening the deaf ears and loosing the tied tongue (<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#7:34">Mark  7:34</a>); and on the Pharisees asking a sign (chapter 8: 12), of His sighing deeply in spirit.<a name=168:13></a> So, indeed, in <a href="../bible/John.htm#11">John  11</a>at the tomb of Lazarus, He wept and groaned within Himself at seeing the power of death over the spirits of men, and their incapacity to deliver themselves; and as He wept also over Jerusalem, when He saw the beloved city just going to reject Him in the day of its visitation.<a name=168:14></a> All this was the suffering of perfect love, moving through a scene of ruin, in which self-will and heartlessness shut every avenue against this love which was so earnestly working in its midst.<a name=168:15></a> It must have been -- with bright and blessed moments where its exercise proved sweetness to itself, and led His heart out by times to fields white for harvest -- a constant source of sorrow.<a name=168:16></a> This sorrow (blessed be God)

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A weight of another character pressed upon the Lord, I doubt not, often through His life; and must and ought to have done so, though only shewing perfectness (that is, in blessed submission to the divine will).<a name=169:3></a> I mean the anticipation, when the time was there for Him to look at it (how often are we distracted by our little anticipated sorrows!<a name=169:4></a>), of His sufferings on the cross and their true and pressing character.<a name=169:5></a> On His path of life death lay.<a name=169:6></a> He could not, as we see, take His part with the excellent of the earth, and bring them into the purposed, or indeed, any real and permanent blessing, without going through death, and death as the wages of sin, for they were sinners.<a name=169:7></a> If the corn of wheat did not fall into the ground and die, it abode alone.<a name=169:8></a> There none could follow -- not indeed the disciples, as He tells them, more than the Jews.<a name=169:9></a> And for Him death was death.<a name=169:10></a> Man's utter weakness, Satan's extreme power, and God's just vengeance, and alone, without one sympathy, forsaken of those whom He had cherished, the rest His enemies, Messiah delivered to Gentiles and cast down, the judge washing his hands of condemning innocence, the priests interceding against the guiltless instead of for the guilty -- all dark, without one ray of light even from God.<a name=169:11></a> Here perfect obedience was needed, and (blessed be God!<a name=169:12></a>) was found.<a name=169:13></a> But we can understand, and just in the measure of Christ's divine, while human, sensibilities, what such sorrow must have been in prospect for a soul who looked at it with the feelings of a man made perfect in thought and apprehension by the divine light which was in Him.<a name=169:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We have examples of these sorrows of the Lord's heart in two remarkable cases, which, of course, though none were like the last, do not at all exclude the thought that others may have been, nor give full light on what He may have felt when in perfect calmness He spoke of His future sufferings to His disciples.<a name=169:15></a> The cases I refer to are those of <a href="../bible/John.htm#12">John  12</a>and Gethsemane.<a name=169:16></a> In the former we read, "Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say?<a name=169:17></a> Father, save me from this hour.<a name=169:18></a>" <a href="../bible/John.htm#12:27">John  12:27</a>.<a name=169:19></a> The coming up of the Gentiles had opened out before Him the scene of the rejected Christ passing into the wider glory of the Son of man; but then the corn of wheat must fall into the ground and die.<a name=169:20></a> This brings before His soul the true and necessary path of His glory -- death, and all it meant,

		So in Gethsemane, when it was yet nearer, and the prince of this world came, and His soul was exceeding sorrowful unto death; when the cup was just as it were being brought to Him, though He had not yet taken it (for He would take it from none but from His Father's hand), when His will was that He should drink it, because it was not possible it could be otherwise, if the purpose and word of God was to be accomplished -- there this character of sorrow and trial, or temptation, reached its fulness.<a name=170:5></a> The tempter (who on His entrance on His public service, and to hinder His doing so, had tempted Him with what was agreeable to the flesh in the wilderness and on the pinnacle of the temple, and had been baffled and bound, and during the Lord's life had his goods spoiled) now returns to try Him with all that was dreadful for the soul of man, and, above all, for the Lord, if He persevered in His obedience and work unto the end.<a name=170:6></a> Power had been displayed capable of delivering living man from all the dominion of the enemy.<a name=170:7></a> Another awful, dreadful truth had now come out: <i>man would not</i> have the Deliverer.<a name=170:8></a> If the Lord was to persevere in interesting Himself in the wretched race, He must be, not a mighty living Deliverer by power, but a dying Redeemer.<a name=170:9></a> It was the path of obedience and the path of love.<a name=170:10></a> "The prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me; but that the world may know that I love the Father, and as my Father has given me commandment so I do.<a name=170:11></a>" <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:30">John  14:30</a>,31.<a name=170:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But in both the cases we are now considering, we find Him still with His Father, though occupied with Him about the cup He had to drink, and His obedience only shining out in its perfection.<a name=170:13></a> There was no forsaking of God yet, though there was dealing with His Father about that cup which was characterized by His being forsaken of God.<a name=170:14></a> "Father, save me from this hour.<a name=170:15></a> But for this cause came I unto this hour.<a name=170:16></a> Father, glorify thy name.<a name=170:17></a>" Here He gets the answer, to obedience to death in judgment, of real and complete victory, and the widespread opening out of the revelation of love, though the world was judged therein.<a name=170:18></a> But in Gethsemane all was closing in.<a name=170:19></a> It was the power of darkness and the deeper agony of the Lord told itself out in few (yet how mighty) words, and sweat as it

		I am not unapprized, though happily living out of the reach of most of the religious warfare that is abroad in England, that an attack has been made, without naming them, on persons alleged to hold certain views as to the sufferings of Christ, and that they are declared to be semi-Socinians.<a name=174:4></a> I do not think that such an attack deserves an answer -- at any rate it does not burden me much; and I do not feel disposed to mix up questions that relate to the sufferings of Christ with so small a matter as personal attacks of the kind.<a name=174:5></a> The Wesleyans (whatever the correctness of their views on other points may be) would be surprised to find themselves to be semi-Socinians for such a phrase as this in Bunting's sermon on justification by faith, which I happen to have lying before me: "It is only as a Lamb slain that He takes away our sins.<a name=174:6></a>" Indeed, the errors, which are said to be renewed and declared to be evil in the passage quoted by the accuser, are blamed because they divide the orthodox.<a name=174:7></a> Do they count semi-Socinianism orthodox?<a name=174:8></a> But enough and too much.<a name=174:9></a>

		Multitudes of saints, with perhaps undefined apprehensions of the manner of the application of the sufferings of the blessed Lord to their profit, look at all the sufferings of Christ with an adoring feeling of their infinite value, and believe that all are for themselves, undergone, in love to them, and the means of their blessing.<a name=174:10></a> I can only pray God that this feeling may be deepened in them and in myself too.<a name=174:11></a> I do not believe one sorrow was wanting to Christ, nor one sigh of His which had not infinite value, nor which is not precious for me, and (blessed be God!<a name=174:12></a>) a part of my blessing.<a name=174:13></a> He has given <i>Himself</i> for us, and this was a part of that giving, or the fruit of it.<a name=174:14></a> We cannot feel it too deeply.<a name=174:15></a> The true question lies beyond all this, and

		We cannot have too deep a sense of the depth of the Lord's suffering in His atoning work, of that which no human word is competent to express (for in human language we express but our own feelings) -- what the Lord's drinking the cup of divine wrath was to Him.<a name=178:5></a> With this nothing can be mingled and mixed up.<a name=178:6></a> Divine wrath against sin, really felt and truly felt in the soul of One who, by His perfect holiness and love to God and sense of God's love in its infinite value, could know what divine wrath was, and what it was to be made sin before God, of One too who was by virtue of His Person, able to sustain it, stands wholly apart and alone.<a name=178:7></a> Dreadful as the anticipation of it must have been, as it surely was, it was not that which was anticipated.<a name=178:8></a> No simple fact of death, dreadful as it was to the Prince of life, still less any human suffering, real and absolute as His were (and without one eye to pity, one heart to feel with the sufferer), could be put on a level with divine wrath.<a name=178:9></a>

		Hence, in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22">Psalm  22</a>, the Lord expresses it Himself alone; He refers to the violence and wickedness of man in that Psalm; He refers to His own sense of weakness; and, in the midst of all that, contrasts with it God's being far from Him, as the distinct point of conflict in it, but openly declares that in all sorrow where others had help, God had forsaken Him.<a name=178:10></a> Hence, as has been said elsewhere, the fruit of this is unmingled grace, and grace and blessing alone, because it was wrath and suffering from God for sin.<a name=178:11></a> Sorrows from man's hand might and will bring judgment, if viewed as the fruit of enmity of will; the forsaking of God when Christ is made sin -- who is to be judged for that?<a name=178:12></a> No, this stands absolutely and wholly alone, and

It refers on the face of it to the sufferings of Christ because others were in that condition; or Christ would be a sinner under condemnation, and a saint through grace, and He learning when a sinner the difference of good and evil. The last kind of suffering is immediately guarded, only because there was the possibility of misconception. People have confounded His going through the sufferings in His own soul, and being in the state or relationship which occasioned them. He did pass through such sufferings in His spirit; but it was because they belonged to others who were in the state which brought them on, and that He passed through that which makes Him to enter into such. Thus He was upright, feared death and wrath, cried to God with them before Him. What is spoken of is the kind of sufferings, and Jesus spirit realizing them. If any prefer "realized in His own soul," I have no objection; only Messiah was really cut off. It is what was meant by passing through them, as is evident on the face of the sentence. The whole matter is explained in the introduction.

		But in the case of the remnant of Israel in the latter days, we find these exercises of heart and spirit gone through in circumstances where the government of God is historically developed as to a people sinful under law, yet renewed and quickened of God, so that the desires and consciousness of uprightness are there.<a name=194:3></a> The circumstances are, with more complete development, the continuation of those in which the Jews were in the time of our Lord: only that Antichrist is manifested, the body of the people are given up to unbelief and the unbridled influence of Satan -- seven devils, worse than the old spirit of idolatry, but along with it, are entered into them.<a name=194:4></a> In a word, it is the time of Satan's power, the power of darkness, of the oppression of the Gentiles, of the same Roman beast.<a name=194:5></a> In the midst of this the remnant find themselves, on the one side, conscious of the nation's guilt under the law, and of their filling up of their sins, so that wrath was come upon them, the just vengeance of God; yet they feel this because they are renewed and quickened; and the Jehovah they have sinned against is their only hope.<a name=194:6></a> Yet how difficult to trust God for help in difficulties in which we find ourselves under His hand by our sinning against Him!<a name=194:7></a> Without atonement, they could not be dealt with in grace.<a name=194:8></a> The goat of atonement had been offered, so that God could deal with them about their sins for their good, sustain their faith, yet make them feel the weight of their sins, and the darkness they had brought themselves into; and, at the same time, say, "Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh in darkness and seeth no light?<a name=194:9></a> let him trust in the name of Jehovah, and stay himself on his God.<a name=194:10></a>" But the true Aaron had not come forth, so that Israel's sins should be, in administrative application, sent away on the scape-goat into the land not inhabited.<a name=194:11></a>

No one can be answerable but the *editor* of the Dublin tracts for expressions found in them, because he modifies them to suit his object, which is popular distribution, and he seeks to make them simple and clear; but the critic's note is most unhappy. The tract states that God was with Christ in the communion of perfect complacency up to the time His people's sins were transferred to Him on the cross, but that then all was changed. The critic then exclaims, "What! the *Father's complacency* in His Son changed!" Such singular pre-occupation hardly needs, as everyone will feel, an answer. The tract says there was *the communion* of perfect complacency till then; the note says, "What! the complacency changed!" Now I believe that there never was a time when the Father's complacency in the Son was so great as at that solemn moment; but that is not *the communion* of complacency. "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" is not the enjoyment of communion. The subject precludes my making any remark on so strange a mistake.

		<a class="footnote" name="#206:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>It may be alleged this is not the case in Scotland. But their Confession was a hundred and thirty years after the Reformation; and even there it is really taught as to the elect. "Grace and salvation are not so inseparably annexed," they say, "that all that are baptized are undoubtedly regenerate"; but this is to save election. They say, "The efficacy of baptism is not tied to that moment of time wherein it is administered; yet, notwithstanding, by the right use of this ordinance, the grace promised is not only offered, but really exhibited and *conferred by the Holy Ghost* to such, whether of age or infants, as that grace belongeth unto, according to the counsels of God's own will, in His appointed time." So that, according to this teaching, by the right use of this ordinance, the grace promised is conferred by the Holy Ghost in God's appointed time. Yet this is the efficacy of baptism. The grace promised is not conferred in baptism; yet, by the right use of this ordinance, in which it is not conferred, it is conferred at some other time by the Holy Ghost. And yet it is the efficacy of baptism. This is a singular effort to reconcile the truth felt as to vital partaking of the divine nature, and tradition as to ordinances.<p>Here is the Catechism of Calvin: "Baptism is to us as an entrance into the Church of God; for it testifies to us that God, whereas we were strangers to Him (estrangiers de luy), receives us for His servants. The signification of baptism has two parts; for the Lord represents to us in it the remission of our sins, and, besides, our regeneration or spiritual renewal. Not that the water is the washing of our souls, for that belongs to the blood of Christ only, but by the sacrament that is signified to us. The water is in such sort a figure that the truth (reality) is found with it; for God promises nothing to us in vain; wherefore it is certain that in baptism the remission of sins is offered to us and we receive it. This grace is not accomplished indifferently in all; for many destroy it by their perversity. Nevertheless, this does not hinder the sacrament having such a nature, although it is the faithful only who experience its efficacy. This grace is applied to us in baptism, inasmuch as we are then clothed with Jesus Christ, and receive then His Spirit, provided we do not render ourselves unworthy of the promises which are then given to us." An explanation, though happily less precise than the Westminster or Scottish, equally unintelligible to me, I avow. We receive His Spirit, provided we do not render ourselves unworthy of the promises given in it. Render ourselves -- when? Do we then receive it or not? <p>The Catechism of Heidelberg, in general use among the Reformers, says, "Why does the Holy Spirit call baptism the washing of regeneration and the cleansing of sins? To teach us, not only that, as the filth of the body is cleansed by the water, so our sins are effaced by the blood and by the Spirit of Christ; but much more to assure us by this sign and by this divine pledge that we are not less interiorly purged of our sins than we are washed outwardly with the visible water." <p>I need hardly cite less important witnesses of what I allege. The lesser catechism of Luther thus states it: <p>"What does baptism exhibit (praestat) or confer? <p>"It works the forgiveness of sins, frees from death and from the devil, and gives eternal blessedness to all and every who believe what the words and divine promises promise. <p>"How can water effect so great things? <p>"Water certainly does not effect such great things, but the word of God which is in and with the water, and faith which believes in the word of God added to the water: because water without the word of God is simply water, and is not baptism; but, the word of God being added, it is baptism, that is, the saving water of grace and life, and the laver of regeneration in the Holy Ghost; as Paul says in @Titus 3 (quoted)."What this faith is I may cite from the greater catechism, which is a violent defence of his views." These leaders of the blind (who said faith alone saved and that externals were of no avail) will not see that faith must necessarily have something which it may believe, that is, on which it rests, and supported by which it endures. Thus now faith clings to the water (aquae adhaeret) and believes that it is baptism in which pure blessedness and life is, not by virtue of the water (as has been abundantly said), but through this, that baptism is united with and confirmed by the word and the divine ordinance, and ennobled by His name." He founds it all on "He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved." <p>The Dutch services teach the doctrine of regeneration by baptism as clearly as possible. See the second point in the address at the beginning of the formulary and the thanksgiving at the end. It is asserted in these places without any question or condition. <p>Calvin is far less positive in his Institutions, with a great deal that is confused, and in my judgment erroneous, as to the identity of the baptism and ministry of John with that of the apostles. He says that the knowledge and certainty of purging and regeneration are given in it. Purification is promised by baptism, but none other than that which is by the blood of Christ, which is figured by water by reason of its power to cleanse. But for sins committed afterwards, we are to look back to the certainty given us in baptism, which is not only for past sins, for the purity of Christ is offered to us. That always flourishes -- is undone (opprimitur) by no spots. He says, "Therefore it is *thus* to be judged; namely, that in whatever time we may be baptized, we are washed and purged once for our whole life," and hence, if we fail, are to recall our baptism. We know how earnestly Luther preached justification by faith -- how Calvin taught it -- how English martyrs laid down their lives for it; yet all in their catechisms taught that forgiveness was received by baptism, so that men were to look back to it if they fell afterwards. I had often remarked the contradiction in the two aspects of the Reformation in England; so that I could not understand how a man could sign his acceptance of both. If he believed the Articles, he denied the Prayer-book which he usually signed (this was the evangelical position). If he believed the Prayer-book, he denied the Articles, or signed them with a reserve; he had his own explanation, as the other had for the catechism and baptismal service. <p>What I now notice it for is, that this remark applies to the whole Reformation. The preachers of truth proclaim justification by faith. The same men, when they form national Christianity, teach it to be identified with ordinances. The phenomenon attaches itself to the whole circle of the Reformation. The more the formative side is clung to, the more they approach Rome in giving life and salvation by ordinances. The more they seek souls in grace, the more they depart from it. I am satisfied that a great deal of this arose from confounding the Church as the body of Christ, and the house formed on earth with the responsibilities of the Church of God attached to it, but having quite a different aspect from that of the body of Christ. Then baptism was made to be incorporation in the body of Christ, which the scripture never speaks at all of its being -- on the contrary, declares that by *one Spirit* we are baptized into one body -- a baptism which is never for a moment in scripture confounded with that of water. On these points, the Reformers clearly have not scripture to warrant their statements. Nor are they alone in this. The language of the English baptismal service and catechism is too plain to need comment. "We yield thee hearty thanks, most merciful Father, that it hath pleased thee to regenerate this infant with thy Holy Spirit, to receive him for thine own child by adoption and to incorporate him into thy holy Church." "We call upon thee for this infant, that he, coming to thy baptism, may receive remission of his sin by spiritual regeneration." And the catechism, "My godfathers and godmothers in my baptism, wherein I was made a member of Christ, the child of God, and an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven." And in the service for Confirmation, "hast vouchsafed to regenerate these thy servants by water and the Holy Ghost, and hast given unto them forgiveness of all their sins." On this last point I will quote a passage of the Homilies, to shew the deliberate view of doctrine as to a sacrament, which governed the minds of the Reformers in England. "And as for the number of them, if they should be considered according to the exact signification of a sacrament, namely, for the visible sign expressly commanded in the New Testament, whereunto is annexed the promise of free forgiveness of our sin, and of our holiness and joining in Christ; there be but two, namely, baptism and the supper of the Lord." "For although absolution hath the promise of forgiveness of sin; yet by the express word of the New Testament, it hath not this promise annexed and tied to the visible sign, which is imposition of hands. And though the ordering of ministers hath this visible sign and promise, yet it lacks the promise of remission of sin," etc. This is precise enough. Nothing is a sacrament which has not remission of sin annexed and tied to the visible sign. I quote all these, not for the purpose of controversy, but of demonstrating what the doctrine of the teachers of the Reformation was as to sacraments, and particularly baptism. It does not weaken my value for their work, but it does affect their authority as a standard of doctrine.

		The mistake of your correspondent -- and I am very glad of his jealousy of anything which could have in it a particle of the doctrine that has been and is spread abroad -- is, that he confounds sorrows with the cause of sorrows.<a name=218:12></a> First of all, to dispose at once of his first question, "Was He Himself chastened in respect of sin?<a name=218:13></a>" It scarcely needs an answer, because He had no sin, in respect of which He had to be chastened.<a name=218:14></a> He was not chastened in respect of sin, nor by anger applying to His Person in respect of sin.<a name=218:15></a> But we must not confound voluntary sympathy with sorrows, and entering into them in love, with lying under sorrow by His own position.<a name=218:16></a> If He lay under the chastening Himself, He could not enter into it in voluntary love, alive as a man on earth, because in that case He was under it already Himself.<a name=218:17></a> Here is just the danger -- denying the entering into, because of the fatal doctrine of His being necessarily under.<a name=218:18></a> It is just the doctrine of Christ's being necessarily and by birth, when a man, under these sorrows and chastenings for sin, which renders impossible the truth of His graciously and freely entering into them in <i>love</i>; which is just what gives all its value to these sufferings.<a name=218:19></a> He could not, as a man on earth, enter in grace and tender goodness

		This point is cleared therefore.<a name=219:2></a> But sufferings endured by others can be fully entered into and endured by the will and love of an individual, which they are not in the smallest degree subject necessarily to, and could cease to undergo, at any moment, if they thought fit.<a name=219:3></a> A mother could enter into prison with a child, and suffer the disagreeableness and discomfort of the prison in love to her child, and to win his heart to what is right, to whom it was no penalty for a fault, and from which she was free to go out at any moment, if she were disposed.<a name=219:4></a> She may enter into all his circumstances, and endure the pain and misery of a prison life, and feel that it is, for him, a penalty for his faults, without the smallest sense, whatever, of its being a penalty on herself -- as indeed it is not.<a name=219:5></a> She is gone there in love.<a name=219:6></a> It is no penalty.<a name=219:7></a> She is not there, at any time, as in a penal condition herself, nor can she have the sense of its being a penalty on her, as if she were in the same case as her son.<a name=219:8></a> Yet, in fact, she is enduring all he is, feels it much more herself (for her natural and moral feelings are much more delicate), and she feels all the shame and misery of it as a penalty <i>on him</i>, without its being in the smallest degree such on her.<a name=219:9></a> Not only so, if she were there by the law imposing it on her (even because she was the mother of him who had incurred it), she could not feel in the same way for him.<a name=219:10></a> Instead of our being under an evil being a cause of sympathy -- so far as we are under it ourselves, we cannot in simple and true love sympathize with one who is.<a name=219:11></a> We must morally be out of the evil to feel freely for those in it.<a name=219:12></a> The sufferings <i>as to the facts</i> were experimentally the Lord's own, and He entered in spirit and thought for His people into the causes of them, and did so, and could do so, exactly, because the causes of them had no application whatever to Himself.<a name=219:13></a> The scorn and rejection of the Gentiles He underwent; so will the remnant of Israel; but they have been the guilty parties, and are there because they are, though now in heart repentant, and turned away from them.<a name=219:14></a> The terror of God's judgment was before Christ in Gethsemane: so it will be with the remnant of Israel in the last day.<a name=219:15></a> They will indeed escape it (which He did not, because of our salvation).<a name=219:16></a> Rejection and scorn on the part of the Jews were His portion; so it will be of the remnant.<a name=219:17></a> And thus with all this

		I believe, on the contrary, that though suffering from man and feeling for all the sufferings of man and Israel, and the sorrow of love resting continually upon His heart, the sunshine of God's favour was on Him and was His delight and His joy continually, and thus there was no divine displeasure resting on that Holy One, nor was His frame wasted by the anguish of it.<a name=221:17></a> I detest it as a false abomination.<a name=221:18></a> But I believe that in grace, at the close of His history, when His life-work, as presented to Israel according to promise and gracious service towards man, was brought to a close, He, the object of divine favour, entered into the sorrows of His people.<a name=221:19></a>

		But my object now is not to pursue these thoughts farther, but to say that when the humblest saint is honestly exercised on the subject, or troubled by any statements which it cannot clear up for itself, I am bound and ready to explain, and make the truth, or my own meaning, clear as far as I can.<a name=223:6></a> I suppose the replies I have made to your correspondents, C.<a name=223:7></a> and another from Manchester, will serve as a general reply to any honest difficulty; but as more than one request for explanation has reached me, I would meet the particular points contained in some of these and clear up what may have been obscurely expressed in my own statements on the subject.<a name=223:8></a> The Psalms afforded more especially occasion to that part of the subject which remains obscure to many.<a name=223:9></a> This is not surprising.<a name=223:10></a> The subject is new to most, and the bearing of particular psalms or parts of psalms in many cases new to my own mind; so that, though perfectly clear as to what I reject and what I hold, it is not surprising if I have not made all clear to my readers.<a name=223:11></a> Something doubtless is my own fault, but much of it the newness of the subject to themselves.<a name=223:12></a>

		Indeed one of the objects of the papers was to shew that Christ's suffering from God was a distinct thing, even if at the same time, from His suffering from man -- that the former brought grace and redemption to man, the latter, judgments; and that this distinction was carefully kept up in the Psalms.<a name=224:1></a> In one place it is said, in the preceding articles, that He was smitten of God.<a name=224:2></a> This, however, is the language of the psalm, and my remark is introduced in connection with it, though the question may remain how far it applied to Christ, how far to the remnant.<a name=224:3></a> No one, I suppose, at least no believer, has ever doubted the general application of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#69">Psalm  69</a>to Christ.<a name=224:4></a> The knowledge of the degree of its application to Him, or its being exclusively so applicable, must be, as of all scripture, the result of divine teaching.<a name=224:5></a>

		A simple saint is kept, by what he does know, with certainty of the truth of God, from being misled by what is obscure; but we may remain ignorant of many such points till God in His grace carry the soul on to further light and spiritual apprehension.<a name=224:6></a> I think it a great mistake to suppose (as is stated, if I remember right, in Horne on the Psalms) because an expression is applicable to Christ or used by Him, that the whole psalm is so applicable.<a name=224:7></a> His Spirit speaks in all and throughout each, and in general in reference to the life of a godly Jew.<a name=224:8></a> Where an expression served to give utterance to His own perfect piety and sorrow, He could use it, though the whole psalm could by no means be assigned to Him.<a name=224:9></a> This is a very important principle to keep fast hold of.<a name=224:10></a> There are some psalms, of course, which are positive personal prophecies of Himself.<a name=224:11></a>

		That, in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#69">Psalm  69</a>, Christ is in the mind of the Spirit of God, though not exclusively so, is, I suppose, hardly necessary to prove to Christians, seeing it is one of the most vivid descriptions of His outward sufferings on the cross.<a name=224:12></a> It is in respect to the remarks in my papers on the "Sufferings of Christ," which arose out of the consideration of this psalm, that difficulties arose in some pious minds.<a name=224:13></a> These difficulties I respect, and delight in the jealousy which would not bear anything that they thought touched the divine perfection and relationship with God His Father of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=224:14></a> Whatever expression might throw a cloud on that, or if any did, I condemn

		But then another enquiry presented itself.<a name=225:10></a> Did these two statements, of Christ suffering from man and suffering from God in atonement, explain or rather express all that the Psalms contain in reference to the sufferings of Christ?<a name=225:11></a> They do give all that we have to say to as Christians, and hence the difficulty many Christians find in entering into anything further.<a name=225:12></a> It is true that in the indirect comfort of a soul under law a certain application of the Psalms may be found.<a name=225:13></a> I remember when the only passage in scripture which comforted me was <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#88">Psalm  88</a>, because no ray of comfort was in it; yet I was sure it was a saint who penned it, and I might be a saint though in like anguish.<a name=225:14></a> There is a certain truth in this, but it is needless to pursue it farther here.<a name=225:15></a> But it is important to give all its value to scripture, without in any way turning aside or shrinking from receiving its full force.<a name=225:16></a> God is certainly right.<a name=225:17></a> And when the saint holds fast the truth which He has been taught of God, and where a passage is obscure waits humbly till God teaches him, he will not go wrong.<a name=225:18></a> But to meet effectually a heresy which uses scripture, we must give their full value to

		<a class="footnote" name="#232:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>The persecuting "Him whom thou hast smitten" is literally applicable in @Psalm 69 only to what was done to Him on the cross. (See verses 20, 21.) Still surely in spirit all that passed from Gethsemane, or when He had given Himself up to the suffering of death and rejection, has this same character. It may be remarked, in connection with this, that @Psalm 69 gives the whole course of Christ's suffering life, closing in this solemn bowing to death at the end, His being in the depths. The zeal of God's house ate Him up. It was for the God of Israel's sake He suffered reproach and was alienated from His mother's children. All His grief and holy service made Him the song of the drunkard. Then, verse 14, He turns to what He was brought into at the end, which is the great subject of the Psalm; and the circumstances of the cross are spoken in detail. There we know was the true smiting. It was written, "Smite the Shepherd and the sheep shall be scattered"; but the moment after, in Gethsemane, He had given Himself up to this, all partook of this character morally, though the fact of smiting had not actually taken place. There were the instruments of this as to the outward act; but I need hardly say whose word ordained "Smite the Shepherd," and to whom Christ because of His perfection looked. (See @Matthew 27: 31.) I shall further on take up the truth that atonement was not all the sorrow of death to Christ. The reader should distinctly remark that the subject to which @Psalm 69 and @Psalm 102 are applied is the blessing of Zion and restoration of Israel. (See @Psalm 69: 35, 36, and @Psalm 102: 13-22.)

		There are some chapters in scripture which contain so full and blessed a statement of some great truth of God that they acquire and retain a peculiar hold on the believer's mind.<a name=238:1></a> And though all scripture is given by inspiration of God and has the same authority, yet this exceptional effect of peculiar passages cannot be blamed, because it is always found to be produced by some chapter which contains a special revelation of God and His ways, or the love of Christ towards us.<a name=238:2></a> The chapter of which I would now speak (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#12">2 Corinthians  12</a>) can scarcely be said to have this character.<a name=238:3></a> But it contains so complete and remarkable a display of the extent and wondrous heights and deplorable depths to which saints may go -- of the mighty principles for good or for evil which are at work in those natures which they have (on the one hand, part in the highest associations, and in the lowest degradation on the other), and of the way in which grace acts to give predominancy to good in us; it presents such a view of the whole working of divine grace to give the perfect result, in good and in blessing, of the spiritual conflict now going on in us, through the knowledge of good and evil which we acquired in the fall, that I think it may be fruitful to your readers if I unfold it a little practically.<a name=238:4></a>

		The way in which, in this one chapter, we find the highest state to which a Christian can be elevated, an exceptional one, no doubt, as an experience, and the lowest condition to which he can fall, and all the practical principles on which the divine work is carried on between these two extremes, is very striking.<a name=238:5></a> In the beginning of the chapter we find a saint in the third heaven, in paradise, where flesh could have no part in apprehension or in communication.<a name=238:6></a> He knew not whether he was in the body or out of the body.<a name=238:7></a> There was no consciousness of human existence in flesh; so he could not tell, nor could he utter what he had heard when he returned to the consciousness of flesh again.<a name=238:8></a> Such is the saint at the beginning of the chapter.<a name=238:9></a> At the end we find one, perhaps many, fallen into fornication, uncleanness, and lasciviousness, and unrepentant yet of their sins.<a name=238:10></a> What a contrast of the highest heavenly elevation and

		Paul uses a remarkable expression as to himself when speaking of his elevation to the third heaven: "I know a man in Christ.<a name=239:5></a>" A few preliminary thoughts as to the law will facilitate our understanding this expression.<a name=239:6></a> The law gave to man a perfect and divine rule for his conduct upon the earth.<a name=239:7></a> But it never took him up into heaven.<a name=239:8></a> Heavenly beings, indeed, such as the angels, act upon the abstract perfection of this divine rule as it is stated by the Lord Himself: they love God with all their heart and their neighbour as themselves.<a name=239:9></a> This is creature perfection.<a name=239:10></a> But that is their nature in which God has maintained them.<a name=239:11></a> To prescribe feelings and conduct by law is another thing.<a name=239:12></a> Christians often forget this.<a name=239:13></a> The contents of the law are perfect in their place and for their objects.<a name=239:14></a> It tells us what the right state of a creature is, and it forbids the wrong that flesh is inclined to.<a name=239:15></a> But why <i>prescribe</i> this?<a name=239:16></a> No doubt obedience is a part of perfection in a creature.<a name=239:17></a> Mere doing right would not suffice for a being subject to God to walk righteously, because God has absolute authority over him.<a name=239:18></a> Thus God can, and we know does, prescribe certain particular acts of service to angels; and they obey.<a name=239:19></a>

		But when a state of soul is prescribed -- why is that?<a name=239:20></a> Because it is needed.<a name=239:21></a> It becomes necessary because of the state of the person to whom the command is addressed.<a name=239:22></a> He is otherwise inclined, in danger from other dispositions of doing otherwise.<a name=239:23></a> To command a person to do a thing supposes that he is not doing it, nor about to do it if without a command.<a name=239:24></a> If we add to this that nine of the ten commandments forbid positive sins and evil dispositions, because men are disposed to them (or there were no need to prohibit them), we shall find that the very nature and existence of a law which prescribes the good on God's authority supposes the evil in man's nature which is opposed to it.<a name=239:25></a> This is a deplorable truth, take either aspect of

		<a class="footnote" name="#242:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>This, though quite true, cannot be drawn, I think, from the Greek of the passage, though it may from the English. It has nothing to do with the question now raised by my accusers. *Dedikaiotai* is not freed, but justified. Christ had done with the sin He bore when He died-done with it in putting it away and by dying. He can be said to be personally justified from sin because He had none, and death so far did it, that it proved by obedience even to death, that nothing, no trial, could make it otherwise. He died unto sin. But the statement that "he that has died is justified from sin," I apprehend means rather, "you cannot charge sin, self-will, lust, on a dead man." It becomes true of us when we are dead. Christ's death proved it absolutely true of Him always. The objection made of old to what follows in this passage is a quibble as low and contemptible as it is superficial and false. The words "life to which it was attached" is that in which He was made sin -- as it is expressed here, "in which He bore it." As to saying: "Christ took again the same life He laid down," it is all a blunder: because in the true essential life of Christ, and this is true even of our own souls, He nor we never laid down any life at all. He was always alive, and all live to God. But the life which He had in this world as such He laid down, and never took it again as such. And that is what laying down life means. It means the life in which we live here. Hence scripture speaks of "the days of his flesh." Our life as life in our souls never ceases, much less Christ's. But life in its status (living condition) down here we do not take up again, nor did Christ. That which He had here Christ really, truly, laid down -- His life; who dares deny it? Laying down His life that He might take it again, merely means really dying and living again, alive body and soul. I never die at all if my soul be spoken of. But as to my life, looked at as living here, I die, and I never take that life again, a life of flesh and blood. And so we rightly speak. I take life again, but not that life in which I was in weakness and sorrow. It is a mere low quibble on the word "life," and false; because the life, in which Christ is the same always, He never laid down and never took *again*. He took life again, but not the life He lived here in the flesh, to which I still rightly say sin was attached: not as if He had any in Himself but as made sin and bearing it, and that is what is said. I have, perhaps, spent too many words on this miserable and paltry objection. The doctrine taught is of the last importance. No Christian knows his true place without it.

		In what has preceded we have found three important points brought before us in this chapter.<a name=248:1></a> First, the man in Christ; secondly, the gross evil of the flesh if our members be not mortified; thirdly, that this same flesh is not at all corrected in its tendencies even by a man's being in the third heaven, nor by anything else.<a name=248:2></a> Paul needed a messenger of Satan to buffet him, lest he should be puffed up.<a name=248:3></a> There is another collateral point indeed, which I would here briefly notice; the difference between our abstract position as men in Christ (and we are entitled to consider ourselves as such; it is our true position as Christians according to grace), and our actual condition with the consciousness of the existence of the flesh and all our bodily circumstances and infirmities down here.<a name=248:4></a> Into this actual condition we have now to follow Paul in our chapter, and to learn where power is to be found to walk rightly in it.<a name=248:5></a> The flesh exists unchangeable in its nature, a pure hindrance.<a name=248:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, we may remark that no extent of knowledge, even where given of God, is in itself spiritual power in our souls.<a name=248:7></a> We cannot doubt that such revelations as Paul received in the third heaven strengthened his own faith, made him understand that it was well worth sacrificing a miserable life, such as this world's life is, for it, and gave him a consciousness of what he was contending for, a sense of the divine things he had to do with, which must have exercised an immense influence upon his career in this world.<a name=248:8></a> But it was not immediate power in conflict in the mixed state in which he found himself when he had to speak of "myself Paul.<a name=248:9></a>" He had, and so have we, to walk by faith, and not by sight.<a name=248:10></a> The wickedest man would not sin while his mind had the glory of God Himself before his eyes; but that would no way prove the state of his heart and affections when it was removed.<a name=248:11></a> Like Balaam, he would turn to his vomit again.<a name=248:12></a> So in point of fact the Christian (however strengthened and refreshed by times on the road by what is almost like sight to him, and by communications of divine love to his soul) has to walk by faith, and not always in these sensible apprehensions of divine results in glory.<a name=248:13></a> Not that he is to walk in the flesh or lose communion, but he is not always under the power of especial communications of the glory conferred on him, and divine love to his soul.<a name=248:14></a> Paul knew a <i>man fourteen years ago</i> -- not every day in that state.<a name=248:15></a> He could rejoice <i>in the Lord always</i>.<a name=248:16></a> Some Christians are apt to confound

		Here we find first the privilege of having a title to hold ourselves dead.<a name=249:7></a> We are <i>not debtors to the flesh</i>.<a name=249:8></a> It has no kind of title over us.<a name=249:9></a> We are not in the flesh.<a name=249:10></a> We may reckon ourselves dead and alive unto God, and sin shall not have dominion over us.<a name=249:11></a> It is all-important to hold this fast.<a name=249:12></a> The flesh is unchanged, but there is no necessity of walking in it -- not more as to our thoughts than as to our outward conduct.<a name=249:13></a> The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and of death; sin in the flesh is condemned by the death of Christ; the power it had over us, when under law (if not lawless), it has no longer.<a name=249:14></a> <i>When we were</i> in the flesh the motions of sin which were by the law wrought in us all manner of concupiscence.<a name=249:15></a> But we are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of Christ dwells in us.<a name=249:16></a> We are delivered from the law, having died in that in which we were held.<a name=249:17></a> Our whole condition is changed.<a name=249:18></a> What the law could not do just because it was weak through the flesh, God sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, has condemned sin in the flesh.<a name=249:19></a>

		But if the flesh be not changed, how is this realized in practice?<a name=249:20></a> It is this which is taught us here.<a name=249:21></a> It is first the giving conscious nothingness and weakness in the flesh.<a name=249:22></a> This is not power, but it is the practical way to it.<a name=249:23></a> We are entitled, as to our standing before God, to reckon ourselves dead unto sin and alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord, and in practice to hold ourselves, as in this condition, not debtors to the flesh to live after the flesh; and sin shall not have dominion over us, for we are not under law, but under grace.<a name=249:24></a> But our chapter goes farther than this: it shews us power so to walk.<a name=249:25></a> The flesh is then practically put down.<a name=249:26></a> The measure, as stated by the apostle, is this -- "Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our body.<a name=249:27></a>" His object was not to gain

		That self should feel self nothing, or a hindrance, is a most divine work (though it be a shame to a man who has been in the third heaven to think <i>himself</i> something in respect of it: but flesh is incorrigible), but as to the instrumentality used, a mean and miserable process, such as becomes making nothing of flesh.<a name=251:17></a> If death is our deliverance from all sin, we must taste it for our deliverance practically.<a name=251:18></a> The bitter water of Marah must be tasted when the salt waters of the Red Sea have delivered us from Egypt for ever and ever.<a name=251:19></a> Put the wood of the tree, the cross of Christ, into our cross, and all will be sweet.<a name=251:20></a> "Crucified" is terrible work -- crucified with Christ, joy and deliverance; reproach is cruel -- the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt.<a name=251:21></a> But there are cases where the will and natural reluctance of the flesh to suffer are in question; there are also those which are characterized by the danger of positive evil working, as pride or vanity in the case of Paul.<a name=251:22></a> As to all, death must be tasted.<a name=251:23></a> The nothingness and incompetency of all flesh must be felt where it would be disposed to think itself competent.<a name=251:24></a> It must find its pretensions arrested and set aside when it has, or would be disposed to have, such; it must find itself consciously weak where it might hope to be strong or capable of something.<a name=251:25></a>

		As to what self would lean on, it must find itself a hindering flesh where it would pretend to be a helping one.<a name=252:1></a> It is really nothing in the work and path of God; but when it would be positively something, it must be made to feel itself a positive hindrance.<a name=252:2></a> This is not the end, but it is the way.<a name=252:3></a> We must be humbled when we are not humble, or even in danger of not being so.<a name=252:4></a> This work may come in preventively.<a name=252:5></a> But the flesh must be nothing if we are to have blessing; and in order that the new man, which is content that God should be all, and knows its power is in Christ only, may be free and happy, and God, as it desires, may be glorified.<a name=252:6></a> The power of Satan and the power of death concur in ministering to our usefulness in Christ, because Satan wields this power to kill practically the flesh, and we have another life which lives in Christ and lives for Him.<a name=252:7></a> This question is first settled as regards righteousness, as we have seen: we are dead and risen again; but it has to be practically settled as regards life and power of walk also.<a name=252:8></a> So that we may say, whatever our little measure may be, "To me to live is Christ.<a name=252:9></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		But the fact that the flesh is thus practically mortified is not in itself power: we must be positively dependent on another -- glad to be so, if our heart is in Christ's service, and that we find His help only can make us to serve Him.<a name=252:10></a> To have Him is joy in every way.<a name=252:11></a> This is what follows: "I will glory in my infirmities" -- not sin, but what broke down the flesh in its will and hindered sin, "that the power of Christ may rest upon me.<a name=252:12></a>" Here is positive power capable of everything, or rendering us capable of everything in the path of obedience, giving no power at all out of it, but fulfilling in power all the energy of love in obedience.<a name=252:13></a> For the Christian path is not mere legal obedience which submits to a will which arrests and stops our will, but an obedience which serves with delight in love, and in which love is positively and energetically active in doing good.<a name=252:14></a> This path is regulated by the Lord's will and fulfilled by the Lord's power, but that power can have no adventitious aid.<a name=252:15></a> It must be the strength in us of a dependent nature.<a name=252:16></a> In this is the right condition of the creature, obedience and conscious dependence (and both delighted in) on One who has title, and alone has title, to all the praise; who loves us, and on whose love we lean.<a name=252:17></a>

	<div class="page-number">

	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ's power sustains and enables us: flesh, only a hindrance to that, must be put down, and practically annulled, that Christ may work freely in us according to the blessing of that love.<a name=253:1></a> We then say the love of Christ constrains us.<a name=253:2></a> I can do all things through Him which strengtheneth me, the only true abiding state of the Christian, be he babe or father in Christ; only the thing he may have to do may be different, and his temptations too.<a name=253:3></a> God in all cases is faithful not to suffer him to be tempted above that he is able.<a name=253:4></a> When a man is in Christ, then, redeemed, quickened, and united to the Head, accepted in the Beloved, the work of God in order to power is to break down and bring the flesh to conscious nothingness wherever it is needed; not by mending, using, ameliorating, but, if needed because of its will to be something, breaking it down, yea, making it for man's capabilities of acting a sensible hindrance.<a name=253:5></a> That is all that God makes of man as to his flesh and competency; but there is a deep lesson of blessing in it besides being the path of power in source.<a name=253:6></a> We are emptied of self, and Christ (that is, purity, and love, and blessing -- God known to us in grace) becomes everything to us, the more unhindered joy of the soul, made practically like Him.<a name=253:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But we become now sensibly dependent, and Christ our power, I do not say sensibly power; for though there may be a consciousness of His strength, the service and work is done indeed, but done without any conscious strength.<a name=253:8></a> It may be done with joy, done in communion with Christ, and thus with joy in the service itself.<a name=253:9></a> It may be done with fear and trembling, and hence with no joy, though with confidence.<a name=253:10></a> That depends much upon how far we have to meet the sensible power of the enemy, always in weakness as to self, always in confidence as to Christ, that it is His work, and He the doer of it, though He may use us as instruments.<a name=253:11></a> And this operation is not merely an effect in us, though there be one: it is the positive power of Christ, a real acting and working of His power, for which the sensible putting down of flesh is only preparatory, that it might be evidently not the power of flesh, and that there might be no mixture of the two in our minds.<a name=253:12></a> Hence the flesh is turned into positive, sensible weakness.<a name=253:13></a> But the power of Christ rests upon us, so that it is joy to the soul because He uses us -- connects Himself, so to speak, with us -- deigns to make us the instruments and servants, willing and rejoicing servants, of this power.<a name=253:14></a> It is His power, but it rests

	<div class="paragraph">
		The path of strength, then, is the being made sensible of our own weakness, so that divine strength, which will never be a supplement to flesh's strength, may come in.<a name=254:3></a> Thus there is entire dependence, and the positive coming in of Christ's power to work by us.<a name=254:4></a> If Paul's bodily presence was weak, and his speech contemptible, and there was something which tended to make him despised, by whose power was it that such wondrous blessing for the whole world flowed forth on all sides, from Jerusalem round about unto Illyricum?<a name=254:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One or two remarks more, and I will close my imperfect suggestions on this chapter.<a name=254:6></a> First, remark, that the humbling process with Paul was no depriving of the abundance of the revelations, or weakening the consciousness that he was a man in Christ.<a name=254:7></a> This would have been positive loss.<a name=254:8></a> These were fully maintained and gloried in.<a name=254:9></a> The use the flesh would make of them when consciously down here in the body, in the world, was met by an accessory humbling process carried on in the flesh itself.<a name=254:10></a> Next, remark, that it is not merely power which is gained by this process.<a name=254:11></a> The discernment of good and evil, in its more subtle characters, is greatly increased; the judgment and knowledge of flesh is greatly strengthened and deepened.<a name=254:12></a> Hence the liberty of the new man with God, confidence in Him, the sense of the careful and gracious interest He takes in us, and intercourse founded on this confidence, are greatly increased.<a name=254:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Further, remark, that dealing with self, our own spiritual condition, is the secret of <i>power</i>, not the quantity of divine revelations we have to communicate, valuable as this may be in its place.<a name=254:14></a> For power Paul was dealt with in his own soul, its own dangers and state, and then Christ's power rested on him.<a name=254:15></a> Lastly, as to our glorying in our position in Christ; it is all right.<a name=254:16></a> "Of such a one I will glory; yet of myself I will not glory but in mine infirmities.<a name=254:17></a>" When I think of my place in Christ, of the "man in Christ," of such a one we ought to glory.<a name=254:18></a> This is no presumption.<a name=254:19></a> It cannot be otherwise, whenever we know ourselves in Christ.<a name=254:20></a> Do you think I can do anything but glory in being in Christ, and like Christ in glory?<a name=254:21></a> Of such a one I will.<a name=254:22></a> Let no pretended humility deprive us of this.<a name=254:23></a> It is legalism.<a name=254:24></a> Of myself, of that of which I have the living consciousness of a man down here, I cannot

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would add to these, one collateral observation.<a name=255:2></a> The Lord can unite discipline with positive suffering for Christ, though the two things are quite distinct.<a name=255:3></a> When Paul was subjected to contempt in his preaching, it was for Christ's sake he suffered, yet the form of it was, we have seen, a discipline to prevent his being puffed up.<a name=255:4></a> This may be seen doctrinally stated in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12:2">Hebrews  12:2</a>-11.<a name=255:5></a> In verses 2-4, we suffer with Christ, striving against sin, even to martyrdom and death.<a name=255:6></a> In verses 5-11, the same process is the discipline of the Lord, that we may be partakers of His holiness.<a name=255:7></a> How wise and most gracious of the Lord's ways to turn our needed discipline into the privilege of suffering for Christ's sake, so that we can glory in our infirmities!<a name=255:8></a> There is chastening which has not this character, being for positive evil.<a name=255:9></a> In this, doubtless, we have to thank God, but it is another thing.<a name=255:10></a>

		In fine, before God we have the "man in Christ" -- blessed position -- and which is perfection where we want it; and as to our place before men, besides Christ in us as life, the power of Christ (where we practically want it -- in weakness and imperfection down here) resting on the man for walk and service before men.<a name=255:11></a> The first is the basis of all our walk, but it does not suffice for power.<a name=255:12></a> This is had in daily dependence in which we walk, as humbled in ourselves, that Christ may be glorified, and the flesh practically annulled.<a name=255:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then we come to the installing of Him in this office.<a name=259:21></a> "As he saith, also, in another place, Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of Melchisedec.<a name=259:22></a>" Not like a high priest taken from among men, who dies and gives the office to some one else, but He is a priest for ever, etc.<a name=259:23></a> The carrying on of the priesthood of Christ in heaven is founded upon an already completed salvation, as regards both blood-shedding and righteousness.<a name=259:24></a> If the righteousness were not already perfect, the failure must bring down judgment instead of intercession.<a name=259:25></a> If propitiation had not been made for the sin, the sin must be the cause of judgment.<a name=259:26></a> But righteousness having been perfectly made in Christ, and made for us, He sits now in heaven, and intercedes

		for those for whom propitiation has been made through His blood.<a name=260:1></a> The atonement has been perfectly accomplished, sin is put away, and I am made the very righteousness of God in Christ.<a name=260:2></a> But the question still remains of our intercourse in this holy place with God in blessing, and in the perfect enjoyment of the position He has brought us into by this death and judgment through which Christ has passed.<a name=260:3></a> Here the intercession comes in: "We have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.<a name=260:4></a>" Thus we have the Lord Jesus Christ in the dignity of His Person, as Son of God, and in the title for office, as priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.<a name=260:5></a> If He is to be our priest in the presence of God, we have Him in the dignity in which He can carry it on.<a name=260:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But, then, there is another difficulty.<a name=260:7></a> If He has this mighty title, if He is the Son, how can He enter into all the sorrows and trials of such poor creatures as we are?<a name=260:8></a> If He were a priest like another man, He could understand the infirmities of other men.<a name=260:9></a>

		But I answer, The priesthood is carried on where there cannot be a thought of infirmity, where the enjoyment is spiritual enjoyment, where, if there were a thought of the flesh or of sin, there could be no communion with God.<a name=260:10></a> Therefore the place of Christ, as priest, is necessarily out of reach of all infirmity.<a name=260:11></a> Another priest could join with sinners, and feel their infirmities, as being himself a partaker of them.<a name=260:12></a> How, then, can the Lord Jesus Christ be fitted, in that sense of the word, to be our high priest?<a name=260:13></a> It is not while He has His priesthood that He is thus fitted for the office.<a name=260:14></a> It is what He was upon earth, not what He is now as a priest, that has fitted Him for such a work.<a name=260:15></a> "Such an high priest became us," etc.<a name=260:16></a> He has gone through the difficulties and trials of a godly and perfect man upon earth.<a name=260:17></a> He has known every possible difficulty which a godly man can find in his path through this world, and the trials too.<a name=260:18></a> He suffered and was "tempted in all points like as we are, yet without sin.<a name=260:19></a>" Now that is just what I want.<a name=260:20></a> I do not want sympathy with my sin; I find the word of God to cut it down, but no sympathy with it.<a name=260:21></a> Christ does not intercede for the flesh.<a name=260:22></a> What I want Christ's help for is for the new man against my flesh.<a name=260:23></a> I want to be helped as a believer going through this world, against myself, so far as the flesh is there.<a name=260:24></a>

		things were entirely changed in His whole position (not yet as drinking the cup from God but) when He comes and has Satan's power let loose upon Him (and there He can look forward to wrath), He was going through all that darkness which the power of Satan could bring upon Him, with the wrath of God staring Him in the face.<a name=262:1></a> For that reason He can sympathize with the remnant of Israel in the sufferings that they will pass through.<a name=262:2></a> Wherever this character of suffering comes in, judgment against man is what we find called for.<a name=262:3></a> Hence the constant appeal to God to arise and avenge them on their adversaries, which we find throughout the Psalms.<a name=262:4></a> Whereas when expiation is made, it is mercy that is called for.<a name=262:5></a> In the one case, it is calling for judgment upon men, because men, as the instruments of Satan, are making Christ suffer; but the moment He is suffering from God, because of atonement for sin, it is exactly the contrary.<a name=262:6></a> You then read, "I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I sing praise unto thee.<a name=262:7></a>" It is all grace, and nothing else.<a name=262:8></a>

		THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before entering on the solemn and interesting question of our righteousness, the righteousness of God, I will shortly notice what is objected, and dispose of it, so as to be able then to treat the subject unhinderedly for edification, and not controversy.<a name=266:1></a> The principle in question it is well to state; it is, I fully admit, a most grave and important one.<a name=266:2></a> Not that beloved and truly godly souls have not been, as I judge, cloudy upon what was really of great moment to their true and godly liberty in Christ, which is the power of a Christian walk; not that they have not been violent, as men generally are, in the sustainment of that in which they are wrong.<a name=266:3></a> But this does not destroy the importance of being clear.<a name=266:4></a> Still, I freely and fully, yea, joyfully, acknowledge (as choice and devoted servants of Christ, whom I respect, and whose devotedness I look up to) persons who have held on this subject doctrines which I believe to be a mistake.<a name=266:5></a> I have thus no animosity as regards this point.<a name=266:6></a> The point, however, is important, and what saints have held by infirmity of judgment may become a very great hindrance to the progress of souls, and a weapon in the hands of the enemy: witness the Judaism of the early Church at Jerusalem, and the opposition raised to Paul on the very same ground.<a name=266:7></a> The principles, indeed, which were then in question are the same which now partially agitate the Church of God, and largely hinder its blessing and testimony, and obscure its faith.<a name=266:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The question is this: Is the righteousness of God legal righteousness?<a name=266:9></a> I may state the question in the words of a sermon, which in its main purport and object I can with my whole heart desire a blessing upon, so that I shall avoid an apparent attack upon others, and any supposition of evil will towards him from whom I quote.<a name=266:10></a> The statement, too, has the advantage, not always found, of stating that side of the question with peremptory decision.<a name=266:11></a> I read in Mr.<a name=266:12></a> Molyneux's sermon (preached July 18th, 1858, at the special services at Exeter Hall), in pages 17, 18, what follows: "Do you know this, my dear brethren, that no man can enter into the kingdom of heaven unless he is garbed in a perfect robe of righteousness?<a name=266:13></a>" So far (save that "the kingdom of heaven" is used for "heaven," which to the practised mind -- practised I mean in

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I believe, and bless God for the truth, that Christ is our righteousness and that by His obedience we are made righteous.<a name=267:21></a> It is the settled peace of my soul, as I trust it is of the author's.<a name=267:22></a> The important point here is the contrast between the death and sufferings of Christ, as winning our forgiveness, and His obedience as our justifying righteousness -- what is sometimes called His active and passive obedience.<a name=267:23></a> This doctrine, however, is not fully seen until another point is noticed -- the legal character of this righteousness.<a name=267:24></a> Mr Molyneux states it in principle as clearly as possible.<a name=267:25></a> It is written on the gate of heaven "Do this and live.<a name=267:26></a>" That is positively and characteristically, as the apostle teaches us, legal righteousness.<a name=267:27></a> "To Adam it was so said.<a name=267:28></a>" To enter

		I affirm that the doctrine of scripture is wholly different, and that this doctrine (wholly unintentionally, I admit, so that I do not impute the consequence to those who hold it) denies the extent of sin and the true character of redemption.<a name=268:3></a> Law is perfect in its place.<a name=268:4></a> The angels accomplish it in its highest character; he who loves does too, as the apostle teaches us.<a name=268:5></a> I say this by way of preface, that there may be no mistake.<a name=268:6></a> But that a holy nature does with delight what is in the law is a different thing from the way a sinner obtains righteousness and eternal life.<a name=268:7></a> Doing with delight, when in possession of life, is a different thing from doing in order to obtain life.<a name=268:8></a> Now what I say is, The law was never given that we might obtain righteousness or life by it, nor ever could have been.<a name=268:9></a> It was introduced by the by to convince of sin.<a name=268:10></a> A sinless being, who had life, did not want a law of righteousness to obtain it; a sinful creature with a law of righteousness could only be condemned.<a name=268:11></a> "Do this and live" is not written on the gate of heaven.<a name=268:12></a> It was written on Sinai, which is not the gate of heaven.<a name=268:13></a> It is the gate of death and condemnation.<a name=268:14></a> It was not said to Adam Do this and live.<a name=268:15></a> He lost the life he had by disobedience.<a name=268:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle, on the whole matter, contradicts the statement explicitly.<a name=268:17></a> "Moses," he says, "describeth the righteousness which is of the law, that the man which doeth these shall live by them.<a name=268:18></a> But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise .<a name=268:19></a>.<a name=268:20></a>.<a name=268:21></a> that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.<a name=268:22></a>" The righteousness of faith is contrasted with that of law, which says, Do this and live.<a name=268:23></a> It does not accept its principle and find a means of meeting its requirements by another, but brings in righteousness on another principle.<a name=268:24></a> It speaks on another wise.<a name=268:25></a> The great evil of the whole scheme is, that it is a righteousness demanded of man as born of Adam, though another may furnish it.<a name=268:26></a> The thing furnished is man's righteousness.<a name=268:27></a> If Christ has done it for me, still it is what I ought to have done.<a name=268:28></a> It is meeting the demand on me -- Do this and live.<a name=268:29></a> If it is to be a satisfying the demand of righteousness on me, it is the doing what is demanded which makes out the righteousness.<a name=268:30></a> If "Do this and live" is written on the gate of heaven, it is doing <i>this</i> that is the righteousness, and doing nothing else

		and nothing more.<a name=269:1></a> It may have been, if such be the truth, very gracious of the Lord to have done it for me, but that was what was to be done.<a name=269:2></a> <i>Righteousness</i>, wrought out by meeting the demand of a superior, can only be in doing exactly what is demanded.<a name=269:3></a> What is else than this has not the character of righteousness.<a name=269:4></a> And if we take the law as the <i>perfect</i> rule of what the creature ought to be, as indeed it was, then there can be nothing more; or else the rule is not a perfect one, and the righteousness not a righteousness according to the law, nor a meeting what I ought to do.<a name=269:5></a> It is not the obedience required of me.<a name=269:6></a> Besides, the whole principle is a mistake; for the law, when spiritually apprehended, reaches the disposition and condition of the heart.<a name=269:7></a> It does not only say, Do, but Be.<a name=269:8></a> But then life is there.<a name=269:9></a> If I say Love and do not lust (the two aspects of the law), righteousness is taken out of the sphere of doing.<a name=269:10></a> Doing becomes evidence of a state and nature.<a name=269:11></a> But is the motto of heaven a denial of the spirituality of the law?<a name=269:12></a> And so far from "Do this and live" being on the gates of heaven, I know of no scripture which shews that a doer of the law was entitled to heaven, or which promises heaven to a doer of the law, as having thereby such title.<a name=269:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And now mark the effect of the discovery of the spirituality of the law.<a name=269:14></a> It becomes not a claim to do, but a criterion of the state of a man.<a name=269:15></a> Its very nature and effect is changed: by it is the knowledge of sin.<a name=269:16></a> A command for <i>qualities</i> in a man, love and no lusts, ceases to be a command to do, and is condemnation and death, and <i>nothing else</i>.<a name=269:17></a> The whole ground and principle of my standing is changed.<a name=269:18></a> "I through law am dead to law.<a name=269:19></a>" That is not looking to another to fulfil it for me, because I have failed.<a name=269:20></a> What I find in scripture is this, that man, the Adam race, has been as such tried and tested.<a name=269:21></a> Failing when innocent, he has been tried without law, and was lawless; under law, and was a law-breaker: I may add, tried by the presentation of divine goodness in Christ, and he hated it.<a name=269:22></a> The more we go into detail, the more we shall find that exhibited, as in priesthood in Aaron's sons, in obedient royalty in David's, in supreme power in Nebuchadnezzar's.<a name=269:23></a>

		But the great moral principles of it, the three stages of sin, suffice here: lust; lawlessness in will, or transgression; and hatred of God Himself as goodness.<a name=269:24></a> The first Adam, the flesh, is thoroughly and wholly condemned.<a name=269:25></a> Another Adam is set up -- the Second man: God looks for nothing from the first.<a name=269:26></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The false principle of all this system is, that it is <i>making</i> out the righteousness of the first Adam under the law, instead of putting us in the Second entirely and absolutely, and treating the first as dead and gone.<a name=270:10></a> Had I then no personal responsibility?<a name=270:11></a> Not indeed under law, as a Gentile -- still I had.<a name=270:12></a> Sin reigned over me and death.<a name=270:13></a> Hence Christ was, in sovereign grace, made sin for me and died, not to build up the old man again, after death, when it was dead, and confer righteousness on it, but to put me in a wholly new position in the heavenly man, who is my righteousness; to set me in the righteousness of God, seated in heavenly places in Him.<a name=270:14></a> Christ was the root and spring in life of the redeemed race; and the first is wholly set aside, judged, condemned, and dead.<a name=270:15></a> Christ is of God righteousness to us.<a name=270:16></a> All is wholly new, though we are personally brought into it only as quickened with the life of the second Adam, having Him for our life.<a name=270:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is the special doctrine of Paul: no thought of a righteousness of law acquired by another for us.<a name=270:18></a> There is atonement for sin, in which we lay, which we had committed as in the first Adam; but I repeat, no conferring of righteousness on it, but closing its history, and being before God in death, in which He in grace took its place, in respect of the judgment due to it.<a name=270:19></a> "I am dead to the law, by the body of Christ, being married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead.<a name=270:20></a>"

		And when the Spirit of God, in the Ephesians, speaks, in its full extent, of the blessing we are called to, He does not speak of men as having <i>lived</i> in sin, or being condemned under law as having a life in which they had to keep law.<a name=271:4></a> Man was dead, wholly dead, in trespasses and sins; the Jew is viewed not as a transgressor, but as by nature a child of wrath, even as others.<a name=271:5></a> But what is the first object then presented?<a name=271:6></a> Christ dead (i.<a name=271:7></a>e.<a name=271:8></a>, in the place, by grace, where we were), raised far above all principality and power, and then we, "quickened together with him, raised up together, and made to sit in heavenly places in him.<a name=271:9></a>" In view of the counsels of God there was, so to speak, no living man at all.<a name=271:10></a> There was man dead in trespasses and sins, but a Christ dead there too; and as God raised up Him, so us with Him who descended for us there.<a name=271:11></a> When God deals with us morally, as responsible beings, He does see us living in sin, breaking law, despising goodness.<a name=271:12></a> This last is the way the point is looked at in the Epistle to the Romans.<a name=271:13></a> In the Ephesians it is simply a new creation when we are dead.<a name=271:14></a>

		We have now to examine the scriptural use of it in connection with sacrifice, and in particular the passage in Peter.<a name=295:19></a> A<i>nenegke</i> is a sacrificial word.<a name=295:20></a> It is used here (if we are to take it as it usually is taken, as referring to <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#53:12">Isaiah  53:12</a>) for <i>nasa</i>, which means "to lift up, to bear, to forgive," and here confessedly "to bear.<a name=295:21></a>" It is alleged -- for I have considered diligently what is alleged against it -- that it cannot mean "to bear passively with", as would be the case with <i>anenegke epi to</i>.<a name=295:22></a> This is a mistake.<a name=295:23></a> Aaron was to bear the names of the children upon his heart (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#28:29">Exodus  28:29</a>).<a name=295:24></a> So with the judgment, in verse 30.<a name=295:25></a>

		that He would <i>not use a sacrificial vicarious word in</i> verse 4, but would in verse 12 (that is, that the "bearing," in verse 4, was not sacrificial, but is in verse 12); for <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#9:28">Hebrews  9:28</a>, that Christ was once offered <i>eis to pollon anenegkein amartias</i>, are the very words of <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#53:12">Isaiah  53:12</a>.<a name=296:1></a> So that, if this is of any value, we have not an inference that it cannot be used in one place because it is not in another; and that Peter, if he had quoted it, would have used another word for "<i>nasa</i>" in verse 12, because Matthew did in verse 4 (an argument, when said to be from inspiration, which I decline characterizing), but a direct proof that inspiration will not use a vicarious sacrificial word as to Christ's living sympathies and sorrows; but that it will and does use it when it speaks of bearing sins when offered up to God.<a name=296:2></a>

		<i>Anapherein epi to thusiasterion is</i> never used for bringing or bearing sins up to the altar; what it is used for has been fully shewn.<a name=299:10></a> But the supposition that <i>epi</i> with an accusative means actively bringing up to, and then rest, is a mistake.<a name=299:11></a> There may be grammatically the idea by implication that that which is <i>epi to is</i> not always and naturally there; but as a matter of fact, it does mean resting on a place or thing at the time spoken of.<a name=299:12></a> Thus, <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13:2">Matthew  13:2</a>, "All the multitude stood" <i>epi ton aigialon.<a name=299:13></a> So</i> <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#19:28">Matthew  19:28</a>, "Ye shall sit on twelve thrones," <i>epi dodeka thronous</i>.<a name=299:14></a> <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10:17">Acts  10:17</a>; chapter 11: 11, <i>epestesan epi ton pulona epi ten oikian</i>.<a name=299:15></a> Winer's "Grammatik" (section 583) may be seen for this use and the use of <i>epi</i> with a genitive for <i>motion</i>.<a name=299:16></a> See a singular example in <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#3:5">Leviticus  3:5</a>, the pieces of the peace-offering on the burnt-offering, <i>epi ta</i> -- on the wood, <i>epi ta</i> -- on the fire, <i>epi tou</i>.<a name=299:17></a> This may be from the fire being always there belonging to the altar, whereas the wood was brought there: <i>ousin</i> will be understood then before it.<a name=299:18></a> In many cases, I have no doubt that the real cause of the accusative is this; when the preposition of the compound verb implies motion, there will be the accusative though the whole sense

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not merely that Christ fulfilled the law for us so that we may be said to have fulfilled it; that is a tolerably ancient doctrine.<a name=305:9></a> It dates from the close of the Reformation.<a name=305:10></a> I am not aware that it was ever heard of before.<a name=305:11></a> The Reformers were not clear in everything.<a name=305:12></a> The Homilies of the Establishment teach that Christ fulfilled the law for us in His life.<a name=305:13></a> Nor, for my part, if thus vaguely and generally stated, should I have anything which would rouse me to combat what was said, though it would be probable the person was not clear.<a name=305:14></a> But the writer's notion of justification, its contrast with pardon, never enters into the minds of the authors of these Homilies.<a name=305:15></a> Thus speaks the Homily: "Every man of necessity is constrained to seek for another righteousness, or justification, to be received at God's own hands; that is to say, the forgiveness of sins and trespasses.<a name=305:16></a>" So that for them justification was forgiveness.<a name=305:17></a> The two were identified with "that is to say.<a name=305:18></a>" So again, in the second part, "for to have only by him remission of our sins, or justification.<a name=305:19></a>"

		So Calvin: "To justify, therefore, is nothing else than to acquit from the charge of guilt, as if innocency were proved.<a name=305:20></a>" (On God's justifying the wicked.<a name=305:21></a>) Again, he says (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3:26">Romans  3:26</a>), "What can be the sense, unless by the benefit of faith, to free from condemnation which their iniquity merited?<a name=305:22></a>" So, in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13">Acts  13</a>, "Thou seest how, after remission of sins, this justification is put as an interpretation <i>(in loco interpretationis)</i>, so he absolves by the imputation of righteousness.<a name=305:23></a>" Further, "But in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#4:6">Romans  4:6</a>-8 he first calls [it] imputation of righteousness, nor doubts to place that in the remission of sins.<a name=305:24></a>" And this he does very definitely; he says, after quoting the passage, "There, certainly he does not discuss a part of justification, but the whole of the thing itself; whence it appears that this justice which is spoken of is simply opposed to guilt.<a name=305:25></a>"

		So when he speaks of <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5">2 Corinthians  5</a>, "The righteousness of God in him," he says, "In this place nothing else is to be understood than that we stand supported by the expiation of Christ's death before the tribunal of God.<a name=306:1></a>" Again, "God by pardoning justifies.<a name=306:2></a>" Again, "Certainly he does not cite the prophet as a witness, as if he taught that the pardon of sins was a part of righteousness, or that it contributed to the justifying a man, but includes the whole righteousness in gratuitous remission.<a name=306:3></a>" All this he calls Christ's righteousness.<a name=306:4></a> And his language (Inst.<a name=306:5></a> III, 17: 13) excludes all idea of Christ's making a righteousness for us by the keeping of the law.<a name=306:6></a> So in his commentary: "That most beautiful sentence therefore remains to us safe -- he is justified by faith who is purged before God by the gratuitous remission of sins.<a name=306:7></a>" These doctrines are asserted by him over and over again, and proved by scripture.<a name=306:8></a> Once he states on <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3:31">Romans  3:31</a>, "but when we come to Christ first, the exact righteousness of the Lord is found in Him, which, by imputation, also becomes ours.<a name=306:9></a>" But even this makes no part of his general doctrine; and he uses it only as a proof that the law is confirmed -- never as meeting our failures.<a name=306:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, I do not accept simply the doctrine of the Homilies or Calvin.<a name=306:11></a> But this is certain, that both carefully contradict the distinction between the forgiveness of sins and imputation of righteousness.<a name=306:12></a> When Calvin speaks of the words "the obedience of one," he applies it to the satisfaction offered to His Father.<a name=306:13></a> Any one can see that what is charged as a grievous error is distinctly affirmed by the Homilies and by Calvin, and that for them remission of sins is justification.<a name=306:14></a> The truth is, the Reformers were charged, as Paul was, and as the Brethren are, with setting aside the law.<a name=306:15></a> They declare that they establish it; and in one place Calvin, as proving they do, says -- Christ fulfilled it, which is reckoned to us; but the law is specially introduced by Calvin as an answer to works of supererogation or satisfaction.<a name=306:16></a> It works, you must take law (is the argument); but law does not speak of particular acts, but if you are to have righteousness by it, you must keep it all, and no man has done this It was thus against the merit of partial works he uses the requirement of the law, and in doing this, never hints at Christ's fulfilling it as the answer to our failure.<a name=306:17></a> Only in his

		If we turn to Luther, the whole thought is entirely foreign to him.<a name=307:2></a> He declares the law to have only ceased when Christ came, if you take it literally; and if spiritually, as soon as Christ is known in the soul; that its only use was previously on account of sin, and to convict of it, and that we have nothing more whatever to say to it; that it was given to Israel, not to the heathen at all; only that as to fundamentals, natural conscience supplied its place, and that we have nothing to say to it.<a name=307:3></a> His language is the strongest possible.<a name=307:4></a> For those who are already righteous (through faith in Christ) are far outside and above all laws (weit ausser und uber all Gesetze).<a name=307:5></a> Therefore should the law be laid on those alone who are not yet righteous, and yet would willingly be righteous, yet not for ever, but for a time, until the righteousness which is by faith come; not that such righteousness be obtained by law, for such is not rightly using but misusing the law, but that they may, alarmed and humbled, flee to Christ, who is the end of the law for righteousness to all those who believe (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#3:19">Galatians  3:19</a>-23).<a name=307:6></a> "The law is a light which makes plain and clear, not grace, also not righteousness whereby man obtains life, but sin, death -- God's wrath and judgment.<a name=307:7></a> That is the proper and right work of the law, in which it should remain, and not take a step further.<a name=307:8></a>" So "when the law has accomplished its work or office, that is, given me to recognize my sin, frightened me, and revealed God's anger and judgments .<a name=307:9></a>.<a name=307:10></a>.<a name=307:11></a> it has reached its set time and end, so that it is to cease and leave me unplagued by its tyranny.<a name=307:12></a>" So, in the first book of Moses, "The law of Moses concerns the Jews, which does not bind us any more.<a name=307:13></a> For the law is given to the Jewish people alone, and the heathen are excluded.<a name=307:14></a>" He then directly refers to the moral law, saying that the heathen have the main points in their conscience.<a name=307:15></a> "It is not new what Moses commands here.<a name=307:16></a>" He says, "Thus I keep the commandments now, not because Moses has commanded them.<a name=307:17></a>" "But," he says, "it is objected, God spoke to them.<a name=307:18></a>" His answer is, "This is not all, that God has spoken it: we must know to whom he spoke it.<a name=307:19></a>" "Therefore answer, Leave Moses and his people together; it is finished with them, it does not concern me.<a name=307:20></a> I have the word which regards me -- we have the gospel.<a name=307:21></a>" "Only," he says, "it is to be preached to make men fear, so as to drive them to the gospel.<a name=307:22></a>"

		I have now gone through scripture, I trust fairly, and as completely as I could, and referred to the illustration by which alone the "Record" seeks to support its doctrine.<a name=316:1></a> I have referred to the Reformers, not as any authority (for the word of God alone is that), but in reply to the statement that the whole Church of God teaches this doctrine.<a name=316:2></a> I have quoted the Institutes of Calvin and his commentary, the commentary of Luther on the Galatians and first book of Moses, and the Homilies of the Establishment.<a name=316:3></a> I will add here two sentences from the "Apology for the Confession of Augsburg," and the "Formula of Concord" (76 of part 2, article 4).<a name=316:4></a> The first says: "To obtain remission of sins is to be justified according to that [passage], <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#32">Psalm  32</a>.<a name=316:5></a>" And such is the uniform doctrine of the "Apology," which refutes the idea of any fulfilment of law having anything to say to it, contrasting law and promise, referring the last to Christ in contrast with the former.<a name=316:6></a> The "Formula of Concord" speaks thus: "We repudiate and condemn all the false doctrine which we will here recite.<a name=316:7></a>" The third doctrine condemned is: "That in the prophets' and apostles' sayings, where justification by faith is in question, the words 'to justify and to be justified' are not the same as 'to absolve and to be absolved from sins, and to obtain remission of sins.<a name=316:8></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		The conclusion I draw is, that the Homilies contradict, Calvin laboriously controverts, and the Lutheran body openly condemns, that special distinction which is made essential by the "Record" and the party it represents, and declared by it to be the faith of the whole Church of God; that the Reformed or Calvinistic part of Protestantism did speak of the fulfilling of the law by Christ for us -- that we may be considered as having fulfilled it in Him, but barely alludes to it as maintaining the law, and not at all as it is now taught; and that the Lutheran part of the Church rejects it altogether.<a name=316:9></a> I find, further, that there is no attempt to adduce scripture in proof of what they do state as to the law.<a name=316:10></a> The Westminster Confession speaks of Christ's obedience and death as a satisfaction, never of the law in justifying (chapter 8: 5; chapter 11: 1-3).<a name=316:11></a> Nor, when speaking of the law, does it speak of Christ's fulfilling it for us.<a name=316:12></a> The passages which it quotes are those in Romans, which exclude the law, and <a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#33">Jeremiah  33</a>and the like; though it says (what is foolish enough) that "God gave a law to Adam as a covenant of works, promising life upon the fulfilling (!<a name=316:13></a>), and threatening

		The other is, that we believers are not under law, but under grace; that Christ, while perfect under law in His own Person, did not keep it to make good our defects under it, or give us legal righteousness or justification by it; that He died for our sins, and thus put them away; but that we are viewed as being also dead with Him, and no longer in the flesh at all, to which law applied, but stand as risen in the presence of God, in the position in which He stands, with all the value of His work upon us, and accepted in His Person, according to His acceptance now that He is risen; that this is measured by His having perfectly glorified God in His work, and hence is glorified in and with God in heaven; and that this is our title to be in heaven and glory in due time with Him -- conformed to His image -- the firstborn among many brethren.<a name=318:1></a>

		Here is the importance of the matter.<a name=318:2></a> The first opinion makes our righteousness to be a righteousness under law, in flesh, connecting us with Christ's position before the cross, and making our righteousness purely legal, and putting us under the law; this being the measure and principle of it, we are justified by its being kept.<a name=318:3></a> "Do this and live.<a name=318:4></a>" The second holds us to be dead to that state of flesh under law altogether; that when Christ was in the body He stood alone, and that our standing in Him is as dead and risen, the old man entirely condemned, but crucified and dead for faith; we, alive to God in Christ, risen, delivered from the law, united to Christ <i>risen</i>, and rejoicing in hope of the glory of God, because Christ has perfectly glorified God in dying, and that our place is that of having entered into God's presence through the cross, that new and living way (that is, through death, by which it is all left behind, and all that related to flesh in its relationship with God, though in fact, having to contend with it as an enemy to be overcome).<a name=318:5></a> They put us behind the cross under law.<a name=318:6></a> God has put us by the cross, and as now crucified with Christ, alive in His presence, as risen with Him.<a name=318:7></a>

		Now, I will commence by stating that I hold the maintenance of the law, in its true and highest character, to be of the deepest importance, and necessary to a right and full apprehension of divine teaching.<a name=319:5></a> It is the abstract perfection of a creature, loving God with all our heart, and our neighbour as ourselves; and this Christ most surely did in all He did.<a name=319:6></a> All the moral claims and teaching of law and prophets, as the Lord declares, hang on it.<a name=319:7></a> And if angels suggest little the thought of a neighbour where God's presence fills all things, and He only, so to speak, is thought of, still, in a general way, though not under law, we can say that the angels surely do so.<a name=319:8></a> Love to God and to others governs them.<a name=319:9></a> Still, it is because the others are objects of God's love, God has a more exclusive place with them.<a name=319:10></a> For love to one another is not brought out as to them in scripture, as in man.<a name=319:11></a> Man's wants develop it; angels can much more think of God only.<a name=319:12></a> For us, at any rate, the maintaining this immutable standard abstractedly as our creature perfection is, I believe, of deep moral importance.<a name=319:13></a> To say that it was given to Adam with a promise of life, and reproduced at Sinai, is an idle, unscriptural imagination, and utter confusion as to the ways of God.<a name=319:14></a> There was no promise of life to Adam innocent; it would have been out of place.<a name=319:15></a> It is false, and only confusion.<a name=319:16></a> A law to love God does not suit innocence.<a name=319:17></a> Loving a neighbour was not suited to Adam's position; had he remained innocent, he never would have had any, but been the head and father of his race without a neighbour.<a name=319:18></a> The ten commandments suppose the knowledge of good and evil: to give a law to Adam which supposed it would have falsified his position.<a name=319:19></a> What did stealing mean for him?<a name=319:20></a> And, what is yet more important, what a prohibition to lust?<a name=319:21></a> Sinai does take the two great commandments as basis (that we know), but supposes lust, knowledge of good and evil, and sin, and prohibits it.<a name=319:22></a> Law is not made for the righteous, but for the unrighteous.<a name=319:23></a> That, Adam was not.<a name=319:24></a> He had a command which was a test of obedience, and no more -- a test by that which, save by prohibition, would have been as innocent

		But now comes the question.<a name=320:18></a> Man being a sinner, utterly departed from God, and if under law a law-breaker -- is the law a way of justifying him, or the rule according to which he is justified?<a name=320:19></a> Ah, if he has kept it all right, he shall surely have righteousness by it and life.<a name=320:20></a><a href="#320:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> But we have supposed with scripture that man is a sinner, and under law a law-breaker, so that he has not righteousness by it.<a name=320:21></a> How then does scripture bring in righteousness and salvation?<a name=320:22></a> Is it by law?<a name=320:23></a> Is it founded on its rules and claims?<a name=320:24></a> or is it, while surely maintaining the excellency and authority of the law fully, in some other way?<a name=320:25></a> Upon the ground of the first Adam in law, it is all over with us -- the way to the tree of life shut and all access forbidden.<a name=320:26></a> But from the outset what hope is given?<a name=320:27></a> It is another Adam, the seed of the woman, not a restoration of the first on any old principle.<a name=320:28></a> The seed of the woman is to bruise the serpent's head.<a name=320:29></a> The destruction of evil is by Christ's coming in as a deliverer.<a name=320:30></a>

		As this paper, from its length (which I regret and attribute to the haste with which it was composed in the midst of many avocations) could not appear in one number of the "Bible Treasury," I will add one or two remarks as to righteousness, and the use of this word in scripture.<a name=332:5></a> First, it is quite certain that in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3">Romans  3</a>righteousness means God's righteousness, as God in contrast with Christ's work, though displayed through and in virtue of it.<a name=332:6></a> It is the righteousness of God without law.<a name=332:7></a> This is its nature and quality.<a name=332:8></a> It is not man's, it is God's apart from law.<a name=332:9></a> Such is the constant use of the genitive.<a name=332:10></a> Next, it is the righteousness of God by faith of Jesus Christ.<a name=332:11></a> That is the way it is brought to bear on men in their favour.<a name=332:12></a> Then His passing over sins in times past seemed to deny this righteousness; but the death of Christ accounted for that.<a name=332:13></a> And so God's righteousness was, at <i>this time</i>, that He might be righteous and Justifier of them who believe in Jesus.<a name=332:14></a> Now the person whose righteousness is spoken of is the righteous justifier, that is, God.<a name=332:15></a> The way is faith in Jesus.<a name=332:16></a> I say, then, in this capital passage it is a character or attribute of God, which is made good by the blood of Christ, when it seemed to be impossible, in respect of sinners, so as to favour them.<a name=332:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The righteousness of God is His consistency with Himself.<a name=332:18></a> Hence it shews itself in mercy when it is promised, in judgment on the wicked, in rewarding integrity, not as merit, but as that which pleased Him, and rightly -- everything in which God makes good what He has revealed Himself to be.<a name=332:19></a> For in a certain sense He owes Himself to that, because withal it is Himself; and on this faith ought to reckon.<a name=332:20></a> Hence all the interventions of God in favour of His people, according to His revelation of Himself, or His promises, are called righteousness.<a name=332:21></a> Of course, His revelation of Himself is the truth of what He is: but this revelation is our only just way of knowing it.<a name=332:22></a> But it is a relative term.<a name=332:23></a> A person cannot be intrinsically righteousness (i.<a name=332:24></a>e.<a name=332:25></a>, without reference to someone else).<a name=332:26></a> Man's righteousness, if he had any, would be his consistency with the revelation of God and its requirements.<a name=332:27></a> "The righteous Lord loveth righteousness, his countenance doth behold the upright.<a name=332:28></a>" But

		man was not this.<a name=333:1></a> Hence, when the law had been given, mercy is always put before righteousness, because the saints felt, as the Spirit taught, that he had forfeited everything.<a name=333:2></a> It is from this sense of righteousness (God's consistency with Himself as revealed, His acting on the revelation of Himself) that it has been said to mean goodness, mercy, and the like.<a name=333:3></a> The display of it was such; the thing spoken of as displaying it was such.<a name=333:4></a> Still, it was God's consistency with Himself, and this is constantly appealed to in the Psalms, and declared to be "near" and to be "for ever" in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#51">Isaiah  51</a>, and connected with Israel's salvation when mercy and truth will be met together, righteousness and peace will kiss each other, and truth flourish out of the earth, and righteousness look down from heaven.<a name=333:5></a> So David speaks of bringing in everlasting righteousness amongst men when God manifests His glory, His perfect consistency with Himself, and blesses His people.<a name=333:6></a> The heavens will declare His righteousness, for God will be judge Himself; and the fruit of righteousness will be peace, and the effect of righteousness, quietness and assurance for ever.<a name=333:7></a> Thus righteousness will reign in the millennium, and peace and bliss be maintained.<a name=333:8></a> In the new heavens and the new earth the righteousness will dwell, and nothing can be changed; there is nothing to change.<a name=333:9></a>

		On the other hand, we read, "Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness.<a name=333:10></a>" Here the godly man looks for enlargement out of distress, according to God's consistency with His revelation of Himself -- the thing he looks to as the title to be helped, he walking in fear and faith.<a name=333:11></a> And the sacrifices of righteousness have the same force, sacrifices offered according to the true character in which God had revealed Himself (of course, in Israel, according to the law, but with the piety, purpose, and truth of heart which became this approach to God, and the consciousness of what He was).<a name=333:12></a> So, in the triumphant deliverance of His people at the end, it is righteousness sustains Him.<a name=333:13></a> He saw there was no man, but He was Himself, and He put it on as a breastplate, and made good His character against evil.<a name=333:14></a> And it is this which makes the perplexity of the saint in the Psalms who yet owns his sin.<a name=333:15></a> How was God's character made good when His people were oppressed, and not a promise fulfilled?<a name=333:16></a> Yet there is the confession of sin, and confidence in Him through grace.<a name=333:17></a> Integrity wrought in by grace calls on righteousness and expects an answer

	<div class="paragraph">
		But how could all this be made good, and God be really consistent with Himself, shew mercy, judge sin, bless faith and hope in Him according to promise?<a name=334:3></a> That was based on redemption, on Christ's work as made sin; and though there may be hope, the soul is never clear till this is known.<a name=334:4></a> Here God can be, yea, is, here alone is (now sin is come in), consistent with Himself in blessing.<a name=334:5></a> Thus He could righteously bless according to promise.<a name=334:6></a> "Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made to the fathers" -- and that effectually, only through death and resurrection.<a name=334:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there was much more than this in Christ's death.<a name=334:8></a> God, independently of promise, was perfectly glorified in all He is -- righteousness, love, truth, majesty -- in all He is.<a name=334:9></a> Hence a ground of righteousness is laid for every sinner.<a name=334:10></a> God is consistent with -- glorifies -- Himself in blessing.<a name=334:11></a> I do not mean that this was all; for it was not -- there was positive substitution for the redeemed; but I confine myself now to the one point.<a name=334:12></a> Thus the Gentiles, who had no promise, could glorify God for His mercy.<a name=334:13></a> Whoever believed had a part in it.<a name=334:14></a> God was righteous in blessing him -- just in forgiving.<a name=334:15></a> Hence grace reigned, but reigned through righteousness, Jew and Gentile, when the matter was fully looked into, being all alike.<a name=334:16></a> God did and will make good His promises, but by nature all were children of wrath.<a name=334:17></a> There was no difference.<a name=334:18></a> It was, through Christ, God's righteousness unto all; and it is upon all them that believe.<a name=334:19></a>

		This is Paul's great theme in the Romans: to the end of chapter 3, the death which made it good; from chapter 4 to the end of chapter 8, the position into which we are righteously brought in resurrection, the sure place which this glorifying of God has obtained for us, and which He righteously puts into, and must, so to speak, in Christ; and then (chapters 9-11) the apostle meets the objection of special promise.<a name=334:20></a> He had only discussed law as yet with the Jew; and the Jew could say, Yes; but what about our special promises?<a name=334:21></a> And his answer is, God is sovereign; or, else, if you rest it on fleshly descent, you must let in Ishmael and Esau; and God will use this sovereignty to let in Gentiles.<a name=334:22></a> You have forfeited all by seeking it by law, and stumbling at the stumbling-stone.<a name=334:23></a> And <a name=335>[Page 335]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus, though God did make good His character revealed to the Jew, and His promise, yet that was not a partial thing.<a name=335:5></a> The cross must reveal deeper truth, and, displayed in all its perfectness and grace, what God was in Himself; and thus dealt with the sinner as such, with what man was in himself, that is, nothing but sin, and brought him, through faith in Jesus, according to the value of that sacrifice, into the presence of God Himself in heaven.<a name=335:6></a> The Jews, as a nation, must wait till the great High Priest comes out to know the sacrifice is accepted.<a name=335:7></a> Then they will be blessed.<a name=335:8></a> To them that believe the Holy Ghost is come out, while Christ is within; and we know that He is, and are at peace, and that according to righteousness.<a name=335:9></a> Grace reigns through righteousness.<a name=335:10></a>

		Of course, in an article or a tract, I can only sketch the scriptural use of this word.<a name=335:11></a> The reader has only to take a concordance and see how far it is just.<a name=335:12></a> I have no doubt the New Testament, as would naturally be the case, alludes to several of these passages.<a name=335:13></a> I rather think <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#50">Psalm  50</a>was in the apostle's mind in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3">Romans  3</a>, or that which the Spirit had produced by it in his mind.<a name=335:14></a> Thus, too, the remarkable passages in <a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#23">Jeremiah  23</a>and <a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#33">Jeremiah  33</a>, "the Lord our righteousness" -- the first said of Christ, the second of Jerusalem.<a name=335:15></a> As Christ is righteousness to us, and we are the righteousness of God in Him, we are accepted, according to God's own character, righteously, in Him.<a name=335:16></a> His infinite value, including therein His work, is our title before God.<a name=335:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another point it will be well to clear up from scripture.<a name=335:18></a> How is eternal life obtained?<a name=335:19></a> We are told, by law-keeping.<a name=335:20></a> I deny it.<a name=335:21></a> A law was not given which could give life; Christ had, or rather was, eternal life before He kept law.<a name=335:22></a> Eternal life is not obtained by law-keeping.<a name=335:23></a> What says the scripture?<a name=335:24></a> The subject is one of deep importance.<a name=335:25></a> Justification being one aspect of salvation, the other part of it, so to speak, is eternal life.<a name=335:26></a> The direct doctrine of scripture is as plain as possible.<a name=335:27></a> That I shall state.<a name=335:28></a> The Jews had connected it with the law, as they had righteousness.<a name=335:29></a> This connection will require more attention than the simple truth

		itself.<a name=336:1></a> The Lord, while presenting Himself to their responsibility during His lifetime, speaks in a guarded way upon it.<a name=336:2></a> Once rejected (and He is so viewed all through the gospel of John), all is distinct and simple.<a name=336:3></a> The notion of our getting life by His law-keeping, is not only not found in scripture, but is contrary to every idea the gospel gives of it.<a name=336:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us first state from scripture the simple truth on the subject.<a name=336:5></a> The simplest, fullest, and most direct statements of what eternal life is, are to be found, perhaps, in John's first epistle (the main object of the whole Epistle being to shew what that life is).<a name=336:6></a> "That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life; for the life was manifested, and we have seen and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us.<a name=336:7></a>" Here we have eternal life, erst with the Father, but manifested in the Person of Christ.<a name=336:8></a> So in the last chapter: "This is the record, that God hath given unto us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.<a name=336:9></a> He that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.<a name=336:10></a>" "He is the true God, and eternal life.<a name=336:11></a>" This, then, is most definite and distinct.<a name=336:12></a> The life is in the Son.<a name=336:13></a> He is eternal life.<a name=336:14></a> So the gospel: "In him was life, and the life was the light of men.<a name=336:15></a>" "As the Father hath life in himself, so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#5">John  5</a>).<a name=336:16></a> He is a life-giving Spirit; He quickens whom He will.<a name=336:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All this is plain.<a name=336:18></a> Life is in the Son, or He is life.<a name=336:19></a> He has it in His Person; He communicates it.<a name=336:20></a> It is given of God, not won.<a name=336:21></a> "The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:23">Romans  6:23</a>).<a name=336:22></a> "I," says Christ of His sheep, "am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.<a name=336:23></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may now see <i>how</i> it is obtained.<a name=336:24></a> It is the Spirit working by the word.<a name=336:25></a> We are born of the Spirit; and "of his own will begat he us by the word of truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures" (<a href="../bible/James.htm#1:18">James  1:18</a>).<a name=336:26></a> Hence <a href="../bible/John.htm#5:24">John  5:24</a>: "He that heareth my words, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment, but is passed from death unto life.<a name=336:27></a>" So Paul's witness was "a savour of life unto life, or of death unto death.<a name=336:28></a>" The form or character of this is resurrection.<a name=336:29></a> "If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.<a name=336:30></a> For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.<a name=336:31></a> When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory" (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3:1">Colossians  3:1</a>,3,4.<a name=336:32></a> This and verse 20 depend on chapter 2: 12,13.<a name=336:33></a>)

		We have yet a particular point to enquire into historically (for the doctrine of eternal life is clear) -- how far the Jews thought of this, and how far Christ met their thoughts.<a name=338:8></a> The doctrine of eternal life or any life after this world was not necessary to be a good Jew.<a name=338:9></a> The priests and high priests were Sadducees, who believed nothing of it.<a name=338:10></a> It is said that Sadoc's teaching originally was only urging that rewards after this life ought not to be our motive for goodness, but the blessedness of what was good.<a name=338:11></a> However that may be, it ended in his followers denying resurrection, angel, and spirit, and taking this world for their portion.<a name=338:12></a> But, while the Pentateuch is silent as to eternal life, saying only, "The man that doeth these things shall live in them," the subsequent teaching of the Jews had brought the nation, with the exception of the Sadducees, to expect eternal life, with the grossest corruption of principles as to merit, balancing accounts of merit and demerit, and even positive superstitions.<a name=338:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		that the theory that pardon and justification are distinct things, and that a man may be pardoned but not justified is the universal doctrine of the Church of God, is ignorance of history.<a name=341:1></a> The contrary is stated by the Homilies and Calvin, and the thought is formally condemned by the Lutheran symbolical books as false doctrine.<a name=341:2></a> It is not the doctrine taught at the Reformation, but the contrary.<a name=341:3></a> The "Record" moves here in the narrow circle of its own associates.<a name=341:4></a> Next, I do not accept, more than the "Record" does, that justification is limited by that.<a name=341:5></a> A man <i>is</i> justified by blood -- that is, by the blood of Christ.<a name=341:6></a> Scripture, as Calvin insists, is express upon it.<a name=341:7></a> But when the "Record" would correct the absolute limitation of justification to pardon, it goes back instead of forward, and makes us justified before we are pardoned -- justified, before Christ dies for us, by Christ's law-keeping before the cross.<a name=341:8></a> Here it is all wrong again.<a name=341:9></a> Scripture repudiates righteousness by law for man altogether, and declares, if it be on this ground, Christ is dead in vain, and that we are fallen from grace.<a name=341:10></a> The "Record" does not see the extent to which we are dead and condemned, and thus puts us under law and leaves us to make out our justification by a completing unfailing law-keeping by Christ's perfect law-keeping; so that it is a work which goes on, the application of this righteousness being progressive and proportioned to my failures.<a name=341:11></a> It denies the value of law, which counts the breaker of one commandment guilty of all, and the existence of one lust sufficient to damn.<a name=341:12></a> It is an allowance of failure in keeping the law when put under it; for a perfect obedience, not atonement, is provided beforehand.<a name=341:13></a> And the apostle's answer to this they have not got.<a name=341:14></a> He replies, Yes; but you are dead and risen again.<a name=341:15></a> How can you live in flesh when you are dead?<a name=341:16></a> But no such argument applies to law.<a name=341:17></a> Historically, the "Record" is totally wrong.<a name=341:18></a> When it goes beyond the defect it condemns, it goes back to law, instead of forward in the power of resurrection into Christ.<a name=341:19></a> Let those who search the scriptures (and I beseech Christians to do it, and not satisfy themselves with my rapid and imperfect sketch of the truth for a periodical) say whether law or resurrection is the ground on which the apostle -- on which the Spirit of God -- sets us in the word for justification before God, for life and acceptance in Christ.<a name=341:20></a>

		Pardon and justification are not the same thing.<a name=342:4></a> Pardon is the favour and kindness of a person wronged passing over faults against himself, an act of prerogative goodness; so that kindness flows forth unimpeded by the wrong -- though in this case it be by the blood of Christ.<a name=342:5></a> Justification is the holding not chargeable with guilt.<a name=342:6></a> The latter refers to righteous judgment; the former, to kindness.<a name=342:7></a> Where one is a sinner against God, they approach one another, and run together in fact, but are not the same, nor in the effect the same in the heart.<a name=342:8></a> Justified, I do not fear judgment; pardoned, my heart returns in comfort to Him who has pardoned me; but by His blood we have both.<a name=342:9></a> It is another aspect, not another act.<a name=342:10></a> So, when we connect our risen position with justifying, it is not logically exact.<a name=342:11></a> The justifying is always holding discharged from accusation.<a name=342:12></a> The way in which we so stand is not simply holding us to be clear, but by the resurrection of Christ putting us into a new position; for if He be risen, and God has acknowledged therein the satisfaction made in Christ's death, He has therein discharged or justified us.<a name=342:13></a> But that which justified us implies, therefore, more than pardon, an introduction into God's presence as Christ stands there.<a name=342:14></a> If Christ be not raised, we are yet in our sins; but if He be, we are cleared by a work which brings us into the glory of God in perfect acceptance.<a name=342:15></a> This is not properly justification, but it is the justification we have got, seeing how we have obtained the justification; for we are justified by being the righteousness of God in Him, and are warranted practically in taking what Christ is as the measure of our justification, because it is that which will be recognized in the day of judgment.<a name=342:16></a> "Herein is love made perfect with us, that we should have boldness in the day of judgment; because, as he is, so are we in this world.<a name=342:17></a>" The day of judgment pronounces on us.<a name=342:18></a> We are as the Judge -- clearly justified therefore.<a name=342:19></a> But the Lamb is the Judge too: we appear before Him who bore our sins; so

		As to <a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#1">2 Peter  1</a>I still think also it is nothing to the purpose.<a name=346:13></a> It is not imputed righteousness here, nor anything to do with it, nor a righteousness presented to God (Christ's righteousness, as men speak in this sense), but a righteousness exercised by God in virtue of which they got Christianity, or the precious faith.<a name=346:14></a> It was not a righteousness accepted, but a righteousness of God, which gave according to promise, and revealed grace.<a name=346:15></a> And so the English translators understood it, and, I have no doubt at all, rightly.<a name=346:16></a> I do not know that I have any subject of controversy with Mr.<a name=346:17></a> Harrison, and I have no wish to have any.<a name=346:18></a> I think he runs a little into inherent righteousness, or is in danger of it -- i.<a name=346:19></a>e.<a name=346:20></a>, Wesleyanism; and I think he has not yet at all understood our position in Christ risen, as something else than His dying for us, though the fruit of it.<a name=346:21></a> I trust he will believe that I say this with no assumption, nor as a reproach, and that he will weigh it in the spirit I say it in; for I am quite ready to believe him more faithful to the light he has than I am.<a name=346:22></a> But still I think there is truth in scripture on this subject which he has not received.<a name=346:23></a>

		My Dear Brother, <br>I have read the paper which you gave me, and which I understand is so much thought of by Christians of the Establishment.<a name=349:1></a> We are so apt, in getting hold of some truth, to pursue our own reasonings on it (reasonings in which, in divine things, there may be so easily some error or defect, some positive text forgotten that would shew the defect, or with which the conclusion is at variance), that it is important to review all one's assertions and statements, and compare them with God's word; and search that word that we may, in our measure, fully know all its teaching on any point, so as to be guarded against any self-drawn conclusion which may more or less swerve from it.<a name=349:2></a> At least, so I find it.<a name=349:3></a>

		"And the language used by the apostle shews that it is coincident with the Person of Christ and found in Him.<a name=365:1></a> This is evident from the way in which he speaks of one of those terms which describe the one obedience of Christ in its manifoldness of its effects and benefits.<a name=365:2></a> When he says that the redemption is 'in Christ Jesus,' the meaning is, that it is found in His Person; that He is personally the redemption, just as He is called our peace (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2:14">Ephesians  2:14</a>).<a name=365:3></a>" (There, too, note the reconciliation is made (verse 16) solely by the cross having slain the enmity thereby, which is wholly dropped here), and is "furthermore described as made of God unto us righteousness (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:30">1 Corinthians  1:30</a>).<a name=365:4></a> It does not denote that we have it in a state of union to His Person, however true that is in itself but that it is actually IN Him, that He is Himself that manifested righteousness, and will continue to be so while His living Person endures.<a name=365:5></a> The Judge, then, sees our righteousness and our eternal redemption whenever He looks upon the Person of Christ.<a name=365:6></a> The living Redeemer, in His crucified and risen humanity, is Himself the manifestation of the righteousness of God; and it must not be lost sight of that He is living through death according to the power of an endless life (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#7:16">Hebrews  7:16</a>), and the restoration of life to appear in the presence of God was essentially necessary to the existence, validity, and perpetuity of this righteousness "of God" (not, it seems, His laying it down or being a sacrifice for sin).<a name=365:7></a> "It is, therefore, no putative, past, or transitory righteousness that has been manifested; but one actually in the world, and the only great reality in it.<a name=365:8></a> Thus, when the righteous Judge beholds His Son, He sees in Him the righteousness of God, the grand re-adjustment of man's relation to his Maker, the re-union of God and man.<a name=365:9></a>"

		Now I could hardly conceive anything which could shew more distinctly the true character of this interpretation of the righteousness of God than the passage I have quoted: -- justification without blood-shedding, no wrath -- such a sense of justice would imply an incensed God; redemption by incarnation, in the Person of Christ, without blood-shedding; righteousness manifested, brought in once for all as an historic fact in the incarnation, only in the accomplishment of law, as we read (page 39); peace found in His Person, not through His blood; Christ as righteousness, the re-adjustment of man's relationship to his Maker, the re-union of God and man.<a name=365:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And all this (and it might be greatly enlarged upon) is not because he is not speaking of the death of Christ; for he takes care to say it must not be lost sight of, because this righteousness of God was to be manifested in His crucified and risen humanity.<a name=366:7></a> His account of this is "His living through death, according to the power of an endless life" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#7:16">Hebrews  7:16</a>).<a name=366:8></a> And "the restoration of life to appear in the presence of God for us was essentially necessary to the existence, validity, and perpetuity of this righteousness of God.<a name=366:9></a>" My soul, come not thou into their assembly!<a name=366:10></a> I cannot conceive a more complete, deliberate, careful setting aside of the necessity, value, and true sufferings of Christ's death, viewed as atonement, as a victim -- a propitiation for sins, as bearing our sins in His own body on the tree, as One who drank that dreadful cup of wrath.<a name=366:11></a> Death, as death for sin, is wholly gone, not lost sight of, but set aside by language which slights the agonies of the Son of God.<a name=366:12></a>

		This leads me to another remark, which shews how carefully, as I have said, Christ's expiatory sufferings are set aside here.<a name=367:2></a> The curse of the law is diligently spoken of.<a name=367:3></a> Christ came under the law as violated.<a name=367:4></a> "If law is the sphere of this righteousness, it is evident that no knowledge can be acquired respecting it without a clear conception of the law in its relation to sinners, not only in respect to its positive claims, but in the extent of its curse.<a name=367:5></a>" Here, surely, if anywhere, we should find "Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us, for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree.<a name=367:6></a>" Not a word of it is found.<a name=367:7></a> All the unfathomable truth of the Holy One being made sin for us must be set aside.<a name=367:8></a> Not only so, but an entirely different view of the curse, or meeting the curse, of the law is given I will give the whole passage, that I may not be charged with misstating it.<a name=367:9></a> He continues: "The law to which the surety must needs subject himself was, moreover, the LAW AS VIOLATED,<a href="#367:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> urging the unalterable demands which it made on man as man, and armed with the curse its violation entailed.<a name=367:10></a><a href="#367:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a> Accordingly, the work of Christ is described in its relation to the law.<a name=367:11></a> He was made under the law (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#4:4">Galatians  4:4</a>); the righteousness on which man's acceptance is based is termed the righteousness of the law (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:4">Romans  8:4</a>); the work of Christ is the end of the law for (or unto) righteousness to every one that believeth (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#10:4">Romans  10:4</a>).<a name=367:12></a> This latter phrase <i>(telos nomou)</i> can only mean that fulfilment which the law demanded, and could not but demand, till its end or accomplishment was reached; and that additional word, that Christ is the end of it 'unto righteousness' <i>(eis)</i>, leaves no doubt that this fulfilment of the law is to be found m Christ, and is received in the reception of Christ.<a name=367:13></a>" As yet we cannot find a word of the curse, only of fulfilling the law, which, I suppose, did not bring a curse.<a name=367:14></a> I continue: "More particularly the obedience of Christ (called <i>upakoe)</i> (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:19">Romans  5:19</a>) extended over His entire life, and formed one obedience from first to last.<a name=367:15></a>"

		Now, I ask any Christian reader whether, as we have seen the expiatory value of Christ's death, and justification, and redemption through blood omitted and denied, so the being made a curse for those under the curse of the law, as hanging on the tree -- that unfathomable truth of scripture -- is not here wholly set aside?<a name=368:11></a> -- spoken of, but set aside?<a name=368:12></a> If Christ is made a curse at all in this system, it was by birth.<a name=368:13></a> He was born under the curse; but if it be that, there is not one word of it.<a name=368:14></a> He kept the law, was obedient, and that is righteousness.<a name=368:15></a> What scripture speaks of as the curse is set aside.<a name=368:16></a> The world's new creation is before His death and resurrection: His keeping the law on earth was this.<a name=368:17></a> This I will touch on hereafter.<a name=368:18></a>

		I have now to shew how, as to law, he contradicts himself and the scripture, and then see what he says of righteousness, and how scripture speaks of it.<a name=369:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, as to law, he contradicts himself.<a name=369:8></a> "The fact that it is commonly put in contrast to 'our own righteousness' (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#10:3">Romans  10:3</a>); that 'our own' is said to be of the law, as compared with that which is 'of God' (<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3:9">Philippians  3:9</a>); and that it is furthermore called 'a gift of righteousness' (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:17">Romans  5:17</a>), determines the significance of the term to be something widely different from the divine attribute on the one hand, or a work of law on the other.<a name=369:9></a>" .<a name=369:10></a>.<a name=369:11></a>.<a name=369:12></a> "This is, however, abhorrent to the divine rectitude, which insists on a true fulfilment of the divine law?<a name=369:13></a> and acquits only on account of an actual obedience.<a name=369:14></a>" This, as an abstract or absolute statement, is simply nonsense.<a name=369:15></a> An actual obedience does not need an acquittal.<a name=369:16></a> It is contrary to scripture, for we are justified by blood.<a name=369:17></a> But to pursue.<a name=369:18></a> It is obvious that, in the government of a righteous God, no one can be justified by a mere connivance at defects, or by being accounted what he is not.<a name=369:19></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This last, he says, is a legal fiction -- the believer must be really righteous when he is declared so.<a name=369:20></a> All this is muddy enough.<a name=369:21></a> If it means anything, the man must himself be what he is held to be, which denies the whole truth of vicarious work and of believing on Him who justifies the ungodly.<a name=369:22></a> And it is quite clear that, if Christ has kept the law, and I am counted righteous, that is a legal fiction.<a name=369:23></a> His having borne my sin and put it away is no fiction: my sin has been dealt with.<a name=369:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I return to the contradiction of the writer.<a name=369:25></a> "The standard or measure of this righteousness of God is divine justice and the law.<a name=369:26></a>" Yet it is not a work of law which is the significance of the term!<a name=369:27></a> And a man, if righteous, must be righteous according to the measure of the law, and only on account of actual obedience, yet "it is not a work of law!<a name=369:28></a>" Yet, again, it is the accomplishment of law.<a name=369:29></a>" How true is the apostle, "desiring to be teachers of the law, they know not what they say nor whereof they affirm!<a name=369:30></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=370>[Page 370]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But if I turn to scripture, I find the whole system of its doctrines in direct opposition to our righteousness having anything to do with law.<a name=370:1></a> Whatever the contradictions, the doctrine of the paper is, that the accomplishment of the law is righteousness -- that fulfilment which the law demanded.<a name=370:2></a> Now, I affirm that what is demanded now is, that I should be fit for the presence of God in heaven, fit for the glory of God, fit to see His face: that the only goal is "the resurrection from among the dead," and that we are risen with Christ; and that this, consequent on the death of Christ, is our standing before God.<a name=370:3></a> But it is better to answer directly -- in vain, almost, to quote the positive declarations of our death and resurrection in Christ.<a name=370:4></a> They will have legal righteousness for children of Adam alive in the flesh.<a name=370:5></a> I will therefore turn to their own ground.<a name=370:6></a> Is righteousness by the law?<a name=370:7></a> That is the question.<a name=370:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, scripture speaks on this head: let us hear it.<a name=370:9></a> If righteousness come by the law, Christ is dead in vain.<a name=370:10></a> No matter who kept it, it was not to come by the law.<a name=370:11></a> And mark two things: first, Christ's death is what comes in contrast with it; secondly, This one grand foundation of Christianity is all in vain, if righteousness comes by the law.<a name=370:12></a> "That no man is justified by the law, is evident: for the just shall live by faith.<a name=370:13></a> But the law is not of faith.<a name=370:14></a>" The nature of the righteousness is different.<a name=370:15></a> So, in a remarkable verse, it is said, "Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.<a name=370:16></a>" It will be said, But it means, not by our own doing these works, but by Christ doing them; and then we believe in Him, and this is held as our doing them.<a name=370:17></a> But this is being justified by the works of the law: Christ has done them and I am thereby justified.<a name=370:18></a> Only this is what is rejected by the author as "a legal fiction"; next, it is "putative" righteousness, which he equally rejects.<a name=370:19></a> It is not the man's actually being righteous, but accounted what he is not.<a name=370:20></a> "They have fulfilled it (we are told) in a Representative, with whom they are one.<a name=370:21></a>" But the passage allows of nothing of this.<a name=370:22></a> It puts not merely my sin and works in contrast with the deeds of the law, but it puts the faith of Christ in contrast with works of law.<a name=370:23></a> "Christ received by faith establishes the law," says the writer.<a name=370:24></a> "By the faith of Christ," says the apostle, "not by the works of the law.<a name=370:25></a>"

		By the law he was dead to the law that he might live to God.<a name=371:1></a> It is perfectly impossible for any person to read <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:15">Galatians  2:15</a> to the end, and chapters 3 and 4, without seeing that works of law, in every shape and in every way, are rejected as the means of righteousness; and that a statement that Christ has done them, and that thereby we are righteous, is incompatible with the statements of this part of scripture.<a name=371:2></a> The idea of Christ keeping the law for us is never made the object of faith in scripture; nor is it said, that He kept it for our righteousness.<a name=371:3></a> Man has said it; scripture does not.<a name=371:4></a> If it does, let the text be produced.<a name=371:5></a> When He is said to be made under it, it is said that it was that He might redeem those who were under it.<a name=371:6></a>

		I turn, then, from the question of the righteousness of God to the application of it, and what we are to understand by righteousness and by imputing it.<a name=376:18></a> We have already seen that righteousness is the maintaining what is due to our relationship with others.<a name=376:19></a> In this general expression of it, it has its double expression of being it in our conduct, or securing it by judgment, in which, in English, it is more commonly called justice.<a name=376:20></a> It is thus always relative, though it is practically employed for the conduct which maintains this consistency with the relationship.<a name=376:21></a> It is thus used also for the condition in which I stand towards another who has a claim, in virtue of my conduct.<a name=376:22></a> I am righteous in God's sight, righteous before Him.<a name=376:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two points here.<a name=377:18></a> First, abstractedly, I am held to be righteous (that is, to have no failure in the relationship in which I stand, to be perfect in it, that it has been perfectly maintained).<a name=377:19></a> I am accounted righteous.<a name=377:20></a> When I inquire what and how it is, I say, I am as an ungodly person so accounted; I am, as risen in Christ, in this perfect acceptance of delight.<a name=377:21></a> But it is by a work which would never have had its character, if it had not been about sinners, and by Christ being made sin.<a name=377:22></a> Here it was all divine perfections were brought out, as they could not be to angels.<a name=377:23></a> It is in this I am justified.<a name=377:24></a> Hence it is by faith, and according to the perfections of God so revealed and glorified.<a name=377:25></a> I have it as a sinner.<a name=377:26></a> Bring in any righteousness in me, any law-keeping, so that I am not
