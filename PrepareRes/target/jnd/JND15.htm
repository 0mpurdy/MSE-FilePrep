		REMARKS ON A TRACT CIRCULATED BY THE IRVINGITES ENTITLED, "A WORD OF INSTRUCTION"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The tract on which the following remarks have been made was actually circulated by the Irvingite teachers amongst those for whose sakes they have been written.<a name=1:1></a> Although therefore they would elude the responsibility flowing from it by saying that it is not put out by authority, they may justly be held answerable for its contents.<a name=1:2></a> It is perhaps right it should be known, that the only thing which has such authority among them, which they call the record, is kept carefully from the knowledge and hearing of any but themselves.<a name=1:3></a> If their individual teachers say anything, they are not answerable for it, for they are not the Holy Ghost.<a name=1:4></a> If the Spirit said plain things early in their course, it was before the ordinances were set up; though one of their angels has asserted, that, if he taught palpable error, no one was to call it in question, for the sin it might occasion would rest upon him; yet, when any one might shew the unscripturalness of the statement, then an individual was not the Church nor the Holy Ghost.<a name=1:5></a> And if the Spirit spoke things which actually failed, then it was said no one had a right to interpret what was said, for no prophecy was of private interpretation.<a name=1:6></a> This, connected with the denial of the competency of individuals to use scripture with profit alone, or any way but through their ordinances, gives a character to this matter with which we are but too familiar in this country.<a name=1:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This has gone so far as for their teachers to assert, in their stating what has been mentioned and being questioned, that if they taught that God was not manifest in the flesh at all, a Christian ought not to look to the scriptures to see if it was right, and that if he did, he would get no good out of it, for he had not the Spirit so as to be able, and none had but they.<a name=1:8></a> And, in another instance of a person in illness, they were reproved on being found reading the bible, and saying it was their only comfort there alone, for that the Church was between their soul and God; and they have gone so far as to desire some poor disciples not to pray for anything they were not taught by the angel to pray for, for it was making God a familiar spirit.<a name=1:9></a> They would commend the bible

		perhaps highly; but take it as the rule of faith which a believer is capable of using for himself, however he may benefit by others, and by which he is always bound to judge others when the occasion arises; and they will -- perhaps I should not say they will -- but they have constantly denied such competency, and reproved such use.<a name=2:1></a> The authority of the Church and the voice with them is the paramount thing.<a name=2:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a painful thing to be mingled up with evil, even in contention against it; but it is sometimes the duty of, because needful for, the saints.<a name=2:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The people called Irvingites have been plainly convicted elsewhere of so much false doctrine, false practice, and false prophecy, and that by many of the Church of God, as to make it, when known, a question only of preserving God's children against the deceits and crafts of Satan.<a name=2:4></a> Here they are as strangers less known.<a name=2:5></a> It is not my intention to go over at length in this what has been already often taken notice of.<a name=2:6></a> They have here circulated one of their most plausible tracts; and therefore there is a plain ground to take up with them -- and I do this the rather for this reason -- they have been often charged with holding the sinful humanity of Christ, and many of their teachers and disciples have, to the writer of this and to other persons, avowed it -- that He had the carnal mind, but kept it down or dead.<a name=2:7></a> Mr.<a name=2:8></a> Irving, bold and fearless in the statement of what he held, declared that his nature bristled with sin like quills upon a porcupine; and that the nature with which the Son of man was clothed poured forth from the <i>centre of its inmost will</i> streams as black as hell; and that the Augean stable of this nature was given Him to cleanse; and, what was most material, the spirit which they profess to be the Holy Ghost, though it might not sanction the language, <i>expressly sanctioned the doctrine</i>, the doctrine to which it gave its sanction being, that the law of sin was there all-present.<a name=2:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this was so plainly wicked and evil, and contrary to God's word and Spirit, that they have, since they have been pressed with it, taken great pains, at least the subtler ones amongst them, to disclaim and deny this.<a name=2:10></a> I say the subtler ones; because it has been not long since avowed by some of their teachers to the writer of this.<a name=2:11></a> The way they have got over the Spirit's having sanctioned it is, that they were not answerable for what was said, that is, in utterance by the Spirit, before the ordinances were set up.<a name=2:12></a> One of these very ordinances said to the writer of this, that the Spirit might have said it through prejudice to please Mr.<a name=2:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Irving.<a name=3:1></a> I only mention this to shew the unhappy degradation to which men may be reduced by giving way to the leadings of an evil spirit.<a name=3:2></a> Another of their teachers confessed that damnable errors and blasphemous heresies had been taught by them at Cork and elsewhere.<a name=3:3></a> But few are aware of these, and many other, wretched inconsistencies which pass among them, and often tear the mind of those who are sincere among them: but who, having once given credit to the voice amongst them as the Holy Ghost, and submitted implicitly to the ordinances among them as the Church, are powerless in their hands, unless and until God, in His sovereign mercy, break the bands.<a name=3:4></a> And derangement and heart-breaking more than once have I known the fruit, while the testimony of those freed has been at once most sad and humbling as to what was there, though at first there may have been great form of joy and holiness.<a name=3:5></a> I say form; for, while there was that, it has never been heavenly or holy in its character or effects, where I have met with it, but the contrary: though I believe some holy persons have fallen into it.<a name=3:6></a> Deceit, worldliness, the sanction of evil tempers in those whose persons are held in admiration among them, along with the pretence of infallibility and the evil connected with that, are what I have met amongst them; nor, I may say, have I ever in any body of persons found such an entire want of truth, and so much subtlety and deceivableness.<a name=3:7></a> These may seem hard sayings, but I say them soberly, after painful and sorrowful discovery of it; for there are individuals among them whom I feel bound to believe are, and to love, and whom I do love clearly as, Christ's sheep.<a name=3:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the tract which I have here noticed is one which most anxiously denies, and guards itself against, the evil doctrine noticed above; and having been actually circulated by them, there can be no charge of aggravation or prejudice, if subtlety, deceit, and real dishonour to our blessed Lord, be found to characterize it.<a name=3:9></a> But the real value of their attempt to screen themselves from the charge of this unholy and wicked doctrine may be seen, and what the value of their most direct and plausible denial of it is.<a name=3:10></a> To those who are acquainted with their teaching, as one of the pillars of their angels (such is his title) said to the writer -- "a totally different gospel," which it surely is, and another foundation.<a name=3:11></a> There are many passages in the tract whose evil and subtlety would be most plain, but I can notice only such here as would be plain to a stranger on the face of it; and I say that those who really know Christ must at once reject them altogether.<a name=3:12></a> The

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will state their own words, to give them the full value of their denial of the doctrine.<a name=4:2></a> For though several have confessed it to me and others, they do often openly deny it when charged with it.<a name=4:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"In His [Christ's] human nature there was no inclination to sin, no stirring, no motion towards it, for He was dead to sin, being in humanity, as entirely and absolutely holy as Godhead is holy, and pure as Godhead is pure, so that, in the fullest sense in which the words can be taken, He could not sin.<a name=4:4></a>" "But," the tract justly adds, "in knowing this we are not knowing all.<a name=4:5></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Who would not say to this, What can be more satisfactory?<a name=4:6></a> So it might seem at first sight to the unwary, and those who knew not with whom they had to deal.<a name=4:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But first you must remark the terms, "He was dead to sin.<a name=4:8></a>" It is not in that He died, He died to sin once; therefore reckon yourselves, who have it in your nature, to be dead indeed unto sin.<a name=4:9></a> But while alive in the flesh He was so.<a name=4:10></a> Where was the sin He was dead to?<a name=4:11></a> They will tell you, at least they have told and written, in the nature He took, but not in His person.<a name=4:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, who would say that being holy in humanity did not mean His humanity being holy -- or think in so plain a statement of so subtle a distinction?<a name=4:13></a> Hear their own words in this very tract.<a name=4:14></a> "All holiness since the fall has been a thing <i>not according to,<a href="#4:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a></i> but <i>against, nature</i> .<a name=4:15></a><i>.<a name=4:16></a>.<a name=4:17></a> </i>.<a name=4:18></a> Now this is what I mean, by <i>regeneration holiness</i> -- not a holiness of humanity, but a holiness in humanity by the Holy Ghost.<a name=4:19></a> Such has been the holiness of all the saints of God -- of Abel, Enoch, Noah, etc.<a name=4:20></a>, Samuel, and the prophets.<a name=4:21></a> And such was the holiness of Him who is not ashamed to call those saints His brethren.<a name=4:22></a> I know that our beloved Lord was holy from the beginning, but this by no means alters the matter.<a name=4:23></a>" It was then a holiness not according to, but against nature.<a name=4:24></a> We can now understand what His being dead to sin means, and in humanity holy.<a name=4:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This might be sufficient to shew their exceeding subtlety; and how little those not acquainted with their teaching can trust apparently satisfactory statements; but as it is wrought out through all the tract I will follow it through some of the passages it contains.<a name=4:26></a> And I only ask, whether this subtlety is the least like the guilelessness of the Spirit of Christ.<a name=4:27></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The consequences they draw in this very tract are most plain.<a name=5:1></a> It is a difference in degree merely, that of Christ's holiness and ours, not in kind.<a name=5:2></a> It can be realized in the members as in the head.<a name=5:3></a> The difference between the head and members existed between the members, but not to the same degree.<a name=5:4></a> Dwelling in the Father and the Father in Him meant abiding ever in the Father by faith, and having the Father abiding in Him by the Holy Ghost, and that He had not the fulness of the Spirit without a correspondent waiting on the Father, and we are to do likewise: and consequently, as the prince of this world came and found nothing in our head, he would find nothing in us either, if we only were, as our head desires to see us, filled with all the fulness of God.<a name=5:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now all this really sets aside the person of Christ, and states sin to be in Christ in the flesh, or asserts that it may be out of ours, and both these latter points have been expressly taught to the writer, and Mr.<a name=5:6></a> Irving's printed doctrine was that Christ's work was not reconciling individuals, but human nature.<a name=5:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"If His human nature," says Mr.<a name=5:8></a> Irving in another place, "differed by however so little from ours in its alienation and guiltiness, then the reducing it into eternal harmony with God hath no bearing whatever upon our nature, with which it is not the same.<a name=5:9></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And that it was "of the substance and essence of the orthodox faith that Christ could say, till the resurrection, Not I but sin that tempteth me in my flesh.<a name=5:10></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He said also, that Christ suffered because He was in the condition of a sinner: and that if He were not, and God treated Him as if He had been so, God was a make-believe God.<a name=5:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And again, that Christ was made by His human nature inclined to all those things which the law interdicted.<a name=5:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One other passage of Mr.<a name=5:13></a> Irving's writings I will advert to.<a name=5:14></a> He says, "I hold it to be the surrender of the whole question to say that He was not conscious of, engaged with, and troubled by, every evil disposition which inheriteth in the fallen manhood.<a name=5:15></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Accordingly, their teachers still teach, that the life of the flesh may be put out of the flesh, and the life of Christ put into it; so that we may be perfect as Christ Himself.<a name=5:16></a> And some of their tracts state, that this is the only ground on which we stand in the judgment.<a name=5:17></a> Such is, in fact, the doctrine of this tract, which in page 23 states that the fallen nature, which, if left to follow its own propensities, could do nothing good, was in Christ proved

	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		capable of perfect goodness; and that the prince of this world would find nothing in us either if we were what our head desires to see us.<a name=6:1></a> Accordingly, though they speak of the blood, and justification by the blood, on examination they are found to hold that all the world are justified in it, and righteousness (as was stated to the writer by one of their chief teachers) imputed to the vilest unbeliever as much as to himself or any believer.<a name=6:2></a> The Christian will know how contrary to scripture all this is.<a name=6:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards likeness to Christ, the diligent reader of scripture will see that our likeness to Christ, when applied to this life, is always of walk, not of nature, or in Himself; and likeness to Himself is stated to take place when He appears, and, we being risen, sin is no more a part of our state at all.<a name=6:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I shall now follow each material page of the tract, and notice enough of its subtleties to shew its character.<a name=6:5></a>

		they call fleshly knowledge; but it is a remarkable thing, that precisely what they call knowing the scriptures in the flesh is made the guard against delusion in the perilous times of the last days.<a name=17:1></a> "Continue thou," says the blessed apostle to his son Timothy, "in the things which thou hast learned, knowing of whom thou hast learned them; and that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith, which is in Christ Jesus.<a name=17:2></a>"

		Now we have here precisely what they call fleshly knowledge of the scriptures, the guard against the delusions of the last perilous times; which guard they throw down; it is wrested out of the hand of those that give heed to them.<a name=17:3></a> They say, the guard against the dangers of the last days is the possession of the Spirit which they bring or are sent by.<a name=17:4></a> I find that the fleshly knowledge as they call it of the scriptures, which they reject and discard, is the guard given by the apostle, that is, by the Spirit of God, against the delusions and deceptions of the latter day.<a name=17:5></a> The word is the stability and security of the Church of God.<a name=17:6></a> It is quite true, we cannot use it really but by the Spirit; but that which the Spirit uses, for the comfort and keeping of the children of God, is His word.<a name=17:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And now I will mention some of the interpretations which they have produced as being the authentic interpretations of the mind of God in the scriptures.<a name=17:8></a> In the first place, Isaiah 40.<a name=17:9></a> The former chapter had left the church in Babylon; this chapter speaks of them as actually brought out, no information being given of their state while staying there: this, according to these teachers, is the restoration of the church!<a name=17:10></a> "Comfort ye, comfort ye, my people," means the restoration of apostles.<a name=17:11></a> "The voice of one crying in the wilderness" is the restoration of prophets to the church.<a name=17:12></a> "O Zion, which bringest glad tidings," is the restoration of evangelists; and "He shall feed his flock like a shepherd," is the restoration of pastors.<a name=17:13></a> "Keep silence before me, O islands," (chapter 41) is a command addressed here by the Spirit to the little isolated bodies of Christians.<a name=17:14></a> Then, after referring to previous deliverance, the words "I will give thee a new sharp threshing instrument with teeth, and with it thou shalt thresh the mountains," mean that the poor despised people that have the Lord among them in the gifts shall thresh and break down all the systems of churches and religion.<a name=17:15></a> "I will open rivers in high places:" these are the gifts and presence of the Spirit restored in Newman Street and elsewhere.<a name=17:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=18>[Page 18]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I give this merely as a specimen of their interpretation; I leave the judgment of it to others.<a name=18:1></a> The two latter interpretations are important, because the threshing of systems, or Babylon which they avow these systems to be, seems directly contrary to the statement concerning Babylon given in the Revelation, and in the latter they directly contradict themselves.<a name=18:2></a> It is stated, on the one hand, that the rivers opened in the restoration of the Comforter to the church, known in these gifts, were not flowing in the intermediate time from their exercise in the early days of the church; that heaven had been shut; that they did not exist, but are now restored; so that now, if the poor and needy seek water, then it is in unexpected places thus restored, but, till now so restored, not existing in all the interval.<a name=18:3></a> Now it is also stated by them that the energizings of the Father, the ministries of the Lord, and the operations of the Spirit, are as identified as their persons, and one cannot be without the other, that, if one fail in any measure, the other proportionately fails; and they also state that it is the energizing of the Father which quickens souls, even as Christ was raised from the dead, which last, doubtless, they are quite right in.<a name=18:4></a> Now they conclude, and justly, from this ground, that if the gifts and operations of the Spirit in them ceased, then the energizing of the Father must have ceased also; but this, coupled with the other part of their doctrine, that these gifts did cease, and that there were no rivers but that they are now restored, would simply prove that there never was a soul born to God until these gifts arose and were restored in the Church.<a name=18:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus the very principles of their system do not hang together.<a name=18:6></a> They boast of the restoration of the gifts for themselves.<a name=18:7></a> The thing that they announce is, that they are evangelists of the restoration of them; so that if we do not join them we shall, to say the least, not escape the coming judgments; for they do not venture to say we shall be lost, and yet we are told, if they did not continue, the energizing of the Father did not, so that no soul was born to God at all; and they press the necessary continuance of the gifts in the Church all through.<a name=18:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, though they would now admit that the Spirit dwelt in every believer, at least in some sort or sometimes, but not that the Comforter was in them, their language varies.<a name=18:9></a> They sometimes compare it to the difference of dwelling with them as in Jesus, and being in them as subsequently after the day of Pentecost.<a name=18:10></a> In this latter sense of the Comforter thus being in them, they say we have not the Spirit; and so much so that, if we do not join

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, one point they are very fond of is this, that they are the hundred and forty four-thousand in Revelation 14, and that afterwards the harvest will be: but that those in it will not be able to sing the song which the hundred and forty four thousand do.<a name=19:9></a> But, again, they will take the parable in Mark, and teach us that first there is corn sown, then the long stalk of apostasy, producing nothing, and then the full ear like the grain sown.<a name=19:10></a> These are themselves, not indeed in their present state, but when fully ripened, baptized with the Holy Ghost and fire, and thus perfected to meet the Lord: and then, when they are ripened, immediately He will put in His sickle, because the harvest is come.<a name=19:11></a> Now, it is clear, they change the whole structure and statement of the parable; but both cannot be true: for one identifies them and the harvest, the other makes the very point of their importance, that they are quite distinct from the harvest, and that the harvest is not then come at all, but many most important things between it and them.<a name=19:12></a> I do not agree with their interpretations; but the Spirit of God clearly cannot teach opposite and discordant things.<a name=19:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus far upon the face of their teaching.<a name=19:14></a> Many things I am well aware they would answer, as, that they may err, but they are not the Spirit.<a name=19:15></a> But what then is their teaching, and why receive their extraordinary mission?<a name=19:16></a> They may state the gospel, for aught I know, and state it clearly: others state that they have done so.<a name=19:17></a> I am ready to believe them: one of those who are here ought at least to have known it.<a name=19:18></a> But we are here only where we were before.<a name=19:19></a> The question is, Do they, besides the gospel, state things inconsistent with the truth and Spirit of God?<a name=19:20></a> Besides, do they privily bring in (whether deceived themselves, or doing it wilfully, is not the question, though concerning one at least I am satisfied he is doing it without wilfulness) -- do they privily bring in heresy?<a name=19:21></a> When I have heard them, they preached what

		<a name=20>[Page 20]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I judged very contrary to the gospel.<a name=20:1></a> They taught, as to forgiveness of sins, on Psalm 32, that the love of God led us to judge sin He did, and to confess it to Him and to man, searching it out till we found none, and so we had peace; and Christ and His blood-shedding were not mentioned in connection with it, nor Christ's name, save requiring in one sentence conformity to Him.<a name=20:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I confess, to me this was not preaching the gospel, nor the forgiveness of sins in Christ's name, and therefore I heard what I believe not to be the gospel.<a name=20:3></a> But be it that they have at other times preached the gospel: what else have they taught?<a name=20:4></a> Certainly, they preach themselves; and the joining them as the way of security, not Christ.<a name=20:5></a> They say they were sent by a spirit, the presence of which among them is the only security in the evil day.<a name=20:6></a> And I must therefore judge them by that which the Spirit has done and said, if this is offered as any security in the evil.<a name=20:7></a> They preach the gospel; they explain many things; and I must say that the multiplied variety of the way in which they state things, the very great difference of their statements to different people, their extreme guardedness in the presence of those informed so as to know the contradictoriness of their statements, their refusal to reason the matter when opposed, or unless received as teachers, which is their habit, all to my mind, and specially the want of openness as to what they do hold, contradict that character of the Spirit's truth -- "We use great plainness of speech.<a name=20:8></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have observed even that, where evil is brought in, it is brought in privily -- when truth, the house-top is the suitable place for its announcement.<a name=20:9></a> "Ask them which heard me" (when a nation had been taught), was the righteous appeal.<a name=20:10></a> Ask them, Do they hold that the humanity of our blessed Lord was sinful humanity?<a name=20:11></a> -- a principle originally boasted of by the great instrument and leader in all this work, Mr.<a name=20:12></a> Irving, as the very ground of the introduction of the gifts, that these could not be given till this truth was brought in; and to one they will deny it, to another explain it, to another modify it, and fall back upon scripture words, but saving the point really by something; to another they will acknowledge it to be there, but dead; but that it is really the hinge of the matter, which it really is.<a name=20:13></a> If charged with Mr.<a name=20:14></a> Irving's views on the subject, they disclaim him and his doctrines, and say that they are not bound by them although sent by the church over which he presided as angel, the teacher and expounder of

		But I would press upon your mind that, while I have stated here as to teaching merely what has passed in this country, coming as they do we cannot confine ourselves to their own account of themselves.<a name=21:5></a> They are sent by a spirit which has already expressed itself elsewhere: this spirit is their authority for coming; the gifts connected with it are the very subjects brought before us by their mission.<a name=21:6></a> The gospel we have had, feebly perhaps, before.<a name=21:7></a> The Spirit, or, as they would say, the restored Comforter, is the great point they present -- its presence the security they propose -- its sending them the authority with which they come.<a name=21:8></a> That spirit pronounced young Napoleon to be the man of sin: it stated that an American Indian Chief, then in London, would be converted there, and receive the work and return to America, and lead back his countrymen, who were the ten tribes, to Palestine; but he went back <i>unconverted</i>.<a name=21:9></a> And there are many other things not verified as declared; but I pass by all this.<a name=21:10></a> Signs and wonders may be wrought; things that happen may have been spoken of beforehand; this we know is quite possible, though it is impossible that the Spirit of God could give an untruth.<a name=21:11></a>

		They have attempted to explain these failures in many ways, which a little attention shews to be utterly futile.<a name=21:12></a> Such is the prophecy of conferring apostolic gifts on Mr.<a name=21:13></a> Baxter, and the then promised baptism by fire.<a name=21:14></a> They have attempted to explain it, which is the admission of its failure, by the case of Nineveh.<a name=21:15></a> But the Lord has expressly declared that a pronounced judgment He will turn from, if they against whom it is pronounced repent.<a name=21:16></a> They have attempted to explain it by saying, that Satan had used the person as his instrument, and that what was true was of God-what failed of the enemy, though the utterances had declared this should never be.<a name=21:17></a> They have, in the support of one utterance given to another by acknowledged prophets, really subverted what was given by a former.<a name=21:18></a> They have sometimes got over this by declaring that no individual had any right to interpret the

	<div class="paragraph">
		But the fact is, which to me is determining, they do clearly hold the sinful humanity of the Lord Jesus.<a name=22:3></a> Mr.<a name=22:4></a> Irving was honest enough to own it openly; they are more guarded in their statements -- their present manner is to reject him; they say that the Spirit declared he had said unguarded things, and declare that they will merely use scripture statements; as, that "Christ was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin;" and that the latter clause does not qualify the former.<a name=22:5></a> To me that is quite sufficient; for the latter clause not qualifying the former just means, that sin is not excepted as to temptation.<a name=22:6></a> This is the whole point in question; but the fact is, they do hold the sinful humanity, and have acknowledged that it is the hinge of their whole scheme of doctrine.<a name=22:7></a> Nay, more; the spirit which has sent them has borne witness to it in its worst form; and this is the whole question.<a name=22:8></a> Let them deny, or modify, or perplex any as they will: the spirit on whose authority they act has expressly sanctioned Mr.<a name=22:9></a> Irving's doctrine on the subject -- what this is I shall state to you.<a name=22:10></a>

		What is the answer attempted to this?<a name=23:3></a> First, it is said, that Mr.<a name=23:4></a> Irving wrote this before the spirit came amongst them; just as it is said, when some of the obvious weaknesses and mistakes of one of the evangelists now here are quoted, and the term "the fiction of imputed righteousness" is quoted from his pamphlet, he had not joined them then.<a name=23:5></a> The answer at once is, they are the principles which made him join them.<a name=23:6></a> But Mr.<a name=23:7></a> Irving has stated subsequently, and on the point in question, equally decided things; for, on being condemned for these things by the General Assembly, he desires the Scotch to go to the ministers of their parishes, and ask them to their face if they believe that Christ came in the flesh, and had the law of the flesh and the temptations of flesh to struggle with and overcome; and, if they confess not to this doctrine, to denounce them as denying the Lord that bought them, "as wolves in sheep's clothing;" so that he held the doctrine after the spirit was amongst them, as well and as strongly as before.<a name=23:8></a> But, as the matter stands, his holding it before was the more important, because the spirit came as the seal to it.<a name=23:9></a> And, not only so, but on the question being raised, the spirit which sent these two missionaries gave its express sanction to the doctrine.<a name=23:10></a> I am well aware that they allege that the spirit said that Mr.<a name=23:11></a> Irving had used unguarded expressions.<a name=23:12></a> This may be so; and they may be consequently much more guarded in their expressions, more careful not to alarm people, which he honestly did; but the spirit which sent them confirmed the doctrine as taught by him.<a name=23:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Mr.<a name=23:14></a> Baxter, once designated as their apostle, wrote to Mr.<a name=23:15></a> Irving, stating fully his error in conceiving the law of sin to be in Christ's flesh, etc.<a name=23:16></a> Mr.<a name=23:17></a> Irving warmly supported his own views, and tells him the spirit came upon Miss E.<a name=23:18></a> C.<a name=23:19></a> and (after speaking in a very grieved tone and spirit in a tongue) she was made to declare that Mr.<a name=23:20></a> Baxter had been snared by departing from the word and the testimony; that Mr.<a name=23:21></a> Irving had maintained the truth, and the Lord was well pleased with him for it; which was followed by a similar utterance from Mrs.<a name=23:22></a> C.<a name=23:23></a> and a renewed utterance to the same effect from Miss E.<a name=23:24></a> C.<a name=23:25></a> Thus Mr.<a name=23:26></a> Irving's previous statements just give occasion to

		The sufferings of Christ in us are the sufferings of a holy loving nature in the midst of evil: our giving way to sin in us is not the sufferings of Christ in us.<a name=27:4></a> Our remedy for sin is the atonement of Christ, in what He suffered for us; the entire absence of sin in Him who represents us is the comfort and remedy for this, and, sins being known to be forgiven, having our feet washed, we seek to walk in the strength of that new life, in the conflicts of which we have His full sympathy; and, as has been justly remarked, we should want sympathy in the sorrow of actual transgression, if He were to sympathise with us as to sin.<a name=27:5></a> And, I say, we have this sympathy; but how?<a name=27:6></a> where?<a name=27:7></a> In His having borne the penalty for them -- "bruised for our iniquities, wounded for our transgressions.<a name=27:8></a>" It is precisely in the discovery that He did bear our transgressions, and so has justified us -- in knowing that He hath "put away sin by the sacrifice of himself" -- that we have comfort under all sense of sin -- not by His having been conscious of the evil disposition; or He could not, as "knowing no sin," be made sin for me.<a name=27:9></a> And this then I take in its full, unlimited sense, according to my whole need, as believing in Him.<a name=27:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the Spirit of God did lead Christ into temptation (we are expressly told in Matthew 4 and Luke 4), not surely into any exercise of a sinful nature, but into Satan's trial of what He was.<a name=29:10></a> So the first Adam, confessedly innocent and having no sin (that we may turn to man), yet was tempted, and so tempted that he fell into sin.<a name=29:11></a> So that clearly here temptation does not imply existing evil, or a sinful nature; for there may be temptation, so as to fall into sin, where there was no evil nature at all.<a name=29:12></a> He was tried and fell; weakness and fallibility being there, though not sin.<a name=29:13></a> We are tempted -- what is in us is tried; and in our case evil continually is found.<a name=29:14></a> The old sinful nature is found.<a name=29:15></a> there may be cases where, through divine grace, we get the victory, "are more than conquerors," glorying in tribulations, happy as enduring.<a name=29:16></a> The sinful nature is distinct from the temptation, though discovered by it.<a name=29:17></a> So Christ was tempted, tried in all points, according to the likeness of His brethren; but the result was, that nothing was found in Him but perfectness.<a name=29:18></a> Adam was tried and fell; we are tried, and often evil is found in us, and we are led away and enticed.<a name=29:19></a> Christ was tried, and neither fell nor was led away, nor evil found in Him.<a name=29:20></a>

		If sin was needful to temptation, then would sin be justified in every temptation we were in, for we could not, they say, be tempted without it.<a name=29:21></a> Now temptation coming from an enemy without, and sin being needful to this, it is justified if we are so tempted.<a name=29:22></a> This is exactly what it is not.<a name=29:23></a> "There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man" -- a human temptation -- and God is faithful, who "will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.<a name=29:24></a>"

		Thus, though we often do give way, it is shewn to be sin when we do, and unjustifiable; and this, as to its source, is what is meant by condemning sin in the flesh.<a name=30:1></a> Christ, having placed Himself in our circumstances (which as to trial He fully did), and having never, in any sort or sense, given way, has proved that what does give way (the lusts that entice us, and make us yield to the temptation) is sin; for perfect human nature, and thorough temptation was in Him, <i>choris amartias</i> -- everything except sin; and so has condemned sin, not in <i>His</i> flesh but in <i>the</i> flesh, being without sin, and passing through all the temptations, and so made a sacrifice for sin.<a name=30:2></a> Thus, concerning it, He has proved it all to be sin in us; He has condemned sin in the flesh, though He gives us peace concerning and in spite of it, because He is a sacrifice for sin, <i>peri amartias</i>.<a name=30:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus His being tempted in all points apart from sin is precisely the way in which He condemned it; not in its acts but in its source -- the very difference of a believer taught by the Spirit and having the Spirit of Christ.<a name=30:4></a> He knows not only transgression, but sin as an evil, sin dwelling in him.<a name=30:5></a> More correctly, God condemned sin in the flesh, by the exhibition of a tempted man, in every point without it.<a name=30:6></a> It was not actual sin that He thus condemned (that had been done, and would be done in due time), but "sin in the flesh.<a name=30:7></a>" The law could not do this (it only called it out into knowledge, and even action); but God has effectually done it, sending His own Son, free from every spot, stain, or motion of it -- from it in His nature; so that it is all condemned as mere sin in me, not in its effects, but "in the flesh.<a name=30:8></a>" Had it been in Christ, I could not condemn it as sin, or I must have charged Christ with it as sin; so that the absence of it from Him is the very means of my condemning it as such.<a name=30:9></a> The thing wanted was to shew this as judged, condemned sin by God.<a name=30:10></a> The law could not do this, but found sin everywhere; it was weak through the flesh.<a name=30:11></a> Law connected itself with men as they were, leaving it; and though therefore it might prove they had sin, it only therefore condemned them.<a name=30:12></a> But God, sending His own Son in the likeness of this sinful flesh and for sin, has condemned (in propitiation withal) this in the flesh: and the life which we have of Him, strengthened in His might by His Spirit in the inner man, judges and condemns it in us, as not according to the power of the inner life in Christ.<a name=30:13></a> This is the force of the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And this as to the fact is the express doctrine of scripture.<a name=31:3></a> He was in all points tempted like as we are, according to the likeness He was in, except sin.<a name=31:4></a> The English passage does not convey the meaning properly, specially the latter clause; for "yet" might imply that it might mean actual sin resulting; though, I admit, a simple scripture-taught mind would take the sense aright.<a name=31:5></a> The statement of the teachers from Newman Street is, that the latter clause is not meant to qualify the former.<a name=31:6></a> What then is it for?<a name=31:7></a> this is just the difference -- He was tempted in all points, according to the likeness [He took], except (or, apart from) sin; that is, that which is connected, or continually so in us, with temptation, was not so in Him.<a name=31:8></a> It is the revelation of that difference precisely: He was tempted apart from sin -- we are tempted in connection with that which has been condemned as sin, not being in Him.<a name=31:9></a> It is sin which is in our nature, which makes us give way.<a name=31:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The "yet without sin," which I translated "apart from sin," is the same word as in the passage, "He shall appear the second time without sin.<a name=31:11></a>" As free as He then will be from it, so free was He in the temptations He went through.<a name=31:12></a> Thus, we have the express testimony of scripture on the point.<a name=31:13></a> Every trial, every sorrow, every circumstance, in which the enemy of our souls could try Him, He was tempted with <i>chath omoioteta</i>.<a name=31:14></a> Everything which sin had caused as an effect He bore; in His nature He was sinless.<a name=31:15></a> He sympathizes with us in every trial of ours as new creatures.<a name=31:16></a> He judges -- God has judged -- and strengthens us against the suggestions of our old man, with which He can have no sympathy, but which is all condemned, we being received because He has willingly died for us as to it all, which was the sympathy we wanted for it, and which He could not have given if He had been in any way or sort sinful Himself.<a name=31:17></a> He could not then have been made sin.<a name=31:18></a>

		But while scripture is thus express on the point, the contrary doctrine, their doctrine, really destroys the incarnation.<a name=31:19></a> Christ's generation, to use Mr.<a name=31:20></a> Irving's words, is no more than the implantation of that Holy Ghost life in the members of His human nature, which is implanted in us by regeneration.<a name=31:21></a> This is

		It appears to me that the real truth of the Comforter's presence is also denied, saying that it is restored, when God said it should abide for ever, and consequently the power of judging them taken out of the Christian's hands; for if He has not the Spirit, it is clear He is incapable of it.<a name=32:10></a> The word is rendered of no avail; because, as they speak, we have read it in the flesh, and therefore can use no previous knowledge of it against them.<a name=32:11></a> All this is the crafty subversion of the great truth on which the soul rests.<a name=32:12></a> God is for me, is already with me, and by His help and word I must judge of all that is presented to me; and this, with fundamentally false doctrine and no sign of authority about them, we are called upon to believe what they say, under pain of being in awful, perhaps fatal, judgments.<a name=32:13></a> Their great instrument is terror.<a name=32:14></a> If a man knows his peace with God, knows he is taught of God, and that he has the Spirit of God; and if he is not unsound on the sinfulness of the Lord's nature, and holds to the word of God, their persuasions -- however subtle, and full of gorgeous promises when listened to, promises often falsified by facts

		The more the question treated in the following tract is weighed, the more important it will be found; and the doctrine taught in Mr.<a name=34:1></a> Newton's "Remarks" to be the destruction of the gospel of truth, and to subvert the foundations of Christianity.<a name=34:2></a> The denial that it is meant so to do is nothing to the purpose.<a name=34:3></a> Mr.<a name=34:4></a> Irving denied it just as stoutly; but a man's teaching is to be judged by what he teaches, not by his own opinion about it.<a name=34:5></a> What Mr.<a name=34:6></a> Newton teaches subverts the truth as to Christ.<a name=34:7></a> If he says it does not, it only proves that he does not know the truth which it clearly does subvert.<a name=34:8></a> The largest expressions of piety and holiness prove nothing.<a name=34:9></a> They were found in Mr.<a name=34:10></a> Irving's writings, and much most blessed and precious truth too: few writings could be named where there is so much.<a name=34:11></a> It is well known how widely Mr.<a name=34:12></a> Prince's books were circulated, how highly they were appreciated, and how many were supposed to be converted by him.<a name=34:13></a> Now all acquainted with the circumstances know the horrible blasphemies in which it all has ended.<a name=34:14></a> And now persons who examine the books judge that they find all through them the germ of the present horrors.<a name=34:15></a>

		Now, as to the doctrine of the writer of the "Remarks," he states that Christ, associating Himself with man in the flesh at a distance from God, had to find His way to a point where God could meet Him, and which point was death under the wrath of God.<a name=34:16></a> Now if Christ was "obnoxious" to this wrath ("exposed" to it) from the place He was in, He could not bear it besides in a vicarious way for us.<a name=34:17></a> A man that has not himself incurred debts, but, being partner with one who has, is liable to them, cannot as surety in the way of kindness take them upon him.<a name=34:18></a> That is, vicarious suffering is set aside.<a name=34:19></a> If it be said that death under the wrath of God consequent on the distance man was at from God

		As to the nature of Christ's sufferings, there is another passage I would refer to.<a name=35:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle desires that he might know the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings, being made conformable to His death.<a name=35:8></a> Now we have here the nature of the sufferings of Christ even to death, not in the sense of vicarious sufferings.<a name=35:9></a> The apostle clearly could not desire to be obnoxious and exposed to wrath because of the position he was in at a distance from God.<a name=35:10></a> But in the devotedness of service in which, in denial of all will of his own, he found himself as acting for God, and manifesting Him in life and in word in opposition to the whole wickedness of man and power and malice of Satan, and in the suffering of that devotedness in love to them that were God's, he did desire to be made conformable to Christ by His grace.<a name=35:11></a> Now this came upon him from without, but it was weighed and realized in the Spirit of Christ beforehand within, so that all this suffering without was understood, and took its place in his mind from what was already spiritually there.<a name=35:12></a> Thus he was "pressed out of measure, above strength, so that he despaired even of life; but he had the sentence of death in himself, that he should not trust in himself but in God which raiseth the dead;" so, "always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life of Jesus may be manifested in his mortal body.<a name=35:13></a> For we which live are always delivered unto death for Jesus sake, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal body.<a name=35:14></a>" Here Christ's sufferings were not vicarious,<a href="#35:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a> and such as we can
	</div>
	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#35:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>Irvingism taught that there was no personal sin in Christ, but that there was in the nature He took, so that He was exposed and liable to death. <p>Mr. N. teaches that there was no personal sin in Christ; and not that there was in His nature, but that He was liable to the consequences of it from His position in relation to God from the time He was born into the world. Both alike set aside the atonement.

	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#35:f2"><sup>++</sup></a>So he speaks of filling up that which was behind of the sufferings of Christ for His body's sake, which is the church; the fruit of devoted love which brought him into them, not the effect of his relation to God inflicted by God upon him.

		I now quote from the "Christian Witness" to shew the way in which he then identified the sufferings in question with vicarious sufferings.<a name=40:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"All that the soul of a saint recognizes as true in the writings of Mr.<a name=40:11></a> Irving, respecting Christ being in 'that condition of being and region of existence which is proper to a sinner,' will be found to be altogether comprised in the fact of His being born under the curse of the exiled family vicariously incurred.<a name=40:12></a> But He rose out of this 'region' through the power of His own inherent holiness; and, therefore never would have come 'into that experience into [read, of] God's action which is proper for a sinner,' unless He had chosen to abide it<a href="#40:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> for the sake of others; and when He had chosen this, then it pleased the Lord to bruise Him, and to lay upon Him iniquity; a burden which He felt just as if it had been His own iniquity.<a name=40:13></a> Without having any sin, He was made to feel the consequences of sin, even so as to say, 'Mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of my head, therefore my heart faileth me.<a name=40:14></a>' But this was not because 'He was in our region of existence,' but because He was pleased, whilst being there, to become the sin-bearer for others.<a name=40:15></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this might well lead an unsuspecting mind to suppose that he was opposing the truth of Christ's vicarious suffering to Mr.<a name=40:16></a> Irving's heresy of sin in Christ's nature.<a name=40:17></a> Now, however, Mr.<a name=40:18></a> Newton declares positively that this was not vicarious.<a name=40:19></a> Not that He never would have come into that experience into God's action which is proper for a sinner, unless He had chosen to

		<a class="footnote" name="#48:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>The principles of the two tracts are precisely the same. I have given the statements of the first tract, as shewing that the whole is a well-ordered system; but this quotation is from the second. The second says also, "the felt weakness of His humanity." I add here this monstrous statement as to Gethsemane from the second: "The danger that had approached so nigh the sleeping disciples, and which Jesus alone had appreciated, was driven away. A gulf unseen by them had yawned around them -- but it was gone." What was gone? "His conflict just passed had given them deliverance from the danger that threatened them in Gethsemane ... . It [Jesus will] had not wavered. And, therefore, was not Jesus justified in speaking [saying, Sleep on now] as if the end had been perfectly and fully reached? ... If therefore, the danger that had just threatened was removed, and if that which He was then doing was to give them sure, unchangeable, peaceful security from all the power of Satan and of sin for evermore, why should He not regard them as those who had passed through their last dangerous storm, and who had virtually reached the haven. 'Sleep on and take your rest.'" What has their last dangerous storm to do with atonement? They could aid here, it is said? "'Sleep on and take your rest.' They are words not of upbraiding, but of comfort, or if anything like sorrow mingles with them, it is in the thought that the occasion was lost of aiding in a conflict such as that in Gethsemane had been ... . They might have prayed with Him in Gethsemane." So His seeking for sympathy and prayer from His disciples (tract 1, page 18). He never sought their prayers. "Tarry ye here while I go and pray yonder." He certainly never sought their aid in a conflict where He found "the terrors of the Almighty set in array against him."

		Can any one doubt to what this alludes, adding the word "yet" to do away the effect?<a name=49:1></a> Now I say that no person taught of God in the foundation-principles of God's truth could say, that though the cross was the place where He was made distinctly the sacrifice for sin, Christ dreaded not the cross as He dreaded Gethsemane; for, though he may be forced to say the cross was a sacrifice for sin, such a statement makes it clear that the idea of the wrath of God does not exist in his mind, and that, having suffered what was not a sacrifice for sin, but a distinct character of suffering not vicarious, but weak humanity under the power of Satan allowed to be brought upon Him; that "Sleep on, take your rest" was His word to the Church now: "we may rest, the difficulties are over; and we may sleep on undisturbed in blessed and happy security and rest, for all is over now" -- I say it is impossible one taught of God could say so, because it is not a question of difficulties but of atonement.<a name=49:2></a> The forsaking of God was not come; the subject of dread according to the writer was a distinct and more terrible one.<a name=49:3></a> The sacrifice for sin was not yet in accomplishment.<a name=49:4></a> Nothing vicarious was touched as yet.<a name=49:5></a> It was not anticipation of the cup according to the writer, but a distinct thing which Jesus dreaded, and which was over when Gethsemane was finished; and yet all was over, so that the Church was secure and at rest when the vicarious work of atonement was not begun!<a name=49:6></a> I say, no person to whom the faith of God's elect is precious, to whom the atonement of Christ is a reality and the centre of hope, could possibly have had such a thought, or (unless blinded of Satan) not have recognized that it was of Satan.<a name=49:7></a>

		Further, that Christ was obnoxious to wrath from His coming into the world as part of a cursed people, and changed His relationship to God at John's baptism, because he preached repentance and remission of sins, and the new economy of grace was introduced, and that He found relief in his message, so that, from the moment He took that ground, God's seal was set upon Him, "This is my beloved Son," and He ceased to afflict Him as obnoxious to wrath -- is doctrine so destructive of the real human relationship of the blessed Jesus to God, so ruinous to His person, motives, and the path of Him who grew in favour with God, that no one who knows Christ could receive it for a moment.<a name=49:8></a>

It was by the appointment of God and measured by that, and a positive infliction of God; yet, being from His birth obnoxious to it, He escaped a great deal by faith, prayer, and obedience. But it was His privilege and glory to have a great deal, and be chief in it. We, however, are never under Israel's curse, which this was. He extricated Himself out of this privilege by His perfect obedience, elsewhere by accepting John's message by a wise heart; and though measured by the appointment of God, and a dealing of the hand of God, yet there were "continual interferences of God in His behalf" to deliver Him from them. How truly those who depart from the faith and exercise their own mind in order to have a great appearance of knowledge, know not what they say, nor whereof they affirm! Nothing more strikes me, than the total absence of all divine teaching in all these statements. That total absence in the writer's teaching I have been fully convinced of now for several years.

Happily the hearers were guarded enough of God for it to strike and alarm them: the lecturer was spoken to, and it was of course explained away. The way in which the doctrine of the tracts used to be taught at Plymouth (for it is nothing new), was that Christ was a constituted sinner subject to death, and worked His way up to life. But not being in writing, it was hard, as regards others, to verify it. See Introduction, as to the "Christian Witness," however.

		Hence our souls, though unable to estimate it, can understand its perfectness, and in spirit pass adoringly with Jesus into the midst of His sorrow: nay, it is our privilege to enter into that part of His sorrow -- His holy sorrow -- which flowed from sinlessness and love, from service in spirit and knowledge of the mind of God in the midst of sin, to have the fellowship of His sufferings.<a name=52:6></a> His death itself can and is to be viewed in this light also, looked at as coming from man, and even Satan, however far this may be from being all that is found there, as indeed it is.<a name=52:7></a>

That Christ was born under the law, and, being sinless under it, was not obnoxious to wrath, and that He took its curse on the tree: *that* scripture teaches. But that He was obnoxious to wrath under it by identification with Israel, and the relation He was in to God thereby, is unknown to scripture. That relation is vengeance, certain inevitable vengeance: as many as are of its works, as mere men, are under its curse, which is vengeance. Christ, exempt from that, took it on Himself. That there were curses written in the law which were come on the people, as recited by Daniel, is unquestionable, and that Christ's soul entered into the sorrow of them. But that is not the question; and, to reduce the curse of a broken law to the level of this, and cite Galatians 3: 10 as referring to it, only shews that the bearing of the apostle's teaching, the light which the rent veil has cast on the true extent of the curse of the broken law, does not enter at all into the mind of the writer. What is Sinai's mountain of blackness in the eye of the apostle, if it be not condemnation and death, even in spite of the grace in government introduced by the mediation of Moses? For it is the law after, and in spite of this, which is spoken of in 2 Corinthians 3. As if to heap inconsistency on inconsistency, though it is useless to point all of them out, especially when far more solemn things are in question. the place of the Church of the firstborn, used, in page 23, to illustrate Christ's place after John's baptism and the anointing which followed, is declared, in page 31, not to have been His place during His ministry. "Man was yet in his distance from God. There was as yet no glorified humanity on the right hand of the throne of God," etc. "The mighty power of God [in resurrection] not yet put forth; the Spirit, not yet become the unfolder and seal [of things to come], etc.; and Jesus, as man, was associated with this place of distance, in which man in the flesh was, and He had, through obedience, to find His way," etc. And note here, this goes on to the cross. Where, then, is all the grand difference on John's baptism, illustrated by a change from Sinai to the place of the Church of the firstborn? Is it not pitiable to see souls bewildered and misled by such things, under the pretence of deep knowledge? In page 16 of the first tract it is said, that Christ's place, during the time of His ministry is granted to us, and that we never come under the curse of Israel, which was His first place; in page 31 of the second -- during His ministry on earth, He came into a place dispensationally lower than that into which He has now brought His Church. If we are not in the first condition, and not in the second, it is hard to tell how Christ is an example If it be said: As man (here, page 31, referred to the place He took in ministry after all), He is associated with man at a distance from God, which is said not to be our place at all. On the last paragraph I have referred to, I shall comment on its own account. But how, in this confusion, is Christ lost to those under this instruction? Thus at sea, with Jesus not really known, they are a prey to any thoughts imposed upon them. But my object is not to shew the confusion, and leave souls in it to fly in despair they know not where, but to shew the very distinct, positive, deadly error insisted on in the midst of this confusion into which the soul, lost in it, falls, having no true knowledge of Christ to keep them.

		I will now refer to some of the Psalms which are quoted to shew Christ's sufferings in them, and we shall see if they are not connected with the contradiction of sinners, that is, with His service in respect of them and suffering from them; not His relation to God as being in the same place with them; ending (after faithfulness through it all) with their outwardly getting the mastery over Him, and therein (because making atonement) being left to them and forsaken of God.<a name=56:13></a> Whereas, the remnant of Israel in the latter days, to which much refers in the sympathy of Christ, will for the most part be delivered as others had before.<a name=56:14></a> They had trusted in God and been delivered; whilst the enemy could taunt Him with trusting in God, and not being delivered.<a name=56:15></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#66:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>Very recently, a brother under the teaching of this system stated that Christ had to be judged, after His death, like another man. This alarmed a brother who heard it, and he spoke of it. The circumstance struck me much, because I had myself heard Mr. N. teaching this from Hebrews 9 at least five years ago, or more, at a private teaching meeting at which I happened, as just arrived at the house where it was held, to be present. I spoke about it, on going out, to Mr. Harris, who was present, with astonishment; but said nothing about it at the meeting, as Mr. Newton never could bear anything to be called in question. I supposed it was some rash view or statement; and as I did not (though unsatisfied by his teaching, and already miserable at the state of things) suspect any design or system of doctrine, I went no farther than to speak of it anxiously to Mr. Harris. There is daily more of this extraordinary teaching coming out since attention has been drawn to it, but I advert no farther to the particulars here. The ground of this was, that, as it was appointed unto men once to die and after that the judgment, Christ being a man, these things were for Him too. The same ground was stated in the recent case referred to.

		In the psalms which follow on this, this is fully entered into; that is, the Spirit of Christ draws out the whole scene, becoming the spring and portrayer of all the varied exercises of feeling in that day, in the fullest sympathy with the humble, whose heart God had prepared.<a name=72:2></a> And it is exceedingly lovely to see all the weaknesses, sorrows, thoughts, feelings, exercises, spoken of by the Spirit of Christ Himself.<a name=72:3></a> All this supposes weakness: "I had said almost as they," says the poor oppressed upright one in that day; that, when all the circumstances by which they shall be occasioned in that day are <i>there</i>, they may have, by the word, the vehicle to their hearts of this sympathy, and the certainty of it in the very thoughts presented by it for and in the circumstances.<a name=72:4></a> It is not an excellency out of the reach of their condition; it is the entering of the Spirit of Christ into it.<a name=72:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Often, as in Psalm 14, we have the Lord's view of all this.<a name=73:3></a> He rises above the circumstances and takes a view of them.<a name=73:4></a> How encouraging to the poor tried remnant!<a name=73:5></a> yet, putting them in their place as sinners, for they are not by known redemption out of that, though they wait and hope for it.<a name=73:6></a> Hence it is, too, that these psalms often suit souls awakened and in that state.<a name=73:7></a> Thus in Psalm 15 we have just a description of the character of those who shall find a place in God's tabernacle.<a name=73:8></a> In Psalm 16 we find one of those psalms which shews us, as the apostle quotes their general principle as illustrating the position of Christ, that He did not merely depict and express, or sympathize, in a way of provision for or in divine intelligence, the sorrows of the remnant, but that He came Himself into their place, and suffered, being tempted, and tasted all the sorrow, so as to be able to succour them that were tempted.<a name=73:9></a> He was in the place, not of distance, but of dependence.<a name=73:10></a> It is saints who want sympathy, however weak, and however their feelings are the expressions of infirmity -- not man at a distance and disobedient.<a name=73:11></a> He was in the position of dependence in the place of sorrow, but perfection, in the dependence of a saint.<a name=73:12></a> Here Christ looks to be preserved by God, for, as a man, He puts His trust in Him.<a name=73:13></a> He said to Jehovah, "He was his <i>Adon</i> (his Lord): to the saints and the excellent on earth, all his delight was in them" -- not with man at a distance, as Himself obnoxious to wrath because He was there (though saints may feel their sins when called into the place of trial and repentance and chastening -- feel them according to grace), nor with the mass of disobedient Israel, but with the saints and excellent of the earth.<a name=73:14></a> This is Christ's place in the Psalms, unless alone in the atonement.<a name=73:15></a> Still it is in Israel.<a name=73:16></a> He will not go after another god: Jehovah was the portion of His inheritance; and He sees, in this confidence in Jehovah, the resurrection as His path of life and joy.<a name=73:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think I see in these Psalms, which are the expression of the thoughts of Christ Himself, in a certain sense a higher tone, more perfectness, in that He is in the absolute completeness and perfectness of feeling which belongs to perfectness in the place in which He is.<a name=73:18></a> He may be in the very depths, but He is perfectly and perfect.<a name=73:19></a> there.<a name=73:20></a> He has exactly that feeling which suits a

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus this Psalm 16.<a name=74:6></a> So Psalm 22 -- forsaken of God, no uncertainty, no hope He may not be.<a name=74:7></a> He is yet (O wondrous thought, and blessed one that it should have been so!<a name=74:8></a>) equally perfect in His estimate of God: "Thou continuest holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel.<a name=74:9></a>" All the powers of evil were then against Him: He is at the same time forsaken of His God, for whom to be near Him He cried in the hour of distress: but perfect in owning the perfection of God in it notwithstanding all.<a name=74:10></a> Weakness, hostility, and abandonment did not give an imperfect thought of all that God was.<a name=74:11></a> He was heard.<a name=74:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So, in my judgment, Psalm 23 where He walks the path of the blessing and trial of faith.<a name=74:13></a> and presents the confidence of it (putting forth His sheep, He goes before them), and shews it to them whatever He had to suffer in it, assured to them what Jehovah was -- He who He was proved Himself to be in Psalm 24.<a name=74:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But in Psalm 22 it was not sufferings in a day of trouble which could be contemplated and entered into by others, and the psalm is, and must be, in the mouth of Jesus Himself.<a name=75:6></a> He alone could enter, and in entering understand, that depth.<a name=75:7></a> And hence, being of expiatory power as bearing the forsaking of God, which was not the portion of His believing people, He, as now heard<a href="#75:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> in resurrection, can declare Jehovah's name on a new ground to His brethren; and, assembling the remnant round Himself, sing in the midst of the congregation, the gathered remnant of Israel redeemed into fuller blessings, and which became the nucleus of the Church -- the Church, in fact, itself in its commencement.<a name=75:8></a> But thereon He calls on all Israel also, in virtue of this His being heard.<a name=75:9></a> And His praise is in the <i>great</i> congregation -- all Israel, when fully gathered hereafter; and then all the ends of the world, "for the kingdom is Jehovah's.<a name=75:10></a>" This gives a very peculiar force to this psalm -- in its own proper depth, beyond all our feelings, and the foundation of all our hopes.<a name=75:11></a>

He delivered it up, as it is stated in John 19: 30; He commended it into His Father's hands. (Luke 23: 46.) His soul, while living, had gone morally through all the full depth of the -- to us -- unfathomable suffering of the atoning work, and gave up His spirit Himself to God His Father. But it is evident that the full answer to His prayer was in resurrection. "He asked life of thee, and thou gavest him long life, even length of days for ever and ever. His glory is great in thy salvation." Full glory, indeed, at God's right hand, and the redemption of the Church; and, indeed, power over all flesh, and headship over all things, are the only full answer to His work as to result; but we speak here of life. So Psalm 16 -- "Thou wilt shew me the path of life; in thy presence is fulness of joy, and at thy right hand pleasures for evermore."

		<a class="footnote" name="#87:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>It is well to remark, that the word in Psalm 119, "I have gone astray like a sheep that is lost," which Mr. N. applies to Christ, is the same that is used in Isaiah 53: 6 -- "All we, like sheep, have gone astray;" and in a moral way it is ever used of moral error -- indeed, is always used in the sense of evil, either moral, or, in a few passages, of misery. This application of Psalm 119 to Christ by Mr. N., well known to all who have heard him, and confirmed in his own tract on the sufferings of Christ (note to page 16), is to be remarked by Christians. It is a part of that utter and revolting disrespect for Christ which characterizes all their teaching; because it is not only verse 176 in which going astray is attributed to him who speaks, but in verse 67: -- "Before I was afflicted, I went astray: but *now* have I kept thy word." What does "go astray" mean here? And here I shall mention some circumstances connected with this word. In the notes which are so abundantly circulated, one, amongst others, was furnished to persons in communion where all this evil is not received, in which sins of ignorance were directly in terms attributed to Christ; and here I shall give a brief statement of what these notes are. They are not the communication of casual notes taken by anybody, for which it would be hard to render any one responsible: they are taken by a clever and assiduous disciple of Mr. N.'s, a very good and correct note-taker, copied out fair, and given to other disciples to be copied and circulated; some being paid for doing it. Now I will not here attribute to Mr. N. the ascribing sins of ignorance to Christ in the lecture referred to -- I shall just now say why. But this is certain, that his most efficient and ardent disciples so take it, copy it, read, recommend, and circulate it. These notes having been read by another whose faith was not yet ruined by this teaching -- this person was naturally shocked at the blasphemous doctrines contained in them, and the thing became known and spoken of at Plymouth; and a friend of Mr. N.'s, one, though his disciple, too much taught of old in the faith to bear this, got the notes and had them interlined so as that the words "sins of ignorance" should be disconnected from Christ, and taken as a comparison of what in others was like what was spoken of as being in Him. But how must feeling about Christ have been lost and destroyed by the teaching, that the disciples of Mr. N. should not have been at once stopped by finding sins attributed to Christ! Nor is it surprising; for, though I do not pretend to attribute to Mr. N. what some of his friends say cannot be, though others have diligently circulated as his, it is quite certain that Mr. N.'s teaching does so. Psalm 119 he applies directly to Christ. See page 15 of his tract, where, verse 9, "Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way," is applied to Him; and the psalm in general, note to page 16. <p>But, as to attributing sins of ignorance to Christ, which Mr. N.'s poor deluded victims are circulating as such blessed teaching, this is certain, that there is nothing more in it than what Mr. N. does teach. He attributes Psalm 119 to Christ; explaining away, indeed, one of the passages which says, that he who speaks went astray. But verse 67, which also states that before he was afflicted he went astray, employs the word which is used all through Leviticus and Numbers for sinning or sins through ignorance. <p>And I beg also the reader to remark the comparison he makes to justify the application of this and other psalms to Christ. "If I were to send a faithful servant heavily burdened to scale the sides of an icy mountain, and were to see his foot slide, should I marvel? But what, if I should see him stumble or slip in some easy path, because of carelessness, etc., how different my judgment of his conduct!" Did the faithful servant heavily burdened (and whom that represents I can leave the reader to judge of) -- did His foot slide on the icy mountain? What does Mr. N. mean about Christ in saying this? He would not marvel at His foot sliding! Is indignation to be restrained at such language? Woe be to the man that hears, encourages, or sanctions such blasphemies. <p>Either Mr. N. is deliberately seeking to degrade and dishonour Christ, or he is a blind instrument of Satan in doing it.

		vicarious sin-bearing.<a name=89:1></a> And we are called upon to arm <i>ourselves</i> with the same mind, not most certainly with inflictions from God in wrath.<a name=89:2></a> So, verses 12-19, of the fiery trial: -- "Think it not strange concerning the fiery trial .<a name=89:3></a>.<a name=89:4></a>.<a name=89:5></a> .<a name=89:6></a> but rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings .<a name=89:7></a>.<a name=89:8></a>.<a name=89:9></a> If any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf.<a name=89:10></a> For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God .<a name=89:11></a>.<a name=89:12></a>.<a name=89:13></a> Wherefore, let them that suffer according to the will of God .<a name=89:14></a>.<a name=89:15></a>.<a name=89:16></a> .<a name=89:17></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		Here, then, we have sufferings by appointment, and that by judgment on the house of God; and true saints suffering as Christians, partaking of Christ's sufferings in it: in which they were to rejoice; so that the nature of such sufferings, as known in and by Christ, is entirely contrary to what the writer has taught concerning them.<a name=89:18></a> It was no strange thing, but a thing understood and known; and the very contrary of the writer's doctrine on the points he treats of.<a name=89:19></a> For such sufferings by appointment, and inflictions of God in judgment on the house of God, we, according to him, have nothing to say to.<a name=89:20></a> Christ extricated Himself out of, and preserved Himself from, them; whereas I find we are to rejoice in partaking of them with Him.<a name=89:21></a>

		So in Hebrews 12, after many partial though blessed exhibitions of faith held up to lead us to run with patience, it is added, "Looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of faith," One who has begun and finished the whole course of faith, in which faith is exercised; so that we have here everything in which He trod the path -- <i>archegon chai teleioten</i> -- who has led in and completed the course: "who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of God.<a name=89:22></a> For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners<a href="#89:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.<a name=89:23></a> Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.<a name=89:24></a>" And then taking, as to us, another view of it.<a name=89:25></a> "And ye have forgotten the exhortation, which speaketh unto you as unto children.<a name=89:26></a> My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him.<a name=89:27></a> For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.<a name=89:28></a>" Now that Christ had no need to be rebuked is certain; but so far as this can have any application to Him, as a trial and exercise of perfectness in circumstances, it is clear it relates to His enduring from the wickedness of men,

	<div class="paragraph">
		So, in the doing of God's will, which was His whole career in life and death, in Hebrews 10, the apostle sees no such thing as inflictions of God on Him as associated with those who had not done it.<a name=90:2></a> It was to do God's will that His body was prepared: but there is no connection with sins in relation to God in wrath but the offering of His body <i>once</i>.<a name=90:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Indeed, Hebrews 7: 27, I doubt not, contradicts directly the statement of the writer; for though, as High Priest, Christ exercises His office as made higher than the heavens, yet His qualifications must have existed previously in order to be in that place: holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, made higher than the heavens.<a name=90:4></a> He is made <i>(genomenos)</i> higher than the heavens, but He was constantly separate from sinners, distinguished in position from them.<a name=90:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And Christ perfect through sufferings, as has been observed by others, is connected with His tasting death.<a name=90:6></a> So, if He partook, and in as far as He partook of the children's, not the wicked's, place -- flesh and blood, it was that through death, etc.<a name=90:7></a>; and it behoved Him in all things to be made like unto His brethren.<a name=90:8></a> But how so?<a name=90:9></a> "For in that he hath suffered being tempted, he might be able to succour them that are tempted," "for he was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.<a name=90:10></a>" It was not extricating Himself out of something He was in, because sinners were there; but entering into all, that the children were in, of trial and difficulty, that He might succour them there.<a name=90:11></a> So in the "strong crying and tears in the days of his flesh," giving thus the whole constant character to them as such, it was "unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared.<a name=90:12></a>" It was not inflictions on the position of the ungodly.<a name=90:13></a> It was piety met God's eye in His cry and reached His ear; and thus, "though he were a son, <i>he</i> learned obedience by the things which he suffered, and being made perfect," etc.<a name=90:14></a> There is no thought of another kind and class of sufferings; yet the sufferings are fully spoken of and considered, and so as to leave no room for, but entirely exclude, the blasphemous doctrine of the author as to the position Christ was in.<a name=90:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Further, remark, the position He was in was for sins of others; so that, if this redemption by living righteously under the law was accomplished and effectual, it was accomplished effectually for them, for it was the position they were in He took.<a name=91:8></a> But, indeed, it is hard to say it was; for, according to the author, though He extricated Himself from this position by His own righteousness, He preserved Himself only from a part of it.<a name=91:9></a> For some eighteen years He had to bear as much as God thought proper during that period.<a name=91:10></a> Of what avail, then, was His perfect obedience to bring Him out of it, since He suffered under it a good while?<a name=91:11></a> or, why so suffer, if He was perfect enough in obedience to merit getting out of it?<a name=91:12></a> For it was not for others in effect then, for He alone got out; nor for us, for we were never in it, says the author.<a name=91:13></a> Or why was John's baptism for the remission of sins so blessed to Him to get out of this position, if He was getting out of it solely by His own righteousness?<a name=91:14></a> It is no answer to say that He chose to abide there with Israel, for it was a different way of getting out; nor, if He was relieving Himself by remission, was He fulfilling righteousness.<a name=91:15></a> He falsified His place, for, then, to work effectually for Israel, He ought to have separated Himself from them, as now able to take up their cause; nor can it be said that He chose then to enter into their condition, because getting remission of sins by repentance, as joy and deliverance to His own soul and new ground, was not associating Himself with their sins.<a name=91:16></a>

		He got from Sinai to Zion then; but how was that taking Sinai-place with them?<a name=91:17></a> And it is all confusion moreover to say, that He did what Israel would not, because, without any previous title of righteousness at all, multitudes were baptized by John, confessing their sins; nor was John's ministry to Israel such as the writer presents it, namely, the new economy of grace.<a name=91:18></a> It

	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, shewing the entire misapplication in principle of the Psalms, the doctrine of the writer is, that Christ wrought His way by righteousness up to the point of meeting God, learned obedience, proved His perfectness, etc.<a name=92:7></a> It was not a need of, nor had He a claim on, mercy.<a name=92:8></a> He must make His way by obedience and righteousness; He extricated Himself by His own perfect obedience.<a name=92:9></a> Now what is remarkable in the Psalms is, that they constantly appeal to the mercy of God, putting it ever before His righteousness, as it will be with Israel in that day.<a name=92:10></a> It is this that distinguishes them: "God prepares their heart;" for they must come in under mercy, according to Romans 11.<a name=92:11></a> And this is the case in Psalm 6 itself, on which the writer comments, and where it is said, "Save me for thy mercies' sake.<a name=92:12></a>" It sets aside his whole principle of application to Christ.<a name=92:13></a>

		I will add also a few words on Jeremiah, which is also used to puzzle the minds of the saints.<a name=92:14></a> Recalling the fact, that the question is not, if Christ in spirit entered into the sorrows of Israel: I believe, that, as being always near to God, He could.<a name=92:15></a> The doctrine taught is that He was under wrath in a way we never can be, and did not suffer all its consequences but saved Himself from it.<a name=92:16></a>

		God had sanctified him for this (chapter 1: 5), and the nation would fight against him.<a name=93:1></a> (verse 19.<a name=93:2></a>) This is not sufferings as associated with them, but as separated from them, though <i>divinely</i> interested in them, that is, as a prophet.<a name=93:3></a> (Chapter 15: 15.<a name=93:4></a>) We have his trials under it; and what was the ground it went upon?<a name=93:5></a> Just so far as he was there in the Spirit of Christ.<a name=93:6></a> "Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of my heart .<a name=93:7></a>.<a name=93:8></a>.<a name=93:9></a> .<a name=93:10></a> I sat alone because of thy hand: for thou hast filled me with indignation.<a name=93:11></a>" Now, here he is filled with it.<a name=93:12></a> How?<a name=93:13></a> Is it by being naturally exposed and obnoxious to it, and extricating himself out of it?<a name=93:14></a> No, but as sanctified to it by God, and called by His name; it is as partaking of the word of God that he suffered, and suffered as far as that was the case, as Christ did.<a name=93:15></a> And this was the identification with Israel which made him suffer, according to the grace of God, and in spiritual understanding according to His mind; his heart and spirit being associated with them, according to God's love to them, and feeling their sorrow and their sins; the grace of God identifying itself in the prophet with the people as loved of Him -- suffering in their sorrows, and calling for judgment on them who wilfully opposed the testimony, despised the sorrower, and helped on the evil.<a name=93:16></a>

		But this was the opposite of suffering the inflictions of God's wrath from him as due to the people.<a name=93:17></a> Jeremiah 10: 24, 25, shews plainly the impossibility of such an idea of wrath, so due and escaped from: "O Lord, correct me, but with judgment not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing.<a name=93:18></a>" Now, no such desire could be expressed as to inflictions of God's wrath, to which a man was naturally obnoxious.<a name=93:19></a> It looks for correction, but <i>not</i> in anger.<a name=93:20></a> No one could look for nor acquiesce in this way in the infliction of the curse of the law.<a name=93:21></a> And as to the Lamentations: that Jeremiah and the Lord Jesus entered into the sorrow of the actual wrath and evil that <i>had</i> fallen on Israel, who doubts?<a name=93:22></a> But this was not exposure to it from which the prophet preserved himself.<a name=93:23></a> His heart entered into it all, as sorrowing over what was loved of God but guilty, and with which he identified himself, being in such a case.<a name=93:24></a> Here also the enmity of ungodly Jews is not lost sight of.<a name=93:25></a> (Lamentations 3: 14.<a name=93:26></a>) Besides, here also mercy is what is referred to and expected, not wrath due and avoided in a measure, but suffering felt from wrath executed, and looking to mercy out of it, because of God's

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This was taken notice of, and the cases of Christ's loving the young man, and His reference to His mother on the cross, were referred to, as proving that He had those feelings: but the first was declared to be the love of election; and the second the divine nature suggesting what was right; but neither human feeling.<a name=94:6></a> The fire consuming the wood upon the altar was expounded, as shewing that God did consume nature, not sin merely as a thing hateful to Himself.<a name=94:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was assiduously taught in more than one place, that Abel's sacrifice was more abundant than Cain's, and that this, not its nature, was its superiority,<a href="#94:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> the word <i>pleiona</i> being relied on to prove it.<a name=94:8></a> Lecturing on Leviticus 1, it was taught that the preciousness of it was, that if our devotedness, though acceptable, was inadequate in quantity, the deficiency was made up by Christ's; and the peculiar preciousness of this was, that it was made up for by a thing of the like kind.<a name=94:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I feel bound to add, that the doctrine of the tract involves really, though more obscurely, the person of the Lord; because, it is stated that, as the Eternal Son, He had an unchangeable relation of favour; but, that as man, not vicariously, He was obnoxious to wrath.<a name=94:10></a> Now this divides the person entirely.<a name=94:11></a> That He took it vicariously, though in perfect favour Himself, is true; but that He was in favour as Eternal Son, and under wrath Himself as man, not vicariously, subverts the doctrine of the person of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=94:12></a> He is near as Eternal Son, and as man at a distance, not as a substitute.<a name=94:13></a>

		I repeat here, to facilitate the use of the Psalms, three things found in them: -- 1, The Spirit of Christ entering into the sorrows of the godly remnant of Israel, especially in the latter day; 2, His own grief and sorrow as in life down here (and oh!<a name=95:12></a> what sorrow, reproach, desertion, and treachery, for his tender and perfect spirit!<a name=95:13></a>), as well as going through this very place of the remnant in principle; 3, The atonement and sin-bearing, which enabled Him to use effectually for others His nearness to God, so that He could bring their sorrows as occasions of mercy, and give to them right feelings in the sense of sins as their drawing near to God.<a name=95:14></a> Of course, this develops itself largely in many ways as to suffering and feeling, while other psalms largely introduce the consequences in blessing -- Christ's coming in glory, who He is, and the circumstances and thoughts in the godly among the people connected with these things.<a name=95:15></a>

		<h3>A PLAIN STATEMENT, ETC.<a name=98:1></a></h3>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The author's doctrine is that Christ came by birth into man's relative condition as a sinner, and into Israel's under a broken law, making part thus of an accursed people; that He was exposed to, and threatened by, obnoxious to, the consequences of this position -- not vicariously, but as being one of them, but preserved Himself in a measure from those consequences, and extricated Himself out of that condition, by His life under the law, which was strong to Him though weak to us, and subsequently underwent what was due to it vicariously on the cross; that is, that Christ was subject, not vicariously but as associated with us, to damnation and wrath, but freed Himself from it by keeping the law; that what He suffered when in this position during the first thirty years of His life was the infliction of God upon His soul; not entering into the condition of man in spirit, though this might be true too; and that He got out of this condition, this relation to God, at John's baptism (though in this he contradicts himself).<a name=98:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And here I press on the reader always to bear in mind that Christ is stated to have been exposed or obnoxious to this from His birth -- not perhaps to have endured it all, which shews that it is not His spirit entering into it, but exposed and obnoxious to it; that it is distinguished as inflictions by God, even when felt, from exercises of His own soul; that these inflictions were under law, not under love.<a name=98:3></a> Let him remark also that sinless penalties, though freely spoken of to confound the reader, have nothing to say to the matter.<a name=98:4></a> Christ did not extricate Himself from them; hunger and thirst and weariness were His portion all through; nor is that the meaning of the curse of the law.<a name=98:5></a> Saint and sinner are alike subject to them.<a name=98:6></a> Jesus might have felt their true character as, though more deeply than, the saints will; but this is not an infliction from God on His soul.<a name=98:7></a> All this is an attempt to throw dust in the eyes.<a name=98:8></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#107:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>This passage is plain enough. There was no point where God could meet Jesus as a man, till He had worked His way up to the wrath of God which was due to man. This is neither entering into sorrows nor appropriation of anything. Jesus as man was there. To reconcile this with His deliverance from Sinai to Zion, and change of relationship with God, by John's baptism, is not for me to undertake. In either case the doctrine is substantially the same. Jesus was, not as a substitute but as a man and as an Israelite, under that wrath which was measured, if infinite can be said to be measured, in His sufferings in death on the cross; and He worked His way up out of it -- "rose out of that region" -- "emerged" out of it -- "extricated" Himself from it. Only here no room is left for His afterwards undergoing it vicariously; for He suffered death as part of the obedience necessary to get at the point of meeting. Save this very important point, it is the doctrine of the author in his article in the "*Christian Witness*," in the second edition.

		I shall now quote a passage which, while confirming the statements as to Christ being relatively by birth at man's distance from God, shews that all attempt to attract the affections of the saint by the notion of Christ's soul entering into our sorrow, and our fellowship in His sufferings by the Spirit, is really the merest deceit.<a name=110:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"His servants ["Observations," page 35], such for example as St Paul, may follow their Master in drinking in their more feeble measure of the cup of others' woe; they may suffer much with others, and for the sake of others; they may also have exercises of spirit; but none excepting Jesus ever had His soul exercised in the same manner (for the dispensation was one of law), nor with the same intensity -- the intensity of truth.<a name=110:3></a> The Lord Jesus was as much alone, in His living estimate under God's hand of the circumstances of human life here, as in enduring wrath upon the cross.<a name=110:4></a> He who, before He was made flesh, had known all the heights of uncreated and eternal glory; was also, when here, made to estimate according to the sensibilities of that nature, which He had taken, the (to us) inconceivable<a href="#110:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> distance of humanity from God.<a name=110:5></a> And when thus exercised, though personally holy and beloved, He was made to feel that His association with them, thus standing in the fearfulness of their distance from God, was a real thing, and that it was so regarded by God.<a name=110:6></a> His was no mere pretended imaginary association.<a name=110:7></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence all such language as that, "To know the fellowship of His sufferings, as well as the power of His resurrection, was the desire of one who was wise in Christ, wise in seeking the true riches -- one who has told us to imitate him as he imitated Christ" (page 62) -- such words, I say, are merely seeking to delude, because he has told us (pages 35, 36) that this very Paul, to whom he alludes, could not possibly have anything to say to the sufferings of which he is treating in these tracts, any more than he could to those of the cross.<a name=110:8></a> So also he says (note to page 58), "though our experiences are very unlike to His" (Christ's).<a name=110:9></a> And hence, also, all that is said (page 57), "when believers now are exercised in spirit, when they are caused to feel -- to feel perhaps

	<div class="paragraph">
		Mark the note too to page 57, where it is sought to be said, that it is not "implied that such exercises, whether in our Lord or in ourselves [we have seen that we cannot be in those in which Christ was], had anything to do with atoning for sin" -- then it would not be mysticism merely, but direct heresy and sin.<a name=111:8></a> "Without shedding of blood there is no remission.<a name=111:9></a>" Now if Christ came under "man's doom," under the reckoned or imputed guilt of Adam, though not a sinner, how did He get out of it?<a name=111:10></a> By keeping the law.<a name=111:11></a> He rose out of that region, that is, through these very sufferings, "for the dispensation [p.<a name=111:12></a> 36] was one of law, in which He exposed Himself to the danger of receiving all the punishment which followed upon the imputation of Adam's offence.<a name=111:13></a> But though exposed to it, yet He rose above it all, because He was by birth the holy One made under the law.<a name=111:14></a>" "'This do and thou shall live,' was unto Him a word of delivering power.<a name=111:15></a>" "He would not have been punished at all, unless He had freely chosen, whilst standing as the 'justified one,' to offer atonement to the Father.<a name=111:16></a>" So that the imputation of sin was got rid of by another means than by shedding of blood.<a name=111:17></a> Where the imputation was to be altered nothing.<a name=111:18></a> Christ's being exposed to it (as we well know by the cross) could not set aside God's eternal principles.<a name=111:19></a>

		That paragraph begins thus: "And here let me state a point of greater importance; namely, that what the Lord meant by building His Church upon the rock is a totally different thing from the representation made in this tract.<a name=113:8></a>" It is a discussion on the import of Christ's words in Matthew 16: 18.<a name=113:9></a> The reader will judge how far Mr.<a name=113:10></a> Newton's statements are honest from the following facts.<a name=113:11></a> Mr.<a name=113:12></a> Newton declares that, the Hagar vessel in which the Jews were being wrecked, John Baptist was on the sand, and Peter gathered by Christ on the Rock.<a name=113:13></a> The author of the Reply says, If you mean really safety, or being saved by having an interest in Christ, Abel, Abraham, and John Baptist, were all on the Rock as well as Peter himself.<a name=113:14></a> If you speak of being really gathered to safety, how can you speak of John Baptist being on the sand?<a name=113:15></a> If you speak of the ground of safety as to actual accomplishment then you must bring in the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ: without which safety cannot be, or you make incarnation sufficient to save without blood-shedding and resurrection.<a name=113:16></a> Hence Christ says, I <i>will</i> build my Church.<a name=113:17></a> If you mean in God's mind, every saved one in all times was on the Rock as much as Peter.<a name=113:18></a> And in truth a more absurd, and unsound, contradictory statement could not well be than the Wreck and the Rock.<a name=113:19></a> For, as a system of argument, it put John Baptist expressly and in fact all the saints previously, out of safety and off the Rock of salvation.<a name=113:20></a> In reasoning on this, the author of the Reply says, that when in Matthew 16: 18 the Lord speaks of building on the rock, He speaks of a thing future, I <i>will</i> build, and not of what He was then doing.<a name=113:21></a> And as to the point in question he says, "But, first of all, the disciples of Jesus were not gathered on the Rock in His lifetime in the sense of Matthew 16.<a name=113:22></a>" Because to begin the building actually He must be dead and risen, the firstborn of the dead, the Head of the body of the Church.<a name=113:23></a>

See "Answer to the Second Letter to the Brethren and Sisters," etc. As to having life from the Son of man, I can find nothing about it in anything I have written on the subject.

		NOTICE OF THE STATEMENT AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF ERROR CIRCULATED BY MR. NEWTON
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Mr.<a name=117:1></a> Newton having addressed "A Statement and Acknowledgment" respecting certain doctrinal errors to very many brethren (so, indeed, as to have reached, directly or indirectly, almost all), I desire to make some remarks upon it.<a name=117:2></a> I do not doubt many are quite able to judge of its value.<a name=117:3></a> Still, as there are very many ignorant of the real point and bearing of the error, and on whom the idea of an acknowledgment would act so as to set their mind at ease, and that from a disposition (which every one would hail) to receive in grace the confession of error or fault, I feel it right, for the sake of the beloved church of God, to weigh its value.<a name=117:4></a> I am aware that I shall be considered relentless; but I think of the interest of the church of God in it, and even of Mr.<a name=117:5></a> Newton's own.<a name=117:6></a> If the Spirit of God be really working in his mind, the pointing out the deficiency of this will not hinder his going farther; and as the evil is confessedly very great, and specially as it is sought to be excused by the fact, that many brethren did not find it out, it is worth while, for the sake of simple and unsuspecting minds, to enquire seriously if it is really abandoned, and to what extent.<a name=117:7></a>
	</div>

		I proceed then at once to say (for I am satisfied that the plainest way is the most charitable here), that it is impossible that anything can be more unsatisfactory in every way; and I shall now say why.<a name=117:8></a> Mr.<a name=117:9></a> Newton has taught that Christ was, from the position He was in by birth as a man and an Israelite, under the curse of the exiled family, not vicariously on the cross, but in His own relation to God; that He was under the doom of death, under the curse of the law, and had to work His way up to a point where God could meet Him; that He had the experiences which an unconverted elect man, if he felt rightly, would have.<a name=117:10></a> These are not deductions, but the statements of Mr.<a name=117:11></a> Newton himself.<a name=117:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Besides this the "Christian Witness" furnished the evidence that this view of Christ's position has been originally based on an application of Romans 5, which subjected Christ to the

		imputation of Adam's guilt.<a name=118:1></a> This last, which gave so horrible a character to the doctrine itself as to shock everybody, is withdrawn, but the doctrine of the tracts is not withdrawn at all.<a name=118:2></a> The imputation of Adam's guilt was not the point taught in the tracts -- was not presented as the basis of the doctrine taught in them.<a name=118:3></a> They were an attempt to maintain all that Mr.<a name=118:4></a> Newton taught as to Christ, the basis formerly laid in the "Christian Witness" being withdrawn.<a name=118:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The "Statement and Acknowledgment" now gives up professedly what was already given up silently in the tracts, the doctrine itself, as to what Christ was, being now based in the "Statement" on another and a new ground: but it does not give up the doctrine itself at all, but quite the contrary; it maintains it distinctly on a new ground, more subtle and less apparently offensive in its character, and most carefully limits the confession of error to what was made the ground of the doctrine in the "Christian Witness.<a name=118:6></a>" Pages 3, 4, Mr.<a name=118:7></a> N.<a name=118:8></a> says, "It was this that first introduced Romans 5 into the controversy, as shewing that death of the body resulted from that which one man had done;<a href="#118:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> and if due care had been taken to discriminate between the mode in which the consequences of Adam's transgression reached mankind through federal headship, and the manner in which the Lord Jesus took certain of these consequences upon Himself, but not through federal headship -- the error which I now have to confess would have been avoided.<a name=118:9></a> If I had watched this, I should have carefully avoided referring that part of Romans 5 to the Lord Jesus, and I should have stated, that His connection with these consequences was in virtue of His being made of a woman, and thus having brought Himself into association with a race on whom these penalties were resting.<a name=118:10></a>" Now, here, Christ's connection with the consequences before attributed to the imputation of Adam's guilt is reaffirmed, and based on another ground.<a name=118:11></a> It is true, "certain consequences" leaves room enough to bring in anything, or leave out anything; but lower down we have "in virtue of such association He partook of these consequences, even all the consequences in which He could share unconnected with personal sin.<a name=118:12></a>" Now, this is not retracting the

	<div class="paragraph">
		And here I beg, too, to draw attention to another point.<a name=119:16></a> Mr.<a name=119:17></a> Newton grounds his statement and new views on the distinction between the imputation of Adam's guilt and association with his penal condition by birth (a wonderfully narrow distinction, more fitted to save the credit of the doctrine than the glory of the person of the blessed Jesus): but there is another ground on which Christ's liability to condemnation -- the horrible and frightful doctrine of His being Himself a condemned and lost man -- exists in the tracts (not one atom of which is recalled), and that is, that He was born an Israelite under the curse of a broken law.<a name=119:18></a> This is the doctrine of the tracts.<a name=119:19></a> Now this, so far from being recalled, is really still maintained by confining retractations as to the law to the point of imputation of Adam's guilt.<a name=119:20></a> It is said, page 6, "Nor yet that He had by keeping the law, or by anything else, to deliver Himself from such<a href="#119:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a> imputation or from its consequences.<a name=119:21></a>" Now Mr.<a name=119:22></a> Newton declares in the tracts, that Christ was born under the curse of the broken law, according to Galatians 3, and that He found His way to a point where God could meet Him; all this remaining in its full force unretracted.<a name=119:23></a>

		OBSERVATIONS ON "A STATEMENT FROM CHRISTIANS IN EBRINGTON STREET"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I trust, that, in -- to me at any rate -- the remarkable work which the Lord is now doing in the deliverance of valued brethren from the recognized snare of the enemy into the blessed liberty of grace and truth, I may be enabled to wait as patiently on that grace, through unfeigned faith in it, as I have felt it right to be active when I was satisfied the power of the enemy was at work.<a name=126:1></a> Where our blessed God deigns graciously to be at work, we may surely trust Him to bring it to a good and happy end.<a name=126:2></a> But where the enemy is still at work, there I feel the same cause for activity as ever.<a name=126:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the "Statement from Christians in Ebrington Street, Plymouth," is, I am satisfied, distinctly marked by the power of the same evil spirit which so many now recognize to have been at work -- disingenuousness, subtlety, reserving all the error possible, while the credit of those concerned is sought to be maintained, a Christ, or that which bears His name, which is no real living Christ of faith, accompanied by professions calculated to blind the simple and unwary.<a name=126:4></a> By whom drawn up I know not, or what Christians profess it, or how far to be taken as a profession of the assembly, or for the assembly by those who now assume to guide them, I know not, nor can anyone; nor know what authority to attach to an unsigned document.<a name=126:5></a> I can deal only with the document itself.<a name=126:6></a> It is said, "We can and do say that we have no wish to cloke or defend error;" but as to who can and do say it, we are left entirely in the dark.<a name=126:7></a> Still, in the Lord's hands, I believe this mysterious way of presenting it a mercy.<a name=126:8></a> I turn to the document.<a name=126:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A system of doctrine has been denounced, as is well known, by those who have recently left the assembly and others.<a name=126:10></a> "This system," the "Statement" tell us, "it is said, involves these errors," etc.<a name=126:11></a> I need not repeat them here.<a name=126:12></a> "With regard to these errors, we desire to state, that the great majority amongst us were wholly ignorant of their existence, so that the assertions made touching 'our having lost Christ,' or having had presented to us a 'false Christ' for years past, were assertions

		Now that damnable heresies are brought in privily there cannot be a doubt, and that many children of God escape many of the real and legitimate consequences of error because of positive truth already in their hearts I thankfully admit, and I dare say it has been the case with many of the poor of the flock in this case, and I bless God for it.<a name=127:2></a> But what are the facts here?<a name=127:3></a> First, more than two hundred persons had left the assembly, of whom a vast body felt that practically they had lost Christ; many had more definite reasons, no doubt, but with some that was practically the whole matter.<a name=127:4></a> Spiritual sense made them feel Christ was gone though they might not have been able to explain what had taken Him away.<a name=127:5></a> And they were right.<a name=127:6></a> God constantly thus guides His flock.<a name=127:7></a> "A stranger will they not follow, for they know not the voice of a stranger.<a name=127:8></a>" They cannot tell who the stranger is, but it is not the Shepherd's voice.<a name=127:9></a> Many taunted them with this being no reason.<a name=127:10></a> It was a divine Spirit-taught reason, and God has justified them.<a name=127:11></a> But to proceed.<a name=127:12></a>

		And note further here, there is subtlety as well as dishonesty.<a name=128:24></a> In page 3, the imputation of guilt to Christ, taught and circulated all over the kingdom, and far beyond its limits, by those who learned it in Ebrington Street, is declared to have been seen erroneous, and to have been confessed by those who once held it.<a name=128:25></a> But as to the law and its curse, it is said, we believe that this was not held by any amongst us.<a name=128:26></a> Indeed!<a name=128:27></a> And what are Mr.<a name=128:28></a> N.<a name=128:29></a>'s tracts and lectures?<a name=128:30></a> Will the assembly say that he is not amongst them?<a name=128:31></a> Or what mean the confessions of their teachers?<a name=128:32></a> "Indefinite thoughts which individuals may have entertained, or do entertain," are spoken of.<a name=128:33></a> And what of the "Remarks and Observations?<a name=128:34></a>" And if individuals amongst them (and clearly teachers, for the mass were totally ignorant of the doctrines) do hold indefinite thoughts about Christ's being under the curse of the law, Christ is lost, or a false Christ proclaimed.<a name=128:35></a> For a Christ born under the curse of the law in His own position is a false Christ; and indefinite thoughts in that prove that a man has no Christ at all; and to talk about it in such a way proves something very like indifference to it in those who drew up the paper.<a name=128:36></a> And mark, retraction or confession, or anything explicit

	<div class="paragraph">
		But I go farther, and I say, the true Christ, a known Christ, is lost in this very paper.<a name=129:4></a> I read, from page 9, "He voluntarily subjected Himself to all these things which were involved in such connections, so far as it pleased God His Father for Him to be placed in them.<a name=129:5></a>" Now in this diplomatic sentence, this shameful sentence to have written about the blessed Lord, what was Christ's place?<a name=129:6></a> There is not one positive word of faith about Christ in it.<a name=129:7></a> It is declared that "this voluntary position could in no way affect the dignity of His person or perfectness of His work, nor yet could it indicate that something was laid on Him which He had to remove before He could become our substitute and sin-bearer.<a name=129:8></a>" That is what I will tell you when you tell me what the position was which He did take.<a name=129:9></a> But you have left me without any Christ at all, but a possible one, who was "subjected to all things which were involved in such connections" -- connections with sinful man and cursed Israel, mark, "so far as it pleased God His Father for Him to be placed in them.<a name=129:10></a>" But how far was He in them?<a name=129:11></a> Have you nothing positive?<a name=129:12></a> Is it an unknown possibility of the Father's will, the measure of Christ's connections with sin and the curse?<a name=129:13></a> Was the connection -- positively held as a doctrine by some amongst you, and taught, and printed, and applied to the interpretation of the whole book of Psalms -- was that possible to be the Father's pleasure, or the Son of God's place!<a name=129:14></a> Is there no revelation of what were the connections with man and Israel, in which the blessed Lord was placed?<a name=129:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But you come and tell us that whatever Christ experienced, or in whatever way it pleased God His Father for Him to be placed in connection with man and Israel, it could in no possible way affect His person or work.<a name=130:9></a> How came it to do so, in what has been retracted?<a name=130:10></a> and how can I trust you in the dark for this vague unknown Christ, whose position, you tell me, cannot, and will not affect His person and work?<a name=130:11></a> You must let me know what your Christ is first.<a name=130:12></a> And so carefully do you guard this vague open door, that you tell us you cannot "know any further than God has been pleased to reveal by His Spirit in the word, and what it was proper for Christ to feel <i>or not to feel</i>" -- the italics are yours.<a name=130:13></a> But do you know of nothing in the word which is revealed as to what He <i>did not</i> feel?<a name=130:14></a> The experience of an unconverted elect man, for instance?<a name=130:15></a> Is this the way you speak of Christ still?<a name=130:16></a> You are discussing what it was <i>proper</i> for Him to feel, instead of learning and believing in what the living Christ was.<a name=130:17></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is the more necessary you should explain this, not only because my questions apply to doctrines which have been diligently taught among you, as to which your statements have an alarming vagueness, but because in this very passage you speak of "experiences which it may have pleased the Father that He should pass through," which could not involve "the rejection of His true experiences as the Son.<a name=131:8></a>" Now I avow to you such an expression, instead of clearing up your views, looks largely tainted with the abominable and frightful doctrine long taught among you.<a name=131:9></a> And this accompanied by a very anxious effort to shew that nothing you may hold could or would involve anything that affected the doctrine of Christ, and the absence of stating what you do hold, and of the refutation of what has been taught on the experiences of Christ, and on the contrary leaving the most open door possible for holding anything, only assuring us that whatever it may be it cannot affect Christ, only tends to confirm the conviction that you are still, as an assembly, under the power of Satan.<a name=131:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The entire want of candour and honesty as to what has been taught, printed, circulated, put in tracts, and confessed by your teachers, only painfully confirms this sad conviction.<a name=131:11></a> And, as undoubtedly convinced of it, I warn all who are among you solemnly of it, and exhort and call upon all who value Christ and their own souls to come out and partake no longer of the sins of the assembly, that they may have nothing to do with the judgments which belong to such evil.<a name=131:12></a> You, who are Christians, do you not yet see the hand of the Lord is out against all the system, though in love surely to His own?<a name=131:13></a> I do not charge all in the assembly as intentionally involved in their errors.<a name=131:14></a> Nor do I with the subtlety of this paper, which is an additional reason for having done with those who drew it up.<a name=131:15></a> You were ignorant perhaps of the errors, as those misled usually are; but if those

	<div class="paragraph">
		I feel bound to add that the positive doctrine stated is unsatisfactory on two material points, particularly important to notice from the doctrines which have been taught, as they tend to confirm my conviction that those who have drawn up this paper are not free from the evil or from the influence of Satan.<a name=132:8></a> That Christ was truly a man, born of a woman, born under the law, is of the very essence of our faith -- tempted in all points like as we are, yet without (apart from) sin; all this is the revealed comfort to the soul.<a name=132:9></a> But the statements of page 5, as to it, will be found to have, very many of them, no scripture to base them on.<a name=132:10></a> Hebrews 2: 14 does not make the statement here made but a very definite one -- not the one found here.<a name=132:11></a> The statement as to Christ's death, on its only ground, I judge to shew equally defective views, though meant to guard against the charge of holding error.<a name=132:12></a> He could only die as bearing the sins of others seems to guard Christ's death, but it makes it an imposed and necessary consequence.<a name=132:13></a> Now, though "if He took the sins, He could only expiate them by death," it was not the whole character of His death or taken by itself a true one.<a name=132:14></a> They have ventured too far in mental dealing with the blessed Saviour, and we always lose Christ, the true Christ, when we do.<a name=132:15></a> It is an unsound exposition of Christ's nature and death.<a name=132:16></a> But further, the second point is this: "while He, in living obedience, was working out that one righteousness in which we stand as believers in His name.<a name=132:17></a>" This last, too, specially connects itself with the errors which have been taught.<a name=132:18></a>

		REMARKS ON "A LETTER ON SUBJECTS CONNECTED WITH THE LORD'S HUMANITY"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The reader will meet with some remarks in a part of this tract which -- if not accustomed to abstract reasoning -- he will probably have difficulty in understanding.<a name=134:1></a> I add these few lines to say, he need not be the least uneasy at it; probably it is so much the better for himself.<a name=134:2></a> Abstract discussions on the nature of the Lord Jesus are, I believe, very unhealthful things for the soul; and if, in the form of a positive attempt to define incarnate Godhead -- always erroneous in some expression or other -- what may be found difficult of apprehension in these pages (and it is chiefly in a note) is introduced with no such object, but merely to shew the fallacious ground of reasoning taken, in order to introduce error.<a name=134:3></a> When there were minds exercised on it, it was right to notice this; when this is not the case, the reader will be only so much the happier to rest in his simplicity, and believe, with confiding faith, in the testimony of the word, that the Word was made flesh and dwelt amongst us, full of grace and truth; -- and that, as the children whom He was bringing to glory partook of flesh and blood, He partook of it too: and, while knowing that the blessed One was absolutely, and in every sense, without sin, be assured that He knows how to speak a word in season to him that is weary -- to sympathise with every sorrow -- and to relieve and lift up in every infirmity -- having suffered, being tempted, and thus able to succour them that are tempted.<a name=134:4></a>

	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#138:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>Note here, His being a *man* did not make Him suffer. Adam, before his fall, was as much a man as after. If Christ suffered, *because* He was a man, it only means a man under the same necessity and relationship to God as Adam in sin. The reader will do well to bear in mind this. Sin did not make Adam a man, but placed man in a certain position before God. The question *is*, Did Christ take in His life the position of the sinner, as such, before God? Mr. N. held that He did, and worked His way out of it; sometimes stating He got out of it at John's baptism, at other times at the cross. Here, moreover, it *is* not merely that Christ suffered as in the service of God, but because He was a man. No one doubts He suffered, and must have been a man to suffer. But was He by necessity of condition, because He was a man, involved in all the consequences of sin? If it was because He was a man, He was -- and so indeed Mr. N. states in his tracts -- "exposed to" them, though He did not suffer all. Do not let the reader be misled by the word sinless. Damnation is not a sinful thing, it is very righteous. No penalty, as such, is sinful.

		<a class="footnote" name="#149:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>Hunger, thirst, uneasiness, are not a kind of humanity, but a state of circumstances in which it is placed. That Christ came into these circumstances is undoubted. I have not different humanity when I am hungry and when I am full. But I am placed in a condition in which hunger and starvation may fall upon me if God so permits. Who will say if Adam had not had food he would not have been hungry? But God had not set him in that condition. Further, even as to death, there is much misapprehension. No creature is, in itself, in a state which cannot perish. That is the condition of existence of God alone, "who only hath immortality." If Adam was not mortal before he sinned, it was by God's continual sustaining power -- we may say, by Christ's. By God's appointment, when man sinned, he passed out of that state of continually sustained existence, and was not to continue beyond a limited period in his actual condition of existence. This was not humanity, but man's state, as such, when Christ came. Now, Christ came expressly to die, and took all this sorrow in its full weight upon His soul; He was made a little lower than the angels, for the suffering of death. But His doing this in obedience, "Lo I come to do thy will," to glorify God and manifest and accomplish His love, exalt His righteousness and be the suffering vessel of witness to the claims of this necessity, was infinitely acceptable to God, so that His relationship to God as being in flesh, and by being in it, was one of infinite acceptability to God. But, though He came on purpose to die, because of the ruined condition in which man was, to raise His people, and so was in a capacity of dying, as made lower than the angels, yet it was in such sort that it should be a matter of pure grace in Him to give up His life. He laid it down of Himself. He had authority to lay it down and authority to take it again, still in obedience. "This commandment have I received of my Father." That was the real condition of Christ's death. He came to die, but He came to give His life. He had life in Himself. The condition of His existence here was to lay down by grace, obediently, but of Himself, His life. He was not, as of God, in a condition of losing it. He was not in Adam's condition. For Adam could not lay down as Christ, or take again his life, nor had he life in himself. To speak of Him as liable to death, if something had happened, is mere irreverence -- He was in a position of commanding His own death and life, but could do this, because of His perfection, only in obedience to His Father's will -- it is nonsense; because in the supposition is denied the condition of His existence, which was to lay it down; and, as I have said, if Adam had so lived under violence, and been hewed in pieces, would He have survived as a living man? The answer was, That was not His condition of existence. When Christ gave Himself up to the appointed consequences of sin, He took the wrath and the consequences. He came with that purpose, so that it was always before Him. His relationship to God in this (yea, because of this) was of infinite acceptance; not only because He was eternal Son of God, the title of which He did not forego, as towards God, in assuming flesh, but was in His acceptance all through. But the position itself that He assumed was a cause of infinite acceptance, and in that He stood as man even in what He suffered. "Therefore doth my Father love me."

		Beloved Brethren,<p>I feel bound to present to you the case of Bethesda.<a name=164:1></a> It involves to my mind the whole question of association with brethren, and for this very simple reason, that if there is incapacity to keep out that which has been recognized as the work and power of Satan, and to guard the beloved sheep of Christ against it -- if brethren are incapable of this service to Christ, then they ought not to be in any way owned as a body to whom such service is confided: their gatherings would be really a trap laid to ensnare the sheep.<a name=164:2></a> But I will not suppose this, my heart would not; nor will I suppose that the influence or reputation of individuals will induce them to do in one case what they would not do in another.<a name=164:3></a> I press therefore the position of Bethesda on brethren.<a name=164:4></a> It is at this moment acting in the fullest and most decided way as the supporter of Mr.<a name=164:5></a> Newton, and the evil associated with him, and in the way in which the enemy of souls most desires it should be done.<a name=164:6></a> The object of Mr.<a name=164:7></a> Newton and his friends is not now openly to propagate his doctrine in the offensive form in which it has roused the resistance of every godly conscience that cared for the glory and person of the blessed Lord, but to palliate and extenuate the evil of the doctrine, and get a footing as Christians for those who hold it, so as to be able to spread it and put sincere souls off their guard.<a name=164:8></a> In this way precisely Bethesda is helping them in the most effectual way they can: I shall now state how.<a name=164:9></a> They have received the members of Ebrington Street with a positive refusal to investigate the Plymouth errors.<a name=164:10></a> And at this moment the most active agents of Mr.<a name=164:11></a> Newton are assiduously occupied amongst the members of Bethesda, in denying that Mr.<a name=164:12></a> Newton holds errors, and explaining and palliating his doctrines, and removing any apprehension of them from the minds of saints, and successfully occupied in it.<a name=164:13></a> Mr.<a name=164:14></a> Mller has declared openly that Mr.<a name=164:15></a> James Harris was doing a work of darkness, the steps he took in exposing Mr.<a name=164:16></a> Newton's error, though he had not given himself the trouble to enquire, from those acquainted with them, the circumstances under which it took place.<a name=164:17></a> Mr.<a name=164:18></a> Mller stated to the saints that Mr.<a name=164:19></a> Newton had retracted publicly before God and the world, with the fullest confession, the error he had held; which every one acquainted with the facts knows to be as contrary to those facts as any statement can possibly be.<a name=164:20></a> And I must add that Mr.<a name=164:21></a> Mller, in

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Mr.<a name=172:1></a> Benjamin Newton combated the Irvingite error in England; but in combating, he was unhappy enough perhaps to yield to it a little in expression more than fundamentally.<a name=172:2></a> He owned it afterwards and even humbled himself for it in a paper which he entitled: 'A Statement and Acknowledgment respecting certain doctrinal errors.<a name=172:3></a>' In this document, dated November 26, 1847, he declares that what drew him into the error was a false view of Romans 5, but that a deeper study of this passage was afterwards used to rectify his misapprehension.<a name=172:4></a> He understood and taught from that time that, Jesus not being in a federal relation (in a relation of alliance) with Adam, Romans 5: was not at all applicable to Him; that the sin of our first father could not be imputed to Him, and that if the Lord participated in certain consequences of the fall, such as hunger, thirst, pain, death, it is that, having voluntarily taken human nature in the womb of the woman, He had personally associated Himself with a race condemned of God.<a name=172:5></a> Such is the idea that Mr.<a name=172:6></a> Benjamin Newton develops at length in the above-mentioned paper.<a name=172:7></a> (Some persons none the less persist in attributing to him until this day an error which he publicly disavowed already five years ago.<a name=172:8></a>)"

		Your animosity must have been very great, my brother, against "some persons," to engage yourself, in the desire of blaming them, in becoming guarantee for the orthodoxy of Mr.<a name=172:9></a> Newton, and in compromising your own by making yourself thus at one with his views on the point to which you allude.<a name=172:10></a> The displeasure with which you regard those brethren has made you bold, even, it seems to me, a little rash.<a name=172:11></a> There is hardly any longer a person in England who justifies the doctrine of Mr.<a name=172:12></a> Newton.<a name=172:13></a> Those who take pleasure as much as you in blaming "some persons" do so while declaring that they are much more faithful than themselves in rejecting the errors of Mr.<a name=172:14></a> Newton and in abstaining from all fellowship with him.<a name=172:15></a> There is a long time that he hides his doctrine; it is even said (may God grant that it may be so!<a name=172:16></a>)

	<div class="paragraph">
		In a letter of 51 pages published since his retractation, Mr.<a name=186:5></a> Newton disavows formally the doctrine that the position in which Christ was found here below was the effect of the imputation of the sin of Adam.<a name=186:6></a> He declares that the true doctrine of imputation is entirely opposed to the radical principle of the tracts (those from which I have made extracts), namely, that of voluntary association .<a name=186:7></a>.<a name=186:8></a>.<a name=186:9></a> .<a name=186:10></a> "If I had held this doctrine, almost all that I have said in these tracts would have been upset in place of being what it is now.<a name=186:11></a> I have explained elsewhere how I have held it, in giving account of the fact that Christ had been associated with certain results of the sin of Adam, in consequence of His relation with Adam by Mary.<a name=186:12></a> I have ill-explained the thing and have used theological terms wrongly and have made a false application of Romans 5; in other words, I have confounded between transmitted consequences and imputation.<a name=186:13></a> I have owned elsewhere the sin of this negligence, etc .<a name=186:14></a>.<a name=186:15></a>.<a name=186:16></a> .<a name=186:17></a> with regard to the tracts, it is a question of facts and each will judge for himself, up to what point the relations of the Lord are, or are not, rightly stated.<a name=186:18></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		You will understand then that it is not a question here of saying that the divinity of the Saviour and His humanity are believed in, and His expiation on the cross (although this latter truth is entirely destroyed by the doctrine that we are exposing; for if Jesus found a way to God, and if it is only upon the cross, under wrath, that God could meet with Him <i>because He was man</i>, however innocent He might be, He could not make expiation).<a name=187:7></a> It is a question of the relation of Jesus with God outside substitution.<a name=187:8></a> Neither is it a question of denying the consequences, while holding the doctrine which leads to them; it is a question of what is taught.<a name=187:9></a>

		I think that I shall do well, in order to complete the evidence I have to present to you on this subject, to add the summary that one of Mr.<a name=188:6></a> Newton's fellow-workers in the teaching of this doctrine made of it in the retractation which he has published.<a name=188:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The doctrines of this system of teaching may be summed up thus: --
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1. That the Lord Jesus at His birth, and because born of a woman, partook of certain consequences of the fall, mortality being one, and, because of this association by nature, He became an heir of death, born under death as a penalty.<a name=188:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2. That the Lord Jesus at His birth stood in such relation to Adam as federal head, that guilt was imputed to Him, and that He was exposed to certain consequences of such imputation -- as stated in Romans 5.<a name=188:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3. That the Lord Jesus was also born as a Jew under the broken law, and was regarded by God as standing in that relation to Him; and that God pressed upon His soul the terrors of Sinai, as due to one in that relation.<a name=188:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4. That the Lord Jesus took the place of distance from God, which such a person so born and so related must take, and that He had to find His way back to God by some path in which God might at last own and meet Him.<a name=188:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5. That so fearful was the distance, and so real were these relationships by birth, and so actual were their attendant penalties of death, wrath, and the curse, that until His deliverance God is said to have rebuked Him, to have chastened Him, and this in anger and hot displeasure.<a name=188:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6. That because of these dealings from God, and Christ's sufferings under them, the language of Lamentations 3 and Psalms 6, 38, and 88, etc.<a name=188:13></a>, has been stated to be the utterance of the Lord Jesus while under this heavy pressure from God's hand.<a name=188:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7. That the Lord Jesus extricated Himself from these inflictions by keeping the law; and that at John's baptism the consequent difference in Christ's feelings and experience was so great as to have been illustrated by a comparison of the difference
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=189>[Page 189]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		between Mount Sinai and Mount Sion, or between law and grace.<a name=189:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8. That, beside all these relations which Christ took by birth, and their attendant penalties and inflictions, and His sufferings under the heavy hand of God, it has been further stated that He had the experience of an unconverted though elect Jew.<a name=189:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here you have a summary of this doctrine given us by one of those who has taught it himself, in conjunction with Mr.<a name=189:3></a> Newton.<a name=189:4></a> Everyone can see that it is a carefully matured system, and the different testimonies we possess leave no obscurity as to the foundation of the doctrine, whatever modification may have been applied to the expressions.<a name=189:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Two other brethren who taught these doctrines with Mr.<a name=189:6></a> Newton have published their retractation; but, at this moment, I am not in possession of their writings; they admit the same things.<a name=189:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second article is the one, and the only one, to which Mr.<a name=189:8></a> Newton's retractation of 1847 applies.<a name=189:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is the testimony of one strongly opposed to me, respecting the tracts, the retractation, and the letter published by Mr.<a name=189:10></a> Newton since the retractation: --
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"The third tract of Mr.<a name=189:11></a> Newton had been published, his two preceding tracts had been sanctioned after having been considered anew; his retractation, or confession of November, 1847, was thus, save in words, annulled, and worse than annulled.<a name=189:12></a> The errors, whatever be otherwise their bearing, without any doubt touch the foundations of our faith, and by this means overthrow, not only the unity of the church, but its very existence.<a name=189:13></a>"

		ON AITKENISM
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Mr.<a name=190:1></a> Aitken's system may be briefly stated: --
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Spiritual life and forgiveness, or salvation, are communicated by faith, or in accordance with faith; where a man has repented fully, and, crying to God for salvation, goes out of self for it and believes in the atonement.<a name=190:2></a> But divine life or regeneration is quite another thing, possessed by few, communicated and sustained by the sacraments, but which is possessed only in the degree in which, by personal efforts, we die to self.<a name=190:3></a> This is the portion of an elect few who form the bride of Christ (not His spouse), the Church of the firstborn, who will reign with Him.<a name=190:4></a> We get the Spirit of adoption on receiving salvation; but we are born of God only by baptism, and thus, if it be developed by our own will or efforts, we are united to God and become God-men, not in the same degree but in the same manner as Christ.<a name=190:5></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All this is pursued out as a system with various adjuncts needless to mention, with a neglect of scripture or indeed proof of any kind, which ignorant assumption or uncommon self-confidence alone could account for.<a name=190:6></a> Those are in a nearer relationship to Christ, he says, who are in the Church (the Establishment), though dead in trespasses and sins, than a saved person who has spiritual life outside it.<a name=190:7></a> The baptized child receives life and is in a state of grace provisionally by special favour, though he has not faith; but in point of fact he always loses it, though he need not, and then is saved by faith, but is not regenerate.<a name=190:8></a> How this is afterwards procured does not clearly appear, and is not stated in the volume already out.<a name=190:9></a> Self-denial and sacraments are his general idea; but as baptism is the one for giving life and he cannot be baptized over again, we are left in the dark.<a name=190:10></a> You may ask but never expect proof of the difference between spiritual and divine life.<a name=190:11></a> Evangelicals are complained of who treat salvation as the end, and it is affirmed that we cannot have spiritual life and forgiveness, which are by faith alone, without being sure of it.<a name=190:12></a> Again, a separatist cannot have divine life or be of the <i>bride</i> of Christ, though he is of the body by baptism in spite of himself, for that tie is indissoluble.<a name=190:13></a> A man may lose spiritual life and salvation, but he cannot cease to be a member of Christ's body, and he is lost all the same.<a name=190:14></a> He reads "Ye are they who have followed me in the regeneration.<a name=190:15></a>"

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we take the figure of baptism, the statement that it is regeneration, while salvation is by faith, is overthrown by scripture.<a name=191:23></a> "Arise and be baptized, and <i>wash away thy sins</i>," etc.<a name=191:24></a> "According to his mercy <i>he saved us by the washing of regeneration</i>.<a name=191:25></a>" "The like figure whereunto, even baptism, doth also now save us.<a name=191:26></a>" Nor can it be alleged that this is the provisional salvation tacked to it in the case of infants, for adults are in question.<a name=191:27></a> It is the merest bubble of his own mind for one acquainted with scripture.<a name=191:28></a> His own prayer-book denies such distinctions.<a name=191:29></a> The prayer is that the infant may obtain remission of his sins by spiritual <i>regeneration</i>.<a name=191:30></a> Nor will the allegation that salvation is provisionally attached to it for infants hold good, for it is asked equally in baptism for riper years.<a name=191:31></a> It is prayed that they also may receive "remission of their sins by spiritual regeneration.<a name=191:32></a>" And to this John 3 is applied, which speaks of being born of the Spirit, and just as Peter who tells the repentant Jews to be baptized for the remission of their sins.<a name=191:33></a>

		On the other hand, I agree that it is terrible to make salvation, in the sense of being safe, the end of all.<a name=192:3></a> I agree that fasting and self-denial are excellent in their place; but all these distinctions of divine life and spiritual life, and subjection to ordinances as if the means of life come from the vagaries of the human mind or worse, not from God.<a name=192:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The rest of the passage in Titus 3 shews that the distinction of eternal life and regeneration is unknown to scripture.<a name=192:5></a> "He saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost; which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour, that, being justified by faith, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.<a name=192:6></a>" Here eternal life, justification by faith, regeneration, salvation, are all brought together in a way that makes Mr.<a name=192:7></a> A.<a name=192:8></a>'s reasoning hopelessly untenable.<a name=192:9></a> There might be conversions; because, while adding all his nonsense about sacraments, he preaches (though in an Arminian way) repentance toward God and salvation by faith in Christ -- indeed as to the last with much more positive reality than the evangelicals.<a name=192:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the beginning, it is said, there were several reasons why Christ could only have access to the outer court, and had to keep outside the holy and most holy place; Dr.<a name=195:6></a> Bonar then gives three: Personal, He was of the tribe of Judah; Ceremonial, He had no blood to offer;<a href="#195:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> Typical, He was loaded with our leprosy.<a name=195:7></a> This is found in pages 313, 314.<a name=195:8></a> When in the full flow of his subject, he says, "the one hindrance to His exercise of this, His divine right of entrance into the holiest of all, was our iniquity.<a name=195:9></a>" Then in page 325, the two others are forgotten.<a name=195:10></a> It may be alleged he was only speaking in the latter place of Him as God.<a name=195:11></a> But, then, if the holiest of all was really then the dwelling place of God, and God there so that He could not approach, as Jehovah He was there.<a name=195:12></a> But this is not true: the house was empty, swept, and garnished.<a name=195:13></a> His own body was the temple where Jehovah dwelt.<a name=195:14></a> There was no shechinah in the second temple.<a name=195:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is alleged that He never went to the holy places of Israel.<a name=195:16></a> Who says He did not?<a name=195:17></a> But let that pass.<a name=195:18></a> Did He come here to turn Israel back to old shadows, and typical service, and places <i>counted</i> holy by them?<a name=195:19></a> But among others He did not go to Bethlehem.<a name=195:20></a> What profound sense there is in this!<a name=195:21></a> If this was because it was already a holy place, He became the leprous and unclean thing in the holy place.<a name=195:22></a> Because it was so -- and all the imperial world was set in movement to have Him made leprous there -- I suppose to desecrate it!<a name=195:23></a> If it was His birth that had sanctified

		<a class="footnote" name="#195:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>It is hard to tell why. It was a typical high place and typical blood shedding sufficed, and that He could have offered. There was only one reason, He could not have the blood of a suited sacrifice to offer. He was not the typical high priest, nor a priest at all judicially; nor did any one go into the most holy place save the high priest, nor with blood into the holy place, save for the sin of the high priest or the whole people; but that shews the gross absurdity of the whole reasoning from beginning to end. To think that Christ should need His blood to enter the earthly sanctuary is worthy of this school alone.

	<div class="paragraph">
		He did not go into the temple, because it was impossible, and out of God's then order, and inconsistent with every Jewish and every Christian thought.<a name=196:3></a> If spoken of as God, He was there as far as God was there; but, as I have said, His body in this sense was the true temple: He calls it so.<a name=196:4></a> If as man, He was not a priest: there were other priests to do it, as the epistle to the Hebrews tells us.<a name=196:5></a> As come, He was not there to set up Judaism, but to submit to its order; as born under the law, His entering into the holy place would have been a gross violation of it.<a name=196:6></a> Was He there to establish the earthly system as a divine thing, to have His place and title as Son in an earthly sanctuary?<a name=196:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We are specially referred to Solomon's porch.<a name=196:8></a> It was the common place of assembly in the temple.<a name=196:9></a> Was His being there a proof He was a substitute under a curse?<a name=196:10></a> All the apostles were afterwards with one accord in Solomon's porch.<a name=196:11></a> Were they all substitutes under a curse?<a name=196:12></a> I will speak of the doctrine.<a name=196:13></a> I speak now of the ridiculous absurdity of such reasoning.<a name=196:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But further, it is still more absurd; because, if He were a leprous man, and keeping this always in view as to holy places, other holy places lepers might have gone to as much as anyone else; but the really holy place, in a Jewish sense, which a leper could not go to, was the temple, and there He came, and was in the crowd of the clean, for none else could go there.<a name=196:15></a> It is painful to have to meet all this folly, used to make a leprous man of the Lord.<a name=196:16></a> Leprosy was defilement, not merely a type of guilt; our Lord, therefore, took a defiled place.<a name=196:17></a> <i>Clean</i> persons could not have gone into the holy of holies: there we are told He could not go because He was leprous.<a name=196:18></a> Leprous persons could not go into the temple, or be amongst the crowd of clean Israel; but there He was, and that is a proof that He is leprous!<a name=196:19></a> and, strange to say, He drove the defilers out, because it was a holy place.<a name=196:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the true answer is simple.<a name=196:21></a> He came not to build up the holiness of Hebrons or Bethels: He went into the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, Galilee of the Gentiles, because it had been prophesied of Him, that the poor of the flock, who sat in darkness, might see that great light, and light spring up on those in the shadow of death.<a name=196:22></a> He was there because He was light, not because He was leprous.<a name=196:23></a> He left Judea because the Pharisees had heard that He made and baptized more disciples than John:

		If the reader ask what scripture is alleged for His being a substitute, or avoiding holy places on this ground -- which there was no ground for doing -- the only scripture is the one emanating from Dr.<a name=197:6></a> Bonar's private assertion.<a name=197:7></a> In God's word there is not a single trace of it.<a name=197:8></a> Dr.<a name=197:9></a> Bonar does not attempt to allege a symptom of scripture -- for the simplest reason: there is none to allege.<a name=197:10></a> It is simply an unholy fancy of Dr.<a name=197:11></a> Bonar's.<a name=197:12></a> But he does quote some scriptures as to Christ's state during His life: I will examine them.<a name=197:13></a>

		Hebrews 10 is solely occupied with the <i>sacrifice</i> of Christ.<a name=198:9></a> The point on which chapter 9 had insisted was that there was no forgiveness without blood-shedding, and that Christ must have suffered often if He had offered Himself -- "often" excluding all idea of forgiveness but by death.<a name=198:10></a> Chapter 10 then sets aside Jewish offerings, and substitutes a Christ come to do God's will, but speaks only and exclusively of His offering; by the which will we are sanctified by the offering of the body of Jesus Christ <i>once for all:</i> thereupon declaring that we have boldness to enter into the holiest <i>by the blood</i> of Jesus, by a new and living way which He has consecrated for us through the veil, that is to say, His flesh.<a name=198:11></a> That is, Dr.<a name=198:12></a> Bonar leaves out the one point on which the word of God insists; and introduces what it does not introduce but excludes.<a name=198:13></a> I can only say the word of God is pure.<a name=198:14></a> "Add thou not unto his words lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.<a name=198:15></a>" All this I must call wickedness.<a name=198:16></a>

		We speak of what belongs to the Church, according to the common use of language, when we really mean what belongs to those who compose it.<a name=202:2></a> And this has no great practical harm when it is not used to make the idea, exclusively as such, our only blessing.<a name=202:3></a> I might say, The corporation are very good men, when I mean the men that compose it.<a name=202:4></a> But when an idea newly acquired gets hold of the soul, men are apt to be exclusively full of it.<a name=202:5></a> It shuts out other important truths.<a name=202:6></a> If any one has been filled with the sense of the importance of the doctrine of the Church, I think I may say I have.<a name=202:7></a> But conscience is individual; justification is individual; sonship is individual; communion, in perhaps its most important and certainly necessary part, is individual.<a name=202:8></a> Take all the writings of the apostle John, and, unless one allusion to a local body, you would never know that a church existed.<a name=202:9></a> I never lose, or at any rate never should lose, the consciousness of being a member of Christ; as I have said, it throws, when I have it, its light on all.<a name=202:10></a> I add the idea of unity in the body to union in the family.<a name=202:11></a> I am one with all those who are my brethren.<a name=202:12></a> But surely there is a vast flood of unspeakable blessing in John, in whose writings the thought or name of the Church never comes.<a name=202:13></a> I speak of the Gospel and Epistles.<a name=202:14></a> All is individual there.<a name=202:15></a> Those who enjoy it being to the Church, and do not put themselves out of the Church mentally in enjoying it; but it is not, for all that, the less individual.<a name=202:16></a>

The question is, Is the Epistle addressed to believers or to unbelievers? I do not even admit that the remnant in the last day will be in the state of those here spoken of. These were yet unbelieving, with a full present Christianity; those, though not a freed people knowing salvation, will be a repentant and expectant people, otherwise prepared to say, "Blessed is he that cometh," etc. But, though confirmatory of what I say, this is not the question. These were unbelievers: is the Epistle addressed to such?

		But I anticipate a little the details, and will enquire now regularly what proofs the Epistle gives of being addressed to Christians, though not speaking of church privileges as such.<a name=204:1></a> The writer places himself amongst those he writes to.<a name=204:2></a> This is not denied, and is clear from the beginning of the second chapter.<a name=204:3></a> Was the writer among the unbelieving Jews?<a name=204:4></a> For it was addressed to some one <i>then</i>.<a name=204:5></a> Those addressed had received the teachings of the apostles.<a name=204:6></a> There was danger of letting them slip; but they had heard and received them.<a name=204:7></a> He speaks of the world to come, but was not in it, for Jesus was sitting at the right hand of God, all things being not yet under His feet.<a name=204:8></a> But he speaks for himself and those he writes to: "We see Jesus .<a name=204:9></a>.<a name=204:10></a>.<a name=204:11></a> crowned with glory and honour.<a name=204:12></a>" This last is an important point.<a name=204:13></a> Besides His divinity -- it is that which the first chapter insists on -- it is characteristic, specifically characteristic of the whole Epistle.<a name=204:14></a> I mean that Jesus was sitting at the right hand of the majesty in the heavens: <i>not</i>, after the destruction of His enemies, a priesthood of blessing on His own throne.<a name=204:15></a> Thus, in the wonderful statement in chapter 1: 3, the groundwork of the epistle, the place Christ is found in, is, having "by himself purged our<a href="#204:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> sins, he sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high.<a name=204:16></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The position which makes the basis of the whole Epistle is Christ's present position, not his Melchisedec position, but a heavenly Christ sitting at the right hand of God <i>on high.<a name=204:17></a> So</i> when the writer has gone through his doctrine on this subject, he gives the summing up of it: -- "We have such an high priest who is set at the right hand of the majesty in the heavens.<a name=204:18></a>" When His position is considered in reference to His manhood, as we have seen, all things are <i>not</i> put under His feet; He sits at the right hand of God till they are.<a name=204:19></a> We see Him crowned with glory and honour.<a name=204:20></a> He suffered being tempted here, that He may be able to succour those that are tempted.<a name=204:21></a> Neither the position nor the service has any possible application to a Melchisedec priesthood on earth.<a name=204:22></a> Temptation and conflict will not exist then.<a name=204:23></a> The Melchisedec priesthood, the writer agrees and insists on, is, in its exercise, after the destruction of all enemies; Satan will then be bound.<a name=204:24></a> Antichrist's time is not the time of

	<div class="paragraph">
		But I prefer at present to follow out the direct teaching of this Epistle, which makes all clear, if anything can, if there is spiritual intelligence.<a name=205:13></a> Further, then, in this chapter it is said, "Whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.<a name=205:14></a>" To whom does this apply?<a name=205:15></a> For whom is it written?<a name=205:16></a> Are unbelieving Jews, however inclined to listen, the house of Christ as the exalted Son of God?<a name=205:17></a> Are they to hold fast their profession, the beginning of their confidence and rejoicing of hope, firm to the end?<a name=205:18></a> The Jewish remnant is not, further, a partaker of the heavenly calling, but of the earthly.<a name=205:19></a> In a word, thus far we have Christ, not as Melchisedec priest, but as sitting at the right hand of God, the high priest of <i>our</i> profession; and those addressed are "partakers of the heavenly calling," and are to hold fast their first confidence.<a name=205:20></a> We, says the writer, are His house if we do.<a name=205:21></a> "Made partakers of Christ," which in English might embarrass a soul, offers no difficulty, but the contrary.<a name=205:22></a> It is final partaking with Him in glory, according to chapter 1: 9, where "fellows" is the same word.<a name=205:23></a> Some remarks on how far this chapter may subsequently suit the remnant in its use of the wilderness history I will make when I refer to that point.<a name=205:24></a>

		In chapter 5 the "for" of this first verse shews that the Aaronic priesthood was founded on this very principle.<a name=206:8></a> It is not Christ's priesthood itself, as the fifth verse very clearly and positively shews; but it takes the Aaronic priesthood as a sample of the thoughts of God in priesthood, clearly not Melchisedec priesthood.<a name=206:9></a> It was different from Christ's, inasmuch as the Aaronic priesthood had sympathy while in, and because they were in, the same weakness as the others who drew nigh to God; whereas Christ's priesthood is exercised in the heavens.<a name=206:10></a> The partaking of the sorrows, when here, fitted Him for it, as chapters 2: 18; 4: 15, 16 shew, and chapter 5: 7.<a name=206:11></a> But THESE took place in the days of His flesh before He became a priest.<a name=206:12></a> He became that when <i>perfected</i> on high, for "we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens.<a name=206:13></a>" This makes the place and nature of His priesthood as clear as possible.<a name=206:14></a> He was tempted and suffered here below, as we suffer, to be fitted for it, touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but He exercises it on high.<a name=206:15></a> These two points are the fundamental and essential ones of the doctrine of the Epistle, while it clearly states that it is for us.<a name=206:16></a> He is the high priest of our profession.<a name=206:17></a> He is the author of eternal salvation to all those who obey Him.<a name=206:18></a> That those whom the apostle thus addresses were Christians will appear in the strongest light from what is here and afterwards said of them -- Christians in danger of being led away by judaism and of apostatizing.<a name=206:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And now let the reader remark here what lies at the root of all this question.<a name=207:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have seen, as clearly as scripture could make it, a priesthood based on Christ's being exalted at the right hand of the majesty in the heavens on the one hand, and on His having been tempted and having suffered and having learned obedience here below in the days of His flesh on the other; the priest of our profession who has the heavenly calling; a priest, as we shall see, who is entered into the heavens as our forerunner; and able, as having suffered, to help those who are tempted; and this priest is the priest according to the order of Melchisedec.<a name=207:6></a> (See chapter 5: 7-10.<a name=207:7></a>) We have the whole process of His perfecting for priesthood; and then He is saluted of God a high priest after the order of Melchisedec.<a name=207:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Is it not perfectly clear that, though personally the priesthood be not after the order of Aaron, but a new one, the exercise of the priesthood is not after the similitude of Melchisedec?<a name=207:9></a> Save what belongs to the person, not one element of Melchisedec priesthood is here found.<a name=207:10></a> The priest is in heaven, and profits by sufferings experienced here below to succour a tempted and suffering people.<a name=207:11></a> So that we come boldly to the throne of grace.<a name=207:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I add to this, that it is after He has perfected the work of propitiation, chapter 1: 3 to chapter 2: 17, where reconciliation should be propitiation <i>(ilaschesthai)</i>; but His priesthood is wholly and expressly on high, and He is on no Melchisedec throne, no throne of His own at all, but on the Father's throne, on the right hand of the throne of God; not after His enemies are all subdued, but expecting till His enemies be made His footstool.<a name=207:13></a> His priesthood is this; <i>not</i> Melchisedec priesthood in its place or exercise.<a name=207:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I remark, further, that though the application of <i>every</i> blessing -- all the work of God in good from creation on -- is by the Spirit, yet that this truth is not taught here.<a name=207:15></a> The person who feels for us has had experience, so as to be able to feel for us.<a name=207:16></a> "Who is able to succour the tempted" is not the Spirit here, but Christ, and Christ as priest.<a name=207:17></a> And this is a most important thing.<a name=207:18></a> For the heart of the Christian Christ is an <i>object</i> of affection, which the Spirit -- though we are indebted to His working for every blessing -- cannot be.<a name=207:19></a>

		Such is the priesthood of Christ always in this Epistle, a present priesthood, a priesthood in heaven, a priesthood on the right hand of the majesty in the heavens, exercised there; a priesthood, not after the order of Aaron as to person or descent, but our Lord, priest on high after the power of an endless life, personally similar to, and after the order of, Melchisedec, but never introduced as exercising His priesthood after the pattern, or in the place, of Melchisedec; always, from chapters 2 and 3 as compared and contrasted with Aaron's, to lift Jewish Christians (for they were Jewish Christians specifically) then from Jewish habits of association with that which was on earth, in shewing a present priesthood exercised above the heavens, and to preserve them by grace from falling away from the heavenly things to what they were used to; and, I may add, to bring them out from, what they had hitherto stayed in, the camp -- outward association with Israel and a judged system, and by teaching, which, for us, is based on the truth, in its continual exercise, that He ever lives to do it, now as then.<a name=210:3></a> It is the exercise of a continual priesthood after He had offered up Himself once for all.<a name=210:4></a>

		It is well that the reader should remark, that though the sacrifice has been stated (it is spoken of in the very first chapter, so in the second, as it is again here), we have not one word as yet of being made perfect in fact or in conscience, but the priest's fitness for tempted exercised souls down here -- a priest who can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities.<a name=210:5></a> He is gone on high, but we have no perfecting by sacrifice, no appearing as yet in the presence of God for us.<a name=210:6></a> Though the value of His priesthood for tried ones, and its fitness, are fully stated, as yet it is not our perfectness, before God, but help for the feeble and tried, who need help and mercy.<a name=210:7></a> It is to this last that priesthood is applied, and priesthood at the right hand of God, on the right hand of the throne of majesty on high, <i>not</i> at all on any Melchisedec throne.<a name=210:8></a> And this application of the priesthood of Christ to our infirmities and help in time of need is the more remarkable, because, when the author of the epistle comes to speak of perfectness through His offering and His appearing in the presence of God for us, he does not speak of Him as priest at all; the reference to His priesthood is wholly dropped.<a name=210:9></a> Though contrasted with the

		But this allusion to the pattern of heavenly things has led the inspired writer to the whole order of the sanctuary, to unfold the worth of Christ's work and sacrifice.<a name=212:1></a> And here let me make a remark not without its importance in the study of the Hebrews.<a name=212:2></a> The mention of the temple is carefully excluded.<a name=212:3></a> That was connected with royalty, with the establishment on earth of what was practically Melchisedec rule and priesthood, the rule of the Son of David.<a name=212:4></a> The tabernacle only is mentioned; this was the pattern of heavenly things.<a name=212:5></a> The temple is never given as such, whatever analogies there may be; the tabernacle is.<a name=212:6></a> Even when he speaks of the system as having still its standing (chapter 9: 8), it is the tabernacle, not the temple.<a name=212:7></a> It is the camp they were to leave, and come outside.<a name=212:8></a> The analogy of Christ's service is distinctly, definitely, and declaredly after the similitude of the Aaronic service in the tabernacle, not after any Melchisedec service.<a name=212:9></a> The pattern is what Moses gave, but it is in heaven, and in heaven only and specifically.<a name=212:10></a> It is a present thing, specifically a present thing, as He is in heaven now; not a future thing as Melchisedec is.<a name=212:11></a> He is entered in, not come out.<a name=212:12></a> (Chapter 9: 12.<a name=212:13></a>) The veil is rent, the way into the holiest is open, and the blood of Christ purges the conscience.<a name=212:14></a> And the apostle speaks to those to whom the epistle is addressed, who are partakers of the heavenly calling, and can say, He is the high priest of our profession.<a name=212:15></a> The heavenly things themselves are in question.<a name=212:16></a> Christ is entered into heaven itself <i>now</i> to appear in the presence of God for <i>us</i>.<a name=212:17></a>

		In this, as we have seen, though compared with what Aaron did, there is no mention of priesthood.<a name=212:18></a> It is another matter.<a name=212:19></a> In chapter 4: 14 we have the analogy strikingly stated: "a great high priest that is passed through [not into] the heavens," as Aaron through the court and holy place into the sanctuary.<a name=212:20></a> But here we have no priest but Christ appearing in the presence of God for us.<a name=212:21></a> He has appeared, not to restore Israel and the world, but to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself.<a name=212:22></a> He has been once offered, not to redeem Israel, but -- in contrast with death and judgment, man's portion as a child of Adam -- to bear the sins (not of Israel, but) of many.<a name=212:23></a> Does this mean that He did not die for the nation, or that the remnant will not be restored on the ground of this sacrifice?<a name=212:24></a> Surely not.<a name=212:25></a> But the passage speaks of other things.<a name=212:26></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		What remains of the Epistle, after such evidence, needs not very enlarged reference.<a name=215:2></a> In chapter 11 I notice one passage -- "God having provided [or foreseen] some better thing for us, that they [Abraham, etc.<a name=215:3></a>] without us should not be made perfect.<a name=215:4></a>" Is it for Christians or for the Jewish remnant that some better thing than Abraham's heavenly portion is provided?<a name=215:5></a> Is not the perfection resurrection glory, not blessing under Melchisedec?<a name=215:6></a>

		All the exhortations in the beginning of chapter 12, if they mean anything, are addressed to Christians.<a name=215:7></a> They were not come to Sinai, but to the full heavenly and earthly blessing, in which the Church of the firstborn and the Old Testament saints are included.<a name=215:8></a> Here alone we have the Church in the Hebrews.<a name=215:9></a> They were come to Jesus.<a name=215:10></a> It will be said, To Jesus, mediator of the new covenant.<a name=215:11></a> Quite true: and I do not doubt that this refers in accomplishment to the millennial earth.<a name=215:12></a> But they were come to Jesus, and this is the essential point; and it is a Jesus not coming back from heaven, but speaking from heaven while He is there.<a name=215:13></a> Chapter 13: 8, 9, clearly shews with whom they were in connection.<a name=215:14></a> The Christ they had been taught to know, by those whose faith they were to follow, was the same yesterday, today, and for ever.<a name=215:15></a> I do not connect the verses as in the English Bible; but it is quite clear that the faith a Christian exhorts to follow is christian faith, and here suggests Christ as the One whose unchangeableness should guard them from strange doctrines: grace, not Jewish meats, was to be their portion.<a name=215:16></a>

		The result of this survey of the Epistle to the Hebrews is, that our being perfected by the offering of Jesus Christ, and His appearing in the presence of God for us, is not referred to priesthood, but that there is a priesthood of intercession available for us because the priest can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; and, having suffered, being tempted, is competent to succour those that are tempted.<a name=216:9></a> That this priesthood is exercised in heaven specifically, in its whole character and nature, and only there, is here brought forward as that which became us; that the comparison and contrast of this priesthood in its exercise is wholly with the ordering and service of the tabernacle.<a name=216:10></a> The priest is according to the order of Melchisedec, but of the exercise of a Melchisedec priesthood there is no mention, hint, or trace.<a name=216:11></a> It is a priesthood exercised in heaven only, into which Christ is entered as Aaron into the holiest made with hands.<a name=216:12></a> It is addressed to Christians formally and expressly in all its parts; if it reach over -- as a groundwork of Israel's future hopes, as what is taught in it surely does -- it has no direct application to them, save as Christ's present position and His accomplished work secure these hopes; and as it does not take proper church ground (that is, our sitting in heavenly places in Christ), it can

	<div class="paragraph">
		I now take up some of the remarks which have given occasion to this paper.<a name=217:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first goes to the root of the whole matter.<a name=217:5></a> I have touched upon it, but it is too important to pass over, namely, that church position is our only position.<a name=217:6></a> That we are never out of the position of those who belong to the Church is quite true, but that is not church position.<a name=217:7></a> Church position is the unity of the body which thus sits in heavenly places in its Head, inseparable from it and so perfect.<a name=217:8></a> Now, this position belongs to all true Christians, but they are not always viewed in this position.<a name=217:9></a> Were it so, all individual relationship with the Father would cease.<a name=217:10></a> Christ would have nothing to do with calling us brethren; could not be the Firstborn among many brethren; has ceased to be the good Shepherd; as, on the other hand, individual responsibility has ceased; we cry no more, Abba, Father.<a name=217:11></a> None of these things have to do with the body, though they belong to those who are in the body.<a name=217:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, further, the Epistle to the Romans, save chapter 12, does not apply to this position, but to individual responsibility, and individual death to sin, and individual position and privilege.<a name=217:13></a> The Colossians, though the doctrine is once referred to, does not set us on this ground.<a name=217:14></a> In that epistle we are dead and risen with Christ, but not sitting in heavenly places, but taught to look up there.<a name=217:15></a> The Philippians never takes this ground at all, yet the whole of it is individual christian experience, of one down here, but, as down here, of the highest practical kind.<a name=217:16></a> Sin is not mentioned.<a name=217:17></a> He did not know whether to desire life or death; decides his case when, thus, self has no place at all, by that which is useful for the Church; never does but one thing, has but one object; and as Christ had always been magnified in him, so he hopes He ever will be.<a name=217:18></a> Yet church position is never thought of.<a name=217:19></a>

		Another <i>very</i> serious mistake which I refer to as a general principle is, that God owns no kind of relationship with God out of Israel on the ground of profession.<a name=218:12></a> The words are these in page 9: "I repeat, Israel and Israel only, ever had any link with God upon the ground of profession without the reality of internal life.<a name=218:13></a>" "It is not now Jew or Gentile, but Christ's or the world's.<a name=218:14></a>" Link is a vague word: real link of course there cannot be.<a name=218:15></a> But if it be meant that men are not dealt with as in a recognized relationship with Christ, it is a very dangerous and mischievous mistake.<a name=218:16></a> The house of God may certainly be built with wood, and hay, and stubble here on the earth.<a name=218:17></a> The apostle warns the Corinthians that Israel were baptized to Moses and partook of the same spiritual meat and drink, referring to baptism and the Lord's Supper, yet fell in the wilderness, and they were to take heed by their example.<a name=218:18></a> In John, we read that he who hates his brother is a murderer and has not eternal life.<a name=218:19></a> The seven churches are all treated by the Lord as on the footing of churches, though judged, and the last spued out of His mouth.<a name=218:20></a> Peter tells us that judgment begins at the house of God.<a name=218:21></a> But more, in Matthew 24 the servant who says, My lord delays his coming, is treated as a servant.<a name=218:22></a> The lord of that servant comes; and he has his portion with hypocrites.<a name=218:23></a> The servant who had one talent is treated as a wicked and slothful servant, and is judged as a servant, cast out as an unprofitable servant.<a name=218:24></a> The scripture is full of relationships, bringing judgments <i>according to those relationships</i>, where no internal life is.<a name=218:25></a> It is the whole history of Christianity in this

	<div class="paragraph">
		Another important principle is, our personal standing before God and the Father as regards Christ's work.<a name=219:3></a> Nothing is thought of in the tract but perfection of standing, and with this is connected the total exclusion of Christ from all loving service for the saint.<a name=219:4></a> His presence in heaven secures us, the Holy Ghost works in us; but Christ has nothing to do for us at all: no care, no love in exercise, no advocacy.<a name=219:5></a> His presence secures us, but He does nothing up there, and the Holy Ghost does all down here.<a name=219:6></a> So that He does nothing anywhere.<a name=219:7></a> This is a serious statement.<a name=219:8></a> Such is the doctrine of page 19 of "Remarks," etc.<a name=219:9></a>, which allows no intercession or advocacy unless to propitiate God.<a name=219:10></a> "The intercession or advocacy needful and consequent upon failure in the walk, as it is put in the tract, must be to propitiate God, because Christ is up there and we down here.<a name=219:11></a> If imputation of sin is impossible (which is true, for Christ is there for us as having put away our sin), it is something in the heart of the saint that is needed: and one down here to do that needed thing.<a name=219:12></a> Now that is just the place and work of the Holy Ghost, and nowhere do we read that <i>it</i> is the work of Christ for us in heaven.<a name=219:13></a> The Holy Ghost tells us -- witnesseth within us -- of the permanent, perfected work of Him who is our 'Guardian' in heaven, and so maintains us there before God in all the virtue of His own person and work, notwithstanding our failure down here; and the practical result of this -- the Spirit's witness to this -- is to lead the soul, not only away from the failure, but back to communion with God.<a name=219:14></a>"

		This position of Christ exalted on high we have in the first two chapters of Hebrews, and though directly applied, as we have seen, to Christians, yet, as never entering on distinct church ground, it can go back to Jewish Christians on the ground they had been upon, to call them out of it as to its connection with Judaism which they had insisted upon, make them recognize in a heavenly Christ the reality of the shadows of the law, which were only patterns of things in the heavens, of which the heavenly things themselves to which they were called were the reality, and look at Christ's position as that which was available for the future blessing of the people through faith.<a name=233:15></a> It is not that blessing,

		God's part of it, in instituting the Lord's Supper); but no new covenant made, only the old ready to vanish away; preparation for blessing fully made, but no blessing there yet; that is, no Melchisedec, but Christ in the heavenly places, according to the pattern of the tabernacle into which Aaron entered.<a name=235:1></a> This is developed in chapter 9.<a name=235:2></a> Christ is come an high priest of good things to come, of the whole blessing reserved for heaven and earth in millennial times, spoken of in chapter 12.<a name=235:3></a> The blood of the covenant is shed; Christ is entered into the heavenly places, into God's presence for us; not yet come out to bless.<a name=235:4></a> But then, no church privileges as such are touched upon, the rapture is not spoken of, and consequently the teaching has such a shape as that, while full blessing for us, and the deliverance of heaven and earth by power, (though not our entrance into the cloud, Luke 9, nor the Father's house, John 14) are before us, yet it is such as the redeemed people when brought in by God can wait for; not confined to them, could not be when the blood was spoken of, but which when called and wrought in by God they will enjoy.<a name=235:5></a> In contrast with judgment, not in the sovereign counsels of privilege, He will appear to them that look for Him without sin to salvation.<a name=235:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The hortatory part of the Epistle affords and can afford no reference to future hopes; it must address itself to those who were in the present circumstances to which the exhortations could apply.<a name=235:7></a> But the motives given afford a remarkable and complete summary of the whole blessing of heaven and earth, to which I have already alluded.<a name=235:8></a> I refer to chapter 12: 22-25.<a name=235:9></a> The first point is only a general principle: Sion in contrast with Sinai; not itself Melchisedec, the Son of David, but grace triumphant by power; not the temple, not the tabernacle (this last was at Shiloh where Solomon went), but, when Ichabod was written on the people under the old covenant, God coming on in grace to deliver -- a principle which applies alike to us and to the remnant, which is the ground those who stand on Mount Sion with the Lamb will stand upon, but which is the principle to which every Christian can say "we are come," as is said here.<a name=235:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nor is this all; it is in fact accompanied here by the full introduction of both parts of the fruits of grace, the heavenly, and the earthly.<a name=235:11></a> All is ours, and blessing secured to the remnant by blood, but nothing in actual possession -- characteristic of the whole epistle and of our position.<a name=235:12></a> After Sion we have, the city of the living God the heavenly Jerusalem, an innumerable

	<div class="paragraph">
		Further, and here we descend to the earth and coming blessing, Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, but no new covenant yet, only the Mediator there; then lastly the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel.<a name=236:8></a> Abel's blood cried from the ground for vengeance, but in Christ, the blood of that better Abel (whom Israel had slain, yea, called His blood, in their unbelief, to rest on their own and their children's heads) called in God's sight in grace for mercy and blessing, and that for the Cain who had rejected and slain Him with wicked hands -- to call them (blessed time!<a name=236:9></a>) from their vagabond estate to the blessings that grace had given them so rich a part in, though on the earth.<a name=236:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus this passage, while it puts all <i>de facto</i> in the present state, looks out -- inasmuch as the Mediator and the blood of the new covenant are there -- beyond present things: the branches reach over the wall; and, while for us what is heavenly will be fulfilled, being come to grace, we can look on to what will belong to Israel when the time is come.<a name=236:11></a> I have only touched on the great principle here, as helpful to clear up the Epistle.<a name=236:12></a> More indeed will be found in the "Synopsis of the Books of the Bible.<a name=236:13></a>" But I am not aware of any connection of the priesthood in exercise with Israel's hopes at all.<a name=236:14></a> The word, and the place Christ is in, do refer to them; and the fact that He is mediator of the new covenant, and that the blood of sprinkling has been shed, does.<a name=236:15></a> The exercise of priesthood is for those who are in relationship.<a name=236:16></a>

		I add two cautions.<a name=236:17></a> The Epistle to the Ephesians tells us what we <i>should</i> always be, our true and holy standard.<a name=236:18></a> Let us surely dwell upon and keep ourselves there.<a name=236:19></a> That to the Hebrews gives us what we <i>need</i>, the comfort called for in the midst of weakness and trial.<a name=236:20></a> Let us thank God that it is there, not as the measure of our relationships with God, but our comfort when we

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Further, we do not go to the priest: he goes to God for us, and we to God.<a name=237:5></a> On this point scripture is clear, however God may bear with weakness.<a name=237:6></a> Priesthood is, in its present exercise, for those who are reconciled.<a name=237:7></a>

		SUPERSTITION IS NOT FAITH; OR, THE TRUE CHARACTER OF ROMANISM
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Superstition is the subjection of the mind of man -- in the things of God -- to that, for subjection to which there is no warrant in divine testimony.<a name=238:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The objects of this superstitious reverence or fear may be (1) such as (being mere creatures) were themselves subject to man's power, or at least to his mind; or (2) they may be the creatures of his own imagination; or (3) such as exercise a real and evil malignant influence over him, as Satan and the evil demons; or (4) they may be creatures good and excellent in themselves, and even such as are in a position superior to man, and instruments of divine power or testimony.<a name=238:2></a> But for subjection to these, or for any kind of worship rendered to them, or for employing them in religious service on our behalf, there is no warrant in divine testimony.<a name=238:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Of the first class of superstitious reverence, the worship of animals -- as among the Egyptians -- or of the sun, moon, and stars -- one of the earliest forms of idolatry -- are examples.<a name=238:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Of the second, a vast mass of the religion of the Greeks is an example -- as fauns, satyrs, Pan, etc.<a name=238:5></a>; whence even it is called mythology, or the doctrine of myths or fables.<a name=238:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Of the third class is serpent-worship, and the worship of the powers of evil, found in many countries of Africa; and, in a general way, the whole of heathen idolatry, as the apostle testifies (1 Corinthians 10: 20), alluding to Deuteronomy 32: 17, "The things which the Gentiles offer, they offer to devils or demons, and not to God.<a name=238:7></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the last class we have that of which the apostle speaks in Colossians 2: "a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels.<a name=238:8></a>" So the apostle John was himself tempted to fall down and worship before the feet of the angel, who had been God's servant in the communication of the apocalyptic visions: the angel replying, "See thou do it not, for I am thy fellow servant.<a name=238:9></a>" Also setting the saints above in heaven, in the place of mediation, in which God has not set them; or even men on the earth, in virtue of their office, as if they were priests (that is, really, mediators, having another kind of prevailing power with God than other men).<a name=238:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=239>[Page 239]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All these, though differing in character, have this in common: -- they are the subjection of the mind of man, in the things of God, to that for subjection to which there is no warrant from divine testimony.<a name=239:1></a> This is <i>superstition.<a name=239:2></a> Faith</i>, on the contrary, is the reception of a divine testimony into the soul, so that God Himself is believed.<a name=239:3></a><a href="#239:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The consequence of either of these (consequences as opposite as the nature of that from which they respectively flow) is sufficiently evident.<a name=239:4></a> The object of our superstitious reverence gets between our souls and God, and in practice supplants Him, and takes His place.<a name=239:5></a> God is, indeed, never entirely forgotten.<a name=239:6></a> Even among the idolatrous heathen there was a vague idea of one supreme God, shewn, as Tertullian has remarked, by their habitual exclamations; and some of the philosophers insisted and enlarged on this, though without any true knowledge of Him.<a name=239:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Still, the whole practical condition of men depended on the character of the superstition with which their hearts were immediately in connection.<a name=239:8></a> The Athenians might rear an altar to the unknown God, but they did not rise morally by this ignorance.<a name=239:9></a> Their state was what the state of those must have been who worshipped a Jupiter, a Minerva, and a Venus, or who were in daily association with their altars.<a name=239:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The introduction of the one true God may be in a greater or lesser degree; but it remains true, that in general, where any object intervenes between us and God, He is so far hidden; and the effect upon men is, that they are lowered to the standard of what they reverence.<a name=239:11></a> God's presence (whatever their fears) does not act immediately upon their consciences as <i>light</i>, or elevate their hearts to Himself as <i>love</i>.<a name=239:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, though this power over the imagination of things which divine testimony does not authorize our reverence of is often called faith (though it be merely connecting the religious element of man's nature with what is not God, and is no real revelation of God), it is really the opposite of faith.<a name=239:13></a> Faith brings <i>God</i> present to the soul.<a name=239:14></a> Faith is, as we have seen, the reception into the soul of a divine testimony.<a name=239:15></a> Now, the grand object of this, especially in Christianity, is the revelation of God Himself.<a name=239:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#239:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>In speaking of religious subjects, I have not thought it necessary to speak of the belief of mere human testimony. No one, of course, denies that there is such a thing as the belief of human testimony. The only thing important to remark here is, that really to believe the testimony of a person, I must receive what he says because he has said it; if I require something to confirm it, I so far discredit his testimony.
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=240>[Page 240]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In every case a divine testimony carries direct divine authority, and is, so far, a revelation of God.<a name=240:1></a> The consequence is, faith brings the soul into God's own presence; and hence everything is judged in the light itself, for God is light.<a name=240:2></a> All a man's works, all that is in man, is brought into the light, the man's conscience having His perfect light for a measure by which to judge himself.<a name=240:3></a> But as God has in Christ revealed Himself in love, faith, which embraces His revelation, produces a sweet and blessed confidence in God Himself, known as love; as a Saviour who has given His own Son, who has by Himself purged our sins.<a name=240:4></a> Thus, while all is judged by the believer's conscience in the light of God's own presence, it is all put away according to the demand of that holiness; and we are at peace with God, and can walk with Him in newness of life.<a name=240:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So that faith puts into <i>immediate</i> connection with God; a connection founded on His own testimony, which is received by the operation of divine power in the soul; and hence also has its practical existence in real confidence of God Himself.<a name=240:6></a> The soul is reconciled with Him; and God becomes, by the revelation of Himself in the testimony He has given, the moral measure of right and wrong to the soul which is elevated to connection with Himself through Jesus.<a name=240:7></a> Hence it is exactly opposite to superstition, though this latter assumes its name and forms, and may be connected, as it ever is, more or less, with the idea of the true God.<a name=240:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This last circumstance leads us to another important remark: that, while superstition hides the true God, and wholly falsifies our notions of Him, this connection in the mind of the superstitious object of reverence with the idea of the true God attaches the authority of His name and supreme power to the object of our superstition, and sanctions, by that authority, all the moral degradation involved in our connection with it; save in so far as natural conscience revolts, and tells a truer tale of God than the superstition.<a name=240:9></a> But then alas!<a name=240:10></a> the tendency of this last is to exalt man above what he has made religion, and to produce infidelity and even atheism, if atheism were possible to man's mind, which I do not believe.<a name=240:11></a> But it tends at least to make men reason as atheists against the superstition which revolts their conscience, and which they know is contrary to what even conscience would know of God.<a name=240:12></a> Human will is always atheistical, for it is not subject to God's will, and will seek to reason against the existence of what it does not like; but God has a testimony in conscience,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		which, after all, the will can never get over.<a name=241:1></a> Where men have reduced what bears the name of God below the standard of natural conscience and feeling, the mind will use this, if it dare, to throw off the authority of the God it dislikes.<a name=241:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		An objection may present itself before going farther -- that what I say of immediate association with God by the reception of divine testimony sets aside ministry.<a name=241:3></a> I answer, Not in the least.<a name=241:4></a> Ministry of the word is a divine ordinance, for the purpose of bringing the testimony of God to the soul of man; and, if in real divine power, the effect is to bring, by the living word, God Himself in Christ present to the soul, so as to place it in the light and bring it to have immediately to say to God.<a name=241:5></a> Priesthood places itself between the soul and God; real ministry brings God, by the word, present to the soul.<a name=241:6></a> This is the essential difference between the true character of each.<a name=241:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is evident that faith must be founded on the testimony of God, otherwise it is not God who is believed.<a name=241:8></a> Further, it must be founded on His testimony alone.<a name=241:9></a> I must believe, because God Himself has spoken, or I do not believe God.<a name=241:10></a> "Whoso," says John Baptist, of the blessed Lord, "he that received his testimony hath set to his seal that <i>God is true.<a name=241:11></a>" So</i> "Abraham <i>believed God</i>, and it was counted to him for righteousness.<a name=241:12></a>" God graciously added in the former case miracles to confirm the word, as it is written, "Confirming the word by signs following.<a name=241:13></a>" But faith was in the testimony of God.<a name=241:14></a> Indeed, if only founded on the miracles, it was without value.<a name=241:15></a> "Many believed in him when they saw the miracles which he did; but Jesus did not commit himself to them, for he knew what was in man.<a name=241:16></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such then, practically, is faith.<a name=241:17></a> It is the soul's reception, by divine power, of the testimony of God; who is thus known by it, as He has revealed Himself, and in whose presence consequently it walks, God having graciously revealed Himself as a Saviour, so that it is in peace in the presence of the Holy One, and in communion with Him.<a name=241:18></a> I do not enter here into the way in which He has revealed Himself, blessed as this subject is above all, because it is not my subject now -- the knowledge of, and communication with, the Father, through the Son, by the grace of the Holy Spirit, as the portion of a soul which has found peace through the blood of the cross.<a name=241:19></a> Such is the Christian's portion; but I turn to a now needed and less happy subject.<a name=241:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not farther pursue the subject of superstition or attack the forms in which it more particularly shews itself; but I shall

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		shew that the Romanist system is not founded on faith, but the contrary.<a name=242:1></a> I have introduced what I have said of superstition to shew that things may be received as true, connected with the worship of God, or our religious habits, which are the opposite of faith; and, as far as they go, destructive of it.<a name=242:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A person may be sincere in his convictions, may fancy God has taught them to others; but if he does not believe them himself on God's testimony, it is not faith; it is not believing God.<a name=242:3></a> Now I shall shew, in the following brief remarks, that Romanism is <i>really</i>, in its main doctrines and practices, infidel (not avowedly perhaps, but really) in all that concerns the ground of our soul's fellowship with God.<a name=242:4></a> I pray my reader's quiet and attentive consideration of my remarks, before he rejects this judgment of it.<a name=242:5></a> Christianity is the revelation, not merely of God's law or God's will, but of God Himself; and God is love.<a name=242:6></a> Hence, we find in it the perfect revelation of His love in the gift of His blessed Son; so that the believing soul, however poor and guilty, should know God as such, and as such toward itself (sin being perfectly and for ever put away for the believer, that he may approach God without fear; for such fear has torment, and love would take away torment for what it loves).<a name=242:7></a> Yet God cannot bear sin in His presence, nor indeed can the renewed and repentant soul bear it either; hence the God of love has put it away through Christ, in order to admit us to His presence.<a name=242:8></a> Thus God has reconciled us to Himself, to enjoy His perfect and gracious love; the same love supplying all the grace needed for us to maintain our fellowship with God in our weakness here, so that even this weakness itself should become the means of our mercifully knowing all His goodness, and the interest He shews in blessing us.<a name=242:9></a> Hence the apostle John thus speaks of the Christian, "We have known and believed the love that God hath to us.<a name=242:10></a>" Christian faith, then, believes in this love.<a name=242:11></a> And everything that is put in between us and God, who exercises it immediately towards us; or tends to shew that it is not so free and perfect; or to militate against that entire, perfect putting away of sin by the blessed Saviour, which makes God's perfect love consistent with His absolute holiness: all such inventions are denials so far of the revelation of Christianity -- of what God really is towards us.<a name=242:12></a> They are so far infidelity.<a name=242:13></a> There is one between us sinners and God; that is, Christ.<a name=242:14></a> But He is the revelation of this love; and the Accomplisher of that which, by putting away sin, would enable us to enjoy it; and the Intercessor through

		Between the Romanist and the Christian who believes that the system which the Romanist maintains is not the truth of God but a vast system of apostate error, two questions are at issue.<a name=243:4></a> One of these questions is, Are the doctrines which the Romanist system teaches true?<a name=243:5></a> The other is, What is the authority in which man can confide in order to know that he possesses the truth?<a name=243:6></a> In both, the Romanist system is really <i>infidel</i>.<a name=243:7></a> I say the system, because I do not deny that some poor ignorant soul may believe in spite of the system, though its faith be all but overwhelmed by its errors.<a name=243:8></a> A man's constitution may, through mercy, resist poison; but this does not say that the drug, from whose effect he has escaped with that constitution ruined, is not poison.<a name=243:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If the scriptures be taken, as having the authority of God's word, as being inspired by Him, as every true Christian acknowledges, the Romanist system of doctrine cannot be maintained for a moment; but my object now is to notice not the errors only, but the <i>infidelity</i> found in it.<a name=243:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I proceed to the proofs of this.<a name=243:11></a> The scriptures teach that, Christ having by one offering perfected for ever them that are sanctified, there is now no more offering for sin.<a name=243:12></a> (Hebrews 10: 14.<a name=243:13></a>) The whole Romanist system is based on, and identical with, the doctrine that there is in the Mass an offering for the sins of the living and the dead.<a name=243:14></a> The scripture teaches us that the only ground on which we can stand in the presence of God is that the blood of Jesus cleanses from all sin.<a name=243:15></a> The Romanist believes that there is a purgatory needed to complete this cleansing, unless for some rare soul in an unusual state of sanctity.<a name=243:16></a> Now these two Romanist doctrines are really infidel as to what God has taught for our peace.<a name=243:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God has said that Christ's offering of Himself was a work so perfect and so efficacious, that it needed not to be repeated, and indeed that it could not be repeated, because, in order to such efficacy, Christ must <i>suffer</i>.<a name=243:18></a> He has declared that without shedding of blood there is no remission, and hence, that if the offering of Christ had to be repeated, Christ must needs have suffered often; but that the efficacy of His one offering of Himself was
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=244>[Page 244]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		such, that it needed not to be repeated.<a name=244:1></a> Now, if I pretend to offer this sacrifice again, and declare that such offering is necessary and right, I deny the efficacy of Christ's one offering of Himself on the cross; that is, I am infidel or unbelieving as to the efficacy of the one offering accomplished by Christ on the cross once for all.<a name=244:2></a> And this is the more clear and decisive, because the apostle, in the passage of the Epistle to the Hebrews to which I refer, is contrasting the repetition of the Jewish sacrifices, because of their inefficacy to make the conscience perfect, with Christ being offered once -- and once for all -- because His sacrifice made perfect for ever those that were sanctified.<a name=244:3></a> (See Hebrews 10: 11-18.<a name=244:4></a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And further, in accepting the Romanist doctrine as to the sacrifice of the mass, I am infidel as regards the authority of God's word, which declares that there is consequently no more offering for sin.<a name=244:5></a> For the Romanist pretends that there is still an offering for sin; for he pretends to have one in the sacrifice of the mass.<a name=244:6></a> That is, he is an infidel as to that which is the foundation of Christianity, namely, the offering of Christ on the cross.<a name=244:7></a> I am well aware that he teaches that the mass is an unbloody sacrifice.<a name=244:8></a> But this excuse is of no avail, for the declaration of scripture is, that there is <i>no more</i> offering for sin.<a name=244:9></a> Yea, it is not only of no avail, but it makes the matter worse; for the Romanist doctrine declares that this unbloody sacrifice is efficacious for the remission of sins; and the scripture declares that without shedding of blood there is no remission (Hebrews 9: 22); so that the Romanist doctrine contradicts scripture expressly.<a name=244:10></a> And note, that this doctrine of an unbloody sacrifice is infidel as to the nature of sin.<a name=244:11></a> God declares the nature of sin to be such, that nothing less than the sufferings of Christ could expiate it; they pretend that an unbloody sacrifice, in which Christ does not suffer can put it away.<a name=244:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, the word of God teaches that "the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth from all sin.<a name=244:13></a>" Blessed truth!<a name=244:14></a> just what our conscience needs, in order to have boldness to go before God, and enter into His presence, as knowing Him to be a gracious and loving Father.<a name=244:15></a> Now the doctrine of purgatory teaches me that the blood of Jesus does not thus purge me; that I must go and suffer in some fire, of which they themselves can give very little account, in order to be purged before I can appear in God's presence; and remark here, this purging fire is for the faithful, for those who have profited by all that which what they call the church has at its disposal for the good of souls.<a name=244:16></a> A good catholic,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is the more strange, because their authentic doctrine declares that extreme unction wipes away the remains of sin, "<i>abstergit peccati reliquias</i>.<a name=245:2></a>" It is strange that, after absolution, and the viaticum, and extreme unction, each of which is alleged to be efficacious to clear a man from sin, he should go into the torment of purgatory after all.<a name=245:3></a> Is this all the efficacy which belongs to the church's acts -- that, after she has done all she can in order to their being cleansed, she lets the souls go into a place of fire, whose efficacy does not flow from her at all?<a name=245:4></a> And remark here, that she then offers the mass to get the soul out of the purgatory which God, they say, has sent it into, out of which she was not able to keep it by all she did for it when in the body!<a name=245:5></a> Are these the Lord's ways, or like the Lord's power?<a name=245:6></a> But this only in passing.<a name=245:7></a> I can understand that a conscience troubled by sin and fearing wrath, will fly to anything to get relief, where the true efficacy of Christ's precious blood to cleanse it and give it peace, is not known.<a name=245:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But why all these efforts and means to relieve and quiet the uneasy soul, why the doctrine of purgatorial fire to cleanse and fit the soul for God's presence?<a name=245:9></a> Because the great and precious truth, that the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses from all sin, is not believed.<a name=245:10></a> If it does so, why go to purgatory (that is, a place of cleansing, for such is the meaning of the word) to get it cleansed?<a name=245:11></a> That is, the Romish system is infidelity as to this great and precious truth also of God's word.<a name=245:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is infidelity too in it, as to something more than the truth; there is infidelity as to God's love.<a name=245:13></a> What is the text constantly quoted to lay a ground for purgatory?<a name=245:14></a> -- "Agree with thine adversary quickly, whilst thou art in the way with him, lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison; verily I say unto thee, thou shalt not come out thence till thou hast paid the last farthing.<a name=245:15></a>" Is it thus God has met us in the gospel?<a name=245:16></a> That the unrepenting sinner will meet with the just wrath due to his sins every true Christian owns; but such a use of this text is really denying the efficacy of Christ's work.<a name=245:17></a> "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.<a name=245:18></a>"

		And that we might be forgiven, Christ has died upon the cross.<a name=246:1></a> But this doctrine of purgatory teaches that we must pay to the very last farthing -- that God will exact it of us.<a name=246:2></a> It is infidelity as to that grace which has given Jesus to <i>bear our sins</i> in His own body on the tree; so that every repentant sinner should know that God loved him, so as not to spare His own Son, but gave Him as a propitiation for his sins; and that Christ has, by the sacrifice of Himself, put away the sin that justly alarmed his conscience; or, as the scripture expresses it, "He has by HIMSELF purged our sins.<a name=246:3></a>" (Hebrews 1: 3.<a name=246:4></a>) The doctrine of purgatory is really infidelity as to the efficacy of Christ's blood; for, if this has cleansed the true Christian from all sin, he does not want purgatory to effect his cleansing.<a name=246:5></a> It is infidelity as to the authority of God's word, which declares that His blood does cleanse us from all sin, and that Christ, when He had by Himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high; and it is infidelity as to the precious love of God, who gave His Son to do it, that we might have peace in our souls through His name.<a name=246:6></a>

		The church -- that is, certain men (supposing even they were inspired) -- have told me certain things, and I am bound to believe them; Peter, Paul, John, Matthew, and others, that is, the apostles and other writers of the New Testament, have told me certain things as inspired men, and I cannot tell whether I am to believe them or not!<a name=250:6></a> If so, then these apostles have not the same claim over my conscience and faith as the former.<a name=250:7></a> It is in vain to tell me the former compose the church, and that it has God's authority: had not the inspired apostles God's authority?<a name=250:8></a> Did not what they say bind the saints' conscience?<a name=250:9></a> It is not a question of interpreting.<a name=250:10></a> The question is, Has what they say authority over my conscience, so that I am bound to receive it as God's word and believe it?<a name=250:11></a> St.<a name=250:12></a> Paul writes an epistle to the church -- say at Corinth: -- were they bound to receive it as God's word?<a name=250:13></a> If so, am I?<a name=250:14></a> If I am not, they were not; and note, they were the church; that is, the church has to receive the work of the apostle, not to pronounce on it.<a name=250:15></a> Woe be to them if they did not; woe be to me if I do not.<a name=250:16></a>

		I am satisfied that the great business of the Christian, the great utility of such a work as "The Present Testimony," is to bring before the saints, and the world, if they will read it, the great principles of Christianity, and more particularly when they have been buried under the rubbish of man's mind, plentifully heaped up in the early ages, and built up by schoolmen in the middle ages by Aristotle's help; and to bring forth from the revelations of the word the unsearchable riches of Christ, and the thoughts and ways of God.<a name=254:1></a> This is the true preservative against the errors and seductions of the time; and indeed nothing else will preserve from them.<a name=254:2></a> Still I suppose it may not be wholly useless, though an inferior part of christian service, to point out anything peculiar in the forms of evil, the notice of which may help to clear the minds of God's children from them; or to bring before the watchful eye of the saint the bearing of facts and events in the current of evil which Providence allows to go on, or of which, in order to bring about blessing, it may hasten the development upon earth.<a name=254:3></a>

It is not our purpose to speak of the acts of healing which were thus wrought, because His divine mind and will must not be excluded from participation in the miracles of which His body was the medium. Yet when we consider the nature of His body in itself, when we inquire whether the conditions of its existence answer to the character of Him who assumed it, we see peculiar reasons why virtue should flow, as we are assured it did, out of His body into the bodies of others." No doubt: but was this the eternal life of the soul? "Now since Christ as the second Adam is that seed of life, through whom the spiritual body is to be quickened at the last day, that virtue should go out of Him when He was upon earth is nowise inconsistent with what scripture leads us to expect." "Whether the influence exerted when He were [was] upon earth were material or immaterial, it is needless to ask." ... "He [our Lord] set it [His, man's body] forth as possessed of an instrumental efficacy in that work of renovating the race of man, which extends to the restoration of their bodies, as well as the renewal of their souls." If that is not convenient logic, surely I know not what is. But the looseness of the author's reasoning -- the utter inconclusiveness of his statements -- is beyond all I ever read. The soul is slipped in here without the smallest ray of connection with the argument, as if touching the body renewed that. Yet this is the whole point as to spiritual benefit by sacraments as an extension of the incarnation. But you may have Cyril, his great authority, to vouch for it, soul and all: "since the life-giving Word of God dwelt in the flesh, He transformed it into that excellence which belongs to Himself, that is, into life, and by His intimate and unspeakable union with it, He rendered it life-giving, as He is -- Himself." *Cyril. Alex*. 4, 354; who, however, declares it equally true of the wicked, so that little serves our author's object or indeed his own.

	</div>
	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#278:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>Not only does our author urge its being only partial, but his views are somewhat those of Quakers. He holds that "the life was the light of men" applies to what Christ was as the word. The law of conscience is one "which has its origin in God's image reflected in the creature's mind. St. Paul speaks of it as the work of the law written in men's hearts." He slurs over here the fact that it is not the law which is written at all. "And St. John tells us, that it was not a law the perpetual maintenance whereof had been entrusted only to human powers: it was preserved by the abiding influence of that all-pervading Word, who never totally forsook the beings whom He had created ... . 'In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.' The second result of this partial perpetuation of his Maker's image was the preservation of a measure of that intercourse with God, which in the first instance had doubtless been full and unrestricted ... . What was secret prayer, as a rite of heathen religion, but the intuitional reaching forth of the mind after its invisible Creator? ... This intercourse is built upon that all-pervading action of the eternal Word, which was the original light of our being ... . This, then, is the old road of nature; this the channel through which light was originally transmitted from God to man. Now, the law of mediation is the substitution of a new channel of intercourse instead of this old one. The law of grace is given in place of the law of nature. The old door of access had been shut or obstructed by sin; therefore, in the manhood of Christ was a new door opened to mankind." Now it is not that there was not a conscience in every man, "a certain inherent judgment respecting right and wrong." Surely there was. Man ACQUIRED IT IN THE FALL, by which he was *separated from God*. Nor do I say that God left Himself without witness, if haply men might feel after Him and find Him. We know He did not; so that men were without excuse. But this is not the statement of the Archdeacon. With him this is a nature which was the power of holding intercourse with God: that in man which was preserved by the abiding influence of the all-pervading Word. "The guiding light, then, of original humanity was ... a special and supernatural in-dwelling of the great Author of all knowledge ... . For even the heathen must have derived their remaining light of conscience, however darkened and confused, from Him who is the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world;" that is, it is His influence within and not His witness without to a conscience acquired in the fall, which, after all, drove him from God (Genesis 3: 8-10), and a heart which, alas! was enmity against Him. <p>Christ removes the obstruction to this preserved image being in intercourse with God, and gives fuller objects. It is not death come on the first Adam and utter condemnation, and in us, that is in our flesh, no good thing, and Christ, a sacrifice to put away sin, and, as second Adam, an entirely new life in which, in the power which is in Him, we live to God. It is a renewal of the old intercourse, improving it perhaps, but Christ adopting our humanity in its disordered state and reconstructing it in His own person as alive here, and then, according to infinite wisdom passing through sufferings and glorified so as to communicate it there. "Our ancient intercourse with God has been given back only through that new Founder of man's race, through whom alone we can approach the Father." And again, "This He did, not by the creation of materials which did not before exist; the materials were drawn from that stock for which the benefit was designed. 'He was made of a woman.' (It is merely *genomenon ek gunaikos, genomenon upo nomou*.) The materials, therefore, which were employed, were weak and disorganised, because they were taken out of one who naturally was heir to Adam's defects. But then He who took them was the Word of God. Into these weak and poor elements of our nature there flowed the very might, wisdom, and purity of Deity itself. Thus was their weakness from the first corrected; from the first moment that His nature existed its disorder was counteracted by the perfect order and harmony of God's Spirit, and though made of a woman, He was made without sin." <p>I do not expatiate on the excessive looseness of the Archdeacon's statement (and he is the most inaccurate, loosest writer, with the pretensions he has to philosophical theology, that one might easily find: take the statement, for example, that the disorder of His nature was counteracted by the perfect order and harmony of God's Spirit, which may be said of us, but certainly not of Christ) -- I do not expatiate on it, because I hope and suppose he means no harm; or on the doctrine, which is really, as it stands, practically Apollinarianism, because I believe he does not mean it, but is merely loose in his statements, from extreme inaccuracy and carelessness in mind and habits of thought, associated with exceeding boldness and even irreverence as to the subjects he treats. <p>But what miserable materialism there is in all this! They were materials whose disorder He corrected. But I especially refer to the passage here in connection with regeneration. It was a divine person taking the old materials and counteracting their disorder. Is that all? The might, wisdom, and purity of Deity itself, flowing into the weak and poor elements of our nature? I repeat, it is Apollinarianism really, but is there no really new life which Adam had not? Is it merely Deity correcting, or, as the Archdeacon heretically expresses it, counteracting the disorder of fallen Adam's elements? Let the reader note this. The doctrine is elaborately wrought out in the system; it is sacramental materialism, a correction by a kind of divine physical process. The very words I use offend me; but what can I do, when men speak of materials and of taking the same composition of parts? I do not doubt He did, so as to be as really man as we are; but is this eternal life in Christ? Is this what Christ is as a new life to those united to Him by grace? Life is in Him and He is our life. Is this merely a counteraction of disorder in the weak and poor elements of our nature? <p>But I must close this note: only I recall here the Archdeacon's account of the first and second Adam, that we may see the utter and fundamental unsoundness of the whole system as to what Christ's person is -- what sin is -- what the fall is -- and what our recovery is. "One circumstance, which must of course greatly affect the whole question, is the perfect parallel which exists between the first man and the Second -- between the type and the Antitype -- him in whom humanity fell, and Him in whom it rose again -- between Adam in whom a divine Spirit was united only for a season to our mortal being, and Christ, in whom the *same Spirit* dwelt permanently and without measure." Again, "For in His [Christ's] constitution there were the elements of Adam's being, together with the perfect presence of that wisdom of God, which had vouchsafed its influence as an indwelling gift to our first parent." And, as regards the pattern-man and the exclusion of resurrection -- "In Adam was humanity, and the presence of the Word superadded as a guiding light. In Christ was God the Word by personal presence, who for our sakes had added to Himself human flesh. Thus it attained that perfection of man's nature, which, in the case of our first parent, was only transiently set forth. For that perfection lay in the intercourse with God, which Adam so soon renounced. But in Christ is this intercourse restored permanently and in its completeness." Is this a just account of incarnation, to say nothing of resurrection?

But the use of such arguments to prove man not wholly lost, and that some good remains, in spite of the apostle's assertion, "I know that in me, that is in my flesh, dwells no good thing," is absurd; because, as to the knowledge of right and wrong *in se*, it was acquired by the fall, and was no part of man's unfallen nature, and proves no inclination to good whatever, but is a conscience which the inclination to evil constantly violates -- "video *meliora proboque, deteriora sequor*;" secondly, because, as to mere amiable qualities, they are found in the brute, parental fondness, devotedness to a benefactor, even to the laying down life rather than allow injury to a beloved master, patient endurance of even injustice from him, and of everything for him, and every other natural quality which can adorn human nature as a nature, but which prove nothing as to his moral condition in relationship to God.

		<a class="footnote" name="#286:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>"And by reason hereof there was conferred as a gift upon the man Jesus Christ, that quickening power which pertained to His Godhead by nature. For as the Father hath life in Himself, so hath He given to the Son to have life in Himself. And so did He declare when addressing the Father as Mediator for His brethren, 'Thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him." I add another passage to one already quoted, to shew that Christ *is* presented as the source of life as incarnate. "Thus was there bestowed upon what was human in Him such living energy, as was evidenced while He was upon earth, when there went virtue out of Him and healed them all. So that it became that 'quickening spirit,' which *is* able to bestow a new life on the progeny of Adam, and that bread of life which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof and not die." Remark how he leaves out the giving of it to which I have referred. The Archdeacon adds, moreover, in a subsequent passage -- "It was because Christ, therefore, was the Head and Father of man's race, that He bore, in like manner, not part, but all its punishment." <p>St. Cyril, from whom the substance of his doctrine is drawn, is more consistent. The Archdeacon will declare as to Christ's mediation, "that its proper reference is in those who are united to Him." Cyril, after stating as an objection to our being raised because united to Christ that all are raised, adds, "for all shall rise again according to the similitude of Him who has been raised for our sakes, and has all in Himself," *pantas echontas en eauto.* Only, he says, it will be for judgment. This is founded on the following statement: -- "Christ, therefore, gave for the life of men His own body, and causes again life to dwell in us; and I will say now as well as I can, for since the life-giving Word of God dwelt in flesh, He transformed it *(meteskeuasen)* into His own good, that is, into life, and, being joined to it in an ineffable way of union, made it life-giving, according to what He is Himself by nature. Therefore the body of Christ vivifies those who partake of it." The objection is then made, that unbelievers will rise. The undaunted theologian then adds, "Through the resurrection of Christ, the mystery extends (diekein) to all humanity, that is, all men, for all rise, being contained in Him, so that all are raised in virtue of union with Christ being contained in Him. His incarnation has made Him the Head of the race." It will be remarked, that He is said to have borne the punishment of all as such. For what they are to be in the resurrection of judgment, I must leave to others to explain. Cyril equally applies his death, *as bearing their sins*, to all, saying, dikas uphezon, and then quoting 1 Peter 2: 24.

		Besides, then, its connection with the fundamental doctrine of the necessity of redemption and our total ruin by sin, the truth that death must come in, in order to our union with Christ, is clearly established by the characteristic ordinances of the christian religion; and it is shewn, that it is not by a rectifying of the old man, in connection with the filling of humanity with divine power and grace by the incarnation when Jesus was in the likeness of sinful flesh, by which we are regenerate in union with the Lord Christ; but by the establishment of a new man, of which the pattern in power of life is in Christ risen and glorified, to whose image we are to be conformed, and that consequent not only on His living in the likeness of sinful flesh (though sinless) but in His being (a sacrifice) for sin, so that by His death sin in the flesh has been condemned (Romans 8: 4); and the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus, thus risen from the dead, has made us free from the law of sin and death.<a name=288:12></a> Hence, having Christ for our life, we reckon ourselves dead and do this one thing, press towards the mark of our calling on high.<a name=288:13></a> The effect is the walk of a heavenly man, such as Christ was on earth, because we are in Him who is in heaven.<a name=288:14></a> It is when He was raised from the dead

	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#312:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>The way high-churchmen avoid and slip over the great facts of church history is very peculiar. Jerome's statement as to the episcopacy being a human arrangement for quiet is conveniently ignored, and here in a note our essayist tells us, "We do not intend to enter into the question as to how far the individual members of these communities receive grace ... . For this reason we purposely avoid hazarding conjecture on the efficacy of schismatical and lay baptism." (Page 189*.)* But if people "have cut themselves off from the participation of the one Spirit as living in the church and flowing through the sacraments which are the arteries and veins of the body," what is the effect of the schismatical and lay baptizing? Yet by baptism alone life and the special gift of the Spirit is given, they tell us. They have not the gift which brings them into union. But it is very natural they should shirk it and leave it as a vague dread because the question was raised in the early church. The famous Cyprian in Africa, and Firmilian in Asia Minor, and by their influence Africa, and at any rate a large part of the East, denounced Pope Stephen, because he did not rebaptize heretics; inasmuch as, not being in the church where the Holy Ghost was, they could give nothing, and they remained firm and refused to give way. However mighty as the consent of the fathers, if to be found, may be, the contrary doctrine prevailed, and lay baptism is commonly practised in the Latin church (that is now the right word), and heretical baptism held to be valid -- for the absence of the truth and the Spirit is immaterial where the form is; I suppose I should add the matter also in the case of a sacrament. It is really ludicrous to see the torture in which the truly excellent Augustine in his controversy with the Donatists is through the prevalence of this doctrine. It was held as by our essayist -- which is a most fatal error -- that the Spirit was given in baptism. Yet the Donatists had not the Spirit, he alleged, because this was only in the Catholic church. Yet, said the Donatist, you declare we have given and received it in baptism, and you condemn the contrary doctrine. Poor Augustine fumes, taken in the toils of his adversary. <p>Do you understand, reader, why our essayist avoids the question? Schismatical and lay baptism confers the Spirit, and the new life -- I suppose, according to them, therefore union with Christ -- but they have not the Spirit and cannot have union but by the church; for the catholic idea is, that union and communion with the church are absolutely necessary to union and communion with Christ; and that persons are received into communion with the church in order to union with Christ, and further, that this communion is effected by a communication of a spiritual gift, an actual bestowal of the grace of God to the person through this ministration of the church's ordinances. And such a union is -- by the means of the gifts of God in Christ's own appointed way -- holy baptism. So they come into the church in order to come into union with Christ; "that sacrament is the means of conferring on the recipient a new and spiritual life" and communication of a spiritual gift, and of the grace of God; and yet schismatics and laymen who cannot minister these holy mysteries confer all these things outside the church, and, instead of coming into the communion of the church to get union with Christ, they receive it all out of the communion of the church, and receive union with Christ without communion with the church at all. I must leave it to Anglicans to say if they are brought thus into the communion of the church by having union with Christ outside it. That they have the latter is, at any rate, the orthodox doctrine. No wonder they purposely avoided hazarding conjecture; but I can hardly suppose such learned men to be ignorant of the Donatist controversy or of the discussion of the question between Cyprian and Stephen and Firmilian, or of the every-day fact of lay baptism in the Roman system, or of the decision of the Arches Court (to come nearer home), that a child baptized by dissenters had consequently a right to burial in consecrated ground.

		The doctrine therefore of the body of Christ, a body to be perfected in glory, and also that of a body existing on earth -- of a house to become a perfect and holy temple in the Lord, and that of a present habitation of God through the Spirit, that which Christ builds infallibly and perfectly for the final result, and that in which, as a present thing, man is responsible by the way -- are all clearly taught in scripture.<a name=318:11></a> One the Evangelicals and Dissenters admit, though obscurely, what Christ is building for final glory; but the body now formed on earth, by the Spirit, and the house now the habitation of the Spirit, they have wholly lost sight of; and of these scripture speaks.<a name=318:12></a>

It is with a broken body and shed blood we have to do, that which, as I have said in the text, does not exist now; and the drinking of the cup as a distinct thing is essential to the nature and meaning of the sacrament. It declares, too, that death has come in, and necessarily, that there can be no participation in the blessing of incarnation, without the death of Christ also. "Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink of his blood, ye have no life in you." Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abides alone! The bread which He gives is His flesh, which He gives for the life of the world, which He gives in the shedding of His blood; and this must be drunk as a separate thing.

		<a class="footnote" name="#327:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>I do not enter on the question of infant baptism here (which, for my own part, from other scriptures, I hold to be right), but discuss the place baptism holds. The Anglican church teaches, in the most express way possible, that faith is necessary to baptism: only it is faith in the promise of God made to them in that sacrament. Infants, they say, promise this by their sureties; but I suppose, if they believe the promises made there, they must believe in Him who made them, and in whose name they are baptized; they must believe, or others for them, that Jesus is the Son of God. That is, according to this system, faith goes before baptism. It is not my business to reconcile this with the doctrine of being born by baptism, for we are the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. What is required of those of riper years is to be examined whether they be sufficiently instructed in the principles of the christian religion, and they are to prepare themselves with prayer and fasting. I suppose they are really to believe these principles, they are to have faith for it -- must, unless they are hypocrites. Indeed without faith it is impossible to please God. It would be curious research, but too tedious, to examine the utter confusion in which the Anglican catholic is by his blunders as to baptism and false ideas of its place. Men are born of God in it, yet have faith in order to receive it. Indeed under the form of the Apostles creed, the person to be baptized is called upon to profess his faith in all Christian doctrine, in Christ Himself. He is to be baptized in this faith. That is his desire, I suppose accounted genuine and sincere. Now it is certain we are the children of God by faith; and the catechism is not quite honest where it says "The promises of God made to them in this sacrament," because they are called on to be instructed in the principles of the Christian religion, and to profess their faith as set forth in the formula of the Apostles creed, and they are baptized in that faith, not faith in the promises made to them in the sacrament. Nay, these promises are rehearsed, and they are required to believe in something else -- "God's holy word." But I feel it better to inquire into the substance of the truth in scripture as contrasted with ritualistic doctrine, than to spell out the confusion introduced by the breaking of light into the popish system, and the mixture of doctrinal light and ancient traditions and forms, increased by the partial return to catholic sentiments in the time of Charles II.

		<a class="footnote" name="#361:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>The offering of Himself to be a sacrifice was impossible when once *anenegke eauton* and offering Himself to be a sacrifice is the force of *prospherein*. Once consumed on the altar there could be no further offering to God. It will he well to notice what the divine order of offerings was. If a person would bring an offering to Jehovah, he was to bring it near ihiaqorv. This was the technical term for bringing it up as an offering, was the mere physical act of making it come. He or some one slew the victim if of cattle. The priest took the blood and sprinkled it on the altar of burnt offering, or on that before the mercy seat, as the case might be. Then he laid on the altar (after washing when needed) the part that was to be burned there, the whole carcase or the fat, as the case might be, in order, and (hiaqmiyor) burned it as sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire, when such was its character, on the altar. *Prospherein* is the Greek word used for the bringing it as an offering to God: *anapherein* for its being actually offered up to God and burned upon the altar. The offerer did the first, the priest and the fire from God did the last. The priest's office did not begin till after the offerer had brought his offering. When the victim, or its fat, or even the *Mincha* or meat offering, had been consumed on the altar, the essence of the act was that that was absolutely and completely done, gone up to God *(hola)*, consumed as here, and mounted up to God as a sweet savour, an offering made by fire *(Ishshee)*. The thought of any new offering, *prosphora* presenting it to God, was impossible. It would have been the setting aside of the burning on the altar, the completeness of the sacrifice to God by fire, as having all gone up to Him as a sweet savour. The value of the blood of Christ, is eternal with God, assuredly; the sweet savour of His sacrifice ever before Him, but an offering of Himself by Christ after He had been sacrificed on the divine altar to God, could not enter into the mind of one who knew what sacrifice was. Christ prosenegken eauton amomon to Theo* (Hebrews 9); so *eauton anenegke* was an actual offering (offered himself) up to God upon the cross. (Hebrews 7.) (Compare James 2: 21). (If the LXX be consulted, the distinctive use of *anaphero*, as the actual offering on the altar, becomes quite clear.) The victim is said to bear the sins when he has been presented by the offerer, but only after he has become an offered victim. So Christ (Hebrews 9: 28) was once offered to bear the sins of many, *prosenechtheis eis to anenegkein.* Here He is viewed as a sin-offering: but an offering or presenting the slain victim after it had been on the altar, and the fire of God had consumed the sacrifice as taught by scripture.
