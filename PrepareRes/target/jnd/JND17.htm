		PRACTICAL REFLECTIONS ON THE PSALMS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My purpose in this series of papers is not to interpret the Psalms, but to draw from them some portion of the spiritual instruction and edification they afford our souls.<a name=1:1></a> The interpretation has been sought to be given elsewhere.<a name=1:2></a> The Psalms afford us special light on the government of God and the sympathies of the Spirit of Christ with His people.<a name=1:3></a> This, in the first instance, has the Jews for its object and centre of display.<a name=1:4></a> Still, in making allowance for the difference of their state and ours, and of the relationship of a people with Jehovah and children with a Father, God's ways in government apply to us Christians also.<a name=1:5></a> If it is not the highest ground on which a Christian is viewed, for that is heavenly; it is a most important and interesting one, and brings out all the tenderest displays of divine care, the care of Him who counts the very hairs of our head, and the seriousness and vigilance required in walking before God, who never swerves from His holy ways, who is not mocked, nor withdraws His eyes from the righteous, though all be the ministration of His grace for perfecting us according to these ways before Him.<a name=1:6></a> Of this application of the government of God to the Christian's ways, the Epistles of Peter are more especially the witness.<a name=1:7></a> See, for example, 1 Peter 1: 17; chapter 3: 10-15, and the spirit and tenor of the whole Epistle.<a name=1:8></a> This government in the second Epistle is carried on to the consummation of all things.<a name=1:9></a> The first is more the government of the righteous, the second the judgment of the wicked, though that judgment, as closing the power of evil and the deliverance of the just, be alluded to in the first also.<a name=1:10></a> He was the apostle of the circumcision, and this subject came specially under his eye in teaching.<a name=1:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Psalm 1.<a name=1:12></a> This government in the earth is plainly pointed out in the first psalm, and the character of those whom that government blesses.<a name=1:13></a> He it is who keeps separate from the wicked in his way, and delights in the law of Jehovah, and meditates on it.<a name=1:14></a> Submission to the Christ, as the depositary of this government in God's counsels at the close of this time of trial, is the subject of the second.<a name=1:15></a> Only a few words on the first of these two psalms, which lay the basis of all the rest.<a name=1:16></a> The counsel of the ungodly, the way of sinners, and the seat of the scornful are avoided.<a name=1:17></a> While here connected with human responsibility in walk, yet it is being kept from the evil.<a name=1:18></a> I do not desire to spin out the force of the words, but a few remarks may be made on these words.<a name=1:19></a> The ungodly have plans, counsels of their own will, their own way of viewing things, and arrangements to obtain their purpose.<a name=1:20></a> There the just is not found.<a name=1:21></a> The sinner has a path in which he walks, pleasing himself there: the just does not walk with him.<a name=1:22></a> The scornful are at ease, despising God: there the just will not sit.<a name=1:23></a> Judgment will come, and such will not be allowed to stand in the congregation of the just then brought to rest by the glory of God.<a name=1:24></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Psalm 2.<a name=2:1></a> This psalm announces the establishment of Christ's earthly triumph and royalty in Zion, when the heathen shall be given Him for an inheritance.<a name=2:2></a> This is not yet fulfilled.<a name=2:3></a> The government of God does not secure the good from suffering as it will then, but turns suffering to spiritual blessing, and restrains the remainder of wrath, giving a glorious reward for our little sorrows.<a name=2:4></a> But for us a Father's name is revealed in them.<a name=2:5></a> We call on the Father who, without respect of persons, judges according to every man's work, and we pass the time of our sojourning here in fear, knowing that we are redeemed.<a name=2:6></a> Here kings are called on to submit before the coming judgment of the earth.<a name=2:7></a> But this is not yet executed, and we have to learn our own lesson in patience.<a name=2:8></a> This the Psalms will teach us.<a name=2:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Psalm 3.<a name=2:10></a> Let us see the lessons of the first psalms which follow.<a name=2:11></a> Troublers are multiplied, but the first thought of faith is Jehovah.<a name=2:12></a> There the spirit is at home, and looks at troublers from thence.<a name=2:13></a> Jehovah is thus trusted.<a name=2:14></a> When Jehovah comes in the heart <i>before</i> those that trouble me, all is well.<a name=2:15></a> Our spirits see Him concerned in matters, and are at peace.<a name=2:16></a> He is a glory, shield, and lifter up.<a name=2:17></a> Another point is, it is not a lazy, listless, view of evil and good, nor listless confidence.<a name=2:18></a> Desire and dependence are active, the links of the soul with Jehovah.<a name=2:19></a> I <i>cried</i>, and lie heard.<a name=2:20></a> That is certain.<a name=2:21></a> That is the confidence that, if we ask anything according to His will He hears, and if He hears, we have the petition.<a name=2:22></a> We do not desire, if sincere, to have anything not according to His will; but it is an immense thing, in the midst of trial and difficulty, to be sure of God's hearing, and God's arm in what is according to His will.<a name=2:23></a> Hence rest and peace.<a name=2:24></a> "I laid me down and slept; I awaked: for Jehovah sustained me.<a name=2:25></a>" How emphatic and simple!<a name=2:26></a> Is it so with you, reader?<a name=2:27></a> Does all trouble find your heart so resting on God as your Father, that, when it is multiplied, it leaves your spirit at rest, your sleep sweet, lying down sleeping, and rising as if all was peace around you, because you know God is and disposes of all things?<a name=2:28></a> Is He thus between you and your troubles and troublers?<a name=2:29></a> And if He is, what can reach you?<a name=2:30></a> The thousands of enemies make no difference if God is there.<a name=2:31></a> The Assyrian is gone before he can arise to trouble or execute the threats, which, after all, betray his conscious fear.<a name=2:32></a> We are foolish as to difficulties and trials, measuring them by our strength instead of God's, who is for us if we are His.<a name=2:33></a> What matter that the cities of Canaan were walled up to heaven, if the walls fell at the blast of a ram's horn?<a name=2:34></a> Could Peter have walked on a smooth sea better than on a rough one?<a name=2:35></a> Our wisdom is to know that we -- can do nothing without Jesus -- with Him everything that is according to His will.<a name=2:36></a> The secret of peace is to be occupied with Him for His own sake, and we shall find peace in Him and through Him, and be more than conquerors when trouble comes; not that we shall be insensible to trial, but find Him and His tender care with us when trouble comes.<a name=2:37></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Psalm 4.<a name=3:1></a> This psalm affords us another most important principle, the effect of a good conscience in calling upon God in our distress.<a name=3:2></a> It is not here a good conscience as justified from sin, but a practically good conscience, giving confidence towards God.<a name=3:3></a> If our heart condemn us not, says the apostle, then have we confidence towards God.<a name=3:4></a> "Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness.<a name=3:5></a>" He does not say, Justify me, O God of my righteousness; but, Hear me, The soul is in trouble, yet had been enlarged, had had experience of God's faithful lovingkindness.<a name=3:6></a> His glory and honour was from God, How true this was of Christ!<a name=3:7></a> Man turned it into shame, and sought after vanity.<a name=3:8></a> Still it remained unalterably true, in the divine government of Him who cannot deny Himself, that He has set apart the godly for Himself.<a name=3:9></a> They are Thine, says Christ.<a name=3:10></a> We are a peculiar people to Himself.<a name=3:11></a> Now this is always true, but in walking in godliness we have the present confidence of it, and our eye sees God brightly, and we know then He will hear us.<a name=3:12></a> We have not lost the perception of what He is at the present moment for us.<a name=3:13></a> Our soul is not beclouded, and nothing is so soon clouded as present dependence on and confidence in God.<a name=3:14></a> Integrity, when there is dependence, gives courage.<a name=3:15></a> It is not that God will not hear us from the depths of contrition, but this is another thing.<a name=3:16></a> Integrity of heart gives confidence in the day of trouble, because God is seen by the spirit.<a name=3:17></a> The eye is then fixed on Him across all the trouble.<a name=3:18></a> And so it is here: Commune with your own heart and be still worship God in integrity, without fear, and trust in Him.<a name=3:19></a> In what is around us, many might say, Where is any good to be found?<a name=3:20></a> and, discouraged and disheartened, despair of finding any; but in and through all circumstances the light of God's countenance is the secure and unchangeable good.<a name=3:21></a> His favour is better than life.<a name=3:22></a> Besides, it secures good.<a name=3:23></a> The power of evil is below the power of God.<a name=3:24></a> He disposes of it, removes it, turns it to blessing, annuls it as He sees fit.<a name=3:25></a> The light of His countenance does this for faith.<a name=3:26></a> And the soul rises above evil, and rejoices in God.<a name=3:27></a> Hence there is more joy than in temporal blessings.<a name=3:28></a> They may be taken away: besides, they are not God Himself, and the light of His Countenance in trouble is altogether Himself, and gives the secret to the soul of His being for us.<a name=3:29></a> Hence one lies down in peace and sleeps -- does not disquiet himself in anxious watchfulness against evil, for after all it is God only that secures him in joy or trouble.<a name=3:30></a>

		Psalm 5 furnishes the occasion of saying a word on the calls for judgment which are many times found in the book, and with that I shall pass it over.<a name=4:1></a> There is constancy of cry in the presence of enemies.<a name=4:2></a> It is to Jehovah the tried one looks; but it is on the ground of that righteous character and government of God which makes it impossible for Him to look on evil complacently.<a name=4:3></a> He will destroy the violent and deceitful man.<a name=4:4></a> And this is right.<a name=4:5></a> The Christian feels God ought not to let successful evil go on for ever.<a name=4:6></a> When his mind rests on the government of God, he looks for the removal of evil by judgment, and rejoices in it; not in thinking of the evil doer, but of the righteousness and the result.<a name=4:7></a> Vengeance belongs to God.<a name=4:8></a> But it is in no way the element He lives in.<a name=4:9></a> The Jew having his portion in the earth -- "for the meek shall inherit the earth, and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace" -- looks for the removal of the violent and deceitful man, in order to his own comfort and rest.<a name=4:10></a> Not so the Christian.<a name=4:11></a> He leaves the violent man here and goes to heaven.<a name=4:12></a> He walks, as to his personal walk, in the time of grace, and leaves it for glory.<a name=4:13></a> Even in the millennium, when government will be exercised and the wicked cut off, his distinctive place is grace.<a name=4:14></a> The river of water flows out of the city; the leaves of the tree of life, of which he eats the full ripe fruit, are for the healing of the nations.<a name=4:15></a> Now his place is wholly grace and patience.<a name=4:16></a> He does well, suffers for it, and takes it patiently, and knows this is acceptable with God.<a name=4:17></a> He would overcome evil with good.<a name=4:18></a> He sees the evil, knows it will be judged, that the judgment shall devour the adversaries, and, viewed as adversaries, can be glad that they are removed from hindering good.<a name=4:19></a> Righteous judgment, I repeat, his soul owns and acquiesces in.<a name=4:20></a> But he looks not for it for his own gain or liberty.<a name=4:21></a> He is above this in grace.<a name=4:22></a> And this was Christ's place.<a name=4:23></a> He will execute judgment.<a name=4:24></a> His Spirit calls in these Psalms for judgment.<a name=4:25></a> But as walking on earth, in which He was a personal pattern for us, He did not call for judgment on His enemies.<a name=4:26></a> "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do," was His word when their violence was directed against Himself; and in judgment He opened not His mouth.<a name=4:27></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Psalm 5 takes up the call for judgment according to God's government of the earth, founded on Jehovah's immutable character, and looks for the happiness and joy of Jehovah's people flowing from it.<a name=5:1></a> And so it will; but not ours, because our joy is in heaven, where such deliverances are not needed.<a name=5:2></a> We leave the earth.<a name=5:3></a> Hence, while the spirit sees and feels the rightness of this psalm, I do not give it as in any way the experience of a Christian, save that his cry in difficulty and trial is undividedly and actively directed to the Lord -- we may say to the Father.<a name=5:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Psalm 6 and 7 both partake of this character and call for judgment.<a name=5:5></a> But Psalm 6 is on very different ground from Psalm 5, and in certain respects will afford us experimental light for the Christian.<a name=5:6></a> When the believing soul is under trial, the recurrence to God as its resource and hope is the natural movement of faith; the great grace of God in being for us, the sense that there is nothing like this love, and the confidence which accompanies submission of heart, draw out the heart towards Him.<a name=5:7></a> Nor is there a sweeter time for the soul that trusts Him than the time of trial.<a name=5:8></a> This supposes indeed the will to be broken, and the heart subject, and God's love to be known.<a name=5:9></a> When this is not the case, the trial through grace works submission and is then removed, or the soul finds its happiness in the wise and holy will of God, and in the fruit it bears.<a name=5:10></a> But there is another case where trial, though ever salutary and gracious, has another element in which it makes confiding love to God more difficult.<a name=5:11></a> I mean where the trial has its source in the conduct of the person suffering.<a name=5:12></a> If I have brought trial on myself by sin, how difficult to see love in it!<a name=5:13></a> how difficult not to groan in the consciousness that it is the fruit of sin, and just rebuke for it, and hence that we have no right to think of love in it!<a name=5:14></a> Yet where can we turn but to Him?<a name=5:15></a> and how look to Him to deliver whom we have offended?<a name=5:16></a> Such is the real and distressing difficulty of a soul which, feeling that it has brought sorrow on itself, feels it has no right to took for deliverance.<a name=5:17></a> It is indeed almost tempted to despair and sink under the sense of hopelessness.<a name=5:18></a> This was the force of our Lord's intercession for Peter, that his faith might not fail, his confidence in Christ and his love and hope of divine favour not be lost, or he might fall into the hands of Satan through despair and remorse.<a name=5:19></a> In his case it was not trial or chastening, but the danger was the same.<a name=5:20></a> Faith hinders this despairing feeling, but it does not take away the sense of sin or of the justness of rebuke; but it trusts God and His love and goodness, which now take the character of mercy to the spirit of the sufferer.<a name=5:21></a> The sense of sin is deeper, the dread of consequences less, and God is trusted with a humbled heart in spite of all.<a name=5:22></a> Still it is felt that rebuke is deserved -- nay, the soul may be in a measure under it.<a name=5:23></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is the state brought before us in Psalm 6.<a name=6:1></a> It pleads the distress and desolateness under which it is lying, and looks for mercy, and pleads that the rebuke may not be in anger.<a name=6:2></a> It has confidence in God, though in presence of the thought that the rebuke of His anger would be but the natural consequence.<a name=6:3></a> It owns the justness of this, yet resting in faith on grace says, How long?<a name=6:4></a> God cannot cast off for ever those who trust in Him: light will spring up.<a name=6:5></a> There is relationship with God and faith counts on it.<a name=6:6></a> So that the heart can plead its extreme sorrow and trial with a God whose compassions are known.<a name=6:7></a> The last three verses express this confidence fully.<a name=6:8></a> We see how the government of God applies to this world, so that death has the character, in that government, when so failing on any one, of cutting off.<a name=6:9></a> This was fully true with the Jew, as we see in Hezekiah and even in Job.<a name=6:10></a> But it is true in a measure as to the Christian.<a name=6:11></a> There are sins unto death, and death may have the character of discipline, as in 1 Corinthians 11, and may be arrested, as we read in James' and John's epistles.<a name=6:12></a> The Psalm does not look beyond it, save into darkness, nor does the government of God either.<a name=6:13></a> When the believer has peace, he looks at discipline, even when justly severe, in the sense of certain divine favour.<a name=6:14></a> Hence his horror of sin is of a much purer kind, for it abhors the sin and not its consequences.<a name=6:15></a> It may be that the fiery darts of the wicked reach him or that dread threatens him at least.<a name=6:16></a> He looks through it to God's mercy and faithfulness.<a name=6:17></a> His faith through Christ's intercession does not fail.<a name=6:18></a> Still this is a terrible state; but the heart clings to God and can say, How long?<a name=6:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Psalm 7 is a full and elaborate appeal to righteousness and vengeance, and faith in that judgment.<a name=7:1></a> Thus the congregation of the peoples of the earth will own Jehovah and compass Him about.<a name=7:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He looks for God's anger on the wicked as he deprecated it for himself, and he expects it with a certain faith.<a name=7:3></a> This we do and own it all to be most right and excellent; but I cannot give the Psalm as presenting anything of the experience of the Christian, save the consciousness of integrity and the fact of trusting God.<a name=7:4></a> It is all true and certain; but it is for those who are in the distress produced by the haughty wicked, and look for deliverance, yet not to suffer like and with Christ that they may be glorified together, that the psalm provides an expression of feeling.<a name=7:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Psalm 8 is the celebration of Jehovah's millennial dominion and the glory of the Son of man in connection with, and in the mouth of, the Jewish people.<a name=7:6></a> But the psalm gives us a most interesting insight into the glory of Christ, and, as far as is possible in the Old Testament, our association with Him.<a name=7:7></a> It views man, set as the image of the invisible God, ruler over creation.<a name=7:8></a> It does not, and could not in direct revelation, go beyond man's place in this world, for the mystery was not revealed in the Old Testament; but Adam was the image of Him that was to come, Jehovah is the Lord of Israel.<a name=7:9></a> What is man?<a name=7:10></a> Christ is the answer.<a name=7:11></a> But He is Jehovah, and His glory set above the heavens, the earth put under His feet.<a name=7:12></a> Even in the days of His humiliation, the enemy and avenger was stilled by babes and sucklings uttering His praise; for the Father took care that, if for His sake the Lord was despised and rejected of men, there should be the testimony to His glory; and so it was, as Son of God, Son of David (as to which these words are quoted), and Son of man.<a name=7:13></a> (See John 11 and 12.<a name=7:14></a>) But in that day His name will be excellent in all the earth, Meanwhile He is crowned with glory and honour, even while all things are not put under Him.<a name=7:15></a> As a mere creature, man is small and feeble.<a name=7:16></a> But the Man of God's counsel, the last Adam, is over all.<a name=7:17></a> See Proverbs 8, where, before the creation, Christ is seen as the wisdom of God, Jehovah's delight, and His delight in the sons of men.<a name=7:18></a> So, when He was born, the angels celebrate God's delight in (not "goodwill towards") men.<a name=7:19></a> What is man?<a name=7:20></a> is asked by Job, irritated.<a name=7:21></a> Why could God not let him alone?<a name=7:22></a> (Job 7: 17.<a name=7:23></a>) And in Psalm 144, why should God so patiently spare the wicked?<a name=7:24></a> But here it is Man in the counsels of God, the last Adam, the second Man, Christ, the glory of Jehovah, set as Man above the heavens, and the earth subject under His feet, yea, all things, which as yet we see not, only the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ crowned with glory and honour, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death.<a name=7:25></a>

		I pass over Psalms 9 and 10 -- the former celebrating the judgment of the enemies of Israel, the latter descriptive of the wickedness of their oppressors, They express the consciousness during the oppression that God does see it, and does not forget the humble; and then, on the deliverance, they celebrate the faithfulness of Jehovah.<a name=8:1></a> The <i>world</i> is judged in righteousness, and Jehovah known by the judgment which He executes.<a name=8:2></a> I have only to draw the reader's serious attention to the judgment of the world here spoken of, and the main scene of it in the land of Israel; while in every case, the humble soul in oppression and trial may walk in peaceful assurance that God sees it, and that its cause is in the hands of God; yea, what is more difficult, that when it has brought it on itself, if truly humbled, it may count on God.<a name=8:3></a> I now turn to the expression of the feeling of those who are in the trial before the deliverance comes, and while they have to possess their souls in patience.<a name=8:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Psalm 11 sees distinctly -- as is always true, though not publicly manifested as at that time -- that there is no hope from, no reliance on, man on the earth -- that nothing earthly is stable, and that evil has brought in ruin.<a name=8:5></a> The foundations are cast down, and what are the righteous to do?<a name=8:6></a> This, for faith, is true, since the time that Christ was rejected on earth; only the restraining hand of God checks the power of evil, as long as patience can be exercised, and there are souls yet to be drawn out to the fellowship of Christ.<a name=8:7></a> It will be openly the case when the wicked one wields power in the earth, before God arises to judgment, and to help all the meek of the earth.<a name=8:8></a> Cases of peculiar trial bring us often into analogous circumstances in our own little sphere.<a name=8:9></a> Only we must remember that we have to do with a Father known as such, who disciplines us for our profit, for our heavenly and eternal gain, with a well-known love which has not spared His own Son, but delivered Him up for us.<a name=8:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The question put in the psalm is: If the foundations be cast down, what can the righteous do?<a name=9:1></a> -- what they might refer to as of divine stability?<a name=9:2></a> For good does not exist, and the wicked are disturbed by no scruple of conscience, and with fraud of heart seek to destroy the righteous.<a name=9:3></a> There is a time when the Lord warns to flee, when no action and no patience is of any avail.<a name=9:4></a> This is not the case here.<a name=9:5></a> It is only so when God delivers up all to the wicked for a time, Fear and unbelief would urge flight, as a bird, away from the scene to a place of refuge and human security.<a name=9:6></a> Faith looks higher.<a name=9:7></a> "In Jehovah put I my trust.<a name=9:8></a>" Trust in Jehovah, who is above all, to whom nothing is unknown, whom nothing escapes, whose faithfulness is unchangeable, without whom not a sparrow falls to the ground, who, after all, orders everything, whatever man's plans are, who is our Father.<a name=9:9></a> Trust in Him is the resource and peace-giving feeling of the righteous.<a name=9:10></a> This, in its nature, gives a perfect walk and calmness at all times; because circumstances do not govern the feelings, and the soul has no motive to lead it but the will of God, and can have boldness to do it when called on, through confidence in Him.<a name=9:11></a> It gives calmness too, because God is trusted for every result.<a name=9:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the simple fact of this confidence is not all the psalm teaches us.<a name=9:13></a> All is subverted and in confusion on earth; no security for the righteous there.<a name=9:14></a> But Jehovah is in His holy temple; His throne is in heaven; and His eyes behold, His eyelids try, the children of men.<a name=9:15></a> He does not slumber nor sleep; the righteous may leave his cause to Him.<a name=9:16></a> But there is, besides this, an explanation of God's ways in the time of sorrow.<a name=9:17></a> Jehovah tries the righteous.<a name=9:18></a> When His eyelids, who sees all things according to His own purity, try the children of men, He has an object as regards the righteous; He proves and sifts them.<a name=9:19></a> This is a most important truth -- the activity of God in dealing with the righteous, to accomplish His own gracious purposes as to them, to manifest His own character, to judge, and lead them to judge, all that is not according to it, and thus give them the intelligence of what He is, and conform them morally to it, at the same time subjecting their wills, and engaging their affections, by the sense of His faithfulness and love.<a name=9:20></a> The breaking of the will is a great means of opening the understanding.<a name=9:21></a>

		Psalm 14 is an eminent example of a principle of very frequent application: how psalms or other passages of scripture, clearly applicable literally to the Jews in the last days, and to events then occurring, are used as great principles deciding morally on important truths at all times -- truths which are then publicly and judicially brought to light.<a name=13:20></a> The apostle applies this psalm as the expression of the divine judgment on the state of the Jews, as declared in their own scriptures, and proving the need of a righteousness not their own.<a name=13:21></a> I have not much to remark on it here.<a name=13:22></a> We may expect to meet with difficulties which arise from a total absence of the fear of God in those with whom we have to do.<a name=13:23></a> It is hardly credible for one that fears God, that this can be so, that there should be no compunction nothing that stays the heart in wickedness, at least in deliberate wickedness, But we must expect this sometimes, where we should least expect it.<a name=13:24></a> But Jehovah sees all this.<a name=13:25></a> This is our confidence.<a name=13:26></a> He may take time, be patient with evil, or at least with evil doers, and exercise us; but He sees it all.<a name=13:27></a> Not only so, but God Himself is in the generation of the righteous.<a name=13:28></a> There is an influence produced by the presence of God with the righteous, which the enemies of Jehovah feel, and which in the righteous is known only by faith.<a name=13:29></a> We may see an example in what Rahab evidently saw among the Canaanites; Joshua 2: 9.<a name=13:30></a> The same feeling is referred to in Philippians 1: 28.<a name=13:31></a> This feeling of fear, in those who oppose the truth, may be accompanied with boasting and violence; but when faith has confidence in Jehovah, the wicked, even if they succeed, have always fear.<a name=13:32></a> So the Jews, even when they had crucified Christ, feared lest, after all, His absence from the tomb should make matters worse than before, But there must be the sense of God's presence for the righteous to be thus sustained.<a name=13:33></a>

		Psalm 16.<a name=15:1></a> With these few remarks I pass on to Psalm 16, which applies directly to Christ, but in which we shall find the sweetest instruction also for ourselves.<a name=15:2></a> It is essentially Christ taking the place of a man, and pointing out the path of life before Him through death, since He came for us, but trusting in Jehovah, into His presence, where is fulness of joy.<a name=15:3></a> We must not lose sight of the direct prophetic character; still this path is an example for us.<a name=15:4></a> The good Shepherd has gone before the sheep.<a name=15:5></a> The great principle proposed in the psalm is trust in the Lord, even in death -- the place of dependent obedience; and the Lord Himself's being the whole portion of man excluded all inconsistent with this; we may add, having Him always in view.<a name=15:6></a> These are the great principles of divine life, and of divine life come into the scene of sin and death.<a name=15:7></a> No doubt we should speak of communion with the Father and His Son Jesus Christ in this path of life; but the great moral principles, the subjective state of soul, is brought out before us here, and that in Christ Himself.<a name=15:8></a> And note here, it is His perfection as man, and before God and towards God.<a name=15:9></a> It is not divine perfection, God manifested to man, but what He was as man dependent on God.<a name=15:10></a> We have not even His offering Himself, in which we have also to follow Him (1 John 3: 16), but His place as man in perfection.<a name=15:11></a> It is perfectness before God -- the principle that governed Him.<a name=15:12></a> Hence even the word, "My goodness extendeth not to thee," has its application also to us.<a name=15:13></a> That our goodness does not actually reach God, it might seem almost absurd to affirm; but when it is applied to Christ as man, who was absolutely perfect, it affords us an apprehension of the nature of this goodness, a principle which we can apply to ourselves, and which puts us in our place.<a name=15:14></a> It is man's perfection towards God, the new path of which Christ is the perfection and example in the earth.<a name=15:15></a> But this thought shews the unspeakably blessed place which we have as Christians, though in our own case in the midst not only of weakness but of internal conflicts which were not in Christ, in whom was no sin.<a name=15:16></a> But Christ's place is the perfect expression of our place before God.<a name=15:17></a> This is fully unfolded at the close of the Gospel of John, and particularly in chapter 17.<a name=15:18></a>

		The Epistle of John too, which first presents Christ as the manifestation on earth of that eternal life which was with the Father (its manifestation in a man whom their hands had touched), teaches that this was true in Christians as in Him (1 John 2: 8), and unfolds the character of this life in righteousness and in love, adding the presence of the Holy Ghost, through which we can dwell in God and God in us.<a name=15:19></a> We have this eternal life, which is come down from heaven but is only said to be in the Son, yet he who has the Son has it; indeed, this gives it all its value.<a name=15:20></a> No doubt the Epistle of John unfolds it in all its extent and value, as it cannot be unfolded in the Psalms: still in this psalm we have Christ taking the place itself as amongst the excellent of the earth.<a name=15:21></a> I may remark here that the writings of John, though intimating it and just shewing that we shall be with Christ above, do not pursue this life to its presentation in glory before God.<a name=15:22></a> This is Paul's office; indeed, he had only so seen Christ.<a name=15:23></a> John presents the life in itself and manifested on earth.<a name=15:24></a> The life is the light of men.<a name=15:25></a>

		The expression, "My goodness extendeth not to thee," would not suit the divine manifestation of goodness on the earth.<a name=16:13></a> But, taking His place entirely as a man here, the Lord shews us the true place of man living to God; not in his innocence, not surely in sin, but the very opposite; but perfect, in a world of sin; in righteousness and true holiness, having the knowledge of good and evil, tempted but separate from sin and sinners; not made higher than the heavens, but fit for it in the desires of His nature, and in the path towards it dependent, obedient, taking no place with God, but before Him as responsible as man upon earth, and looking towards the place of perfect blessedness as man with God by being in is presence, which would be fulness of joy for Him: a place which, when having His nature, we can have with Christ.<a name=16:14></a> It is man trusting God, deriving His pleasure and joy from God, living by faith, and in that sense apart from Him -- not God manifested in the flesh, which we know was also true of the blessed Lord.<a name=16:15></a> This, while it is our place on earth as sanctified through the truth, is above the place of the Jewish remnant.<a name=16:16></a> We have another in the consciousness of union with Christ through the Holy Ghost.<a name=16:17></a>

		The state described in this psalm is that of man considered apart from God (I do not mean, of course, morally separated, nor touch upon the union of the divine and human nature in Christ); but it is man partaker of the divine nature, for so only it could be, but having God for his object, his confidence, as alone having authority over him, entirely dependent on God, and perfect in faith in Him.<a name=17:8></a> This could only be in one personally partaker of the divine nature, God Himself in man, as Christ was, or derivatively as in one born of God; but, as we have seen, Christ is not here viewed in this aspect nor the believer as united to Him.<a name=17:9></a> The divine presence in Him is viewed, not in the manifestation of God in Him, but in its effect in His absolute perfection as man.<a name=17:10></a> He is walking as man morally in view of God.<a name=17:11></a> Christ here depends on Jehovah for His resurrection.<a name=17:12></a> He says, "<i>Thou</i> wilt not leave," though He could say, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.<a name=17:13></a>" Yet He could say, as perfect Man, "Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit.<a name=17:14></a>" As Peter among the Jews could say, He hath made Him whom ye have crucified both Lord and Christ: while Thomas could say, My Lord and my God.<a name=17:15></a> Indeed Peter never leaves this ground -- the rejected Man, the Messiah, exalted by God -- nor preaches the Son of God (as Paul did at once in the synagogues), though the first, by divine revelation, to confess Him such.<a name=17:16></a>

		It was free submission and dependence, but perfect submission and dependence -- the one right thing <i>in the position</i> which He had taken.<a name=18:11></a> This was perfect faith.<a name=18:12></a> He was the leader and completer of faith -- absence of self, dependence, and confidence.<a name=18:13></a> And, we may add, the word of God was the revelation on which He acted, that which He obeyed, the weapon He used, as we see in His temptation in the desert.<a name=18:14></a> He was the word and the truth personally, and all He said expressed what He was; John 8: 25.<a name=18:15></a> But it is not less true that He used and acted on and obeyed the Scriptures as Man.<a name=18:16></a> But here He takes the place of dependence and confidence.<a name=18:17></a> As Man, He says, "Preserve me, O God.<a name=18:18></a> In thee do I put my trust.<a name=18:19></a>"

		The next point, partly anticipated necessarily in what I have said, is entire subservience to the will of God.<a name=18:20></a> Here to God, as <i>revealed</i> among the Jews, Jehovah; to us it would be the Father and the Son -- one God, even the Father, and one Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=18:21></a> "Thou hast said unto Jehovah, Thou art my Lord.<a name=18:22></a>" Remark, "Thou hast said.<a name=18:23></a>" He had taken this place, He was Jehovah, but not taking that place at all here in His path.<a name=18:24></a> In the form of God, thinking it no robbery to be equal with God, He had taken the form of a servant, and was found in fashion as a man -- freely taken, perfectly preserved in, through death, His taken place through humiliation.<a name=18:25></a> Freely to take it is a divine title and action.<a name=18:26></a> Creatures have to keep their own; though, when not kept by God, none have done so.<a name=18:27></a> His given, but deserved, place as Man is glory; John 17.<a name=18:28></a> He humbles Himself, and is highly exalted.<a name=18:29></a> He had said to Jehovah, "Thou art my Lord that is, I am subservient to Thee.<a name=18:30></a> He had taken a <i>place</i>, while never ceasing to be God, and which Godhead alone could fulfil the conditions of, outside Godhead; but in which as man to satisfy God, to glorify God in an earth of apostasy and sin, indeed with all on earth and Satan's power against Him -- at the close, even God's wrath, if to fulfil His glory in righteousness.<a name=18:31></a>

		But, further, there were objects of divine favour from whom He did not dissociate Himself.<a name=19:6></a> But He does not speak of them as chosen by Himself here -- as in John of His disciples, "Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you" (though there also for service), nor as chosen of God in grace, but as objects of divine delight in the path they trod, as manifested morally -- those who were in the path He had to tread in -- "the saints that are in the earth, the excellent.<a name=19:7></a>" This is full of interest.<a name=19:8></a> It is still His moral place as man, delighting in what God delighted in, as becomes one perfect with God, as we see in full figure in Moses Hebrews 11: 24-26.<a name=19:9></a> He takes His place with the saints -- those really sanctified to God.<a name=19:10></a> This we see in fact, and in the way of the most perfect obedience and humiliation, in that the Saviour went to be baptised with the baptism of John, when those moved by the Spirit of God to humble themselves went there.<a name=19:11></a> In the first and lowest step of divine life, that of the heart giving itself up to God in the acknowledgment of sin, He who knew no sin went with those who owned it; for their owning it was divine life, and it was consecrating themselves to God.<a name=19:12></a> They were the true excellent of the earth, How sweet and consoling in the wilderness to see Christ treading this path, victorious over all temptation in it, as shewn directly after His baptism by John; binding the strong man, in life possessed of, and victorious over, all the power of the enemy.<a name=19:13></a>

		One sees easily here, that though it be the divine life, the fruit of grace, it is not in itself God manifesting Himself, a goodness in its character in itself reaching to God; for it was owning sin, though it was divine grace in Christ to do it.<a name=20:1></a> Just as it was not properly of God, as such, to die; though nothing but the perfect love, that is, One who was God Himself, could have died as Christ did, given Himself, laid down His life, given a motive to His Father to love Him for what He did.<a name=20:2></a> We see One acting as man in man's place (only absolutely, perfectly, and freely as loving the Father, which He could not have done if not divine) before God and towards God as men had to act.<a name=20:3></a> That a divine Person should do this has a value beyond all thought, and it is what, as much else, the blessed Saviour did for us, a man in our place, that is, in the perfection of it as God's delight, and according to what it ought to be, in the midst of this sinful world, what glorified God in it.<a name=20:4></a>

		The view which we have taken of this divine life, perfect in itself, but displayed in a knowledge of good and evil and proved in the midst of evil -- in us renewed in knowledge according to the image of Him that created us -- is brought out distinctly in positive separation from evil, but especially in the motive and spring of life, the confession of Jehovah.<a name=20:11></a> He (verse 4) repels all that can be called another God.<a name=20:12></a> He will have nothing at all to say to it.<a name=20:13></a> It is absolute rejection.<a name=20:14></a> He cleaves to Jehovah.<a name=20:15></a> Fidelity to Jehovah characterises the life of Christ as so walking on earth.<a name=20:16></a> We can say fidelity to Christ Himself.<a name=20:17></a> Christ is all and in all.<a name=20:18></a> Jehovah is not only Lord to obey, He is the portion of His inheritance.<a name=20:19></a> He sought nought else; as of the priest of old and yet better, as in heart and desire, the Lord was His inheritance and the portion of His cup, His lot here, which He had to drink; His enjoyment in hope, His portion by the way.<a name=20:20></a>

		This, I apprehend, is the difference between heritage and cup.<a name=21:1></a> The inheritance is the permanent portion of the soul; the cup, what its feelings are occupied with, what comes to a man to occupy his spirit by the way.<a name=21:2></a> He gives the cup of wrath to the wicked to drink; the blessed Lord had to drink the cup of wrath on the cross.<a name=21:3></a> "My cup runneth over" -- was filled to overflow with blessing; so we say, habitually, it was a bitter cup.<a name=21:4></a> It is not merely the circumstances we pass through, unless the soul be subject to them; but that which we taste in the circumstances, what our spirits feel, that which presses on them in the circumstances.<a name=21:5></a> Thus, in Psalm 23, the circumstances were all sorrowful, but Jehovah being shepherd, all through them, his cup ran over with joy and blessing.<a name=21:6></a> Thus Jehovah was the permanent portion of the heart of Christ and, as walking through this world, that on which His heart rested -- what formed and characterised His feelings more than the sorrow He went through, save on the cross.<a name=21:7></a> "My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.<a name=21:8></a>" Man (no, not even His disciples) never entered into His thoughts.<a name=21:9></a> One who sat at His feet once in affection felt that to which He could give a voice but only to bring out more sadly the failure of all else; but He had meat to eat they knew not of.<a name=21:10></a> Jehovah was the portion of His cup, nearer than all circumstances which otherwise could have pressed upon His heart as man, and which He fully felt, if we except the cross, or rather indeed more than ever there, for it was the wrath of Jehovah Himself that pressed upon His soul in the cup He then drank.<a name=21:11></a>

		But otherwise so truly was Jehovah the great circumstance and substance of His life in and through everything, that He could only wish that His joy might be fulfilled in His disciples.<a name=22:1></a> But then it was from Jehovah only, and therein His perfection; the world was absolutely a dry and thirsty land, where no water was but Jehovah's favour was better than life, and was His life practically through a world where all was felt, but felt with Jehovah realised Jehovah and His favour, the life of His soul, between Him and all.<a name=22:2></a> So the Christian, forsaken perhaps and imprisoned: "rejoice in the Lord alway, and, again I say rejoice," Nature has circumstances between itself and God; faith has God between the heart and circumstances.<a name=22:3></a> And what a difference!<a name=22:4></a>

		I may here remark a distinct characteristic of this psalm which comes into greater relief by the contrast of the one which follows.<a name=22:18></a> It touches on no circumstances, though it supposes them.<a name=22:19></a> It is divine life with God, and it knows and lives in the present consciousness of only Him.<a name=22:20></a> We find that there must have been death, hades, and the grave, but they are only mentioned as the occasion of the power and faithfulness of Jehovah.<a name=22:21></a> The psalm is man living through, with, and in view of God in this world, and so enjoying Him for ever in spite of death.<a name=22:22></a> Circumstances are but circumstances, and not the subject of the psalm.<a name=22:23></a> Divine life never passes away, "While we look not," says the apostle, "at the things that are seen, but at the things that are not seen; for the things that are seen are temporal, but the things that are not seen are eternal.<a name=22:24></a>" Such is the Christian expression of this.<a name=22:25></a> The former part of the phrase, which I do not cite, tells the effect of this as to circumstances, and is to be compared rather with the following psalm.<a name=22:26></a> The apostle beautifully expresses life itself in one word: "for to me to live is Christ; to die," no wonder, was "gain.<a name=22:27></a>" But it is important to remember, that there is an inward divine life which dwells and joys in God, having nothing to do with circumstances, though enabling us to go through them, and in us helped by them, because annulling the flesh and the will, so that we live more entirely of the inward life with God.<a name=22:28></a>

		In what follows we have the active expression of this life in reference to God.<a name=24:1></a> "I will bless Jehovah who giveth me counsel.<a name=24:2></a>" We need in divine life the positive instruction of wisdom -- counsel; wisdom, a divine clue and direction in the confusion of evil in this world; to be wise concerning that which is good; "not as fools, but as wise, redeeming the time -- not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is," Jehovah gives counsel.<a name=24:3></a> So if any man "lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not.<a name=24:4></a>" There is the immense privilege of the positive direction and guidance of God, the interest He feels in guiding the godly man aright, in the true path suited to God Himself, across the wilderness where there is no way.<a name=24:5></a> For innocence enjoying the blessings of God, there was no need of a way.<a name=24:6></a> In a world departed from God what way can be found?<a name=24:7></a> It would be to return, but this is impossible; no sinner ever returned to innocence.<a name=24:8></a> The way of the tree of life is shut up on that side; but how a way in a world without God?<a name=24:9></a> But God can make a way, if He gives a new life, with a new object to that life -- Himself as known in heaven -- if there is a new creation, and we are new created.<a name=24:10></a> Now Christ is a new life, and passes through the world, according to this life, to a new place given to man; and He does so as man, dependent man.<a name=24:11></a> God has prepared the path for man endowed with this life, and so for Christ, who was this life, and so the light of men.<a name=24:12></a> He has even prepared the special works suited to it: "good works which God hath before prepared that we should walk in them.<a name=24:13></a>" This last thought indeed goes somewhat beyond our psalm.<a name=24:14></a> It at any rate includes the activity of the divine nature in man, and is not limited to the right and holy path of man having this life before God, a thing as important in its place as the other.<a name=24:15></a> So Moses asks not, "Shew me <i>a</i> way across the desert," but "Shew me <i>thy</i> way, that I may know thee, and that I may find grace in thy sight.<a name=24:16></a>" What Moses sought, Jehovah gives the counsel and guidance of His love.<a name=24:17></a> So Christ walked; so He guides His sheep, going before them; and now we are led of the Spirit of God as ourselves sons of God.<a name=24:18></a> It is the divine path of wisdom which "the vulture's eye hath not seen": the path of man, but of man with the life of God, going towards the presence of God, and the incorruptible inheritance, in an uncorrupted way -- the path of God across the world; but God gives counsel for it.<a name=24:19></a> There is dependence on God for this, and Christ walked in it.<a name=24:20></a> "Thou shalt guide me by thy counsel," says even the remnant of Israel; as Jehovah in Psalm 32, "I will guide thee by mine eye.<a name=24:21></a>" I repeat, He is interested in the guidance of the man of God, and the soul blesses Him.<a name=24:22></a> In this path Christ trod.<a name=24:23></a> The written word is the great means of this; still there is the direct action of God in us by His Spirit.<a name=24:24></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, there is the testimony of creation, and in particular the heavens, for the earth has been given to man and is corrupt.<a name=36:2></a> Here, remark, God is spoken of, not Jehovah -- His hope in God as such.<a name=36:3></a> Hence the godly man sees that the witness goes out into all lands, and that the Gentiles are the objects of God's testimony.<a name=36:4></a> This is a very important point, which the Jews ought to have understood, and which Paul, by the Holy Ghost, did understand, citing this psalm to shew it -- not resting on what the testimony was, but on the fact that the testimony of God went out into all lands to the ends of the earth.<a name=36:5></a> The godly man can delight in this testimony to the glory of His God but he sees it reaches out to all.<a name=36:6></a> He enters into and understands the penetrating pervading character of this testimony, and that it is God who is witnessed to by it.<a name=36:7></a> Such, I add, will be the estimate of the restored remnant in the last days.<a name=36:8></a> See Psalm 148.<a name=36:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		37 But the godly man estimates the experimental excellence of the law of Jehovah also; and, though of course for Israel it was the law as given by Moses, we must take it here as the testimony of the word of God to the conscience.<a name=36:10></a> I say the conscience, because it is not the revelation of the riches of grace, or the unfolding of the Person of Christ and the ways of God in Him, but the testimony of God's word respecting man, to the conscience of man, even when it is taken in the largest sense.<a name=36:11></a> He does not say the law of God here, but "the law of Jehovah," a God known in covenant relationship.<a name=36:12></a> His law is given to His people, to His servants.<a name=36:13></a> It is perfect, the exact mind of God as to what man ought to be before God, according to God's will, now that evil is known; but man's mind is not such, even when the law of God is delighted in.<a name=36:14></a> It sets the soul therefore right.<a name=36:15></a> One has the consciousness of its doing so: for the soul, having life, appreciates it when revealed (though it may not have had it in mind), and is livingly susceptible of its truth.<a name=36:16></a> It has living power as the word of God for him who lives.<a name=36:17></a> But where it is not forgotten, there is enlightening and direction.<a name=36:18></a> It is pure and enlightens the eyes, gives to see clearly when we were obscure in heart and spirituality.<a name=36:19></a> But the psalm connects this with the state of the heart.<a name=36:20></a> There is a reference, not merely to the law, but to the Lord Himself -- the effect of the sense of God's presence in the conscience, the fear of the Lord -- the introduction of God into everything, and the reference of the heart to Him, and the judgment which He has of everything.<a name=36:21></a> This is clean; no spot can remain there, and it is an eternal principle, for it depends on the nature of God Himself.<a name=36:22></a> Further, God's dealing -- and ways as pronounced (for "judgments" include that, as well as judgments executed -- He does shew His judgment of things in His chastisements -- but in general every judgment He forms, however shewn) are true and righteous altogether.<a name=36:23></a> But they are not only this, but as gold, and the honeycomb to the faithful; they are the expressions of God's mind, and that is infinitely precious and sweet to the saints.<a name=36:24></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But, besides this, the heart is in the midst of dangers and human tendencies, which draw us far from God.<a name=36:25></a> The judgments of the Lord on all human conduct warn us: for the joy of the word, and, in the case of the Christian, of heaven, do not suffice.<a name=36:26></a> We need the wisdom and prudence which can point out a divine path in the confusion of evil, to guide our steps out of the reach of evil here.<a name=36:27></a> God's word meets us even here.<a name=36:28></a> And in keeping His judgments there is great reward, great positive blessing and peace of heart here.<a name=36:29></a> The soul is happy with God, and walks in peace through the world; and, as a Christian, the heart is thus wholly free to serve others.<a name=36:30></a>

		In what follows we have again the thoughts and feelings of the remnant in their sorrows, in connection with this place of Christ: but we shall find large instruction for our hearts in a path which is always one of sorrow, and essentially the same as long as evil reigns.<a name=48:1></a> In looking back to the psalms which we have studied, there is, I think, progress in their character.<a name=48:2></a> Thus, in the first psalms, from 3 to 7, we have the general principles and condition, shewing that righteousness does not yet reign by judgment (this is founded on the great foundations of Psalms 1 and 2): the righteous man in the midst of the wicked; judgment yet to come; and the counsels of God as to Messiah announced, but not yet fulfilled, in Psalm 8; in Psalms 9 and 10 the circumstances of the land and the Jews in the last days; and then, Psalms 11-15, the relationships, judgment, and principles of the remnant looking towards Jehovah in this state of things, Psalms 16-24 having given the whole position of Christ in respect of Israel, introducing Him amongst them, and shewing the result.<a name=48:3></a> We have now much more of the experimental exercises of the saints in that day.<a name=48:4></a> This we have now to consider.<a name=48:5></a> These could not but be founded on the intervention and sacrifice of Christ.<a name=48:6></a> It is not meant thereby that they are clear as to this, or that the expressions of the Psalms suppose it or suit a soul which is in liberty.<a name=48:7></a> But such exercises could not have place without His intervention and sacrifice; and the Holy Spirit, in the remnant, and in every soul, works in virtue of them, and with a view to their full recognition.<a name=48:8></a>

		In Psalm 25 we have, for the first time, the definite confession of sin.<a name=48:9></a> This, with Psalm 26, the declaration and consciousness of integrity of heart, form the subjective basis of all their experiences; the two following the objective -- Jehovah light and salvation, and present distress through the pressure of the wicked still here with confidence of heart in Jehovah.<a name=48:10></a> But the more we study the Psalms, the more we shall see that they apply properly to the Jews, and that almost universally; referring to the godly righteous man of the remnant, animated according to his position, whose thoughts are furnished by the Spirit of Christ speaking in the prophet.<a name=48:11></a> Many parts of them can be applied to Christ Himself, when all cannot.<a name=48:12></a> But this shews what I have already remarked, that the possibility of referring passages to Christ does not make them exclusively prophecies of Him, nor prove that all the psalm applies to Him; and, further, the real danger of taking the Psalms as the expression of Christian piety.<a name=48:13></a> They are not so.<a name=48:14></a> Often they furnish blessed instruction on confidence in God; but he who would take the form of his piety from the Psalms as a whole would falsify Christianity.<a name=48:15></a> Having said this, I turn to details.<a name=48:16></a>

		But there is progress in other respects in this psalm.<a name=50:19></a> It divides itself into three parts, 1-7; 8-14; 15-22.<a name=50:20></a> In the first part the oppressed and tried soul, judging its past sins, but trusting God and looking to Him, pleads with God in respect of its wants and difficulties in presence of the power of evil.<a name=50:21></a> In the second part this reference to God has led the soul to speak about Him, dwelling on and declaring what He is in His ways.<a name=50:22></a> In the third the soul looks personally to Jehovah, as assured of His interest in it, and calls down the eye of God on itself and on its enemies and circumstances, looking for forgiveness in that, but confiding in conscious integrity, and finally applies its request to all Israel.<a name=50:23></a>

		But there is also progress in detail, as to the condition of the soul in speaking of God.<a name=50:24></a> First, His goodness and uprightness lead Him to teach sinners uprightness in heart.<a name=50:25></a> They had wandered in their own ways; how terribly are God's ways forgotten!<a name=50:26></a> But the good and gracious Lord will not leave them unguided; their state draws out His compassion.<a name=50:27></a> He loves the right way, nor can He bless elsewhere.<a name=50:28></a> He teaches sinners in the way.<a name=50:29></a> But the effect of acknowledging sin and knowing the goodness of God is meekness, subduedness of spirit, and lowliness; the absence of haughtiness, of self, of what the heathens considered the spring of virtue.<a name=50:30></a> In this state God guides in judgment and teaches His way.<a name=50:31></a> Not only the way is taught to one who had wandered far from it; but, where there is lowliness and submission to God, He guides in the intelligence of His ways in their own spirit and mind.<a name=50:32></a> They are formed by His instructions to judge of what God's own way is.<a name=50:33></a> This is an internal and moral conformity which applies itself to discern and judge circumstances.<a name=50:34></a> And this moral conformity and discernment is very precious.<a name=50:35></a>

		In Psalm 26 it is, as already remarked, the consciousness of integrity rather than the confession of sins, but here, also, all refers to Jehovah, and draws from what Jehovah is and the attachment of the soul to Him the principle of separation from evil-doers, and final joy in His congregation when there shall be full deliverance from them.<a name=52:15></a> The spirit of the psalm is that integrity which has kept the soul by its own affections, and its attachment to Jehovah, and trust in Jehovah in presence of the power of evil (and for the time, as between them and the saints, evil-doers are always the most powerful, because they can act according to their will without restraint or conscience), apart from evildoers; and the conscience in presence of Jehovah looks to God's (not gathering it with sinners), when He comes in power, and on this it counts in faith.<a name=52:16></a> It is the expression of the path and desire of integrity in presence of evil.<a name=52:17></a>

		The great truth of Psalm 30 is the practically deeply interesting one, that the joy flowing from the deliverance the Lord (in this psalm Jehovah) affords is greater and deeper than the blessing of prosperity, even when acknowledged to come from God.<a name=57:16></a> It may be that the deliverance is from sorrow occasioned by faults.<a name=57:17></a> With the remnant of the Jews it will surely be so; but it is complete and full; and when the sin or evil is fully acknowledged, the restoration and blessing is absolute in communion with God.<a name=57:18></a> Forgiveness, or the thought of it, in an unhealed soul, may have regrets.<a name=57:19></a> When the soul is healed, it will learn judgment of the evil assuredly, and a sense of humbleness, if it be recurred to -- always more tenderness of spirit, more grace; but if the healing be full, the soul wholly searched out, no regrets, because what God, as such, is for us, will possess the soul.<a name=57:20></a> The soul will abhor the flesh, and the principles which led to evil; but self will be taken out of the abhorrence when the evil is really hated, and peace will be there.<a name=57:21></a> I do not say the psalm pursues these thoughts to this depth.<a name=57:22></a> It is more occupied with the outward circumstances, with the hand of God upon it for evil, than with the evil for which His hand is upon it.<a name=57:23></a> But these are looked at as His anger.<a name=57:24></a> The effect is that circumstances are looked at as a matter of His anger and favour; and on this the soul rests.<a name=57:25></a> It had been in prosperity, had owned its coming from God, but saw in circumstances its ground of confidence for happiness, though looked at as given and established by God.<a name=57:26></a> But, in so doing, however much it owned God in giving and assuring the blessing, it rested on the blessing, and that blessing ministered to self, instead of taking out of it.<a name=57:27></a> "I shall never be moved.<a name=57:28></a> Jehovah, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong.<a name=57:29></a>" Though piety might be there, it might degenerate into "the temple of Jehovah, the temple of Jehovah are these.<a name=57:30></a>" The psalm however supposes true piety.<a name=57:31></a> Only that God's favour has made the mountain -- "<i>my mountain</i>" -- to stand strong, instead of the favour itself being the blessing.<a name=57:32></a> Jehovah hides His face, and direct dependence is felt, direct blessing looked for.<a name=57:33></a> Chastening and exercises for faults come, and divine favour itself is felt to be the blessing needed.<a name=57:34></a> And what Jehovah is Himself is the source of joy.<a name=57:35></a> When His anger is on the people, this is felt; not merely the circumstances it is expressed in, but the hiding of Jehovah's face for sin.<a name=57:36></a> The soul is brought into an immediate relationship, though it is by anguish and distress.<a name=57:37></a> It is brought to think of itself, not as a self to be caressed, a centre of its own blessing, but as sinful, and God's favour is needed.<a name=57:38></a> Thus, though painfully, a most useful and important work is done through grace, when this self-judgment is wrought in the soul, so that there is spiritual integrity.<a name=57:39></a> The favour of Jehovah shines in upon it, and is enjoyed, and is become itself the blessing, while positive deliverance accompanies it in God's good time.<a name=57:40></a> The true nature of God in holy worship is entered into; He is not merely a God to serve man in blessing.<a name=57:41></a> The enemy does not rejoice over us, and the soul itself is healed.<a name=57:42></a> We see that if His anger be there, it is but a moment of discipline and instruction for the saints; and then they, being purified, enjoy Himself more fully.<a name=57:43></a> Here, literally, we see the remnant at the verge of the grave, and there delivered; but the true work is, even for them, with God.<a name=57:44></a>

		I add these conditions of soul in which we may see saints now, of which this psalm gives an occasion to speak.<a name=59:1></a> First, what we may call in a comparative sense innocence, when a converted soul has no acquaintance with corruption and no great inward conflict.<a name=59:2></a> Here the grace of forgiveness is enjoyed, and the soul is cheerfully happy in the known kindness and love of God its Saviour.<a name=59:3></a> Such a soul, if walking close with God, may attain to the real judgment of self and deep acquaintance with God.<a name=59:4></a> Otherwise the soul is superficial, and the man of self little known, separation from flesh's sphere (the world on its amiable side) little realised.<a name=59:5></a> The next is where it has failed, and, gone through deeper exercises, has been brought thus to the knowledge of self in a humbling way.<a name=59:6></a> This is more the case of the psalm.<a name=59:7></a> Then forgiveness may be known, and there is the rest of this; but a certain shame of sin and want of open confidence with God, as naturally in enjoyment of Him, if there have been anything base or trifling with God.<a name=59:8></a> This is more difficult to attain; but self at any rate is not set aside.<a name=59:9></a> Thirdly, when the root that has produced the evil is really judged, the point of departure from God (not merely the evil itself), and self thus set aside practically, then divine favour is everything.<a name=59:10></a> The heart is so far whole with God, and, while humble, bold with men.<a name=59:11></a> It has its conscious link with God, His favour -- God known to be with it in moral unison, and in positive sustainment and strength.<a name=59:12></a> The present is its place with Him, not the past.<a name=59:13></a>

		Psalm 31 is the expression of entire confidence in Jehovah -- God known in our relationship with Him, in the most terrible circumstances of trial and distress, and that where sin has brought it on; yet where faith is at work, the known name of God is counted on, and therefore His righteousness in making it good.<a name=59:14></a> It is not reckoning upon God with pride.<a name=59:15></a> It is Jehovah trusted in for what He is -- His name, but with the fullest confession of failure, and that it is through sin that trouble has come upon him that cries to Him.<a name=59:16></a> It is not so much the confession of iniquity, but that the sorrow out of which the cry is sent up is due to iniquity; but the extremity of pressure casts the soul in confidence on God according to His revelation of Himself.<a name=59:17></a> The special character of the psalm is trust, and, from personal knowledge of Jehovah, the committing one's case to Him.<a name=59:18></a> This is a deep principle of true piety -- such a knowledge of the Lord, such faith in what He is, that the soul can trust Him, and cast all on Him, when distress and hostility come to an extremity.<a name=59:19></a> And it is a principle of utter righteousness, because the soul cannot look thus to God but in righteousness.<a name=59:20></a> Jehovah is known as having considered the distressed one's trouble.<a name=59:21></a> He has known his soul in adversities.<a name=59:22></a> The sufferings were not God's forgetting the sufferer.<a name=59:23></a> God has known, recognised, followed; His heart owned the sufferer's soul, and thought of it in the midst of adversities; and the sufferer, as an owned soul (however faulty), looks through the suffering to Jehovah.<a name=59:24></a> It accepts the punishment of its iniquity, but in this righteous feeling trusts Jehovah; and in this spirit, in what is perfect in principle, commits itself entirely to Jehovah, and knows, and is content that it should be so, that all is in His hand (verse 15).<a name=59:25></a> It looks hence for His face to shine on it; but that through His appearing for it, it should not be finally ashamed, nor will any that trust in Him.<a name=59:26></a> He has laid up goodness for them that fear Him and trust in Him before the sons of men.<a name=59:27></a> His presence is a sure unfailing sanctuary, which makes human malice vain in its attempts.<a name=59:28></a> He admits that, in the pressure of distress, he had for a moment spoken as cast out of God.<a name=59:29></a> Still faith was shewn in the cry to Jehovah, and he was heard.<a name=59:30></a> Jehovah preserves the faithful, so that the saints may love Him, and be of good courage, whatever comes.<a name=59:31></a>

		But there is another principle brought out here -- what the walk is in which this blessing is found; verse 7-10.<a name=67:1></a> We have fearing the Lord, trusting the Lord, and seeking the Lord.<a name=67:2></a> Verses 11-16 take up what the character of this fear of the Lord is, in a passage most of which is quoted by Peter only.<a name=67:3></a> The end of verse 16 is left out as inapplicable now, though the general fact of government for the Christian is not.<a name=67:4></a> It is important that we should remember this.<a name=67:5></a> Not only is it true that God is not mocked -- that what a man sows he will reap -- that God has governmentally attached certain consequences to certain conduct; but He also watches over and directly governs His children -- may cause them to be sick, to die; may deliver them from it, on confession or intercession.<a name=67:6></a> "The eyes of Jehovah are upon the righteous, his ears open to their cry.<a name=67:7></a>" Not only that, but "nigh to them that are of broken heart, and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.<a name=67:8></a>" Then there is a path marked out by God as the path of peace in a world like this; not simply in itself the path of spiritual power, but of quietness and peace in this world, going peaceably through it under God's eye.<a name=67:9></a> And that is very precious for us.<a name=67:10></a> Grace is a means of doing it, as the heart is elsewhere than in idleness and passion.<a name=67:11></a> The feet are shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace.<a name=67:12></a> As far as in us lies, we live peaceably with all men.<a name=67:13></a> This is true even of unconverted men.<a name=67:14></a> Those who walk in this way in general see good days, because such is the consequence of the public government of God.<a name=67:15></a> It becomes the Christian so to do, but others may do it.<a name=67:16></a> This government of God is always true, as we see in Job; only the saint should understand it.<a name=67:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is yet a word which remains.<a name=67:18></a> This government is not such now as that the righteous should not suffer (compare 1 Peter 3: 14-17), still more for the name of Christ.<a name=67:19></a> But Jehovah watches over him.<a name=67:20></a> Not a sparrow falls to the ground without our Father.<a name=67:21></a> It seems strange to us to hear, "Some of you shall they cause to be put to death .<a name=67:22></a>.<a name=67:23></a>.<a name=67:24></a> but there shall not a hair of your head perish.<a name=67:25></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		But the government of God now is applied -- not the public government to the suppression of all evil but -- to the case of the righteous under and through the power of evil.<a name=67:26></a> When Christ appears, there will be this suppression of evil.<a name=67:27></a> In general they who live peaceably will live in peace but in a world where Satan's power is, the righteous will suffer -- have many afflictions, but none without the watchful care of the Lord.<a name=67:28></a> And in some way deliverance will come.<a name=67:29></a> Who would have said that, in the seemingly unbridled rage of men, when all (Jew, priests, or Gentile) were united against Christ -- when to appearance they had all their own way, this psalm should be literally fulfilled in Christ?<a name=67:30></a> Not a hair of our head but is counted.<a name=67:31></a>

		I doubt that this verse 20 in the psalm is exactly a prophecy, though literally accomplished in Christ.<a name=68:1></a> I should rather suppose that the passage in John's Gospel referred to Exodus 12: 46.<a name=68:2></a> But Christ is a perfect example in any case of the declaration made in the psalm, as a great general principle, if the passage be not cited.<a name=68:3></a> God's care never fails, and is shewn in the smallest circumstances, and in spite of all man's thoughts, though God may allow many afflictions to come upon those that trust Him.<a name=68:4></a> These too will surely be a blessing.<a name=68:5></a> The soul, thus learning the Lord's ways and trusting Him, can bless Him at all times.<a name=68:6></a> Christianity indeed can teach us deeper fruits of spiritual life in this respect.<a name=68:7></a> But it is precious to know the Lord as one that watches thus over us in love -- a Father's tender care, in which we can confide, and in which we can walk peaceably in this world, seeking the good of those around us.<a name=68:8></a>

		Psalm 35 is the direct demand for judgment of the Spirit of Christ in the remnant, so that I have not much to remark upon it.<a name=68:9></a> But Himself was the first to suffer what here will be judged, but, as we have seen, never personally looks for judgment.<a name=68:10></a> Still this psalm shews us the spirit in which judgment is demanded, It was after patience and unwearied grace, and when this grace was of no avail, when there was no self-avenging, but casting themselves on the Lord, that at the end the Lord is looked to for deliverance.<a name=68:11></a> This is important to remark, as regards the judgment looked for.<a name=68:12></a> (See verses 12-14.<a name=68:13></a>) And it was only when he would be swallowed up that he looks to the Lord Himself to interfere, and so He will.<a name=68:14></a> The poor will not always be forgotten, nor is it right that heartless, unjust, and cruel evil should always have the upper hand unhindered.<a name=68:15></a> It is right that the saints should be patient -- bear all till the Lord Himself interferes; and such is the spirit of this Psalm, and then it rejoices in the Lord's salvation.<a name=68:16></a> There is a righteous feeling that the Lord's recompensing the cruel wickedness is right, and so it is.<a name=68:17></a> Besides this, what we have is the character and way of the wicked, and the preceding entirely gracious walk of him who found the wicked too strong for him.<a name=68:18></a>

		Verses 26, 27 have a special application to Christ, but the whole psalm, in the mouth of any one forward in faithfulness, was to bring the tide of evil on himself.<a name=69:1></a> I would refer to one or two passages to shew the working of this spirit, and how far the Lord points to it as to the remnant.<a name=69:2></a> As to Himself, save to prophesy the fact, He did not ask for it.<a name=69:3></a> He never does.<a name=69:4></a> See 1 Samuel 24, 25, 26, for the spirit in which David was kept, though weak, yet still then the instrument specially fitted by grace to attune the mind of Christ in these psalms to the circumstances in which the remnant, cast out like him, will be; and rising up, when God pleased, to the prophetic declaration of what Christ Himself should pass through, and provide words, wonderful honour!<a name=69:5></a> in which Christ could express Himself (see particularly chapter 24: 11-13, and the end of chapter 26), for so many of the psalms.<a name=69:6></a> So Abigail keeps him in this spirit through mercy, but there is no self-avenging but casting himself on the Lord.<a name=69:7></a>

		The way in which the Lord directs His disciples in Matthew 10 marks the spirit, too, in which the remnant are to bear witness for His commission, and goes on to His return; verse 13-15.<a name=69:8></a> Compare Psalm 35: 13.<a name=69:9></a> It is important that the Christian should understand that while the Spirit of Christ in His own walk in the world was quite different, and so ought the Christian's to be, from the desire of judgment expressed in the psalms, yet that the desire is righteous and right in its place, and that that desire of judgment is not self-vengeance, but an appeal to a delivering and righteous God after the perfect patience of the heart under unrighteous oppression, as bowing to the will of God, and learning the lesson He had to teach.<a name=69:10></a> Compare Psalm 94: 12, and following.<a name=69:11></a> Still the Christian is on quite different ground.<a name=69:12></a> In this point of view this psalm is an important one.<a name=69:13></a> It is one in which the spirit of the remnant is exercised before God by trial, and, inwardly subdued, is cast upon God to look for deliverance, according to the way in which it was promised to Israel and to the remnant under the divine government revealed in the law and the prophets.<a name=69:14></a>

		Psalm 36, while spoken in connection with what is a very great trial, is yet, and indeed for that very reason, full of very deep comfort.<a name=70:1></a> The trial is this, that the ways of the wicked prove to the heart of the servant of God that there is no restraint of conscience, nothing to reckon on in them, no check to malice by the fear of God.<a name=70:2></a> Flattering himself in his own sight, he is devising mischief, he has no abhorrence of evil.<a name=70:3></a> How often does this, alas!<a name=70:4></a> come before the saint when in conflict with the power of the enemy.<a name=70:5></a> It is hard to believe this absence of conscience and planning mischief in malice reflected or advisedly; yet so it is.<a name=70:6></a> The heart knows it is true.<a name=70:7></a> The word points it out as characteristic.<a name=70:8></a> But then the consolation is very great and blessed, while it casts the soul entirely on a faithful and all-gracious God, who is above all schemes of man, so that we can be perfectly peaceful.<a name=70:9></a> "Thy mercy, O Jehovah, is in the heavens.<a name=70:10></a>" What can malice do then?<a name=70:11></a> Its schemes cannot reach there, nor frustrate the plans or government which are established there, nor come between the soul and their effect.<a name=70:12></a> Mercy is out of the reach of the wicked's devices.<a name=70:13></a>

		The psalm continues, "With thee is the fountain of life, and in thy light shall we see light.<a name=71:11></a>" Up to this it has spoken rather of what God is for us, looked at as shelter, and protection, and comfort -- in a word, a resource; but having brought us into the fatness of His house and the rivers of His pleasures, it refers to what God is more intrinsically in Himself in blessing; still more as what He is for us than in us -- that belongs by the Holy Ghost to Christians.<a name=71:12></a> What is in us is here seen in Him as its source.<a name=71:13></a> "With thee is," says the psalm; "it shall be in him," says the Lord, of the Christian.<a name=71:14></a> God is that, however, and so revealed here and known.<a name=71:15></a> With Him is the fountain of life -- a word of great import, though never fully revealed till Christ came.<a name=71:16></a> In Him was life.<a name=71:17></a> There was a tree of life of which man never ate, an instrumental ordinance of man's life.<a name=71:18></a> In the patriarchal times life is not the subject.<a name=71:19></a>, but what the Almighty is to His beloved and blessed ones.<a name=71:20></a> The law connects life as a promise with man's doing, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.<a name=71:21></a> It was to be one.<a name=71:22></a> Life is a living connection with the source of blessing, or at least a living enjoyment of His favour -- not necessarily heaven.<a name=71:23></a> No law could give it or was it.<a name=71:24></a> God promised it to him who kept the law.<a name=71:25></a> God is the fountain of it, but the law given to a sinner on the principle of his responsibility could be no means of life, but a ministry of death and condemnation.<a name=71:26></a> It spoke of life -- was with life in view, as promise on obedience, but in fact was found to be unto death.<a name=71:27></a> The psalms are where, though heavenly things are spoken of, the connection of the heart of the remnant with God is brought out, and all its throbs and beating in its need, and what God is for it are felt; and that according to the working of the Spirit of Christ, though temporal deliverances are, as for the remnant, the main desire.<a name=71:28></a> Life and resurrection as the hope of faith necessarily come in, though it be but in the depth of their most intimate thoughts; and they will meet the need of those who may be slain.<a name=71:29></a> It is not life and incorruptibility brought to light by the gospel; life in a Man, the Son of God, a quickening Spirit; life in us by His becoming our life.<a name=71:30></a> Still as Christ's Spirit speaks in the psalms, He who had life was sure of the path of it in this world; and, as it led through death in the purpose for which He came into this world, sure of the resurrection too, that His soul would not be left in hades nor His flesh see corruption, but here in dependence on God as being man.<a name=71:31></a>

		Psalm 37 is very distinctly in connection with the display of the direct government of God in this world, as it will be made good when the meek shall inherit the land and the wicked be cut off.<a name=75:4></a> We have already seen that the epistles of Peter especially furnish to us the application of this to the Christian estate as far as it is so applicable.<a name=75:5></a> The beginning of Matthew 5 gives us also, only with a much fuller evangelical character, though not going farther than the kingdom of heaven, the application in the way of promise, as far as the temper pleasing to God goes.<a name=75:6></a> But there are some most interesting and instructive exhortations in the psalm as to the spirit in which the believer is to walk and the character of his confidence in God in the midst of the evil which surrounds him.<a name=75:7></a> For though the time of the direct display of God's government be not come, and no doubt the power of evil will be displayed more oppressively just before it is put down, still it is even now the time of patience, and the evil is there.<a name=75:8></a> Till Christ comes, it is in principle the evil day, and the patience and kingdom of Jesus Christ go together in the heart -- not His own kingdom and glory.<a name=75:9></a> They are all founded on the certainty that after all Jehovah is above all the evil, loves judgment, does not forget the righteous and those who trust in Him, and that, in the end, His way would have the upper hand.<a name=75:10></a> Meanwhile faith is exercised and all that is in the heart judged, which would by self-will mar the spiritual character and hinder the confidence in the Lord which becomes the saint.<a name=75:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first exhortation is to peacefulness of spirit, and it is general and applies to the state of the mind.<a name=75:12></a> "Fret not thyself.<a name=75:13></a>" When self-will and the desire of present satisfaction mingles itself with the love of righteousness, when one desires righteousness (and partly sometimes, through fear of the power of evil), and is selfish through peace-loving interests, one is apt to fret oneself because evil has its way.<a name=75:14></a> All this is the same spirit of unbelief with other desires.<a name=75:15></a> But it is unbelief and self-will.<a name=75:16></a> The wrath of man does not work the righteousness of God.<a name=75:17></a> We are neither to fret, which is distrust, nor be envious, which is even worse and self-interest.<a name=75:18></a> Then comes the positive direction in what spirit we are to walk.<a name=75:19></a> What is the resource against the power of evil?<a name=75:20></a> "Trust in Jehovah and do good.<a name=75:21></a>" You will reap the fruit of it according to promise.<a name=75:22></a>

		Psalm 38 presents to us a special state of soul.<a name=78:1></a> The relationship of the heart with God is known and felt, and that even in confidence, as the soul pursues the expression of its feelings.<a name=78:2></a> "In thee, O Jehovah, do I hope.<a name=78:3></a> Thou wilt hear, O Jehovah my God.<a name=78:4></a>" Yet the soul is in the depth of sorrow and distress, and this looked at as the chastening of the Lord.<a name=78:5></a> It is under it, but deprecates it; that is, being in profound distress and sorrow, in loathsome disease, and friends abandoning, and enemies lively (as Job's state partially), Jehovah is looked to in it.<a name=78:6></a> The heart attributes it all to sin, but first of all looks to Jehovah and His hand.<a name=78:7></a> It is this that shews faith and a right mind.<a name=78:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The order of thought is thus remarkable: first, Jehovah judging, then sin as the cause, then personal misery, then abandonment of friends, then liveliness and ill-will of enemies, and the consciousness of all resulting in the heart confiding in Him that smote, turning to Him that smiteth it; and then comes out what at bottom was in the heart -- hope in Jehovah, the consciousness of such belonging to Him as that the triumph of faith's enemies could not be, and that in the sense of the need of His intervention, because the poor sinning soul had no strength in self.<a name=78:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All this leads to the expression of unfeigned integrity of heart; acknowledgment of sin, not merely owning it to be the cause of judgment, but judging self for it before a trusted Jehovah, and thus able freely to look for help from Him.<a name=78:10></a> The soul, in disengaging sin from itself through grace, in judging it, can disengage, so to speak, its enemies from the pressing judgments of Jehovah; and, seeing them only in their own malice and hostility to the servant of Jehovah and to what was right, can now look for Jehovah's help against them.<a name=78:11></a> For the believer, though he had grievously sinned and been brought righteously low for it, yet really followed what was good.<a name=78:12></a> And though Jehovah used the malice of the wicked as a rod, it was not the evil which the wicked hated in the saints, but their connection with and owning the Lord.<a name=78:13></a> Yet the judgment was righteous.<a name=78:14></a> This will be the true history of the remnant when, under the terrible chastisement of Jehovah, they earnestly turn to what is right.<a name=78:15></a> But what an instruction also for us when under chastisement for what is wrong!<a name=78:16></a> Perhaps complicated chastisement for an extreme case is supposed here.<a name=78:17></a>

		In verses 9, 10, we have the perfectness of His service.<a name=84:10></a> He has preached righteousness before the whole people of Israel; He has not shrunk from it, nor hid it within His heart: a lesson to all of us, though to be used with divine guidance.<a name=84:11></a> It was God's righteousness, His ways, nature, judgments, judgment of evil, what He was in judging it, His faithfulness too, and salvation -- for Jehovah was this to Israel -- His lovingkindness and truth.<a name=84:12></a> He had preached righteousness to man, and that perfectly; and he had fully declared what Jehovah was in all the perfectness of His nature and character towards Israel.<a name=84:13></a> All this was accomplished.<a name=84:14></a> He appeals to its full accomplishment.<a name=84:15></a> But now, He who had freely undertaken this service for God's glory towards Israel finds Himself in another position.<a name=84:16></a> It has brought the hatred of the nation upon Him, the wishers of evil against Him.<a name=84:17></a>

		SECOND BOOK -- PSALM 42-72
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the early part of this second book of the Psalms there is an element which gives a very distinct character to its spiritual as well as its prophetical import -- the absence of the covenant name of God (the transition to Jehovah is in Psalm 46).<a name=86:1></a> Whatever the distresses and sorrows of the first forty -- one psalms, the heart of the psalmist always looked freely to Jehovah in them, was in fuller relationship with Him and the enjoyment of public services, in which His name was celebrated.<a name=86:2></a> Here he is cast out.<a name=86:3></a> He remembers these things.<a name=86:4></a> He is an outcast and can only, in the secret of his soul and in wilderness circumstances, look to the nature and essence of what God is.<a name=86:5></a> We have still to remember the difference of the nature of relationship of Jehovah and the Father, and the looking for outward deliverance and judgment in order to have that deliverance.<a name=86:6></a> Still this change will furnish deep religious instruction.<a name=86:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Psalm 22 furnishes us with the expression of this difference in the strongest way.<a name=86:8></a> There Christ Himself was out of the enjoyment of His own relationship with the Father, having been made sin for us.<a name=86:9></a> In human sorrows He for once does not find divine comfort.<a name=86:10></a> Now as to present wrath, no godly soul of course ever goes through this; but as to sorrow, God's face is hid from Israel, and when they are awakened they feel that it is because of sin, and this though faith is at work, which is just what these psalms describe.<a name=86:11></a> It is faith looking at God when all circumstances are against him who exercises it, and they are driven out from the present enjoyment of revealed communion and covenant relationship; it is the position God sets His people in when covenant relationship is broken as it will be, and is -- with Israel, or not known: and faith, acknowledging the justice of this, looks through all to God's own faithfulness as such.<a name=86:12></a> It is, so to speak, naked faith, without anything to sustain it of what God gives to His people as the witness of conferred favours.<a name=86:13></a> The result is a full trial of the soul.<a name=86:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The question for the soul here is not how far it is enjoying His gifts, but, how far its state can link itself with what God is in Himself, and count on that.<a name=86:15></a> This probes it to the bottom because all flesh is completely judged; for it can have no connection with God at all.<a name=86:16></a> It is true that this is never understood but by a new nature -- that nature which can understand what God is, and, through grace and the working of the Holy Spirit, cleave to promises.<a name=86:17></a> But the flesh is thereby fully judged, and the difference of that and the new man known and discerned, yet redemption is not known.<a name=86:18></a> Because of this new nature there is the consciousness of the desire to do good, and of God's favour, but no peace.<a name=86:19></a> It is a searching process that we may be cast in naked dependence on grace.<a name=86:20></a> It is practically as to principle Romans 7.<a name=86:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=87>[Page 87]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In speaking of Psalm 42, we can only take the great principle, unless in a very special case of Christian experience; because the psalm supposes the person's enjoyment of common blessings, he remembered them.<a name=87:1></a> The special case is this: when a soul has believed in forgiveness, owning, no doubt, its sinfulness, but not really searched out, or the entirely sinful nature of the flesh discovered, the first joy may be lost, and the soul only know enough of God to feel the dreadfulness of not having the light of His countenance; but this gives the earnest desire to enjoy it.<a name=87:2></a> It may also happen when a soul has supposed itself Christian, but finds out, through the operation of God's Spirit, that it is not.<a name=87:3></a> In either case, the true blessed effect of the position in which we are placed by redemption is not known.<a name=87:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The psalm goes no farther than hope, but it is a hope much deepened and made more true by the trial.<a name=87:5></a> It expresses more the result of the trial than the process; and hence it is we have so blessed an expression of the state of the soul, however forlorn it is.<a name=87:6></a> It thirsts after God Himself -- the difference of the Christian state is that, as in Romans 5, he joys in God.<a name=87:7></a> Still this state of thirsting is in certain respects deeper than the first joy, because the joy is partial in its realisation: the want is complete, and God Himself, in Himself, the thing desired.<a name=87:8></a> No doubt the psalm refers to the circumstances, and it is the soul's loss of God, in happy circumstances which supported the soul more or less, which obliges it to lean on and look for God Himself more absolutely, and, as we shall see, draws its joy thence.<a name=87:9></a> And it is this the spiritual soul has to look to in this psalm.<a name=87:10></a> His soul is athirst for God.<a name=87:11></a> He had lost the joy of the multitude, but he now panted after God Himself, where there was none of this.<a name=87:12></a> The change was sensible; but what he felt the loss of for his heart was God Himself.<a name=87:13></a> This was what he panted after.<a name=87:14></a> People and happy circumstances disappear from the mind as from the scene, though they were enjoyed with God.<a name=87:15></a> The individual heart wants God for itself.<a name=87:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The divine nature in us craves after its delight in God, the objective fulness that satisfies it, because it is the divine nature.<a name=87:17></a> Its thirst is perfect after that -- that one great blessed object, which fills all the desires and excludes every other.<a name=87:18></a> Previously the soul had enjoyed the blessings from God and God Himself in <i>them</i>.<a name=87:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=88>[Page 88]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now God Himself becomes consciously and necessarily the whole blessing itself.<a name=88:1></a> The trial has judged all flesh as to the subjective state of the soul, all mediate enjoyment of God in circumstances; and the divine life, in order to its full blessing and consciousness of what that blessing is, has its perfect delight in God only and God Himself.<a name=88:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is a wonderfully deepening process.<a name=88:3></a> It is not that the soul will not have joy, but that the source of joy, pure moral blessing, has a much fuller place in the heart, and, as we shall see, henceforth characterises it.<a name=88:4></a> Hence it is that we see persons who have been deeply tried by the loss of blessings, which in their place were given of God, far more calm, possessed of a deeper consciousness of God being their portion, and hence more withdrawn from the influence of circumstances to that blessed centre of rest.<a name=88:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The enemy, though in a painful way -- and so is it even in God's discipline -- contributes to the furtherance of the soul in this path.<a name=88:6></a> They said, Where is thy God?<a name=88:7></a> They have driven them out from the public enjoyment of conferred -- and in Israel covenant -- blessing.<a name=88:8></a> (So Job.<a name=88:9></a>) And where was the sign of their having blessings from Him?<a name=88:10></a> But as they had ascribed it to God and proclaimed His faithfulness and power to secure, they taunt them with it now and say, What can you say now?<a name=88:11></a> Where is thy God?<a name=88:12></a> This, really, the unhappy Jews did to Christ.<a name=88:13></a> But this only casts the soul on Him.<a name=88:14></a> There was nothing for it, but what God was Himself The enemy had driven them away from all else -- from mercies which by abuse tended to shut God out.<a name=88:15></a> These the enemy succeeded in depriving the soul of, and left it only God.<a name=88:16></a> And the soul hoped in Him; but what was the consequence?<a name=88:17></a> Crying out for the blessing?<a name=88:18></a> No.<a name=88:19></a> Often the soul, by seeking joy, cannot get it, this would not purify and bless it: and to bless God must purify.<a name=88:20></a> When emptied of self and seeking God, we find joy.<a name=88:21></a> So here, while remembering the past joy, he says, I shall yet praise Him for the help of His countenance.<a name=88:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But some other traits must be noticed here.<a name=88:23></a> Pride and stoical resistance to sorrow will not do.<a name=88:24></a> That does not draw the soul to God, but effectually and specially keeps it from Him -- teaches it, or pretends to teach it, to do without Him, as the Stoics held in fact that the virtuous man was God's equal.<a name=88:25></a> Here the soul had felt the sorrow and was dependent, and now can be open with God, because of His goodness and faithfulness.<a name=88:26></a> Sorrow, when it is complete and helpless, gives intimacy with him who is willing and able to help, and this is now with God.<a name=88:27></a> He tells his sorrow to God (verse 5).<a name=88:28></a> He reasoned with himself.<a name=88:29></a> How he says, "O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore will I remember <i>thee</i>.<a name=88:30></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=89>[Page 89]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But this leads to another point.<a name=89:1></a> The troubles themselves come from God.<a name=89:2></a> Inward self-judgment and looking to God bring Him and Him alone into everything.<a name=89:3></a> Enemies have disappeared, with blessings.<a name=89:4></a> "<i>Thy</i> waves and <i>thy</i> billows are gone over me.<a name=89:5></a>" God began the matter with Job and told neither Satan nor Job what He was about, and uses Satan's blind malice to break Job's unsubdued, and of himself unsuspected, nature, and to bring about a blessing.<a name=89:6></a> Deep called to deep, but it was at the voice of God's waterspouts.<a name=89:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But this seeing God's hand in purpose leads to the consciousness of covenant relationship; to us of Father, here of Jehovah; and He is reckoned upon according to that for the future.<a name=89:8></a> "Jehovah will command his loving-kindness in the day-time, and in the night shall his song be with me, and my prayer unto the God of my life.<a name=89:9></a>" Confidence is thus acquired -- boldness with a faithful God.<a name=89:10></a> "I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me?<a name=89:11></a>" He does not say "forsaken" here.<a name=89:12></a> That Christ alone was, and faith knows it never can be.<a name=89:13></a> But because of this confidence in the unfailing love of God, he asks Him who is his rock why He has left him in the power of the enemy.<a name=89:14></a> Note how, when once we see the hand of God in our sorrows, we can look for deliverance, because it is God, and His hand is on us in love.<a name=89:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And now the reproach of the enemies becomes a plea with God; for when they say, Where is thy God?<a name=89:16></a> the only answer is, God's manifesting Himself.<a name=89:17></a> Meanwhile the soul has been deepened in its desires after God Himself.<a name=89:18></a> All carelessness of heart removed, so that manifestation has infinitely more value.<a name=89:19></a> Here the assurances of blessing are enlarged, before the distressed soul has said that he was assured of the help of His countenance as the theme of his praises; but we have seen that his heart, purified and exercised, had been drawn up into confiding in the sure faithfulness of God in known relationship.<a name=89:20></a> The heart, though not yet outwardly freed, is fixed on God in desire and in confidence.<a name=89:21></a> Hence he says now, Who is the health of my countenance -- his countenance reflects in joy the outshining of God's in love -- and my God.<a name=89:22></a> Distress and the deprivation of all given, even religious, blessings, had cast the heart upon God and drawn it to look to Him as the alone source of joy, and with the confidence which must spring up when the soul is near God, known in His own relationship by faith.<a name=89:23></a> It cannot be otherwise.<a name=89:24></a> There may be delay as to full peace of heart and enjoyment, if the Lord sees purifying and sifting still necessary; but there will be a confiding leaning on Him, and the soul then is brought to thirst evidently for Himself.<a name=89:25></a> "My soul is athirst for God.<a name=89:26></a>" It addresses itself to God, but it is the soul panting after Him.<a name=89:27></a> We do not get the answer here, but the state of the soul looking purely for God Himself, brought to do it, and assured of the shining of the light of His countenance and of the joy and health it would give.<a name=89:28></a> Remark as to the detail that it is when the soul has been broken down and its force of pride has given way, that it then remembers God; verse 6.<a name=89:29></a> So when God's hand is seen in his trials (verse 7), he sees that Jehovah, God as known in relationship, will command His lovingkindness, and God is the God of his life and God his rock.<a name=89:30></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Psalm 43.<a name=90:1></a> In Psalm 42 we have seen the soul internally restored and animated to an earnest thirsting after God Himself, seeking all its joy in Himself Being brought to that, in Psalm 43, it is looking out for a deliverance, which shall enable it to enjoy God freely and fully.<a name=90:2></a> God has become, for the heart, its exceeding joy; and it will be recalled, thus restored, to free worship of Him, to express its joy and thanksgiving fully.<a name=90:3></a> God is not here characterised as the living God, but as the God of his strength.<a name=90:4></a> Till the soul was fully fixed on God Himself as its delight, this cry for deliverance, though natural and not wrong, if subject to Ms will (yet it would rather desire purification than escape from affliction), was yet more a reference to comfort and ease; though from the hand of God this is not to be slighted.<a name=90:5></a> But now it is identified with the desire to praise and glorify God.<a name=90:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This change has to be noted: when under trial, righteously and graciously from God, perhaps unrighteously from man, the heart naturally desires freedom; but, as Elihu says to Job, if it is not as subject to God's gracious dealings, it is choosing iniquity rather than affliction -- there is a want both of uprightness and submission.<a name=90:7></a> When once the heart is fully restored (and with an upright conscience we shall pretty well know this, and God will perfectly, that if there be subjection to Him, and the desire of perfectness of heart, the deliverance will be surely at the right time) the desire of deliverance has its fully right place.<a name=90:8></a> It is the desire to be manifestly with Him in peace, and to glorify and praise Him openly.<a name=90:9></a> Outward enemies had been reproaching in Psalm 42 but they were God's waves and billows.<a name=90:10></a> But "where is thy God?<a name=90:11></a>" was the terrible thing.<a name=90:12></a> His soul became athirst for Him.<a name=90:13></a> Now he desires judgment of his cause and deliverance.<a name=90:14></a> There was a nearer trial than outward oppression, though he was still under it, the direct wickedness of injustice with which he had to do.<a name=90:15></a> He looked for God's light and truth to come out and lead him and bring him to God's holy hill.<a name=90:16></a> It is not the consciousness that God was his secret delight to which he had been brought, but that He who was would, by His power, lead Him now to open praise and worship.<a name=90:17></a> The God of strength would bring him there; he would be present with Him who was his exceeding joy.<a name=90:18></a>

		This hope encourages his heart and brings him back, too, to that which was the secret and fulness of his joy and which he possessed in hope, that God would be the health of his countenance.<a name=91:1></a> He was morally his exceeding joy.<a name=91:2></a> Now it would shine forth in glad worship, and be reflected in the gladness of the countenance of him who enjoyed it.<a name=91:3></a> The panting after God was the result in the last psalm, though looking out for blessing.<a name=91:4></a> Here this is wrought in the soul, and, though not restored yet to outward public blessings, God is his exceeding joy, and God his God; and the outward restoration is presently looked forward to.<a name=91:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Psalm 44.<a name=91:6></a> We have certainly in this book of the psalms moral exercises more deeply and fully developed.<a name=91:7></a> The soul has to do with God; but the application is not the easier to the Christian state, for this simple reason: the exercises flowing from relationship under trial are not the theme of this book, but exercises of soul with God, when the enjoyment of known relationship is lost.<a name=91:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence, while in the former part, in order to apply it to the Christian, it was only needed to apprehend the change of relationship from Jehovah to Father; having in Christianity a relationship founded on the destruction of all in flesh, one in that relationship has passed beyond the whole position in this book.<a name=91:9></a> The state of the Christian reveals, and is known in, the exercise of a heavenly one.<a name=91:10></a> Hence the proper state of the Christian is found less here even than in the first book.<a name=91:11></a> But the relationship of an exercised soul with God, on the other hand, comes out into relief.<a name=91:12></a>

		In this psalm the faithful one recognises that through divine favour and power alone they had enjoyed the blessings of which they were now deprived, the signs of God's favour.<a name=92:1></a> The direct government of God is owned, "Thou art my king, O God," is the language of Israel, but always true, though the authority now, without being less absolute, is infinitely sweeter.<a name=92:2></a> He is our Lord by redemption.<a name=92:3></a> We do not deny the Lord that bought us.<a name=92:4></a> This was still the faithful one's trust.<a name=92:5></a> In Elohim he made his boast, and praised His name for ever; but they were given up, and their enemies had the upper hand; yet they held fast, and did not forget God, nor were unfaithful to the covenant.<a name=92:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Two great principles, faithfulness to the will and authority of God, whatever disaster and seeming desertion there may be, and looking for no other help than God Himself, who seems to have deserted the faithful, are here in play.<a name=92:7></a> This puts integrity utterly to the test, and personal faith; and that is just what is needed for the soul to be in the state in which it can be restored to the full joy of positive blessing.<a name=92:8></a> The fact that God thus tests His people (and He does so now spiritually before peace be obtained) is one of deep import.<a name=92:9></a> It brings out what we have seen characterises this book -- absolute trust in God, in Himself; and it shews that uprightness with Him is before all comfort or ease for the heart: for, if nothing is got from it, they hold to Him for His own sake.<a name=92:10></a> He Himself is the object, and Himself, morally, and in His claim upon them.<a name=92:11></a> Hence the heart cannot turn to anything else, for it is not God, nor help which would relieve it from His ways.<a name=92:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This brings in another point which this psalm leads us to, that the trials which accompany this apparent desertion are attributed to God's own hand.<a name=92:13></a> "Thou makest us to turn our back .<a name=92:14></a>.<a name=92:15></a>.<a name=92:16></a> .<a name=92:17></a> Thou hast given us like sheep.<a name=92:18></a>" There is another thought connected with this psalm besides the individual application.<a name=92:19></a> When God confounds and rebukes His people in their public conflicts with the power of evil, when, in the exercise of His government, He allows the power of evil to get the upper hand, and so orders it, this is a deep trial for His people, not only for their own sorrow in it, but because the name of God is dishonoured.<a name=92:20></a> The enemy triumphs in this; but surely the government of God is shewn in it.<a name=92:21></a>

		Here we learn the meditations of the upright soul in these circumstances.<a name=93:1></a> It had not forgotten God, nor behaved unfaithfully as regarded His covenant, though smitten down in the place of dragons.<a name=93:2></a> On the contrary; though it might be the needed public government of God, as regarded the profession of His name, and to separate out the faithful, who may be in the midst of His professed people; yet, as regards those faithful, it was for God's name they were suffering.<a name=93:3></a> This is still, I judge, somewhat different from Jehovah's name.<a name=93:4></a> Of course it was Jehovah, as with the Father, but here it is for what God is as such.<a name=93:5></a> Not only faithfulness in not denying the revealed name is there, but it was for what God is that they were suffering.<a name=93:6></a> There was no turning in heart to idols.<a name=93:7></a> They preferred suffering anything, or suffer what they might, for owning the true God; they would do it for His own sake, for the attachment of their heart to Him, for what He was when they got no blessing; because the God who was in covenant with His people was the true God, and they would be tried, not only for the covenant blessings, but for their heart -- attachment to what He was in Ms nature: and so in principle with us.<a name=93:8></a> And this is joy; because the love of integrity, the partaking of the divine nature, by which we delight in what is good, in what is of God, gives the consciousness of itself, the conscious delight there is in that nature in rejoicing in what is good and right.<a name=93:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not self-righteousness, but the conscious delight in good of the divine nature, proper divine joy in its nature; only in our case it must have an object, God Himself, and this is tested in us by suffering for God.<a name=93:10></a> Hence the true case is -- for the enemy hated God -- "For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.<a name=93:11></a>" To test it fully, and make it real suffering for God, the blessings which belong to His power must not be there.<a name=93:12></a> Hence the upright are left for the time to the oppression of the enemy.<a name=93:13></a> This, while it searches the heart, if there be any false way, makes it here suffering for what God is; and on the cry for mercy, in due time, brings in the answer from Him; for He cannot leave what answers to His nature -- integrity towards Him -- needlessly in the power of evil.<a name=93:14></a> And so it ever is; though our joy <i>may</i> be in another world altogether, yet, as a rule, God as to His covenant, delivers in this.<a name=93:15></a>

		But the Christian goes yet farther, though this be true of him.<a name=98:18></a> He can say, "That we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead.<a name=98:19></a>" But he says more: "We had the sentence of death in ourselves.<a name=98:20></a>" He does not at all take, as the remnant, his portion this side of death; so that deliverance from it to live here is the object of his soul.<a name=98:21></a> Christ having died, his connection with this world has ceased, save as a pilgrim through it.<a name=98:22></a> He has the sentence of death in himself.<a name=98:23></a> He knows no man after the flesh, no, not even Christ.<a name=98:24></a> His associations with the world are closed, save as Christ's servant in it.<a name=98:25></a> He reckons himself dead.<a name=98:26></a> He is crucified with Christ, yet lives; but it is Christ lives in him, and he lives the life he lives in the flesh by the faith of the Son of God, who loved him and gave Himself for him, so that he is delivered from this present world.<a name=98:27></a> This, while it puts the believer on the ground of this psalm, as far as it goes as to its great principle, yet sets him in a totally different position.<a name=98:28></a> There is not a question about escaping death (though outwardly he may, for we shall not all die), for death is a gain, and he reckons himself dead and his life hid with Christ in God, and Christ to be His life.<a name=98:29></a> Yet this only shews still more, what the psalm insists on, the folly of laying up and making oneself great, and counting on a future in a world where death reigns and in the things to which its power applies.<a name=98:30></a> Man being in honour abides not.<a name=98:31></a>

		The soul in which God's Spirit works, may, as to this, be in the following states.<a name=103:1></a> First, exercised, but ignorant, having a general idea of mercy, it may apply all these consequences of sin to itself vaguely but with terror.<a name=103:2></a> When forgiveness is known (and specially when it is known with little depth of conviction of sin), but the righteousness of God not, the soul, losing the sense of forgiveness through failure or carelessness, sees judgment before it, without having righteousness, and all previous joy becomes bitterness, and the sense of loss (Hebrews 6); is applied, and all the passages which speak of continuing as a condition or of falling away.<a name=103:3></a> But the soul is not really set free here.<a name=103:4></a> It has known forgiveness, not righteousness.<a name=103:5></a> It has known the blood on the door-post, not the Red Sea.<a name=103:6></a> It is in the path of learning divine righteousness and abiding peace before God in Christ risen.<a name=103:7></a> There is yet the case, where, with the truth known, sin has been trifled with, and there the enemy gets power -- a case I have already spoken of, where there is no power to apply the word or promises, and every bitter sentence is applied to oneself.<a name=103:8></a> Yet, God's justice seen to be right, Satan, so to speak, is the interpreter of the word, not God.<a name=103:9></a> Yet this, God uses as chastisement, to set the soul right; and the soul, through grace, clings to God in spite of all.<a name=103:10></a>

		Psalm 62.<a name=114:22></a> Waiting on God is the subject of this psalm.<a name=114:23></a> it implies dependence, confidence; and both in such sort that we abide God's time: dependence, because we cannot do anything without Him, and ought not, because what He does is what the soul alone desires, because action without Him, even in self-defence, is only the action of our own will, and so our being without God so far.<a name=114:24></a> Saul did not wait upon God.<a name=114:25></a> He waited nearly seven days; but if he had felt he was dependent, and nothing could be done without God, he would have done nothing till Samuel came.<a name=114:26></a> He did not; he acted for himself, and lost the kingdom.<a name=114:27></a> Deliverance from God is sweet; it is love; it is righteous, holy deliverance; it becomes the revelation of the favour and grace of God.<a name=114:28></a> It is perfect in time, way, place.<a name=114:29></a> So where the soul waits for it, will not being at work, it meets and enjoys the deliverance in this perfectness; and we are perfect and complete in the will of God.<a name=114:30></a> But it implies confidence too; for why should we wait if God would not come in?<a name=114:31></a> The soul is thus sustained meanwhile.<a name=114:32></a> And this confidence is such that we tarry the Lord's leisure.<a name=114:33></a> Patience has its perfect work, so that we should be perfect and complete in all the will of God.<a name=114:34></a> There is too an active reckoning upon God.<a name=114:35></a> But this leaves the soul absolutely and exclusively waiting on Him.<a name=114:36></a> It is not active for itself; it waits only upon God.<a name=114:37></a> ("Truly" in verse 1 and "only" in verses 2, 4, 5 and 6 is the same word in Hebrew.<a name=114:38></a>)

		The two points connected with it shew the state of soul "from him cometh my salvation"; "my expectation is from him.<a name=115:1></a>" He only is the rock and salvation; so the confiding soul waits for Him, and seeks no other refuge -- looks for deliverance only from Him.<a name=115:2></a> Hence, in principle (in fact, in Christ), the heart is perfect in its confidence, and meets in dependence the perfectness of God; it accepts nothing but that, because it is assured that God is perfect and will act perfectly in the right time.<a name=115:3></a> Faith corresponds thus to the perfection of God.<a name=115:4></a> On the other hand there is no working of self-will at all, no acceptance or saving of self by an intervention inferior in its nature to God Himself.<a name=115:5></a> This makes patient waiting on God a principle of immense moment.<a name=115:6></a> It characterises faith in the Psalms, and so Christ Himself.<a name=115:7></a>

		But there are a few points yet to remark.<a name=115:8></a> "Trust in him at all times.<a name=115:9></a>" There is constancy in this confidence, and constancy in all circumstances.<a name=115:10></a> If I look morally to Him, He is always competent, always the same, He does not change.<a name=115:11></a> I cannot act without Him, if I believe that He only is perfect in His ways.<a name=115:12></a> But, note, this does not suppose there is not exercise and trial of heart; or indeed waiting upon God would not have to be called for.<a name=115:13></a> But if God is faithful, and awaits the time suited to the truth and His own character, so that His ways should be perfect, He is full of goodness and tender love to those who wait upon Him.<a name=115:14></a> He calls upon them to pour out their hearts before Him.<a name=115:15></a> How truly was this the case with Christ too!<a name=115:16></a> How in John 12, and above all in Gethsemane, He poured out His heart before God!<a name=115:17></a> God is always a refuge: He acts in the right time.<a name=115:18></a> He is always a refuge for the heart; and the heart realises what He is when the deliverance is not come: and in some respects this is more precious than the deliverance itself But it supposes integrity.<a name=115:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But yet another point.<a name=115:20></a> The effect of thus waiting on God's deliverance is to make us know that it will be perfect and complete when it does come.<a name=115:21></a> "I shall not be moved.<a name=115:22></a>" He had to wait, indeed, till God came in in perfectness; but then His power secured from all.<a name=115:23></a> Man may think there is a resource in man, or in what man possesses, or in man's strength of will; but power, faith knows, belongs to God.<a name=115:24></a> The last verse shews that the soul is looking to the perfect divine righteousness of God's ways, but in the sense of integrity.<a name=115:25></a> The final intervention of God, the judgment He executes, will be the deliverance of the righteous.<a name=115:26></a> He has identified himself with God's ways on earth in heart, and waited till God makes them good, perfectly good, in power.<a name=115:27></a> But this will be the end of evil, and mercy to those who have sought good, and waited for God to avenge them.<a name=115:28></a> It will be a righteous reward to the expecting righteous man: his waiting will be met, and the power of evil set aside.<a name=115:29></a> In this path we have to walk.<a name=115:30></a> God deals so now in government, though not in its final accomplishment: but we have thus to count and wait upon Him.<a name=115:31></a>

		Psalm 63 supposes the full knowledge of the blessings of relationship with God, but not the full enjoyment of those blessings; on the contrary, that he who thus knows them is in a place entirely the contrary of all their blessedness.<a name=116:1></a> But then, the thing sought and desired is not the blessing, but God Himself, and the revelation of His glory where He dwells.<a name=116:2></a> The whole being thirsts after Himself.<a name=116:3></a> The effect of being in the world, in the dry and thirsty land, is not complaint, nor even looking for deliverance; but thirst is thirsting after God.<a name=116:4></a> This sense of nature which craves after Him gives us the consciousness also that He is our God.<a name=116:5></a> It is the perfect delight the divine nature in us has in Him which gives the sense of this relationship.<a name=116:6></a> They cannot be separated.<a name=116:7></a> To have any knowledge of God, and not know Him as ours, is despair, or near to it as may be.<a name=116:8></a> And God even so is not known as the spring of delight, so that we desire Him.<a name=116:9></a> "<i>My</i> God," and this thirst cannot be separated.<a name=116:10></a> It is not Jehovah and blessings, but the divine nature and God its delight; but with the dependent sense of appropriation expressed in "my God.<a name=116:11></a>" The soul which has the same desires in their nature as God Himself (hence desires after Himself), feels morally and really that He is its God.<a name=116:12></a> This was perfectly so in Christ only; and we never lose the sense of relationship and retain this.<a name=116:13></a> Still it is true in the nature of the delight, when that delight does not take the form of relationship, but of nature; when I do not say, Father, but "my God.<a name=116:14></a>"

		But then this very thirst and desire after God longs to see Him possessing His full power and glory, and must.<a name=117:1></a> We cannot love much One we look up to without desiring Him to enjoy all the fulness of the glory that belongs to Him, and to see Him in it.<a name=117:2></a> We owe our delight in Him, and feeling of indebtedness to Him; we must desire He should have all that is due to Him, and that we should see Him have it.<a name=117:3></a> And this feeling even Christ meets: "Father, I will that they whom thou hast given me be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory, for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.<a name=117:4></a>" But the main desire, the spring of all this, is the desire after God Himself, and known as our God, come what will.<a name=117:5></a> Not only the heart can appropriate it, as has been said, but would have it so, and none else.<a name=117:6></a> The nature which is of God would have none but Him, and would earnestly have Him.<a name=117:7></a> Where God is truly known thus, and the soul identified with Him in desire, the fact that it is where there is not one drop of what can refresh it, as is the case in this world, only renders this longing after Him more intense.<a name=117:8></a> But it is because He is known, known as He reveals Himself in the intimacy of His own nature, in the sanctuary where He displays Himself and makes Himself known.<a name=117:9></a> But with this there is another thought: that is, when God is thus known as He is in the sanctuary, His loving kindness, His grace, His favour, and goodness, are felt by the soul.<a name=117:10></a> The sense of them rests upon it.<a name=117:11></a> This is better than life, which means life here, the present enjoyment of it in this world; and, as to that, he had absolutely nothing of it: so Paul, "If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.<a name=117:12></a>" There indeed it was more outward pressure; here the inward necessary sense, from the life in which he speaks and feels here, that there was not the smallest thing in what was in the world which could meet and refresh that nature.<a name=117:13></a> So perfectly with Christ.<a name=117:14></a> Still, though connected with trial, this was remarkably unfolded in Paul.<a name=117:15></a> He rejoiced in the Lord alway, when nothing refreshed his spirit.<a name=117:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence, in the sense of this loving kindness, in a dry and thirsty land his lips praised his God.<a name=117:17></a> This is very sweet; and, note, it is perfect in its nature, because it is simply God; for in the land the saint is in, there is absolutely nothing.<a name=117:18></a> God, his God, is his desire; His loving kindness is the refreshing of his soul.<a name=117:19></a> Now this is perfect divine life in one having the divine nature, but in the place of dependence, known only to the soul born of God, or in its perfection.<a name=117:20></a> So Christ.<a name=117:21></a>

		This gives then exclusively its colour to life.<a name=118:1></a> "Thus will I bless thee while I live" (down here in the dry and thirsty land).<a name=118:2></a> This is all his soul lives in <i>here</i>.<a name=118:3></a> Hence in this life he blesses God, his God.<a name=118:4></a> His whole life in the dry land is in spirit out of it.<a name=118:5></a> Nothing attracts his soul in it at all.<a name=118:6></a> It finds its refreshings, because the land is altogether such to the new nature, wholly in God.<a name=118:7></a> Yet he is not in the present full enjoyment of God as present; he is still in the dry and thirsty land, but blesses while he lives, and owns and worships the God he thus knows.<a name=118:8></a> But there is perfect happiness and satisfaction of heart when separated from the turmoil of the world; and when nothing is there to engage the flesh's attention, which is perfect misery to the flesh, but real deliverance to the renewed spirit, the soul can meditate upon God Himself The soul finds in God Himself the fullest and richest food.<a name=118:9></a> The soul is satisfied, does not want anything else, when it can be thus alone with God, in whom is its delight, but is filled with it.<a name=118:10></a>

		Next, the psalm takes up not merely distractions, but adverse circumstances -- the force of enemies.<a name=119:1></a> The soul sees God, its God, as its help, that is, as having been so.<a name=119:2></a> God was his joy; and his soul, in this wholly desert world, where no water is, was satisfied as with marrow and fatness.<a name=119:3></a> That was taking it in spirit out of the world, making it joy in God.<a name=119:4></a> But the Blessed One was what he needed for this world too, its conflicts and trials.<a name=119:5></a> And this is very gracious of God.<a name=119:6></a> We rejoice in the Lord always as looking to the source of our joy.<a name=119:7></a> But if without are fightings, and even within fears, He comforts them that are cast down.<a name=119:8></a> "Because thou hast been my help.<a name=119:9></a>" But here is described as already experienced what Paul speaks of himself as experiencing.<a name=119:10></a> Hence it is the aspect of the soul towards God because of this.<a name=119:11></a> The soul would rejoice under the shadow of God's wings.<a name=119:12></a> It was the known place of refuge and confidence.<a name=119:13></a> There is the comfort of feeling at all times the favour of God, and the security in which we thus dwell.<a name=119:14></a> I know not what may arise, but He will be there; nor this only, but the sense of His goodness and active interest in the soul is a source of sweet joy to it.<a name=119:15></a> The soul rejoices in having this divine favour its refuge, and actively interested in securing it.<a name=119:16></a> Thus the soul's condition is this in its activities, it follows hard after God.<a name=119:17></a> It would follow Him, come to Him, enjoy His presence; and it had the sure certainty that His right hand upholds it.<a name=119:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		On the whole the psalm shews us simple faith, the soul making God Himself its joy, and rejoicing in the sure care of the Lord, whose favour protected it as a shield.<a name=119:22></a> If we compare this psalm with Psalm 84, which in many respects resembles it, it will be seen that there the present enjoyment of covenant blessings is in view, and the way up to them; here more what God Himself is as away from them in the dry thirsty land, and His protection and care in the difficulties and dangers we are in there.<a name=119:23></a> If we think of the remnant driven out, which is the character of the book prophetically, it makes this view easily intelligible.<a name=119:24></a>

		Psalm 64 shews a peculiar course of things in the world, yet one with which every one exercised in the service of God in this world is familiar -- that of the wicked, who hate righteousness, seeking to charge evil on the upright.<a name=120:1></a> This shews the universality and power of conscience, and another truth too -- that the principles of those who trust God and confess His name are expected to produce what is purely good.<a name=120:2></a> This is really the strongest witness to the principles of faith on the one hand, and to the utter wickedness of the human heart on the other.<a name=120:3></a> The wicked recognise that faith ought to produce, and, as its own proper fruit, does produce, what is right and perfect, and expects it from him who walks by faith.<a name=120:4></a> But they shew their hatred of that principle, and of those who cleave to the Lord by it, by searching out iniquity and inconsistency.<a name=120:5></a> This is a terrible proof of the wickedness of the world; and yet it is universal, not only found, yea, not so much found among the openly ungodly as in decent unbelievers.<a name=120:6></a> Here it is indeed in those who pursue iniquity wilfully, not evident immorality but wickedness, who are pursuing it in their secret counsels.<a name=120:7></a> Yet it is the spirit of evil in man.<a name=120:8></a> Plotting is characteristic of evil, but its extreme character.<a name=120:9></a> But there is concurrence of feeling and acting with a like mind when it has not gone so far as plotting, because a like spirit animates them.<a name=120:10></a> Then their tongues are the instruments of attack and injury.<a name=120:11></a> The saint has no outward defence or remedy, but as to this, as with regard to violence, God is his refuge.<a name=120:12></a>

		Psalm 65 refers directly to the blessing of this creation, and the praise and joy which will spring forth when He sets aside the power of evil, but looks, as witnesses of it, to the present effect of His goodness.<a name=121:1></a> It looks, for the groaning creation waits, not only for Israel as here, but much more in order to -- its deliverance, for the manifestation of the sons of God, for the blessing of God's people, that this universal blessing may take place; but the heart is ready, and this leads us to a general principle instructive to us at all times -- the readiness of heart to praise in the midst of trial, and the almighty power which is looked to, whose nature is to give blessing.<a name=121:2></a> But this psalm again applies only to the circumstances of the believer.<a name=121:3></a> The Christian is never <i>according to the Spirit</i>, in a state of soul in which he cannot praise.<a name=121:4></a> His heart may have got away from God, so that the Spirit has to rebuke him and humble him, but then praise is not ready at all.<a name=121:5></a> Here the thought is that, though the heart be ready, circumstances do not furnish occasion to praise.<a name=121:6></a> Praise is silent, though there is the consciousness that praise belongs to God; the vow will be performed.<a name=121:7></a> This may be the Christian's case.<a name=121:8></a> He may say in trying circumstances, I am sure I shall yet praise and thank Him for deliverance.<a name=121:9></a> And this is a right spirit.<a name=121:10></a> As to our highest praise, this is always the case.<a name=121:11></a> In the heavenly courts our praise is yet silent, and we wait and long for it.<a name=121:12></a> Verse 4 plainly shews that this is the Jewish form of it: it is the thought of the psalm.<a name=121:13></a> The general thought there is, we only await the blessing to be fulfilled for praise to break out.<a name=121:14></a> God's faithfulness and power are celebrated as assuring this: here in judgment and for earthly blessings; but the Christian, whatever hindrance and adverse powers there may be, counts on this faithfulness and power of God to bring him into the heavenly city.<a name=121:15></a> Transgressions will not bar the way; through grace only we say, "thou hast purged them away.<a name=121:16></a>" He hears our prayer and helps us.<a name=121:17></a>

		Further, it is a question of the necessary glory of the Lord, and even in the earthly part; but the principle is there.<a name=122:1></a> All flesh must come to Him.<a name=122:2></a> This the Jew looked to as a part of the glory.<a name=122:3></a> God's purposes must be accomplished to His glory, but He has in grace identified them with us.<a name=122:4></a> As Paul expresses it, by the Spirit, All the promises of God are in Him (Christ), yea, and in Him Amen, to the glory of God by us.<a name=122:5></a> Hence faith, assured that God must be glorified, looks to our own glory and blessing in it.<a name=122:6></a> This marks faith, not merely believing that God is glorious, but connecting His glory with the blessing of His people.<a name=122:7></a> So Moses, "What wilt thou do to thy great name?<a name=122:8></a>" "The Egyptians will hear of it"; and so ever in his pleadings with God.<a name=122:9></a> What a source of security and ground for praise, that God should have thus identified His glory with our blessing and His promises to us in Christ!<a name=122:10></a>

		Psalm 66.<a name=122:11></a> There is one point in this psalm as to its moral force which is of great interest to notice: the way in which, when deliverance comes, all is ascribed to God.<a name=122:12></a> And God is seen all through.<a name=122:13></a> It goes back to original redemption, the unequivocal source of all (verse 6), while the final blessing of God's people is the blessing of the world.<a name=122:14></a> Even when all seemed to have been darkness, it is now seen His power was above all.<a name=122:15></a> He rules by His power for ever.<a name=122:16></a> His eyes behold the nations.<a name=122:17></a> Woe to him that exalts himself!<a name=122:18></a> But not only this: God is seen in the trouble itself, and as the author of it though our failures may have been the occasion of it, This is the true test of the heart being right -- what is called (as to Israel in Leviticus), accepting the punishment of our iniquity.<a name=122:19></a> Two things are seen in it: God brought them into the trouble; He held their soul in life through it.<a name=122:20></a> So with job in both points.<a name=122:21></a> Nor did He suffer their feet to be moved out of the divine path of faith by the trial.<a name=122:22></a>

		But some other points come out as to the state of the soul meanwhile.<a name=123:1></a> The trouble had cast the soul on God.<a name=123:2></a> And though to us all such things as vows are wrong, yet the reference of the heart to Him, the turning of it to Him as the source of hope in a better way, though under chastisement, is just what hoping in Him produces.<a name=123:3></a> Have confidence in, and wait on, Him when tried, and chastened; till the will is broken, we cannot; when it is, we can, though conscious the sorrow is the fruit of our fault.<a name=123:4></a> This supposes integrity; it issues in thanksgiving.<a name=123:5></a> The heart can then too bear testimony for God to others; it has known what He has been for itself.<a name=123:6></a> It cried and He heard.<a name=123:7></a> This, says the apostle, is the confidence we have in Him.<a name=123:8></a> For what is here learnt through sorrow should be the constant state of the soul without it.<a name=123:9></a> Still the governing feeling of the soul is its own thankfulness, and so it will be.<a name=123:10></a> It will turn back to that, that is, to God -- to the secret of its own thankfulness to Him, which is the joy of the heart.<a name=123:11></a> The force of the psalm is recognising all this after deliverance; but what it produces when received into the heart is answering faith when the trouble is there.<a name=123:12></a>

		THIRD BOOK -- PSALM 73-89
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Although Psalm 73, which begins the third book of Psalms, refers directly to the temporal judgment of God in Israel, as satisfying the anxieties of heart among the faithful; yet, as these anxieties are of all times we shall find something to note here.<a name=124:1></a> We see the ungodly having their way, so that God seems to have forgotten, and the heart is envious.<a name=124:2></a> But it shews in our case too often that the heart would yet have its portion here -- at least a portion here as well as one to come.<a name=124:3></a> The sorrow at the power of evil in the world is right, but it mingles itself in our minds with liking to have one's own way and judgment in setting it aside.<a name=124:4></a> When the will mixes itself up with the sense of the success of evil, it is either irritated or disheartened so as to give up perseverance in good.<a name=124:5></a> The ungodly prosper in the world.<a name=124:6></a> What a riddle!<a name=124:7></a> Where is God's government?<a name=124:8></a> What is the use of good?<a name=124:9></a> No doubt it was more directly trying where temporal blessings had been made a sign of divine favour.<a name=124:10></a> But Christians are seldom separated enough from this world not to feel the success of wickedness, and a desire to take vengeance on it.<a name=124:11></a> Mere indifference to it is utterly evil.<a name=124:12></a> Thus the path is narrow, and grace must work in the heart to lead us in it to feel the evil in itself, to feel God's glory cast in the dust by it; but to abide God's time and way, as Christ did when He suffered.<a name=124:13></a>

		There is no place of learning but in the sanctuary.<a name=125:1></a> There the will is bowed: there God is known: there the eye is not obscured by the passions of the world, and an ignorance of how to do what God alone could do -- make allowance for any good, have perfect patience with evil, so that judgement shall be simply on evil, and be true judgement on evil without excuse.<a name=125:2></a> Our impatience would be nothing of this, even where the evil as such is justly judged.<a name=125:3></a> But in the sanctuary the will is silent and God is listened to.<a name=125:4></a> His ways are right, and we see things with His eye.<a name=125:5></a> The evil is worse, the compassion right, the patience adorable, yet the judgment sure; so that the sense of righteousness is not crossed in the heart, though the will of vengeance is; for the wrath of man does not work the righteousness of God.<a name=125:6></a> The judgment is righteous because patience is perfect -- far more terrible because there is no passion in it.<a name=125:7></a> It refers to God.<a name=125:8></a> When we desire that fire may come down from heaven, self is in it.<a name=125:9></a> We do not know what manner of spirit we are of; yet, in one sense, they really deserved it.<a name=125:10></a> When God awaked in His own just time, they are as a dream.<a name=125:11></a> Their pride, pretensions, all is as a departed image.<a name=125:12></a> Faith has to believe this, and leave them there.<a name=125:13></a>

		But another blessed truth comes out here.<a name=125:14></a> He had been foolish, ignorant -- "as a beast," so he says, "before God"; yet there had been integrity and conscience.<a name=125:15></a> If he had let his thoughts loose when half disposed to say godliness was no use, he would have offended against the generation of God's children.<a name=125:16></a> This checked him.<a name=125:17></a> How beautiful to see in the waywardness of man's will these holy affections, this conscience of putting a stumbling -- block in the path of the weakest of God's children, check the heart, and shew where the affections really are, and that fear of God which shews He is lovingly known -- that the new nature is there!<a name=125:18></a> It is a great mark of good that God is owned.<a name=125:19></a> But what he knows of himself is that he was as a beast in his heart's reasoning as it did.<a name=125:20></a> But, then, mark what is seen.<a name=125:21></a> He comes to see that, in spite of all this, while owning his folly, he was continually with God.<a name=125:22></a> O how the full knowledge of self, when we know as we are known, will shew the patient unvarying grace of God waiting on us all the way in adorable love and interest in us!<a name=125:23></a> Through all his foolishness he was continually with God, and God had holden him by his right hand.<a name=125:24></a> Blessed grace!<a name=125:25></a> God loves us, cares for us, watches over us, is interested in us; because of His sovereign love, we are necessary to His satisfaction.<a name=125:26></a> He withdraweth not His eyes from the righteous.<a name=125:27></a> This is a wondrous thought of constant grace.<a name=125:28></a> But He is God, and not man.<a name=125:29></a> And so the heart here counts on Him.<a name=125:30></a>

		Up to this, through all his shortcomings in faith, he could say, "Thou hast holden": now he says, as in communion, "Thou wilt guide me by thy counsel.<a name=126:1></a>" This is not merely holding up unconsciously; it is the mind and will of God guiding us in communion.<a name=126:2></a> Hence it is seen when he has judged himself and is in communion; it is not that God does not guide us -- make us go according to His own counsels, when we are not in communion, holding our mouths -- with bit and bridle; for He does.<a name=126:3></a> But the soul does not understand it, then cannot speak, as here, in the knowledge of His doing it by Ms counsel.<a name=126:4></a> This He does.<a name=126:5></a> Here we meet, in the full force of the passage, the plain distinction of the Jewish position.<a name=126:6></a> "After the glory, thou wilt receive me.<a name=126:7></a>" It has been altered to make more of it for Christian ideas, and the true meaning is lost.<a name=126:8></a> Compare Zechariah 2: 8.<a name=126:9></a>

		Psalm 76.<a name=128:13></a> The general subject is still judgment executed in connection with Israel.<a name=128:14></a> But there is a general principle we may notice.<a name=128:15></a> First, that the seat of God's blessing and throne, or its manifestation on earth, low as it may fall, is more excellent than all the might and violence of man.<a name=128:16></a> At God's rebuke these fall, and man has no strength.<a name=128:17></a> When God arises, what can man do?<a name=128:18></a> But God's execution of judgment on the earth has an immediate effect and purpose -- the deliverance of the meek.<a name=128:19></a> He saves all the meek of the earth.<a name=128:20></a> His love and faithful goodness are even here in exercise.<a name=128:21></a> Then comes another principle, applicable at all times by faith, and an encouraging and consoling principle.<a name=128:22></a> God makes the wrath of man to praise Him.<a name=128:23></a> He turns everything to His own glory and purpose, and then stops all the rest.<a name=128:24></a> Where faith is in exercise, it counts on God through all, sure that God will have the last and final word in the matter.<a name=128:25></a>

		In Psalm 77 we have some instructive points to notice.<a name=129:1></a> The complaint goes farther, perhaps, than that of any Christian ought to go.<a name=129:2></a> The seventh verse for us would be simple unbelief; whereas for the Jew, whose people are cast off as regards all their privileges, the question justly arises, as in Romans 11, "I say then hath God cast away his people?<a name=129:3></a>" But if we keep this in mind, there is much to instruct us as regards the time of deep trouble, as when the pressure of very adverse circumstances or even our own fault may have brought the soul into deep distress as to that which surrounds it.<a name=129:4></a> The subject of this psalm is that he actually and actively sought the Lord.<a name=129:5></a> It was a direct appeal of the heart, not merely a wish nor submission.<a name=129:6></a> He went with his voice to God about it.<a name=129:7></a> This is more important than we are apt to suppose.<a name=129:8></a>

		I do not think it altogether just, that "prayer is the soul's sincere desire, uttered or unexpressed.<a name=129:9></a>" I surely admit that there may be a sigh or a groan where the Holy Ghost's intercession is, and that the lifting up of the heart to God will never find repulse or coldness there.<a name=129:10></a> All that I admit; but there is an actual carrying a known want or trouble to God, the expression of the need we are in.<a name=129:11></a> The heart expresses itself in a distinct application.<a name=129:12></a> Thus it brings itself before God, and this is very important in our relationship with God.<a name=129:13></a> There is truth in the inward parts, and true confiding dependence.<a name=129:14></a> Up to this there was gnawing trouble, the working of the heart on the trouble, the soul refusing to be comforted.<a name=129:15></a> The will was at work, and could not get what it wanted.<a name=129:16></a> The soul <i>thinks</i> of God, but no comfort was there.<a name=129:17></a> There was but its own thoughts of Him; there was complaint, not prayer, and the spirit overwhelmed.<a name=129:18></a> So, when awake, he cannot be occupied naturally with ordinary matters, he is silent through trouble.<a name=129:19></a> It is a strong picture of a thoroughly distressed soul; only fully realised when a soul, through the chastening hand of God, has lost the sense of divine favour, or does not yet know peace, but which in a certain degree of not looking to Him may be the case with any one.<a name=129:20></a> But the soul turns to God.<a name=129:21></a> It has enjoyed mercy and songs in the night.<a name=129:22></a> Would the Lord cast off for ever?<a name=129:23></a> For the Christian this question has no place; but when the shield of faith is down, and the fiery darts of the wicked have reached the heart, a terrible and sore chastisement.<a name=129:24></a> The only thing like it is when a soul has lightly received the gospel in its mercy (without, however, being insincere), and the work of conscience goes on afterwards.<a name=129:25></a> When, instead of communing with self and reasoning with its own misery, it looks to God, the heart sees all this in itself, not in God.<a name=129:26></a> This is the turning-point.<a name=129:27></a>

		But the Christian does not go back to former mercies (as the Jew would, and rightly would), because he always stands in present favour, even if Satan have got hold of his mind for a time, and he returns into the sunshine of it, when the cloud that arose out of his own heart is passed.<a name=130:1></a> The Jews had early sovereign blessings, and are right to remember it when they have been cast off, though it be not for ever.<a name=130:2></a> The Christian is never cast off.<a name=130:3></a> Hence he has not to remember but enters again into the enjoyment of divine favour which has never ceased.<a name=130:4></a> In the rest of the psalm the Christian learns God's way is in the sanctuary.<a name=130:5></a> Let His favour be ever so unchangeable, His <i>way</i> is always according to His own holiness, though for the very same reason according to His own faithful love.<a name=130:6></a> Whenever Israel turns back, it is to sovereign grace and redemption.<a name=130:7></a> God's way is in the sea -- untraceable and in power.<a name=130:8></a> All the movements and power of what seems ungovernable and not to be got through are in Ms hand.<a name=130:9></a> On the whole, the psalm is the contrast between the working of the soul in restless anxiety in thus indulging its own thoughts, and turning, when it has recollected God, to cry to Himself.<a name=130:10></a> If the Christian apply it to interrupted favour, he is all wrong.<a name=130:11></a> But he may learn, in respect to overwhelming sorrow when the will is at work, that there is no rest till the soul remembers God and cries to Him.<a name=130:12></a>

		Although Psalm 78 be evidently a recapitulation of the history of Israel, convicting them of their disobedience and unbelief, the uselessness as to their hearts of all God's dealings with them, and then, so magnificently, His turning to His own sovereign grace to bless, yet there are some of the marks of unbelief, and warnings as to it, which it will be profitable to us to note.<a name=130:13></a> The great principle of the psalm which I have noticed is itself of the highest interest.<a name=130:14></a> Sovereign grace is the only resource of God, if He is to bless man.<a name=130:15></a> All dealings, however gracious, fail of their object.<a name=130:16></a> He loves His people, but He has no resource for blessing them but His own grace.<a name=130:17></a> If He acted on the effect of His dealings, He gives them up; they only turned aside like a deceitful bow.<a name=130:18></a> So ever.<a name=130:19></a> But when all was at the worst, He wakes in His love to His people, because of their misery and His love to them.<a name=130:20></a> Then He accomplishes the purpose of His own grace in His own way.<a name=130:21></a> He "chose the tribe of Judah, the Mount Zion, which he loved .<a name=130:22></a>.<a name=130:23></a>.<a name=130:24></a> .<a name=130:25></a> he chose David his servant.<a name=130:26></a>"

		Psalm 79 looks for judgment on the heathen.<a name=131:31></a> This I leave aside here.<a name=131:32></a> The only point I have to notice is the way, when brought very low, the heart turns to God.<a name=131:33></a> It does not even here avenge itself, but (the extreme of evil being come upon it) turns to God, and thus remembers its own sins.<a name=131:34></a> Nor has it any plea but God's own name.<a name=131:35></a> "Remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us .<a name=131:36></a>.<a name=131:37></a>.<a name=131:38></a> .<a name=131:39></a> Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name!<a name=131:40></a> Deliver us, purge away our sins, for thy name's sake.<a name=131:41></a>" Such is the effect of chastisement.<a name=131:42></a> It supposes that we know God.<a name=131:43></a> It produces lowliness of heart, true confession, no pretension to any title to deliverance but God's own goodness and name -- what He is.<a name=131:44></a> Yet the soul rests on that.<a name=131:45></a> There is compassion -- that God attends to the sighing of His prisoners; and (however strong the hand that holds those appointed to die) will act in the greatness of <i>His</i> power to preserve.<a name=131:46></a> The enemy had reproached the Lord in injuring His people.<a name=131:47></a> "Where is their God?<a name=131:48></a>" -- their confidence.<a name=131:49></a> And the Lord shewed Himself; and this is looked for, and His people praise Him.<a name=131:50></a>

		This too shews another point we may often notice in scripture -- not that God simply is glorious, and must maintain His glory; but that He, having taken a people in the earth, has identified His glory with that people.<a name=132:1></a> Faith feels this, with deep sense of it and thankful entering into it, and reckons on deliverance and grace.<a name=132:2></a> God delivers and secures His own glory.<a name=132:3></a> But for the very same reason God allows no evil, because His name is connected with His people, as we see in Israel: "Thee only have I known of all the families of the earth; therefore will I punish you for your iniquities.<a name=132:4></a>" Here the punishment was on them, and the name reproached.<a name=132:5></a> So, humbling themselves, and looking for mercy and purging, they took for deliverance, because God's people were brought low.<a name=132:6></a>

		On Psalms 82 and 83 I have no remark to make in connection with our present object in commenting on the Psalms.<a name=137:1></a> In Psalm 82 the reader will observe that God judges the judges, especially those who in Israel had the divine law to guide them.<a name=137:2></a> They fall thus, from wielding God's authority in the earth, into the place of responsible man, and God arising judges the earth, Here iniquity towards man, the separation of judgment entrusted to man from righteousness, is dealt with by God.<a name=137:3></a> In Psalm 83 it is the way in which man is guilty of active enmity against God, in his hatred against God's people using craft, conspiracy, and violence to destroy their remembrance off the earth, the result being that Jehovah alone (the God of Israel) is the most high over all the earth; for such is the effect of man's efforts.<a name=137:4></a> Oppression downwards in those who represented God in the earth, rebellion upwards against God shewn in hatred against God's earthly people: such are the characters of man, and the object of God's judgment on the earth.<a name=137:5></a>

		Psalm 84.<a name=137:6></a> Though God be necessarily the centre of all our desires, the desires of the new man, yet it is not in this psalm the desire after God as such, which is spoken of as in Psalm 63.<a name=137:7></a> Jehovah is owned as the living God, but He is owned as a manifested God in relationship with His people.<a name=137:8></a> It is not "my soul is athirst <i>for God</i>"; but "how amiable are thy tabernacles, O Jehovah of hosts.<a name=137:9></a>" They would not have been so, if He had not been there, if they had not been His.<a name=137:10></a> Still it is the enjoyed public relationship with Him, dwelling in the midst of His people, which is delighted in, not abstract delight in Himself The tabernacles of God are a resting place for the heart, as the swallow had a nest from God where she might lay her young.<a name=137:11></a> And this is just.<a name=137:12></a> The root and essence of personal piety is the soul's own desire after God.<a name=137:13></a> The secret of God is there, and the soul is kept in the holiness of His presence, and exercised in it before Him.<a name=137:14></a> But where God displays His glory, where He is worshipped, is the just resort of the pious soul.<a name=137:15></a> In His temple shall every one speak of His honour.<a name=137:16></a> There praise is drawn out.<a name=137:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not exercise, but the soul in its piety, as in the new man alone, goes forth in praise and worship where all do, where there is nought else, and with others of the same spirit also.<a name=138:1></a> For the altar of God is the centre of the heart's desire and outgoings.<a name=138:2></a> There God displays Himself, and there the heart is at home from exercises and trials.<a name=138:3></a> Hence it is known to the heart, that there they will be still praising God.<a name=138:4></a> They that dwell there have nought else to do.<a name=138:5></a> Such is the full accomplished blessing.<a name=138:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is another thing (verses 5 to 7) in which blessing is known -- on the way thither, the way through this world, the valley of tears.<a name=138:7></a> The strength of him who passes with an undisturbed heart towards God's rest and dwelling-place is in the Lord.<a name=138:8></a> Hence he too is blessed.<a name=138:9></a> If the dwelling-place of God, where His glory is manifested and fills the place, is the object of the heart, where its desires tend, the way that leads there will be in the heart too.<a name=138:10></a> It may be a rough one, a valley of tears, a valley where the cross is found, but it is the way there, and the heart is in it, Besides, the heart trusts God -- has His love as the key to all.<a name=138:11></a> Hence it says "by these things men live, and in all these things is the life of my spirit.<a name=138:12></a>" They turn the valley of tears into a well, and find in the sorrow the refreshments of grace.<a name=138:13></a> For we need the will broken, the movement of will in the desires of the heart judged, that grace, that God Himself (that well of joy and blessing), may have His full place.<a name=138:14></a> And this the trials and exercises of the wilderness do.<a name=138:15></a> It is not called the valley of trial, but the valley of tears; that is, it is not merely the facts which form the well, but the exercises of heart which flow from them.<a name=138:16></a> No doubt the character of the valley was the source of this; but Christ perfect in His way was a man of sorrows, therein manifesting and exercising His love.<a name=138:17></a> We need humiliation and breaking down that we might get into this state, but this is what makes it a well to us.<a name=138:18></a> By these things men live, and in all these things is the life of the spirit.<a name=138:19></a> He had meat to eat in His sorrow as cast out by the well of Sychar which His disciples knew not of.<a name=138:20></a> But this is not all.<a name=138:21></a> There is direct supply and ministration of grace from above.<a name=138:22></a> God sends a gracious rain on His inheritance, refreshing it when it is weary.<a name=138:23></a> The rain fills the pools.<a name=138:24></a> The communication of the Spirit of God, the revelation of Christ to the soul, the Father's love, all refresh and gladden the heart, and fill it with that which makes the world a nothing, turning the heart elsewhere.<a name=138:25></a> The new man is in its joys, and goes cheerfully thinking of that through the valley.<a name=138:26></a> It goes from strength to strength.<a name=138:27></a> It is not accumulated strength, though strength is increased, but never in any sense so as to diminish dependence on God, but on the contrary to increase the sense of it.<a name=138:28></a>

		Self is better known and more thoroughly distrusted; we are more simple, and have a more simple consciousness that power belongs to God.<a name=139:1></a> As Peter, "when thou art converted (brought back], strengthen thy brethren" -- an extreme case, as to the means, but shewing how self-judgment and the lesson of dependence is the way of having strength, because strength is really in Christ.<a name=139:2></a> "My strength is made perfect in weakness.<a name=139:3></a>" Thus the strength we have and feel at a point where we are brought to realise the grace and presence of Christ sets us forward on our journey across the wilderness; we use it (I do not say lose it) in travel, but it is not the conscious enjoyment of deriving blessing from Him, but employing that strength in the way.<a name=139:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This leads us to a further apprehension of our need of Christ, increased knowledge of self by what we pass through, but which is discovered not always in a judgment we form of ourselves, but in such emptying of self, and the decline of its deceptive power in our heart, as casts us more simply on Christ.<a name=139:5></a> We go to a further place of strength thus; Christ is more all.<a name=139:6></a> If there be failure, it will be in the positive judgment of self and restoring the soul.<a name=139:7></a> The result is our appearing before God, where no self will be at all, and in the place where He has set His blessing, and where all go up to worship and glorify Him.<a name=139:8></a> Even now there is a partial realisation of this, but it s accomplishment will be surely in glory -- in the heavenly Jerusalem and the Father's house.<a name=139:9></a> But all this turns to supplication -- supplication in the sense of divine majesty, but supplication in the consciousness of blessed relationship.<a name=139:10></a> He is Jehovah of hosts, but He is the God of Jacob.<a name=139:11></a>

		But it goes yet further.<a name=140:1></a> Till we are actually in the courts of God, we depend on this majesty and covenant faithfulness -- for us the Father's name in union with Christ -- but also on God's looking on Christ; but this secures us till then -- indeed in one sense for ever.<a name=140:2></a> We are assured, are confident, and pray because God looks on Christ.<a name=140:3></a> But this confidence on the way through Baca is connected with the desire to be in the courts.<a name=140:4></a> "Look upon the face of thine anointed: for a day in thy courts is better than a thousand.<a name=140:5></a>" Better be at the threshold there, than enjoy all that the tents of the wicked can afford, with the right to abide there.<a name=140:6></a> God enlightens with His glorious majesty, and protects.<a name=140:7></a> He will give in perfect unhindered grace all we need in the trial of the way, and in our weakness, when it is sweet to count on His help.<a name=140:8></a> And He will in the end, when brought home capable of enjoying it, give glory with Himself.<a name=140:9></a> We can count on Him for everything.<a name=140:10></a> He is good; nothing good will He withhold from those who walk before Him.<a name=140:11></a> The soul closes in the conscious feeling -- "Blessed is the man that trusts in thee.<a name=140:12></a>" And how true it is!<a name=140:13></a> Nothing can disturb, nothing is beyond His power -- nothing of which His love cannot take charge for us -- nothing which His wisdom does not know how to deal with for blessing.<a name=140:14></a> And the heart knows His love to count on it, and that blessed is the man that puts his trust in Him.<a name=140:15></a>

		Psalm 85 brings out a principle of great practical importance, the difference between the forgiveness of what belongs to our former state, and the blessedness into which the believer is introduced in the enjoyment of relationship with God.<a name=140:16></a> Here, of course, it is in the restoration of Israel to blessing in the land in accomplishment of the promises of Jehovah.<a name=140:17></a> I shall now speak only of the principle as regards ourselves.<a name=140:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Forgiveness is known as the fruit of Jehovah's goodness, and His sure goodness to His people, and hence full blessing is expected.<a name=140:19></a> But the two are distinct.<a name=140:20></a> So with us, forgiveness applies to all that we have done, looked at as in the old man and his deeds.<a name=140:21></a> We are brought back, and all the fruit of the old man is put away for ever by the sacrifice of Christ.<a name=140:22></a> We have thus full forgiveness.<a name=140:23></a> Wrath is gone as to it.<a name=140:24></a> All our sin is covered; but the distance from God and from the enjoyment of communion with Him is not removed.<a name=140:25></a> Fear of judgment and the Judge is gone; but the enjoyment of present blessing with God, His favour as upon those with whom is no question, and the going forth of divine favour in natural though righteous relationship, this is not entered into.<a name=140:26></a> joy there has been, great joy there is, in finding oneself forgiven but it applies to what we are in flesh, and is not communion with God in a nature capable of enjoying Him and none else, because coming from Him.<a name=140:27></a> Though forgiven, this distance, this want of enjoyment of God in the new and divine nature, is felt to be in its nature anger.<a name=140:28></a> It is not being brought to God.<a name=140:29></a> Nor can we rest without the enjoyment of His favour.<a name=140:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=141>[Page 141]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		For this the appeal in the psalm is made.<a name=141:1></a> The captivity of Jacob was brought back, but he looked for more, to be turned to God, and that all anger might cease.<a name=141:2></a> This is a large word; yet knowing love and communion at least in hope, we cannot rest without it.<a name=141:3></a> We may have desired it, that is, the sense of favour, but we cannot get it by progress or victory; we must get it by forgiveness and deliverance, for we are sinners.<a name=141:4></a> But when we have found there is redemption and pardon, there is then not merely the need of the conscience by which we must come in, but the spiritual desires of the new man.<a name=141:5></a> "Wilt thou not revive us again, that thy people may rejoice in thee?<a name=141:6></a>" The soul is revived by the presence of the Spirit of God, and rejoices in God Himself.<a name=141:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So Romans 5; we have peace with God: not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have received the reconciliation.<a name=141:8></a> "Shew us thy mercy, but mercy from God known in relationship with His own -- for us the Father known in Christ, "and grant us thy salvation.<a name=141:9></a>" But the soul has learnt grace and listens for the answer, because it looks for grace.<a name=141:10></a> It is not legal agony, but desired knowledge of God in favour.<a name=141:11></a> "He will speak peace.<a name=141:12></a>" "His salvation is nigh them that fear him.<a name=141:13></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this is all-important for the soul, not to rest in forgiveness (its first urgent necessity that applies to what it is as a sinner), but to understand that it is called to the enjoyment of God, in the cloudless communion of a new nature, which being, morally speaking, the divine nature, has necessary and full delight in God, though a dependent and growing delight -- we joy in God.<a name=141:14></a> No doubt it is and must be founded on righteousness -- divine righteousness, as we shall see.<a name=141:15></a> It would not be God, were it not so; but it is not the settling that point with a God who is calling it in question, but enjoying God's presence, communion with Him, according to the perfectness in which we have been placed before Him, enjoying Him in the divine nature of which we are partakers.<a name=141:16></a> This is thus spoken of in regard to Israel: "Mercy and truth are met together, righteousness and peace have kissed each other.<a name=141:17></a>"

		It is mercy, for it is granted to sinners in pure and sovereign mercy; but it is truth, for it accomplishes all God promises to Israel.<a name=142:1></a> To us far beyond promise, for there was none of the church; but it is a stronger case.<a name=142:2></a> It is being in Christ and as Christ, and so before God according to the favour in which He is before Him as risen.<a name=142:3></a> Righteousness seemed against the sinner and was; but through the divine righteousness it associates itself with peace to the sinner.<a name=142:4></a> They kiss each other.<a name=142:5></a> Peace answers to mercy, righteousness to truth.<a name=142:6></a> They have -- we have -- peace through mercy; but righteousness by the faith of Jesus Christ brings us into the full enjoyment of the place He is in, or it would not be righteousness.<a name=142:7></a> Truth springs out of the earth; that is, for Israel all promised is accomplished there.<a name=142:8></a> With us, of course, it is sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.<a name=142:9></a> It is not, "glory shall dwell in our land," but we are in title and place in the glory of God on high.<a name=142:10></a> But in all cases righteousness looks down from heaven.<a name=142:11></a><a href="#142:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> It is not for Israel or for us, righteousness looking up from earth to claim blessing from heaven.<a name=142:12></a> He has established righteousness in the very heavens.<a name=142:13></a> Christ is there.<a name=142:14></a> He is there by the righteousness of God.<a name=142:15></a> The righteousness was a divine heavenly righteousness; He, having glorified God, is glorified with God, and in Him, and this is divine righteousness.<a name=142:16></a> Our heavenly and Israel's earthly blessing both flow from it.<a name=142:17></a> Then comes conferred blessing too, and so surely it is all the produce of that heavenly country; its joys and privileges are made ours to enjoy.<a name=142:18></a>

		The last verse properly applies to earth.<a name=142:19></a> But there is a truth yet connected with this I have not noticed.<a name=142:20></a> The present government of God applies to this walking in divine enjoyment, not to forgiveness and peace.<a name=142:21></a> We enjoy this blessed communion, dwelling in God and God in us by the Holy Ghost given to us.<a name=142:22></a> If we grieve Him, we are made sorry, humbled, perhaps chastened.<a name=142:23></a> It is always our place; but its realisation and enjoyment depend on the revelations and action of the Holy Ghost in us, and these depend on our walk and state and obedience.<a name=142:24></a>

		So in John 14 and 15 the enjoyment of divine favour and blessedness is made to depend on the walk of the saint.<a name=143:1></a> It must, if it is by the Holy Ghost dwelling in us; for how should we be enjoying communion in love in the midst of evil or idle thoughts?<a name=143:2></a> The presence of the Holy Ghost depends on righteousness -- Christ's presence on high.<a name=143:3></a> The Spirit sheds God's love abroad in our hearts.<a name=143:4></a> We dwell in Him and He in us.<a name=143:5></a> But if evil is there, the flesh is at work, the Holy Ghost is grieved, communion is interrupted.<a name=143:6></a> It is not a question of title (that is settled: Christ is in heaven), but of enjoying the blessedness I am brought into, enjoying God.<a name=143:7></a> Here all our walk with God is in question, though it is by grace I do so walk aright.<a name=143:8></a> What I urge here is the soul's getting clear hold of the difference between forgiveness -- grace applied through Christ's work to sin and all the fruits of the old man -- and our introduction in Him in righteousness into the presence and communion of God where no cloud or question of sin ever comes.<a name=143:9></a> We may get out of this (not out of the title to it, but its enjoyment in spirit -- not that peace is destroyed with God, but communion), but in it no cloud of sin can come.<a name=143:10></a> We are loved as Christ is loved.<a name=143:11></a> All depends on His work.<a name=143:12></a> But one is the forgiveness of that out of which we have been brought, the application of Christ's work to our responsibility as children of Adam in flesh.<a name=143:13></a> In the other we are not in flesh, but in Christ, in the enjoyment of that into which He is entered -- our life for ever.<a name=143:14></a>

		On Psalm 88 I have not much to say.<a name=146:1></a> God is known and looked to according to His revealed name as the only Saviour, and it is just to this point that the soul is brought by the exercises spoken of in the psalm; cast by the pressure of all around to find it comes from God's hand, and, more yet, from God's judgment so as to be therein a pure and sovereign salvation from Him.<a name=146:2></a> "Jehovah, God of my salvation," governs the psalm.<a name=146:3></a> The state was this: affliction was present, nature could not find its account there, acquaintance put far from him, But this was but the negative and outward part, because nature found no relief, as it could from nature's sorrows more or less.<a name=146:4></a> The great point that pressed on the spirit was death and death bearing the witness of God's wrath upon it.<a name=146:5></a> To this the knowledge that the revealed God of promise was the only Saviour turns the heart; his life drew nigh to the grave.<a name=146:6></a> God's wrath lay hard upon Him.<a name=146:7></a> Still God was appealed to, It was nature without its sustainments, nature with death pressed on it, that is, its destruction and end.<a name=146:8></a> And God being brought in, and faith in Him, so far there as to own that all depended on Him, His wrath was felt in it all.<a name=146:9></a> And this is true.<a name=146:10></a> This is death when seen in its truth.<a name=146:11></a> So Christ saw it in Gethsemane, though He would not have said all that is in this psalm.<a name=146:12></a> So the convinced soul sees it, whose eye in its Adam state is opened upon God.<a name=146:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The psalm, however, does not look beyond this life.<a name=146:14></a> In this it ends in nature -- simple Judaism.<a name=146:15></a> But the faith in the revelation of God which has made it so feel what death is, as wrath from God, makes it look to Him who has inflicted it as a Saviour.<a name=146:16></a> And this is the value of such experience.<a name=146:17></a> It shews us our true state, our true relationship to God in nature.<a name=146:18></a> Nor is there a way of escape, for it is our state by judgment before God.<a name=146:19></a> Hence self is done with if we are delivered.<a name=146:20></a> This makes deliverance known as sovereign grace, as God's deliverance, and the soul rests on revelation.<a name=146:21></a> And until the deliverance the soul cries to God.<a name=146:22></a> And when deliverance is obtained, the flesh, all that it is, remains as a judged thing under wrath.<a name=146:23></a> There is no deception so far as to trust it really, though we may forget its evil for a moment, and even have to watch and contend with it.<a name=146:24></a> But its status before God is ever counted as a condemned and evil thing.<a name=146:25></a> The psalm is the description of the process which brings the soul to this.<a name=146:26></a> Sometimes the soul only reaches this on its death-bed.<a name=146:27></a> This ought not to be, but it explains what surprises many in godly persons.<a name=146:28></a> When it is not gone through really, the soul is not free.<a name=146:29></a> It stands, if free, on the ground of God's salvation; in spirit, not in flesh.<a name=146:30></a>

		It is not seeing this that has led many to live on experience, not on Christ.<a name=147:1></a> They speak of the Holy Ghost's work, and knowing the evil of the flesh, and the killing power of the law, which only means that they have not learned it.<a name=147:2></a> If they did, they would be dead to it.<a name=147:3></a> They are in this psalm.<a name=147:4></a> But they have not learned salvation and the gospel.<a name=147:5></a> They do not know that they are dead and risen with Christ.<a name=147:6></a> They are feeling death press upon them as wrath from God, according to this psalm -- all well but they have not received the sentence of death in themselves, through Christ's having died in grace for them, so as to reckon themselves dead, crucified with Christ, to be nevertheless alive, yet not they, but Christ living in them, who had died and put away all this for them.<a name=147:7></a> They are under the pressure of wrath for what they are in nature -- all true in its place -- but have not learned Christ, and through Him, that they are not in the flesh but in Christ, in that He has borne and passed through this for them; and that now, through Him, they are free in the new man as risen in Him.<a name=147:8></a>

		Psalm 89 has one remarkable character which it behoves us to notice here -- reliance on the faithfulness of God according to His original word of promise, when externally all is contrary to it, but the expectation of fulfilment founded on mercy, in fact on Christ, in whom all promised mercies concentrate themselves.<a name=147:9></a> "I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever, thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens.<a name=147:10></a>" The accomplishment of God's promises on earth shall be a source of praise for the inhabitants of heaven.<a name=147:11></a> Yet we see at the end that it was as if God had made all men in vain -- a sad thought -- the power of evil ruling, men its willing instruments, and the good having no place but reproach and sorrow.<a name=147:12></a> But God is called on to remember His saints' weakness and their reproach.<a name=147:13></a> Still there is confidence; and, whatever the state of things may be, He has wrought redemption, broken the power of the enemy; and has He not in a far better way than for Israel?<a name=147:14></a> His arm is mighty, His right hand high, whatever state they are in.<a name=147:15></a> Heaven and earth are His, though till Christ comes we cannot say Possessor of heaven and earth.<a name=147:16></a> Justice and judgment are the constant attributes of His throne.<a name=147:17></a> Mercy and truth announce Him when He goes forth.<a name=147:18></a> This form of expression is beautiful.<a name=147:19></a> God has a throne.<a name=147:20></a> There everything must be brought into consistency with it.<a name=147:21></a>

		But in His active going forth tender mercy and goodness announce Him, and faithful truth will tell His people He is there when He comes forth.<a name=148:1></a> His activities are mercy and faithfulness, because His will is at work and His nature is love.<a name=148:2></a> Yet His throne still maintains justice and judgment.<a name=148:3></a> How truly this has been shewn in Christ!<a name=148:4></a> -- will doubtless be so in the last days in Israel -- but signally so in Christ, and even then because of Him.<a name=148:5></a> This apprehension of God gives the sense of blessedness in the midst of sorrow.<a name=148:6></a> "Blessed are the people who know the joyful sound.<a name=148:7></a> They shall walk, O Lord, in the light of thy countenance.<a name=148:8></a> In thy name shall they rejoice all the day, and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted.<a name=148:9></a> For thou art the glory of their strength, and in thy favour shall our horn be exalted.<a name=148:10></a>" All this is realised in the heart in the midst of sorrows, so that it can be as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing.<a name=148:11></a> This gives sweet blessing to the heart of the saint.<a name=148:12></a> Trouble does but increase it, because it makes him feel the preciousness of the faithfulness and favour of God, and that nothing separates him from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.<a name=148:13></a> The inward revelation of divine favour makes the path of sorrow full of sweetness.<a name=148:14></a> So Christ Himself was a man of sorrows.<a name=148:15></a> Yet He could say that they might have "my joy fulfilled in themselves.<a name=148:16></a>"

		FOURTH BOOK -- PSALM 90-106
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Psalm 90 is in a special manner Israel's cry for mercy and restoration in the last days after their long affliction.<a name=149:1></a> But we will apply its principles as usual.<a name=149:2></a> It contemplates two things in the government of God; discipline, properly speaking, and satisfying mercy.<a name=149:3></a> But both are founded on another point: that God is the one unchangeable God -- the same before the world, with which discipline is connected, was created, as now, and now as then (time being as nothing to Him, which to us may seem so long); and that He is the dwelling -- place of His people, where is their rest and home and secure abode, whatever wanderings they may have.<a name=149:4></a> As to man in time, He sets man aside with a word, and restores him.<a name=149:5></a> They are like grass growing up and then withering.<a name=149:6></a> But though this be true, if we compare God and man, yet faith gets hold both of the ways and purposes of God in dealing with His people.<a name=149:7></a> For Israel it is felt as wrath, because they do not yet know reconciliation.<a name=149:8></a> We know it is love, but the truth of the dealing is the same, and we can apply it.<a name=149:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And first as to ways: "as his fear, so is his wrath.<a name=149:10></a>" It is not arbitrary, but according to His own nature and character.<a name=149:11></a> Fear is knowing Him in truth, so that what He is is applied to the holy judgment of all that is in the soul, so that nothing should displease Him or hinder communion.<a name=149:12></a> Now wrath as discipline -- governmental displeasure -- is the expression of this as regards the state of the soul, where it has been unheeded, or the will has been in it.<a name=149:13></a> It makes good God's character as regards that which is opposed to it in us.<a name=149:14></a> Faith, divine teaching, shews us that His wrath is as His fear.<a name=149:15></a> But when the will bows, our very feebleness becomes, not terror, but a motive in our appeal to God.<a name=149:16></a> And He owns it.<a name=149:17></a> He considers whereof we are made, and remembers we are but dust.<a name=149:18></a> But when once we feel our nothingness, and apply our hearts to wisdom, the beginning of which is the fear of Jehovah, instead of God's having to enforce it by subduing our will, and correcting our carelessness, the heart gets courage, gets bold.<a name=149:19></a> It is not reasoning, but by grace confidence is restored, and the heart says, "Return; O Lord, how long?<a name=149:20></a>"

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=150>[Page 150]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this, we have often seen, is the expression of faith.<a name=150:1></a> God purposes to bless, and in result will bless His people; and hence, when under pressure, faith can say, How long?<a name=150:2></a> Self is not faith, and the fear of God must be produced; but where faith is, it springs up again into the sense of known mercy and says, How long?<a name=150:3></a> And, note, there is known mercy.<a name=150:4></a> It is not "come," but "return"; not as if God had left them (though, as to His ways, it is true as to Israel -- He hides His face from the house of Jacob), but we look to His returning in the sense of known present mercies and enjoyment of favour.<a name=150:5></a> Then it brightens up into full confidence.<a name=150:6></a> Faith knows His purpose is to bless, to give delight and joy to His people, and that by His own favour.<a name=150:7></a> It knows He delights in them; it counts on this: "Satisfy us early.<a name=150:8></a>" What a bold word with God!<a name=150:9></a> But it is confidence now; the soul is morally restored in His love which He delights in.<a name=150:10></a> This is looked at as constant too.<a name=150:11></a> "Rejoice and be glad all our days," it says.<a name=150:12></a> Why should it not expect it from the God of goodness?<a name=150:13></a> It may be more outwardly with Israel, still the spirit of it is right.<a name=150:14></a> It looks for a refraining God; one who takes account of the sorrow of His people, though He has been bound to inflict it.<a name=150:15></a> See how beautifully and blessedly this is put, Isaiah 40 (just what is sought here), 'Speak to the heart of Jerusalem; tell her, her time of trouble is accomplished, for she has received at the hand of the Lord double of all her sins.<a name=150:16></a>' His heart counted it twice, the chastisement needed, compared with her sins; for the answer to faith is ever more than the request.<a name=150:17></a> (See the prayers and answers in Psalm 132.<a name=150:18></a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But faith, looking on the thoughts and purposes of God in blessing, goes beyond returning and refraining mercies.<a name=150:19></a> God has purposes in His love and works in its accomplishment; hence they say, Not only satisfy us with thy mercy, but "Let thy work appear unto thy servants.<a name=150:20></a>" God's own work will make good blessing, and so how good it will be!<a name=150:21></a> And it will be manifested to their honour and delight.<a name=150:22></a> So we, even for our souls; we seek not only restoring mercy, but thereon the positive work of God in producing blessing, in bringing us yet nearer to Himself it is never then merely restoration; it is a soul better able to appreciate God, and God more fully revealed to it.<a name=150:23></a> Yet still awaiting, knowing as we are known, the result in the full display of glory (I speak here of children, because it is literally for Israel in the millennium); but we do look for the complete work of God in raising and glorifying us, and then entering into glory to abide.<a name=150:24></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But another sweet thought is added to this "Let the beauty of Jehovah, our God, be upon us.<a name=151:1></a>" Their thoughts would hardly go beyond the manifest endowment of blessing from His own hand marking them His.<a name=151:2></a> With us how fully is it so!<a name=151:3></a> Shall not we be in the glory of Christ Himself?<a name=151:4></a> like Him arrayed in this blessed likeness before God our Father, a place of perfect delight!<a name=151:5></a> Nor do I exclude present blessing, how we may be as thus under grace as the lign -- aloes which the Lord had planted; and that was when Israel were abiding in their tents.<a name=151:6></a> So the church should be a spectacle of grace, to the angels, of order and beauty, and the life of Jesus as manifested in the individual believer.<a name=151:7></a> In this case too the works of our hands under divine favour are established for us.<a name=151:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Psalm 91.<a name=151:9></a> On this beautiful psalm, of the structure of which I have spoken elsewhere, I have not much to say, because it defines the names of God which are available, and the specific effects of faith going on even to what is directly applicable to Christ; so that the general principle is less justly deducible from or connected with it.<a name=151:10></a> It would be reducing what is purposely specific to what is vague.<a name=151:11></a> It takes Jehovah, as such, as God; and so he who owns that name, comes under the care of El-shaddai for a specific performance of earthly promises in the ways of God.<a name=151:12></a> This is not our place: one who acted on it would deceive himself.<a name=151:13></a> Yet a general faith, and trust of heart founded on it, would surely be blessed.<a name=151:14></a> It does not take up a Father's chastenings with which the government of God connects itself.<a name=151:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here, in trusting Jehovah, no evil comes nigh the dwelling of him who does so.<a name=151:16></a> This was what made it strange to Asaph till he went into the sanctuary of God.<a name=151:17></a> He saw the wicked prospering, himself plagued every moment, This is the certain result of owning Jehovah, when the government of God does come in.<a name=151:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Still we may learn some of the characters of trust.<a name=151:19></a> It is not merely the knowledge that there is an Almighty God, who is above all things: the secret place of His true revelation of Himself must be known.<a name=151:20></a> This, true faith has, and confers with God there according to it.<a name=151:21></a> His name is revealed to faith.<a name=151:22></a> To us it is Christ as Lord, and the Father.<a name=151:23></a> Faith thus, in its confession of His name, makes its refuge and strong tower, and moreover trusts in it: a great thing, for no power of evil, no cause of distress can be anything to upset the mind, if the Lord be looked to and trusted in.<a name=151:24></a> It has here the promise of ever watchful and protecting care.<a name=151:25></a> This is true whatever outward evil may come.<a name=151:26></a>

		As we see in Luke 21: 16-18, the Lord says some of them should be put to death, but not a hair of their head should perish -- they were all counted.<a name=152:1></a> Providential power is all at God's disposal.<a name=152:2></a> Faith is identified with the interests of God's people (verse 9); but the Lord's own name is what has governed the heart, and the true name of God is known to it: that is, as I have said, the true revelation of God Himself known by divine teaching.<a name=152:3></a> To us it is Christ Himself, and the Father in Him.<a name=152:4></a> Faith calls.<a name=152:5></a> It is not merely passive trust, right as this is in its place, but it communicates with God about its needs, because it trusts Him.<a name=152:6></a> God's presence is there for faith and the exercise of its power; and this is as true now, in its just application, as then, as hereafter.<a name=152:7></a> The way is different, because the object is different, that is, to bring in a heavenly state.<a name=152:8></a> It brings present blessing though with persecution, and is assured of eternal and heavenly salvation.<a name=152:9></a>

		Psalm 92 is really praise for the final deliverance of Israel, and Jehovah's millennial name is the key to it, as of the last; as the following psalms are the bringing in again of the only begotten.<a name=152:10></a> There is one principle to note in it -- the elevation of the wicked is finally for their destruction.<a name=152:11></a> The man untaught of God does not see this; but faith discerns in its adversaries and the power of evil which arises up and presses on it, darkening its horizon, the enemies of the Lord.<a name=152:12></a> Hence, though tried more than another, for the power of evil is very painful to it, it has confidence.<a name=152:13></a> For though it would be foreign to the Christian to wish personally for vengeance (and we have to watch against this), is it so to the Christian to rejoice in the earth being delivered from the power of the wicked?<a name=152:14></a> On the contrary, "Rejoice now, ye prophets and ye holy apostles.<a name=152:15></a>" Faith gives a keen sense of the evil, because it is such and hostile to God and goodness and truth, and rejoices in the righteous judgment.<a name=152:16></a> But it is as the Lord's work, as the work of His hands, it rejoices in it; and that is perfect.<a name=152:17></a> judgment displays too the uprightness of the Lord, but faith must wait in patience.<a name=152:18></a> The following psalms discuss and celebrate the coming in of this judgment.<a name=152:19></a>

		But this is not quite all.<a name=153:11></a> Faith has that on which it rests -- the Lord's testimonies: they are very sure.<a name=153:12></a> God's word may be counted on as Himself, not only for final deliverance but for guidance along the path of difficulty.<a name=153:13></a> Nor is this all.<a name=153:14></a> There is a character which is a safeguard against delusion and a means of judging and discerning the right path: "Holiness becometh thine house.<a name=153:15></a>" Oh!<a name=153:16></a> how these two principles do cheer and enlighten us in our path.<a name=153:17></a> How they strengthen us in the consciousness that it is of God's very nature, and cannot but be!<a name=153:18></a> Thus God's testimonies and God's holiness secure and fix the heart as to that which is of God.<a name=153:19></a> If the water-floods rise up, the Lord's power will settle all in His own judgment.<a name=153:20></a>

		On Psalms 93-101, though they are very striking ones, I have very little to say with my present object, because they treat not of the exercises of the heart in the time of trial, but of the coming in of power to put an end to that time.<a name=153:21></a> They are characterised by the title "Jehovah reigns, the world is established.<a name=153:22></a>" I have therefore only a few remarks to make: first, that the result of all this patience of government in God is, that man rises up as the water-floods against Him: but God is mightier.<a name=153:23></a> The termination of it is by power.<a name=153:24></a>

		But there is another thing -- Jehovah has a house, a dwelling.<a name=154:1></a> Take it as His heavenly dwelling, His temple where all speak of His glory, or in its place as the church, His habitation by the Spirit: it is always essentially characterised by one thing, because it is His habitation -- holiness becomes His house for ever, separation to Him according to His nature.<a name=154:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These two points guide the saint through all circumstances till power comes in to sustain him, because he counts on God, through all the risings up of the power of evil: the word of God and the holiness of His nature.<a name=154:3></a> God has graciously communicated His mind to men, has spoken.<a name=154:4></a> His word remains sure, come what will.<a name=154:5></a> That is inherent to His nature, depends on His power as God.<a name=154:6></a> His speaking obliges Himself, so to speak, by His nature.<a name=154:7></a> I cannot believe He is God at all if, when He has spoken, it is not made good.<a name=154:8></a> He would not be God.<a name=154:9></a> "Hath he said and shall he not do it?<a name=154:10></a> hath he spoken and shall it not come to pass?<a name=154:11></a>" If He be God, truth to make it good cannot fail, nor power, or He is not God.<a name=154:12></a> It would be ignorance, or some one else would have power to hinder Him.<a name=154:13></a> His testimonies are sure.<a name=154:14></a> In the midst of evil this is an immense, a perfect, consolation and stay.<a name=154:15></a>

		Psalm 107.<a name=164:1></a> In the last book of psalms we find, besides many songs of praise, all the moral circumstances of Israel on their return to blessing.<a name=164:2></a> The first psalm in it stamps this character on it, It looks at them as gathered back, but traces the various scenes through which they might have passed, and that after their entry into the land too, and God's ways with them in it.<a name=164:3></a> It is a description of toils and trials, in which the Lord was looked to, and answered and interfered in behalf of the tossed and tried soul, and men are exhorted to own and praise Him.<a name=164:4></a> It carried this blessed truth in the forefront: His mercy endures for ever.<a name=164:5></a> God's unchanging love and goodness, celebrated from the first fully proved failure of Israel onward.<a name=164:6></a> Man fails, God's mercy to His people does not.<a name=164:7></a> It is His redeemed and gathered ones who are the people that have to bear witness to this.<a name=164:8></a> Strangers and pilgrims where there was no resting-place, no home, hungry and thirsty, their soul fainting in them, they cried to the Lord and were led in a right way to where their foot and heart found rest.<a name=164:9></a>

		Two characters are given to the soul in this condition.<a name=164:10></a> It is a longing soul and a hungry soul.<a name=164:11></a> We have craving and want, but these brought before the Lord.<a name=164:12></a> This is mercy.<a name=164:13></a> It is not the case of holy desires here, but God meeting wants.<a name=164:14></a> The wearied and fainting soul wants, but this want turns into a cry to the Lord.<a name=164:15></a> Mercy is surely there.<a name=164:16></a> But this might be even where their affliction and distress was chastisement, and the fruit of rebellion.<a name=164:17></a> But here where the heart turned to the Lord, mercy met it, and there was deliverance.<a name=164:18></a> The gates of brass and iron which shut them in are broken, where iniquity and the folly of departure from the Lord had brought it all on.<a name=164:19></a> He sent His word that they might be healed, and so delivered.<a name=164:20></a> When men were venturesome and braved dangers and found themselves at their wits' end through the storm of the sea which gives no footing to them, the Lord comes in and gives peace and leads them to the haven of their desire.<a name=164:21></a> In the very place of the habitation of His people, in the place of promises, there His direct government comes in.<a name=164:22></a> Rivers are a wilderness, a fruitful land barren, through judgment: turning the wilderness into pools of water, judging wickedness and shewing mercy to the needy soul, satisfying the hungry who lean on Him.<a name=164:23></a> Careless and lifted up even there, they are brought down.<a name=164:24></a> He pours contempt on princes, but the poor and needy He sets on high.<a name=164:25></a> It is not the order of a world blessed of God where evil is not, but the government of God where evil is, where God overrules the evil to the purposes of His own government, to hide pride from man, and comfort and encourage the poor in spirit who look to Him, who trust not in pride and human strength and will rest in the Lord.<a name=164:26></a> In all the ways too where their will has brought them, where their sins even have brought them, if He be looked to, His mercy and goodness are found.<a name=164:27></a>

		One or two brief remarks on Psalm 108, but on a point of great beauty.<a name=165:8></a> There is great confidence here, and, as ever, mercy to the soul which knows itself and comes before God in truth.<a name=165:9></a> But then, for its own deliverance and blessing, it looks to the exalting of God.<a name=165:10></a> This shews it must be a holy, righteous exalting.<a name=165:11></a> "Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens, and thy glory above all the earth, that thy beloved may be delivered.<a name=165:12></a>" It is a blessed thought, and this is what faith has to lay hold of now, even in the time of trial, that our blessing and God's glory are one, only we must put His glory first.<a name=165:13></a> This is the very principle of uprightness -- "He that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true," says Christ, "and there is no unrighteousness in him" -- and the highest blessing.<a name=165:14></a> So Jesus Himself, "What shall I say?<a name=165:15></a> Father save me from this hour .<a name=165:16></a>.<a name=165:17></a>.<a name=165:18></a> Father, glorify thy name.<a name=165:19></a>" Then comes, "I, if I be lifted up, shall draw all men unto me.<a name=165:20></a>" So in trial and even in evil, faith identifies the glory of God and His people.<a name=165:21></a> "The Egyptians will hear of it .<a name=165:22></a>.<a name=165:23></a>.<a name=165:24></a> .<a name=165:25></a> What wilt thou do to thy great name?<a name=165:26></a>"

		In Psalm 118 we are still on the ground of final blessing, so that the government of God in the midst of trial is only referred to in the past.<a name=172:8></a> It is Israel's recognition of the divine ways and of Christ Himself when blessing is come, owning that Jehovah's mercy has lasted out all their ways and endured for ever.<a name=172:9></a> I notice only the aspect of circumstances as applicable to us at all times.<a name=172:10></a> God is for His people; but men, all men, may be against them.<a name=172:11></a> One has only to trust the Lord, and victory remains with faith.<a name=172:12></a> But in this, where evil has to be governmentally corrected, Satan also seeks, Satan has, his part.<a name=172:13></a> How truly it was so in leading all men against Christ; how fully so in the last days of Antichrist's power, I need not say; but as the book of Job shews, it is so in the various chastenings of God.<a name=172:14></a> Evil on the conscience, or even unconsciously in the heart, gives him a handle, sometimes a terrible one, against the soul even where it is upright.<a name=172:15></a> Rest is found only in self-judgment and confession of what gives him a handle.<a name=172:16></a> Satan would seek to make us fall thus; but behind all this the hand of God is to be seen, as in Job's case.<a name=172:17></a> "Thou hast chastened me sore, but thou hast not given me over unto death.<a name=172:18></a>" It is for blessing.<a name=172:19></a> One only could declare "The prince of this world cometh and hath nothing in me"; but with us, all is love and blessing to make us know ourselves, and then enjoy His blessing (compare Deuteronomy 8), and fully own what Christ is according to His victory and glory in the counsels of God.<a name=172:20></a> We must be thus exercised, the ground ploughed and harrowed, but the result is, "this is the day which the Lord hath made.<a name=172:21></a>" No doubt this is the final blessing of the earth when Christ comes, but in every exercise of a soul brought to the point of uprightness with God, the principle is made good; the gates of righteousness into the joy of communion, so to speak, are opened.<a name=172:22></a> And the mercy to which we had no title we own to be the Lord's doing, and all is light.<a name=172:23></a> The direct application to the remnant is evidently the just application of the psalm, but we connect this great display of God's government with the details in which it applies to us.<a name=172:24></a>

		Psalm 119 is the expression of the effect of the law written in the heart of Israel, when they had long erred from God's ways and were sorrowing under the effects of it.<a name=173:1></a> It is one of the psalms which pronounces blessedness.<a name=173:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We will examine some of the elements of this work in the heart.<a name=173:3></a> This blessedness is pronounced on "the undefiled in the way.<a name=173:4></a>" The world is full of defilement.<a name=173:5></a> There is only one path in the world (for ours is out of it, we are pilgrims and strangers following Christ who is gone on high; but only one in the world) which can be undefiled; that is, God's law.<a name=173:6></a> It is not what is heavenly formed within, affections set on things above, a walking in the Spirit; this no doubt will produce fruits which no law of God will condemn.<a name=173:7></a> It is the way wholly formed of God's expressed will for man's walk in this world.<a name=173:8></a> They "walk in the law of Jehovah.<a name=173:9></a>" There is a delight in what is right, in what is not defiled by sin or the world; but what is in walking in the law.<a name=173:10></a> It is a perfect rule, according to God, in this world for a living man.<a name=173:11></a> But this is carried farther in the heart.<a name=173:12></a> It looks to the source.<a name=173:13></a> God has borne witness to His will, and shewed that He would have man walk in it, and the heart turns to it, not only as undefiled and right, but as "His testimonies.<a name=173:14></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		This connects itself with the desire after Himself.<a name=174:1></a> They seek him with the whole heart.<a name=174:2></a> This is the general character of the effect of the law written in the heart.<a name=174:3></a> The practical effect is evident: they "do no iniquity.<a name=174:4></a>" Not only the heart is set morally right in undefiledness, but evil or unrighteousness, relative wrong, is not done.<a name=174:5></a> Instead of their own will and puffing, as it is said, at God, "they walk in his ways.<a name=174:6></a>" The authority of God is recognised in the heart, with diligence in acquiescence in it, and the desires of the heart are towards it.<a name=174:7></a> "O that my ways were directed," etc.<a name=174:8></a> It is not only the perception of God's ways -- what is intrinsically approved in the heart; but the desire that the actual course of life were ordered so as to keep God's statutes; not satisfying our will, or our will being towards God's.<a name=174:9></a> And here dependence is felt as to the course of a man's life, and there is the desire it may be directed.<a name=174:10></a> Conscience and spiritual discernment go together.<a name=174:11></a> Shame does not flow from man's disapprobation; but from the conscience not being good according to God's revealed will.<a name=174:12></a> But this way is complete and an only one.<a name=174:13></a> Whatever is out of it is not undefiled -- is the world, which is abhorrent from God; we must be in it in will, heart, and way, or out of it, and so ashamed, if the will of the heart be right.<a name=174:14></a> If my mind and soul have morally discerned the excellency of God's way, the conscience, if I am out of it in every respect, makes me ashamed.<a name=174:15></a> The heart set right has respect to "all God's commandments.<a name=174:16></a>" But where this is, not only the conscience is right and peaceful, but the heart is set free.<a name=174:17></a> "I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have learned thy righteous judgments.<a name=174:18></a>" There is knowledge of God through His ways, and the heart restored to Him, and having learned His thoughts (not only commandments, but His judgments), can praise Him not merely for benefits but in the heart's association with Himself.<a name=174:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another element of this state is full will and purpose of heart to obey and keep what God has ordained or appointed, what has God's authority attached to it, not merely moral right and wrong.<a name=174:20></a> But it was a time when Israel had erred; hence here there is a special looking to God not utterly to give them up.<a name=174:21></a> We see thus that the form of this psalm cannot apply to the Christian.<a name=174:22></a> He never expects to be utterly forsaken; in a particular course he may apply this, when he is conscious of having followed his own will.<a name=174:23></a> But from the general principle we may learn much, as that which is wrought in the heart as regards its moral disposition.<a name=174:24></a> Verses 1-8.<a name=174:25></a>

		But there are other points practically.<a name=175:1></a> The tendency of man's energy, as such, is to follow his own will.<a name=175:2></a> This is now natural, not before the fall.<a name=175:3></a> Then man enjoyed, thanked, and blessed; he followed naturally in the path described by God -- a simple one.<a name=175:4></a> Now, through that first distrust of God, will is come in.<a name=175:5></a> And here we have a difference of the very last importance in Christian obedience and the law.<a name=175:6></a> The law addresses itself, as such, to responsible man down here, without raising the question of and not supposing a new nature, though it may discover (when known to be spiritual) the need of one.<a name=175:7></a> It supposes a will and lusts which have to be checked and put down.<a name=175:8></a> The Old Testament does not speak of flesh and spirit, but of responsible men and their ways.<a name=175:9></a> Christian obedience is as Christ's; the will of God is the motive of action, not merely the rule.<a name=175:10></a> "I come to do thy will": no doubt it will herein be a rule to guide us.<a name=175:11></a> In us this is a new nature, Christ being our life.<a name=175:12></a> We do not find in the Old Testament "he cannot sin because he is born of God.<a name=175:13></a>" It is not that there was not the desire to obey in renewed souls then; surely there was.<a name=175:14></a> It could not be otherwise.<a name=175:15></a> But the relationship in which men stood to God was a law without them to govern their ways when in flesh, not a known new nature standing in the results of redemption whose only motive of action was God's will.<a name=175:16></a> The prophets, indeed, pointed out Christ as such (as in Psalm 40), and the masters in Israel should have known that, to have their future privileges, they must be born of water and the Spirit; as in Ezekiel 36.<a name=175:17></a> But obedience under the law was a rule applied to one who had a will whose movements were to be judged by the law, not a nature whose only motive was God's will, standing in the power of redemption so as to have the right to reckon a discovered old man to be dead, yea, whom God had pronounced dead through Christ.<a name=175:18></a> Hence the heirs differed nothing from servants, to do this and that, whatever their own will might be.<a name=175:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ways, and not nature, were in question, even though renewal of heart were there.<a name=175:20></a> Hence the young man, where energy of will is found, is to "cleanse his way.<a name=175:21></a>" Lusts would have carried his will elsewhere: how should he find the means of having his ways clear before God?<a name=175:22></a> Watchfulness, the fear of God (not will) according to God's word.<a name=175:23></a> God's word -- how precious to have it in such a world of darkness and will, to guide our feet in a path according to God's mind!<a name=175:24></a> For the heart is set right.<a name=175:25></a> It is not, indeed, the sweet enjoyment of love in a reconciled soul, love shed abroad in the heart by the Holy Ghost given, but (what is of all vital importance) the heart right in the sight of God.<a name=175:26></a> It supposes the man away from God, but undivided in his desire.<a name=175:27></a> Both are true of the Christian.<a name=175:28></a> He is reconciled and has peaceful affections in perfect relationship (this one under the law had not); and he has earnest desire after Him that has loved him, as known and seen in glory, only as knowing (not merely seeking) Him.<a name=175:29></a> Here He is "sought with the whole heart"; no guile but the true desire of the heart towards God.<a name=175:30></a> Being so (the commandments of God being precious, as making known His will), the true heart prays not to be let to wander from them.<a name=175:31></a> God is looked to in goodness; for when He is truly sought, there is always some sense of His goodness.<a name=175:32></a> It is what distinguishes conversion from mere terror of conscience, desire towards Him and sense of goodness in God.<a name=175:33></a>

		We have, then, another element.<a name=176:1></a> The heart which thus seeks God, and has a desire to do His will, not only seeks outward conduct to be right when the occasion arises, but keeps the word at the centre, so to speak, and springs of action.<a name=176:2></a> He hides it in his own heart as that which he loves; "out of the heart (where that word is hid) are the issues of life.<a name=176:3></a>" How large a place the word has here!<a name=176:4></a> Note, too, man's estimate of conduct disappears.<a name=176:5></a> It is between God and the heart, and this is integrity of heart.<a name=176:6></a> It is not here a single eye to an object; so far as that is here, it is found in seeking with the whole heart.<a name=176:7></a> This is the integrity which, by reason of the desire towards God, takes His mind as governing the springs of life.<a name=176:8></a> It is a blessed and important principle.<a name=176:9></a> The word hid in the heart prevents sinning against Him.<a name=176:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the heart goes farther.<a name=176:11></a> It owns the blessedness of Jehovah Himself, known in His ways, His goodness, His mercy, that endureth for ever.<a name=176:12></a> There, in the midst of its distress, the renewed heart finds its resource and its rest.<a name=176:13></a> "Blessed art thou, O Jehovah.<a name=176:14></a>" This makes the heart look for what He has decreed and ordained, and for divine teaching in it.<a name=176:15></a> This looking at God gives courage and the consciousness of integrity and faithfulness.<a name=176:16></a> When the heart is right, this is the case.<a name=176:17></a> The heart, however humble, when it walks in integrity, has the consciousness of it before God.<a name=176:18></a> It may see weakness and infirmity in its ways, shortcomings of which it will judge the cause; but with God it will have the consciousness of entire guilelessness and purpose of heart.<a name=176:19></a> "This one thing I do"; "to me to live is Christ.<a name=176:20></a>" This does not affect humility; entire dependence on grace and divine strength for willing and doing is felt (we are in result unprofitable servants, had we done all), it is duty and delight.<a name=176:21></a> But there is the joyfulness with and from God that the heart is right.<a name=176:22></a>

		Service flows from confidence in God and knowledge of His blessedness with the value we have of what God has given.<a name=177:1></a> So Christ fully in Psalm 40.<a name=177:2></a> The spirit is the same here.<a name=177:3></a> It is the effect of perception of divine things, in power and value for them, to make us declare them.<a name=177:4></a> It is glorifying God.<a name=177:5></a> Love to others may accompany this, but it is another thing.<a name=177:6></a> We owe it to God to declare what He is.<a name=177:7></a> He ought to be known, and what He is owned.<a name=177:8></a> The difference of praise is that the sense of what He is, is addressed to Himself.<a name=177:9></a> Perfection is where He is fully known, so that there is no need to declare it to others; all with one mind worship because of it.<a name=177:10></a> Then we hold nothing back, "all the judgments of thy mouth.<a name=177:11></a>" We are filled with what God is, its value; and it is uttered.<a name=177:12></a> We may be wise for others' sake, but God is sufficiently valued to be fully declared.<a name=177:13></a> God's testimonies become the riches of the soul.<a name=177:14></a> The possession of heaven somewhat modifies this; yet still, for here below, the way of God's testimonies are joy, moral joy, as riches would be to men.<a name=177:15></a> But there is an inward life, which occupies itself with these things, as well as the activity of duty; much to be fed on, digested, learnt in God's testimonies.<a name=177:16></a> We meditate on them; we have thus God's mind -- the Holy Ghost's intention in them.<a name=177:17></a> Thus the soul is fed in delight.<a name=177:18></a> But God's ways are held in respect as authority to the mind.<a name=177:19></a> The heart goes with them too.<a name=177:20></a> It is not merely that they delight his soul, but there is the activity of the new man; he delights himself with them, he makes it the matter of his occupation, seeking his enjoyment there, and keeps it (oh!<a name=177:21></a> how needed it is) in memory, the true proof of affection.<a name=177:22></a> Vers.<a name=177:23></a> 9-16.<a name=177:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		From the third division, another element comes in.<a name=177:25></a> Its literal application is to the sorrows of Israel in the last days in principle it applies to all times -- the sorrows and trials which accompany godliness.<a name=177:26></a> The soul looks for mercy from One that is supreme, where it is a stranger.<a name=177:27></a> It needs this to keep the law.<a name=177:28></a> No doubt it may be strengthened even to martyrdom; but in general it looks for mercy to be able to walk.<a name=177:29></a> The heart owns it, is God's servant, and looks to be kept in mercy in order to walk truly.<a name=177:30></a> This is a great point of the return of the soul to God.<a name=177:31></a> By this fact God has now His own place and authority as such.<a name=177:32></a> Whatever evil may be permitted (compare Psalm 94), God, our God, is supreme; and, further, goodness is always then necessarily known to Him.<a name=177:33></a>

		But there is more; the soul thus knowing God desires the knowledge of His mind, not merely a rule to direct but "wondrous things out of God's law.<a name=178:1></a>" And all this gives the consciousness of being a stranger in the earth.<a name=178:2></a> A good God (whose servants we are), and an evil world, make a man "a stranger" (we are much more through Christ).<a name=178:3></a> We need these -- our own moral delights -- God's commandments; we must add the fulness of Christ.<a name=178:4></a> "They are not of the world, as I am not of the world.<a name=178:5></a> Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.<a name=178:6></a>" And here the heart is fully engaged and filled; "my soul breaketh" forth, for there is infinite delight in the new nature, in the fulness of God's revelations.<a name=178:7></a> It does break forth with delight.<a name=178:8></a> But this delight in the word gives a just estimate of man in the world, the "proud" man acting from his own will and setting himself up.<a name=178:9></a> He may seem to succeed and puff at God.<a name=178:10></a> He is under a curse, he errs from the one true way of man -- God's way.<a name=178:11></a> The exaltation of will brings necessary curse; for we are thus away from, in rebellion against, God -- all acting of human will is.<a name=178:12></a> But godliness does more than make a stranger, a sure thing for the heart, it brings cruet mockings, for proud man will not have subjection to God; it is contemptible to man; and the reasoner he cannot help Him, he boasts.<a name=178:13></a> That is not contemptible, his will is in it.<a name=178:14></a> But with God, man must be subject, and the wilful despise this, though often with misgivings of heart.<a name=178:15></a> This the saint, while enduring, seeks to be removed.<a name=178:16></a> God should assert His title, not suffer the faithful to be pressed down by evil.<a name=178:17></a> Still, meanwhile, he can retreat into his own delights; he meditates in God's statutes, hid there from the pride of man.<a name=178:18></a> They are his delight, and his counsellors too.<a name=178:19></a> Vers.<a name=178:20></a> 17-24.<a name=178:21></a>

		He who seeks to follow God's ways will find himself often in evil days -- days when the power of evil prevails and presses upon his spirit.<a name=179:1></a> What then marks faithfulness is, that the heart does not turn aside to an easier path or other comforts, but looks to God and His raising up the heart according to His word.<a name=179:2></a> There his heart is.<a name=179:3></a> He prefers sorrow with it to leaving it, but has learnt to trust God, and in the sorrow looks to relief according to this revelation of God; and God can be counted on for it.<a name=179:4></a> The heart had been true with God -- not only knew that He knew all its ways, but that there was the desire of being right in His sight and confidence with God even there.<a name=179:5></a> He had declared His ways.<a name=179:6></a>

		There are three points in this section.<a name=193:19></a> He is fully in the presence of the power of evil, his regard is to Jehovah Himself; the energy of evil in its moral character only attached him increasedly to God's word and testimonies.<a name=193:20></a> This is the effect of nearness to God, because His presence keeps the heart free and confident, and maintains the sense of value for what is in the word.<a name=193:21></a> There is, I think, progress here.<a name=193:22></a>

		We have David brought before us as the great dispensational root and characteristic consequently of the blessing, but the house is -- the subject, a dwelling-place for the mighty One of Jacob, Hence also it is not wilderness blessings.<a name=206:15></a> It is not, "Rise up, Jehovah, and let thine enemies be scattered"; and, "Return, O Jehovah, to the many thousands of Israel," Numbers 10: 3, 5, 6.<a name=206:16></a> It is, "Arise, O Jehovah, into thy rest, thou and the ark of thy strength.<a name=206:17></a>" It is Zion which is God's rest for ever.<a name=206:18></a> This it is He has chosen; there He will make the horn of David to bud.<a name=206:19></a> The person of David's Son, royal grace in Zion, is thus what characterises the blessing.<a name=206:20></a> Whatever house is built, David and his trouble are remembered, not Solomon, the typical son of David and his house.<a name=206:21></a> In truth Solomon's faith was personally every way inferior.<a name=206:22></a> He went to Gibeon, not to Zion; to the empty tabernacle, not to the ark until afterwards.<a name=206:23></a> David's heart was on the house.<a name=206:24></a> It was all right.<a name=206:25></a> But God built his as He replied to him.<a name=206:26></a> It is the personal grace of Christ that is the centre of all, and the faith that, when the outward blessing was not yet there in peace, formed the true link with God.<a name=206:27></a>

		And now note the principles.<a name=207:20></a> The afflictions of faith are the true path of blessing.<a name=207:21></a> A rest for God is the desire of the new nature; for sin, disorder only, has disturbed that rest, and, note, that rest which has its place in His relationship with His creatures, for in Himself He ever rests; but He must rest in holiness and love, in the state of the creatures, with whom He has to do, being according to His mind and love.<a name=207:22></a> This the heart desires.<a name=207:23></a> It is <i>God's</i> rest, nor can the heart rest till then.<a name=207:24></a> But this is according to the manner of His presence; in Israel covenant-promise and governmental glory; for us our Father's house, God's rest according to His own nature, holy and without blame before Him in love, and in glory.<a name=207:25></a> That is in the Beloved, the true David, the Anointed, the Christ -- this both secures and gives the true character of the blessedness in, with, and like Him.<a name=207:26></a>

		But, note, that simplicity of faith, its proper energy, leaning not on the past which is ruined or to be forgotten, but on what is before us as its object, and on our only dependence, on divine leading as to it -- simplicity of faith, wrought as it is by God, leads into the place of God's desire and God's election.<a name=208:1></a> David brought the ark to Zion, but Zion God had chosen, had desired for His habitation.<a name=208:2></a> This in us is identified with a new creature, being made partakers of the divine nature, In this faith lives and acts and judges.<a name=208:3></a> It is in the saint a new nature, living on Christ as its object and food.<a name=208:4></a> And it learns and knows the place of God's rest herein.<a name=208:5></a> For David and Zion are really identified each in its own way with one another.<a name=208:6></a> Thus our new nature, God's desire, God's election, God's rest, and Christ Himself all coincide.<a name=208:7></a>

		PRACTICAL REFLECTIONS ON THE PROVERBS

		The Proverbs refer us directly to the government of God on the earth, more entirely, because they are less prophetic, than even the Psalms.<a name=224:1></a> Prophecy, referring to Christ and the remnant, necessarily looked to His rejection and that of some of them from the earth, and hence, though dimly, brought in light from beyond; telling us at least of the resurrection and ascension of Christ and His session at the right hand of God, to go no farther.<a name=224:2></a> The Proverbs do not enter on such topics.<a name=224:3></a> They shew us what the practical path of a man is here below, as guided by the moral intelligence which the fear of God and the divine word will give him, what true wisdom will teach him.<a name=224:4></a> Only the book does shew that this wisdom is of God and cannot be really without Him, and thus leads us on to Him, though obscurely, who is the wisdom of God and the power of God.<a name=224:5></a>

		Such are the objects proposed in Proverbs, but not by man's cunning, but by beginning with the fear of the Lord and so growing up in discernment.<a name=225:14></a> It is always needed to be "not as fools but as wise.<a name=225:15></a>" A true Christian may do something from want of discretion which may put him in difficulties all his life.<a name=225:16></a> No doubt there is carelessness in it; still he may be very sincere.<a name=225:17></a> But still Christianity seems to me to have a somewhat different character of wisdom -- "simple concerning evil, wise concerning that which is good.<a name=225:18></a>" The Christian follows obediently Christ; and this is the path of wisdom where he has the light of life.<a name=225:19></a> He is so governed by motives, Christ being all to him, that his path is simple, his whole body is full of light, having no part dark.<a name=225:20></a> This is somewhat a different kind of wisdom, though it makes us wise in conduct.<a name=225:21></a> There is wisdom, but more simplicity, because governed more by motives, and following Christ.<a name=225:22></a>

		I now turn to the unfolding of this wisdom in the early chapters of this book.<a name=226:1></a> The first object is to know wisdom and instruction.<a name=226:2></a> Such is the full and general object of the book; that is, the experience of a wise man, and a man corrected and disciplined, where he needs it, from will in any form: wisdom more as to what is without, instruction as to what is within, and, he adds, to discern things that differ, words of understanding -- "perceive" and "understanding" have the same force -- to get a discerning mind as to what passes before us, specially what is said.<a name=226:3></a> But the next passage enlarges the thought -- gives the object and character of the teaching which this wisdom involves where it has to be taught.<a name=226:4></a> Wisdom, instruction, and discernment were the aim of Solomon's proverbs; but what was its character when a person had to receive it?<a name=226:5></a> It was good or wise conduct, righteousness, judgment, and uprightness.<a name=226:6></a> You then have the simple and the young specially brought forward; and it was to make them intelligent and up to what was passing, what they had to do with, so as not to be misled.<a name=226:7></a> There was the giving the sum of wisdom and instruction, the means of receiving instruction, in conduct, righteousness, judgment, and uprightness -- not merely a complete system, but ourselves learning the things that ought to be when needed; and lastly, the simple and young made intelligent and to know what they were about, capable of going through the world, undeceived by it.<a name=226:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The last point noticed here (which is an accessory to the rest, and more of intellectual enjoyment, though of a moral character, than the obligations of wisdom) is the capacity to enter into riddles and dark sayings, which clothe moral truth in a form that gives pungency and power to it, and hides it in forms which, when penetrated, give peculiar point to the relationship in which wisdom stands, give deeper and more interior apprehension of the truth on the one hand, and more vividness on the other.<a name=226:9></a> I take a very easy and familiar instance.<a name=226:10></a> The bramble said to the cedar in Lebanon, Give thy daughter to my son to wife; and there came by a wild beast in Lebanon and trod down the bramble.<a name=226:11></a> How much more that comes home than a precise statement that the king of Judah was feeble!<a name=226:12></a> Proverbs and dark sayings, riddles, parables, all come under this class.<a name=226:13></a> Spiritual apprehension is often needed to see their application.<a name=226:14></a>

		This closes the preface: Solomon now enters on his subject.<a name=227:1></a> "The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge" -- not of wisdom, but of knowledge.<a name=227:2></a> A weighty sentence.<a name=227:3></a> All true knowledge, all moral knowledge begins by putting God in His own place.<a name=227:4></a> Nothing is right or true without that.<a name=227:5></a> For to leave Him out falsifies the position and relationship of all.<a name=227:6></a> I may know physical facts and what are called laws (that is, abstractions from uniform facts), but that is all, without it.<a name=227:7></a> Not that there are no instituted relationships, for there are, as parents, husband and wife, and others now man is fallen.<a name=227:8></a> But right and wrong refer to each in its place.<a name=227:9></a> And not only is the fear of God a motive, which maintains their authority in the heart, but, if I leave God out, what has instituted them and given them their authority is wanting.<a name=227:10></a> Each stone has its own place in the arch, but if the keystone be wanting, none can keep theirs.<a name=227:11></a>

		Besides, the fear of God is the setting aside of will.<a name=227:12></a> How much that works in reference to constituted natural authority, or even mutual obligation, is evident.<a name=227:13></a> I cannot even know physical things fully without the fear of God; because causation necessarily comes in.<a name=227:14></a> How the fear of God, He being the Creator, affects that, is too evident to dwell upon.<a name=227:15></a> The chief theory of antiquity, almost universal (practically, we may say, universal), was, that there was and could be no creation.<a name=227:16></a>

		The only modification, as far as I know, was the production, by an unknown monad of a good and an evil cause -- the Bactrian and Persian faith, Zoroastrianism.<a name=227:17></a> Others got out of the difficulty by emanations.<a name=227:18></a> It was impossible for the supreme God, the monad, to have to say to matter: aeons with some, the Logos, demons, something like Zoroastrian Feroers, and the Logos, with Platonists, were resorted to by others to solve the difficulty for millions.<a name=227:19></a> The monad <i>was</i> alone, and while asleep nothing else was; if he woke, creatures appeared, but it was all Maya, illusion; when he went to sleep, they disappeared again.<a name=227:20></a> The true philosophy was to find it out, have done with creation, and be absorbed into universal spirit or into the one divine spirit.<a name=227:21></a> Modifications there might be; for hundreds of millions thought and think matter eternal, and that true philosophy, or true knowledge, is getting delivered from matter and gaining Nirvana, that is, being extinguished as a lamp goes out.<a name=227:22></a>

		Is this knowledge?<a name=228:1></a> Spirit is far more real than matter.<a name=228:2></a> But God was not known nor feared -- gods were, perhaps, consequently, but not God; and gods were temporary creatures, like men, and more so, and knowledge there was none.<a name=228:3></a> Deliverance was in knowledge -- that all things were nothing.<a name=228:4></a> Some would make a Buddha above God, some absorb a man into God; all the rest perished or disappeared, for there was nothing really to perish.<a name=228:5></a> Is there nothing like this now, when there is not the fear of God?<a name=228:6></a> -- nothing in the modern doctrine of development of species, which would tell us that all comes from a scarcely traceable worm which has left its mark upon some lower Silurian or Cambrian rock, or its analogous fellow in some more recent system, or a polypus, or a graptolith; the apparent ancestor of man being a penguin or an ape, for this is seriously the infidel system of some -- opposed indeed, by others equally infidel, by some other speculation, in which definite and permanent species are recognised?<a name=228:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Is this knowledge?<a name=228:8></a> No.<a name=228:9></a> The reasoning on facts, even without God, even in that which is the legitimate sphere of experimental science, is only the leaving man to the wandering of his own mind, who never will, and never can, know creation without knowing a Creator; that is, without that faith which believes that the worlds were framed by the word of God, and that the things which are seen were not made of the things which do appear.<a name=228:10></a> When we turn to moral things and intellectual philosophy, it is evident there can be no knowledge without the fear of God; for then I enter on the sphere of relationships and obligations; and how can I be right, when I leave out the first and principal one?<a name=228:11></a> I cannot think of mind and find it sufficient for itself within itself.<a name=228:12></a> In point of fact, it has aspirations, and longings, and thoughts of a Being above us, power out of our reach, goodness, good and evil -- of an end of our being, which is not apparent.<a name=228:13></a> If mind cannot suffice for itself, is it to turn to what is below it and exercise merely its powers?<a name=228:14></a> If above, what is God?<a name=228:15></a> what are my relationships with Him?<a name=228:16></a> where do they end, how begin?<a name=228:17></a> Will they end?<a name=228:18></a> I must know God to be at rest, God must have His place.<a name=228:19></a> Now putting God in His true place -- that is the fear of God -- is the true beginning of <i>all</i> knowledge.<a name=228:20></a>

		There is here a modification of this.<a name=228:21></a> It is the fear <i>of Jehovah</i>; that is, it was a known relationship which man had with God, and it is living in that relationship as so known, for example, putting Him in mind and conscience in His true place as in that revealed relationship.<a name=228:22></a> Inconsiderate persons, running wildly after their own will, despise wisdom and instruction the experience and judgment of mature, experienced mind, or the warning and discipline which may apply to what is not such.<a name=228:23></a> But there is a subordinate principle to the fear of the Lord -- subjection in these relationships in which He has established authority in the first instance and immediately over the movements of man's nature: that is, the father and the mother.<a name=228:24></a> God has established this as the first and original bond of authority; will is in subjection, and honour, obligation, respect, come in.<a name=228:25></a> The parent is the source of the path of the child in contrast with his own will.<a name=228:26></a> It is not a law to meet and break his will (if he be not wilful), but to instruct, form, guide, but with authority; yet as honoured by the child and respected, as holding God's place, and with affections which produce willingness instead of will; still it is authority.<a name=228:27></a> Here we have therefore instruction, guidance by warning, discipline, and even by chastisement <i>(paidia</i>; Hebrews 12: 5).<a name=228:28></a> So he is not to forsake the precepts and admonitions of his mother, those early influences which first bend the mind to good.<a name=228:29></a> This is a deeply important principle.<a name=228:30></a> It is not, like marriage, first instituted of all.<a name=228:31></a> It begins with authority, but authority in relationship of love, the source that forms and fashions as well as controls the character, the name that God takes in highest grace towards us; not a lawgiver, but an authority, but whose word is law, where it is a question between that and our own will.<a name=228:32></a>

		Wisdom speaks with the authority of God and aloud, "she uttereth her voice in the streets.<a name=230:1></a>" This is an important principle as regards the results of sin.<a name=230:2></a> We have seen the parental care of the young to preserve from evil, but in the ways of God there is another testimony -- the public warning and call to sinners which wisdom sends forth amongst them.<a name=230:3></a> "Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the street" -- in the concourse of men, to the simple and to the scorner, the guilty yet misled ones, and the open and insulting adversary, and calls them to turn at her reproof, and proposes to bring forth to them, and lead them into, the full outpouring of the Spirit's teaching and the words of God.<a name=230:4></a> It is not here pouring out the Holy Ghost on them: that is quite another thing; but the Spirit of wisdom was there for them, and the words of wisdom to teach and build them up.<a name=230:5></a> The expression is remarkable.<a name=230:6></a> You have the Spirit and the word, though the former, in the sense of its utterances of truth for blessing, poured forth to them.<a name=230:7></a> You have the Lord's complaints in Luke 7, where yet wisdom in all her ways is justified of all her children.<a name=230:8></a> But it is in vain.<a name=230:9></a> Hence, when in the day of desolation and judgment, they will call, but there is no answer.<a name=230:10></a> They may fear the judgment, but there was no love, no submission to the truth; they will eat the fruit of their own ways.<a name=230:11></a> The ease and prosperity and carelessness they have been in, will be their ruin.<a name=230:12></a> The passage does not go beyond judgment (but God's final judgment) in this world, and that there peace would be the portion of those who hearkened to wisdom.<a name=230:13></a> Nor be it further remarked, is there any reference to grace or its power in renewing or quickening.<a name=230:14></a> It is man in this world dealt with in his responsibility.<a name=230:15></a>

		The next chapter takes us farther.<a name=231:1></a> It takes the ground of the son, the subject and obedient soul receiving the words of counsel, and hiding, keeping up within himself the commandments ministered to him, so that he inclines his ear to wisdom and the heart applies itself to understanding.<a name=231:2></a> If more, if she is sought for as invaluable, and searched out as hid treasure, and avowedly and professedly sought after, the result is the apprehending the fear of Jehovah, and arriving at the knowledge of God.<a name=231:3></a> Here therefore it is not a call to men which we have, but the heart itself seeking for true wisdom as its portion and treasure, and thus the intelligence of relationship with Jehovah and the knowledge of God are obtained.<a name=231:4></a> "For Jehovah <i>giveth</i> wisdom.<a name=231:5></a>" It is not merely that I by man's understanding get wiser, but Jehovah gives true wisdom.<a name=231:6></a> It is what He has said, His word, which gives true knowledge and understanding, and he who seeks it will get it.<a name=231:7></a>

		But there is more.<a name=231:8></a> He has laid up treasures of wisdom, His own counsels, for the righteous.<a name=231:9></a> And surely there are in His word treasures of wisdom and knowledge laid up for those who walk uprightly.<a name=231:10></a> Besides, He is their shield and protects them in their walk.<a name=231:11></a> He watches over His own way.<a name=231:12></a> It is a divinely -- protected way: "the paths of judgment," when men walk in God's fear, are kept and protected by Him; and "He preserveth the way of his saints," for God's way and their way are the same, as Moses said, "Shew me now <i>thy</i> way," and Jehovah was to go with him.<a name=231:13></a> This is a great blessing.<a name=231:14></a> It may be a wilderness, in which there is no way, but we have God's way in it, and marked by His own presence.<a name=231:15></a> "When he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them.<a name=231:16></a>" His word is, Follow me.<a name=231:17></a> "If any man serve me, let him follow me.<a name=231:18></a>" And then as Moses saw that thus he would practically find grace in God's sight; so here "then thou shalt understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity" [or rather, uprightness] "every good path.<a name=231:19></a>" Walking uprightly (verse 7) is consistently with, and in faith of, what we know of God.<a name=231:20></a> What is said of Abraham and of Israel?<a name=231:21></a> "Be thou perfect.<a name=231:22></a>" Here it is uprightness properly speaking.<a name=231:23></a> Walking in God's path before Him, there is the spiritual and growing discernment of what is good and what is upright.<a name=231:24></a> This is the positive side, but there is besides this the way in which it guards from evil.<a name=231:25></a>

		"When wisdom entereth into the heart," when it forms thus the spirit and mind, and the desires are formed after it, so that it lives in what is good, and it finds this divine knowledge pleasant to the soul, it becomes a discretion which preserves from the evil which is around, and the snares laid for us, keeps watch over us, and discernment shall watch thee, "keep thee," as one who watches and keeps (as was said before) the path.<a name=232:1></a> That from which they are kept is twofold here: the wickedness of men and corruption.<a name=232:2></a>

		There is no question of going to join in violence to gain wealth, nor is that from which we should be kept the wrong done to us by evil men; but the wisdom and sense of what is right, which the fear of God leads to, keeps us from being led into the path of the wicked man.<a name=232:3></a> Wickedness is deceitful!<a name=232:4></a> We are apt to get hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.<a name=232:5></a> We have need to walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise -- wise concerning that which is good.<a name=232:6></a> Restraint of heart which walks in the fear of God, lowliness (for it is the opposite of pride), is guided in judgment and sees God's way in the seemingly bewildered concourse of men and circumstances.<a name=232:7></a> It has its own way, and has only to follow it; only it depends on God for it.<a name=232:8></a> It is the way of the evil man from which the soul is kept here (verse 12).<a name=232:9></a> The servants of Jehovah are supposed to have a path of uprightness, to a certain degree; so has natural conscience.<a name=232:10></a> The evil man has left it.<a name=232:11></a>

		The other character of evil, from which the discretion of wisdom preserves us, is "the strange woman" (verse 16) the snares and attractions of corruption.<a name=232:12></a> These are the two forms of evil, wickedness, and even violence and wrong; that is, leaving the law and seeking to satisfy one's lusts by violence and corruption.<a name=232:13></a> So even before the flood; so on to the last days, when the beast and the false prophet represent these two principles.<a name=232:14></a> "The strange woman" departed from both the principles we have seen: the fear of God according to the revelation He had given of Himself, and the ministration of care which gave authority over the early thoughts, and a place thereby in holy affections and subjection, "Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.<a name=232:15></a>" All are supposed here to have had to say to God in known relationship, and to be brought up in His ways -- to be in the covenant of God's people.<a name=232:16></a> Nature and grace, as I have said, are not contemplated, but the ways of a people under covenant and law.<a name=232:17></a> The ways of "the strange woman" are death.<a name=232:18></a> The language is stronger here than with robbers before, or wicked men just above; they are bad enough, but the way to "the strange woman" is the way of death.<a name=232:19></a> It is corrupting, destructive of heart as well as conscience.<a name=232:20></a> True affections disappear and are turned into lusts; self-will seeks full gratification where there is not affection at all, instead of another being an object whom we love and esteem, whatever the relationship.<a name=232:21></a> It is self in its lowest and most absolute form.<a name=232:22></a> All through into Babylon, its last form, "the strange woman" has the judgment of God against her, and the ruin of man written on her forehead for those who can read it.<a name=232:23></a>

		But, further; it is when the young man, once led as a child, goes out so as to have his own principles tried, and what governs himself inwardly brought to light.<a name=233:6></a> He still is obedient to what he has learned, and so far is in subjection; but it is now his own moral character, and he has to trust God inwardly, not be in the shelter of a paternal home and authority.<a name=233:7></a> Oh, how often we see departure here, and fair hopes and lovely blossoming of recipient youth turn to bitter fruits!<a name=233:8></a> It is a sad thought to see so many young, in whom the Lord could delight, turn to the way of their own will, and the ways of this corrupt world, fallen and degraded.<a name=233:9></a> It is against this these exhortations seek to guard the mind opening to its own responsibilities.<a name=233:10></a> Both what is right, and deference for those divinely established influences are to be maintained in the soul.<a name=233:11></a> And I may remark, however wrong example and the direction given to life may be, yet the wickedest of parents would desire his son to be virtuous; and deference to a parent will be a bright spot in the wildest of sons, and a hopeful influence.<a name=233:12></a>

		He now enters into details in verses 5 and following.<a name=234:18></a> Two paths are before man -- to trust God, or himself and his own wisdom for his happiness.<a name=234:19></a> This is just what Eve failed in; she did not confide in God, trust in Him and what He had said, for her happiness, but leaned to her own understanding, thought she should better secure it by doing what she thought would be advantageous.<a name=234:20></a> So every sinner; he thinks he can better secure his own happiness in doing his own will than in listening to God.<a name=234:21></a> Trust in God is the first positive active principle of life and wisdom; the next is owning Him in our ways, taking His will, authority, as that which is to form them, not our will and wisdom, and that openly (verse 6).<a name=234:22></a> He will surely direct our steps.<a name=234:23></a> No human wisdom can guide like that.<a name=234:24></a> It may be very cunning -- know human nature.<a name=234:25></a> But God has a way which He has laid down morally for us -- a path of obedience, of righteousness, and of God; and He who has done so orders all things.<a name=234:26></a> In the end His judgment will prevail.<a name=234:27></a> We may not see it prevail here -- thus faith may be exercised; where His direct government is exercised, it win, but <i>always</i> in result.<a name=234:28></a> The end of the Lord is sure; heaviness may endure for a night, for a season if need be; but, for the faithful soul, joy cometh in the morning, a morning near to come.<a name=234:29></a> But self-confidence is ruin.<a name=234:30></a> "Be not wise in thine own eyes" (verse 7).<a name=234:31></a> They do not see far if they only see self, and that is what always is in our own eyes.<a name=234:32></a> The fear of God, as we have seen, the moral path of His fear, is that on which He waits in goodness, however things may seem -- this, and departing from all evil.<a name=234:33></a> This is something more than walking in His fear -- there is an abhorrence of evil, partly in itself, partly as contrary to His will.<a name=234:34></a> I may walk in God's fear, do no evil myself, without, I think, being characterised by departing from evil.<a name=234:35></a> No doubt, walking rightly is not doing evil.<a name=234:36></a> But evil is in the world, and there is, so to speak, a positive character of relationship to it, that is, departing from it, abhorrence of it.<a name=234:37></a> Adam, innocent, would have walked uprightly, done nothing wrong; he would not have departed from evil, he had nothing to say to it.<a name=234:38></a> I have or may have.<a name=234:39></a> I depart from it, leave and break with it.<a name=234:40></a> This has to do with holiness.<a name=234:41></a> We have seen Jehovah owned by confidence, and in His servant's ways.<a name=234:42></a> It requires confidence in Him to guide one's ways by His will.<a name=234:43></a> Now we come to another way of owning devotedness of heart, owning all positive good and blessing to come from Him, and manifested in the ready but due offering of a willing heart.<a name=234:44></a> Thus blessing is found, temporal blessing; verse 8-10.<a name=234:45></a> It must be remembered that we are always here on the ground of present government in the earth.<a name=234:46></a> Higher objects may bring sorrow as regards this world, as it has ever been.<a name=234:47></a> Now we can only apply the principle.<a name=234:48></a> Peter's epistles give the degree in which this government applies to Christian standing.<a name=234:49></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Epistle to the Ephesians has a peculiar character.<a name=266:1></a> it considers man not as having a life of sin, which he has to hold as dead in principle, and to resist in practice; but, in order to give God His own full part, and the blessing He gives its full character and perfection, it treats man as <i>dead</i> in trespasses and sins; and hence his whole moral existence is a new one, and depends on God, and is derived from His power; it has its origin and subsistence from His creative and life-giving energies.<a name=266:2></a> It is a new creation.<a name=266:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence, in the first chapter, before even speaking of the redemption which meets the necessities of man, the Spirit directs our eye to the eternal counsels of God's grace, towards those chosen in Christ (verse 3-6), the unspeakable riches of the blessings to which they are destined.<a name=266:4></a> The inheritance which has fallen to them in Christ comes afterwards (verse 11), as a subordinate thing.<a name=266:5></a> Hence we have the union of the church with Christ as its Head, exalted above every name in this world and that which is to come: hence the vivifying and raising up with Christ, and setting in heavenly places in Him, where all difference of Jew and Gentile is for ever lost; and our creation again in Christ, the Holy Ghost, according to the mystery hidden from ages, but now revealed, becoming by His presence the power of the church's unity as the habitation of God; and the conferring of every gift necessary for the perfecting of the saints, for the gathering and edifying of the body by the Head on high, who had received the Spirit to this end for the members thus united to Him.<a name=266:6></a> Thus viewed in its Head, and in the power of the Holy Ghost on the earth, the church has a heavenly character; and as its privileges take this elevated character, so also its testimony, its difficulties, and its combats.<a name=266:7></a> Compare chapters 1: 3; 2: 6; 3: 10; 6: 12.<a name=266:8></a> For in the measure in which our spiritual position is raised, so, of course, do the difficulties and exercises of heart assume a character which requires greater experience and greater power.<a name=266:9></a> Our spiritual advance introduces us necessarily into them.<a name=266:10></a> But God is faithful not to suffer us to be tempted above that we are able.<a name=266:11></a> We could not expect a babe in Christ to be exercised as an apostle.<a name=266:12></a> Still the principles of all temptations are in general the same, and the experience of an apostle would render him capable of entering into the trials of an infant all the better.<a name=266:13></a> His more thorough knowledge of the wiles of Satan enables him to expose those wiles in their true light to the more inexperienced Christian.<a name=266:14></a> Because they have ceased to be wiles for himself, he can expose their wiliness to him by whom they are as yet unsuspected, or imperfectly judged.<a name=266:15></a> By following the word of God the simplest soul avoids danger, though it may be inexperienced in the devices of the enemy; for in that path God is found, and all is simple.<a name=266:16></a> One is wise concerning that which is good, and can be simple concerning evil.<a name=266:17></a> Still such as we are there are exercises; and the same human nature is in the oldest and in the youngest saint.<a name=266:18></a> The form of the trial may be different and suited to the progress made; but the principles are the same, and the means of defence too.<a name=266:19></a> One may, if humbler in spirit, use them better, but God's weapons do not vary in their nature.<a name=266:20></a> The apostle will explain their use to the young soldier; but he uses (if with greater expertness) those he explains.<a name=266:21></a>

		The first thing is that we remember, what I have just remarked, that the armour is that of God; that no human power, no wisdom, is of any avail.<a name=269:15></a> Satan's weapons, or wiles, go clean through them at once.<a name=269:16></a> The use of such weapons is the foolishness of confidence in self, which is (witness Peter's case) exactly what exposes us to him.<a name=269:17></a> Let us remember too the foundation we have laid: that the conflict with Satan here spoken of supposes peace with God.<a name=269:18></a> If I am really on my feet, combating with Satan, and armed by God, I have no question with God as to whether He is for me.<a name=269:19></a> My combats are not with Him, my fears have not Him for their object.<a name=269:20></a> The anxieties of the unreconciled soul have the dread of God, the uncertainty of His thoughts, for their source.<a name=269:21></a> The combats of the reconciled souls are with the enemy.<a name=269:22></a> Remark, further, that it is not in the time of combat, in the evil day, I am to put on my armour.<a name=269:23></a> I enter into it armed, at least if I enter into it aright, and in the way to be victorious.<a name=269:24></a> The armour we wear is our abiding state as regards this world, though with God all be peace.<a name=269:25></a>

		In the next place remark that those parts of the armour which relate to the spiritual condition of the Christian's own soul and his walk -- what relates to the subjugation of flesh and self -- come first; then the maintenance of practical confidence in God (and how true that order is!<a name=270:1></a>); and then the activity of the believer as regards others: all closed in by the expression of entire dependence.<a name=270:2></a> It is not the force and power of Satan which we have to resist, but his wiles.<a name=270:3></a> When really resisted, he has no force against us, for he is overcome by Christ; and the new nature he has nothing in or for.<a name=270:4></a> When the inclinations of the heart are unjudged, then he has the power to deceive us.<a name=270:5></a> Hence, as to receiving any truth, the state of the soul is really what is in question.<a name=270:6></a> When this is not right, reasonings are vain.<a name=270:7></a> When the eye is single, the whole body will be full of light.<a name=270:8></a> So when the flesh is not judged, the enemy can overthrow and trouble us.<a name=270:9></a> "Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.<a name=270:10></a>"

		The first part then of our armour is to have the loins girt about with truth.<a name=270:11></a> The word first girds about my own loins before I can use it as a sword.<a name=270:12></a> The girding about the loins is that strengthening and giving of firmness to the whole man, which cannot be if all is left loose in his ways and mind, and which flows from the application of truth to his soul.<a name=270:13></a> And this application of truth to his soul, though an internal operation, has a double bearing.<a name=270:14></a> It is the application to the heart and conscience of all that is revealed in Christ.<a name=270:15></a> Now, this first judges all that is not of Christ, detects it and judges it; at the same time what is in the heart is seen in its true light as compared with what I see in Christ revealed as truth to my heart.<a name=270:16></a> I have judged what springs from the flesh and is adapted to it; it has lost its false appearances and deceiving power, and -- as Christ is really there -- its power altogether.<a name=270:17></a> I do not let my heart go after it; it has lost its place there, because not seen by the flesh, but judged by the Spirit.<a name=270:18></a> Instead of having any attractions for the heart inspired by this, it has its true hateful character.<a name=270:19></a> Christ, as truth, has put it into its true light, out of the affections, and into its own judged hatefulness.<a name=270:20></a> It is no longer myself as a moral affection at all.<a name=270:21></a> It is sin and flesh in my eyes.<a name=270:22></a> But besides this, there is what has wrought this judgment, the revelation of the truth itself of Christ in the heart.<a name=270:23></a> Hence what is good is loved, has power in the heart, authority there; the will and affections are bridled by what has authority over them -- instead of being let loose -- while they, at the same time, delight in what exercises this authority over them.<a name=270:24></a> They are girded up, restrained, given moral tone and firmness, by the known value of that which is an obligation, because it is in Christ; a delight because it is good.<a name=270:25></a> For in man obligation, where it is in grace, gives strength.<a name=270:26></a> That is when the thing itself is delighted in, not imposed on, as a law.<a name=270:27></a> It is a governed heart, not an ungoverned will.<a name=270:28></a> Yet it is intelligent, and delights in what it sees in Christ.<a name=270:29></a> It governs itself.<a name=270:30></a> The girding about the loins with truth then is the application of the truth to the affections, so that a man is braced up, having to do with what is right in authority over his soul, while he delights in it too.<a name=270:31></a>

		John 17 goes somewhat farther: "Sanctify them," we read there, "through thy truth, thy word is truth.<a name=272:1></a> For their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also may be sanctified by the truth.<a name=272:2></a>" Here we have the word bringing in its positive formative action, as well as its detective; and Christ also set apart as the perfection of that which we are to be, that the revelation of what He is to the soul may conform us to Him.<a name=272:3></a> It is evident that such a communication of what Christ is, while attracting and delighting the new creature, would in everything judge the old; but it is more than merely the divine word as a sword, as the eye of God on us, discerning and detecting; there is an attractive and an assimilating power.<a name=272:4></a> It is a man whose nature I have (for He is my life), in whom I see all this moral perfection, love, holiness, truth, absolute purity, grace, patient kindness, devotedness beyond all measure, to us self-sacrifice, and an absolutely single eye in devotedness to God His Father's glory, and all the life-giving fulness of God in all these things.<a name=272:5></a> All this is in man, and in One with whom I have to do; who loves me; with whom I am one.<a name=272:6></a> He has sanctified Himself for our sakes.<a name=272:7></a> By the communication of all this, and much more than this, in the truth, we are sanctified.<a name=272:8></a> First of all, it is in believing, so as to have a share in it, and then by daily realisation of it in detail, attaching the heart thus to Christ.<a name=272:9></a> "We all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord.<a name=272:10></a>" Blessed portion!<a name=272:11></a> Used, it is true, in the passage which occupies us in the Ephesians, more in its guardian power than in its delight and advantages -- in its moral bracing energy, than in its joys in communion; but profitable alike for both.<a name=272:12></a> The truth, then, as this divine revelation to the soul by the word, detects all that gives a handle to Satan in us, and destroys its hold on the soul.<a name=272:13></a> It causes that we are no longer debtors to the flesh; for we have a new life with God, in which we have a right to live, and over which Satan has no right and no power; and in which the flesh has no claim and no part; and which is freely and new-given of God, so that none else has any claim over it.<a name=272:14></a> Hence the absolute and exclusive claim of God is brought in, and with delight to the soul -- delight, because obedience to Him is now delight.<a name=272:15></a> We love Him and His claims over us.<a name=272:16></a> It is delight, because the things He calls us to walk in are enjoyed morally by our souls.<a name=272:17></a> There is an intelligent nature which is of Him, and from Him, having the delights and desires of His nature, and rejoiced to have the perfect expression of its own desires in God's claims over us.<a name=272:18></a> For we are "partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption which is in the world through lust.<a name=272:19></a>" Hence it is called the perfect law of liberty.<a name=272:20></a> "He who hath looked [looked down closely] into the perfect law, that of liberty, and continueth therein, not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of work, that man shall be blest in his doing [it].<a name=272:21></a>" There is our own delight in good thus; the authority of God in it; the rejection of evil, yet not in haughtiness, for God is there; and the authority of God over us, yet in personal delight in what is good, in a nature which loves it for its own sake.<a name=272:22></a> What hold has Satan there?<a name=272:23></a> The mind is braced up, the loins girt about with truth in the midst of the dissolution and uncertainty of the world; dissolution to which the flesh would yield itself at once.<a name=272:24></a> It is girding the loins.<a name=272:25></a>

		But in my conflict with Satan, while I cannot do without this, I need something else -- practical righteousness.<a name=274:1></a> My conscience must be without reproach, in order to combat with him.<a name=274:2></a> If my conscience be not purged with the blood of Christ, I have not yet peace with God; I am still in Egypt, though I may be striving to get out of it; I do not yet know the power of redemption.<a name=274:3></a> I cannot say that God is for me, nor that I am for God in this world.<a name=274:4></a> I need to be delivered and reconciled.<a name=274:5></a> But if I am, a conscience practically bad will make me weak before the enemy.<a name=274:6></a> How can he, whose conscience reproaches him, whom the world could reproach if aware of it, how can he go boldly into the combat?<a name=274:7></a> He is afraid the blow may reach him there; he is obliged to think of that: he is not free to think, in simplicity of heart, of nothing but the service which is before him.<a name=274:8></a> The Spirit of God also is grieved, and lets him, if he go on thus carelessly, feel that he has failed, as Israel before Ai.<a name=274:9></a> For boldness when we have failed shews rather indifference to sin, or an effort to carry on appearances, when the heart is not right.<a name=274:10></a> But if the conscience be good, the walk upright, there is confidence in God, and self has not to be thought of.<a name=274:11></a> One can do God's work freely.<a name=274:12></a> Thus Paul -- "Pray for us, for we trust that we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly.<a name=274:13></a>" And again, "Herein do I exercise myself day and night, to have a conscience void of offence towards God and towards man.<a name=274:14></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		The second part of the armour, then, is a righteous walk, a walk with God.<a name=274:15></a> Only remark that, as to confidence in service, it is not merely evil known, or easily to be known to others; it is all allowed evil.<a name=274:16></a> Because Satan can use this against the conscience and make it timid; and certainly the Holy Ghost will not make it hard or indifferent.<a name=274:17></a> A good conscience before God is acquired by one thing alone, by the blood-shedding and work of Christ.<a name=274:18></a> But the result of this is the presence of the Holy Ghost in us; and then a good conscience <i>against Satan</i> is only when the Spirit has not been grieved by anything done contrary to the light He has afforded me.<a name=274:19></a>

		The existence of flesh in us, though judged as sin, does not give a bad conscience, nor interrupt communion; but the moment it is allowed, even in mind, it does both.<a name=275:1></a> Although the Christian who walks faithfully, clothed with the whole armour of God, enjoys the effect of its use, in the peaceful joy of communion, the difference must have, perhaps, been felt, between this state and the loss of communion, to know the immense importance of this armour, or rather of wearing it.<a name=275:2></a> Far better however to enjoy the confiding peace, which accompanies its use, than to know its importance by exposing oneself without it to the assaults of the enemy.<a name=275:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Communion with God is a real thing, in which He pours into the soul, in a greater or less degree, the deep joy of His presence -- of that favour and perfect love in which He communicates with the soul, revealing Himself -- and gives, by His presence, the happiness of a relationship, in which no breach is suspected, nor thought of, in which the soul lives.<a name=275:4></a> It is more than faith, though founded on it; other than the certainty of salvation, though the crown and seal and realisation of this.<a name=275:5></a> The abstract certainty, the consoling certainty, that my Father loves me, and will not, nay, cannot, do otherwise, is another thing from happy intercourse with this love, with no consciousness of anything else, or of anything in the way of that enjoyment.<a name=275:6></a> The certainty of love in God constitutes the bitterness of the sense of the loss of the enjoyment of it, for I speak only of saints here.<a name=275:7></a> The Spirit's seal to the truth assures of God's love; and Christ, if we fail, intercedes for us.<a name=275:8></a> But the Holy Ghost being the spring of the enjoyment of it in the heart is another thing.<a name=275:9></a> The one -- the foundation, it is true, of all -- assures that God is for us: the other is God in us, filling the heart with joy, with communion with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.<a name=275:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two ways, very distinct indeed in their character, in which I may fail in this communion: one negatively, where negligence has deprived me of positive and sensible intercourse with God, the heart being cold and indifferent; the other, where the conscience is concerned, and, the heart having allowed the enemy to prevail against it, the Holy Ghost becomes in us a stern reprover; and while never destroying the sense of God's love, makes us bitterly bewail the loss of the inward sense and enjoyment of it, and makes us taste, more or less, the fruits of sin, as in its nature separating the soul from God; and thus makes it horrible to us, not as feeling <i>with God</i> its evil morally, but as in its nature separating us from Him -- not as to faith, indeed, allowing us to suppose that He will give us up at all, but to feel what it is.<a name=275:11></a> But this last is an extreme case, and discipline, on God's part, and very severe discipline too.<a name=275:12></a> The other, alas!<a name=275:13></a> is but too common.<a name=275:14></a> They are very different.<a name=275:15></a> Many Christians live frequently in a state analogous to the last case I have supposed; but in them it is from being yet under the law, and from their not being established in their relationship with God; and the distress, consequently, is not so great, because there has not been the same nearness to God.<a name=275:16></a> I have said these few words as to the result of not using the armour with which God has furnished us.<a name=275:17></a> I return to its character and use.<a name=275:18></a>

		I have spoken somewhat of the loins being girt about with truth, and of the breastplate of righteousness; of the affections being governed and kept in order by the truth; the revelation of Christ, and the walk which flows from this; the godly vigilance of an unassailable conscience.<a name=276:1></a> Thus the soul is in practical peace -- has not to occupy itself with itself -- can walk in unsuspecting openness and confidence.<a name=276:2></a> When the heart is full of peace, and enjoys the unsuspecting sweetness of it with God, it walks in the spirit of peace.<a name=276:3></a> This peace characterises all its ways and relationships with others.<a name=276:4></a> There is not effort or restraint, nothing to guard or keep back.<a name=276:5></a> The course is natural, unconstrained and unsuspecting.<a name=276:6></a> There is not fear of evil because there is not the consciousness of it.<a name=276:7></a> Not that the soul is without wisdom; that cannot be in such a world; but it is wise concerning that which is good, and simple concerning evil.<a name=276:8></a> It does not much fear evil befalling it, because it has a portion of peace that outward evil cannot touch; nor does it count on outward good as its resource.<a name=276:9></a> In this peace the heart depends on God; and, as above evil in this sense, it brings peace with it into the scene through which it passes.<a name=276:10></a> The expression, having the feet shod with it, is beautiful, as shewing the habitual character of the walk.<a name=276:11></a> Such was the character, especially, of Christ.<a name=276:12></a> He brought in peace -- rejected indeed, but not the less true -- the great Peacemaker.<a name=276:13></a> He declared such should be called the children of God.<a name=276:14></a> These three first parts of the armour are practically expressed in the words, as far as relationship with the saints goes: "Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace one with another.<a name=276:15></a>"

		Faith here is the full confidence in God, which counts on His goodness and faithfulness, and that He is for us -- which trusts a God who is entirely for us.<a name=277:7></a> Without this all is despair, or near to it, in a conscience which feels that it has to do with God.<a name=277:8></a> Satan has got in; and to the soul which feels the need of God being for it there is left only the agonising feeling that He is not.<a name=277:9></a> Hence the Saviour prays for Peter, that his faith might not fail; that is, that in spite of his dreadful fall he might not be left to the thought that therefore God had abandoned him, was against him, and that there was no hope.<a name=277:10></a> The fiery darts of Satan are not his efforts to seduce by acting on our various lusts; but where, by any means, our hearts are turned away from God, the inroads he makes in the form of unbelief and despair.<a name=277:11></a> This is the force of the passage in the Corinthians, lest Satan tempt you for your incontinency.<a name=277:12></a> The evil was there, the incontinency was supposed, the temptation was the power of Satan over the soul, which was the result.<a name=277:13></a> It is evidently a different power from his seductions.<a name=277:14></a> There is no pleasure in despair, but deep agony.<a name=277:15></a> The flesh finds its pleasure in satisfying its lusts, but there is no lust of despair it is as a consuming fire in the soul.<a name=277:16></a>

		We may see, in the temptations of Christ, as far as He could be on the same ground as we, this same difference.<a name=277:17></a> There could be no lusts and no despair; but Satan sought, at the beginning of His career, to seduce Him from the path of obedience; and brought all the terror of death upon Him at the end.<a name=277:18></a> Only in the former case He maintained His first estate; in the second, His agony only led Him into more earnest communion with His Father.<a name=277:19></a> But He went through, for us, the whole pressure of Satan's power; for us in both respects: only He was never reached within by it, so as to turn Him aside from God, in the perfect path of obedience.<a name=277:20></a> The fiery darts of the enemy are the power of the enemy over the soul, when it has been left exposed to his inroads, by the shield of faith (an entire confidence in the grace of God, in His favour, as that in which we dwell, and changes not) having been down.<a name=277:21></a>

		Such, I doubt not, are his fiery darts; and terrible they are, when, from the shield of faith not having been our safeguard -- having been dropped, we are exposed to them.<a name=278:1></a> But I would add, that I do not believe that this is ever a simple case: that is, that it happened by itself, without some producing cause.<a name=278:2></a> The passage I have alluded to in the Corinthians explains what I mean: Satan tempted, for incontinency, a heart which had opened the door to him by lust; which had even strayed out, in spirit, into his domains, forsaking God -- not in will perhaps but in heart -- in letting itself loose, exposed itself naturally to his power; particularly in these lusts, which a corrupt will nourishes, which, as the apostle expresses it, war against the soul, and which are so contrary to the very nature of God, to His purity and holiness.<a name=278:3></a> Where these are in any degree wilfully indulged by one who is a Christian, it is well if the result be not this terrible power of Satan over the soul, which for a time at least darkens the light of God in it, and hides His favour; the knowledge of which only makes the loss of the sense of it more terrible to him who suffers under it: it seems to be gone for ever, at least it may reach this point.<a name=278:4></a> At any rate it is the most terrible chastisement which can reach a human heart.<a name=278:5></a>

		The shield of faith then is that entire confidence in God, flowing from the real personal knowledge of redemption, which silences every doubt and prevents every question, by the personal knowledge of God's love, which, instead of having questions with God, reckons upon Him against everything else.<a name=279:12></a> If God be for us, who can be against us?<a name=279:13></a> It is not merely peace, as regards evil, through the blood of Christ, but confidence in God, resulting from His being thus known.<a name=279:14></a> "If now I have found grace in thy sight, O Lord," says Moses, "let my Lord, I pray thee, go among us, for it is a stiff-necked people.<a name=279:15></a>" God is our resource and help against ourselves, our security against all else.<a name=279:16></a> Satan may prove a thousand things against us; our knowledge of God is the answer to them all.<a name=279:17></a>

		Entire unwavering confidence in God Himself is the spring then and source of energy; the efforts of Satan to break and enfeeble it are quenched by the shield of faith.<a name=280:1></a> Maintained practically in its place by walking with God, it rests in itself on the true divinely given knowledge of God, as for us, as He revealed Himself in Christ; a knowledge sustained and fed by the grace and intercession of Jesus.<a name=280:2></a> But there is a further development of this condition of soul, closely allied to it, yet different -- the knowledge of and possession of salvation.<a name=280:3></a> The difference is this: it is not abiding confidence in what God is, but the joyful certainty of what He has done, the consciousness of the position He has set us in.<a name=280:4></a>

		Confidence is dependence, a blessed, right, and softening feeling; though emboldening in what is right, and as against the enemies of our souls.<a name=280:5></a> Salvation gives boldness and energy: we hold up the head, so to speak, a head covered by the strength and salvation of God Himself.<a name=280:6></a> "I would to God," says Paul, "that not only thou but also all that hear me, were both almost, and altogether, such as I am save these bonds.<a name=280:7></a>" Was he -- after two years' imprisonment and wrong, in the presence of judges, as a chained prisoner, without resource save in God -- was he disheartened or fearful in spirit?<a name=280:8></a> The helmet of a known salvation was on his head.<a name=280:9></a> Yet to be possessed in glory, all was his in Christ, all was his in his own soul.<a name=280:10></a> He was what the love that was in his heart could wish others to be; the consciousness that it was his animated the love which expressed itself towards others, gave it its object in its own happiness.<a name=280:11></a> His relationship to God was known, his being in the light as God was in the light, in the blessed joy of holiness, sin and evil and all confusion outside -- Jesus' glory complete -- the Father's love, unhindered by anything in the state of the object, is rested on.<a name=280:12></a> This secured by the cross, so that it could fully flow in now; the possession of Jesus' love, in whom it was all secured; salvation was a helmet to his head; he could lift it up before all.<a name=280:13></a> Nor is it less such to us in the day of battle: we have not to think about ourselves; that is secured, for that helmet is riven by no blow: we are free to use our wisdom and strength undisturbed by any fear for self in the conflict in which we are set.<a name=280:14></a> We can seek victory and blessing for others, glory for the Lord, success before Him.<a name=280:15></a> He has thought of us and put us into the place where we are, and have more than man's heart knows how to desire.<a name=280:16></a> And secure in it we can think of serving Him.<a name=280:17></a> Evidently this, as all else, must be realised by the ungrieved power of the Holy Ghost to use and walk in it.<a name=280:18></a>

		DIVINE PERFECTNESS OF LOVE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1 John 4: 17
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The love of God is presented in two very distinct ways in this chapter.<a name=291:1></a> First, in verse 9 as manifested in giving His Son <i>for us</i>, and then in verse 17, in its double fruit of love and light <i>in us</i>.<a name=291:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God's love in contrast to man's love is distinguished by this, that while man must have something to draw out his love, as it is said, "For a good man some would even dare to die; but God commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us.<a name=291:3></a>" God's love is without motive, there being nothing attractive in the object that calls it out.<a name=291:4></a> "In due time Christ died for the ungodly.<a name=291:5></a>" God's love sees no good in us.<a name=291:6></a> The brightest proof of God's love and man's enmity was seen in the cross.<a name=291:7></a> They met there, and the superiority of God's love was manifested; as Jethro says, "In the thing wherein they dealt proudly, he was above them.<a name=291:8></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having shewn out the first fruit in verse 9, that is, the open manifestation of His love to us while we were yet sinners, we learn His purposes and counsels about us as saints; in the second place, in verse 17, "Herein is love with us made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment, because as he is so are we in this world.<a name=291:9></a>" This is a very different thing from His first visiting us in our sins.<a name=291:10></a> "Herein is love with us made perfect.<a name=291:11></a>" The perfectness of God's love toward His saints is seen in the bringing them to be like Himself.<a name=291:12></a> The sovereign grace of God puts the saint into the same place as Christ, that we may have the same kind of fellowship with the Father that Christ had.<a name=291:13></a> So in John 14 the Lord says, "My peace I give unto you" -- that is, the peace He had with the Father -- "not as the world giveth give I unto you.<a name=291:14></a>" The world has a character of a benefactor, and that it sometimes gives generously I do not deny, but then it is by helping a man, as he is, out of the resources which it has, which may be all very well, because by helping him it is only taking care of itself; but it is evidently a different thing here, for Christ takes us clean out of our condition, putting us into the same relationship with the Father as Himself.<a name=291:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The world cannot give in this way; there is no guarding anything for self in Christ's unjealous love, but in us there is.<a name=291:16></a> Therefore He could say, "Not as the world giveth I unto you.<a name=291:17></a>" His delight was to shew that the Father loved them as He loved Him.<a name=291:18></a> "The glory thou hast given me, I have given them, that the world may know that thou hast loved them as thou hast loved me.<a name=291:19></a>" Jesus not only loves them Himself, but He will have it known by the world that they are loved by the Father, as He Himself is loved.<a name=291:20></a> Can there be anything more disinterested than this?<a name=291:21></a> (Though the word "disinterested" fails to give the full meaning.<a name=291:22></a>) Still au this is guarded, for Christ ever keeps His place as the eternal Son of God.<a name=291:23></a> As at the mount of transfiguration, the moment there is the question of putting Moses and Elias on an equality with Jesus, they both disappear: for when Peter said, "Let us make here three tabernacles, one for thee, one for Moses, and one for Elias, while he thus spake there came a cloud and overshadowed them," and instantly they vanished.<a name=291:24></a> "And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son.<a name=291:25></a>" It is not said, "hear them," but "hear him.<a name=291:26></a>" "And when the voice was past Jesus was found alone.<a name=291:27></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=292>[Page 292]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If Christ in His wondrous grace reveals Moses and Elias as His companions and associates in glory, the moment Peter in his foolishness gives utterance to the thought that would place them on an equality with Christ, they must both vanish from the scene.<a name=292:1></a> It does not say, "as the Father loves me," but "as he loved me" (as a man), for however Christ may bring us into the same place with Himself, if we elevate ourselves to an equality with Christ, immediately we shall be above Him; and it is ever the case that the more a saint enters into his elevation as being brought into the same place with Christ, the more he adores Christ as God over all, blessed for evermore.<a name=292:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is ever to be borne in mind.<a name=292:3></a> The thought in verse 17, "As he is so are we," is of putting the saints in the same place as Christ.<a name=292:4></a> If I have righteousness, it is a divine righteousness, "We are made the righteousness of God in him"; if eternal life, it is a divine life, "When Christ, who is our life, shall appear"; if glory, it is the same glory, "The glory which thou hast given me, I have given them ": if it is the inheritance, we are "joint-heirs with Christ"; if love, it is the same love wherewith the Father loved Christ, "Thou hast loved them as thou hast loved me.<a name=292:5></a>" The love is the most difficult thing for us to enter into, but the Lord would have our hearts enjoying it.<a name=292:6></a>

		<a name=293>[Page 293]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All that we have in Christ is brought out in this passage, in this general expression of God's grace to bless us, not only by Christ but with Christ.<a name=293:1></a> Christ could not be satisfied unless it was so, we being the fruit of the travail of His soul.<a name=293:2></a> "Father, I will that they whom thou hast given me be with me.<a name=293:3></a>" Again, "I will come again and receive you unto myself, that where I am there ye may be also.<a name=293:4></a>" The Father's love is seen in giving His Son to die for us, and thus bringing us into the perfect place.<a name=293:5></a> Some Christians do not give verse 17 all its power.<a name=293:6></a> They refer it simply to our position before God, respecting the day of judgment.<a name=293:7></a> Whatever judgment may come, the saint has nothing to do with it, for where there is a question about judgment, there can be no boldness.<a name=293:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is nothing more comforting than the perfect confidence of having God as my Father.<a name=293:9></a> I cannot get the affections in full play if I think God is going to judge me.<a name=293:10></a> But if I have the Spirit of adoption, and I sin or do wrong, I run to my Father directly, because I know my Father is not going to judge me for it; for God is my Father and not my judge.<a name=293:11></a> Therefore boldness is needed for the exercise of spiritual affections in me.<a name=293:12></a> And we ought to remember this, for Christians often shrink from it, but it is evident that if I am hesitating whether God is going to bless me or to judge me, I cannot love Him.<a name=293:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then observe another thing.<a name=293:14></a> There is a great difference between spiritual desires and spiritual affections, though both have the same root.<a name=293:15></a> Spiritual desires, if the relationship which would meet them be not known, only produce sorrow.<a name=293:16></a> Take an orphan, for instance, in a family where the parents' love to the children is witnessed every day; the sorrowful experience would be, Oh, that I had a father!<a name=293:17></a> The child who has its parents has the same desires, but the relationship exists of parent and child, and it knows the joy and gladness.<a name=293:18></a> As the children of God we must have the consciousness of the relationship in which we stand to God.<a name=293:19></a> It is not merely that we have a divine nature, which gives us spiritual desires, but we must also have a consciousness of the relationship into which we are brought by the power of what Christ has done.<a name=293:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is clear there never could be a question between Christ and His Father, as He daily and hourly enjoyed the consciousness of His Father's love.<a name=293:21></a> "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.<a name=293:22></a>" So also He says, "My peace I give unto you.<a name=293:23></a>" Again He says, "That they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.<a name=293:24></a>" The Father's delight was in Christ, and He knew it in the daily enjoyment of it.<a name=293:25></a> Well, "as he is, so are we.<a name=293:26></a>" While Christ lays the ground of our relationship by being the propitiation for our sins and the source of our life, yet it is not by Christ's righteousness that I get boldness.<a name=293:27></a> I must be righteous, of course; I cannot have boldness without it, but besides this there is another character God has toward me, that of a Father; and I have another character towards God, that of a child.<a name=293:28></a> I have not only righteousness, but I am a son.<a name=293:29></a>
	</div>

		<a name=294>[Page 294]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And here I would notice the defectiveness of some of our hymns, which call Christ our brother.<a name=294:1></a> We never find in Scripture that Christ is called our brother.<a name=294:2></a> In the fulness of His grace He is not ashamed to call us brethren.<a name=294:3></a> My father is a man, but I do not call him a man.<a name=294:4></a> It would shew a want of filial reverence in me if I did.<a name=294:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In nothing is the power of the Spirit of God more shewn in the child of God than in the suitableness of his expressions and feelings towards God.<a name=294:6></a> If we are really enjoying the place of infinite privilege, the source and giver of these privileges will maintain His own proper place in our hearts.<a name=294:7></a> Theorising about it will not do.<a name=294:8></a> A common expression is, We cannot be always on the mount.<a name=294:9></a> So far this is true, because we all have our place of service down here; but I would observe, that being in the mount of God's presence always humbles, though when a saint gets down again he may be proud of having been there.<a name=294:10></a> Paul was not puffed up when he was in God's presence caught up to the third heavens; but, after he had been there, he needed a thorn in the flesh lest he should be exalted above measure.<a name=294:11></a> The heart is never proud in God's presence, and, only when it is really there, is it really in its right place, for when out of it the flesh turns everything into mischief.<a name=294:12></a> "As he is, so are we," not only in the same standing and acceptance as Christ, but brought by the communication of His life into the same relationship as Himself.<a name=294:13></a> While in the beginning of the epistle the foundation is laid deep and wide in the cleansing blood, still the grand subject of the epistle is the place into which we are brought.<a name=294:14></a> "Herein is love with us made perfect.<a name=294:15></a>" If my heart has seized the truth that God as a Father is acting in grace towards me, there is no place for fear.<a name=294:16></a> In all my need, and even in that with which I ought to have nothing to do, in all my sin, I fly to Him.<a name=294:17></a> I could not in my sin fly to my judge, but I have confidence in my Father's love and I fly to Him without fear; for "perfect love casteth out fear.<a name=294:18></a>"

		THE CAPACITY FOR KNOWING DIVINE LOVE, AND HOW WE KNOW IT
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1 John 4: 7-19
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would add to the paper on 1 John 4 some observations of a somewhat different character, though partly referring to the same truths.<a name=296:1></a> The verses which I would seek in a measure to unfold are from verse 7 to 19.<a name=296:2></a> There are two subjects in these verses -- the capacity for knowing divine love, and the manifestation or proof of it, or more generally how we know it.<a name=296:3></a> First, as regards the capacity of the saints, that in them by which the blessedness of God's love is known and enjoyed, it is twofold: first, participating in, the divine nature (verse 7); secondly, God's dwelling in us (verse 12).<a name=296:4></a> This gives it its full and perfect character and forms the link with the manifestations of this love, for this reason, that we cannot then separate the capacity to enjoy God and the manifestation of God, because as dwelling in us the manifestation of Himself becomes power to enjoy Him.<a name=296:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence, though for convenience sake, I have separated the two points, capacity to enjoy and the manifestations of divine love which reveal it to us to be enjoyed, and this division for other objects is exceedingly important and never lost sight of in Scripture, yet as regards God's dwelling in us it is imperfect.<a name=296:6></a> We cannot here separate the capacity and the means.<a name=296:7></a> Next, then, as regards the means of knowing the divine love, it is first manifested to us in its true nature in Christ's coming into the world to save in love, that had no motive in us; secondly, it is perfect in us in that God dwells in us and sheds it abroad in our heart; thirdly, it is perfected with us in that, even while we are in this world, we are as Christ is with God, so that we have boldness in the day of judgment.<a name=296:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The whole is connected with the subject of the entire epistle as displaying the traits of the divine nature in us by the communication of that eternal life which came down from the Father, so that these things should be true in Him (Christ) and in us, as had been shewn as to righteousness; chapter 2: 29; 3: 1-24.<a name=296:9></a> Only the communication of life is completed here (love being the very nature of God and not an attribute) by the perfect manifestation of that love, and even by the dwelling of God in us.<a name=296:10></a> Righteousness and love are the two great characteristic traits of the divine life, but the latter is what God is.<a name=296:11></a> I do not say God is righteousness, though He is righteous; but I do say He is love.<a name=296:12></a> Righteousness refers to others.<a name=296:13></a> Love is what He is in Himself.<a name=296:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=297>[Page 297]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But to proceed now to the examination of the verses, and first our capacity to enjoy the love of God.<a name=297:1></a> The apostle exhorts the saints to love one another, "for," says he, "love is of God.<a name=297:2></a>" It is so in its nature, for it is what He is.<a name=297:3></a> Hence when a man loves with these divine affections, he is certainly born of God, for he participates in His nature and he knows Him, for he knows what that nature is, for he participates in it.<a name=297:4></a> A mere animal cannot enter into my thoughts as a man, for it has not my nature so as to be able to do so.<a name=297:5></a> If we have the elements of this nature as ours, we are clearly born of God and know Him, for that is His nature.<a name=297:6></a> This is the first essential principle of our capacity for the knowledge of God as love, the participation in this nature, and a most blessed one it is.<a name=297:7></a> Our being born of God, our receiving life is a real thing.<a name=297:8></a> It is our being made partakers of the divine nature.<a name=297:9></a> But for the full completing of this power of knowing God we must bring in not only the divine nature as communicated to us, but God Himself.<a name=297:10></a> This is still connected with its manifestation in loving one another.<a name=297:11></a> No man has seen God at any time.<a name=297:12></a> If we love one another, God dwells in us and His love is perfected in us.<a name=297:13></a> Thus the divine presence becomes the power of knowing God, of His love being perfected in us.<a name=297:14></a> We know that we dwell in God and He in us, because He has given us of His Spirit.<a name=297:15></a> Paul (though, as he is wont, in a more dispensational way) tells us the same truth: "the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.<a name=297:16></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is here said, remark "<i>of</i>" His Spirit, because it is not a display of power -- as it might be when it is simply said His Spirit, as in chapter 3: 24, where consequently it is not said we dwell in Him -- but such a working of the Spirit in the power of divine life that there is communion in the elements of the divine nature.<a name=297:17></a> We love, for He loves.<a name=297:18></a> "He has given us of his Spirit.<a name=297:19></a>" Our being partakers then of the divine nature and God dwelling in us form our capacity for enjoying God in love.<a name=297:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I turn now to those things in which that love is manifested and proved.<a name=297:21></a> First, we have verses 9, 10.<a name=297:22></a> In speaking of him that loves being born of God and knowing God, the soul might have been thrown quite back on itself to search the love there and fall into mysticism.<a name=297:23></a> But the Spirit of God at once, while clearly laying down this partaking of the divine nature, turns the eye of faith to what is wholly outside us, in order to have the proof and learn the character of divine love.<a name=297:24></a> "In this was manifested the love of God to us.<a name=297:25></a>" This comes out in the fullest and most blessed way.<a name=297:26></a> He sent His only-begotten Son into the world that we might live through Him.<a name=297:27></a> I was dead then -- I live through another.<a name=297:28></a> It was pure and perfect love in the mind of God Himself -- the expression of what He is in this love, for there was nothing in me to attract or awaken it.<a name=297:29></a> I was dead.<a name=297:30></a> But God gave the one blessed object of His undistracted and undisturbed love -- His only-begotten Son -- for me when I was dead.<a name=297:31></a> Herein, then, was love, not that we loved God (this was law work), but that He loved us.<a name=297:32></a>

		But this leads to another aspect of the state of the sinner.<a name=298:1></a> He was guilty as well as dead, but Christ came to be the propitiation for our sins.<a name=298:2></a> That is the pure love of God without a motive, but what was in Himself took us up when our state was one of death and guilt through sin.<a name=298:3></a> It was in this state and as being in it we were loved; and the love applied itself to this.<a name=298:4></a> I look for it therefore in God and know its absolute completeness in Him.<a name=298:5></a> There was only a needy undeserving object in me.<a name=298:6></a> It was to my state of sin this love applied.<a name=298:7></a> If I look at the cross where it was displayed, I have no part in it but my sin.<a name=298:8></a> The love of God there was manifested in this that we, dead in sin and guilty, might live through Him, and know that propitiation was made for our sins.<a name=298:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I now turn to the last of the three points I mentioned -- love perfected with us.<a name=298:10></a> It is in this: that as Christ is, so are we.<a name=298:11></a> Love was manifested to us in that He came to us in love when we were in our sins.<a name=298:12></a> It is perfected in that, as Christ is, so are we.<a name=298:13></a> We can say "in this world," for it is here that we learn to know we are, in Him, the righteousness of God in unclouded light.<a name=298:14></a> How can I but have boldness in the day of judgment, when I am as the judge before whom I appear?<a name=298:15></a> And so it is with us.<a name=298:16></a> He comes and fetches us Himself and changes our bodies into glorious bodies by the way; so that, when we appear before Him, we are like Himself in glory.<a name=298:17></a> But this comes about by a real communication of life.<a name=298:18></a> We say we are dead, and our life is hid with Christ in God.<a name=298:19></a> "When Christ who is our life shall appear, then shall we also appear with him in glory.<a name=298:20></a>" Paul, as I have said, treats it more dispensationally, but it is the same truth.<a name=298:21></a> I know I am as Christ is, now that He is gone to my Father and His Father, my God and His God.<a name=298:22></a> Risen, after He had completely put away our sins, He has taken us in the power of resurrection out of the whole case we were in and put us in a new one before God, even that in which He is.<a name=298:23></a> To be as Christ the Son, before God our Father, is all that love could do.<a name=298:24></a> Thus love was manifested in visiting us in our sins; it is perfected in putting us in Christ's position before God, and that livingly.<a name=298:25></a>

		But there is more.<a name=299:1></a> I have reserved for the last what comes second in the chapter, because it speaks of our present enjoyment of this blessing.<a name=299:2></a> I have already referred to it in speaking on the point of our capacity to enjoy.<a name=299:3></a> It is said (verse 12), "No man hath seen God at any time.<a name=299:4></a>" What is the remedy for this seeming impossibility of knowing Him?<a name=299:5></a> The answer here is, If we love one another, God dwelleth in us and His love is perfected in us.<a name=299:6></a> Here is a wonderful way of knowing God, of enjoying in the most perfect way His love.<a name=299:7></a> How great is the intimacy when He dwells in us and gives us to feel immediately the sweetness of His present love!<a name=299:8></a> No intermediate means to assure us of it merely, precious as we have seen these are and absolutely necessary to found our souls in the certainty that He does love us: we know it because we enjoy it directly with Himself.<a name=299:9></a> He has been pleased to come and fill our hearts with the consciousness of His love and to abide there.<a name=299:10></a> He becomes the home and object of confidence for our hearts, because He dwells in our hearts.<a name=299:11></a> He can dwell in us because of Christ's work and our cleanness and righteousness in Him.<a name=299:12></a>

		Here, we can say, is rest -- here is peace, the spring of joy, and the intelligence and pledge of what we shall enjoy with God above.<a name=299:13></a> This passage is the more remarkable through its correspondence with John 1: 18.<a name=299:14></a> The same difficulty is raised.<a name=299:15></a> "No man hath seen God at any time.<a name=299:16></a>" And how is it met there?<a name=299:17></a> "The only-begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.<a name=299:18></a>" Not who <i>was</i>, mark: He who is the one object in whom the Father's love concentrated itself in the most immediate enjoyment and delight -- He has declared Him as He Himself knew Him.<a name=299:19></a> So he that hath seen Him hath seen the Father.<a name=299:20></a> Thus by the Son's coming into the world, we may, through grace, know God.<a name=299:21></a> This, along with the consequent promise of the Spirit on His departure, is the great subject of John's gospel: God made known as the Father by His revelation in the Son.<a name=299:22></a> But how is the same difficulty met here?<a name=299:23></a> God dwells in us.<a name=299:24></a> We know it by this great result of Christ's work that cleansed and justified.<a name=299:25></a> God dwells in us, and makes us enjoy by His presence a love which has allowed nothing to hinder its making itself our own, and has communicated itself to our hearts by dwelling in us, so that we know that nothing hindered its communicating itself to us.<a name=299:26></a> We know it because it is communicated, and God is nearer to us than any other object in the world.<a name=299:27></a> He dwells in us.<a name=299:28></a> Wonderful place given to us!<a name=299:29></a> not an earnest of God's love (there is of the glory), but that love itself perfected in us, because He is there, and whom would we wish but He, and where He is, who shall compete with Him?<a name=299:30></a>

		The other remark I would make is this, that, while the contrast between knowing God as a father and as a judge is most just and most important, it is well for the Christian to remember that in a certain sense it is just as father that He is judge.<a name=300:13></a> As regards final judgment, or the imputation of sin, the Father judges no man, but has committed all judgment to the Son.<a name=300:14></a> The perfect work of Christ, which has put away our sins and thus secured us from the judgment of them as guilt, brings us to call on the Father, who, without respect of persons, judges according to every man's work.<a name=300:15></a> That is what delivers us from judgment as to guilt, brings us into that holy and gracious care which never overlooks anything in the children, and judges it according to the Father's own nature, in the privilege of communion with which the child is fully brought.<a name=300:16></a> The word of Christ was, "Holy Father, keep through thine own name.<a name=300:17></a>" That perfect love of God which has brought us into the enjoyment of itself has not changed Him into whose communion it has brought us, so that He should allow any evil.<a name=300:18></a> Indeed it would not be love.<a name=300:19></a> He deals with us in grace; He warns, chastens, and if He chastises, it is that we should not be condemned with the world; but He allows no evil in His government of His children more than finally in the government of the world.<a name=300:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		For the unbeliever nothing can be more terrible than death.<a name=302:1></a> It is justly and scripturally called "the king of terrors.<a name=302:2></a>" It is the judicial close of the life of the first Adam.<a name=302:3></a> What is beyond?<a name=302:4></a> It is not merely so for the animal nature, though that be true, but the more it is considered in connection with man's moral nature, the more terrible does it become.<a name=302:5></a> Everything in which man has had his home, his thoughts, his whole being employed, is closed and perished for ever.<a name=302:6></a> "When his breath goeth forth, all his thoughts perish.<a name=302:7></a>" Man finds in it an end to every hope, every project, to all his thoughts and plans.<a name=302:8></a> The spring of them all is broken.<a name=302:9></a> The being in which he moved is gone: he can count upon nothing more.<a name=302:10></a> The busy scene in which his whole life has been, knows him no more.<a name=302:11></a> He himself fails and is extinct.<a name=302:12></a> None have to do with him any more as belonging to it.<a name=302:13></a> His nature has given way, powerless to resist this master to which it belongs, and who now assert his dreadful rights.<a name=302:14></a> But this is far from being all.<a name=302:15></a> Man indeed, as man alive in this world, sinks down into nothing.<a name=302:16></a> But why?<a name=302:17></a> Sin has come in; with sin, conscience; with sin, Satan's power: still more with sin, God's judgment.<a name=302:18></a> Death is the expression and witness of all this.<a name=302:19></a> It is the wages of sin, terror to the conscience, Satan's power over us, for he has the power of death.<a name=302:20></a> Can God help here?<a name=302:21></a> Alas, it is His own judgment on sin.<a name=302:22></a> Death seems but as the proof that sin does not pass unnoticed, and is the terror and plague of the conscience, as witness of God's judgment, the officer of justice to the criminal, and the proof of his guilt in the presence of coming judgment.<a name=302:23></a> How can it but be terrible?<a name=302:24></a> It is the seal upon the fall and ruin and condemnation of the first Adam.<a name=302:25></a> And he has nothing but this old nature.<a name=302:26></a> He cannot subsist as a living man before God.<a name=302:27></a> Death is written on him, for he is a sinner, he cannot deliver himself.<a name=302:28></a> He is guilty withal and condemned.<a name=302:29></a> The judgment comes.<a name=302:30></a> But Christ has come in.<a name=302:31></a> He has come into death -- O wondrous truth, the Prince of life!<a name=302:32></a> What is death now for the believer?<a name=302:33></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now mark, reader, the full force of this wonderful, unspeakable, intervention of God.<a name=302:34></a> We have seen death to be man's weakness, the break-up of his being, Satan's power, God's judgment, the wages of sin.<a name=302:35></a> But all this is in connection with the first Adam, whose portion, because of sin, death and judgment are.<a name=302:36></a> We have seen the double character of death; the failure of life, or living power, in man, and the witness of and conductor into the judgment of God.<a name=302:37></a> Christ has been made sin for us; He has undergone death, passed through it as Satan's power and as God's judgment.<a name=302:38></a> Death with its causes, has been met in its every character by Christ.<a name=302:39></a>

		The judgment of God has been fully borne by Him before the day of judgment comes.<a name=303:1></a> Death, as the wages of sin, has been passed through.<a name=303:2></a> It has, as a cause of terror to the soul, in every sense, wholly lost its power for the believer.<a name=303:3></a> The physical fact may take place; for so wholly has Christ put away its power that that is not necessarily the case.<a name=303:4></a> We shall not all sleep, though we shall all be changed.<a name=303:5></a> Desiring, says the apostle, not to "be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.<a name=303:6></a>" Such is the power of life in Christ.<a name=303:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But death has much more than passed away.<a name=303:8></a> Death is ours, says the apostle, as all things are.<a name=303:9></a> By the blessed Lord's entering into it for me, death and judgment too is become my salvation.<a name=303:10></a> The sin, of which it was the wages, has been put away by death itself.<a name=303:11></a> The judgment has been borne for me there.<a name=303:12></a> Death is not terror to my soul; it is not the sign of anger, but the blessedest and fullest proof of love, because Christ came into it.<a name=303:13></a> The very power of the law against me, I am freed from, for it has power over a man only as long as he lives; but in Christ I am dead to the law already.<a name=303:14></a> God has, by death, met sin and judgment already.<a name=303:15></a> In a word, Christ, the sinless One, having come in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, my whole condition, as in the first Adam, has been dealt with -- dealt with so that all its consequences have been righteously undergone; and by death the old man, Satan's power, sin, judgment, mortality itself, which are connected with the old (or sinful) man, are passed and done with for ever.<a name=303:16></a> I live before God now in the One who is risen, after enduring all that belonged to the old for me.<a name=303:17></a> God has dealt with the old man, and all its fruits and consequences for me, in the new, who has taken even the natural consequences attached to it, and gone through its power as in the hand of Satan.<a name=303:18></a> Death has freed me for ever from everything that belonged to, and awaited the old man, as alive.<a name=303:19></a>

		First, condemnation and judgment are entirely over, as a question of the soul's acceptance.<a name=303:20></a> The dreadful ordeal is passed; but by another -- so that it is my deliverance from it according to the righteousness of God.<a name=303:21></a> The floods which destroyed the Egyptians were a wall to Israel on the right hand and on the left, the path of safety out of Egypt.<a name=303:22></a> The salvation of God was there.<a name=303:23></a> Egypt and its oppressive power were left behind them.<a name=303:24></a> Death is deliverance and salvation to us.<a name=303:25></a>

		Secondly, what is it become in practice?<a name=304:1></a> In the power of Christ's resurrection, I am quickened.<a name=304:2></a> He is become my life.<a name=304:3></a> I can dispense, if I may venture so to speak, with the life of the old man; I have that of the new.<a name=304:4></a> But He who, now risen, is my life, passed through death.<a name=304:5></a> I reckon myself dead.<a name=304:6></a> Hence it is never said that we are to die to sin.<a name=304:7></a> The old man does not and would not; the new man has no sin to die to.<a name=304:8></a> We are said to be dead, and commanded to reckon ourselves dead.<a name=304:9></a> Romans 6: 11 -- "Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God, through Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=304:10></a>" Colossians 3: 3 -- "For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God"; and then we are directed to mortify our members which are on the earth, in the power of this new life, and of the Holy Ghost which dwells in us.<a name=304:11></a> I have the title, then, to reckon myself dead.<a name=304:12></a>

		What a gain is death to me in this respect, if really the desires of the new man are in me!<a name=304:13></a> yea, what deliverance and power!<a name=304:14></a> What is dead for faith is the old, hindering, harassing, sinful man; in which, if responsible to God, I was lost, and unable to meet Him.<a name=304:15></a> "When," says the apostle, "we were in the flesh, the motions of sin, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.<a name=304:16></a>" Romans 7: 5.<a name=304:17></a> But Romans 8: 9 -- "Ye are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you.<a name=304:18></a>" The flesh is not our place of standing before God.<a name=304:19></a> We have acknowledged ourselves lost and ruined in it.<a name=304:20></a> That was the standing of the first Adam, and we were in it.<a name=304:21></a> Law applied death to it, judgment, but I am not in it, now, but in the last Adam.<a name=304:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So as regards ordinances, the apostle says, "If ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why as though living [or alive] in the world are ye subject to ordinances?<a name=304:23></a> For faith, we are dead, not alive, in the world.<a name=304:24></a> Hence, also, everything that practically makes us realise this -- trial, suffering, sorrow -- is gain.<a name=304:25></a> It makes morally true and real in our souls that we are dead, and thus delivers from the old man.<a name=304:26></a> "In all these things is the life of my spirit.<a name=304:27></a>" It is disengaged and delivered from the obscuring and deadening influence of the old man.<a name=304:28></a> These sorrows and breaches in life are the details of death morally.<a name=304:29></a> But of the death of what?<a name=304:30></a> Of the old man.<a name=304:31></a> All is gain.<a name=304:32></a>

		Thirdly, if death comes in fact -- the death of what?<a name=305:1></a> Of what is mortal, of the old man.<a name=305:2></a> Does the new risen life die?<a name=305:3></a> It has passed through death in Christ, and this has been realised in us.<a name=305:4></a> It cannot die.<a name=305:5></a> It is Christ.<a name=305:6></a> Hence, in dying, it simply leaves death behind.<a name=305:7></a> It quits what is mortal.<a name=305:8></a> We are absent from the body and present with the Lord.<a name=305:9></a> It was previously outwardly connected with what is mortal; it is no longer so.<a name=305:10></a> We are absent from the body, and present with the Lord.<a name=305:11></a> We depart and are with Christ.<a name=305:12></a> It is true faith that looks for a greater triumph -- we shall be "clothed upon": still this is God's power.<a name=305:13></a> The old man, thank God, never revives.<a name=305:14></a> God, because of His Spirit that dwells in us, will quicken even our mortal bodies.<a name=305:15></a> The life of Christ will be displayed in a glorious body.<a name=305:16></a> We shall be conformed to the image of God's Son, that He may be the first-born among many brethren.<a name=305:17></a> This is the fruit of divine power.<a name=305:18></a> But meanwhile death itself is always deliverance, because, having a new life, it is our being disencumbered from the old man which hinders and hems in our way.<a name=305:19></a> It is our being with Christ.<a name=305:20></a> How sweet and refreshing is the thought!<a name=305:21></a> When once we have seized the difference of the old and new man, the reality of the new life we have received in Christ, the death of the old will be known and felt to be true and real gain.<a name=305:22></a> No doubt, God's time is best, because He alone knows what is needed in the way of discipline and exercise to form our souls for Himself, and He may preserve us to know the power of this life in Christ, so that mortality should be swallowed up without our dying.<a name=305:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But if death is the ceasing of the old man, it is but the ceasing of sin, hindrance, trouble.<a name=305:24></a> We have done with the old man, in which we are guilty before God -- righteously done with it, because Christ has died for us -- for ever done with it, because we live in the power of the new.<a name=305:25></a> Such is death to the believer.<a name=305:26></a> "To depart and to be with Christ is far better.<a name=305:27></a>" As judgment, Christ has taken it; as to the power of sin, it is the death of the very nature it lives in.<a name=305:28></a> As actual mortality, it is deliverance from it to be with Christ in the new man which enjoys Him.<a name=305:29></a> Who as to the proper gain of it, would not die?<a name=305:30></a>

		WHAT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE SAINTS?
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is an unhappy circumstance that many Christians have an idea that responsibility and grace are incompatible (and by grace I mean full saving grace), and if strongly impressed with the necessary truth of the one, they reject the other.<a name=307:1></a> This arises partly from the groundless supposition that responsibility and uncertainty, as to the result, necessarily go together; partly from a confusion between the responsibility of man, sinful man, and the saint's responsibility; and partly from the supposition that responsibility and power must necessarily go together.<a name=307:2></a> All these suppositions are founded on human reasonings, and are all alike groundless.<a name=307:3></a> When a Roman cut off his thumb, so that he could not hold a spear, his responsibility to the State to be a soldier had not ceased, although he had not the power to fulfil his responsibility.<a name=307:4></a> The responsibility flowed from another course, namely, his being a Roman subject or citizen.<a name=307:5></a> If I command my child to come, and it will not, alleged incapacity to come, if true, is not an excuse, if it willed not to come.<a name=307:6></a> Had the will been there, the incapacity might have been removed.<a name=307:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, the elect angels are bound to do God's will, but there is no uncertainty.<a name=307:8></a> God sustains them in will and deed; they delight to do His will, and there is no question at all about the result.<a name=307:9></a> Such a question cannot be raised.<a name=307:10></a> Their delight to do God's will is a part of their existence, in which they are sustained by infinite power, and thus they do it by the strength given to them.<a name=307:11></a> Even Christ Himself was responsible to do His Father's will when He had undertaken it; but there could be no question for a moment as to failure.<a name=307:12></a> His moral being was perfectness, was never anything else, nor could be.<a name=307:13></a> But every created being is responsible; that is, he ought always to do God's will, not his own.<a name=307:14></a> It flows from the necessary and immutable relation of the creature to the Creator.<a name=307:15></a> The creature ought to be, in all its thoughts and ways, what suits the relationship in which it subsists.<a name=307:16></a> All relationships as such have duties in the including thoughts and feelings which correspond to and express the relationship.<a name=307:17></a> Husband and wife, father and child, master and servant, brother and sister, by virtue of the relationship in which they are, ought to be what the word expresses, and all that is implied in it.<a name=307:18></a> The husband is bound to be a husband: that is, he is bound to be what the word means; and so the wife; and the rest.<a name=307:19></a> The relationship is not the duty; but the duty is inseparable from the thought of it.<a name=307:20></a> It will be found that this is not the idea that men have of their responsibility to God (and in part they are right, but that they are so is the consequence of the fall), and in practical result they are wholly wrong.<a name=307:21></a>

		The idea men generally have of responsibility is, that they must live in a certain way to escape judgment, and to gain eternal life.<a name=308:1></a> Now there is a fundamental truth in this, as in every testimony of conscience.<a name=308:2></a> "To those who by patient continuance in well-doing, seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life.<a name=308:3></a>" They who are contentious, and do not obey the truth, will have "indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that doeth evil.<a name=308:4></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As a general principle, we have the knowledge of good and evil (which in itself is a divine perfection, though we have acquired it through the fall), and we know that God approves good and hates evil.<a name=308:5></a> So far as the fact of a natural conscience, thus judging, goes, men are right.<a name=308:6></a> But they do not really believe, till taught of God, that we are in this state as fallen.<a name=308:7></a> Yet all their life betrays it -- I do not merely mean betrays the fact that they are sinners, but the thought that they must gain eternal life, find God's favour, and as they hope in the end come to God, and be happy.<a name=308:8></a> They have not yet found Him then, nor know His thoughts concerning them.<a name=308:9></a> They are in no relationship with God, from which duties flow, save that in which they have already failed; but while they look at God as a judge, they hope to win a place of safety in a happy relationship, by doing their best, and with God's help, and the like.<a name=308:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This may have a more or less religious colouring, but the general idea remains the same; that man has to win the happy relationship to God by his conduct; that he is responsible to please God in his conduct, and by this means inherit (really at bottom, merit, whatever make-weight they may throw in) eternal life and happiness.<a name=308:11></a> God's goodness, Christ's merits, religious duties and ceremonies, come in to help the account, and make up for failures; but account it is, to be decided by the day of judgment, and uncertain till then.<a name=308:12></a> There is no present subsisting relationship with God.<a name=308:13></a> There is no real consciousness of being either saved or lost.<a name=308:14></a> Man, perhaps, is admitted to have been lost, but in some vague way.<a name=308:15></a> Christianity, it is thought, has put an end to this (without, after all, saving him), at least provided men behave themselves properly.<a name=308:16></a> The result is, a man's responsibility is to maintain a conduct required in order to inherit eternal life, and a real present relationship to God is unknown.<a name=308:17></a> It is to be acquired.<a name=308:18></a> Some indeed pretend by ceremonies to place you in a perfect relationship with God but it is lost before it is found or known, so that it has nothing moral in it, and the result is, man has to make it out, after all, by his own conduct.<a name=308:19></a>

		Now, though there is an abstract principle of truth in the groundwork of this idea, the real truth of man's condition and Christianity is wholly set aside by it.<a name=309:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God does love good and hate evil.<a name=309:2></a> There must be a life in true purpose of what is good, to be with Him in bliss; and natural conscience gives a true, if not an adequate sense of good and evil, and of its result.<a name=309:3></a> But these general principles say nothing of my actual state, be I in or out of Christ.<a name=309:4></a> They are true, but they say nothing of me, nor do they tell me what responsibility is, nor what my actual relationship to God is, if I am in one.<a name=309:5></a> Responsibility there is.<a name=309:6></a> The maintenance of responsibility is the maintenance of the rights of God -- of His authority over us.<a name=309:7></a> Where it is objected to, there lies always at the bottom of the objection either the notion that man must have power of his own to be responsible, or that the result is uncertain, which is only another form of the same idea.<a name=309:8></a> But if God creates any being, He creates it in and for the position it is in, whatever be His ultimate purpose, and cannot mean it to abide in inconsistency with the position He has placed it in.<a name=309:9></a> It would be a kind of blasphemy against Him and deny judgment.<a name=309:10></a> No, the angels that kept not their first estate are reserved in chains of darkness.<a name=309:11></a> Man, who kept not his first estate, is passed under death, and excluded from paradise, awaiting also the judgment of God, except as delivered and saved in Christ.<a name=309:12></a> "So he drove out the man.<a name=309:13></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But then the notion man has of responsibility -- that of conduct by which eternal life may be won -- is a mere consequence of our fallen state, of our alienation from God.<a name=309:14></a> It is a labouring, working, to win what we have not, and to gain by our conduct a position in which we are not.<a name=309:15></a> Yet, though this is consequent on the fall, on our distance from God, that distance is not really known.<a name=309:16></a> What man is, as fallen is not really acknowledged: for if such be our position, we are already lost.<a name=309:17></a> We need to be saved.<a name=309:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But responsibility to pursue a course of conduct by which we gain a position or a reward is not the only character of responsibility: nay, it is an unnatural one -- one which flows from disordered relationships.<a name=310:1></a> True, genuine responsibility is the walking according to a position in which we are, and which carries its obligations with it.<a name=310:2></a> The impossibility of losing the position does not alter the responsibility, but makes it perpetual.<a name=310:3></a> A child is always a child to its parent, be he a good child or a disobedient one.<a name=310:4></a> We must get the thought well fixed in our minds, that responsibility connected with labour for the yet uncertain attainment of a relationship in which we are not yet, is an extraordinary, and, so to speak, an unnatural, kind of responsibility.<a name=310:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When we come to the real fact of what a creature is, we shall find that uncertainty does not characterise responsibility so much as we suppose.<a name=310:6></a> If not sustained of God by divine strength, we shall fail; if sustained, we shall not.<a name=310:7></a> Our sense of this dependence is our daily safety.<a name=310:8></a> "Without me ye can do nothing.<a name=310:9></a>" The angels that fell, and Adam, are witnesses of the path of a creature left to his responsibility, untempted or tempted.<a name=310:10></a> The elect angels and renewed men are examples of beings sustained of God in responsibility.<a name=310:11></a> But man is not of this mind.<a name=310:12></a> He is, he says, in a state of probation; he thinks that, though fallen, he may (doubtless, he will say, with God's help) make out the leading a life which will adequately satisfy his responsibility.<a name=310:13></a> Many, of course, will add the goodness of God (as they will feel their path imperfect) and the merits of Christ, to make up what fails.<a name=310:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not my purpose to dwell on this point; but the truth is, what is here called goodness is merely a hope that God will think as lightly of our sins as we do, and as we, for safety's sake, should like Him to do, which is a sure proof of not being converted.<a name=310:15></a> As to the merits of Christ, they are not meant to make sin excusable, but righteousness perfect before God.<a name=310:16></a> His blood cleanses from sin, because God will have none before Him.<a name=310:17></a> He is our righteousness, and it is a divine and perfect one: but He is not to make up ours, so that our failures are forgotten.<a name=310:18></a>

		Then for all weakness and even failure comes the priesthood for it is to the course of this exercise, in which above all our entire dependence on God is brought to light, and the heart is practically purified, that the priesthood of Christ also applies.<a name=317:1></a> It is not exercised to obtain justice for us, nor to bring us to God.<a name=317:2></a> It is founded on perfect righteousness, and the propitiation made for our sins, and is exercised to maintain or restore the communion of the saint, while walking in weakness, with the perfect light into which he is brought, through the rent veil, by that righteousness and propitiation.<a name=317:3></a> Nor do we go to Christ in repentance that He may intercede for us: this would be distrust of the perfect love of the Father, into whose presence He has brought us as children, nor would any one do so really; but He intercedes for us that we may repent.<a name=317:4></a> Our souls are thus restored through grace to communion, or maintained in it.<a name=317:5></a> Intercession is for the saints.<a name=317:6></a> For will, the word is used for weakness and for failure, the grace of priesthood.<a name=317:7></a>

		The other point to which I allude is our encouragement in the course we have to run.<a name=317:8></a> This is afforded us in promises and rewards, to which is annexed the careful and faithful government of the Father, who chastens where needed.<a name=317:9></a> God is sovereign in the revelation of His goodness to the heart, and knows when to grant it; but He has revealed principles of government.<a name=317:10></a> "If a man love me, he shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.<a name=317:11></a>" "If any man love me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come and make our abode with him.<a name=317:12></a>" It is evident that God cannot have communion even with an idle thought.<a name=317:13></a> Christ does not say as to salvation, If a man love Me, God will love him.<a name=317:14></a> "We love him because he first loved us.<a name=317:15></a>" The very characteristic of God's love is, that He loved us when we were sinners.<a name=317:16></a> But though God can visit and restore in grace, His communion is in holiness, and with the obedient; while we are dependent on His grace for both.<a name=317:17></a>

		Here comes too the scripture doctrine of rewards.<a name=317:18></a> As regards righteousness and salvation, reward can have no possible place.<a name=317:19></a> These privileges are in Christ, and perfect.<a name=317:20></a> They are the reward, so to speak, of His labours and work.<a name=317:21></a> So, if one takes reward as the motive for work, he is wholly on false ground.<a name=317:22></a> Love and obedience are the only true motives, as they were in Christ Himself.<a name=317:23></a> "That the world may know," He says, "that I love the Father, and as the Father gave me commandment, so I do.<a name=317:24></a>" And again, "My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.<a name=317:25></a>" But rewards are presented as encouragements in the difficulties which are on the road into which love and obedience bring us.<a name=317:26></a> Thus it could be said of Christ, "Who for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.<a name=317:27></a>" So Moses is approved by the Holy Ghost, saying, "He had respect to the recompense of the reward "; and of all, "Every man shall receive his own reward, according to his own labour.<a name=317:28></a>" The Thessalonians are a crown, a glory, to Paul, as they are not to us.<a name=317:29></a>

		Yet the word keeps steadily before us, that it is of grace, and that, in rewarding His labourers, God does what He will with His own: but in overabounding grace, to sit on Christ's right hand and on His left is given to them for whom it is prepared of His Father.<a name=318:1></a> But as to righteousness and salvation all are alike.<a name=318:2></a> We shall be conformed to the image of God's Son.<a name=318:3></a> But, though sovereign as to the place God gives us, in connection with the Holy Ghost's work in and by us (for it is in connection with this that reward is; it has nothing to do with our righteousness, which is Christ Himself), this sovereignty is exercised in giving the reward according to the labour in gift and calling; so that God's government and the saint's responsibility may be displayed; yet so as that the saint is brought more clearly to say, "Not I, but the grace of God which was in me.<a name=318:4></a>" It is exactly he who has the deepest sense of his responsibility who will the most deeply feel his entire dependence upon grace.<a name=318:5></a> If these questions are mixed up with that of salvation, all is legal and false; but when clear on this, the exercise of the heart in them is most useful, as leading to the sense of dependence, confiding in Him who is able to bless, and delights to do it -- the sense that there is a living God, that we can do nothing of ourselves, nothing without Christ.<a name=318:6></a> It humbles and leads to daily confiding dependence upon God.<a name=318:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The principle I have alluded to above will be found to be universal, namely, that reward is in Scripture never the motive of action, always the encouragement of him who is active from other motives.<a name=318:8></a> Thus, we well know, it was love, eternal, divine love, and thence obedience to His Father, which led Christ in the path of sorrow.<a name=318:9></a> In that path, for the joy that was set before Him, He endured.<a name=318:10></a> Moses visited his brethren because God put it into his heart to prefer suffering with the people of God to a life of ungodly ease in a court.<a name=318:11></a> He endured as seeing Him who is invisible, for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward.<a name=318:12></a>

		In Psalm 19 we have two great witnesses of the power and thoughts of God, First, from verses 1 to 6, the witness creation affords, and especially the heavens: "The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament sheweth his handiwork.<a name=322:3></a>" From verse 6 to the end, the perfection of the law is spoken of -- the question of man's keeping it is not here introduced, it is the perfectness of the law itself which is insisted on, and its value for the soul of man, wherever it brings its light, and the moral power of its instructions.<a name=322:4></a> These witnesses have their own unchangeable character.<a name=322:5></a> Man has been able to corrupt and change the face of the earth, and judgment and destruction have come upon it, death and misery.<a name=322:6></a> What is reached by man is alas!<a name=322:7></a> corrupted by man, But the heavens, and the sun in its course, proclaim with bright and unvarying witness (blessed be God, beyond the reach of man's corrupting hand), the glory of Him that made them, and

		There are three states of suffering in which souls may be first, that which is their portion as sinners under judgment second, the sufferings of a saint for righteousness or love's sake third, suffering as the consequence of sin under the government of God.<a name=330:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This last is not judgment and condemnation for sin, nor is it properly the chastening of a saint, though it may be used as such, and brings exercise of soul in such an one.<a name=330:2></a> Thus the consequence of Adam's transgression was to eat bread in the sweat of his brow, and the woman was to have sorrow in childbearing, both connected with the government of God.<a name=330:3></a> The suffering of the Jews in the latter day will be connected with this kind of suffering, though it will seem as chastening too.<a name=330:4></a> It is more difficult to get hold of this third kind of suffering.<a name=330:5></a> In it God is dealing with a man about his sins without his coming under condemnation.<a name=330:6></a>

		PROMISE FULFILLED AND GOD REVEALED IN GRACE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Luke 4 and 5
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I hardly know whether the thoughts I send you suit your little journal, but trust that all that unfolds the way the blessed Lord presented Himself on the earth, the connection of the Old Testament with the New, and the revealing of God in man upon the earth, will be profitable to some of your readers at least.<a name=337:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I forward to you therefore some remarks on the Gospel of Luke, flowing from thoughts which have arisen in my mind while lately reading it.<a name=337:2></a> There are two great subjects in the life of the blessed Lord which Luke brings out: the fulfilment of promise, and the revelation of God in grace in the "Son of man.<a name=337:3></a>" These are presented to us in the history in a very interesting way.<a name=337:4></a> I will notice this as displayed in chapters 4 and 5.<a name=337:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 4 the Spirit of God has shewn us the blessed One led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil, victorious in trial, as the first man had failed in it.<a name=337:6></a> He returns in the power of the Spirit into Galilee, having first bound the strong man.<a name=337:7></a> Let me remark here, in passing, how faithfulness in trial and temptation shews the power of the Spirit as much as the energy of action.<a name=337:8></a> Jesus was led by the Spirit to be tempted, overcame Satan by the word through the Spirit, and returned in its power, working miracles and casting out devils.<a name=337:9></a> But the power has been exercised all through the temptation, only in standing fast.<a name=337:10></a> See Ephesians 6.<a name=337:11></a> Therein He had overcome Satan, baffled his power, really bound the strong man, and then had only to spoil his goods.<a name=337:12></a> He used, too, the weapon we have to use, the word of God; only we must remark that we learn from Ephesians 6, that to use the word we must first have all the defensive armour, that is, the state of the soul must be right, Christ, of course, was perfect and used it perfectly.<a name=337:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the measure of our spirituality and uprightness we shall be able to wield this blessed weapon.<a name=337:14></a> But here even the sword was a defensive weapon.<a name=337:15></a> He met the wiles of Satan by it.<a name=337:16></a> Whatever reasonings or scriptures Satan may use, if we are spiritual enough to use it, the word of God suffices to confound him.<a name=337:17></a>

		But to turn to my more direct subject.<a name=338:1></a> The Lord now stood as man, anointed of the Holy Ghost, having overcome Satan, to make good the grace and goodness of God amongst men, and specially first amongst the Jews; but the glory of His divine Person was not to be hid.<a name=338:2></a> But first He presents Himself as the anointed Man, fulfilling all that had been promised in grace.<a name=338:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I must remark another point.<a name=338:4></a> The Lord looks for rejection and this it will be seen is the case in both the characters in which He presents Himself.<a name=338:5></a> First, then, as the anointed Man.<a name=338:6></a> "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the broken -- hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord," Thus He presents Himself as the fulfiller of promise, announcing the favourable and gracious time of God's mercy in His own person.<a name=338:7></a> "This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.<a name=338:8></a>" But at the same time He tells them that He will be rejected.<a name=338:9></a> A prophet has not honour in his own country, But He adds that grace, as grace, passed beyond the limits of the Jews; that God was sovereign in His goodness, and of old had sent help to two Gentiles, while many remained in sorrow in rebellious Israel.<a name=338:10></a> This the haughty Jews would not bear, and, gracious as His words had been, they are now ready to destroy Him for preaching a grace which Israel might lose all part in, as rejecting Him, and the Gentile get blessing by.<a name=338:11></a> They are ready to destroy Him, but it was not the time, and He passed through the midst of them.<a name=338:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now see the character in which the devils own Him; how it meets this character in which He was really come.<a name=338:13></a> How sad a picture!<a name=338:14></a> Devils perforce own Him; men reject Him with hatred.<a name=338:15></a> It is remarkable how these evil spirits own Him according to the truth (as we may remember the spirit of divination did Paul), but surely only as dreading, and, if they could have done so, avoiding His power.<a name=338:16></a> "Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth?<a name=338:17></a> art thou come to destroy us?<a name=338:18></a> I know thee who thou art; the holy One of God.<a name=338:19></a>" It was the reluctant owning of a power they could not avoid.<a name=338:20></a> The time was not come to cast them into the pit, but to deliver man.<a name=338:21></a> They came out of the man at Jesus's word.<a name=338:22></a>

		But this title (the holy One) was a prophetic one of Jesus; and this title as summing up all the mercies of God.<a name=339:1></a> It is unfolded in Psalm 89.<a name=339:2></a> The word "mercies" in the first verse of that psalm is the same as "holy One" in verse 19.<a name=339:3></a> "Holy One" in verse 18 is quite different.<a name=339:4></a> Mercy was to be built up for ever, the psalm declares.<a name=339:5></a> How?<a name=339:6></a> "Thou spakest in vision of [not "to," I think, but about, as we see that of the prophecy, Psalm 72, "A psalm about Solomon"] thy holy One," Thy gracious One, in whom help and mercy are summed up.<a name=339:7></a> "I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people.<a name=339:8></a> I have found David my servant," etc.<a name=339:9></a> Here, no doubt, the immediate subject is David; but in the mind of God a greater, even Christ, is here.<a name=339:10></a> The evil spirit owns that this holy One is there in the Person of Jesus of Nazareth.<a name=339:11></a> Help was indeed laid upon the mighty One, who having overcome Satan wholly, could have delivered man from all the miserable fruits of his power, even death itself; but man would have none of Him.<a name=339:12></a> He must be redeemed or lost.<a name=339:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next, in chapter 4, when healing many, the devils who are cast out own Him as the Christ the Son of God.<a name=339:14></a> This was owning His title as promised to Israel in Psalm 2; but which also witnessed to His rejection.<a name=339:15></a> Thus the power of present delivering goodness, in the promised One, was there.<a name=339:16></a> He is owned the holy One of God in whom mercies came to Israel, as the Christ and Son of God spoken of in Psalm 2.<a name=339:17></a> But in His own country He is not received.<a name=339:18></a> The prejudices and passions of man rise up against grace and this gracious One, while the devils own Him, but through dread; a strange but solemn picture!<a name=339:19></a> They could not but know Him.<a name=339:20></a> But what is knowledge when only such?<a name=339:21></a> Those He really came to would not receive Him.<a name=339:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 5 He is seen in another character.<a name=339:23></a> He reveals and is, Jehovah.<a name=339:24></a> In the miraculous draught of fishes He makes Himself known to the conscience of Peter.<a name=339:25></a> He sees the Lord in it and acknowledges himself a sinful man.<a name=339:26></a> unfit for His presence.<a name=339:27></a> This is always the effect of the revelation of God to us, and indeed of nothing else.<a name=339:28></a> Jesus speaks words of grace, "Fear not.<a name=339:29></a>" From henceforth he should catch men.<a name=339:30></a> In what follows He heals the leper, which was Jehovah's work alone.<a name=339:31></a> But there was a special circumstance connected with this, full of blessed significance.<a name=339:32></a> The leper recognised His power, but was not sure of His goodness or willingness to help him.<a name=339:33></a> "Lord [he says], if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.<a name=339:34></a>" The Lord does not merely say He is willing, He puts forth His hand and touches him.<a name=339:35></a> Now, if a man touched a leper he too was unclean, and must be put out of the camp.<a name=339:36></a> But here was a divine Person come down, Jehovah, who could cleanse; One who could say, "I will"; "be"; One who could not be defiled, but had for that very reason come down to touch the defiled one, and remove the defilement.<a name=339:37></a> He was Jehovah, come as man, to touch, so to speak, the sinner in grace.<a name=339:38></a>

		Jesus was One whose holiness was so perfect, as God become man, that He could carry divine love to the vilest; carry it wherever a need or a sorrow was, and as love touch the defiled, not to become so, but to heal.<a name=340:1></a> It Is a wonderful picture of what Christ, Jehovah, present to heal was in this world.<a name=340:2></a> This revealing Himself to the conscience, and doing a divine work in love, in what was a figure of cleansing from sin, mark Him out as Jehovah in the world in grace.<a name=340:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He withdraws Himself into the wilderness and prays; ever the dependent, as the obedient and victorious Man.<a name=340:4></a> But other elements of divine grace are yet to be observed here.<a name=340:5></a> He was sitting with doctors of the law, ready to object to grace, and ignorant of how the Son of God had in manhood visited this sinful world in the power and title of divine grace.<a name=340:6></a> One sick of the palsy is brought to Him by faith.<a name=340:7></a> He goes to the root of all sorrow, and says, "Thy sins be forgiven thee.<a name=340:8></a>" The question is not here how through the precious death of Christ forgiveness was consistent with divine righteousness and glorified it.<a name=340:9></a> What is here revealed, is Jehovah present in full unmingled grace.<a name=340:10></a> As the testimony and witness of this, the Lord does what is ascribed to Jehovah in Psalm 103, along with the forgiveness of sins.<a name=340:11></a> "Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases.<a name=340:12></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		Lastly, the Lord shews, as the friend of publicans and sinners, that He had come in sovereign grace to gather in the power of good, not looking for it in man.<a name=340:13></a> But thus also He must be rejected.<a name=340:14></a> This new wine, for it was so, could not be put into old bottles; Judaism could not receive and be the vessel of sovereign grace; nor could those who were used to Judaism easily receive the new wine of the gospel and spirit of God.<a name=340:15></a> And so it ever is in all ages.<a name=340:16></a>

		THE RESURRECTION

		1 Corinthians 15
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The resurrection after all is that which is the full and perfect deliverance from the whole effect and consequence of sin.<a name=341:1></a> At the same time it shews that what God has predestinated us to is an entirely new estate and condition of things altogether.<a name=341:2></a> Nothing is more important than that we should clearly apprehend what it is God is about; whether He is correcting the old thing, or setting up an entirely new thing.<a name=341:3></a> Now the resurrection shews that God is not bringing about a modification of the scene in which we are, but that He is bringing in a totally new power.<a name=341:4></a> The discernment of this has the most important effect upon the way of life, the modes of seeking to do good, the objects and efforts of Christians.<a name=341:5></a> Christ went about doing good, and we are of course to follow His example; but what of the state of things around did Christ correct or set right when down here?<a name=341:6></a> Nothing!<a name=341:7></a> The very result of the Lord's coming into the midst of the Jewish nation was just this, that they rejected, hated, and crucified the Prince of life and Lord of glory.<a name=341:8></a> The Lord Jesus went about doing good, but seemingly in vain.<a name=341:9></a> Still none of God's counsels have failed; but as to the outward result, the Lord said, "I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for nought," Isaiah 49: 5.<a name=341:10></a> And so far as the outward scene went, in which He laboured, there was no kind of restoration; for the more love Christ manifested, it only brought out more fully man's hatred to Him.<a name=341:11></a> "For my love they are mine adversaries.<a name=341:12></a>"

		The resurrection introduces an entirely new scene, so that Paul says, "Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away, behold all things are become new.<a name=341:13></a>" Now it is a very difficult thing for men to submit their minds to this truth, because it plainly tells man that, in himself as man, he is totally and utterly ruined.<a name=341:14></a> It is quite true, and I fully admit, that naturally man has great and wonderful faculties; and faculties which, it may be, will be much more developed than they now are.<a name=341:15></a> But still, with all this, man morally is utterly ruined and lost.<a name=341:16></a> Paul opens out in this chapter what the character and power of resurrection is, the resurrection of the just being the subject of it, although that of the unjust is also glanced at.<a name=341:17></a> It is not merely God acting in sovereign power, which can take a dead thing out of the state of death; but by virtue of association with the life of Christ we have participation in Christ's resurrection.<a name=341:18></a> It is not only that we are blessed, but blessed with Christ.<a name=341:19></a> If He lives, we also live together with Him.<a name=341:20></a> "Because I live, ye shall live also.<a name=341:21></a>" If He is the righteousness of God, "we are made the righteousness of God in him.<a name=341:22></a>" If He is heir of glory, we are "joint-heirs together with him," and "where he is, there shall we also be.<a name=341:23></a>" If He is the Son, we are sons also.<a name=341:24></a> "I ascend to my Father and your Father.<a name=341:25></a>" We are put, through grace, into this wonderful place of sons so that it is a real thing; and having thus been brought by adoption from a state of sin to that of sons, the Holy Ghost is given to us as the power of our enjoyment of it.<a name=341:26></a> Such is the marvellous place into which we are brought, even that of everlasting companionship with Christ, "members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.<a name=341:27></a>" Man down here on the earth "disquieteth himself in vain"; for wonderful as his natural faculties may be, as soon as his "breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth, in that very day his thoughts perish.<a name=341:28></a>" What then becomes of his wondrous faculties?<a name=341:29></a> All is gone; for there is no fruit whatever reaped by himself.<a name=341:30></a> The man may have directed the world, but what of that, if death comes in and writes nothingness on all his powers?<a name=341:31></a> Another may come after him and improve upon what he has done, but it is all gone as regards himself for ever, although the man has a moral responsibility in connection with it all.<a name=341:32></a>

		Christ had an unchangeable life as Son of God; but He died as a man; for there was complete evidence given through many incontrovertible proofs that He was really a dead man, and that He was raised from the dead and seen of "witnesses chosen before of God.<a name=343:1></a>" How entirely Christ, by the grace of God, tasted death for every man is seen by His being raised from the dead.<a name=343:2></a> All the gospel rests on the resurrection of Christ, There is no gospel at all, unless there is the resurrection.<a name=343:3></a> This is a point of the deepest interest, shewing how really Christ entered into the case.<a name=343:4></a> So truly was Christ dead in consequence of our sins, that if He did not rise from the dead, then all is utterly gone for ever, But so completely was Christ a dead man for us, that if He is not raised from the dead, no man can ever be raised.<a name=343:5></a> And if dead people are not raised, then is Christ not raised.<a name=343:6></a> Yet we know He could not be holden of death; that were impossible.<a name=343:7></a> It is most important for us clearly to see and understand this, that our faith and hope may be "in God which raiseth the dead.<a name=343:8></a>" Thus everything that could possibly come between the sinner and God has been entirely removed -- the burden of sin on the soul -- God's wrath against sin -- Satan's power -- the weakness of man in death.<a name=343:9></a> Christ put Himself under all this.<a name=343:10></a> "He bore our sins," for He cried "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?<a name=343:11></a>" By grace Christ put Himself entirely in our place.<a name=343:12></a> He who knew no sin was made sin for us.<a name=343:13></a> All my sins are therefore entirely gone: He bore them all on the cross and went down under the power of death, and rose again without them.<a name=343:14></a> Has death any more power over Him?<a name=343:15></a> No, for He is risen in the power of an endless life.<a name=343:16></a> But still He has been there on account of our sins, and has entirely put away the sin that took Him there, having risen without them.<a name=343:17></a> What then can there be between me and God which Christ has not entirely put away?<a name=343:18></a> Nothing.<a name=343:19></a> Seeing then that Christ has so completely acted out this condition before God, death is no longer death to me; it has lost its power and its terror too; for now death to me is simply "departing to be with Christ.<a name=343:20></a>" It is to be "absent from the body, present with the Lord"; it is but the getting rid of a mortal body.<a name=343:21></a>

		The power of the resurrection is distinctive; and it is of great importance to see this.<a name=344:1></a> God's eye rested on the blessed One who had glorified Him about man's sin; so that He takes Him from amongst the dead up to Himself.<a name=344:2></a> We see a whole course of sin had gone on to the full accomplishment even of putting God's Son to death on the cross.<a name=344:3></a> But over all this evil Christ gained so complete a victory, and so thoroughly glorified every attribute of God about man's sin, that God's eye rested on this blessed and righteous One with complete satisfaction.<a name=344:4></a> And thus, as He said, was the world convinced of righteousness, "because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more.<a name=344:5></a>" But now, we who believe see Him -- that is, by faith; being quickened together with Him, having all trespasses forgiven us.<a name=344:6></a> For God does not raise a saint to condemn him -- no; but to make him a partaker of all Christ is.<a name=344:7></a> For Christ has accomplished a righteousness on which God has set His seal, in that He raised Him from the dead.<a name=344:8></a> God's eye being fixed on this accomplished righteousness, this object of His love, He took Him up to Himself; and having quickened us together with Christ, we are made partakers of it.<a name=344:9></a> Were there no resurrection, it would be complete abandonment by God; for He is not the God of the dead but of the living.<a name=344:10></a> And "if in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.<a name=344:11></a>" For if Christ be not raised, our preaching is vain; we have not been preaching the truth of the gospel, but preaching a lie: and your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.<a name=344:12></a>

		But now comes a full burst of testimony to this accomplished work: "Now is Christ risen from the dead.<a name=344:13></a>" Thus the righteous and beloved One is raised out of this scene into an entirely new one, even that of becoming the first-fruits of them that slept.<a name=344:14></a> For if Christ be raised, His saints must be raised, as a Head cannot be raised without a body: it would be monstrous.<a name=344:15></a> There is then the broad statement in John 17, "Thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.<a name=344:16></a>" The resurrection comes in, not by the power of God only, but also by man.<a name=344:17></a> "For since by man came death, by man also came resurrection from the dead.<a name=344:18></a>" It is the Man Christ Jesus coming in in power.<a name=344:19></a> Every created thing, the whole universe, is to be wholly put under this righteous Man, this now glorified Man, the second Adam.<a name=344:20></a> He only is excepted which did put all things under Him -- that is, God the Father.<a name=344:21></a>

		The failure of man, of the church, even, does not touch the source of divine grace -- the goodness of God.<a name=348:1></a> From Adam downwards everything placed in the hand of man has failed; but this very failure and evil of man has been made the opportunity by God of shewing our more and richer grace.<a name=348:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He judges the failure, and then presents an object of hope.<a name=348:3></a> When Adam sinned, "the seed of the woman" was promised.<a name=348:4></a> When the law was broken and Israel failed, prophetic testimony came in and all the promises of the Messiah.<a name=348:5></a> <i>Promise</i> is that on which faith can rest when everything else fails.<a name=348:6></a>

		Times of declension and unfaithfulness in the body give occasion for brighter manifestations of grace in individuals, who under such circumstances are brought into the enjoyment of close and blessed communion with God.<a name=348:7></a> See Elijah, Moses, etc.<a name=348:8></a> Moses had to leave the camp (Exodus 33), because the golden calf was there, and to go outside: but in so doing he got into a place of greater nearness to God than he had ever known before -- "And the Lord spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend.<a name=348:9></a>"

		At the beginning of the gospel dispensation the energy of the Holy Ghost was so plainly manifested in the church, that man was nothing, God everything.<a name=348:10></a> This is of course true to faith all through the dispensation, But then, even after these epistles to the churches were given, things had become sadly changed.<a name=348:11></a> The Lord, in this and the following chapter, turns His eye to that which should have been "the place of righteousness," and behold "iniquity is there"; therefore it is necessary that judgment begin at the house of God, as it is said, "the Lord shall judge his people.<a name=348:12></a>" At first this is in the way of testimony against the evil; for the Lord ever warns before He executes judgment, and in judgment He remembers mercy.<a name=348:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord takes notice of every circumstance, every shade of difference, in these churches, as also in individuals in them; thus shewing that He is not indifferent as to the state of His people by the way -- their daily steps, because He has secured blessing to them at the end.<a name=348:14></a> His love is not a careless love.<a name=348:15></a> We have all, more or less, lost sight of the judgment exercised by the Lord in "his own house," and it is too frequently supposed that, because the salvation of the saint is a sure thing, God is indifferent about character here.<a name=348:16></a> But to love this is impossible.<a name=348:17></a> A child would be sure eventually to inherit his father's property, but then what parent would be satisfied (if he loved his child) without knowing that?<a name=348:18></a> Would he not anxiously train him up, watching every development of his mind and faculties, and ordering all things in his education, so as best to fit him for his future destination?<a name=348:19></a> How much more is this the way of the Lord's love with His children!<a name=348:20></a> This is for our comfort and blessing -- there is wonderful comfort in seeing it to be the spring of all God's dealings with us; but at the same time it is intended to act strongly on our conscience in the way of warning.<a name=348:21></a>

		We have to remember that the church, and indeed every individual saint, is set in the place of direct conflict with Satan, the more so because of the high standing and privilege given us in Christ.<a name=349:1></a> Now it may be in triumphant victory, as it is said, "the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly.<a name=349:2></a>" To effect the purpose of God's glory, coming in as it will by-and-by when He shall establish His kingdom, we know that Satan must be really fully dethroned; but in order, even now (ere that time comes), that we realise our blessings in heavenly places (Ephesians 1: 3), it is needful he should be practically dethroned from the heart through the power of the Holy Ghost.<a name=349:3></a> Although it is quite certain that he shall be bruised under our feet "shortly" (there is no doubt, of course, about the power of the Lord Jesus to do it), yet the certainty of Christ's final victory with the church should not lessen our sense of the power of the enemy in the meantime.<a name=349:4></a> This is so great as to make constant watchfulness necessary, for without it we shall be giving him a direct handle against ourselves.<a name=349:5></a> The flesh, by which Satan works, is still present, and it needs to be "mortified.<a name=349:6></a>" Perhaps we have often been surprised at grievous falls in ourselves or others; but if we fail to watch against the flesh, it is not really at all surprising such should be the result.<a name=349:7></a> Habitual faithfulness in judging the flesh in little things is the secret of not falling.<a name=349:8></a>

		The promise at the close of each of these messages to the churches is addressed to "him that overcometh.<a name=349:9></a>" As stated above, it has ever been in times of general failure that the promises of God have been most graciously brought out, and that His faithful ones have had increased communion, being thrown thereby more entirely upon Himself.<a name=349:10></a> If, through any measure of faithfulness, we find ourselves in trial and exercise of soul because of corporate general declension, that is just the very time we should look for more intimate revelation of the grace of God and of His love to our hearts.<a name=349:11></a> And this will be not only in giving us clear and firm apprehension of the promises of God, but also in a fuller knowledge of all that in Christ which is suited to be drawn upon by our need.<a name=349:12></a> He that is faithful may ever count on this.<a name=349:13></a> The principle is clearly seen in these epistles, both in the promises, and also in the different character in which the Lord Jesus presents Himself according to the circumstances of each "church.<a name=349:14></a>" It is very sad to see man (whether it be in Israel, the church, or any other place) always failing; but still the faithful ones in the midst of failure find a fuller, deeper revelation of the grace of God, even through it, than when all is going on well.<a name=349:15></a> This is most blessed!<a name=349:16></a>

		From the message to "the church of Ephesus" (verse 1-7), we see that there had already been failure there -- failure in its "first love.<a name=350:1></a>" And therefore, instead of being spoken to (as Paul's Epistle to the same church) of the high and holy things connected with the church at large, or of being addressed as occupying the place of witness and testimony to others, the eye has to be turned inward to its own state, a clear proof how far it had declined.<a name=350:2></a> When a church or an individual Christian is walking in the light, and not grieving the Spirit, there can then be entrance into the privileges belonging to the whole church of God; but when the Spirit is grieved, there can no longer be this revelation: each is shut up in its own particular state and judged.<a name=350:3></a> The message is from Him "that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, and that walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks" (verse 1), the Lord taking the place of examination and judgment.<a name=350:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The overcoming spoken Of (verse 7), and indeed throughout the chapter, is not so much the overcoming of the world and that which was without, as of all the evil discovered to be within.<a name=350:5></a> There had been a leaving of the "first love"; and when there is diminution of this in the smallest degree, the Lord says, "I have somewhat against thee" (verse 4).<a name=350:6></a> He takes notice of the least failure.<a name=350:7></a> Whenever it has begun He speaks of excision, and inflicts it too unless there be repentance.<a name=350:8></a> We always find that in judging God goes back to the original sin.<a name=350:9></a> When Stephen charges the Jews (Acts 7), although they had crucified the Lord Jesus, that which he goes back to is their first sin, of making the golden calf.<a name=350:10></a>

		And thus with an individual Christian.<a name=351:1></a> There is often failure when the first glow of zeal is gone off.<a name=351:2></a> At such a time, we have not only to see where the failure is manifested, but when it was we first went away from the Lord, and we shall very generally find it to have been in getting out of communion this leaving of the "first love.<a name=351:3></a>" Well, this should not be and is not necessary; but even when it is the case, the grace of the Lord will still be found greater than all the evil that is discovered to be within.<a name=351:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We see peculiarity of blessing (verse 7).<a name=351:5></a> It is to the eye and ear of faith that the Lord brings out the promise of "the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.<a name=351:6></a>" He sees the church failing in fellowship with God, and therefore sets before it "the tree of life," and "the paradise of God.<a name=351:7></a>" It is God's paradise: blessed security!<a name=351:8></a> there can be no declension there.<a name=351:9></a> It was man's paradise first; failure came in, and lest he should take of the fruit of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever, "God drove out the man": but now the promise to "him that overcometh" is to eat of the tree of life freely, and in security in "the paradise of God.<a name=351:10></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		Whilst we feed on the fruit of it, "the leaves of the tree will be for the healing of the nations," Revelation 22: 2.<a name=351:11></a> When the church is in glory, it will not lose the character of grace.<a name=351:12></a> God gives us now to feed on the bread of life; our first delight must be in God, but then, secondarily, we have the joy of love in being made ministers of blessing unto others.<a name=351:13></a> Well, so also in glory our portion will be grace, but we shall be able likewise to minister in grace to others.<a name=351:14></a>

		In the case of "the church in Smyrna" (verse 8-11), they had begun the downward course; but the Lord had come in most graciously, and arrested the decay by tribulation.<a name=351:15></a> I say most graciously, for one goes wonderfully quickly down hill unless a strong hand stop us.<a name=351:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The souls were in tribulation, poverty, and persecution, and how does the Lord reveal Himself?<a name=351:17></a> As the One whom nothing can touch, not all the clouds and storms, the difficulties and trials affect (like the sun, bright before the storm and bright after it) the FIRST and the LAST (verse 8).<a name=351:18></a> "Yes," it may be said, this is true of Him; but then the storm rolls over us, and threatens to overwhelm: we have no power against it.<a name=351:19></a> But He reveals Himself not only as "the First and the Last" -- the One therefore on whom we may lean for eternal strength -- but also as "He who was dead, and is alive.<a name=351:20></a>" He says, as it were, I have gone through it all, I have entered into the weakness of man, and undergone all the power that could come against it, all the trials even unto death -- I have entered into everything, for I have died, and yet I am alive.<a name=351:21></a>

		There is nothing that the Lord has not gone through: death is the last effort of Satan's power; it ends there for the sinner, as well as for the saint.<a name=352:1></a> The unconverted even are out of Satan's power when they die: if they die in their sins, of course they come under the judgment of God, but Satan has no power in hell.<a name=352:2></a> He may have pre-eminence in misery, but no power there (his reigning is some poet's dream, it is here he reigns, and that by means of the pride and vanity, the evil passions and idleness, of men); he is "the ruler of the darkness of this world," not of the next.<a name=352:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But whatever may be the extent of power which he seeks now to exercise against the children of God, the Lord says, I have been under it -- I have been dead.<a name=352:4></a> Therefore, it is impossible for us to be in any circumstance of difficulty or of trial through which Jesus has not been.<a name=352:5></a> He has met the power of Satan there; and yet He is alive.<a name=352:6></a> And now He "is alive for evermore," not only to sustain us while passing through the storm, but to feel for, to sympathise, as having experienced more than all the heaviness of the circumstances in which we are.<a name=352:7></a> He can pity with the utmost tenderness, for He came into the very centre of our misery.<a name=352:8></a> But the weakness of God is stronger than man, and though Christ was dead, yet he is alive.<a name=352:9></a>

		But at the same time that He thus warns, there is plenty of encouragement given -- promises suited to counteract their temptations (verse 17).<a name=355:6></a> Were they tempted "to eat of things sacrificed unto idols" with the world?<a name=355:7></a> the promise to "him that overcometh" is, "I will give him to eat of the hidden manna.<a name=355:8></a>" If they had grace to separate themselves from the open evil, He would reward them with the unseen blessing of the heavenly places, there should be this feeding on "the hidden manna.<a name=355:9></a>" Again: were they tempted to deny the name and faith of Christ?<a name=355:10></a> the promise given is "a white stone, and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth save he that receiveth it": to keep them from slipping back into the world, to strengthen them in incurring, as must needs be in separation, the disapprobation of so many, He promises them inward blessings to cheer their hearts.<a name=355:11></a>

		PHILIPPIANS 2 AND 3
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If it suits your little publication,<a href="#361:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> I send you some brief thoughts on Philippians 2 and 3.<a name=361:1></a> The whole epistle is a very remarkable one, and raises the Christian to his highest condition of matured experience; but on this I will say a few words before I close.<a name=361:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I turn now to the above chapters.<a name=361:3></a> The former gives us Christian character, as men speak -- Christian grace; the latter, the energy which carries the Christian above present things.<a name=361:4></a> The former speaks of Christ coming down and humbling Himself; the latter, of His being on high, and of the prize of our calling above.<a name=361:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A little careful attention will shew that chapter 2 throughout presents the gracious fruits connected with the heart's study of the blessed Lord's humiliation, and of its imbibing the spirit of it; and that chapter 3 gives the picture of that blessed energy which counts the world as dross, overcomes on the way, and looks forward to the time when the Lord's power shall have subdued even the power of death in us and all its effects, and change us into glory.<a name=361:6></a> We need both these principles and the motives connected with them.<a name=361:7></a> We may see much of the energy of Christianity in a believer, and rejoice in it; while another displays much graciousness of character but no energy that overcomes the world.<a name=361:8></a> Where the flesh, or mere natural energy, mixes itself in our path with the divine energy, the way of the sincere and devoted Christian requires to be corrected by the former; more inward communion and gracious likeness to Christ, more feeding on the bread which came down from heaven.<a name=361:9></a> Besides displaying Christ, it would give weight and seriousness to his activity -- make it more real and divine.<a name=361:10></a> On the other hand, one who maintains a gracious deportment and judges, perhaps, what he sees to be fleshly in the energy of another fails himself in that energy, and casts a slur on that which is really of God in his brother.<a name=361:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Oh that we knew how to be a little self-judging and complete in our Christian path; that we had nearness enough to Christ to draw from Him all grace and all devotedness, and correct in ourselves whatever tends to mar the one or the other!<a name=361:12></a> Not that I expect that all Christians will ever have alike all qualities.<a name=361:13></a> I do not think it is the mind of God they should have.<a name=361:14></a> They have to keep humbly in their place.<a name=361:15></a> The eye cannot -- it is not meant it should -- say to the hand, I have no need of thee; nor the hand to the feet.<a name=361:16></a> Completeness is in Christ alone.<a name=361:17></a> Mutual dependence and completing one another under His grace is the order of His body.<a name=361:18></a> It is hard for some active minds to think so; but it is true humility and contentedness to be nothing and to serve, and to esteem others more excellent than ourselves -- an easy practical way to arrive at it.<a name=361:19></a> They have the thing in which we are deficient.<a name=361:20></a> Our part is to do what the Lord has set us to do, to serve and count Him all, for in truth He does it; and to be glad to be nothing when we have quietly done His will, that He may be all.<a name=361:21></a>

		But to return to my chapters: that chapter 2 gives us the humiliation of Christ is evident.<a name=362:1></a> We are to pursue its application.<a name=362:2></a> But the way it is introduced is very beautiful.<a name=362:3></a> The Philippians, who had already early in the gospel history shewn grace in this respect, had thought of Paul in his distant prison; and Epaphroditus, giving effect to their love, and full of gracious zeal, had not regarded his life to accomplish this service, and minister to the apostle's wants.<a name=362:4></a> The apostle makes a touching use of this love of the Philippians, while owning it as the refreshings of Christ.<a name=362:5></a> He had found "consolation in Christ, comfort of love, fellowship of the Spirit, bowels and mercies," in the renewed testimony of the affection of the Philippians.<a name=362:6></a> His heart was drawn out also toward them, If they would make him perfectly happy, they must be thoroughly united and happy amongst themselves.<a name=362:7></a> How graciously, with what delicate feeling, he turns to note their faults and dangers here in association with their expressions of love to him!<a name=362:8></a> How calculated to win and to make any Euodiases and Syntyches ashamed of disputes where grace is thus at work!<a name=362:9></a> Then he speaks of the means of walking in this spirit.<a name=362:10></a> Every one should think of the spiritual gifts and advantages of His brother as well as of his own.<a name=362:11></a> To do this he must have the mind that was in Christ.<a name=362:12></a> This leads us to the great principle of the chapter.<a name=362:13></a>

		Christ is set forth in full contrast with the first Adam.<a name=362:14></a> The first when in the form of man set up by robbery to be equal with God: "Ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.<a name=362:15></a>" And he became disobedient unto death.<a name=362:16></a> But the blessed One, being in the form of God, made Himself of no reputation, and in the form of a servant was obedient unto death.<a name=362:17></a> He was really God, as Adam was really man; but the point here is to note the condition and status each was in respectively, and out of which, in ambition or grace, he came.<a name=362:18></a> For Christ was truly God still, when He had taken the form of a man; but He had taken the form of a servant, and was too really a man and a servant in grace.<a name=362:19></a> Christ in love humbled Himself; Adam in selfishness sought to be exalted and was abased.<a name=362:20></a> Christ humbled Himself, and was as man exalted.<a name=362:21></a> It was not merely that He bore patiently the insults of men, but He humbled Himself.<a name=362:22></a> This was love.<a name=362:23></a> There were two great steps in it.<a name=362:24></a> Being in the form of God, He took the form of man; and as man He humbled Himself, and was obedient unto death, and that, the death of the cross.<a name=362:25></a> This is the mind which is to be in us -- love making itself nothing to serve others.<a name=362:26></a> Love delights to serve; self likes to be served.<a name=362:27></a> Thus the true glory of a divine character is in lowliness, human pride in selfishness.<a name=362:28></a> In the former, in us, both gracious affections and devotedness and counting on gracious affections in others are developed, a source of genuine joy and blessing to the church.<a name=362:29></a>

		In following the chapter, we shall see this taught in general, and produced unconsciously, as it were, in details.<a name=363:1></a> First, after stating the exaltation and glory of Christ as Lord, he presses obedience (perfectly shewn in Christ), than which nothing is more lowly, for we have no will in it; and having directly to do with the power of the enemy, without the shelter of the apostle's energy, they were to work out their own salvation with fear and trembling.<a name=363:2></a> For, if Paul, who had so laboured for them, was now in prison, and could not, it was, after all "God (not Paul) who worked in them, to will and to do of his own good pleasure.<a name=363:3></a>"

		Salvation is always in the Philippians the great result of final deliverance from evil and entrance into glory.<a name=363:4></a> Everything is looked at the end, though the blessing shines down on the way.<a name=363:5></a> See then the result: "That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world, holding forth the word of life.<a name=363:6></a>" Is there a word in this that could not be said of Christ?<a name=363:7></a> Only He was the Model, and we are to follow His steps as partakers of life in Him.<a name=363:8></a> It is just what Christ was, and so it is Christian character.<a name=363:9></a> We study it with delight and adoration in Him.<a name=363:10></a> It is formed in us.<a name=363:11></a>

		Now see the gracious affections which flow out from this lowliness, in which self disappears by love.<a name=364:1></a> "Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy and rejoice with you all.<a name=364:2></a>" He makes the faith of the Philippians the principal thing.<a name=364:3></a> It was the offering to God.<a name=364:4></a> His part was only supplementary towards it, though it went to death.<a name=364:5></a> For the Philippians were Christ's, the fruit of the travail of Christ's soul, Christ's crown and joy as Redeemer.<a name=364:6></a> So the apostle saw them and rejoiced in them.<a name=364:7></a> His service had ministered to this.<a name=364:8></a> If it went on to give up his life for it, he rejoiced in the service, so much the more evidently self-sacrificing love, for love delights in this.<a name=364:9></a> And they, for this reason, were to rejoice with him, for it was really his glory thus to give himself up for Christ.<a name=364:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But more.<a name=364:11></a> He was thinking of their happiness, and would send Timotheus and learn how they were getting on.<a name=364:12></a> But he counted on their love, and he would not send him till he would be able to say to them how his affairs were going on at Rome, where he had to appear before the emperor, perhaps so to close his life.<a name=364:13></a> All this is very sweet.<a name=364:14></a> There is the confidence of love, the reckoning on it in others, which produces its free flow, mutually felt and known to be so.<a name=364:15></a> Nor was it in the apostle alone, as we shall see.<a name=364:16></a> Moreover, it was in the midst of the coldness of the saints, which trial (and for the flesh the discrediting opposition of the world) had produced, to which the apostle alludes in this epistle.<a name=364:17></a> But the apostle's love did not grow cold nor distrustful by it, and God had given him the comforting testimony of love in the distant Philippians, as he notices in the beginning of the chapter; and love was springing up into courage in others too by a little patience, as we see in chapter 1: 14.<a name=364:18></a>

		But these same fruits of love are found in Epaphroditus and his relations with the Philippians.<a name=364:19></a> Paul sends him back with affectionate witness of what he was; for Epaphroditus was longing after them all.<a name=364:20></a> He had undertaken his commission heartily -- came probably along the great Egnation high road nearly a thousand miles, and, in his refusal of relaxation, had been sick, nigh unto death.<a name=364:21></a> But it was the work of Christ.<a name=364:22></a> Did Paul appreciate it the less as to himself because it was for Christ?<a name=364:23></a> In no way.<a name=364:24></a> Had Epaphroditus fallen a victim to his service for him, it would have been to the apostle a deep blow and sorrow, and that he had his cup full of, though sustained of God.<a name=364:25></a> God had mercy on Epaphroditus, and on Paul in him.<a name=364:26></a> See here how the heart, free in grace, can estimate present mercies!<a name=364:27></a> It was not natural affection in relationship, just and fitting as that may be in its place, but divine affections.<a name=364:28></a> Epaphroditus would have gone to heaven surely.<a name=364:29></a> But the spirit of the apostle would taste present goodness -- God's goodness in circumstances; it would know a "God who comforts those that are cast down.<a name=364:30></a>" And he blesses God that the beloved Epaphroditus did not fall a sacrifice to his zeal in accomplishing his mission.<a name=364:31></a><a name=365>[Page 365]</a>

		If we look at ourselves, we could never speak of humbling ourselves: for we are nothing.<a name=365:11></a> But practically in Christ, the mind which was in Him is to be in us, and in grace we have to humble ourselves, to have the mind that was in Him, to have done with ourselves and serve.<a name=365:12></a> Then these lovely fruits of grace will flow out unhindered, whatever be the state even of Christendom around us.<a name=365:13></a> Working out lowlily our own salvation with fear and trembling in the midst of the spiritual dangers of the Christian life, and of pretensions to greatness and spiritual distinction, because true greatness has disappeared as it had when the apostle was put in prison; not with the fear of uncertainty, but because God works in us, and that gives the sense of the seriousness and reality of the conflict in which we are engaged; obedience, the humblest thing of all, for there is no will in it, characterising our path, we shall seek the mind of Christ, and be clothed with His character.<a name=365:14></a> Blessed privilege!<a name=365:15></a> Be more jealous to keep it than our human rights and importance, and the blessed graces of heavenly love will flow forth and bind together, in a love which has primarily Christ for its object, the hearts of the saints.<a name=365:16></a> In such a state it is easy to count others better than themselves; as Paul saw the value of the Philippians to Christ, he was but offered on their faith -- easy, because when we are near Christ we see the value of others to and in Christ, and we see our own nothingness, perhaps our actual short-comings in love too.<a name=365:17></a>

		PHILIPPIANS 3 AND 4
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I follow up a previous paper by sending you some remarks on Philippians 3, to which I will now add some on chapter 4, which has occupied my mind a little since.<a name=367:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Salvation in this epistle is looked at as before the Christian not as an uncertainty, but as a thing not yet attained.<a name=367:2></a> It is the actual possession of glory, the new estate of man in actual glory, in Christ ascended on high, which alone is in view.<a name=367:3></a> Christ has laid hold of the believer for it, but he is looking to lay hold on it.<a name=367:4></a> Christ, seen in that glory (and the apostle had so seen Him, in fact) is everything.<a name=367:5></a> Being thus found in Him is what Paul looks for, for righteousness, as all else, in that day.<a name=367:6></a> When he gets actually before God, laying aside everything Jewish that might exalt him, everything human, his only thought is to be found in Christ.<a name=367:7></a> This puts the new estate of man in a very striking position.<a name=367:8></a> The whole Christian estate is looked at as future, because in resurrection, its being actually attained being the whole matter in hand.<a name=367:9></a> Hence justification, righteousness itself, is seen as actual acceptance in Christ, when we arrive before God.<a name=367:10></a> We come before God in Christ.<a name=367:11></a> The apostle unequivocally looks for a resurrection -- state and glory.<a name=367:12></a> Till he has that, he has never attained, is not yet perfect.<a name=367:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The present state of man, even supposing he has been quickened of God, is his state as born of the first Adam; not simply because of sin, for the apostle supposes here the Christian to be walking above it, always walking in the Spirit, making progress towards glory, but in no way occupied with sin.<a name=367:14></a> But he sees the Christian needing to be brought into this new state identified with Christ in glory.<a name=367:15></a> If he had the whole righteousness which the flesh or the first Adam was capable of, and of which the law was the rule, this was only the first man, not the Second: he would not have it.<a name=367:16></a> It was not Christ, God's righteousness by faith.<a name=367:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He had seen Christ, the second Man, the last Adam, accepted in glory.<a name=367:18></a> He has been laid hold of to be conformed to this, this wholly new state and condition of man according to God's righteousness.<a name=367:19></a> It had displaced all else in his mind.<a name=367:20></a> He could not be content with anything else or less.<a name=367:21></a> The two were incompatible; and he could not have the old man's place, even if it were righteous, and the new man's too.<a name=367:22></a> He counts all these things which honoured and accredited the first man, the self, Paul, as loss and dung.<a name=367:23></a> The risen glorified Man is before us.<a name=367:24></a> It is not however here considered as that which has justified us; that inasmuch as we have died with Christ, who made atonement for us, and that we are risen with Him according to the value of that work in virtue of which as of His person He is risen, we are justified, and our acceptance witnessed before God.<a name=367:25></a> It is not with this view of judicial acceptance the resurrection is viewed here; but as a new state, into which in its full result, we are to enter, including of course divine righteousness, but the whole new state of glory.<a name=367:26></a> This puts the new estate into which Christianity brings us in a very strong light.<a name=367:27></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The old man, the whole old estate is done with in the apostle's mind, righteousness and all; and his mind is Fixed on the new, that is, on Christ Himself; but this as involving his own place in glory, in having part hereafter, in "the resurrection from among the dead," as Christ was: "That I may win Christ.<a name=368:1></a>" "If by any means I may attain to the resurrection from among the dead"; it is "<i>from among</i>" them.<a name=368:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This leads us directly to the great principle of the chapter the earnest undistracted following after this glory, after Christ Himself, and heeding nothing else, counting all as worthless for its attainment.<a name=368:3></a> The former chapter, we have seen, presented Christ in His humiliation, leading the heart to the like manifestation of graciousness in our path and ways with others here below.<a name=368:4></a> This gives that energy of spiritual pursuit, from the second glorified Man being set before our eyes, which sets us above the world and every motive in it, and everything which added importance to the old self, so as to give its just and heart-enlarging object to the new man; and it makes us heavenly-minded, and withal undistracted in our Christian course.<a name=368:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is one of the beauties of Christianity, that it gives, through our perfect reconciliation in Christ, the pure peacefulness of affections perfectly happy in an existing relationship, and with it the highest object of hope, which urges to unceasing activity.<a name=368:6></a> These are the two forming elements of human nature for good; both in the highest and a divine way are found in Christ.<a name=368:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=369>[Page 369]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But to pursue our chapter, which takes up the latter of these principles.<a name=369:1></a> We have the fullest element of satisfying glory for ourselves, the prize of our calling above, the resurrection from among the dead; yet all selfishness is taken out of it.<a name=369:2></a> What clothed self with honour is, as we have seen, all loss.<a name=369:3></a> It helped to set up the old man.<a name=369:4></a> The Christian's object is Christ, which implies getting rid of the first altogether.<a name=369:5></a> It exalts man but not self.<a name=369:6></a> When modern infidelity would exalt man, it simply exalts self.<a name=369:7></a> Christianity exalts man, even to divine glory and divine excellency, but it sets aside self wholly.<a name=369:8></a> "What was gain to me," says the apostle, "I counted loss for Christ.<a name=369:9></a>" Learning is gain for self -- to be English, French, etc.<a name=369:10></a>: to have mine own righteousness as a reputation in the world, or a title with God, is self.<a name=369:11></a> I am what others are not.<a name=369:12></a> The world wants these motives -- of course it does; it has no other.<a name=369:13></a> Energy is produced by them, but there is no moral advance.<a name=369:14></a> Self remains the spring, the centre, of human activity.<a name=369:15></a> We are told:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<blockquote>"Self-love but serves the virtuous mind to wake, <br>As the small pebble stirs the peaceful lake.<a name=369:16></a>" </blockquote>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A larger circle may be produced round self, but self remains the centre still.<a name=369:17></a> "Master, that thou shouldest give us to sit one on thy right hand and another on thy left hand, in thy kingdom.<a name=369:18></a>" This was self -- a good place which others would not have.<a name=369:19></a> None of this is found here.<a name=369:20></a> "That I may win Christ" is the highest blessing, the blessedest affections, but all transferring the heart from self to Christ.<a name=369:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But see further.<a name=369:22></a> It transferred the affections to what in itself was supremely excellent, to an object which was the adequate object of the delight to God the Father.<a name=369:23></a> God has given to us to delight in what He finds His sufficient object of delight in too.<a name=369:24></a> What a tale this tells of our true reconciliation to God!<a name=369:25></a> Not merely judicial reconciliation to God, which was needed, but the elevation of our moral nature to the measure of divine delights and fellowship with Him; though of course, ever recipient, and glad to be so from love, He ever the divine Giver; but in Christ the one Object of delight.<a name=369:26></a> In the creature, though there may be a suited nature, as evidently there must, yet the moral state of the soul is formed and characterised by its objects.<a name=369:27></a> Here we are made partakers of the divine nature and have divine objects.<a name=369:28></a> But this is not now in rest.<a name=369:29></a> That will be our heavenly state.<a name=369:30></a> We are living in the midst of a world by which Satan seeks to seduce us by acting on the old man.<a name=369:31></a>

		<a name=370>[Page 370]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		While there is thankfulness and courage because Christ has laid hold on us, yet Christ before us in hope leads out the affections in energy; and, while it has begun by delivering us from selfish recurrence to our own importance, leads us now in superiority to worldly objects by the absorbing attraction of Christ.<a name=370:1></a> We are kept humble by the consciousness that we have not attained, energetic in sanctified affections because we have Christ to attain, delivered from the world by the absorbing power of a divine object acting on the new man, This gives singleness of purpose, and thus undistracted power, while the judgment is formed solely on the way things bear on Christ.<a name=370:2></a> Everything is thus estimated in the highest way by a perfect criterion, and that in the affections, though indeed in moral things true judgment cannot exist without this.<a name=370:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Further, though it be in no way the chief or highest element, there is, when the world does come before us, the power of contrast.<a name=370:4></a> For all this surely the action of the Holy Ghost is needed; but I speak of the way it operates, not of its gracious source.<a name=370:5></a> This gives, moreover, superiority to difficulties.<a name=370:6></a> This is the force of "by any means" -- not a doubt, but what ever it may cost, whatever road I may have to take, so as I attain, I am content; yea, I can rejoice in suffering and death -- I shall be so much the more like the Christ I am desirous of attaining.<a name=370:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Note here, he seeks the power of resurrection first; that, knowing the divine energy of this new life, which takes him in spirit out of the present one, the sufferings or death of the first, as the fruit of devotedness to Christ, were only conformity to Him.<a name=370:8></a> And thus, even if it were by such means as death itself, he should attain to the glory of the new state into which Christ had risen.<a name=370:9></a> (Not new indeed to Him personally, but to man, to the human nature, which in grace He had taken and carried back with Him into glory.<a name=370:10></a>) This gave its full character to his walk as to its daily energy.<a name=370:11></a> Having this state of resurrection from among the dead in view, he never could count himself to have attained in this life, nor to be perfect; for, for him to be perfect was to be like Christ in glory.<a name=370:12></a> He followed after that he might attain and apprehend that (lay hold upon and possess it) for which Christ had apprehended him.<a name=370:13></a> Two things ensued; he followed nothing else -- had no other object.<a name=370:14></a>

		But this was not all.<a name=371:1></a> He did follow this earnestly and undividedly.<a name=371:2></a> It was not merely that he disapproved of certain things and was inert, but the absorbing power of One had delivered him from all else.<a name=371:3></a> But this, while it took his heart off the others, fixed it on this.<a name=371:4></a> But this object on which his mind was fixed was always before him, not attained, every day brighter to his spirit, but not possessed.<a name=371:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This kept him looking straight forward, and never occupied with the ground he had passed over.<a name=371:6></a> He forgot the things which were behind, and reached forward to those things which were before, pressing towards those things which were before.<a name=371:7></a> The man who would stop to contemplate the ground gone over in a race would not get on in it, would soon be passed in it.<a name=371:8></a> Self would come in; the manna would breed worms; the heart be off its object.<a name=371:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This gives another marked effect of this energy of the single eye.<a name=371:10></a> It looks exclusively at what is heavenly.<a name=371:11></a> Its calling is on high, its hopes and thoughts fixed on that; not looking, says the apostle, on what is seen, but on what is not seen.<a name=371:12></a> This gives a heavenly temperament and habit to the whole man.<a name=371:13></a> His conversation is in heaven; his relationships of life are all up there.<a name=371:14></a> There is thankfulness and elevation in this.<a name=371:15></a> It is God's calling, His calling us <i>above</i> and in Christ Jesus.<a name=371:16></a> The heart is intelligent as to its source and way.<a name=371:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not dwell on what the apostle puts in contrast.<a name=371:18></a> Minding earthly things, men are fixed on what can cause no progress, on what takes them off what is heavenly, what is pure and divine.<a name=371:19></a> But it goes further; they are enemies of the cross.<a name=371:20></a> The cross was death to this world.<a name=371:21></a> It marked the place of what was divine and heavenly in this world.<a name=371:22></a> The saint glories in dying to the world.<a name=371:23></a> He who lives in it, in spirit, is the enemy of that.<a name=371:24></a> The end is destruction.<a name=371:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One thing remains, to carry out this hope of the Christian to completion -- Christ's coming.<a name=371:26></a> We have these hopes, "this treasure in earthen vessels.<a name=371:27></a>" Christ shall come and change the body of our humiliation and fashion it like to His glorious body.<a name=371:28></a> Then what we have had in hope, in desire forming our souls after it, will be actually accomplished in glory.<a name=371:29></a> We shall be like Christ and with Him.<a name=371:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such is the character of energy which delivers from and gives the victory over all that is in the world, setting our affections on things above, not on things on the earth, making Christ Himself, as He is on high, the bright and blessed object of our souls.<a name=371:31></a> Chapter 4, as this has run to some length, I reserve for another paper.<a name=371:32></a>

		ON THE PHILIPPIANS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Epistle to the Philippians looks at the Christian as on a journey with an object before him, and that object the actual winning of Christ, the laying hold of that for which he had been laid hold of by Christ; and therefore salvation is looked at as a thing to be attained -- the Christian reaching in result what he had laid hold on before by faith.<a name=373:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 1 is an introduction.<a name=373:2></a> Chapters 2, 3, 4, present to us three aspects of Christian life.<a name=373:3></a> In chapter 2 we see the gracious mind that was in Christ illustrated in the servants and the saints also: in chapter 3 the energy of the apostle in running after the prize: and in chapter 4 his complete superiority over all circumstances.<a name=373:4></a> In all of it the experience which is the result of the power of the Spirit of God acting in the Christian -- no idea of failure.<a name=373:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We do not get sin mentioned throughout the epistle.<a name=373:6></a> There were a few things that needed setting right: for instance, the two women in chapter 4 needed exhorting to be of the same mind, they were in a little discord; but what is described is the effect of the Spirit's power.<a name=373:7></a> Sin is not mentioned.<a name=373:8></a> Nevertheless I suppose the Thessalonian saints were in the freshest condition of any we read of, as we find the first epistle was written to them only about two months or the like after their conversion, so that their first love was in activity.<a name=373:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There was real devotedness in the gospel amongst the Philippians, which the apostle does not omit noticing, nor forget their kindness now renewed.<a name=373:10></a> (See chapter 4: 15, 16, and 1: 3, 7, where read "ye have me," not "I have you.<a name=373:11></a>") And this gave him confidence as to them, as well as regarded himself, that He who had begun the good work would accomplish it unto the day of Christ.<a name=373:12></a> There the work is still viewed as one reaching on to its great result.<a name=373:13></a> As to himself this confidence was most blessed, and accompanied by, and in some respects the fruit of, a conscience kept in the full light of God's countenance by the Spirit of God.<a name=373:14></a> "As always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body.<a name=373:15></a>" Self is always shut out when grace is really known and enjoyed.<a name=373:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then a word as to verse 6.<a name=373:17></a> It is a great comfort to know that what God has begun He is going to complete; and it was Paul's confidence towards the Philippian saints, because they had him in their heart, as verse 7 tells us.<a name=373:18></a> This made it but just for him to judge the divine life was working in them; but then there was this deep comfort for the love that was in his heart, and freshly awakened in it; but then that was God's work and He would complete it.<a name=373:19></a> This verse should be read according to the margin, and not as translated in the text.<a name=373:20></a> The apostle was in their hearts, and it was a proof to him of divine life.<a name=373:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=374>[Page 374]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul was not occupied at all with his outward life, but with the inward life.<a name=374:1></a> He had Christ always before him, and when it was a question of which he would choose, whether to go to be with Christ or to remain on the earth, he is in a strait; if he dies, it is to be with Christ; and if he remains, it is worth while, for here he can labour for the church's good: and through the blessedness of both paths he knows not which to choose, so that self is done away as a motive.<a name=374:2></a> Blessed state!<a name=374:3></a> And then the blessing of the saints is his motive under Christ, and so he remains as more needful for them.<a name=374:4></a> You see it is Christ that decides thus the result, and he decides his own case; for if it be better for the church he should remain, Christ was over all -- he would remain.<a name=374:5></a> It is not the reckless Nero nor any one else; it is a question with Paul what most pleases Christ.<a name=374:6></a> He never thinks of the circumstances which he was in: nigh unto death, he has got his eye only on Christ.<a name=374:7></a> To die would be gain to any Christian, and so would to live be Christ.<a name=374:8></a> But there is a difference between an abstract truth and the practical realisation of that truth; like Paul, in the Acts, when before Agrippa, he could say, "I would that .<a name=374:9></a>.<a name=374:10></a>.<a name=374:11></a> all that hear me this day were .<a name=374:12></a>.<a name=374:13></a>.<a name=374:14></a> altogether such I am, except these bonds.<a name=374:15></a>" We know any Christian could say that, for it would be better that all were saved; but it is a very different thing to be in Paul's condition, and say it with his spirit.<a name=374:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In verse 10, where the expression "the day of Christ" occurs, it means the day when He comes to judge; it is always so when it refers to our responsibility; it never means the rapture of the church when it speaks of saints' responsibility, as in 1 Timothy 6: 13, 14, "I give thee charge .<a name=374:17></a>.<a name=374:18></a>.<a name=374:19></a> that thou keep this commandment without spot until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=374:20></a>" We could not connect the rapture with responsibility.<a name=374:21></a> We are all alike caught up together, and alike conformed to the image of God's Son.<a name=374:22></a> It is the result of grace for every saint; but the rewards will be according to the fruits and works, as in John 15, "Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit.<a name=374:23></a>" And the Christian is not merely called on to avoid open evil, but to have spiritual discernment, so as to understand what is excellent -- more conformed to the divine mind.<a name=374:24></a> This makes verse 10 of chapter 1 a very important one.<a name=374:25></a> Verse 12 brings out the power over circumstances.<a name=374:26></a> It did not matter what position Paul was in he always reckoned on the power of Christ.<a name=374:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=375>[Page 375]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is beautiful to see how Christ is the sole object before the apostle.<a name=375:1></a> He is glad though it be in contention that Christ is preached, so that He was preached.<a name=375:2></a> "I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.<a name=375:3></a>" A person who is converted may walk in a manner that does not dishonour Christ, but it is a different thing to have Christ as the motive for everything; and if the latter condition be that of the soul, it always raises the mind above sorrow.<a name=375:4></a> For the thought that Christ was preached of contention might cause sorrow in the apostle's heart, but he is above that because Christ is preached.<a name=375:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Where there is not real spiritual energy, the thought of prison cows people; and when Satan managed to get the preacher of Christ there, he thought he had gained his end; but they got courage as to his bonds.<a name=375:6></a> Paul was so identified with the gospel that, when the gospel succeeded, it was to him success; and in that day the gospel was not made to suit people as in this day.<a name=375:7></a> Paul was nothing terrified by his adversaries; as Peter also says, "As long as ye do well and are not afraid with any amazement.<a name=375:8></a>" Satan tried to alarm people and make them shy.<a name=375:9></a> When the apostle speaks of the gospel or the vocation, as in chapter 1: 27, he means the whole thing (Christianity).<a name=375:10></a> The word "conversation" in this verse refers to one's walk.<a name=375:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"To them an evident token of perdition.<a name=375:12></a>" For when Satan's power is fully exercised, and it is seen that it has no power over Paul or any servant of Christ, it is manifested that it has met One which is superior to itself, that is, a divine One, and that they who oppose are its adversaries; and thus it is a token of perdition to them, and for the same reason, of salvation to those helped by divine power; for still salvation in the epistle is the result in victory.<a name=375:13></a> Then in verse 29 we see that "it is given not only to believe, but to suffer for his sake.<a name=375:14></a>" And now we come to the end of chapter 1, which is a kind of introduction to the epistle.<a name=375:15></a>

		Chapter 2 is full of instruction.<a name=375:16></a> It is very touching the way the apostle speaks in this chapter.<a name=375:17></a> They had sent him help from a long way, and sought to minister to his wants; but he says, if they want to make him truly happy -- to fulfil his joy, they must be walking like Christ; they must be of one mind.<a name=375:18></a> How gently and courteous a way of dealing with them is this, in the presence of their love and kindness to him!<a name=375:19></a> He could not harshly reprove, but love would not have the evil uncorrected, and deals thus delicately as to it.<a name=375:20></a> "If there be any consolation in Christ," etc.<a name=375:21></a>, "fulfil ye my joy, that ye be like-minded.<a name=375:22></a>" He sets Christ before them as an example; and he could say too, "Be ye followers of me, as I also am of Christ," not "as far as I follow Christ"; but I am following Christ, and I want you to copy my example and follow Him too.<a name=375:23></a>

		Then in verses 3, 4, of this chapter, each is exhorted to "esteem each other better than himself.<a name=376:1></a>" Now there will be no difficulty in this if we are really walking before God; we shall be occupied with each other's good, and the one will esteem the other better than himself, because when the soul is really before the Lord, it will see its own shortcomings and imperfections, and will be in self-judgment; and according to the love and spirit of Christ see all the good that is from Him in a brother and one dear to him, and will therefore look upon his fellow-Christian as better than himself, and so all would be in beautiful harmony; and we should be looking after each other's interests too.<a name=376:2></a> As I have often remarked, love likes to be a servant, and selfishness likes to be served.<a name=376:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, in verses 5-8, we get the humiliation of Jesus even unto death, though not in the sense of atonement, nor of patience of suffering put upon Him, but in voluntary humiliation, the way and pattern of lowliness for our souls, producing the graciousness which becomes the Christian and adorns his life.<a name=376:4></a> This is in contrast with the first Adam.<a name=376:5></a> He sought to be exalted when in the form of man, and that by robbery; he ate that which was forbidden, to become equal with God; but the last Adam, when in the form of God (though He thought it not robbery to be equal with God as to His dignity) left all and came down here to be a man, and in the form of a servant; and then as a man humbled Himself, and became obedient to death.<a name=376:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		God looks for us to walk in the character of the last Adam, and not of the first -- that of humbling and not of exalting.<a name=376:7></a> "Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ.<a name=376:8></a>" Thus a self-humbling Christ, the mind that was in Him, is the source of Christian graciousness and consideration for others; and this will be found exemplified in Paul's way of dealing with them, and all that follows as to Timothy and Epaphroditus, where Christian love is so sweetly insisted on as well as shewn.<a name=376:9></a>

		In chapter 3, on the other hand, Paul sees Christ up in the glory, and is running after Him, giving its energy to the Christian life, as in chapter 2 he sees Him on the earth as the brightest example of lowliness; and as the result of that lowliness God gives Him a name which is above every name: this is given to Him as Son of man.<a name=377:1></a> The mind that was in Christ was the mind of coming down, and that is what the apostle wants to see in us.<a name=377:2></a>

		The word "Lord" is used in two distinct senses in the New Testament; in some places it means "Jehovah," and in others made "Lord and Christ," as Lord over all; as in Acts 10.<a name=377:7></a> He is "Lord of all.<a name=377:8></a>" This is the sense in which it is used in chapter 2: 11.<a name=377:9></a> Of course, we know that He is Jehovah, as in John 12, where the quotation is made from Isaiah 6, "I saw the Lord," etc.<a name=377:10></a> There you get Him as Jehovah, and often in the Old Testament.<a name=377:11></a> In truth the second Person of the Godhead is He in whom Jehovah is revealed there.<a name=377:12></a> We may see how the three persons are closely connected all through the acts of Christ, even in the miracles -- Christ as Son wrought the miracles; but it is said, "The Father that is in me, he doeth the works.<a name=377:13></a>" And also, "If I cast out demons by the Spirit of God.<a name=377:14></a>" So we see the three inseparably united, as in the resurrection of Christ also.<a name=377:15></a> We find in chapter 2 of John's gospel Christ speaking of raising Himself.<a name=377:16></a> "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it again.<a name=377:17></a>" Then we read in another scripture, "Whom God raised from the dead"; and lastly, He was "quickened by the Spirit.<a name=377:18></a>" All God's glory was engaged in the resurrection of Christ.<a name=377:19></a>

		In the epistles of John you cannot separate Christ and God.<a name=377:20></a> The apostle speaks of Christ both as God and Christ in the very same sentence, as in 1 John 2: 20; chapter 3: 1: "Abide in him; that when he shall appear" .<a name=377:21></a>.<a name=377:22></a>.<a name=377:23></a> at his coming that is Christ, born of Him.<a name=377:24></a> In verse 29 the same person is God, as is manifest from chapter 3: 1; "him not" is Christ; "he shall appear," now it is Christ again, and so all verses 2, 3.<a name=377:25></a> Thus he calls Him God and Christ in the same verse, and there are other similar instances in this epistle.<a name=377:26></a> We see this divine union in the words of Christ Himself, for He says in John's Gospel, "The Son of man, who is in heaven," although He was then actually on earth at the time.<a name=377:27></a> The word "Jehovah" refers to the three persons of the Gospel, which men rightly call the Trinity.<a name=377:28></a>

		I would just notice the way in which people have blundered with reference to the twelfth verse, which they think conveys the idea of a person working himself to obtain eternal life in contrast with God's working, insisting on the words "work out your own.<a name=378:9></a>" It is altogether mistaken.<a name=378:10></a> The apostle had been with them and had cared for them, had worked for them, kept at bay the power of the enemy, meeting the difficulties of the warfare.<a name=378:11></a> But this was not to continue; he now being in prison and having left them, they had to work out their salvation.<a name=378:12></a> That is, they would now have to fight their own battles, and have their own conflicts, which Paul felt was a very solemn thing; they were to do it "with fear and trembling.<a name=378:13></a>" And I am sure we shall all feel it a solemn thing, if we have a right apprehension of it, when we think of the great powers that are against us -- the world, the flesh, and Satan; and are having to make good God's cause and maintain by grace our own standing (learning too the conflict of flesh and Spirit).<a name=378:14></a>

		It is indeed a solemn thing to know that we are the vessels of a conflict between God and Satan.<a name=379:1></a> But it is no contrast between our working and God's; but our working and Paul's, who could no longer be in the conflict for them, but who adds, "it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do" -- they had not lost Him.<a name=379:2></a> When Scripture speaks of my place in Christ as the result of accomplished redemption, there are no "ifs" or "buts" or warnings about it.<a name=379:3></a> These come when it looks at me as a Christian in the world under responsibility.<a name=379:4></a> And the Lord brings us through our trials and difficulties; but it is only to shew us what is in ourselves and also to display what is in God, to abound over it all.<a name=379:5></a> So we see the passage of the children of Israel from the Red Sea to Canaan taught them many difficulties, but it also taught them the faithfulness of God: and when the journey through the wilderness was really finished, and they were come to the borders of the land, and were called to go up the mountain and enter into the land, their unbelief and distrust broke out, and they wanted Moses to send spies to see the land before they attempted to enter.<a name=379:6></a> Well, God permitted it, but what was the result?<a name=379:7></a> The very appearance of the place frightened them; the high walls, etc.<a name=379:8></a>, staggered them; and they were afraid to go up.<a name=379:9></a> So Moses says, Well, there is nothing but the wilderness for you; and so they turned back.<a name=379:10></a> But, though chastening, God turned back with them.<a name=379:11></a>

		Surely it only brings out God's purpose of grace, as Moses told them in Deuteronomy 8, it was to "humble thee and prove thee, to know what was in thine heart," and also to shew them what was in His.<a name=379:12></a> And He was above all their failure and shortcomings, taking care of them even to the nap of their coats.<a name=379:13></a> His ultimate result was blessing.<a name=379:14></a> "In all their afflictions he was afflicted.<a name=379:15></a>" I am sure it is a real conflict; but then we have the joy that God works in us.<a name=379:16></a> A man who has been a very proud one, when he is really broken-hearted before God, makes a humbler Christian than a man who never shewed signs of pride at all; for he finds grace with God to be subdued, and manifests that grace with others; when he sees it rising, he knows what is rising, and therefore is ready with a check upon it.<a name=379:17></a>

		CHAPTER 1

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Epistle to the Philippians has a peculiar character rather distinct from the other epistles; though there are indeed traces of the same in the Epistle to Timothy.<a name=383:1></a> Taking it characteristically, it is the epistle of Christian experience.<a name=383:2></a>

		We do not get doctrinal teaching in it, but the experience of Christian walk -- not the experience of one who is going wrong, but of one who is going right, the experience which the Spirit of God gives.<a name=383:3></a> The apostle is perfectly clear as to his position, yet here he counts himself not to have attained anything.<a name=383:4></a> He is on the road, he has not got there; but Christ has laid hold on him.<a name=383:5></a> When I speak of my place in Christ, as in Ephesians, it is in heavenly places; but, as a matter of fact, we are here going on through the earth full of temptations and snares.<a name=383:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Philippians gives us -- not of course failure -- but the path of the Christian, salvation being looked at throughout as at the end of the wilderness.<a name=383:7></a> Paul had no doubt that Christ had laid hold on him for this blessedness, but he had not got there.<a name=383:8></a> Salvation is always looked at as the close of the journey in Philippians.<a name=383:9></a>

		It is so much the more remarkable as to the Christian's path that you never find sin mentioned from the beginning to the end of the epistle.<a name=383:10></a> The thorn in the flesh was needed when Paul came down from Paradise; it was not that the flesh had become any better.<a name=383:11></a> The thorn was something to hinder sin, something that made him outwardly contemptible in his ministry.<a name=383:12></a> Every one, probably, would have a different thorn according to his need.<a name=383:13></a> There is no change in the flesh, but the power of the Spirit of God is such that the flesh is kept down.<a name=383:14></a> "Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus" would not be necessary if the flesh were any better.<a name=383:15></a> It is not that there is any uncertainty as to salvation or acceptance, but that we should so walk through the wilderness that the flesh should be shut up, as it were.<a name=383:16></a> Suppose I have a troublesome man in the house, if I keep him locked up, I am quite easy about him; but sometimes we are foolish enough to leave the door open.<a name=383:17></a> God looks at us as dead with Christ, and we are called on to reckon ourselves dead.<a name=383:18></a> I have a title to do it because Christ has died, and I am crucified with Christ.<a name=383:19></a> It is not only that we are born of God, but we have died with Christ,

		There is no mending of the flesh, no sanctification of nature, no forming of man as he is; there is death to it.<a name=395:10></a> The old man has been entirely and finally judged, but another is now in the glory as man.<a name=395:11></a> This we could not have as an object of faith until Christ was risen.<a name=395:12></a> God has "provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect" -- "perfect," that is, in glory.<a name=395:13></a> That could not be, nor was there any title for it, till the work upon the cross; therein is the title and groundwork for all this.<a name=395:14></a> There was no connection with Christ as man among the children of Adam; He was a true man, but union there was none whatever.<a name=395:15></a> He was one of them, but He was alone.<a name=395:16></a> He was a man without sin; we were men with sin: you can never unite the two, for they "are contrary the one to the other.<a name=395:17></a>" He could come in grace as a true man amongst us, but He abode alone.<a name=395:18></a>

		If we are conscious of weakness and are leaning only on grace, we need not offend: there is power for us.<a name=401:14></a> It is possible that at a given moment I may not have power; but this is because I have been going wrong previously.<a name=401:15></a> Christ was witnessing while Peter was denying; but Christ had been praying while Peter had been sleeping.<a name=401:16></a> The armour should be put on before the battle, not just at the battle.<a name=401:17></a> When Satan came to Him with his wiles, the Lord had only to rest quietly in obedience: there was no longer reasoning, no confusion about it.<a name=401:18></a> Satan says, "Command that these stones be made bread"; the Lord answers He is come to obey.<a name=401:19></a> For it is written that "man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.<a name=401:20></a>" Then Satan tells Him to cast Himself down (that is, not to trust God), but is told, "It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.<a name=401:21></a>" These are wiles; but when Satan comes openly, then resist Satan.<a name=401:22></a> "Get thee hence, Satan"; then he flees.<a name=401:23></a> We have not to overcome him who is overcome; but we have to overcome his wiles by the word in obedience.<a name=401:24></a>

		The only effect of trying circumstances is to give much deeper acquaintance with the Lord's faithfulness, and withal much deeper joy.<a name=402:1></a> At the end of four years in prison Paul could say, "Rejoice in the Lord always"; he had nothing else to rejoice in.<a name=402:2></a> He says, as it were, The more I know of every trial and hindrance in my work as an apostle, the more I can tell you, You can rejoice in the Lord always.<a name=402:3></a> It is a beautiful thing to see Paul the person to say, You must be always rejoicing.<a name=402:4></a> The thing that hinders our rejoicing is not trouble, but being half-and-half.<a name=402:5></a> If in the world, his conscience reproaches the Christian; if he meets spiritual Christians, he is uncomfortable there; in fact he is happy nowhere.<a name=402:6></a> A man's affections do not hinder his work for his children.<a name=402:7></a> If we were serving Christ simply, we should go back to Him all the happier when the service was done.<a name=402:8></a>

		There is more: "But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again, wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity.<a name=404:24></a>" Observe the delicacy of the apostle here; "I am glad that at the last" this proves that he had been in trouble, in want -- I do not mean you were forgetting me, but ye lacked opportunity.<a name=404:25></a> I have learned in whatsoever state I am to be content; this is the effect of trusting Christ in it all.<a name=404:26></a> "I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound.<a name=404:27></a>" He was in abundance sometimes; and this is much more dangerous: we are apt to rest in the gift instead of looking at the giver; but with Paul it brought out only thankfulness.<a name=404:28></a>

		I think it is beautiful how the apostle does not take himself out of a man.<a name=405:22></a> Superiority is to go through circumstances and feel them all, and yet to be above them.<a name=405:23></a> Look how he speaks of Epaphroditus in Philippians 2.<a name=405:24></a> As a doctrine, if he had died, he would have gone to heaven; but it was not that.<a name=405:25></a> He felt it as it was, it was not a hard mind that cast off the trial.<a name=405:26></a> When the Lord saw the widow, "He was moved with compassion.<a name=405:27></a>" There was no insensibility in Him, but in going through the circumstances He was sensible of them, yet above them.<a name=405:28></a> The way we should walk is as never governed by circumstances, not in insensibility, but in superiority.<a name=405:29></a> Christ is the answer to it: cast your care on Him.<a name=405:30></a>
