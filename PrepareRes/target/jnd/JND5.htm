		NOTES ON THE APOCALYPSE GLEANED AT LECTURES IN 1842¦
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<h3>CHAPTER 1</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first eight verses serve as an introduction to the whole book.<a name=1:1></a> It is profitable, and throws light on the Apocalypse itself, to examine the peculiar character of the book, and the manner in which Jesus reveals Himself in it.<a name=1:2></a> There is a special blessing attached to the reading of this book (chapter 1:3; 22:7).<a name=1:3></a> It is a practical thing.<a name=1:4></a> "Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein.<a name=1:5></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nothing is of more importance.<a name=1:6></a> The prophecies of the Old Testament strengthened the Jews in their relationship with God, and attached them to His government.<a name=1:7></a> Although God permits men to go their own way, led by their own passions, yet He never did, nor ever will, entirely give up the reins of government as to this world.<a name=1:8></a> This is what the Apocalypse shews us.<a name=1:9></a> All things work together for the glory of Jesus.<a name=1:10></a> We see in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:7">Hebrews  11:7</a> the effects of prophecy on faith.<a name=1:11></a> The faith of Abel recognises the sacrifice; Enoch walks with God.<a name=1:12></a> The faith of Noah condemns the world; it was not limited to the recognition of the efficacy of the sacrifice and walking with God; but Noah was warned of God of things not seen as yet, and, separated in walk from the world by this warning, became heir of the righteousness which is by faith, and condemned the world.<a name=1:13></a> The world put to death Jesus the heir.<a name=1:14></a> The church, warned of God of what is about to come to pass, knows that man in rebellion against God has no title to the inheritance of the world.<a name=1:15></a> The church in its suffering state does not possess it.<a name=1:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ is presented to us in the Apocalypse as the heir of the world.<a name=1:17></a> The church, like Noah, condemns the world, of which she is co-heir with Christ.<a name=1:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God is not presented as Father in the Apocalypse; this gives the character of the book.<a name=1:19></a> When the glory of the inheritance in the saints (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:17">Ephesians  1:17</a>,18) is treated of, Christ is presented as Man; and God, as the God of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=1:20></a> In <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:14">Ephesians  3:14</a>, where the communion of the

	<div class="paragraph">
		Father and of the Son is in question, He is presented as the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=2:1></a> In the Apocalypse, God is presented as the God who governs the world; whereas when it is the church that is in question, He is called Father.<a name=2:2></a> Moreover, in the Apocalypse, the subject is (not what relates to His connection with the church, but) the world, and its connection with God as Governor of the world.<a name=2:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 1 Christ is presented as <i>man</i>, but in <i>glory</i>.<a name=2:4></a> The communication is by an angel -- not by the Spirit of revelation and of communion, making the church to enjoy the glory and fellowship with the Father and with the Son.<a name=2:5></a> There is a great difference between what is communicated to the church and what has the church for its subject.<a name=2:6></a> When the church is addressed as to what concerns herself, she is addressed according to the presence of the Spirit which puts her in communion with the Father and the Son as the church, as the family.<a name=2:7></a> God communicated to Abraham what concerned Sodom, so to the church what concerns the world.<a name=2:8></a>

		Verse 1.<a name=2:9></a> A revelation is made to Jesus, and He communicates it to John by an angel.<a name=2:10></a><a href="#2:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> It is prophecy, the testimony of Jesus (i.<a name=2:11></a>e.<a name=2:12></a>, that which He gives Himself), and the word of God.<a name=2:13></a> The difference between the testimony of Jesus and the testimony to Jesus is of some importance in this book.<a name=2:14></a> It is often said that the Spirit of prophecy is the testimony of Jesus; so that those who should receive that alone, and have nothing more, have the testimony of Jesus, and the word of God.<a name=2:15></a> In this verse the learned agree to read, not the testimony of Jesus Christ, "<i>and of</i> all things that he saw," but "the testimony of Jesus Christ [viz.<a name=2:16></a>] all things that he saw"; that is to say, the visions in the Apocalypse themselves form the testimony.<a name=2:17></a> This prophecy is, first, the word of God; secondly, the testimony of Jesus Christ; thirdly, a vision -- "all things he <i>saw</i>.<a name=2:18></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 3.<a name=2:19></a> "For the time is at hand.<a name=2:20></a>" Those things are not fulfilled.<a name=2:21></a> The thought of the return of Jesus was so present that the disciples thought John would not die before <i>His</i> coming.<a name=2:22></a> John closed revelation.<a name=2:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Malachi closed the Old Testament by the promise of Elijah.<a name=2:24></a> From that time all is apocryphal.<a name=2:25></a> There is no new revelation or communications made that would constitute the proof of a recognised relationship.<a name=2:26></a> So the Apocalypse, which closes the

		God does not, in the interval, give up His people; but He makes no more revelations.<a name=3:2></a> Therefore He says "the time is at hand.<a name=3:3></a>" Thus the apostles speak of their time as being the last days.<a name=3:4></a> All the interval until the return of Jesus is the longsuffering of God towards the world.<a name=3:5></a> The church is to walk by faith, and by the revelation already given.<a name=3:6></a>

		Verse 4.<a name=3:7></a> John addresses directly the seven churches.<a name=3:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The salutation agrees with the character of the book.<a name=3:9></a> God presents Himself as the Eternal, as the One who reigns and rules.<a name=3:10></a> The Spirit is presented in a manner exterior to the relations of God with the church, as a spirit of wisdom and of light.<a name=3:11></a> It is the Spirit in His attributes of power and of perfection, the accomplisher of the divine will in the world.<a name=3:12></a> Moreover, Jesus is not presented here as the Head of the church in heaven, but as the faithful Witness, as risen, and as Prince of the kings of the earth.<a name=3:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 6.<a name=3:14></a> It is the church who receives the revelation and who answers, "Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, and made us to God and his Father kings and priests, to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever.<a name=3:15></a> Amen.<a name=3:16></a>" The church cannot forget the love of which she has been the object; and she expresses her own relation to God in the scene which is about to be disclosed.<a name=3:17></a> Jesus is placed last (verse 4,5) because He is one who communicates with the earth and whose of right it all is.<a name=3:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		God is on the throne, the Spirit is before the throne, and Jesus is in connection with the earth.<a name=3:19></a> This is the object of the book.<a name=3:20></a> It is not the church which is here in the thoughts of God; she receives the communication of them.<a name=3:21></a> Jesus has, in spite of Satan, title to the inheritance of the world; and He lets the church into the knowledge of His counsels before the thing takes place.<a name=3:22></a> God communicates to Abraham what He is going to do to Sodom; and here, to the church, what He is going to do to the world, in order that the church may

		<a class="footnote" name="#3:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>Nevertheless, although God the Father makes no more communication to the church, according to the relation of the Head of the body with the members of that body in its unity, yet He leaves here communications of the judgment He forms of the state of things which have the name of the church in the world, whatever its position or state may be. The seven churches are taken as a sample of the various states on which He bears this judgment, and thus of warning to all.

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 7.<a name=4:2></a> "Behold, he cometh with clouds.<a name=4:3></a>" This verse passes on to that which establishes His relation with the world the Jews included.<a name=4:4></a> That is the principal thought, the great subject of revelation here.<a name=4:5></a> The present dispensation is a dispensation of faith.<a name=4:6></a> The church has not seen Jesus risen; she has only seen the witnesses of His resurrection, and she must believe it on their testimony.<a name=4:7></a> "Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed," <a href="../bible/John.htm#20:29">John  20:29</a>.<a name=4:8></a> Such is the principle on which the believer walks in the present dispensation.<a name=4:9></a> "Every eye shall see him" (not those only who believe); that is the character of the coming dispensation.<a name=4:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 8.<a name=4:11></a> God introduces Himself, after the manifestation of Jesus to every eye, to close the testimony by the revelation of Himself -- the same that He had been in the beginning, and the Almighty God; which was, and is, and which is to come; unchanged through all the changes that had taken place.<a name=4:12></a> But the title of Alpha and Omega, and of the Eternal, which God takes here, is the same that is given to Jesus (chapter 21:6), where the prophecy is closed.<a name=4:13></a> He is always the image of the invisible God, always God Himself manifested in the flesh; the One who is, who was, and who is to come; the Almighty.<a name=4:14></a> Also, in comparing <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#6:14">1 Timothy  6:14</a>,16, with <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#19:16">Revelation  19:16</a>, we see the title of King of kings and Lord of lords, which, in the first of these passages, is applied to Him "who dwelleth in the light to which no one can approach," and who shall shew Jesus, applied to Jesus in the second; and when Jesus is "shewn," He comes with the same titles which He bears who shews Him.<a name=4:15></a> The name of Almighty is that by which God reveals Himself to Abraham; <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#6:3">Exodus  6:3</a>.<a name=4:16></a> At the end of the verse He reveals Himself as the one who will fulfil to the Jews the promises made to Abraham.<a name=4:17></a> The Almighty who had made these promises is the Eternal (that is to say Jehovah, the God of Israel.<a name=4:18></a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 9.<a name=4:19></a> It is well to notice the position of John which is connected with the character of the book.<a name=4:20></a> He does not exactly present himself as a member of the body, though he is so, of course; but in his actual position, viz.<a name=4:21></a>, where the delay of the coming of the Master places the faithful, that is, in tribulation.<a name=4:22></a> His actual position was like that of others in the tribulation of Christ as member of His kingdom, and like Him awaiting the moment when the accomplishment of the promises of the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		glory should take place -- "in the tribulation, the kingdom, and the patience of Christ.<a name=5:1></a>" Such is the position of the church, which becomes her while the king is hidden in God; <a href="../bible/John.htm#21:22">John  21:22</a>.<a name=5:2></a> The word of God and the testimony of Jesus had placed him there, and the testimony of Jesus was peculiarly that of the kingdom.<a name=5:3></a> Again, observe here that the Lord's day is Sunday.<a name=5:4></a> The meaning is not the day of the Lord.<a name=5:5></a> Nor is there any doubt that the greater part of the visions apply to what precedes that coming day.<a name=5:6></a> The rest of the chapter shews us already the glory of Christ.<a name=5:7></a> Affection is inseparable from testimony to the glory of Jesus.<a name=5:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verses 12,13.<a name=5:9></a> When John turns to look at the Almighty, the Alpha and the Omega, he sees Jesus.<a name=5:10></a> He sees what characterised the <i>Ancient of days</i>.<a name=5:11></a> <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#7:9">Daniel  7:9</a>,13.<a name=5:12></a> In Daniel, the Son of man is led to the Ancient of days, and receives the dominion.<a name=5:13></a> In <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:14">Revelation  1:14</a>, Jesus, the Son of man, has the character of the Ancient of days.<a name=5:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Jesus cannot present Himself as Man without the church and the Holy Ghost recognizing Him as God, Eternal, and Almighty, as the One who has dominion over the world.<a name=5:15></a> God gives us to understand His purposes concerning the world, and shews to us Jesus, who suffered, supremely exalted as Man.<a name=5:16></a> We see, when the Son of man is manifested in the glory (and so it was when sojourning here below), God Himself, the eternal God, as well as the man to whom all title to glory belongs.<a name=5:17></a> Jesus has the reward of having humbled and made Himself of no reputation for us.<a name=5:18></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#102">Psalm  102</a>He says, "He weakened my strength in the way; He shortened my days.<a name=5:19></a>" The answer is, "But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end.<a name=5:20></a>" John sees also the seven churches (things that are), and Christ in the midst of these churches, not as serving them.<a name=5:21></a> His garments descend to His feet; His girdle of gold is divine glory in judgment, not spiritually on oneself, but to be executed on others -- judicial firmness.<a name=5:22></a> His head reveals the Ancient of days.<a name=5:23></a> His eyes were piercing like fire in judgment.<a name=5:24></a> Glory and majesty were discovered in Him, and He held the representatives of the seven churches in the right hand of His power.<a name=5:25></a>

		Verse 18.<a name=6:3></a> Jesus, the Man once dead but now alive again, conqueror of hell and of death, takes away fear from him who finds death in the presence of His divine glory.<a name=6:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 19.<a name=6:5></a> We see here the division of the Apocalypse into three parts:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Firstly, <i>The things seen</i>, that is to say, the glory of Jesus such as we have seen it described.<a name=6:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Secondly, <i>The things that are</i>, or the seven churches.<a name=6:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thirdly, <i>The things to come after them</i>, or the prophecy; chapter 4:1.<a name=6:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The order of the book presents thus the Person of Jesus, Son of man in glory; the Eternal God; the churches, and Jesus as a judge in the midst of them; and then revelations concerning the world.<a name=6:9></a> Jesus is revealed here, not as the Head of the church, but as judge and ruler in the churches; not as the olive tree which gives the oil, or as the Head that distributes gifts, but as the Head who makes use only of threatenings and of rewards; not as servant or advocate, or shepherd of the sheep; but in a long robe, in the dignity of a judge, and like one who comes to see what light the candlesticks give.<a name=6:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is important to apprehend that <i>the general object of this book is the revelation</i> of the relations of God, as ruler, with the world, viewed as introducing into it Jesus as heir.<a name=6:11></a> It will be seen how much of difficulty this removes.<a name=6:12></a> The understanding of the book supposes a soul established in its relations with the Father, and with the Son to whom God will reveal His purposes towards the world, as God.<a name=6:13></a> It would be grievous and shameful for us not to be sufficiently of the family of God to feel interested in all His glory.<a name=6:14></a>

		<h3>CHAPTERS 2,3</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I avoided in my lectures saying anything on the seven churches as not being strictly part of the <i>prophecy</i>.<a name=6:15></a> For the satisfaction of my readers I shall add thereon only a few thoughts.<a name=6:16></a> There were doubtless seven churches thus named; but they were selected in order to present the thoughts of God to the whole church.<a name=6:17></a> The number seven is expressive of something spiritually complete.<a name=6:18></a> The seven churches are "the things which are," and "the things which are" end with the history

	<div class="paragraph">
		of the seven churches.<a name=7:1></a> "What was to happen after these" (chapter 1:19) cannot be considered as belonging to the present time in the sense in which this expression refers to the position in which John found himself.<a name=7:2></a> The prophetic details were outside of that period.<a name=7:3></a> They were the things which were to happen after it; that is to say, the prophetic details of this book were not comprised in "the things which are" considered severally as the time present of the churches.<a name=7:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the seven churches may be viewed under a twofold aspect.<a name=7:5></a> First, there were seven churches existing at that very time.<a name=7:6></a> But, then, the glory of Christ, judging in the midst of the churches, was certainly not confined to this; and the number seven guides our thoughts towards something which is <i>complete</i>.<a name=7:7></a> Are we then to think of all the churches at that time, or of the general history of the church on the earth?<a name=7:8></a> In the first place, it is the moral condition of the church, wherein that is to be found which is spoken of; and the judgment pronounced is pronounced upon such a condition, and is addressed to "<i>all</i> that have ears to hear," and would thus morally extend to all the churches existing at that time.<a name=7:9></a> But, inasmuch as it describes states distinct, differing one from the other, it is difficult to apply it to the whole church at any given period; and the thoughts are very naturally directed to periods in which the condition of the professing church may have been characterised by what is said concerning the churches placed in succession before us.<a name=7:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The expression "the things which are" very naturally adapts itself to this; for, as we have seen, it is difficult to apply, at any given time, seven very different states to the general condition of the church, and it is evident that the expression "the things which are" comprises more than what is understood by the seven churches in Asia.<a name=7:11></a> Now the state of the professing church, until it is rejected as a witness on the earth, is naturally described by "the things which are," as contrasted with the intentions of God in bringing in a new dispensation by the exercise of His power into the world.<a name=7:12></a> And this it is which distinguishes these two chapters from those which follow.<a name=7:13></a> The church is seen in a state of declension until she is spued out of the mouth of the Lord.<a name=7:14></a> Then comes the history of the throne.<a name=7:15></a> We may distinguish the seven churches of that time as presented to us historically (which do not perfectly set forth all God's thoughts) from the history of
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=8>[Page 8]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the church in general until the end: each of these things presents to us "the things which are.<a name=8:1></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is here, with regard to the form of prophecy, an important observation to be made.<a name=8:2></a> When the people of God are more or less still recognised by Him, the prophecy is addressed to the people.<a name=8:3></a> When they are no more recognised of God, then the ways of God are communicated to the prophet who declares His counsels concerning the world.<a name=8:4></a> Thus the prophets of the Old Testament speak to the people, while the people are recognised of God.<a name=8:5></a> Daniel, a captive in Babylon, receives visions concerning their relations with the nations, and the history of those nations: but the prophecy is not addressed to the people.<a name=8:6></a> Thus also the Apocalypse no longer recognises the church upon earth in the prophetic part of the book, and is not an address to the church itself.<a name=8:7></a> "The things which are," and what John saw of the glory of Christ, judging in the midst of the churches, no doubt, is addressed to the churches.<a name=8:8></a> In the prophetic part, the testimony is given to her -- is deposited with her, so to speak; but the word is not addressed to the church.<a name=8:9></a> The Lord had said, speaking of John, "but if I will that he tarry till I come "; John, the last of the apostles, bears personally to the churches the last testimony of Christ's relationship with them (according to their present state -- a state, it may be said, of transition, and where the churches are seen quite in a new light).<a name=8:10></a> As a symbolical person, his testimony lasts until the church is no more recognised at all; and prophecy takes the place of communication made direct to the church, and announces the introduction of the Firstborn in judgment (judgment of the apostasy and of the world), and the events which proceed from the throne and precede His introduction.<a name=8:11></a> It was necessary that the church should be put aside in order to speak of those things.<a name=8:12></a> Otherwise everything would have been done with a view to the church herself.<a name=8:13></a> The Lord is seen as the Lamb in the throne at the very beginning of the prophecy, as the One who has suffered in His own Person on the earth, and not as judging in the churches on the earth.<a name=8:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It would be impossible here to enter in detail upon the seven churches; it would be to write a book.<a name=8:15></a> The varied promises, descriptive of the heavenly portion that is to come, would deserve protracted study, as well as the peculiar insignia by which Christ is designated, and the relation between the

	<div class="paragraph">
		two; and also the connection of the latter with the state of the church in which they are severally found.<a name=9:1></a> I shall only endeavour to give a general outline, according to what we have seen.<a name=9:2></a> It is a state of transition.<a name=9:3></a> Christ is represented as a Judge in this book, judging either the churches or the world.<a name=9:4></a> He is no longer as the Head of the church communicating, in grace, blessings and precepts, or exhorting by the chosen members of the body, or girded with a towel washing the feet.<a name=9:5></a> He is judging the state of things and threatening them.<a name=9:6></a> At one time He threatens to remove the candlestick, when a church is not faithful to that which has been entrusted to her, as bearing testimony before the world.<a name=9:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another remark to be made here: God's candlestick.<a name=9:8></a> His government in the world was no longer at Jerusalem.<a name=9:9></a> God will govern the world by His Firstborn, and will prepare the way for Him by these judgments.<a name=9:10></a> But judgment begins at the house of God.<a name=9:11></a> The light -- the candlestick of God -- was there, and His name was upon them in the sight of the world.<a name=9:12></a> And whatever be its unfaithfulness, and however God may act in raising a testimony elsewhere before the world, until such a system be judged, as a system established of God, it bears its responsibility, and God acts in judgment towards it.<a name=9:13></a> Jerusalem was the seat of God's testimony.<a name=9:14></a> His candlestick had been there.<a name=9:15></a> I need not insist amongst Christians that the light and the presence of God were spiritually dwelling in the midst of Christians.<a name=9:16></a> Nevertheless, Jerusalem's responsibility and her position before the world only ceased in her destruction by the judgment of God.<a name=9:17></a> After this, God's candlestick, in a terrestrial sense, was in the professing church.<a name=9:18></a> Till then, Christians had been, to the eye of the world, a sect of the Jews.<a name=9:19></a> Thus we see Aquila and Priscilla at a distance from Rome, because Claudius had commanded that every Jew should depart from it.<a name=9:20></a> At Antioch, in the midst of the Gentiles, which was the starting-point of the labours of Paul, apostle of the Gentiles, the believers begin to have a peculiar name.<a name=9:21></a> They were first called Christians at Antioch; <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#11:26">Acts  11:26</a>.<a name=9:22></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#26:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>This is true in one sense, but also it was before God as in heaven. Morally speaking, no one could, as to the antitype, enter there but as new-born, and Christ lifted up from the earth was before God. The court was, in certain aspects, the court of heaven, and not the world outside. It was a place of transition. The brazen sea, for instance, which was in the court, is seen here in heaven; the souls under the altar (burnt offerings) are in heaven. Nor is there any veil here. "I, if I be lifted up," says Christ, "will draw all men unto me." He was then rejected by the earth, and (though not yet ascended into heaven) had ceased to be a living man, Messiah on the earth -- lifted up to God in glorifying Him -- He still was in view of man below, and thus became the perfect and attractive meeting place.

		<a class="footnote" name="#34:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>Some believe that the judgment itself of Antichrist is the third woe. I was made to say so in the first edition of these notes, but I doubt it. I cannot believe that the description given at the beginning of the chapter is that of the last days of the man of sin. The worship of the faithful and the temple of God are preserved intact, and the strong testimony rendered by the two witnesses secured against all attack, those who hurt them being killed. Now, if this be so, this would be the first half week, the other half remains yet to be fulfilled. (Compare @Matthew 24: 15.) I find it also difficult to believe that it is just at the time of the two witnesses being killed that all terminates. Now, it is at the end of the twelve hundred and sixty days. In chapter 12 we have twelve hundred and sixty days, of which it is said, "woe," etc., which resemble much more @Matthew 24. Neither does it seem to me right to call the judgment of God a woe. We must remember also that the dominion of the beast lasts twelve hundred and sixty days, and that the two witnesses live during the like period. Are they synchronical? I do not think so.

The Lamb had been slain; but in the Revelation it is ever rather the place He who had been slain takes than His death that is in question. It is that suffering Person that is brought forward. So here. Mercy and truth will then be met together; righteousness and peace will kiss each other. Truth shall flourish out of the earth, and righteousness shall look down from heaven. These are God's ways. No doubt this was morally accomplished on the cross; but that Psalm speaks of its manifestation in result on earth, and so here. It is the manifestation on earth of these things rather that is sung, not that in which they are known to faith.

		These two verses teach us two very important facts: first that death is the natural portion for man, and after that the judgment; but, secondly, that to believers this death and judgment have been met by Christ, and, consequently, they expect with joy His second appearing; they look for Him.<a name=108:7></a> Here is the distinction between the saints and the world.<a name=108:8></a> The reception, through grace, or refusal of the love of God, creates the contrast, so far as man is concerned, and not any efforts of his own, for he has no power of his own to meet that which he is already in -- namely, death!<a name=108:9></a> But the believer finds that death and judgment have been met by Christ on his behalf; he consequently loves Him in remembrance of His work; and to such Christ will appear the second time without sin.<a name=108:10></a> No doubt He was so <i>personally</i> the first time; but then He came into all the circumstances of sin, He was made sin <i>for us</i>.<a name=108:11></a> But, as regards believers, He has, at His second coming, nothing more to do with sin: it will be unto salvation, to put them into possession of the results of His first coming.<a name=108:12></a> Salvation will be the consummation of what we at present believe.<a name=108:13></a> Seeing Him at the right hand of God, we look for a completion of bliss at His second appearing; and this belief being in the heart, the results are seen in the life -- the church's position is that of resting on the <i>effects</i> of His first coming, and it looks for all its <i>results</i> in the second.<a name=108:14></a>

		1. There have been three great things, or systems, set under God in the world, which have all failed; viz.<a name=117:11></a>, the Jews, the Gentiles, and the church of God (as to the testimony committed to it); and a short history of their failure, and of God's future intentions to them, is needful.<a name=117:12></a> When God pronounced "Lo-ammi" (not my people) on the Jews, He delivered power into the hands of the Gentiles, in the person of Nebuchadnezzar and his successors; and it has continued ever since.<a name=117:13></a> When the Jews or Gentiles (the fourth monarchy, or Roman empire, at that moment appearing in universal dominion) agreed in rejecting the Messiah, God brought in the church -- a heavenly people -- not to take to itself earthly dominion, but down here to be a witness to Christ, as set at the right hand of God.<a name=117:14></a> Now the scripture represents all these as failing -- Jews, Gentiles, and Christendom as such.<a name=117:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2. With regard to the Jews (at present Lo-ammi, or not my people), it is necessary to see that their failure arose from their disobedience to a law which they had promised to observe, and which they consummated in the rejection of Messiah; but they will be restored to the land of Canaan, owing to the free mercy of God, on account of His promises to Abraham, notwithstanding their failure, for which they have been and will yet have to be punished.<a name=117:16></a> In <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#13:15">Genesis  13:15</a>, we find the land of Canaan given to Abraham and to his seed for ever; and in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#15:13">Genesis  15:13</a>, 14, the prophetic announcement of the captivity of Egypt, and of the recovery thence, and the gift of the land is again made to his seed by an unconditional covenant of God.<a name=117:17></a> See also <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#17:8">Genesis  17:8</a>.<a name=117:18></a> We know that the former part of this took place; that is, the children of Israel were delivered from Egypt, and brought to Mount

But while Scripture distinguishes the two, they are in fact one and the same. The difficulty arises from this, that the church of God, instead of keeping its heavenly conversation or citizenship (@Philippians 3: 20), has leagued itself with the powers of the world, so that they are become one and the same thing to all appearance. Let it be borne in mind, then that the powers of the world mentioned in this lecture are not heathen powers, but those bearing the name of Christ. A prayerful study of the middle portion of the book of Revelation, where the beast and the false prophet are treated of, must be resorted to by those who wish for clear news on this point of the subject, where they will see the issue of this combination.

		STUDIES ON THE BOOK OF DANIEL¦
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<h3>PREFACE</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The meditations herewith offered to Christians pretend in no way to give a complete explanation of the book of Daniel.<a name=123:1></a> The following is the account of them.<a name=123:2></a> They were delivered before a small company, whose minds had been already occupied about prophecy, and who had desired to have some help as to this book.<a name=123:3></a> The author imparted to them, in a course of lectures, the light which he possessed.<a name=123:4></a> Notes were taken at the time, and, the manuscript having fallen into the hands of a third person, he (supposing that the notes would be valuable to others) began to print them.<a name=123:5></a> The author offered no hindrance, except the doubt whether they were worth the trouble, and in yielding he did what was needful for the publication, though at some distance from the place where it was undertaken.<a name=123:6></a> It will be seen, that a certain basis of interpretation is supposed as being already recognised in the mind of the reader.<a name=123:7></a> In the study of the prophecies especially we must expect to go through a certain exercise of mind.<a name=123:8></a> But if it is not worth while to take thus much pains, neither is it to read these lectures nor the book they treat of.<a name=123:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The author's confidence is in God, who, if He approve this feeble effort to help the weak ones, will extend His all-powerful aid in giving them understanding, for wisdom comes from God.<a name=123:10></a> It is to Him and to His grace, dear reader, that the author recommends you, asking your prayers for him, in case you get the least profit from this little book.<a name=123:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The book of Daniel has reference to the time during which Israel, the people of God, are under subjection to the Gentiles.<a name=123:12></a> At its opening we discover an accomplishment of the threat made to Hezekiah; <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#39:6">Isaiah  39:6</a>, 7.<a name=123:13></a> The throne of God has

		been taken from Jerusalem; the power and the kingdom have been transferred to the Gentiles; and Israel, as to its actual state (being no longer, by the judgment of God, His people) is kept in captivity.<a name=124:1></a> But God does not abandon them: only He administers His blessings according to their actual necessity.<a name=124:2></a> The things most needful for them to know, under their existing trials, were the history of this dominion of the Gentiles, to which they were subjected, and also the effect of these changes upon the promises which belonged to them.<a name=124:3></a> And as the glory of God was to be considered in this great transference of power, it was important to know how the Gentiles would use it, or what their conduct would be, whether towards God or themselves (the Jews), under this responsibility conferred on them.<a name=124:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The book, then, embraces two principal subjects: Firstly, the character and conduct of the four monarchies, which occupy the period called "the times of the Gentiles" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#21:24">Luke  21:24</a>), namely, from the time that God had retired from Jerusalem (His throne being no longer there), and had transferred imperial power over the world to the Gentiles, until the time of the re-establishment of His throne.<a name=124:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And, secondly, the relationship of these nations with Israel His people, during the period in which the supremacy that had been confided to them was in exercise.<a name=124:6></a> And all this is of practical importance.<a name=124:7></a> For the Christian is informed of the result of the politics of this world, and, being "warned of things not seen as yet," he separates himself, whether in heart or in action, from all that of which the result will be so sad.<a name=124:8></a> Besides, an acquaintance beforehand with all that is to take place keeps him tranquil and composed.<a name=124:9></a> There is no need that he should give his heart to the world which surrounds him, for he knows by the written revelation of God both its course and its end.<a name=124:10></a> But further, such prophetic intimation is precious to us, not alone because it refers to Christ, and to the people beloved of God, but also because, in every communication which God makes to us, there is a sensible joy in the very fact that He speaks to us.<a name=124:11></a> Are not our souls happy in communion with Him?<a name=124:12></a> Now this is the case in the prophecies, as in every other part of the word; we feel our nearness to Him and His goodness to us.<a name=124:13></a> Thus our faith in Him is strengthened, and the sanctification of our souls increased and established.<a name=124:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This book accordingly is divided into two parts, sufficiently distinct, according to the two great subjects which it contains: six chapters occupy the first, and six others the second part.<a name=125:1></a> The first six contain, not the communications made to Daniel, except to interpret them, but the dreams of Nebuchadnezzar, or the things which befell the heads of the empire.<a name=125:2></a> We have the great general principles of the Gentile monarchies given to us, or their public history in the world announced to their rulers or manifested in their conduct.<a name=125:3></a> The last six chapters are communications made to the prophet himself, and reveal not only the history of these empires, but what they are in the eyes of God; they also furnish details of their (the Gentiles') relationship with the Jews, and of the worship still maintained by the Jewish people.<a name=125:4></a> This last was important to Daniel, who, as a prophet, had the people and glory of God at heart, as well as the general history of these empires.<a name=125:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is instructive to mark the character of the man who became the depositary of the intentions of God in this time of distress and captivity of His people.<a name=125:6></a> First, he refuses to defile his soul in partaking of the delicate food of this world.<a name=125:7></a> God, who prepares and orders everything for the well-being of those who walk faithfully, in whatever circumstances they are placed, disposed the heart of the chief of the eunuchs in favour of Daniel and his three companions: this eunuch, under whose charge they were, conceived a great regard for them.<a name=125:8></a> Moreover, God answers the prayers of Daniel, who "became fairer and fatter in flesh," than any of those who had given themselves over to the ways and nourishment of this world.<a name=125:9></a> In a word, Daniel is faithful in all that constitutes a complete separation from the world, according to the Jewish rites, in refusing to eat of meats from the table of a pagan monarch; and this conduct of faith, which was in appearance blamable, meets the approval of God.<a name=125:10></a> The personal behaviour of Daniel is the basis of and introduction to the revelation of the whole book.<a name=125:11></a> It is the same with us.<a name=125:12></a> Separation from the world -- a decided refusal to have our portion in that which it furnishes -- puts us into a position to receive those communications from God, which, whilst their fulness is contained in the written word, we never receive but through the direct teaching of God (that is, for it to be the teaching of faith), whatever be the instrument which God may make use of to impart such communications to us.<a name=125:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God soon finds an occasion in which Daniel is to serve Him as a witness, after having, through His grace, disposed him for the undertaking.<a name=126:1></a> He often acts by ways which leave the world completely at fault.<a name=126:2></a> He permits Nebuchadnezzar's memory to fail him, in order to force him into dependence upon the prophet whom God had chosen to shew forth His divine wisdom.<a name=126:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Notwithstanding, at the actual moment, Daniel knew no more than others how to resolve the difficulty.<a name=126:4></a> God made him feel his dependence; but he had faith, and faith and dependence are identified.<a name=126:5></a> At the instance of Daniel, he and his companions seek the God of heaven in prayer;<a href="#126:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> God answers them, making use of all the difficulties of the case to identify Himself with the poor remnant of His people.<a name=126:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hereupon Daniel's first act is, not to hasten to the king to inform him of the discovery of the secret, and to rejoice in the deliverance, but he turns with thanksgiving to the God who had heard him.<a name=126:7></a> He attributes to Him all that could give comfort to the remnant during the supremacy of these ungodly and rebellious Gentile powers (chapter 2: 21).<a name=126:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Daniel, when introduced into the presence of the king, is not elated; he conceals himself, so to speak, behind the glory of God.<a name=126:9></a> It is when we understand how to humble ourselves thoroughly, that we are truly exalted.<a name=126:10></a> If Daniel disappears, God Himself is manifested in him.<a name=126:11></a> Oh that we might have wisdom and spiritual power to hide ourselves thus behind Jesus, in order that He might be put into the foreground!<a name=126:12></a> Every such act is a great and precious triumph.<a name=126:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the interpretation of the dream, a few words will suffice, as the light upon this is almost universal.<a name=126:14></a> All acknowledge the dream to speak of the four great monarchies, viz.<a name=126:15></a>, the Babylonian, Persian, Greek, and Roman.<a name=126:16></a> In verses 37, 38 dominion is given to Nebuchadnezzar by the God of heaven -- a universal dominion -- absolute in its character over the earth, though not over the seas.<a name=126:17></a> There is no information given how far this dominion has been realised, but the gift was bestowed; and it is the first monarchy which, it appears, possessed this power in the most pure and absolute way.<a name=126:18></a> It was in the person of its chief "the head of gold.<a name=126:19></a>" The fourth was to

		break everything in pieces by its power; but at the end it was to be divided, and in this condition it was to be both strong and weak; a result of the union of the empire and of the original principle of its existence with heterogeneous elements (that is, in my judgment, of barbarians with that which was, properly speaking, Roman).<a name=127:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		At the end, the God of heaven, will establish the kingdom of Christ, who will put aside all these monarchies by an act of judgment.<a name=127:2></a> We must bear in mind that the kingdom of Christ in this place is His kingdom established in power in the world, and not the blessed influence of the gospel of His grace.<a name=127:3></a> The first act of the little stone, before it grows and becomes a great mountain which fills the whole earth, is to fall upon the statue, so that it becomes as the chaff of the summer threshing floor.<a name=127:4></a> The stone does not become a mount in until after that.<a name=127:5></a> In other words, when Christ shall have executed a judgment which shall break in pieces and destroy the power of the Gentiles, then His kingdom (an earthly kingdom, and one still of judgment) shall fill the earth.<a name=127:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 2 the moral history of these monarchies is not touched upon nor their conduct signalised.<a name=127:7></a> These will have their place in the four following chapters.<a name=127:8></a> I shall only here point out the marks which are given to us as characterising them, as we shall return to them in another lecture.<a name=127:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The <i>first</i> is idolatry, or the civil power endeavouring to make the people submit to a law of unity in worship, the object being a statue set up by the civil power.<a name=127:10></a> The <i>second</i> is that the heads of the empire become beasts.<a name=127:11></a> That is, they lose the consciousness of being set in relationship with God; and, instead of being in dependence upon Him according to the light given from above, which is the only and true glory of man, they, having lost this light, descend to the rank of beasts.<a name=127:12></a> The <i>third</i> is impiety, seen in the conduct of the imperial power towards the Jews, and the God of the Jews, whose name, and all that had reference to His worship, it dishonours.<a name=127:13></a> The <i>fourth</i> is self-exaltation.<a name=127:14></a> The head of the empire makes himself God, and forbids prayer to be addressed to any other than himself.<a name=127:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In all these events the history ends by the exaltation of the true God.<a name=127:16></a> In the first, the Gentile acknowledges the God of those who had preferred the fiery furnace to idolatry.<a name=127:17></a> In the second, it is the Gentiles themselves who confess the God of

		heaven, who humbled them when they walked in pride -- a pride of which Babylon was the centre.<a name=128:1></a> In the third, it is judgment executed against the "wicked king.<a name=128:2></a>" In the fourth, it is not alone the God of heaven who is proclaimed, but His power is established with authority, and His kingdom is acknowledged as that which shall endure for ever.<a name=128:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<h3>LECTURE 2 -- CHAPTERS 3-6</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will remember that chapter 2 gave a general history of the period taken up by the whole of Daniel.<a name=128:4></a> This was revealed in a dream which Daniel recalled to Nebuchadnezzar, and of which he gave the interpretation.<a name=128:5></a> It is the history of the times of the Gentiles.<a name=128:6></a> The four monarchies are brought before us, and their final dispersion, by the judgment which the little stone (the kingdom of Christ -- Christ Himself) will execute against the whole power of the Gentiles.<a name=128:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would press again upon your attention that, after having destroyed the image, and not until then, the little stone became a great mountain, which filled the whole earth.<a name=128:8></a> We stated that the four following chapters (that is, to the end of chapter 6) gave the character and conduct of these empires; and that, instead of existing in dependence upon God, they are found in rebellion against Him, persecute His people, and exalt themselves against Him.<a name=128:9></a> The consequence is judgment.<a name=128:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 3 we observe the first and principal sin, namely, idolatry, as marking Gentile power, or the power which reigns during the times of the Gentiles.<a name=128:11></a> In the succeeding chapter, we observe that these empires, instead of being subject to God, become beasts, that is, they lose their proper under, standing, and act as beasts -- as wild beasts, who cease to be in subjection (all men, in their true place, acknowledging their subjection to God), and who lose their understanding.<a name=128:12></a> In chapter 5 there is open impiety; and in chapter 6 the head of the empire exalts himself as God.<a name=128:13></a> Then follow details and circumstances of these empires, and their special relationship with the people of God.<a name=128:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The principles are given us in the first six chapters, and the details in the remaining six.<a name=128:15></a> The first thing which the civil power sets up is idolatry, with the object of establishing a
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=129>[Page 129]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		religious unity, but always in separating the people from the true God, and in putting something in His place.<a name=129:1></a> This circumstance serves as an occasion for trying the faithfulness of God's people and the manner of it.<a name=129:2></a> Nebuchadnezzar commands the people, yea, even all the nations (for there were many under his dominion) to worship a statue.<a name=129:3></a> This is idolatry.<a name=129:4></a> (Consult <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#3:4">Daniel  3:4</a>-7 for the words of the proclamation.<a name=129:5></a>) This is not an unusual way with Satan; he excites in the civil power the desire of unity; and there is no more powerful motive for the mass than the influence of religion.<a name=129:6></a><a href="#129:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> Satan impels the civil powers to establish unity, in order that everything under their authority should be well ordered and regulated.<a name=129:7></a> It was thus with Nebuchadnezzar: he sets up this image in the province of Babylon, and demands the assent of all the governors to its reception and worship.<a name=129:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I repeat, that such a religious act is a powerful means of influencing the mass, and of holding them in submission, united in one community, and bound to the civil power, which is the centre of such religion, or at all events supports it, and is identified with it.<a name=129:9></a> But whenever this is the case, there must be persecution -- it may be more or less violent -- but persecution there will be.<a name=129:10></a> We see it in the present case.<a name=129:11></a> Nebuchadnezzar's alternative is, "Whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, shall be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.<a name=129:12></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is yet another important consequence as characteristic of Gentile power; I mean impiety.<a name=129:13></a> Impiety not only refuses to respect the conscience, but, what is worse, disallows the rights of God.<a name=129:14></a> Respect for the conscience is necessary enough, but the rights of God are infinitely more so.<a name=129:15></a> Observe the words of the king: "Who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hand?<a name=129:16></a>" (verse 15).<a name=129:17></a> This is impiety -- that principle of blasphemy which characterises the beast under all times and circumstances.<a name=129:18></a> His thought is of the power which he (the beast) possesses and holds.<a name=129:19></a> May we remember that it is God who has given it, and who overrules it!<a name=129:20></a> (Compare <a href="../bible/Habakkuk.htm#1:11">Habakkuk  1:11</a>, 15-17.<a name=129:21></a>) Impiety, in forgetting the source of power, would arrogate to itself all its rights in spite of God Himself.<a name=129:22></a> Now, if unity be maintained, when God's own rights are set

		aside, it immediately becomes idolatry; for we fall into the hands of the enemy when we are at a distance from the true God.<a name=130:1></a> And when the civil power endeavours to establish this unity, it puts aside not only the rights of conscience, but the rights of God Himself.<a name=130:2></a> This applies in an especial manner to the word of God.<a name=130:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not only that man has a right to the word of God, as between him and his neighbour, but there is a more sacred right which is interfered with, if we deprive him of it: it is that God has the right to address what He will to the souls of men, and, having addressed the word to them, those who would deprive men of it, derogate from the rights and despise the authority of God, who has seen good to send it to them.<a name=130:4></a> Suppose that I have servants, dependents, to whom I send orders, evidently, if any one hinder the servants from receiving these orders, he interferes, not only with their rights, but with mine; and this is the great question: God no doubt will make inquisition for all this.<a name=130:5></a> It is bad enough to violate the conscience of another man to satisfy one's own wickedness; but here Nebuchadnezzar entirely set aside the prerogative of the true God.<a name=130:6></a> And this is the principle of blasphemy which attaches to the Gentiles from the beginning.<a name=130:7></a> This was the first act of the head of gold; and such is the commencement of the power of the Gentiles as presented to us in this chapter.<a name=130:8></a>

		On the other hand we have a touching picture in Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego.<a name=130:9></a> They are not at all in alarm or disquietude.<a name=130:10></a> "We are not careful to answer thee in this matter" (verse 16) is their answer to the king.<a name=130:11></a> Does this confidence issue in their escape from the threatened penalty?<a name=130:12></a> By no means; they do not escape.<a name=130:13></a> God allows them to be put to the proof; He does not manifest Himself beforehand, but permits Nebuchadnezzar to fulfil his threats.<a name=130:14></a> They are cast into the furnace of fire, as Daniel was afterwards into the den of lions.<a name=130:15></a> Whilst they would not obey the will of Nebuchadnezzar in violating their conscience, they offered no resistance to the persecution, but, as to their bodies, they submit entirely to his commands; and what is the consequence?<a name=130:16></a> They are loosed by the fire, and nothing is burnt but the chains with which the world had bound them; moreover, they have the Son of God as their companion in the furnace.<a name=130:17></a> The consequence of this interference of God in behalf of His poor servants was that a confession was forced from the civil power

		You will observe that in this explanation of the conduct of the little horn, the daily sacrifice is not mentioned, its taking away is not attributed to him; and thus we perceive the importance of the correction of verse 11.<a name=158:2></a> He oppresses the Jews, and triumphs over them by the subtility of his spirit; he will destroy many by peace and prosperity.<a name=158:3></a> This is the account of a power which emanates from the Greek monarchy in the east, one who will act in the midst of the Jewish people, and who will be destroyed because he exalts himself against Christ at the end.<a name=158:4></a> So much for his locality, his conduct, and his end.<a name=158:5></a> The only mention that Daniel makes of the daily sacrifice and of the sanctuary, is in the last two verses.<a name=158:6></a> "And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is true.<a name=158:7></a>"

		A single remark will suffice concerning the calculations of dates that have been made; I have made them myself, and I have taken all possible pains to resolve that of the "two thousand three hundred days" (verse 14), so that I do not mean it as condemning others, when I avow that I do not think they can be counted as years, and I am inclined to believe that these days were accomplished of old.<a name=158:8></a> But, in any case, if dates are to be assigned, we must remember that the subject is the Jews and Jerusalem, and these dates must therefore be applied to the Jews and Jerusalem, and not to the affairs of Christendom.<a name=158:9></a>

		There may be analogous circumstances in Christendom, because the mystery of iniquity has already set in, for although the wicked one has not yet been revealed, his principles and his pride are found in its developments, etc.<a name=158:10></a>; but if we are to speak with exactness, and to ask if these things have been precisely accomplished, then we must apply these passages to Jerusalem and the Jews, namely, to what is to occur at the end of the indignation.<a name=158:11></a> Now certainly the end of the indignation has not yet happened.<a name=158:12></a>

		In conclusion, the subject of this lecture is one with which we may appear to have but little concern.<a name=158:13></a> The other little horn has more connection with us, because it belongs to the last beast; and we have to do with it, as living in those countries which will come under its dominion, as France, England, etc.<a name=158:14></a> (which formed a part of the Roman empire); and also, as

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 7 we traced the history of the four beasts in general, specially of the little horn who spoke great things, who blasphemed against God, who was the enemy of the saints, who represented the beast -- that is, who acted as he chose, according to the power of this beast; and in chapter 8 we have the history of the horn who will be raised up from one of the four Greek monarchies, and who at the end will lift himself up against the Lord of lords, and will be destroyed without hand.<a name=159:4></a> The prophet now directs his thoughts and heart towards a subject, different from that in the midst of which he stood, namely, to the desolations of Jerusalem.<a name=159:5></a> Such is the theme of this chapter.<a name=159:6></a> And how was he led into this train of thought?<a name=159:7></a> Simply because those words were on his heart; How long, O Lord!<a name=159:8></a> It is a mark of faith thus to cry, when judgments are weighing heavily upon the people of God: for faith views the people according to the promises which God has made to them.<a name=159:9></a> A person who has laid hold of the mind of God, whose faith is in exercise, and whose heart responds, however imperfectly,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus when affliction weighs heavily upon the people of God, and they are not enjoying all the privileges which faith realises as belonging to them, faith says, "How long, O Lord!<a name=160:2></a>" On the one hand, such a one cannot rest satisfied with the misfortunes under which the people of God are labouring; and upon the other, he knows that it is impossible for God to abandon His people.<a name=160:3></a> Faith says, This state of suffering will have an end; the wicked, it is true, will not be relieved, but the people of God must be.<a name=160:4></a> Hence the frequency of such expressions in the Psalms and Prophets as "How long, O Lord!<a name=160:5></a>" and "There is none to say, How long!<a name=160:6></a>" -- there is no one who knows how to count on the faithfulness of God.<a name=160:7></a> When under chastening, there is no faith to use this expression, a worse one is used, "I have loved strangers, and after them will I go"; and the people abandon themselves to wickedness; <a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#2:25">Jeremiah  2:25</a>.<a name=160:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Daniel is here acting in faith.<a name=160:9></a> He had, moreover, the consolation of knowing, that when God pronounced the judgment of captivity upon His people, He had also declared its limit.<a name=160:10></a> Jeremiah had predicted that it should last seventy years, and that afterwards God would judge Babylon by the hand of Cyrus.<a name=160:11></a> Hereupon, wrapped up in the interests of the people of God, his thoughts are occupied with this promised deliverance.<a name=160:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the faith which comprehends the goodness of God, and sighs for the time when the people shall enjoy their privileges, always confesses the sin which has obliged God to deprive His people for a time of these privileges.<a name=160:13></a> Faith never becomes discouraged, as if God were unfaithful; on the contrary, it insists upon the blame being with the people, and that God has only acted faithfully in thus dealing with them.<a name=160:14></a> Our chapter begins in this way.<a name=160:15></a> The interest which Daniel felt in his people led him to the consideration of the prophet Jeremiah, and then he entreats the Lord to confirm this blessing which He had promised by Jeremiah, that is, that He would accomplish the deliverance of His people from captivity.<a name=160:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another important fact which we remark here, and which was manifested in the Lord Jesus in perfection, is, that faith

		always thoroughly identifies itself with the affliction in which the people are found; and more even, with all the sins of the people of God.<a name=161:1></a> This is the distinguishing mark of the Spirit of Christ.<a name=161:2></a> Christ, indeed, went much further, inasmuch as He was able to make atonement for those sins, with which He identified Himself; but faith, according to its measure, always does so.<a name=161:3></a> The faith may be very feeble, but if there be any sense of the privileges of the people of God, and of the glory of God in His people, faith must have reference to this glory.<a name=161:4></a> But if it considers the glory, it considers also the sins which have been the occasion of the chastisement.<a name=161:5></a> Faith identifies itself with the state of the people, and by placing itself in their condition, perceives the cause of the judgment; for faith identifies the glory of God with His people, and itself with both; and the state of the people before God becomes the principle which animates the heart; and the more faith there is, according to the measure of its intelligence, the more does it enter into the depths into which the offenders have fallen, pass their sins in review, and confess them in identification with them; and if faith did not do this, there could be no presenting of these sins in confession, in order to their being pardoned.<a name=161:6></a> The Spirit which is in us (and yet more fully than the spirit of prophecy)<a href="#161:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> necessarily looks at the thing morally.<a name=161:7></a> My distress at the condition of the saints is in every sense incomplete, unless the cause of that condition in God's sight is taken notice of -- just as the high priest confessed all the sins of the people upon the scape goat.<a name=161:8></a>

		It is fully admitted, that there may be imperfection in the act; but according to the principles of faith, there must be identification -- a full confession before God.<a name=161:9></a> If I thought to get remission of sins (in the sense of removing chastenings) by partial confession, or without having felt their enormity, it is evident I should be mocking the just government of God; so that it is absolutely necessary, if I wish to suffer with Christ, for His church (and the case of the Jews serves morally for us), if I am led by His Spirit in love and care for His sheep, that I should humble myself, recognising the fallen condition of the

	<div class="paragraph">
		We often find in Scripture some apparently little circumstance which is an index to us of the thoughts of the Spirit of God.<a name=181:3></a> Thus the date of the third year of Cyrus opens a field of interesting thought, for the position in which Daniel was found enabled God, so to speak, to continue to reveal to him His intentions about the people.<a name=181:4></a> Evidently God had separated Daniel from the things which were doing for the momentary resettling of the people, that He might lead his heart still onward to the "end of the indignation" which really still subsisted.<a name=181:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is also another subject of instruction here, which I would not omit.<a name=181:6></a> I allude to the actings of God by means of angels, and how there were demons who sought to hinder the ministry of the providence of God, as to His people.<a name=181:7></a> "Fear not," says the angel to Daniel, "for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words" (verse 12).<a name=181:8></a> Nevertheless, the answer of God by the angel did not arrive until three weeks after.<a name=181:9></a> Then the angel relates to Daniel how this happened, and the difficulties he had to encounter at the court of Persia, by the opposition of the prince of the kingdom against the Jews, and that Michael, one of the chief princes, had come to help him.<a name=181:10></a> Daniel had known nothing of all this.<a name=181:11></a> God, in this way, exercises the obedience of His angels, and at the same time puts the faith of His servants to the test.<a name=181:12></a> Thus, then, is Daniel pre-occupied with his people, and with the glory of God in their midst; he cannot content himself with anything short of the accomplishment of the promises, and therefore he humbles and identifies himself with the misery and affliction of the people, according to the Spirit of Him who said, "In all their affliction He was afflicted.<a name=181:13></a>" Then God, who has given His servant grace thus to behave, acts from on high to reveal all His purpose to him, putting at the same time his patience to the proof, whilst the angel is combating at the court of Persia.<a name=181:14></a> I have no doubt it is the same for us; God also puts our faith to the trial.<a name=181:15></a> It is not that He does not hear and answer (He knows perfectly beforehand what the end will be); but He wishes to see if faith goes to the end of the difficulty, and then He answers.<a name=181:16></a> Faith, which is much more precious than gold which perishes,

	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 14.<a name=182:6></a> "Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days.<a name=182:7></a>" Here is the answer to the affliction of Daniel, but an answer not yet to be accomplished.<a name=182:8></a> There are two ways of judging of the thoughts of God as to His people.<a name=182:9></a> The first is to consider the condition in which God had placed them in the beginning -- how He had formed and fashioned them of old: the second is to consider (in what state the church will be found, or, to express it in reference to the case of Daniel), in what condition the people of God will be found at the end, when God shall have accomplished His counsels concerning them.<a name=182:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus, when Daniel considered the actual condition of his people, they might be found to possess many blessings from God and chastisements also; but the thoughts of the prophet, or spiritual man, would be either toward the state in which God had placed them in the beginning or toward that in which they will be found at the end.<a name=182:11></a> The same may be said of man in the abstract.<a name=182:12></a> If I think of my actual condition, I may either revert back to Adam without sin, or I may look forward to the resurrection state, in which I shall be hereafter, and realise in spirit either the one or the other; and compare my present state with the state of Adam in innocence, or of Christ in glory.<a name=182:13></a> So with the church and the Jew.<a name=182:14></a> If I consider the latter, when first established in his privileges, or at the end in the glory of the Messiah, both the one and the other evidences the state of imperfection which existed at the time of their return from the Babylonish captivity.<a name=182:15></a> Again, if I consider the church at the beginning, I see the effect of the power of the Spirit of God; but I can also, by examining the promises of God, view the church when she will be in glory with Christ; and in either case her present weakness is apparent.<a name=182:16></a> Daniel did these two things.<a name=182:17></a> In his confession, in chapter 9, he had considered much more the past condition of the people, whilst here it is much more their future, such as will ensue at the conclusion of the trials of chapter 12.<a name=182:18></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#199:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>It seems to me that these words are added to complete the picture; for the principal part of the prophecy is occupied with the details of that part of the people who are found in the land when the wicked one shall be in the exercise of his terrible and malicious power. But in this verse the lot of those who had been lost, and were to be gathered from among the nations, is given to us. These only enter as accessory into the scheme of the prophecy (this portion of the people having been without the limits of the prophecy, not having entered into the land to figure as the Jewish people). It is for this reason that they are represented as "sleeping in the dust of the earth."

		REMARKS ON A PART OF DANIEL¦
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My Dear Brother, <br>I send you some remarks on an interesting part of prophecy, including some principles long ago remarked, and recalled by recent study of some parts of Daniel.<a name=210:1></a> I shall be short, my object being to throw out the grounds of judgment rather than to reason on them.<a name=210:2></a> It has been long my conviction that there are two very distinct parties engaged in the trials of Jerusalem in the latter day.<a name=210:3></a> The alliance of Jerusalem with the one is the chief occasion of the desolation brought on by the other.<a name=210:4></a> This other is habitually termed the Assyrian in Isaiah.<a name=210:5></a> I now proceed to give you the elements of certain passages which seem to me to throw light on these points, and to facilitate the understanding of Daniel.<a name=210:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, the indignation, see <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#10">Isaiah  10</a>we have the revelation that the rod in the hand of the Assyrian is the Lord's indignation.<a name=210:7></a> This indignation is to cease in the destruction of the Assyrian.<a name=210:8></a> The characteristic term for this closing period is the indignation of Jehovah against the nation.<a name=210:9></a> We find, in <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#8:19">Daniel  8:19</a>, the expositor, who tells Daniel that he will make him know what is in the last end of the indignation, for at the time appointed the end shall be.<a name=210:10></a> The wilful king prospers till this indignation is filled up.<a name=210:11></a> When the overflowing scourge (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#28">Isaiah  28</a>), which is a flood and a treading down (compare <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#9:27">Daniel  9:27</a> and <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#8:13">Daniel  8:13</a>), comes through Ephraim (that is from the north), the scornful men which dwell at Jerusalem have made a covenant with death and are at agreement with hell, and hence hope to escape the overflowing scourge.<a name=210:12></a> But, as there is a foundation-stone for faith, so judgment is laid to the line, and the overflowing scourge passes through and they are trodden down by it.<a name=210:13></a> We have then the period of the indignation and the special instrument of it (this attack of the Assyrian being repeatedly referred to in Isaiah, compare <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#83">Psalm  83</a>).<a name=210:14></a> We have also the fact, that, when the scourge of desolation passes through, the rulers at Jerusalem had made an

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The distinction we have at the close of <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#30">Isaiah  30</a>, where it seems to me the king is a distinct personage (Hebrews <i>gam hoo lammelek</i>), "Tophet[-h] is prepared of old, for the king also it is prepared.<a name=211:2></a>" These passages lead me to another expression of importance in this respect, and which also links together Daniel and these passages in Isaiah (Hebrew <i>chalah veneheratsah</i>) the consumption decreed.<a name=211:3></a> You will find this in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#10:23">Isaiah  10:23</a> (and something like it in verse 22) in connection with the indignation, and the Assyrian, and a very small remnant left of Israel from the judgment, but a determined one of God.<a name=211:4></a> In <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#28">Isaiah  28</a>the judgment is clearly on Israel.<a name=211:5></a> Coming, as I have said, as to its progress through Ephraim, it finds the rulers of Jerusalem in league with death; and they are warned (verse 22) not to be mockers, because (Hebrew <i>chalah veneheratsah</i>) a consumption is determined on the whole earth (land).<a name=211:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#9:27">Daniel  9:27</a>, we find the same expression translated "the consummation," and that determined.<a name=211:7></a> I apprehend the force is "for the overspreading of abominations [the protection of idols, which makes the great charge against the Jews of the latter day a desolator (<i>m'shomehm</i>)] there shall be a desolator, until the consumption decreed be poured on the desolate"; that is, the "overspreading of abominations" (<i>al c'maph shikkutsim</i>), whatever that may be taken to be, is the cause why the consumption decreed is poured on the desolate.<a name=211:8></a> Some take it as a fact, or prefer the margin.<a name=211:9></a> As I take the sense of the English translation to be just, I venture on Hebrew ground, but only to put questions.<a name=211:10></a> I suppose the Hebrew may mean "because," or "for," as in English.<a name=211:11></a> Next, is it not certain, according to the points, and the regular Hebrew construction, both from letters and accents, that it is because of the protection of idols; and that the idols of the desolator is not the connection in the Hebrew?<a name=211:12></a> The best translation I have access to concurs in this.<a name=211:13></a> If so, the sense, as it seems to me to be, is clear, namely, "because of the protection of idols [there shall be] a desolator, until the consumption decreed" -- this appointed measure of wrath (against Israel).<a name=211:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think the reading of the passages quoted, in Isaiah, shews plainly that the decreed consuming or accomplishment of judgment applies to Israel, and such a statement accords with the whole testimony of God's word on the subject.<a name=211:15></a> This

		confirms the English translation "on the desolate.<a name=212:1></a>" And here again I appeal to my Hebrew friends.<a name=212:2></a> The usual sense of the Hebrew words (<i>shamehm</i> and <i>shomehm</i>) is, I apprehend, "to be desolate.<a name=212:3></a>" The word used here (<i>shomehm</i>) is several times used for Jerusalem desolate, by Jeremiah in Lamentations, and in other parts of Scripture, as to it and other subjects.<a name=212:4></a><a href="#212:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> No case of the active use is alleged by Gesenius, but this passage, which proves of course nothing, and <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#12:11">Daniel  12:11</a> which rests on a similar basis, and chapter 8: 13, all involve the question to be decided.<a name=212:5></a> For either of the last two cases, "desolate" or "desolating" gives a sense according to truth; but would in any case (<i>shomehm</i>) be "causing others to desolate"?<a name=212:6></a> However, of this in a moment.<a name=212:7></a> The use of an unusual form (<a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#36:3">Ezekiel  36:3</a>) is the only other authority.<a name=212:8></a> Bagster's Lexicon does not give this sense.<a name=212:9></a> However this may be, there is no doubt that the common use of the word elsewhere is "desolate," and that the other expressions are usually applied to Jerusalem.<a name=212:10></a> The consumption decreed is poured upon the desolate.<a name=212:11></a> Until then there will be a desolator.<a name=212:12></a> Thus we should have the declaration that he (the prince to come) confirms covenant with the many (the body of the Jews) one week; and in the midst of the week he will cause sacrifice and offering to cease; and because of the overspreading or protection of idols there will be a desolator, until the consumption decreed be poured on the desolate -- until God has filled up his judgment.<a name=212:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now a few words on the question of the desolate; chapter 11: 31.<a name=212:14></a> It is a different word, the abomination of desolation (<i>m'shomehm</i>) the word translated (chapter 9: 27) "he shall make it desolate" -- rather a desolator; they shall plant the abomination of the desolator.<a name=212:15></a> This seems admitted by the common authorities I have recourse to.<a name=212:16></a> It inclines me much to think that this passage refers much more distinctly to Antiochus than to the latter days (verse 32).<a name=212:17></a> "Do exploits" does not seem to me to characterise that epoch.<a name=212:18></a> As to chapter 8: 13, I leave this question, whether it is not the transgression of the desolate; when the transgressors are come to the full, transgressions against the daily sacrifice.<a name=212:19></a> It is clear in either case, that this causes desolation, so that I have nothing to oppose; but I would arrive at the force of the word.<a name=212:20></a> It is not, at any rate, an active desolator, I should think, in a positive way -- as <i>m'shomehm</i>.<a name=212:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The existence of the latter word in chapter 11: 31 makes chapter 12: 11 more interesting.<a name=213:1></a> There, and there alone, we have "<i>the abomination that desolates</i>" (Hebrews <i>shikkuts shomehm</i>); and to that, I apprehend, the Lord's solemn words specially refer as to the last days.<a name=213:2></a> I can hardly think that the Spirit uses in chapter 9: 27 the two words as He does to mean the same thing.<a name=213:3></a> If the difference in chapter 11: 31 and chapter 12: 11 be just, it throws vast light on the interpretation of the whole passage.<a name=213:4></a> Whatever may be the result as to the critical point, the connection of the two chapters of Isaiah (and others bear on it, particularly all from chapter 28 to the end of chapter 35) throws much light on the solemn scenes of the history of Israel and the world in the last days.<a name=213:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I just add here, that besides the evident division at the end of <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#6">Daniel  6</a>, between the historic scenes or dreams of others interpreted by Daniel, and the communications made to Daniel himself, there is a distinction to be made between chapters 7 and 8 (which have a common character) and chapter 9 to the end.<a name=213:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapters 7 and 8 are communications made to Daniel of certain events during the power of evil (the Jews being in no way delivered) and give us the two horns and their bearing on the history of those beloved of God, whatever their condition.<a name=213:7></a> But all this is seen as a picture, though a picture explained -- a picture of the power of evil.<a name=213:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the last four chapters, which date subsequent to the overthrow of Babylon, Daniel, according to the mind of God, is brought forward as intercessionally interested in Israel, and he pleads for guilty Israel, as Moses of old -- differently as to tone, but presenting, by faith in God's own thoughts, the people, as His people, whatever their state may have been (and that is the character of faith, while fully, for the very same reason, owning and confessing the sin).<a name=213:9></a> The result is remarkably analogous as to this.<a name=213:10></a> The angel who speaks on the Lord's behalf calls Israel Daniel's people, and the city his city, as the Lord did to Moses.<a name=213:11></a> Daniel sees no vision here of historical wonders, but of the person interested in Israel, who communicates to him Israel's history in reply to his faith in God and love to Israel, as the man greatly beloved.<a name=213:12></a> Chapter 9 seems to me to refer rather to chapter 7 and chapters 10, 11, and 12 to chapter 8; the former to the western, and the latter to

		ENQUIRY AS TO THE ANTICHRIST OF PROPHECY

		January, 1849.<a name=215:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My Dear Brother, <br>I beg to send you a series of remarks, which have gradually been assuming importance in my mind for now three or four years, though I still present them only in the shape of enquiry, and shall be glad and thankful to receive the communication of any remarks, or the suggestion of any difficulties (many having presented themselves to myself in the period I speak of).<a name=215:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All who look for a personal Antichrist have been accustomed to assume that he is the head of the Roman empire, in whose hand imperial power will be and the throne of the world.<a name=215:3></a> Of this I much doubt.<a name=215:4></a> I have no doubt there will be this blasphemous power, the object of universal admiration.<a name=215:5></a> The Scriptures seem to me to contain a plain revelation of this.<a name=215:6></a> The belief of it, therefore, remains of course unshaken in my mind.<a name=215:7></a> The question is, Is this power the Antichrist?<a name=215:8></a> The outline of the state of things, I would remark therefore, remains unaltered; and I am glad to add this, because it is important that, while open to correction on account of our imperfection, ascertained truth should maintain its weight and authority: as a moral state of the soul this is important.<a name=215:9></a> I have often seen "the putting always everything in question" presented as sincerity and the love of truth.<a name=215:10></a> Whereas it is merely the haughtiest pretension of the human mind, which would hold its unshackled despotism to displace everything at pleasure, and make its own thoughts creatures of its will; while love of truth is seen in holding and being subject to known truth, in which we are taught of God, and, as subject to it, not departing from it.<a name=215:11></a> But, of course, even where known, we may be imperfect in our apprehension of it.<a name=215:12></a> I repeat, then, I see nothing to change in general, though doubtless much to learn, in the belief of this blasphemous imperial power which will act under or have the throne of Satan in the last days.<a name=215:13></a> The question with me is, if the saints have not lost sight of another power, of which the Scriptures speak more even than of the great public blasphemous government; and that the consideration of this power is necessary to the filling up of the scene according

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I proceed to consider the passages, and present the thoughts which have occurred to me.<a name=216:3></a> Antichrist is not spoken of nominally, that I am aware of, elsewhere than in the epistle of John.<a name=216:4></a> There, it is needless to say, his character is wholly religious -- an heretical and apostate activity against the person and glory of Christ and the essential doctrines of truth as connected with Him, and of which Christianity is formed.<a name=216:5></a> "They went out from us," thus manifested "that they were not all of us.<a name=216:6></a>" The apostle then directed the attention of the younger saints who had heard that there would be an Antichrist to this, as giving his character and marking the last times.<a name=216:7></a> Further, he denies the Father and the Son -- the revelation proper to and constituting Christianity.<a name=216:8></a> He does not confess Jesus Christ come in flesh -- the other great cardinal basis of the truth.<a name=216:9></a> We may add, not as in contrast with Christianity, but as generally characteristic, "Who is a liar but he that denies that Jesus is the Christ?<a name=216:10></a>" This would be the first point to which godly Jews would be brought, without speaking of the doctrines of Christianity.<a name=216:11></a> When this was really owned, a man could be recognised as born of God.<a name=216:12></a> When the Christ formed the subject of religious belief and expectation, to own Jesus to be it implied a proper work of God.<a name=216:13></a> An apostate and heretical character is given then as the mark of Antichrist, and, further, as of Satan ("who is a liar?<a name=216:14></a>").<a name=216:15></a> He does not own (which seems to me more Jewish connection and evil) Jesus to be the Christ.<a name=216:16></a> <i>Who</i> was the Christ, not what He was, is the subject of interest, and that is an answer to Jewish expectation, and the test of Jewish incredulity -- ("If ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins"), and he who is a liar denies that the blessed Jesus is.<a name=216:17></a> It is evident that the presenting Himself as the Son made the Jews reject Him as the Christ, because thus they were, man was, morally put to the test; and it must have been so to be according to truth, and also in order not to present an object to human passions in a religious form, but the truth and glory and Son of God -- God himself morally, and the manifestations of the Father in grace to the heart and conscience of men.<a name=216:18></a> (See <a href="../bible/John.htm#8:14">John  8:14</a>-24).<a name=216:19></a> Still the two things are distinct, though impossible to separate, as both are united in His Person.<a name=216:20></a>

		I may add here that the translation, "this is that [spirit] of Antichrist," is hardly warranted, that is, the insertion of the word "spirit," but I do not feel need to say more.<a name=217:1></a> In general, it is evident that what the Spirit of God designates as characterising this Antichrist are religious qualities or energies of evil.<a name=217:2></a> He is occupied with religious subjects, and characterised by that occupation, and in connection with Christianity and Judaism.<a name=217:3></a> This is not, perhaps, all his character; but it is characteristic: this is the "<i>of the Antichrist</i>.<a name=217:4></a>" This is evidently of great importance.<a name=217:5></a> There is an energising spirit of this character.<a name=217:6></a>

		We have then the fact as to the history of the latter day, that there are two beasts or manifestations of power united in their operations, but at the same time very distinct; each of them amazingly important in the place it holds, though one be distinctively on the throne of the prince of this world, the other not.<a name=217:7></a> Whatever title they may hold, those are the two.<a name=217:8></a> I speak of this, because, in some passages, and in our minds in reflecting on the spirit of the age, the general character may be presented, and we readily forget that there are certainly historically two vessels of evil power: one having the public authority and a certain character; the other, in whom is the energy which acts and produces the effect on men, in subservience to the throne and public power.<a name=217:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I shall consider first this second beast in whom the energy of seduction is found.<a name=217:10></a> It will hardly be questioned that the Antichrist, whatever system of interpretation is adopted, is found in one or other of these two vessels of evil power.<a name=217:11></a> First, then, the second is a beast.<a name=217:12></a> That is, there is an analogy in the nature of their existence.<a name=217:13></a> Now beasts are a well known figure; and I am not aware of any case in which they are not a temporal power; so that we have here a temporal power subsisting along with the great general power who had Satan's throne.<a name=217:14></a> This is nothing surprising, as we know horns or kings will so subsist who give their power to the beast.<a name=217:15></a> This is different, it is true, but it is a temporal power.<a name=217:16></a> It had two horns lamb-like.<a name=217:17></a> The Lamb is not Christianity but Christ.<a name=217:18></a> This beast, then (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#13">Revelation  13</a>) in the form of its power resembled Christ, but its language was the full character and pretension of Satan, its speech dragon-like.<a name=217:19></a> This is evidently a remarkable character, a form of power like Christ, a language like Satan, not in deceit merely but in public pretension.<a name=217:20></a> It is not as a

		We shall see another character of this power in a moment; but I confine myself to this passage now.<a name=218:6></a> The character of the display of this power is frightful.<a name=218:7></a> What the prophets of Baal could not do, and what Elias did, as a contrasting proof that Jehovah alone was the true God, this beast does, at least in the eyes of men, besides other great signs.<a name=218:8></a> He seduces and deceives the inhabitants of the earth through the signs he was given to do before the beast.<a name=218:9></a> The beast would be content enough to have such an energy to sustain and support his throne, and exalt and adorn his authority in the eyes of men -- authority which rested only in deceit and delusion of mind, or persecution.<a name=218:10></a> This seducing prophet and power leads them on to idolatry also, and gives breath to the image of the beast, so as to speak and have those killed who did not worship it.<a name=218:11></a> Thus, while sustaining the throne of Satan in the world, this second beast, while Satanic in his language, speaking like the dragon, has the form of royalty and prophecy established by signs, and such signs to the eyes of men as had erst sufficed to establish Jehovah's sole name and authority in the mind of Israel, to the destruction of an incapable Baal.<a name=218:12></a> The aim, however, of all is the recognition of Satan's authority in him whom he has placed on his throne; but the energy which produces the effect on the minds of men is in the second beast.<a name=218:13></a> While exercising power and bearing its form (a beast with horns), still religious seduction, and properly such as connects itself with ancient Jehovah-testimony, is what characterises this second beast: he is spoken of in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#19">Revelation  19</a>as the false prophet.<a name=218:14></a>

		I would now turn to another passage, where the last form of evil is spoken of, and see what is its character there; <a href="../bible/2Thessalonians.htm#2">2 Thessalonians  2</a>.<a name=219:12></a> Here we can hardly doubt, on reading verse 9, that there is a connection with the false prophet.<a name=219:13></a> But the question may arise, if it is not merely to characterise the time and reign of the beast, or if "whose coming" means that he himself is known by these signs.<a name=219:14></a> That is, is it generally characteristic, the first beast or the second?<a name=219:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I think I see, then, in verses 3, 4, the moral character of this wicked power acting upon others, and shewing the energy of his will in hostility, and setting aside of God, rather than the object of deference or honour on the throne.<a name=220:6></a> He is what fills the scene morally when the apostasy takes place -- the active energy which works in man.<a name=220:7></a> It is the man of sin -- man against God, and pretending to be, or shewing himself as though he were God upon earth: the contrast of Christ, who was so, but was the man of obedience, righteousness, and humiliation, submitting to everything when it was not disobedience to God His Father.<a name=220:8></a> The man of sin was a thing to be revealed.<a name=220:9></a> Meanwhile a certain mystery of iniquity was at work -- the principles of lawlessness -- of the independence of man, and the acting of his will, but in mystery only.<a name=220:10></a> There was a restrainer until He should be taken out of the way, and then the lawless one would be revealed.<a name=220:11></a> But if he was the lawless self-exaltation of man's will, that was not all.<a name=220:12></a> His presence or coming was according to the energy of Satan; and if we have found in the second beast the terrible analogy with the case of Elias, but in deception, here we have perhaps the yet more frightful one with Christ.<a name=220:13></a> The terms by which are expressed what he does in falsehood are the same as those by which, in the Acts, Christ has been shewn a man approved of God (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:22">Acts  2:22</a>); and as Christ was in truth of righteousness to such as should be saved, so he in deceit of unrighteousness to those who were given up to be lost, <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#2:15">2 Corinthians  2:15</a>.<a name=220:14></a> The true Christ will come from heaven, a heavenly Man: this an earthly man, with all the pretensions which could belong to, and the proofs, to those given up to judgment, which would demonstrate his title to glory, but in an

		I now turn to another passage where we have a power clearly distinguished from the beast, and which nevertheless stamps it with his character, and is, at the same time, peculiarly connected at the end with the Jewish people, though hating what was heavenly.<a name=222:6></a> I refer to <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#7">Daniel  7</a>, where a distinct horn rises after all the others, different from them, subduing three -- a horn always as such distinct from the beast, but which brings judgment on it, and whose actings at the end make it morally the grand affair.<a name=222:7></a> Here we have many characteristics of the first beast's actings, attributed to him in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#13">Revelation  13</a>.<a name=222:8></a> We see the horn to be the active agent here, for the horn is looked at as part of the beast here, his generally secular or Gentile totality being the point of view in which it is considered.<a name=222:9></a> Still the little horn is evidently a distinct agent.<a name=222:10></a> If it be thought that the horn is really, though locally only, possessing the territory of three, the virtual head of the whole empire as a chief, besides his own territory, and hence that he would correspond rather to the first beast of <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#13">Revelation  13</a>where the general character of the beast itself only is given, I should have nothing that I am aware of to object.<a name=222:11></a> The other point would remain untouched.<a name=222:12></a> The moral points of union are evident: the two beasts play into each other's hands; one, as we have seen, holding the public authority and throne, the other exercising the energy of Satan.<a name=222:13></a> It had even occurred to me that <a href="../bible/2Thessalonians.htm#2:3">2 Thessalonians  2:3</a>, 4, and 8, might distinctively denote them; but I pursue the study of the passage.<a name=222:14></a> This horn had the intelligence and foresight of thought and purpose, which was more than power and conquest, design and consideration, place and haughty pretensions avowed: he brings judgment on the beast.<a name=222:15></a> Three things are attributed to him: "speaking great words against the Most High" (this is more than the Ancient of days; it is the supremacy of God as above all); he wears out the saints of the high places; and he thinks to change times and laws (Jewish order and ordinances) and they are delivered into his hand.<a name=222:16></a> So that we find atheistical

		Though the thoughts I send you be very brief, I do not hesitate to communicate them, as I judge they aid in the estimate of one of the principal objects which fill the scene in the last days.<a name=225:1></a> And I apprehend that it is not merely in the arrangement of a complete system (for which our knowledge is often too imperfect) that we make progress in the mind of God on this, or indeed on any subject in Scripture, but quite as much in any light which gives a more distinct and definite character to any of the elements which compose the whole, if indeed we can say that prophetic subjects are revealed as a whole.<a name=225:2></a> Our sphere of vision, our capacity of embracing the entire scene as God does, necessitates in His communication of the truth the presenting of the parts which compose it: and it is in the attempt to combine them that we often find the greatest difficulty.<a name=225:3></a> That they do combine we cannot doubt, and that the points of combination exist since each part is perfect; but the combination itself not being always given, we have to wait much and patiently upon divine enlargement of view to be able to do it justly.<a name=225:4></a> The geographer can easily put together the dissected map, but the child (and we are children) must learn the geography in a slower process of putting it together.<a name=225:5></a> I suspect we have made them less, while some elements are very certain, than we are disposed to think.<a name=225:6></a> But every progress in distinct knowledge of the elements facilitates the apprehension of the whole.<a name=225:7></a>

		I proceed to notice two characteristics of the evil power in the latter days which may aid in this -- very simple, but which have much struck me.<a name=225:8></a> One has been noticed some years back.<a name=225:9></a> In <a href="../bible/2Thessalonians.htm#2:9">2 Thessalonians  2:9</a> we have the statement that the presence of the wicked [one] will be with all power, and signs, and lying wonders; that is, "in all power and signs and wonders of falsehood.<a name=225:10></a>" If we compare this with <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:22">Acts  2:22</a>, we find that the blessed Lord is described as a man approved of God, i.<a name=225:11></a>e.<a name=225:12></a>, proved to be of Him, His mission and truth proved by miracles (powers), wonders, and signs.<a name=225:13></a> That is, we have three things which were proofs of the truth and mission of the Lord Jesus, attesting to the eyes of men the title of the wicked one: in this case, <i>falsehood</i> is of course added, "lying" or of falsehood; but this does not, as to the terribleness of the case or its character, alter it, because men are given up then to

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#21">Luke  21</a>it is much more historical, because it opens out, as revealing the Son of man, the period in which Israel is set aside and not counted in its history, or what concerns the Gentiles.<a name=230:5></a> Hence the Spirit records no enquiry of "the sign of thy coming and of the end of the age," but the general history in connection with the destruction of Jerusalem.<a name=230:6></a> Thus, from verse 9 to verse 19 inclusive we have the state of things from after the Lord's death until the encircling of Jerusalem by the Roman armies, and no mention made of the abomination of desolation, and verse 20 gives the reply to the question of verse 7, founded on verse 6.<a name=230:7></a> The statement accordingly says nothing of the tribulation such as never was; but that vengeance then comes on the people and city, that all may be accomplished.<a name=230:8></a> This still continues and will continue, Jerusalem being trodden down, till the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled, in the close of the Gentile dominion begun in Nebuchadnezzar.<a name=230:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the fact is revealed of the state of things at the close of the dominion of Gentile power -- signs in sun, moon, and stars; on earth, distress of nations with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring (the last expression shewing, I think, that the words are employed figuratively, though there may be possibly portents also); men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth; for the powers of heaven (the sources of the earthly state of things) shall be shaken.<a name=230:10></a> And then shall they

		Such is the prophetical revelation which presents, it seems to me, little difficulty.<a name=231:2></a> The exhortation which follows may suggest more; at the same time, it offers some remarkable helps as to the use of expressions.<a name=231:3></a> For example, "this generation shall not pass away till all be fulfilled" (verse 32) proves, necessarily, either that "generation" must be taken in an extended sense, as in <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#32:5">Deuteronomy  32:5</a>, 20, and as in other passages; or, that "all" could only apply to the establishment of the state of things at the setting aside judicially of the Jewish people, because we have the treading down of Jerusalem for a long continuous period revealed.<a name=231:4></a> Hence we have to seek the guidance of the Spirit for the application of the passage, there being an incipient accomplishment at the destruction or treading down of Jerusalem, its desolation, vengeance, etc.<a name=231:5></a>, which subsists still, and a far fuller one at the close preceding the coming of the Son of man.<a name=231:6></a> Hence the Holy Ghost records here an expression which may apply to both: "Know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand.<a name=231:7></a>" I do not doubt that this had a certain accomplishment in the absolute suppression of the Jewish order, but no fulfilment; and that the kingdom of God will be established by the coming of the Son of man after the signs of verses 25, 26.<a name=231:8></a> Note also that this passage precludes the possibility of the application of "the coming of the Son of man" to the destruction of Jerusalem, because we have already had the long treading down, consequent on the encompassing with armies.<a name=231:9></a> The full natural application of verses 28-31, then, is to the close when, these signs having taken place, the full deliverance of the Jewish faithful will take place.<a name=231:10></a> So verse 35 has a limited application to Judea or Palestine; but it is evident to me that there is the larger application of the coming of the day of the Lord on the whole earth.<a name=231:11></a> It is the day that is spoken of.<a name=231:12></a> Verse 36 seems to me also to refer absolutely to the character of a Jewish remnant (though in a still better sense it will be true of the church);

		OUTLINE OF THE REVELATION
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is important to remark, first of all, that the Revelation is a book of judgment -- judgment on the earth (in the interval between the church and an owned state on earth, the secret springs being shewn in heaven, where alone the earthly acts could be understood) first, of the professing church as a system on the earth, where it is responsible to maintain the truth and testimony of God, and then, of the world.<a name=233:1></a> In the latter case, the church is no longer at all in question.<a name=233:2></a> The only places in which the church is seen in its Christian affections and position is in the beginning and at the end of the book, before the subject of it is opened and after it is closed.<a name=233:3></a> In the first case it is seen in its members, in the last as a whole (I refer to chapter 1: 6 and chapter 22:17).<a name=233:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Further, it is important to remark, that the character in which Christ reveals Himself in the opening of the book, is wholly earthly -- heaven is excluded.<a name=233:5></a> He is the faithful Witness, the First-begotten from the dead, and the Prince of the kings of the earth.<a name=233:6></a> The church knows Him in all these characters, and is associated with the last two.<a name=233:7></a> She ought to have replaced the first; but she is never seen here in that position.<a name=233:8></a> John does not even set himself on the ground of the church's witness and heavenly place; he is in the tribulation, kingdom, and patient expectation of Christ.<a name=233:9></a> The first time the church is addressed, it is with warnings and threatenings, as being already fallen.<a name=233:10></a> If seen in her own character, it is only to look for Jesus.<a name=233:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ judges divinely, though as Son of man (a name of judgment and government), also in the midst of the church seen on earth and responsible to bear light there.<a name=233:12></a> He is eternal, searching in judgment and consuming, in firmness of power, having in His own hand the symbolical representatives of the churches or states of the professing church which He addresses.<a name=233:13></a> The word of sharp judgment proceeded out of His mouth.<a name=233:14></a> Sovereign authority shone in His visage.<a name=233:15></a> However, He had the power of life (and that out of death) to him that bowed to Him; and John therefore was to write what he saw -- not merely to be confounded by it, but to make known this character of judgment to the churches -- "the things that are" (for that was now the real relationship of Christ to the body here below, standing in the position of testimony) and "the things that were to happen after them"; for only after these

		Christ and the church would take their place in manifestation of glory and testimony.<a name=234:1></a> Hence the rapture of the church, unless it be in mystery, is not known here, because this is testimony on the earth or that which governs the earth both secretly and publicly (and so judgments there); and the church's taking up to heaven forms no part of this.<a name=234:2></a> That is its portion in its own relationship to Christ of privilege and affection.<a name=234:3></a> We see testimony looked for in its earthly state at the beginning, and what is needed for its public manifestation at the end.<a name=234:4></a> In the first it had already failed; but the second (blessed be God!<a name=234:5></a>) cannot; for it is accomplished by divine power.<a name=234:6></a> The former first presents itself, there is no promise of inward grace, no supply of strength.<a name=234:7></a> Motives, promises, encouragements, warnings, threatenings, and judgments announced .<a name=234:8></a>.<a name=234:9></a>.<a name=234:10></a> all these the Son of man holds out; but never an inward supply of grace, never one word such as "my grace is sufficient for thee," "my strength is made perfect in weakness.<a name=234:11></a>" He was dealing with the responsibility of the church as a profession in the earth -- as a position to be maintained, not in His affection for His beloved saints, nor for His bride the church.<a name=234:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This, it is evident, gives a very important character to these addresses and is easily verified by the reader; we are on earth with a Judge, not in heaven, nor in communion with a Saviour.<a name=234:13></a> It is not a mere judge -- that is for the world -- but One who rebukes and chastens because He loves (still that is in a certain sense judicial) -- One who is patient, gracious, pains-taking, vigilant to warn and shew the failure, and the path to follow, the sentiments that become the state of those He addresses Himself to; but who can spue out of His mouth that which, after all the pains taken, does not answer what He has a right to and must expect and require.<a name=234:14></a> This is not the church of His elect, though they may be there.<a name=234:15></a> It is the body which has a public responsibility to maintain its testimony in the earth.<a name=234:16></a> The churches then present Christ's judgment on, and dealings with, the professing body, or at least those who have ears to hear when their first decay attracts His vigilant and bounden care, till they are utterly rejected as a witness on the earth: patient but judicial in its character, and failing in no one warning which, if listened to, might have led to the avoidance of the judgment, and adding every promise which could encourage and sustain faith.<a name=234:17></a> It is not the Spirit in the church acting

		To the world, as we shall see, all is simple judgment; till the time of glory, graduated judgment, but only judgment, though a remnant may be preserved through it.<a name=235:2></a> What we have previously enlarged upon constitutes "the things that are" -- the characteristic state of the church, with Christ's judgment upon it while it continues a public -- the public -- witness on Christ's behalf in the world.<a name=235:3></a> Various and even contemporaneous elements may enter into this; but together they prove the judicial history of what the church has been as a professing witness from beginning to end.<a name=235:4></a> I may perhaps enter into some details further on.<a name=235:5></a> These "things which are" close, however: God no longer recognises the professing church as a public witness, even a blamable one.<a name=235:6></a> The moment is not stated nor the manner.<a name=235:7></a> He ceases to speak (for His words are the warning of, not the execution of, judgment), when He said, "I am about to spue thee out of my mouth.<a name=235:8></a>" It may continue to the eyes of man, when, every saint of the true church being gone, it is no longer in any way the object of Christ's care, even judicial, and may be left to Satan to make any use he pleases of it.<a name=235:9></a> Perhaps some awhile drag on in self-delusion their association with its existence.<a name=235:10></a> I say this, not to lead to speculation on what may be, but to arrest conclusions as to what is not, that is, the accomplishment of the act of cutting off.<a name=235:11></a> There is no candlestick which God owns, nor light at all.<a name=235:12></a> The carcase may be there which hindered and corrupted; the soul is fled.<a name=235:13></a>

		Satan from heaven, where he shall no longer be the adversary of the saints, introduces the last three years and a half, the peculiar character of which is his power, and working, and rage upon earth in consequence.<a name=247:1></a> Not merely the saints of the church long since out of view, but the saints in conflict in the immediately preceding epoch are out of his reach.<a name=247:2></a> They have overcome, suffered, and their victory is celebrated; but if God had not shortened the days, no flesh would be saved of those subject to his violence on earth.<a name=247:3></a> The woman (the Jews as objects of God's purpose) and her seed are the great object of his malice; but the woman is secured, and he makes war with the remnant of her seed, characterised as having the commandments of God and the testimony of Jesus (that is, as being faithful in obedience, of which the commandment of God, the law, was the measure, and walking by the light and spirit of prophecy); for the spirit of prophecy is the testimony of Jesus.<a name=247:4></a>

		Satan's plans in that terrible time are then unfolded; a beast rises, as to its providential existence, out of the mass and confusion of the nations; its form was that of ten kingdoms, distinct governments, yet a corporate body which had had itself seven forms of government, and embraced the qualities of power of all the previous empires, and to which Satan gives his throne and power.<a name=247:5></a> He blasphemes against God, his tabernacle (I suppose his heavenly one in the church), and against those that dwell in heaven.<a name=247:6></a> It is an essentially earthly beast exalting man and what is seen, and filled with hatred of all that was above him and that was heaven.<a name=247:7></a> Save the elect, he has empire given him; and those who have their portion on earth worship him.<a name=247:8></a> He had one of his forms of existence wounded to death, but this was healed; it was a Satanic imperial power and body, formed however of the union of several kingdoms.<a name=247:9></a> But there was yet another instrument of the enemy's; if he set up the first beast on the throne in power as an object, he wrought in another as an agent.<a name=247:10></a> The second beast arises out of the earth.<a name=247:11></a> It is in the already formed and ordered system.<a name=247:12></a> He is a power, and the form of his power is Christ's (not Christianity but Christ's); but his voice was Satan's.<a name=247:13></a> He does ample signs also to prove himself the prophet sent of God, doing that which Elijah did as the test between Jehovah and Baal.<a name=247:14></a> He has the claims in form of Christ's royalty, and works peculiar signs as a prophet; but all this in the service of the beast, all whose

		Next, we have God's workings in the midst of all this.<a name=248:6></a> First, the faithful remnant of Judah, who have known how to suffer like the Lamb during the power of him who had His appearance.<a name=248:7></a> It is not yet Solomon glory, but David on Zion between Shiloh and the temple, as in Chronicles, and those who have suffered with him there.<a name=248:8></a> Hence they have not their name, as children, but His Father's name who had been faithful to Him in His life, so suffering; and counted on His name in their measure, as Christ had.<a name=248:9></a> These were not in heaven, but associated as an anticipative remnant with all Christ's glory when He takes it, like David's worthies, not entering into it when it is taken, but with Him into it in its fullest display on earth, with Him the Lamb in His earthly royal state wherever He goes; and this being sovereign grace, they can catch the heavenly air they are so near to, though they are not in heaven.<a name=248:10></a> These first secured in their place as ever, the gospel of God's creation-glory and swift-coming judgment is sent forth -- a last message, that man may escape, as <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#96">Psalm  96</a>.<a name=248:11></a> Then the fall of Babylon is announced; then the final solemn warning against the beast: and then it is announced that it is closed, and the dying in the Lord are thenceforth happy.<a name=248:12></a> None are now to be thus put to death, for all is now turned.<a name=248:13></a> And the harvest or distinctive judgment, where the good are spared, and the vintage, where it is all destruction of the apostate Judaism, take place.<a name=248:14></a> Much of this last may have even had the form of Christianity (for aught I know it is probable); but it is now idolatrous apostate Judaism.<a name=248:15></a>

		The next step is the binding of Satan in the bottomless pit; this closes all that part of judgment.<a name=251:4></a> Verse 4 begins that of another character, and not following the order of time -- the judgment of the throne, not as making war, but as ruling.<a name=251:5></a> In principle this continues till the great white throne has pronounced its fiat.<a name=251:6></a> But here on these millennial thrones the saints are associated.<a name=251:7></a> It is not precisely here the royal priests surrounding the throne, and worshipping, but thrones of judgment, such as <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#7">Daniel  7</a>alludes to.<a name=251:8></a> We have, in general, the thrones; and as it might have been supposed that the beheaded, whom we have seen under the altar, and the persecuted of the beast, had lost their share, they are specifically named as found alive, though the body might have been killed; and they live and reign with Christ.<a name=251:9></a> Satan is let loose, that the inhabitants of the millennial earth may be put to the test, and alas!<a name=251:10></a> found to be men; and then the close in Christ's final judgment of the dead, and all things new.<a name=251:11></a>

		From verse 9 (chapter 21), we have the connection of the heavenly Jerusalem with the earth during the millennium, including its own blessedness from which the blessing flowed; and the book is closed by warnings of Christ's coming to those concerned in the prophecy, "to every man," and then by the revelation of Himself to the church, which awakens her desire that He come, with her possession of the living water of grace meanwhile; to which He answers with the assurance, that He comes quickly, and the prophet adds his "Amen.<a name=251:12></a>"

		REMARKS ON THE SEVEN CHURCHES
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have a few remarks to make on the churches.<a name=252:1></a> The object in view being their judgment, it is not the power which produced blessing that is presented to us; but the state in which the church is found when the blessing produced has been left in men's hands, as an effect -- the state after the spiritual energy has been at work.<a name=252:2></a> Another thing it is well to remember -- that a previously described state does not necessarily cease to exist because a new one is introduced.<a name=252:3></a> The church has lost its first love, though much else has come in since.<a name=252:4></a> Jezebel has not ceased to exercise her pernicious influence because Sardis has a name to live and is dead.<a name=252:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next thing I would remark is, that when judgment is to happen to one of the churches (and so is pronounced on the state which that church represents), in the execution of it, the saints, where they are distinguished, are necessarily to be considered apart from the threatened evil-doers, and the time of the punishment of the latter is not in the period pointed out in the address to the church as such.<a name=252:6></a> These remain for the execution of the judgment after the encouraged saints are gone, and may be a carcase carrying its former name, but a mere carcase with no life at all.<a name=252:7></a> Thus, in Thyatira certain are reserved for great tribulation, and certain to be killed by the retributive justice of God; but under what circumstances is not stated.<a name=252:8></a> The saints will be gone before the execution of this judgment: so that it is not in the mixed body to which the Lord's given judgment applies.<a name=252:9></a> This modifies extremely the historical accomplishment of the results spoken of in the threatenings pronounced.<a name=252:10></a> This remark, however, I think, does not properly apply to the first three churches: their corporate state is recognised, not as being what it ought to be perhaps, but as existing -- as a recognised corporate object.<a name=252:11></a> Hence the church, as such, is threatened with the Lord's visitation, and "he that overcometh" is placed after the "he that hath ears.<a name=252:12></a>" But in Thyatira the faithful are distinguished as "the rest in Thyatira.<a name=252:13></a>" The church, as a professing body, had lost its corporate witness.<a name=252:14></a> Hence the Lord's coming is now put forward as a hope and time of expectation to the faithful, to whom the church was no longer a stay and consolation;
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=253>[Page 253]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and the saints are particularly referred to that.<a name=253:1></a> "Hold fast till I come.<a name=253:2></a>" This is very remarkable, as giving now a hope and stay out of the church to the faithful.<a name=253:3></a> The change of "the overcomer" to a place before the warning to hear (that is the comparative individualisation of the latter) accompanies this also, beginning with the church of Thyatira.<a name=253:4></a> With Thyatira closes also the application of the characters of Christ found in the things John had seen.<a name=253:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Sardis, the title of Christ in the church, as holding the seven stars in His right hand, is recognised -- that could not be questioned.<a name=253:6></a> But after this all the titles are new, to be understood by a distinctive faith, which is the stay and gives its character to the fidelity of the saints who know His name, but which was not what John had seen displayed of Christ as in the midst of the churches.<a name=253:7></a> Sardis and Philadelphia both participate in the announcement of the Lord's coming; which, when the church was thoroughly corrupted as at Thyatira, so that the residue were distinguished from the body, is held out to sustain the faith, and relieve the spirit of those oppressed by the evil.<a name=253:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But then in Sardis the coming is presented in a very different way, from what it is in Philadelphia.<a name=253:9></a> Sardis, whose reputation was great, but who was dead in relation with Him who had all the perfections of the Spirit, has her works judged as not perfect before God; and she is threatened with the world's judgment.<a name=253:10></a> (Compare <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#4">1 Thessalonians  4</a>; <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#21:35">Luke  21:35</a>.<a name=253:11></a>) Here we have again to remark, that the judgment of Sardis will be, when all real pretension to be a church had ceased, if even the form be preserved.<a name=253:12></a> The few worthy will be in white with Jesus; and, after their taking away, those who had formed part of the body will be judged with the world.<a name=253:13></a> In what form they subsist is not said: only we may in general say that it will be as unfaithful in the place they stood in, not as not being in it.<a name=253:14></a> (See <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#24:50">Matthew  24:50</a>, 51, and chapter 25: 30.<a name=253:15></a>) In Philadelphia, the church is become a remnant, and the remnant is the church in God's sight.<a name=253:16></a> All is encouragement: and though strength be very little, still an open door is there.<a name=253:17></a> They will be kept from the hour of temptation which will come on the world; and they are comforted with the assurance that the Lord is coming quickly.<a name=253:18></a> It is to them, as waiting for Him, a comfort and a joy.<a name=253:19></a> It is the faithful, the feeble awakened remnant at the close, who, entering into the patience of Christ,
	</div>

		<a name=254>[Page 254]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		are comforted by the assurance of their entire separation from the world's lot, not merely in judgment, but in the terrible tribulation coming.<a name=254:1></a> They would be entirely out of the time even in which it would be.<a name=254:2></a> But Christ is not yet come.<a name=254:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the Laodicean church, Christ alone takes the character of "Amen" to promise, and "faithful and true" -- promise, and the name in which He is to be Head of all things new, soon to be manifested, "the beginning of the creation of God.<a name=254:4></a>" (Compare His own titles, <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1">Colossians  1</a>.<a name=254:5></a>) The church has lost the sense of what Christ is and hence has a good opinion of her own state.<a name=254:6></a> And here again the principle previously spoken of applies.<a name=254:7></a> The execution of judgment on the persons guilty does not come within the limits of the real existence of that addressed as "the church.<a name=254:8></a>" I say this of Laodicea; and it is here the question becomes really important, because the Lord addresses it yet as "church.<a name=254:9></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The overcomers have yet a place at least in the throne with Christ.<a name=254:10></a> The body had, when addressed, yet the name of a place before God, and was judged by Him as such; but its real state was nauseous to God, and it would be spued out of the Lord's mouth, utterly rejected as such.<a name=254:11></a> This is rather its rejection as in a church-standing than the execution of judgment on those guilty.<a name=254:12></a> And this was, in the knowledge of God, its certain portion.<a name=254:13></a> Still counsel and warning were addressed to it, till its rejection took place.<a name=254:14></a> But the Lord distinguishes the possible remnant that may still linger within, in the patience of His mercy (always unwearied while mercy is possible).<a name=254:15></a> But I judge that it is not the resulting judgment on those who refuse the warning and are cast out, but the entire rejection, as disgusting to Christ, from the position in which they stood as a body.<a name=254:16></a> A faithful witness could no longer bear such a thing.<a name=254:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This supposes, that after the Sardis state is formed, a Philadelphian body arises, through grace, which is to escape the time of tribulation.<a name=254:18></a> The forming of this body, I apprehend, induces a result -- the Laodicean state of the public body, which is what Christ will reject, as having to do with the church, leaving aside the judgment of the guilty after their works.<a name=254:19></a> The historical execution of the threatening is not given, any more than the rapture of the faithful, because the message is addressed to the body while it has, as a present thing, the character in which it is addressed, with the consequences of certain conduct: only here the declaration of rejection is

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before entering into the detail of the addresses to the seven churches, of which it is my purpose to speak, it would be well to say a few words as to the general character of the book in which they are found.<a name=256:1></a> It is exceedingly important that we should get a right and distinct apprehension of certain great principles which run through the whole book of Revelation, or we shall not understand what God is spoken of in it as doing.<a name=256:2></a> And here, remember that it is from Scripture alone that we gather what the purpose of God is, and what God is about in doing <i>what</i> He does, and in doing it <i>as</i> He does.<a name=256:3></a>

		The first chapter introduces the whole book.<a name=256:4></a> It is a revelation given to Jesus Christ to shew unto His <i>servants</i> things which must come to pass preparatory to the appearing of Christ.<a name=256:5></a> It is a wonderful thought that God should make such communications, as is also the way in which He does it.<a name=256:6></a> For God cannot write as man does, merely to recount what interests or affects the passions of men.<a name=256:7></a> But when God writes, it is in order to bring out something by which to test our souls, and bring them into fellowship with Himself.<a name=256:8></a> Take the gospels for instance.<a name=256:9></a> They are not written merely to give an historical account of Christ when down here, but to unfold to our souls God's purposes and ways of grace, in the work and Person of His Son.<a name=256:10></a> And it is only as we thus learn what God's thoughts and ways are, that we are able to understand what God is doing in any part of His ways.<a name=256:11></a>

		The book of Revelation is a book of judgment all through.<a name=256:12></a> God is revealed in the book, as one about to execute judgment.<a name=256:13></a> This applies to the church itself, as seen in chapters 2 and 3.<a name=256:14></a> It is seen on the earth -- subject to judgment.<a name=256:15></a> The prophecy may speak of the things which are under judgment, and of the means by which judgment may be averted; but still it is all

		Then, again, we do not find the name of Father in this book in connection with the saints.<a name=257:4></a> The Father is spoken of in connection with Christ (chapter 2: 27; chapter 3: 5, 21), but this only confirms the remark in the text.<a name=257:5></a> It is used also in chapter 14: 1, where the name of the <i>Lamb's</i> Father is written on the foreheads of the hundred and forty-four thousand, and even then it is His Father, though His name be on their foreheads; neither is there the relationship of the bride, the Lamb's wife, until the marriage of the Lamb is spoken of as taking place.<a name=257:6></a> The system and relationships in the book of Revelation are of another character altogether.<a name=257:7></a> It is God dealing with what is on the earth, according to the responsibility.<a name=257:8></a> This simple thought prevents very many mistakes.<a name=257:9></a> And further, it is not only judicial in its character, but judgment connected with the earth -- that is, that men are responsible upon earth for that which is committed to their trust.<a name=257:10></a> So that, if even the church is spoken of in this book as being on the earth, its responsibility is the subject spoken of, and as such it comes under judgment.<a name=257:11></a> Thus you get the earth as its subject.<a name=257:12></a>

		The next important remark is, that the whole character of the book is prophetic.<a name=257:13></a> "Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear, the words of this prophecy.<a name=257:14></a>" And even when the seven churches are addressed, the language is prophetic.<a name=257:15></a> It is not so in the various epistles in the previous part of the New Testament.<a name=257:16></a> They are communications addressed to the churches or saints, directing their present conduct in the relationship in which God in grace had set them with Himself and the Lord Christ.<a name=257:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I say these addresses are prophetic; that is, they are the announcement of results and consequences which would come upon those to whom they apply, as forming a public body, in the way of judgment -- not the ministration of grace and direction in a sure and subsisting relationship as to which no change is suffered.<a name=257:18></a> It is not a present blessing intended for the speaker, and those who would receive it at the time as having ears to hear.<a name=257:19></a> We see this same difference in the Old Testament

It may be that at the time the Apocalypse was written, the eldest or most eminent among the elders had a kind of precedence; but if it were even so in fact so as to render him responsible, the fact that he is called angel here is a proof, that if the responsibility was maintained, no such ecclesiastical title would be owned in Scripture by the Lord.

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is important to distinguish between the view of the church of God as a responsible body on the earth, and therefore subject to judgment, and that view of it which looks at it as the body of Christ, and as enjoying her proper place before God, and her privileges as such.<a name=273:2></a> We must keep these two truths distinctly and definitely before our minds, or we shall get into confusion.<a name=273:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We saw the last time, that God has given Christ to be "Head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.<a name=273:4></a>" God's thought and purpose about the church is, that it should be the body of Christ when He takes dominion over all things.<a name=273:5></a> God has exalted Christ far above all principality and power and might and dominion, and has put all things under His feet, and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church, which is His body, and, therefore, called "the fulness of him that filleth all in all.<a name=273:6></a>" All the fulness of the Godhead dwelt in Christ; but this is quite another thing.<a name=273:7></a> We are His fulness, that is, we complete the mystic man, Christ being the Head.<a name=273:8></a> For the church is that which completes and displays Christ's glory in the world to come; and then there will be not only Christ in heaven, known to the believer, but Christ ruler over the earth, over all things.<a name=273:9></a> It is a blessed thought, that it is not merely God as God who fills all things, but that Christ in redemption and mediatorial fulness in grace and righteousness fills all things.<a name=273:10></a> "He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.<a name=273:11></a>" Everything from the dust of the earth up to the throne of God has been the scene of the accomplishment of, and witness to, Christ's glory.<a name=273:12></a> But when He does actually thus "fill all things," and it is not merely known to faith, it will not be alone, but as the Head of the body which is now being formed, taking the church to share in His dominion and glory.<a name=273:13></a> All things will be subject to Him in that day; but the church will be associated with Him.<a name=273:14></a> Just as it was in the garden: Adam, the image of Him that was to come, was lord over all the creation; Eve

		Christ has every title to this dominion over all things.<a name=274:3></a> (See <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1">Colossians  1</a>.<a name=274:4></a>) As God, all things were created by Him and for Him.<a name=274:5></a> And remark, that in the passage He has a double primacy -- Head of creation when, as Son, He takes His place in it, for He is Creator; and also Head of the church, for "he is the head of the body the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things he might have the pre-eminence.<a name=274:6></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A second title to headship is, that He is "the Son" -- not merely as Creator (as we have seen in <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1">Colossians  1</a>, "hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son"), but by inheritance also.<a name=274:7></a> In <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1">Hebrews  1</a>we find this counsel and intention of God as regards His Son: "whom he hath appointed heir of all things," etc.<a name=274:8></a> Here Messiah is in contemplation.<a name=274:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A third title to headship is, that He is man.<a name=274:10></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8">Psalm  8</a>, which celebrates millennial glory, is quoted and applied by the Holy Ghost to Christ in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:6">Hebrews  2:6</a>-9, "We see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, crowned with glory and honour," and all things put under his feet.<a name=274:11></a> (See also <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:22">Ephesians  1:22</a>; <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:27">1 Corinthians  15:27</a>.<a name=274:12></a>) Thus we see His title to dominion: first, as Creator, "for by him were all things created"; secondly, as the Son, "whom he hath appointed heir of all things"; thirdly, as Man, under whose feet in the counsels of God all things are put.<a name=274:13></a> Then, we may add, He cannot take the inheritance as a defiled thing, and, therefore, He has a fourth claim in the way of redemption.<a name=274:14></a> His title is to a redeemed and purified inheritance, "the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.<a name=274:15></a>" With us, who were under sin, alienated in mind by wicked works, it is not merely purifying: guilt also is removed.<a name=274:16></a> Then He takes and makes us His body; as it is written, "We are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.<a name=274:17></a>" The Holy Ghost comes down and consecrates us to be the body of Christ in living power; and in unity, because baptised with the Holy Ghost into one body.<a name=274:18></a> Not only is each soul quickened and sealed by the Spirit, but believers are "baptised into one body by one Spirit.<a name=274:19></a>"

		This began at the day of Pentecost, and since then this baptism has been the portion of every believer.<a name=275:1></a> It is a great and blessed truth that, however we may have grieved the Spirit, still, individually, the Holy Ghost abides with the believer and reproves him.<a name=275:2></a> And it is also most blessed as regards the church, that the Holy Ghost is not, like the Lord Jesus, only here a little time with His people, and then going away.<a name=275:3></a> "He shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever.<a name=275:4></a>" And mark this that the abiding presence of the Holy Ghost in the church is in virtue of the redemption which Christ has wrought, and not dependent on our use of the privileges given (though when present His action is according to the use or abuse of these privileges).<a name=275:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The church of God, united to the Lord Jesus Christ, has its place, first, by virtue of Christ's Person; secondly, in redemption by Christ; thirdly, by the presence of the Holy Ghost.<a name=275:6></a> This is not a question of prophecy, but it is the power of divine living grace, putting the church in divine glory.<a name=275:7></a> The moment the Holy Ghost thus formed the church, it is treated down here as the body of Christ, "from which all the body, by joints and bands, having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God.<a name=275:8></a>" Just as, in the growth of a child, the body is there, and each member is in its place, and it grows up into its full stature.<a name=275:9></a>

		There are two distinct aspects of the church, however, presented to us in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1">Ephesians  1</a>and 2 -- the body of Christ is in heaven, and the habitation of God by the Spirit on earth.<a name=275:10></a> This second character of the church is a deeply important one.<a name=275:11></a> The church of God, being formed by the Holy Ghost on the earth, necessarily involves the responsibility of the church to manifest upon the earth the glory of Him that set her thus.<a name=275:12></a> Responsibility never changes God's grace.<a name=275:13></a> But while the church remains upon the earth, she is responsible for the glory of her absent Head down here -- not as under law, of course; but the church is responsible to represent the glory of Him who has redeemed it, and put it here.<a name=275:14></a> It is to be a light in the midst of darkness -- "in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world"; "shewing forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.<a name=275:15></a>" And, as Paul says in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#3">2 Corinthians  3</a>, "Ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ, known and read of all men.<a name=275:16></a>" -- The word is "epistle,"

		and not "epistles," of Christ.<a name=276:1></a> It is one body -- one transcript of Christ.<a name=276:2></a> The church was set as Christ's epistle of commendation to all men, that in it men might read and see the power of redemption, and the character of Him who is out of sight, through the Holy Ghost dwelling in it, and forming it to be the visible witness of its invisible Head.<a name=276:3></a> Jesus says, in <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>, "that they all may be one.<a name=276:4></a>" And to what end?<a name=276:5></a> "That the world may believe [not yet "know" -- that is the fruit of the glory] that thou hast sent me.<a name=276:6></a>" This should have been the effect of this oneness in reference to the present time.<a name=276:7></a> When the church is in manifested glory with Christ, and as Christ, the world must of necessity know that the Father sent the Son; and not only so, but will know that the Father has loved us as He loved Jesus, seeing us in the same glory as Jesus.<a name=276:8></a> It must, therefore, be previous to that time, that the world should see the church as one, in order to believe -- should see the church in this place of responsibility as this epistle of Christ.<a name=276:9></a> Its responsibility is, that the life of the Head in heaven should be manifested on the earth in power.<a name=276:10></a> Thus we see what a responsible place it is to be under grace, for it is through our being under such free grace as we are, that our proper responsibility comes in.<a name=276:11></a> When we come on this ground of a responsible body on the earth, we find the Lord, of course, taking cognisance of the actings of the church under this responsibility.<a name=276:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus in these two chapters (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2">Revelation  2</a>and 3) we have the Lord, not as the Head of the body, not as the One from whom grace is flowing down to the members of the body, but walking amidst the candlesticks in the character of a Judge, to see if they are acting according to the grace received.<a name=276:13></a> This principle of judgment runs through them all: 'I will give unto every one of you according to the use he has made of the privileges and grace in which the church was at first set.<a name=276:14></a>' This is a solemn word for us, just in proportion to our estimation of grace.<a name=276:15></a> It is not condemnation as by the law; but the more I understand the love, of which I have failed to testify, the more my heart will be grieved when I do not give a true answer to that grace, for it connects sin, as it were, with God's name, which I bear.<a name=276:16></a> The effect of Israel's wickedness did not only prove man to be a sinner, but, God having placed His name there, it connected the sin with the name of God.<a name=276:17></a> On this ground it was that the Lord rebuked Israel when He said, "The name of the Lord is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you.<a name=276:18></a>"

		The testimony of His name was placed in their keeping, and it ought to have been guarded by them.<a name=277:1></a> God will know how fully to vindicate His holy name, in the end, on the earth.<a name=277:2></a> Still more is this the case in respect of the church of the living God.<a name=277:3></a> The world ought to see practically perfect holiness and perfect love in the church: for we are made partakers of God's holiness, and we are the objects of His infinite and perfect love.<a name=277:4></a> The church ought to have but one constant position and service on the earth, that of manifesting to the world what it draws from its living Head in heaven.<a name=277:5></a> The church never knew Christ after the flesh; the only Christ the church knows is the Christ that the world rejected, and is now in heaven; and therefore the church should be in such entire abstraction from the world, as to manifest what its Head is.<a name=277:6></a> And thus the church should be Christ's epistle of commendation.<a name=277:7></a> And note the force of the word "epistle" here.<a name=277:8></a> The world ought to see what Christ is in you, as the law was seen written on the tables of stone (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#3">2 Corinthians  3</a>), a living epistle, "known and read of all men.<a name=277:9></a>" And the character of our walk will be greatly deepened, according to the extent we are realising what His grace has done for us, and has called us to.<a name=277:10></a> Thus we see the Lord never gives up this in principle.<a name=277:11></a> He never departs from that into which the church is called in testimony and witness, though He bears with it in patience.<a name=277:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But now we will turn to another point: the use that is to be made of these addresses to the churches.<a name=277:13></a> There are two things on the face of the matter.<a name=277:14></a> First, it is an historical fact, that there were churches on the earth in the condition here spoken of; then, secondly, that the moral instruction is available to every individual saint -- applicable to every person who has an ear to hear and an understanding heart to know the Lord's mind.<a name=277:15></a> This is very simple.<a name=277:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But if we go on farther, we shall find that there is significance in the number of the churches that are addressed.<a name=277:17></a> The number seven, being the symbol of perfection, is the number often used in this book -- seven seals, seven trumpets, seven vials.<a name=277:18></a> Thus the choice of this number marks the complete circle of God's thoughts about the church, as responsible on the earth according to the grace in which it has been set there.<a name=277:19></a> It is not that there were only seven churches or assemblies on the earth at the time these addresses were given, as we know,

		for instance, of Colosse and Thessalonica, and so many others; but these and all the others were left out, because they did not furnish the moral elements which were needed by the Holy Ghost for this complete picture.<a name=278:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When thinking of the unity of the body with the Head, we get into privilege, and not responsibility -- the life of Christ and the glory of Christ as the measure and the end.<a name=278:2></a> But these chapters present the actual and diversified state of the church.<a name=278:3></a> The next point is, that these seven churches are taken up distinctively in connection with responsibility; and then, further, they cannot all apply to the whole body at large at one time, because we find such different states among them, and therefore we cannot apply what is said in one of them indistinctively to another, as there are distinctive charges and distinctive promises.<a name=278:4></a> We shall find, however, on entering into details, that different parts of the professing church with distinctive characters are spoken of as partially subsisting at the same time.<a name=278:5></a> So that we get this: each description does apply, in one sense, to the church at large, yet all do not to the whole church at one and the same time.<a name=278:6></a> And therefore you get in these churches, either a successional picture of the condition of the church upon earth, as responsible to God from the beginning to the end of this dispensation, in a prophetical way, or a particular state of a part necessary to complete the whole picture -- the different aspects that it has presented in the world until the Lord spues it out of His mouth.<a name=278:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, you will say, "How can the church be spued out of Christ's mouth, when the church is the body of Christ, and must be with Him in the glory?<a name=278:8></a>" That is true, if you speak of the body of Christ, but the church as an external body on earth never loses its responsibility, whatever its characteristics may be.<a name=278:9></a> Looked at as on earth, it is responsible for its conduct.<a name=278:10></a> If the unworthy servant did not do his master's will, he was to be treated, not as being not a servant at all, but as a hypocrite according to the position in which he was found, though not as being really such, for servant he was none really.<a name=278:11></a> It was not said to him, "You are no servant"; but, "Cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness .<a name=278:12></a>.<a name=278:13></a>.<a name=278:14></a> and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites.<a name=278:15></a>" Thus he was taken up and condemned on the ground of his profession.<a name=278:16></a>

		with as responsible, and were set aside, as looked at under the old covenant.<a name=279:1></a> The word to the barren fig-tree was, "No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever.<a name=279:2></a>" The fig-tree might bear leaves, but when the Lord came seeking fruit, finding none, He said, "Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward and for ever .<a name=279:3></a>.<a name=279:4></a>.<a name=279:5></a> and presently it withered away" Thus Israel, as a vessel to bear God's name unto the world, was set aside; but this did not touch the question of God's faithfulness.<a name=279:6></a> He will restore Israel in the last days, and till then grace still flows on, taking up the remnant from among them as the true seed of Abraham, only in better privileges; for if Israel as a whole be set aside, then God sets up the new thing, and out of the Jew and Gentile "the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.<a name=279:7></a>" The question here is not as to the certainty of individual salvation, but about the vessel God is using to bear His name before the world.<a name=279:8></a> Individuals who believe will go to heaven, but the vessel of testimony, having failed, must be broken.<a name=279:9></a> God has long patience with it; but if, after all that has been done, it only brings forth wild grapes, it must be cut off.<a name=279:10></a> Doubtless there is a faithful remnant taken to heaven, but the vessel is cast off as a visible public testimony on the earth.<a name=279:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#11">Romans  11</a>we see how God puts what He has formed at present on the earth to bear His name, in the position of a public visible system on the earth, as He did Israel.<a name=279:12></a> "Behold the goodness and severity of God; on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou shalt be cut off.<a name=279:13></a>" God can cast off the professing church in perfect consistency with what He has revealed Himself to be, because it is not a question of His grace and goodness, or of individual salvation, but simply and only of responsibility.<a name=279:14></a> And this it is which makes His dealings with these churches a deep and positive warning to us, as the very same principle applies to Gentile as to Jewish testimony.<a name=279:15></a> God will accomplish to the very word every promise He has made to Israel.<a name=279:16></a> Yet we all know as a plain fact that God has cast off Israel as visible witnesses to bear His name to the world.<a name=279:17></a> And He will, in the same way, cast off the church, if it fails in its responsibility on the earth.<a name=279:18></a> Thus we see how God maintains His government in respect to the testimony which His people ought to bear under every dispensation, and that, while individual salvation is for ever secured to individuals in Israel and

		the church, both will be set aside as to their public visible testimony.<a name=280:1></a> Thus we get not only responsibility but the results of failure.<a name=280:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We will now take up the positive example and warning that God gives us in the word to Ephesus.<a name=280:3></a> It is of course a great means of strengthening the soul -- its being instructed in the ways and actings of God in the Scriptures; but it is a source of joy to myself to get the immediate application of truth to my own soul.<a name=280:4></a> General principles of Scripture are very blessed, but the individual application of truth to the heart and conscience is still more happy.<a name=280:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In these addresses to the churches we have, first, the character of Christ which is always adapted to the state of the particular church.<a name=280:6></a> Thus, in the first, to the Ephesians, as a matter of general application we have, "He that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks" -- that is, Christ revealed in the particular character in which He exercises judgment.<a name=280:7></a> Secondly, in each church we see the special character of the trials of the faithful.<a name=280:8></a> And, thirdly, a special promise is given to sustain the faith of those under the trial.<a name=280:9></a> Thus it is all suited grace and mercy to meet the special circumstances.<a name=280:10></a> And then, fourthly, looking forward to the time of fullest blessing, we see the portion given "to him that overcometh," when Christ has taken the saints to Himself.<a name=280:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The churches are divided into two portions; three churches in the first division, and four in the second.<a name=280:12></a> This is a point of great interest.<a name=280:13></a> The church generally seems to be addressed as such in the first three churches.<a name=280:14></a> That is, saints, though having to overcome, are looked at as in the body at large; the little remnant more distinctively apart in the latter four.<a name=280:15></a> Thus, through this division also, we get distinctive characteristic parts of the professing church.<a name=280:16></a> In the addresses to the first three churches, the exhortation: "He that hath an ear let him hear" -- precedes the promises to the faithful overcomers.<a name=280:17></a> In the latter four it follows the promises.<a name=280:18></a> In the first three the hearing ear is spoken of in connection with the general testimony to the church before singling out the faithful remnant who overcome.<a name=280:19></a> In the last four, the exhortation follows the overcoming.<a name=280:20></a> In the first three, also, the coming of the Lord is not spoken of, but for the same reason as for the greater distinction of the remnant.<a name=280:21></a> With the fourth, attention is
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=281>[Page 281]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		directed to the coming of Christ.<a name=281:1></a> This was now the remnant's hope, not the return to primitive order.<a name=281:2></a> The public professing body was utterly corrupt.<a name=281:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the former three, the thoughts of the church are, as it were, called back to the original condition and standing -- a condition which was held out as one to which it was possible it might be restored if repentant.<a name=281:4></a> We were remarking, in the last lecture, that God had two standards of judgment in dealing with a people placed in responsibility: either the grace which has placed them there, and, therefore, the thought of restoration because of this grace, and according to the standard it has given; or the glory to which they are called.<a name=281:5></a> In the first three churches we find the former of these.<a name=281:6></a> But in Thyatira another thing comes in.<a name=281:7></a> The church as a whole has proved to be in a hopeless condition (I speak of the church in testimony here as a visible body in the world), and then the individual hope is always given, and the address of the Spirit is specially to those that overcome, and, as may be seen, the coming glory at Christ's return held out as the encouragement.<a name=281:8></a> And therefore in Thyatira we get this distinctive hope held out to the remnant, "that which ye have, hold fast till I come.<a name=281:9></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With these general truths I would also remark that in the address to the first church, Ephesus, we see the general character of Christ as exercising judgment, "holding the seven stars in his right hand" (that is, holding all the authority and all the power), "walking in the midst of the seven candlesticks," the churches -- going round to see whether the lights were burning brightly, giving out that true light which He had lit up.<a name=281:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We see, consequently, in every one of them the peculiar stamp of responsibility.<a name=281:11></a> Then, observe how He commences this Ephesian address, by touching upon every point that He can in any way approve of, before He brings out the opposite side of the picture.<a name=281:12></a> "I know thy works, thy labour, and thy patience.<a name=281:13></a>" What a blessing that He does know all about us, even "the thoughts and intents of the heart!<a name=281:14></a>" "Nevertheless, I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.<a name=281:15></a>" Now mark another important principle.<a name=281:16></a> What must Christ necessarily be jealous about but His love to the church, which was stronger than death?<a name=281:17></a> It is utterly impossible that He can forget His love to the church, and therefore just as impossible that He can be satisfied without the return of her love to Him; for, remember, that it is only love that can
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=282>[Page 282]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		satisfy love.<a name=282:1></a> The very reproach He makes brings out the strength of His love to the church, which cannot rest till it gets the same from her; for He cannot cool down to be satisfied with a feeble return of His love, however much the church may have cooled down in her thoughts about Christ's love to her.<a name=282:2></a> There may be still much outward fruit in "works, and labour, and patience"; but let the toil and labour be what it may, the spring of it all is gone -- You have left your first love; there is the great mischief.<a name=282:3></a> It is no matter how much you toil and labour, if love to Christ be not the motive of all your service, it will only be, as the apostle says, "like sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal," which dies with the sound thereof.<a name=282:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here, then, in Ephesus, we get the first great principle of failure, and therefore the great general judgment which came upon the whole church.<a name=282:5></a> "Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works [see how He brings them back to the point of their departure], or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.<a name=282:6></a>" He cannot allow that to remain in the world which fails to shew forth the great love wherewith He loved the church; for if He did, He would not be "the faithful and true witness.<a name=282:7></a>" This principle of tender, faithful reproach is the blessed proof that His love never grows cold, however much ours may fail.<a name=282:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this respect the Lord's way of dealing with individual souls is exactly the same as with the church.<a name=282:9></a> He takes notice of all departure from Him, but the door is always open for "repentance," and when the sin is judged, and seen in the light in which God sees it, then there is nothing to hinder immediate restoration.<a name=282:10></a> The moment the conscience bows under the sin, and confesses it, then it gets into an upright position; an uprightness of soul, where evil has been, is shewn in the consciousness of evil, and power to confess it; and therefore the church of God, or an individual soul, must get into this state of uprightness before God, in order for Him to restore it; <a href="../bible/Job.htm#33:23">Job  33:23</a>-26.<a name=282:11></a> Get sin judged in the conscience, and then there is the revelation of the unfailing love of God to meet the need.<a name=282:12></a> It is thus in the daily details of Christian life.<a name=282:13></a> Judgments may pass upon His people, but His chastening love is seen in it all.<a name=282:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And thus is learned the reason why the Lord reproaches

		the church for leaving her first love.<a name=283:1></a> There is in it the revelation of His perfect and unchanged love shining through the condemnation of their state.<a name=283:2></a> And do we not see this dawn in the natural relationships of life?<a name=283:3></a> Take husband and wife.<a name=283:4></a> A wife may take care of the house and fulfil all her duties so as to leave nothing undone for which her husband could find fault; but if her love for him has diminished, will all her service satisfy him if his love to her be the same as at the first?<a name=283:5></a> No.<a name=283:6></a> Well, then, if it will not do for him, it will not do for Christ: He must have the reflection of His love.<a name=283:7></a> He says, I am not blind to your good qualities, but I want yourself.<a name=283:8></a> Love, which was once the spring of every action, is gone; and therefore the service is valueless.<a name=283:9></a> If love is wanting, the rest is as nothing.<a name=283:10></a> It is true that our love cannot answer worthily, but still it may answer truly; for at least Christ looks for undividedness of object, though there be not adequateness of affection.<a name=283:11></a> There must be a dividedness of heart if there is instability of affection.<a name=283:12></a> This was the secret of all the failure at Ephesus.<a name=283:13></a> Undividedness of heart as regarded the object of affection had been lost, singleness of eye was gone, and the perfect reflection of that love which had laid hold of the church for Himself was gone.<a name=283:14></a> Still, while Christ says, "I have somewhat against thee," He marks everything that is good.<a name=283:15></a> "Thou hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted.<a name=283:16></a>" Well, then, it might be said, What can the Lord want more?<a name=283:17></a> He says, I want herself.<a name=283:18></a> Remember this as regards the church.<a name=283:19></a> Then He says, "Remember, therefore, from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works.<a name=283:20></a>" To me this is a very solemn but touching word to us, for we have gone much farther from our first love than they; still the heart of him that is faithful finds a certain refuge in Christ, for his soul finds in the very reproach an infallible proof of His unchanged love.<a name=283:21></a>

		Take the Thessalonians, who, in this, are in direct contrast to these Ephesian saints, and who were in the freshness of their "first love," and what is noticed in them?<a name=284:1></a> "Their work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ" -- just the very same things that are commended in Ephesus.<a name=284:2></a> What was the difference, then?<a name=284:3></a> Not that they had no works, but that the true spring of them was gone; while in the Thessalonians the spring of it all was in full play.<a name=284:4></a> The three great principles of Christianity, faith, hope, and love were all at Thessalonica (that is, the full link of the heart with the source of power).<a name=284:5></a> The faith which characterised their "work" kept them walking in communion with God.<a name=284:6></a> The love which characterised their "labour" linked them with the source of power.<a name=284:7></a> And in the "hope" which characterised their patience we get the coming of the Lord, as the object before their souls, for their patient waiting in service.<a name=284:8></a> Thus, in the Thessalonians you get spiritual power, Christ Himself as the object, and love characterising it all.<a name=284:9></a> Suppose I go labouring, and the spirit of love is in my work, what a difference there will be when the whole service is stamped with the character of this love!<a name=284:10></a> If it is only in preaching the gospel, how fully shall I set forth God's love to a lost world, if the love of Christ is freshly springing up in my own soul!<a name=284:11></a> But alas!<a name=284:12></a> how often have we to reproach ourselves with going on in a round of Christian duty, faithful in general intention, but not flowing from the fresh realisation of the love of Christ to our souls.<a name=284:13></a>

		But righteousness and true holiness, and the aspect of the church in connection with these characters of God, have their place as well as the love which is His nature.<a name=284:14></a> "Thou canst not bear them that are evil.<a name=284:15></a>" The natural, the normal state of the church, is the full power of good in the midst of evil, giving a bright testimony through divine power.<a name=284:16></a> The church ought not to be the place where good and evil are in conflict within, but in such a state as to be the manifestation of good in the midst of evil.<a name=284:17></a> But suppose a decline, then there is a question of evil within.<a name=284:18></a> "Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water" is the only right state of the church.<a name=284:19></a> This is its primary and only absolutely owned state.<a name=284:20></a> Next comes power to remove the evil and make it an occasion of blessing when it does arise.<a name=284:21></a> (See Acts.<a name=284:22></a>) But if it ceases to be thus, then a question of evil within it arises, as here: "Thou canst not bear them that are evil.<a name=284:23></a>" Now evil had come in, or this would

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But then we get another principle.<a name=285:14></a> There are cases in which Christ approves hatred.<a name=285:15></a> "Thou hatest" that "which I also hate.<a name=285:16></a>" The doctrine of the Nicolaitanes brought in a licence to evil with the character of grace, thus putting into association Christ and evil.<a name=285:17></a> And this is a terrible thing -- the bringing in that which associates God with evil; for Satan would imitate or counterfeit grace, and thus associate God with evil, the very thing that God says -- "my soul hateth.<a name=285:18></a>" We have seen that the character in which Christ is presented is connected with judgment.<a name=285:19></a> He is walking amidst the candlesticks.<a name=285:20></a> And here, being the general and introductory church, the judgment also is the general resulting judgment.<a name=285:21></a> The warning therefore is, that the church will be removed.<a name=285:22></a> In sum, we get the three points, responsibility, failure, and consequent judgment.<a name=285:23></a> Then, with respect to the promise, "To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God," the paradise which He has made for Himself.<a name=285:24></a> It is not the paradise in which God visited man to see what he was doing, as He came to Adam, and if doing well, He was to allow him to remain, but

		if evil, to turn him out; but it is God taking man into His own paradise.<a name=286:1></a> What a difference between the paradise of man, into which God came and found sin there, and so cast man out, and the paradise of God, into which man is taken as the result of redemption, to go no more out.<a name=286:2></a> There are no two trees here; there is no tree of the knowledge of good and evil here -- we have had plenty of it in our own responsibility.<a name=286:3></a> We shall possess it there according to the holiness of God; indeed, in nature we do so already, being renewed in knowledge according to the image of Him that created us in righteousness and true holiness.<a name=286:4></a> But there is but one tree, and this the tree of life, the one unfailing perfect source of life in God; and one partaking of it -- the result, not of responsibility, but of redemption and life-giving power, and a redemption according to God's own counsels and thoughts -- responsibility not being dispensed with, but fulfilled according to Christ's own love.<a name=286:5></a> "To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life.<a name=286:6></a>" Grace had sustained the individual that overcame; and when the church had failed, instead of sailing on with the stream of failure (the heart of the individual saint having spiritual energy to form an estimate of the failure within, and judge it in the sight of God, instead of being discouraged and sinking when others were letting go their first love) they themselves overcame.<a name=286:7></a> But then it is well to see that grace did it all.<a name=286:8></a> "My grace is sufficient for thee.<a name=286:9></a>" And the result was, that they had their place in God's paradise, feeding on all the ripe fruit the tree of life could produce.<a name=286:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In applying all this as a general principle we find the secret testimony of grace to the hearts of the faithful to be the source of strength.<a name=286:11></a> If "to me to live is Christ," it is the testimony of unfailing grace that carries me through all trials and difficulties; nay, the greater the trial and failure, the more it brings out what God is to my soul, so that I know God in a way that I never knew Him before (like Abraham, who, "when he was tried, offered up Isaac"; and then he learned God as a "God of resurrection," which he had never thus known before).<a name=286:12></a> What a comfort it is to find Christ so much the more enjoyed the more we are in the midst of hindrances, and, seeing the failure, look to Him who never fails!<a name=286:13></a> "The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he will shew them his covenant.<a name=286:14></a>"

		<h3>LECTURE 3</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We saw in our last lecture that the character of judgment runs through the whole of the book of Revelation -- first of all among the churches, and then in the world.<a name=287:4></a> So that we have the Lord walking in the midst of the candlesticks, exercising judgment, taking notice of all that is going on, and saying, "I will give unto every one of you according to your works.<a name=287:5></a>" And we also saw the importance of remembering the distinction between the church as seen in Christ in heaven, and seen on the earth, as representing Christ.<a name=287:6></a> We are partakers of His life, and united to Him in heaven; but it is equally true that He has set the church as a vessel to bear His name before the world, "the epistle of Christ known and read of all men.<a name=287:7></a>" We also remarked, that the responsibility of the church down here does not touch the question of salvation in any wise; and also that God's faithfulness to individuals does not touch the judgment of the corporate body bearing His name.<a name=287:8></a> God had promised in His faithfulness to carry them on to the fulness of His glory; but, at the same time, He must judge them for failure in the responsibility in which He has placed them down here.<a name=287:9></a> We must not confound His judgment of the vessel set in testimony on the earth, and His faithfulness to the church -- the bride, united by the Holy Ghost to Christ in heaven.<a name=287:10></a> But, moreover, God judges His saints individually for their good by exercising their hearts and consciences in warnings; and bowing under His judgments, they are blessed, while "the simple pass on and are punished" (<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#22:3">Proverbs  22:3</a>), and at length, as a body, are spued out of His mouth, while all the trials, discipline, and chastenings turn to the profit of the church as to its heavenly calling.<a name=287:11></a> In the address to each church there is a peculiar revelation of Christ made, with which the peculiar judgment corresponds; and also special promises, suited to
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=288>[Page 288]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		their special need, meeting the exercise of the heart in order to sustain it, and pledges given to the faithful.<a name=288:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have seen that the very first thing that characterised the church, looked at in its responsibility as pictured by Ephesus, was, that it had departed from the power of its original standing, "left its first love.<a name=288:2></a>" Nor is the subject now the supply of grace from the Head; it is no longer "that which every joint supplieth," but the giving of reproofs, warnings, and promises, to act on the hearts and consciences of individual saints in their responsibility down here.<a name=288:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thing which it is well to remember here is, that we shall never find the object of the address to be the power of the Holy Ghost actively at work to form and gather.<a name=288:4></a> If it is judgment which is spoken of, it clearly cannot be, for Christ can never be said to judge the work of the Holy Ghost.<a name=288:5></a> It is power working in grace, if the Holy Ghost works.<a name=288:6></a> Christ, in exercising His judgment, is shewing forth His estimate of the practical use which has been made of the work of the Spirit after it has been given.<a name=288:7></a> The first great truth is, that the Lord looks at the church as responsible for all the love of which it is the object, and expects a return; and if He finds it not, but finds departure from the first love, which is only the sad commencement of greater failure, then He says, "Repent, or I will remove thy candlestick out of its place.<a name=288:8></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, again, mark another thing.<a name=288:9></a> It is not individuals who are judged here, but churches (although individuals may hear and profit by the warnings).<a name=288:10></a> Thus the Spirit speaks to the churches; but there being no response from the church, no repenting, no doing the first works, no returning to the first love, the candlestick is to be removed.<a name=288:11></a> And then the address comes individually to him "that hath an ear -- let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.<a name=288:12></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But although as a church it has failed, and the candlestick must be removed, still there is such a thing as individual energy to overcome.<a name=288:13></a> And mark here that it is overcoming in the condition in which the church found itself.<a name=288:14></a> The responsibility of individuals is that of overcoming where they were.<a name=288:15></a> This was very different from the state of things when the fulness of blessing was poured in by the Holy Ghost.<a name=288:16></a> There was now that within the church which was to be overcome, not in the world merely.<a name=288:17></a> "This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.<a name=288:18></a>" He will revive the heart of the faithful one

		by promises to sustain it against the snare of Satan in the world; but when decay has come in, then the conscience necessarily becomes exercised as to maintenance of their standing where they were.<a name=289:1></a> Snares, difficulties, and dangers had come in; for we must remember, that the church had fallen from its first love, when Smyrna was addressed; and the moment the church is addressed by the Spirit, as a fallen church, it ceases to be in itself the place of security for the saint; he cannot take for granted, that, in walking with it, he walks according to the power and will of God.<a name=289:2></a> A fallen church cannot secure me from error; being itself under judgment, it cannot be a guarantee for anything.<a name=289:3></a> In truth it never was, but apostolic power and energy, which sustained and watched over it, while the apostles lived.<a name=289:4></a> (See <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20:28">Acts  20:28</a>, 29, and <a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#1:15">2 Peter  1:15</a>.<a name=289:5></a>)

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then individuals are singled out, for the church can no longer warrant me in this or that.<a name=289:6></a> The church may be right in this or that, but I have to make good my security against, or at any rate independent of, the church by the word of God; for I must discern what I can follow, and what I cannot, by the word of God applied by the Spirit.<a name=289:7></a> But then this state of things by no means supposes that there was no blessing, that there was nothing excellent left in the church; for we find the Lord recognising and commending many things.<a name=289:8></a> But surely I need scarcely say, how amazingly important is this principle, that a failing church ceases to be a guarantee; and, therefore, I have to judge in individual responsibility what I am to receive and what I am to reject.<a name=289:9></a> The church has been, as set up of God, a place of blessing as regards individuals, a guardian for Christ of the state they were in, as being the vessel and expression of the power of the Holy Ghost, the proper result of His working; but it is not so at all now that it has left its first estate; and, as we have remarked, the apostles alone ever maintained it in it practically, as in the case of Ananias and Sapphira, the church of Corinth, etc.<a name=289:10></a> Our responsibility, however, never changes; nor can Christ fail in needed grace for the state in which the church is.<a name=289:11></a>

		I would here take the opportunity of making a remark on the word "development," which Satan has brought in as a very favourite word.<a name=289:12></a> Now there is perfect and entire infidelity involved in this thought of development in the church of the Living God.<a name=289:13></a> There is nothing in God to be developed; He is the perfect unchangeable source of all.<a name=289:14></a> Now what God has

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus man in innocence was set up perfect in that innocence, and Adam fell.<a name=290:15></a> The priesthood of Aaron was perfect in its kind, but there was failure in Nadab and Abihu.<a name=290:16></a> Whatever God has planted, He has planted wholly a right seed according to His mind.<a name=290:17></a> Whatever comes from God must be perfect, and cannot be made more perfect by any other operation whatever.<a name=290:18></a> This is a very simple truth; but it is one which cuts up by the roots and overturns a whole system of thoughts and feelings which would put something between our souls and Christ.<a name=290:19></a> It is not that God cannot reveal in the creature more than He has yet revealed, and accomplish what is better than what went before.<a name=290:20></a> He does so: the Second Adam is clearly infinitely more excellent than the first.<a name=290:21></a> But the thing that He sets up is absolutely perfect, as the expression of His mind in that thing.<a name=290:22></a> Man cannot improve or add to it.<a name=290:23></a> The thing set up for us is the perfect manifestation of God in Christ; hence the notion of development is rejection of the true object, or blasphemy.<a name=290:24></a> So John says, "that which was from the beginning," when he would keep the saints secure.<a name=290:25></a>

		But even as to glory, as in man's responsibility, that passes away.<a name=291:1></a> God had "planted thee a noble vine; how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me?<a name=291:2></a>" From this cause -- that, directly a thing is put into a man's hand, there is departure.<a name=291:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then we get another principle.<a name=291:4></a> This departure having come in, God uses Satan's power, acting through the world's hostility, for two ends: first, to exercise the divine life in a saint; secondly, to hinder a further departure from the Lord.<a name=291:5></a> This is the "tribulation" they were to have; and, therefore, when we come to Smyrna, we hear of persecutions.<a name=291:6></a> If you take the history of the life of Christ, it was an exercise of trial and suffering until He reached the cross; it was not that He needed it to deliver Him from any existing evil; it only brought out His perfectness more fully, that He might be made perfect in the just result, in glory as man, of what He was morally.<a name=291:7></a> "Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things that he suffered.<a name=291:8></a>" The manifestation of all that was in Him was brought out through opposition and slighting.<a name=291:9></a> His path became darker and darker down to the cross.<a name=291:10></a> He had to overcome Satan, and says for others, "to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me on my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father on his throne.<a name=291:11></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second end to which God uses Satan's power, in persecutions and trials to the saints, is to hinder a further departure from Himself.<a name=291:12></a> There is a constant tendency in the heart of the saints to take rest in prosperous circumstances, because the flesh naturally turns to that which is agreeable in the world for rest, the result of which is a decay of vitality within; but this will not do.<a name=291:13></a> Therefore God says, "Arise and depart, for this is not your rest, it is polluted.<a name=291:14></a>" Persecution is the natural portion of the church of God, while down here, in a world of sin.<a name=291:15></a> And when the church began to take rest at the beginning, God was obliged very soon to bring in persecution amongst them.<a name=291:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		To return -- God sends us tribulation, opposition from without, to bring out grace and to hinder the constant tendency to decay; with Christ it was always and only to bring out grace.<a name=292:9></a> Thus God uses Satan as an instrument to work out blessing even for the church.<a name=292:10></a> Take Job, for instance.<a name=292:11></a> How wondrously was Satan used of God for blessing in Job's case!<a name=292:12></a> It is God who begins the conversation with Satan, and He knew perfectly well all He was doing in attracting Satan's attention to Job, and says, "Hast thou considered my servant Job?<a name=292:13></a>" Satan's malice was quite ready to plague and persecute him; but this malice of Satan was used by God to bring Job to that which was necessary for his blessing -- the knowledge of the evil that was in his heart, which he could not have so learned any other way.<a name=292:14></a> Then, again, take Paul.<a name=292:15></a> He was taken up into the third heaven, there to get such a sense of the power of God as would fit him for his peculiar service to the church and the world, and such a revelation of the glory of Jesus as was proper to sustain him under all the trials he must inevitably pass through.<a name=292:16></a> And what is the use the flesh would make of this?<a name=292:17></a> Why it would puff up, and say, "Now, Paul, you have been into the third heaven, and nobody has been there but you.<a name=292:18></a>" So there was given to him a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet him; and for this he besought the Lord thrice that it might depart from him; but no, it cannot be removed, lest Paul should be exalted above measure.<a name=292:19></a> But he gets this assurance -- "my grace is sufficient for thee.<a name=292:20></a>" That

		The manna signifies the Son of God become incarnate to give life to our souls, His entering in humiliation into all our circumstances, and is the provision for the daily walk through the wilderness: for we find the manna spoken of in connection with Jesus as the living bread sent down from heaven.<a name=302:4></a> "This is the true bread which cometh down from heaven," <a href="../bible/John.htm#6">John  6</a>.<a name=302:5></a> But what then is the <i>hidden</i> manna?<a name=302:6></a> The manna for Israel was spread around the camp; and they were to gather it daily for their food.<a name=302:7></a> And so likewise is Christ to be the daily provision of the soul while in this wilderness world; but this is not the hidden manna.<a name=302:8></a> There was to be a golden pot of manna laid up before God, and when the Israelites had got into the land, they were to have the memorial of what they had enjoyed in the wilderness.<a name=302:9></a> This hidden manna is the remembrance of a suffering Christ down here -- the memory of what Christ has been in the wilderness, as a man, an humbled, suffering man, and who is God's eternal delight in heaven; and in our eternal state, he that has overcome, he that has been faithful in separation with Christ from the world, will have the everlasting enjoyment of fellowship with God in His delight in a once humbled Christ -- the same kind of delight, although in a different measure.<a name=302:10></a> If we are walking faithfully with a rejected Christ, instead of letting Balaam into our hearts, we shall enjoy Christ thus down here in spirit; but we cannot enjoy Christ in our souls, if we are mixed up with ungodliness in the world: if we pretend to it, then it becomes Nicolaitanism.<a name=302:11></a> But in proportion as we get and apprehend the secret of what Christ was in the world, in our souls, shall we feed upon Him; but this cannot be, if we are walking in the spirit of the world.<a name=302:12></a> Even the presentation of Christ in the gospels we cannot enjoy, unless it is as food for the soul.<a name=302:13></a> A man may say that truth is very beautiful; but if it only

		It is sorrowful enough what a Balaam is teaching in the church; but then, mark, there cannot be any trouble among the saints that does not bring out the faithfulness of Him who waits to bless the "overcomer," and thus bring the soul into communion with Christ in a way that nothing else could.<a name=303:18></a> For nothing gives the blessed consciousness of Christ's approbation as between the soul and Himself, like faithfulness where evil

		<h3>LECTURE 4</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I alluded in a few words the last evening to the church of Thyatira on account of the connection of Balaam and Jezebel: Balaam being a prophet acting among the saints to seduce them; and Jezebel, a prophetess, established within, being a farther advance in evil -- not merely a seducer, as Balaam, but a mother of children there, as Jezebel, having children of this corruption.<a name=305:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And now we get (in this part of the chapter) into what we may call new ground.<a name=305:2></a> Two things mark this.<a name=305:3></a> The Spirit of God, who rises far above all our failure, directs the eye of the faithful remnant to the coming of the Lord Jesus.<a name=305:4></a> And the expression, "he that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches," is no longer in connection with the address to the church in general, but after the promises to them that "overcome.<a name=305:5></a>" And this marks out the remnant as separate from the body in general.<a name=305:6></a> The position of the remnant is specially marked out as being no longer in connection with the general body of the church, but with the place in which those stand to whom the promise is sent, as "to him that overcometh.<a name=305:7></a>" In the address to this church, and to the three following churches, the exhortation to hear is placed <i>after</i> the special promise.<a name=305:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The distinguishing element which we found brought into the last church (Pergamos) is, that the world is the place of Satan's throne.<a name=305:9></a> Therefore the church must be in either of these two positions -- a persecuted suffering church in the world because of faithfulness, or lose that character and be brought to acquiesce and go on in the world.<a name=305:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We saw in Ephesus decline marking its state -- "thou hast left thy first love.<a name=305:11></a>" In Smyrna, persecution comes in, "the devil shall cast some of you into prison," thus brightening them up for God.<a name=305:12></a> And afterwards, in Pergamos, corrupting instructions go on within; and all these, not with respect to individual failure, but to the corporate state of the church, it being that which was characterising the church at certain periods of time in this dispensation.<a name=305:13></a> In the address to Pergamos, we find the seductive teaching going on to corrupt what was within, but not as yet established and settled within, so that what characterised the within should be productive of evil.<a name=305:14></a> The motherhood of evil was now in the church.<a name=305:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Balaam the false prophet was seducing, and joining the church to the world.<a name=306:1></a> "Thou hast them that hold the doctrine of Balaam"; and to the "overcomer," the individual promise and blessing of the hidden manna and the white stone are given.<a name=306:2></a> But now there is something farther -- " thou sufferest that woman Jezebel.<a name=306:3></a>" Here the evil was allowed.<a name=306:4></a> We saw that, when Balaam failed in getting God to curse Israel, he then tried to bring them into trouble through association in evil with the people of the adversary.<a name=306:5></a> This has now succeeded in the professing church.<a name=306:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Thyatira, therefore, we have a still more terrible state of things than in Pergamos.<a name=306:7></a> There was not only the evil teaching -- those who "hold the doctrine of Balaam," but a person established within, having children of this seduction; not merely seducing God's children into it, but Jezebel was, so to speak, so much at home there, that children were born, finding their home and birthplace in the evil, yea, springing from the very corruption itself.<a name=306:8></a> But then mark that, in this increased evil and wickedness, we find also increased energy on the part of the faithful ones; for God had a remnant in the midst of the evil, whose faithfulness shone out the brighter by reason of the dense darkness around.<a name=306:9></a> We see this exemplified in Israel's history.<a name=306:10></a> In the midst of idolatry, worshipping the golden calf, or under a persecuting Jezebel, men of power, like Elijah and Elisha, were raised up in a special power of testimony for God, thus manifesting that God was and is ever sufficient for His people's need.<a name=306:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When evil is at such a height as to make it impossible for the faithful ones to go along with it, then they get into a more advanced state of knowledge and power in separation from it (although it may be one of much more trial) than they had when the church was in a more prosperous condition.<a name=306:12></a> In the times of Elijah God preserved His name in a most special way.<a name=306:13></a> The whole nation of Israel had got so dreadfully bad, that God would be obliged to cut them off; but the time had not yet come.<a name=306:14></a> But in the time of Elijah they had nothing rightly in order; there was neither temple, nor sacrifice, nor priesthood at Mount Carmel; nevertheless God was there for the faithful few, in a way that the people at Jerusalem had not the knowledge and enjoyment of; for the mighty power of God was there to give testimony to the word of His prophet.<a name=306:15></a> And so again with Moses, he went on faithfully with the Lord while Israel was

	<div class="paragraph">
		failing all around him.<a name=307:1></a> It was not when Israel was going on well that Moses was the nearest to God, but when they had all gone wrong.<a name=307:2></a> When the golden calf was made, then "Moses took the tabernacle and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp"; and then he went to meet with God, and there "the Lord spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend.<a name=307:3></a>" And we find God referring to this in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#12">Numbers  12</a>as gloriously distinguishing Moses.<a name=307:4></a> When Aaron and Miriam spake against Moses, and not on Moses's going up to God on Mount Sinai, God says, "Were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses, who is faithful in all mine house?<a name=307:5></a> With him will I speak mouth to mouth.<a name=307:6></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When Moses met God in the tabernacle outside the camp, he was more excellent, so to speak, than when God called him to the top of Mount Sinai.<a name=307:7></a> Indeed, we find it a constant principle in Scripture that, where there is most manifest and universal failure, there God brings out in His faithful ones far greater testimony and power than had been known in the body as a whole, thus shewing, as Jethro says, "In the thing wherein they dealt proudly [by their sin and rebellion against God] God was above them" in grace and power.<a name=307:8></a> It was so in the time of the Lord Jesus, who was a most blessed and glorious example of this principle; being the Lord Himself, who brought out the fullest and most blessed testimony of grace and righteousness to bear upon the ways of the world, and of His own people, at the moment of Israel's and the world's darkest and deepest sin of crucifying God's Son.<a name=307:9></a> For at the very time that Israel's heart was made fat -- when they were in a condition to receive seven other spirits more wicked than him that had of old possessed them, ready to merge into that last state which was worse than the first, then God, who had before spoken to them in divers manners by sacrifice and type and prophets, spoke to them by His Son, in the Person of the meek and lowly Jesus.<a name=307:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is the case when Jezebel is come in here at Thyatira.<a name=307:11></a> "I know thy works, and the last to be more than the first.<a name=307:12></a>" The effect of the condition of the professing church was to drive saints into a kind of energy they had not before known.<a name=307:13></a> So indeed has it ever been in the history of the church in what has been called "the dark ages.<a name=307:14></a>" We find the most faithful testimony, such a measure of devotedness (which I am sure I should be glad to see now in any way) unknown at other

		"I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and works, and the last to be more than the first.<a name=308:2></a>" Here we get the love and the faith working, which were wanting in Ephesus; and now the Lord says, I will encourage them with "hope," so that we get faith, hope, and charity, the three great principles of Christianity.<a name=308:3></a> Although not produced in their own happy order, as in Thessalonians, still they are all here in a way.<a name=308:4></a> And mark how quick-sighted God always is, to take notice of the good things, and that before He speaks of the evil things.<a name=308:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We get this character of judgment in Christ here.<a name=308:6></a> "These things saith the Son of God, whose eyes are like a flame of fire, and his feet like unto fine brass.<a name=308:7></a>" Fire is a symbol of unfailing judgment; this penetrated everywhere, as the eye of God.<a name=308:8></a> But what does He first see?<a name=308:9></a> He sees at once, no doubt, through this terrible evil; but He notices first what delights His heart in these poor saints that nobody cared anything about.<a name=308:10></a> He sees that which is delightsome to Himself in the despised few; and while His feet, like unto fine brass, mark the unchangeable character of that righteousness which God (in His spiritual dealings with and claims upon man) manifests down here, and which sustains His pure and infallible judgment.<a name=308:11></a> Hence the altar of sacrifice in the tabernacle was of brass, and which in man was divinely accomplished in Christ, and characterised His Person; yet the eye of God rests upon the very least spark of faithfulness in the midst of evil.<a name=308:12></a> There is not one throb of the heart that beats true to Himself, in the midst of abounding iniquity, that passes unheeded by him; and this is what sustains the heart in the midst of untoward circumstances.<a name=308:13></a> And happy it is for us to know (in the simplicity of faith) and realise in power in our souls, the full meaning of those two little words, "I know," thus walking in the happy consciousness that the eye of God is upon our walk and ways.<a name=308:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 20.<a name=308:15></a> "I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel," etc.<a name=308:16></a> Now the church, taken as a whole, is characterised by suffering the evil; it is not now as before, "thou canst not bear them that are evil"; there was now the full public allowance of this spirit of evil which was in the church.<a name=308:17></a> This was going much farther down the scale than merely having the evil teaching among them: "thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and seduce my servants.<a name=308:18></a>"

		They suffered a woman, having a professed character in the church, "who calleth herself a prophetess" -- a false one surely, yet one who professed to hold and teach the word of God in the church.<a name=309:1></a> "I gave her space to repent, and she repented not.<a name=309:2></a>" Thus we see God does not all at once deal in judgment with her, but gives her time for repentance; He has patience with her, but she does not repent.<a name=309:3></a> He was not dealing with the heathen here: to them He preaches the gospel, that their souls may be won to Christ.<a name=309:4></a> But here was one who called herself a prophetess in the church, teaching God's servants to "commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols," and God deals with her on this ground of her profession.<a name=309:5></a> He "gave her space to repent of her fornication, and she repented not": therefore He must execute judgment.<a name=309:6></a>

		And mark, that there is no mention made here of a candlestick.<a name=309:7></a> He gave her space to repent; but it is not said here, "I will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent" -- for Jezebel is not indeed acknowledged as a candlestick.<a name=309:8></a> There are two characters of judgment, for they were not all the children of Jezebel.<a name=309:9></a> To commit adultery is a common figure in Scripture for tampering with evil, particularly idolatrous evil, because it was God's people giving themselves to others than Him.<a name=309:10></a> First, "Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.<a name=309:11></a>" Secondly, "And I will kill her children with death.<a name=309:12></a>" There are those that are not her children, but people who have to say to her, who are content to associate and have fellowship with the evil.<a name=309:13></a> Them I will punish, they shall eat the fruit of their ways: "and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts.<a name=309:14></a>" I will see who are content to float down the stream with the evil, or who make a stand in faithfulness to me.<a name=309:15></a> Them that have committed adultery with her, that have tampered with this spirit of false prophecy, "I will cast into great tribulation, except they repent"; but those who are her children, who have got their Christian place and name in virtue of this false doctrine, they shall have full judgment, "I will kill her children with death.<a name=309:16></a>" It is not merely tribulation for them, for they are objects of full and complete judgment: time having been given them for repentance, those that

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How sad it is, how very sad, to see Christians, as we often do, tampering with such evil.<a name=310:2></a> Take, for instance, the Galatians: there were saints there who were tampering with Judaism, who wanted to bring in the law; it is not that they were not Christians, but they were mixed up with that which was utterly hateful to God.<a name=310:3></a> Paul, therefore, says to them, "I stand in doubt of you," though afterwards his faith links them with their risen Head, and in virtue of Christ's unfailing grace, and their completeness in Him, he says, "I have confidence in you through the Lord.<a name=310:4></a>" It requires great watchfulness, for the soul is ever in danger of being mixed up with principles which God utterly hates.<a name=310:5></a> In Colossians they were not holding the head; they were putting something between the head and the members.<a name=310:6></a> The apostle Paul is in an agony when he sees anything coming in to separate the saint from his immediate, proper, and personal connection with Christ.<a name=310:7></a> If it be a true Christian that is thus tampering with evil, he must be put into tribulation to be brightened up for God; and if he be not converted, then there is nothing before him but judgment.<a name=310:8></a> So all who in the public Christian world of the day tamper with the corruption of Christianity, represented by Jezebel in Thyatira, will be cast into desperate distress, if they repent not of their deeds.<a name=310:9></a> It is a very solemn thought, but a true one, that God having taught the saints that they are one with Christ, he who puts anything whatever between them and the Head, virtually denies Christianity.<a name=310:10></a> It was the great truth given to the apostle Paul to unfold; it was what he received specially from the Lord: "I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.<a name=310:11></a>" Therefore it was that it puts Paul's mind into an agony, whatever it might be, whether works of the law, priesthood, or anything else, which, coming in between the soul and Christ, denied the great truth he had learned, the very truth that he was converted to, that the church was one with Christ, members of His body, of His flesh, and of His bones.<a name=310:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This blessed truth, held in the simplicity of faith, gives power to the soul, and sweeps everything else away; and it also sweeps through the whole course of the Christian's daily life, if he has anything between his soul and Christ.<a name=310:13></a> If I were a Jew I should want something on the earth, and some one

		Now mark the character God takes: "I am he that searcheth the hearts and the reins.<a name=311:18></a>" You shall not escape me; and however plausible the evil may be, and however you may put the name of the Lord upon it (as Israel put Jehovah's to the golden calf when they said, "These be thy gods, O Israel .<a name=311:19></a>.<a name=311:20></a>.<a name=311:21></a> tomorrow is a feast to Jehovah," <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#32:4">Exodus  32:4</a>,5), still it will meet with full judgment, because you have put my saints lower

		To see the coming of the Lord Jesus for the church changes the character of a thousand scriptures.<a name=322:5></a> Take the Psalms for instance -- those which speak about judgments on the ungodly, such as "the righteous washing their feet in the blood of the wicked.<a name=322:6></a>" We are not the persons who say this.<a name=322:7></a> It is the language of Jews, and of godly Jews too, who will be delivered through the rod of power smiting their enemies, when all the tribes of the earth will wail because of Him.<a name=322:8></a> But do I want my enemies to be destroyed to get to Christ?<a name=322:9></a> Certainly not.<a name=322:10></a> I shall leave them to be with Him.<a name=322:11></a> It is a sorrowful thought indeed, though we recognise the just judgment of God, that such judgment will be accomplished upon those who despise Him and His grace.<a name=322:12></a> But as for me, I am going straight up to Christ in heaven.<a name=322:13></a> My place is in Him, while He is hid in God, in the nearest and most intimate union.<a name=322:14></a> I belong to the bride, a member of His body, of His flesh, and of His bones.<a name=322:15></a> When we have hold of this blessed centre, Christ, and with Him, therefore, of God Himself, then every scripture falls into its proper place; and we get a spiritual understanding by the Holy Ghost of things in heaven and our connection with them, and things on earth and our separateness from them; and, above all, our hearts get into their proper place, for, being set on Jesus Himself, we are waiting for Him.<a name=322:16></a> When He shall appear, we shall appear with Him in glory, but we shall be for ever with the Lord.<a name=322:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I feel, beloved brethren, that the very commencement of this chapter comforts one in a particular manner in connection with the exceeding solemnity of the address to the church of Sardis.<a name=323:2></a> I know of nothing more solemn than the point of view from which the Spirit of God, in this address to Sardis, regards the professing church, as to its name, its character, and its responsibility in the world; for, while the address is to the church, the point of view from whence it is looked at is what the Son of God is in His own fulness of blessing; since it ought to be, in the power of divine grace, the expression of His nature and power, from whom its life flows; and it is necessarily addressed to the professing church, according to the professed position it has taken.<a name=323:3></a> I feel ever a little difficulty in speaking on the subject, because of the sense of responsibility that presses on me; and I pray the Lord may communicate to you the sense I have (nay, and a much greater sense than I have) of the responsibility connected with it.<a name=323:4></a> The church of Sardis was, indeed, in a most solemn condition.<a name=323:5></a> Still there is a comfort in the fulness and perfectness of Christ here given for the need of the church; and, when all else might seem to fail, so much the more does Christ bring out that unchangeable fulness which is always there in Him to be depended on.<a name=323:6></a>

		The Lord's character (which, as I have before said, is usual in these addresses) is adapted to the state of those whom He is addressing -- "these things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars.<a name=323:7></a>" It is not said here, as it is in the address to Ephesus, "He that holdeth in his right hand the seven stars"; but "he that hath the seven stars.<a name=323:8></a>" And, mark, that no word in Scripture is omitted or changed without full meaning.<a name=323:9></a> The stars (the angels<a href="#323:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>) of the seven churches

		But here in Sardis, failure, and even spiritual death, had come in, and characterised the state of the church -- "I know thy works, that thou hast a name, that thou livest and art dead.<a name=324:3></a>" We have seen how failure and decay had already previously got into the church; but Sardis was, in one point of view, in a worse state than even any before her, having a name to live while she was dead.<a name=324:4></a> It was decay of vital power -- not the power of evil working, but a morally worn out thing; and consequently the Lord presented Himself to Sardis as having for faith all the fulness<a href="#324:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> of the Holy Ghost at His disposal -- "He that hath the seven Spirits of God"; and the seven stars, all power in the church, were at His disposal also (seven being the symbol of perfection.<a name=324:5></a>)

	<div class="paragraph">
		Whatever the failure of the church may be, however it may have coalesced with the world, this remains always true, that the full, divine competency of the Holy Ghost in His various attributes, is its portion, under Him who is the Head of the church and cares for it, and loves it, and watches over it; so that the church is without excuse, on one hand, and the believing saint has a resource on the other.<a name=324:6></a> But now that the whole thing had completely failed, that not only God's saints were seduced by the false doctrine of Balaam, and that Jezebel had found a home there, having children born there (as of Zion it shall be said, "This and that man were born in her," so here there were those who had their Christian name and birth-place in the very evil itself): another scene presents itself here after the evil has fully developed itself -- a deathful state, though all spiritual energy and authoritative power is there in Christ Himself, with whom they have to do.<a name=324:7></a> And much as the fact of all this being still and ever in Christ may condemn the professing church, the precious truth of all power

		Whatever may be the form in which corruption has come in, be it Jezebel or be it Balaam, the Lord says, "I know it all.<a name=325:3></a>" If death is stamped on the professing church, still Christ says, "I have the seven Spirits of God, and nothing can touch this"; and, therefore, while all is going wrong, we find that He has still all that is needed for the full blessing of the church -- "hath the seven Spirits of God.<a name=325:4></a>" This is not altered a bit, either by the failure of man or by the wickedness of Satan.<a name=325:5></a>

		In <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#4:5">Revelation  4:5</a>, and chapter 5:6, we have likewise mention of the seven Spirits of God -- seven lamps of fire burning; seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, expressive of multiform power and manifold wisdom; so that it is as if the Lord had said, "Here is everything that can produce good, and secure good, and I have it all in My keeping.<a name=325:6></a>" In Thyatira He had been obliged to teach them to look out for His coming as the only refuge in the midst of evil; and this hope is brought in as the bright and morning star, to light up the soul in the midst of surrounding darkness.<a name=325:7></a> Then, in the church of Sardis, where they had a name to live when they were dead, He further comforts the faithful ones with the assurance, that, as to the real source of all strength, there is not any failure.<a name=325:8></a> If all outward supply is gone, He is still the same, and now He will make this known to the church as the power to sustain and support the faithful few; but He does not work a miracle for their deliverance.<a name=325:9></a> So likewise, we may observe, when Israel set up the golden calf, there was no miracle wrought to meet that failure, but there was spiritual power in Moses, when he put the tabernacle outside the camp.<a name=325:10></a>

		Take for instance, the apostle Paul; how entirely he got above the position of the failing Corinthians and Galatians when he got up to the spring of confidence in the Lord.<a name=326:7></a> See how shockingly the Corinthians had been going on when Paul wrote to them.<a name=326:8></a> There was "such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles.<a name=326:9></a>" Therefore he had to reprove them, but he looked above their actual state to the source of their life and hope; and, therefore, before he touches upon their evil, he can speak to them of their being "confirmed unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ"; for "God is faithful by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=326:10></a>" So also to the Galatians.<a name=326:11></a> When Paul wrote to them he said, "I stand in doubt of you"; for they had got under the law, and, therefore, Paul asks, must he change his voice -- wants to know how he should speak to them; for they were off the Christian ground of grace, and, accordingly, he turns to speak to them according to the law.<a name=326:12></a> But when he gets up to Christ, then his heart gets to the spring of confidence -- not confidence in

		Mark, then, the graciousness of the Lord, in the way in which He opens this address to Sardis.<a name=327:4></a> Before He touches on their terrible state, He first of all presents Himself as still possessing the plenary power of the Spirit, for the resource of faith; so that, notwithstanding all the failure and evil that had come in, the power and prevalency of the Spirit still remained the same, because it depended not upon the walk of the saint down here, but upon the value of Christ's work above.<a name=327:5></a> Just as God spake to Israel of old when they had failed, by the mouth of Haggai the prophet, saying, "According to the word which I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, so my Spirit remaineth among you; fear ye not.<a name=327:6></a>" And so it is here -- "These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars.<a name=327:7></a>" Then He goes on to take up the state of the church -- "I know thy works that thou hast a name, that thou livest and art dead.<a name=327:8></a>" What a terrible condition is this!<a name=327:9></a> It completely portrays what we see all around us -- I do not mean only at the present day, but what has actually been the state of the church for the last century and more.<a name=327:10></a>

		We would here point out what very different aspects of the Lord's coming we have presented to us in these addresses.<a name=336:8></a> In Thyatira, in the Jezebel state of the church, He turns away the eye from all hope of its restoration as a whole, and turns it to the Morning Star for the comfort of those who, though not of the night, yet feeling that it is the night, are watching for the Morning Star; thus presenting the hope of His coming as a refuge to the faithful overcomer in the midst of abounding evil.<a name=336:9></a> Here in Sardis His coming has the character of judgment -- "I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know at what hour I will come on thee.<a name=336:10></a>" Sardis, being in a decayed dead state, necessarily brings a judgment on itself; for if the professing church be got into a state like the dead, then it must be treated like the dead.<a name=336:11></a> But in Philadelphia, it is quite a different thing; there He addresses a poor, feeble remnant in the midst of apostasy, with the blessed and encouraging hope of His coming quickly -- "Behold, I come <i>quickly</i>.<a name=336:12></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		Philadelphia.<a name=336:13></a> We have seen the general course of the first of these churches to be declension; then the being drawn away by Satan; then warnings.<a name=336:14></a> Here a remnant are comforted.<a name=336:15></a> What characterises the faithful here is, that while they had no strength, they are yet in close connection with the Lord Jesus Christ Himself.<a name=336:16></a> What characterises the father in Christ, in John's first epistle, is the knowledge of Him that is from the beginning.<a name=336:17></a> So here in Philadelphia, we get a little strength, it is true; but there is no denial of His name.<a name=336:18></a> The address to the church, the foundation of the declaration made to it, is connected with Christ, is Himself; it is not a question of power.<a name=336:19></a> But when all is going wrong, as in John's epistle, where there were the many Antichrists, still there were those who had

		Remark, too, that the characters of Christ presented here form no part of the original glory of Christ, spoken of in chapter 1, but refer to His moral character, discerned by the saint exercised in faith at the epoch to which the church refers.<a name=337:9></a> But the saints here had "kept the word of Christ's patience"; and when the word of God is valued as such, then the character of Christ Himself governs the soul.<a name=337:10></a> His precepts become our authority, and Christ Himself personally rules the affections of the heart, and with a single eye the body is full of light.<a name=337:11></a> So it was with Mary, when the departure of the Lord drew nigh.<a name=337:12></a> The word of God links the soul with Christ as He was, and is; it just gives one a <i>written Christ</i>.<a name=337:13></a> See in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#5">Matthew  5</a>"Blessed are the poor in spirit"; and who so poor in spirit as Christ?<a name=337:14></a> "Blessed are the pure in heart"; and who so pure as He?<a name=337:15></a> "Blessed are the meek"; and who so meek as He?<a name=337:16></a> "Blessed are the peace-makers": He was the great peacemaker, the very Prince of peace.<a name=337:17></a>

		The first thing, of course, is to have Him as the living Christ for the salvation of the soul; and then, through the written word, we get the spiritual perception of what this Christ is.<a name=337:18></a> It is the simple expression of Christ Himself, of Him who was the express image of God; who "was made flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.<a name=337:19></a>"

		Of course we must wait the Lord's time to have the door opened; as we see in the case of Paul, he was forbidden to speak in Asia, at one time, and then we find him there for three years afterwards, the Lord owning his labours there, so that all Asia (of which Ephesus, where he was gathering a church, was the capital) heard the word of God.<a name=339:5></a> Of course we shall have to be content to lean in faith on the arm of Him who holds the key, and in our patience we shall have to possess our souls; for there will always be circumstances to exercise our faith, and God will allow these circumstances to arise, to prove to us that we cannot do without Him.<a name=339:6></a> For then it is we find that we have no strength, and that God answers our weakness according to His own strength; because He cannot fail to answer the faith He has given.<a name=339:7></a> "I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it.<a name=339:8></a>" This word has often given me great confidence -- "no man can shut it.<a name=339:9></a>" This is such a blessed comfort that if Christ has opened a door, no man, devil, or wicked spirit, can shut it; and although we have not strength even to push the door open, it is open for us.<a name=339:10></a> The whole church is weak, as weak as can be, and that in a bad sense, for what faith have we?<a name=339:11></a> We hear of a little faith.<a name=339:12></a> God shews us His power, as we have heard of in Madagascar.<a name=339:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We only touched a little upon the general features of the church of Philadelphia last evening, just so much as was needful to connect it with the preceding church of Sardis.<a name=343:1></a> We will, therefore, now turn again, the Lord helping us, to consider more particularly the details of the church of Philadelphia; and in so doing, we would notice, in the first place, that the most prominent feature in this church of Philadelphia is, that it is one of special blessing to meet a special need.<a name=343:2></a> For, after all the display of terrible evil through which we have had to pass, in the previous condition of the churches, now that we have reached Philadelphia, we find it to be all mercy and blessing.<a name=343:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is very blessed to observe, that however poor and feeble God's people may be, even though the faithful ones be reduced to a remnant of individuals, He never forgets them.<a name=343:4></a> His eye is ever upon them to give them out of His own resources, according to what they need and when they need, at the time that surrounding things are darkest.<a name=343:5></a> When both the church and the world have arrived at a state of felt darkness, then the few who are faithful have the most "light in the Lord.<a name=343:6></a>" For the life of faith is always nourished and sustained by the faithful grace of Christ, according to the power of that which draws upon it -- according to the difficulties through which it has to pass.<a name=343:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is another question whether the Lord's people are to be used in testimony by Him in time of failure; this will be according to His wisdom.<a name=343:8></a> We see this exemplified (as we have before remarked) in Israel; the failure of the golden calf was met by inward spiritual power in Moses putting the tabernacle outside the camp.<a name=343:9></a> And when the open and avowed worship of Baal prevailed, then God raised up Elijah and Elisha with great outward manifestation of power; but then the seven thousand faithful ones were hidden of God.<a name=343:10></a> The Lord may not choose to put the outward honour of testimony upon that which has failed.<a name=343:11></a> Still He gives the needed grace and inward power of life to sustain the individual soul; and this, as regards the saints now, flowing from the Head in glory for the nourishment of the body on the earth, can never fail.<a name=343:12></a> Thus, as regards gifts in the church, for instance, those which were for signs ("sign-gifts" as they are sometimes called,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=344>[Page 344]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and a testimony to the world, signs being for those which believe not, as "tongues," "gifts of healing," etc.<a name=344:1></a>), these may be all gone; but never can those gifts be removed which flow down from the Head to sustain the members of the body; for "no man ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the Lord the church.<a name=344:2></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the epistle to the Ephesians, where the church is so specially brought out as the body of Christ, we find the gifts for the church spoken of as being "for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ.<a name=344:3></a>" Here we have not a word about the sign-gifts, while in Corinthians we have "gifts of healing," "divers kind of tongues," "interpretation of tongues," etc.<a name=344:4></a> Thus we see in Scripture two characters of gifts distinctly marked out: first, the sign-gifts, as in Corinthians, which were public signs attached to the church for outward testimony, whereby to attract an unbelieving world; secondly, those gifts which flow from the Head for the nourishment of the body.<a name=344:5></a> This nourishment must ever remain.<a name=344:6></a> It may come in the way of outward testimony, or direct from Christ Himself in the way of grace; but there must always be this supply from the Head.<a name=344:7></a> This is just what we get brought out in the Philadelphian church; for that which characterised it was weakness -- only a little power, but a much greater nearness to Him who is power, a greater degree of affection to the Lord, more intimacy of communion with Him, and in the promises made to it a much more definite identification with Himself.<a name=344:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Weakness is that which characterised the church of Philadelphia, but then it was without reproach from the Lord.<a name=344:9></a> And we must ever remember this, that though God may give an outward display of power, such as gifts of healing, tongues, and the like, as a testimony to the world, or these may all have come to an end, yet at all times, either with or without this outward manifestation of power, the sense of weakness is competent strength if mixed with faith.<a name=344:10></a> There may be trouble of heart along with this sense of weakness without unbelief.<a name=344:11></a> There was this sense of the surrounding sorrow in the Lord Jesus.<a name=344:12></a> "Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say?<a name=344:13></a> Father, save me from this hour.<a name=344:14></a>" But thus we see the sorrow was the very thing which immediately linked Him with His Father.<a name=344:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, alas!<a name=344:16></a> in us there is too often such a getting into communion
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=345>[Page 345]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		with the sorrow itself, such a turning of our souls to the thoughts of sorrow, as to lead to the distrusting God's competency to meet it.<a name=345:1></a> For, instead of saying, "In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul," we are turning about in the multitude of our thoughts to think what is to be done, and thus looking at and occupying ourselves about circumstances, or what we find within us, so as to keep God out altogether; but this was never the case with the Lord Jesus.<a name=345:2></a> For the moment the hour of sorrow appeared before His soul, the immediate cry was, "Father, save me from this hour.<a name=345:3></a>" But if we are thinking about our own weakness in any other way than to lead us to immediate dependence upon the strength of God, God with us and God for us, it is unbelief.<a name=345:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not, moreover, a sense of the greatness of God's gifts and revelations to us in which our strength lies.<a name=345:5></a> For signs and miracles do not give inward strength; they may confirm His word to us in times of trial, but can never impart inward strength; and it is of importance clearly to understand this.<a name=345:6></a> Take, for instance, the case of Paul, who was caught up into the third heaven, and heard there things which it was not possible for him to utter.<a name=345:7></a> An amazing thing this, and doubtless it was a kind of background for Paul's soul to rest upon in his trials, his having been in the third heaven.<a name=345:8></a> But it did not give him inward strength.<a name=345:9></a> On the contrary, the flesh, without God's overruling care, would have been puffed up, and this is not strength; but when he got something that made him sensible of his own weakness, then strength from God could come in.<a name=345:10></a> And so it is with us: our hearts are so treacherous, and our flesh so wicked, that if not watched against, we should abuse everything that the Lord makes known to us.<a name=345:11></a> We need not stop here to enquire what Paul's "thorn in the flesh" was, although it is often made the subject of much fruitless enquiry, out of mere curiosity; but this we would remark, that each one of us will have a different thorn according to the danger we are in.<a name=345:12></a> Thus much we know from <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#4:13">Galatians  4:13</a>, 14, that it was something which tended to make him despicable in the flesh, thus producing sensible weakness in his ministry.<a name=345:13></a> And, therefore, Paul cried thrice to the Lord to remove it; to which the Lord replied, "My grace is sufficient for thee; for my strength is made perfect in weakness.<a name=345:14></a>" Paul must realise this sense of weakness in order to learn where real
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
		strength lies; and then he can glory in his infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon him; as he says, "When I am weak, then am I strong.<a name=346:1></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is always strength in looking to God; but if the mind rest upon the weakness otherwise than to cast it upon God, it becomes unbelief.<a name=346:2></a> Difficulties may come in.<a name=346:3></a> God may allow many things to arise to prove our weakness; but the simple path of faith is to go on, not looking beforehand at what we have to do, but reckoning upon the help that we shall need, and find when the time arrives.<a name=346:4></a> The sense that we are nothing makes us glad to forget ourselves, and then it is that Christ becomes everything to the soul.<a name=346:5></a> There is real strength in pursuing the simple path of obedience in what we may have to do, whatever the trial may be.<a name=346:6></a> So it was with David when he had to fight.<a name=346:7></a> "The Lord, that delivered me out of the paw of the bear, and out of the paw of the lion, will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine.<a name=346:8></a>" It was no matter to David whether it was the lion, the bear, or this giant of the Philistines; it was all the same to him, for in himself he was as weak in the presence of one as the other; but he went on quietly doing his duty, taking it for granted that God would be with him.<a name=346:9></a> <i>This is faith</i>.<a name=346:10></a> Mark the contrast with this in the unbelief of the spies sent by Moses to spy out the land.<a name=346:11></a> They trembled and said they were but as grasshoppers in the sight of their enemies, thus quite forgetting what God was for them, and making it a question between themselves and the Anakims, instead of between the Anakims and God.<a name=346:12></a> But where there is a simple reference to the Lord, then "I can do all things through Christ strengthening me.<a name=346:13></a>" When trouble comes in, we must not be looking at ourselves, but, knowing that we are nothing but weakness, simply look to the Lord as everything in the way of strength for us.<a name=346:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The case of Philadelphia was one of decided weakness, but faithfulness; there may be great apparent power and yet weakness itself.<a name=346:15></a> As the Holy Ghost says in 1 Corinthians, there may be the speaking with the tongues of men and angels, the understanding of all mysteries, and all knowledge, and yet there may be, at the same time, the most perfect weakness, because all this was not done in communion with God.<a name=346:16></a> There is nothing more dangerous than to have the outward manifestation of power going beyond the inward association and communion of soul with God; the life within must be equal to

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the outward display of power.<a name=347:1></a> We have lately alluded to this in the case of Elijah.<a name=347:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"These things saith he that is holy, he that is true.<a name=347:3></a>" Here in Philadelphia we have the Lord in His moral character, and not in the character of personal power as the Son of God, but as the "holy and the true," presenting Himself as a standard of judgment as to everything inconsistent with Himself, and suiting Himself in grace to the condition and need of His faithful ones, and by His truth giving a means of judgment, and security of heart and confidence to the saints.<a name=347:4></a> And we also find Him disposing of means in favour of the church, in such a way that, if He opens a door, none can shut it, or if He shuts a door, none can open it.<a name=347:5></a> Thus there are the two things: He is the holy and the true, to those who trust in Him; and He has also, not here indeed the display of power, but the key of power (as Jehovah said of Eliakim to Shebna in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#22:22">Isaiah  22:22</a>: "The key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder, so he shall open and none shall shut, and he shall shut and none shall open").<a name=347:6></a> So that, where there is this weakness, He encourages the church to look to Himself as the holy and the true, and trust Him; and where there is this resting on His title to open and shut, and this trust in His Person, and conformity to His character, the church is perfectly secure, no matter what may happen.<a name=347:7></a> Let all the power of man or Satan do their worst, if I am resting in Christ, who is perfectly true, and He has opened a door, neither man nor devil can shut it.<a name=347:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How analogous is this position of the Philadelphian church to that of Christ when He was on the earth!<a name=347:9></a> Everybody sought to shut the door against Him; Pilate, Herod, Scribes, Pharisees, and the whole nation of the Jews were all trying to shut the door against Christ.<a name=347:10></a> Christ, like the Philadelphian church, was in the midst of an order of things which God had once instituted, but which had entirely failed; for in Christ's time there was no ark, no Urim and Thummim, no Shechinah (the glory of God's presence in the temple).<a name=347:11></a> All that had really constituted the sensible display of power and testimony was gone, and, instead of Jehovah having a throne in Jerusalem, they themselves had fallen under Gentile power and were slaves to man's throne.<a name=347:12></a> And hence arose the exceeding subtlety of the question the Jews put to our Lord.<a name=347:13></a> "What thinkest thou?<a name=347:14></a> Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar or not?<a name=347:15></a>" If the Lord had answered No, it would have been the denial of
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=348>[Page 348]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God's chastisement for their sins; and if He had said Yes, then it went to the denial of His title as Messiah.<a name=348:1></a> But (the Lord perceiving their wickedness), His reply to them amounted to this, "You have brought yourselves under this dominion because of your sins, and therefore now you must submit to its authority.<a name=348:2></a>" Not only "the powers that be are ordained of God," and as such we submit to them; but in Israel's case it would have been denying God's chastisement upon them for their sins (as it is said, "we are slaves this day because of our sins").<a name=348:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the Lord Himself submitted to paying the temple tribute.<a name=348:4></a> But though Israel, as a body, failed in their faithfulness to God, yet God could not fail in His faithfulness to them, for His Spirit remained among them, as we learn in Haggai; and therefore we find there was a little remnant in the Annas and Simeons, who were waiting for redemption in Israel (as it is said in Malachi, "They that feared the Lord spake often one to another").<a name=348:5></a> Thus we see it was a condition of thorough darkness, and when He who was the Light comes in, He is at once rejected.<a name=348:6></a> Well, what then?<a name=348:7></a> Was the door shut to Him?<a name=348:8></a> <i>No</i>: "to him the porter openeth.<a name=348:9></a>" Christ came in at the door, not, like all the pretenders that came before Him, climbing up some other way; but while working in divine power Christ came in by God's own appointed way, and no man could shut it.<a name=348:10></a> He is become God's appointed way to us; He said of Himself, "I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved.<a name=348:11></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Whatever links our position with Christ, as an example and pattern, is in truth a blessing to us; for was there ever one that went through all with such unfailing, lowly faithfulness to God as He did?<a name=348:12></a> Note the contrast of His lowly path with that of Elijah's; and what do we see?<a name=348:13></a> Elijah was going on ministering with great outward power, bringing down fire from heaven to destroy the prophets of Baal, and thinking himself to be the only one that was left that was true to God; whereas God had seven thousand that had not bowed the knee to Baal, whom Elijah had not found out.<a name=348:14></a> Christ was content to be nothing in a world where man was everything and God was shut out.<a name=348:15></a> He was content to be treated as the very offscouring of the earth; and yet, at the same time, there was not a single lost sheep of the house of Israel that His voice did not reach as the voice of the good Shepherd (let them be the

		remember, that what is before us in all these churches is not the work of God's grace in itself; for these addresses to the churches would have no place if it were -- nor yet Christ the Head of the body, as the source of grace to the members -- nor yet is it the work of the Spirit of God, as that of course is never the subject of judgment; as also the grace which flows down from the Head to the members can never fail.<a name=363:1></a> This can never be the subject either of warnings or threatenings.<a name=363:2></a> It is the condition and state of the church which is here shewn forth, as holding the place of responsibility under the eye of God, and the consequent dealings of Christ with it, in the expectation of fruit.<a name=363:3></a>

		It is not then the supply of the Spirit of grace from the Head, nor yet the directions through the Spirit of the Father's love dealing with the children within, because that supposes the church to be in an accepted and healthy state, and gives them directions suited to that state, and answering to the purpose for which it was called into church position.<a name=363:6></a> In Laodicea there is that which cannot apply to individuals; you may give warning to individuals in the church of God, "while the simple pass on and are punished.<a name=363:7></a>" But this is not mere warning; excision is announced, and that can never apply to a saint of God.<a name=363:8></a> "Because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.<a name=363:9></a>" It is the excision of the external professing body, which bears the name of the church, as such.<a name=363:10></a> This leads us to see the important truth of the responsibility of the professing church of God on the earth; therefore it is I am so glad of this opportunity of going over again the general principles connected with this.<a name=363:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Philadelphia, Christ was not known in the same character in which He was known in Thyatira, as "Son over his own house," but fresh traits of His character were to be seized by the church for its particular need.<a name=364:3></a> From the same period of time, and even before, that is, from the time of the complete corruption of its original standing, the coming of the Lord is held out to the church.<a name=364:4></a> The saint could no longer occupy himself with the hope of the restoration of the church as a professing whole, and therefore the coming of the Lord is placed before it as its only resource, that the faithful remnant might look out for Him, finding in Christ that which they could lean upon and trust in, when the outward ground was slipping from under their feet.<a name=364:5></a> Those who had special faith in Jesus could not float on with the common stream of the thoughts of the church; for if they did, they would find themselves with Jezebel, or with Sardis, having a name to live and yet dead.<a name=364:6></a> Faith has need to be sustained in a peculiar manner, in order to keep me from the seductions of the "synagogue of Satan.<a name=364:7></a>" Common grace will do when the church itself is in its place, but <i>uncommon</i> grace is needed to sustain the faithful when the church is not keeping its place.<a name=364:8></a> If Jezebel be there, I cannot go on with common faith; Christ and falsehood cannot go on together.<a name=364:9></a> If it be a name to live, being dead, I must have something special to sustain the life in me.<a name=364:10></a> Therefore, whether it be Jezebel seducing,<a href="#364:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> or Babylon corrupting, or Laodicea going to be spued out, I could not go on content with the moral state of things.<a name=364:11></a> Therefore I should need special grace suited to it, discerned by spiritual-mindedness alone, not being the natural relationship between Christ and the church as such.<a name=364:12></a> Of course we at all times need the

		Now here, though the professing church still subsists in form, yet it is utterly rejected, and it is unconditionally declared that Christ will spue it out of His mouth.<a name=365:4></a> The judgment is not accomplished, but it is certain and assumed as such.<a name=365:5></a> And the reason why the coming of the Lord is dropped after Philadelphia is, that, the whole thing being morally gone and the subject of judgment, the Lord presents Himself as outside in Laodicea, "Behold, I stand at the door and knock.<a name=365:6></a>" If there are still saints within, the testimony to them is as from without the scene of which they make a part.<a name=365:7></a> In Philadelphia, all dealing with the saints as maintaining them in a place of testimony is closed; for the professing church had then become either Jezebel in corruption, or Sardis in death, so that it should be judged as the world; and the remnant had the testimony as keeping the word of Christ's patience, and are comforted by the assurance that Christ will come quickly.<a name=365:8></a> Now they were to be content with the assurance that then the synagogue of Satan would know that Christ had loved them.<a name=365:9></a>

		He says, "Surely, I come quickly"; to which the church responds, "Even so, come, Lord Jesus.<a name=366:1></a>" Thus it is very evident that the coming of the Lord to take the church unto Himself, must be something entirely between Himself and the church alone.<a name=366:2></a> But it will not be so with the remnant of Israel, for them the execution of the judgment will be needed, in order to their taking their place in the earth.<a name=366:3></a> In fact, the Lord's coming to the earth itself must be attended with the execution of judgment, gathering out of His "kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity.<a name=366:4></a>" And it is evident that the deliverance of the remnant of Israel connects the coming of the Lord with the execution of judgment upon what despises Him before Israel can possibly get their blessing.<a name=366:5></a> And this accounts for the strong cry of vengeance we find throughout the Psalms; take <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#94">Psalm  94</a>for instance, "O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongeth, shew thyself.<a name=366:6></a>" Now we do not want vengeance in order to be with Christ in blessing.<a name=366:7></a> God has given us grace as our portion in every way, and we have to deal entirely with grace.<a name=366:8></a> I am not looking for the Lord to come and avenge me on my enemies, for I am expecting to be caught up to meet Him in the air.<a name=366:9></a> And, that it may be clearly understood, I would again remark, that throughout the whole Scriptures this cry, in connection with the Lord's coming to the earth, is the language of the remnant of Israel, and not the language of the church of God.<a name=366:10></a>

		The reader of the "Lectures" will remember, that he is not to expect in any case to find the active energy of the Spirit of God which produces the blessing of the church, but the form or condition of the professing church after that energy has been in operation and man's responsibility comes into play.<a name=380:4></a> There may be a measure of blessing, or great culpability.<a name=380:5></a> But the energy of the Holy Ghost cannot be the object of judgment.<a name=380:6></a>

		The first church indeed shews the decline of the saints from the first condition of blessing, produced by the power of the Holy Ghost.<a name=380:7></a> This sufficiently indicates the epoch to which it refers, while it characterises, in a general way, the result for the whole professing church, as a system established by God in this world, as a light in the world (and as such the church is considered here); not in its safety as the true living body of Christ, according to the power of redemption secured by the unfailing power of Christ.<a name=380:8></a>

		This soon paved the way for putting the church into tribulation (for a limited time, however).<a name=381:5></a> The poor of the flock, the faithful ones, would be subject to injurious accusations from those professing to have established claims to be God's people, and persecution from without.<a name=381:6></a> This characterised the church.<a name=381:7></a> This state lasted from Nero to Diocletian.<a name=381:8></a>

		It seems to me that the examination of the great principles which God has brought out in His ways, in the history given us in the Bible, would facilitate the intelligence of His ultimate dealings with men and the understanding their prophetic announcements, the accomplishment of which will be the establishment in power of the principles which God has already displayed and taught historically in His dealings of old.<a name=383:1></a> I send you therefore some thoughts upon the progressive development of these principles.<a name=383:2></a> In the very outset of creation we have one of the last importance, and which gives in figure the ultimate results of God's ways in His dispensations towards men, a kind of exhibition that what begins in thought is to be the end in action.<a name=383:3></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#389:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>I say for the time, because it is evident that the age in which Christ was upon earth (though suspended, so to speak, to let in the heavenly body, the bride the church) is not closed, and will be resumed in the dealings of God with the Jews and the kings of the earth, who stand up against the Lord and His anointed, and, as is evident to me, before the manifestation of the Son of man. Meanwhile, the apostasy of professing Christendom will have taken place; and it is the putting this and the Jewish state of things in their place which creates the chief difficulty of interpretation, because it is the developing, in point of time, of two different systems, which unite, however, in their rejection of God and His Christ. Patient waiting upon God will clear up this, as all else revealed in the word. The death of Stephen and calling of Paul, and the rapture of the church, are the boundaries of the time of full light in standing before God. I do not speak of man's profiting by the light, but of his position.

		<a class="footnote" name="#391:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>There are two kinds of prophecy in the Old Testament: prophecy addressed to the conscience of God's people while owned, or at least subsisting as such; prophecy revealing God's ways when He no longer owned His people. Daniel is the example of the latter. His prophecy is not addressed to Israel. The former kind of prophecy does not occur in the New Testament in the church, because the occasion of it had ceased. The church was united to Christ in heaven, and the character of communication was to the members of His body enjoying unity with Him by the Holy Ghost; it calls for what suited that; and the coming of Christ was the object of highest affection where there was no failure, but He was possessed, not prophesied of. The second character of prophecy, confided to the church but not addressing it, is found in the Revelation, and depicts a time in which God would deal with the world of which the church was not. Israel has its place in the sum of prophecy which is necessarily the earth, and hence was addressed in it; the church has not. Hence the character of the Lord's prophecies. They address the disciples in this condition, and, though more simple and intimate in their nature, as we might suppose, partake of the character just spoken of in reference to prophetic addresses to Israel.
