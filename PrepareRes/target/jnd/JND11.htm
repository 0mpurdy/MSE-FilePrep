		REMARKS ON THREE TRACTS ENTITLED "SIGNS OF THE COMING OF THE LORD: FOR WHOM ARE THEY GIVEN?"

		I should not, I confess, have felt it needful, nor, under the circumstances of their publication, desirable, to answer the three tracts of which the statements are here called in question, had they appeared supported only by their intrinsic merit.<a name=1:1></a> I understand the effect in an upright mind of an appeal to a righteous jealousy against error, especially error which is stated to shake the foundation of Christian faith.<a name=1:2></a> Still the confusion and futility of the statements, I should have hoped, would have sufficed for their refutation in the mind of the reader; but they are in fact the expression of the sentiments and the sanctioned publication of those whose opinions are looked up to by many, and come with their authority.<a name=1:3></a> It is this induces me, though reluctantly, to publish these remarks upon them.<a name=1:4></a> It is a most wearying thing -- controversy.<a name=1:5></a> And I have had the MS by me weeks before I could make up my mind to publish it.<a name=1:6></a> I do so as owing it to those whose minds are influenced by the tracts, and who have asked for an answer.<a name=1:7></a> They were mentioned indeed to me originally by a brother to comment on, which led to the form of the answer -- a form in general I dislike.<a name=1:8></a> Here it was the simple truth of the case; though, when written, I publish instead of sending it in manuscript.<a name=1:9></a>

		My Dear Brother, <p>I have read the tract you mentioned to me.<a name=1:10></a> I shall not express to you the effect it produced on my mind, as I should fear to be ungracious or untrue if I attempted it.<a name=1:11></a> I should not judge it demanded a comment, were it not the expression of a system adopted by many, and that this tract helps to prove on what very slender grounds.<a name=1:12></a> I am yet unconvinced by the reasonings I have heard and read on Matthew 24; and, while

		I recognise, as I have ever done, in this chapter and elsewhere, that the church may use a great part of it for itself, as general principles, that it would have availed preciously to the disciples in the siege of Jerusalem, though Luke much more, and that all of it belongs (as everything does) to the church in general for her instruction, yet I still believe that it is not occupied with her as such.<a name=2:1></a> Nay, with I trust very moderate views, and open to receive every instruction from any brother on the subject, I confess that the more I read the Scriptures, and the more I read the writings of those who so stoutly denounce views which, it seems to me, they do not understand at all, the more I am convinced of certain distinctions they seem to me to be unable to appreciate, though they loudly condemn; and the more also I see such inattention to Scripture facts, and contradiction in their own statements as quite destroys all possibility of what they state having much weight with any one who examines calmly anything before he receives it.<a name=2:2></a> Other opportunities will occur of examining the subject more at large.<a name=2:3></a> Meanwhile, I shall take up this tract on the "Signs of the Coming of the Lord," that we may see, in some very brief remarks, how far the writer is justified, by the solidity of his reasonings, or the proofs he affords of their importance, in charging (as others also have done) brethren (some of whom have suffered for Christ, and preached the truth for years before he knew Christ or the truth either) with "subverting the first elements of Christianity.<a name=2:4></a>"

		First, in attacking the expression of Jews as Jews, he is, it seems to me, saying a great deal about nothing.<a name=2:5></a> All his first letter, which treats of this, is a mere harmless thunderbolt.<a name=2:6></a> It would have been as much to the purpose, when Paul says, I write to you Gentiles inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, to have shewn the dreadfulness of addressing heathens in such a way, seeing heathens were idolaters, and judgment come upon the world and the like, all which would be entirely beside the mark, and prove only that those who made the remark did not understand the generic or abstract use of the word Gentile, as the writer of the tract does not that of Jew.<a name=2:7></a> A Jew who believed in Jesus might be addressed in his character of Jew, as a Gentile in that of a Gentile.<a name=2:8></a> It is possible that some of our brethren have not been as guarded or as perfect in their expressions as the blessed Spirit made Paul; but it does not follow that those who attack them are wiser or more

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I still believe that Matthew 24, at least to verse 31, is addressed to the disciples as Jews, as believing Jews no doubt, but as Jews; and the more I examine it the more I think so; and I do not think it addressed to the church as the church.<a name=3:2></a> Nothing indeed was addressed to the church by the Lord in Person, because the church did not yet exist to be addressed; though all was left for the church to use by the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven.<a name=3:3></a><a href="#3:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The writer insists much upon the expression -- "this generation," "no sign shall be given to this generation but the sign of Jonas the prophet," connected with the statement "this generation shall not pass away," etc.<a name=3:4></a>, and that consequently signs were not to be given to the Jews as such.<a name=3:5></a> This seems to catch him much.<a name=3:6></a> To me it has no weight at all.<a name=3:7></a> I admit the moral unity of "this generation" in Matthew 24.<a name=3:8></a> It is an interpretation long accepted and taught by those who are blamed in this tract.<a name=3:9></a> Still his reasoning is wrong and contradicts itself.<a name=3:10></a> It is clear first, as to the passage, chapter 12: 38-45, that the Lord was speaking of signs as proofs of His mission, and not of coming judgment.<a name=3:11></a> In chapter 16: 1-4 they are accused of not discerning the signs of the times that were then before them.<a name=3:12></a> But no sign could be given them from the Lord but the sign of the prophet Jonas for the ground of their faith.<a name=3:13></a> But these signs spoken of were still signs as grounds of faith.<a name=3:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next, the greater part of the signs spoken of in Matthew 24 are not given to the disciples, the only one that is so given being absolutely inapplicable in any case to the church in

		<a class="footnote" name="#3:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>It must be remembered that all the gospels were given by subsequent revelation to the church of God: but it is for the church of God to discern by the teaching of the Holy Ghost what was for ever and essentially available for itself, what was for the disciples in the state in which they then were, and what was prophetic of some future state of things. This is not to take anything from the church. It is not, and cannot be, denied that there are passages which apply to the disciples in their then state, and not to the present state of the church. So that the principle of some passages not applying is admitted; and therefore to say that the supposition that in certain other passages the Lord speaks prophetically of certain events beyond the church's history, is taking the gospels from the church, is quite an unreasonable accusation. It is merely denying spiritual discernment to the church of God -- to say that it cannot judge of what was for the disciples then, what is for itself now, and what may be prophetic of some future state of things.

		general, or to any but a very small portion indeed, at a particular moment of time, namely the inhabitants of Jerusalem and its neighbourhood at the moment of Antichrist's open rebellion.<a name=4:1></a> The body of the church must have expected Christ without this, or not expected Him at all.<a name=4:2></a> But believers in Christ, he says, "have a series of signs given to them, commencing with the one sign refused by the nation, and closed by a host of unprecedented distinctness, immediately preceding, and introducing, the great sign itself, the sign of the Son of man in the clouds of heaven.<a name=4:3></a>" Now, omitting Jonas and the resurrection, which is not mentioned here, and is entirely another kind of sign, and on another principle, and the unnamed series which is only a flourish, the signs of "unprecedented distinctness" are not given to the disciples as such.<a name=4:4></a> Indeed they are already, according to his own system, fled.<a name=4:5></a> And I suppose that he does not deny that these terrific signs are seen by, and a sign to, the nation.<a name=4:6></a> At any rate the great sign itself is clearly given as such: "Then shall appear, etc.<a name=4:7></a>, and they shall see.<a name=4:8></a>" So that it ends in the appearing of Christ making the tribes of the earth mourn, Christianity being gone far away three years and a half before,<a href="#4:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> and the harvest even over, having taken place elsewhere; so that, on his own shewing, in all this he is certainly wrong.<a name=4:9></a> That this is a provision for all whom it may concern, who believe and receive the testimony, I do not deny.<a name=4:10></a> But when he says that they, the Jews, are blinded, he seems to forget that it is only "in part.<a name=4:11></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And here it is that the system breaks down altogether, as I shall shew more clearly hereafter; for after all that is said about blinded Jews, and about the church only having the signs, if I am to receive the teaching of those most taught in the system, Christianity (the church) will have left Jerusalem, and indeed the whole Roman Empire, before the terrific signs appear; and there will be Jews in Jerusalem who will have received the testimony that Jesus was the Son of God, the promise of protection through the tribulation, of acceptance in Jesus after He shall have appeared, but who are not Christians at all.<a name=4:12></a><a href="#4:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a>

		has not at all considered the actual state of the disciples whom Jesus addressed.<a name=5:1></a> "Any," he says, "among that nation who received that one sign, and so came into the church, would indeed be thus introduced where these many signs were taught.<a name=5:2></a> But as Jews they rejected," etc.<a name=5:3></a> Now the disciples, when Jesus addressed them, had not received that one sign.<a name=5:4></a> They did not believe yet in the resurrection, but when stated to them, and that after Jesus had said "I will build my church" (and in the same chapter on purpose to make the contrast clear), the one most specially taught said, when this sign was proposed, "that be far from thee, Lord.<a name=5:5></a>" And afterwards it is said, "they saw and believed, for as yet they knew not the Scriptures, that Christ must rise from the dead.<a name=5:6></a>" Others said, "we thought that it was he that should have delivered Israel"; "and certain women also of our company made us astonished, saying, that they had seen a vision of angels which said that he was alive.<a name=5:7></a>" The disciples therefore were not yet of the "any among that nation who received that one sign," and consequently were not so come into the church.<a name=5:8></a> They reasoned among themselves sometimes, wondering what the rising from among the dead should mean; but, as far as they expressed any thought, they "rejected" it as involving His death -- whether as Jews I leave you to determine.<a name=5:9></a> The effect then of the writer's reasoning upon my mind is to shew me that (theorising upon our faith who are in the church of God and God's judgment on the blinded nation) he has entirely left out what the scripture actually states of the condition of the disciples; and that he has never taken into consideration, nor seen perhaps, the transitional state in which they were -- believing in Christ, and not believing in His resurrection at all.<a name=5:10></a> They were in this state when they were addressed, and therefore according to his own statements were not "come into the church.<a name=5:11></a>" Nothing of all this (that is, of the actual state of things spoken of in Scripture) comes into his calculation at all.<a name=5:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All his reasoning on Psalm 74 is nothing to the purpose, as there is no question in Matthew 24 of "our signs.<a name=5:13></a>" As in the mouth of a Jew, the words have evidently a totally different sense.<a name=5:14></a> The truth is, he has not understood the question.<a name=5:15></a> It is not whether the blinded generation sees the signs or has them -- though they will have all of them, but not receive the instruction of the Lord about them (as they had the sign of Jonas just as much as the disciples; and as they will have all that God is

	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the second letter, and expecting the return of Christ, it seems to me that the coming of Christ, also, is spoken of to the disciples in a way which he has not considered.<a name=6:6></a> It is written, "Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel till the Son of man be come.<a name=6:7></a>" He was there for the secret faith of His disciples; but He does not treat that as the coming of the Son of man; and He speaks to them as exclusively occupied with the cities of Israel, which they could not have time to go over before the Son of man should be come.<a name=6:8></a><a href="#6:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a> And now I beg attention to the chapter in which the passage I have alluded to above is found, as it contains one of those statements of which the use in Mark 13 and Luke 21 is particularly referred to in the tract to prove that the apostles must always be, and actually were, addressed as the church, or representing the church.<a name=6:9></a> The idea that they could be addressed in a peculiar character as connected with Israel (while many general principles are admitted to be applicable to the church, at least to those labouring in the work of the ministry during the time of the church, as well as any other) -- such an idea, I say, is treated as subversive of the first elements of Christianity.<a name=6:10></a> The passage quoted (page 7) from Mark 13 and Luke 21 to prove that Matthew 24 is absolutely addressed to the church as such is, "it is not ye that speak but the Holy Ghost.<a name=6:11></a>" In page 4 Will be found a summary of Matthew, with the particularities of this chapter 10 among others, produced (page 6), as clear and conclusive evidence of the gospel by Matthew to the character the twelve sustain therein; that is, that the Lord addresses them as the church.<a name=6:12></a>

		Now this is the commission in chapter 10: "Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not, but go ye to the lost sheep of the house of Israel," etc.<a name=7:1></a> They were to provide nothing for their journey; and to shake off the dust of their feet against the city that did not receive them; enquiring who was worthy where they went.<a name=7:2></a> They are then cautioned to beware of men: that they should be brought before governors and kings for His sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles: but, when delivered up, the Spirit of their Father would speak in them.<a name=7:3></a> The members of the same family would betray one another.<a name=7:4></a> They should be hated of all men for His name's sake; but he that endured to the end the same should be saved When persecuted in one city, they were to flee to another, for they would not have gone over the cities of Israel till the Son of man were come.<a name=7:5></a> Now, will any one say that this was addressed to the church, as the church?<a name=7:6></a> or to the apostles as representatives of it; when they are forbidden to go into the way of the Gentiles, but to go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel?<a name=7:7></a> And while undergoing persecutions, such as did eventually happen to them in the land of Israel when the church was formed, they are told, when persecuted in one city, to go to another, for that they would not have got over the cities of Israel till the Son of man should be come.<a name=7:8></a> Has this to do with Jews as Jews?<a name=7:9></a> Yet they suffer for His name's sake.<a name=7:10></a> Nor can it be doubted, on the other hand, that their bringing before kings and rulers was accomplished after Christ's ascension.<a name=7:11></a> Yet it is certain they are not here addressed as the church.<a name=7:12></a>

		Again, we are told, in a note, that, in a New Testament sense, only true believers are Jews.<a name=7:13></a> This is certainly new.<a name=7:14></a> The discussion, be it remembered, turns on the application of passages in Matthew.<a name=7:15></a> Does the writer adopt the idea that Matthew is Old Testament scripture?<a name=7:16></a> or is he in the system he states to be subversive of Christianity, that in Matthew the addresses are not to the church in the New Testament sense of things?<a name=7:17></a> For I suppose Jews are sometimes mentioned in this gospel, and in the three others, and even in the Acts.<a name=7:18></a> Yet I do not remember where this word is used in the sense of true believers.<a name=7:19></a> So that clearly, according to his statement, in these books the word has not a New Testament sense.<a name=7:20></a> But we have here a palpable proof of the absurdity of the system which assumes that everything that is said in the New Testament
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
		must have reference to the church viewed in its proper and highest privileges.<a name=8:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I understand what the writer means -- that, viewed in the light of New Testament privileges, carnal Jews are not recognised as the people of God.<a name=8:2></a> And who questions this?<a name=8:3></a> But to say that in a New Testament sense only true believers are Jews, is merely to say that we have closed our eyes to its use in a great part of the New Testament, because occupied with a theory of our own minds.<a name=8:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nor can the writer escape by saying he means new covenant, because the use of the word in the gospels remains there as a fact, so that it would be merely asserting that Matthew does not write in a new covenant sense.<a name=8:5></a> And, further, new covenant thus becomes worse than ambiguous: for, in Jeremiah, Israel and Judah are spoken of in their usual sense in connection with the new covenant.<a name=8:6></a> And, further, it is a confusion between the church's blessings and Israel's under the new covenant under the millennium: for all Israel will be saved, and saved as Israel, under the new covenant.<a name=8:7></a> Moreover, as to the Jews being cast off, page 12, Tract 3, the apostle uses the salvation of the believing remnant as a proof that this people, gainsaying and rebellious as they were, were not "cast off" -- concluding, that blindness in part was happened to them, but, that in result all Israel should be saved.<a name=8:8></a> And moreover, those of whom the writer thus speaks as cast off are not mixed up with the evil and adulterous generation, as Daniel 11, 12 and Isaiah 66 plainly prove.<a name=8:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The writer states they will have "refused all other testimony till the glory bursts on them like the glory on Saul.<a name=8:10></a> Most will perish, though a remnant shall be spared; but those who have believed in Jesus crucified and risen, and who have waited and watched for His appearing, etc.<a name=8:11></a>, will find the consummation of their redemption.<a name=8:12></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Yet I find in "Thoughts on the Apocalypse," page 125, that, after Christianity is withdrawn from Jerusalem, God raises up a new testimony -- a testimony of judgment, and not of salvation, but which will be received by a spared remnant, so that it is clear that there are those who will not have refused all testimony, and yet at a time that Christianity is withdrawn.<a name=8:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		Nor can this be contested.<a name=8:14></a> For the Lord Himself says, speaking to the nation as such, whose house was left desolate, "Ye shall not see me henceforth till ye say <a name=9>[Page 9]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord.<a name=9:1></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So that they certainly will have received some testimony before He comes.<a name=9:2></a> I confess it seems to me very clear indeed, that if the writer says that the coming of the Son of man will burst on that rebellious generation which has refused all other testimony, when the Lord says that they will not see Him till they have received other testimony, "this is to derange and confuse all the order and truth of God concerning these things.<a name=9:3></a>" I prefer believing in Scripture, that they will not see Christ till they say "Blessed be he that cometh.<a name=9:4></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The writer of the tract has clearly lost sight of a body of people, a remnant of whom the Scriptures distinctly speak, and whom God owns -- certain wise ones who do understand.<a name=9:5></a> He says, I am simply speaking of the body of Christian people, as the only body amidst which this idea, or hope, of the second advent of Christ could exist, and to which alone therefore, etc.<a name=9:6></a>, "not entering into this distinction between the professing church and the true church.<a name=9:7></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, here again, the system, built up on one side to condemn all others, is knocked down on the other; because, after the withdrawal of Christianity from Jerusalem, there is a new testimony raised up, whose grand object will be the coming of Christ.<a name=9:8></a> We have therefore instructions<a href="#9:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> addressed to some one else than the church about Christ's return.<a name=9:9></a> But Christ does not, in the passage we are considering, speak of His coming as His return, no more than in chapter 10.<a name=9:10></a> On the contrary, it is spoken of there, and here, as if it were His only coming, though we know He has come.<a name=9:11></a> Nor is there a word about His resurrection or departure.<a name=9:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, it is stated that, of the threefold division of Jews, Gentiles, and church of God, the disciples were the church.<a name=9:13></a> But there was no such division made at that time.<a name=9:14></a> Nor could there be, because Christ was not crucified, nor the church established.<a name=9:15></a> Such classes did not exist, nor could they be addressed therefore as such.<a name=9:16></a> They were apostles, when ordained to be with Jesus and to go only to Jews, as truly, though in another order, as when set to commence the church.<a name=9:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is denied that they represented one set of people in Matthew and another in John.<a name=9:18></a> But John himself makes the same distinction as to the difference of the presence of the

		Comforter; nor does mere denial, nor believing to be very fanciful, prove much.<a name=10:1></a> I should think that a person who could not distinguish between the tone of spiritual teaching in the last chapters of John and Matthew 24 must be very incapable of explaining either.<a name=10:2></a> It seems to me that the difference between "In that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you": and, "but when ye see the abomination of desolation standing in the holy place, then let them which be in Judea flee to the mountains," is very great indeed; and that it is neither fanciful nor injurious to perceive that one relates to union with Christ in heaven, and the other to the circumstances of Jerusalem on earth, prophesied of by Daniel the prophet as that in which a Jewish remnant were interested as such.<a name=10:3></a> We may find the same difference in Matthew and John in the testimony of John the Baptist, in Matthew 3: 12, John 1: 29-34.<a name=10:4></a> Further, they were not addressed as the church in John, though many things might regard the church.<a name=10:5></a> So, in Matthew 23 they are told to be subject to the scribes and Pharisees as sitting in Moses’ seat.<a name=10:6></a> There, clearly, they are not addressed as the church.<a name=10:7></a> I admit there is a difference between this and Matthew 24.<a name=10:8></a> But this just proves that the same persons may be addressed almost exactly at the same time (the circumstances were much more different in John, for there it was after the Supper), and yet addressed in a different character.<a name=10:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is the writer's own theory as to Matthew 23 and 24; but it is fanciful and injurious when applied to John, where the whole tenor of the gospel is different, and the circumstances much more contrasted.<a name=10:10></a> For in one case we have disciples in the temple before it was pronounced desolate, and out of the temple asking about it, and looking at it, and enquiring of its desolation.<a name=10:11></a> This is said to be different, and what is Jewish and of the church contrasted.<a name=10:12></a> Whereas in the other case John speaks of heaven, and union with Christ there; and yet this must be identical with Matthew 24.<a name=10:13></a> Again, it is said, in explaining Matthew, "the rock on which the church is built.<a name=10:14></a>" But the Lord says, "I will build" -- clearly shewing He did not address them as if the church existed then.<a name=10:15></a> In chapter 23 we are told He directly addresses them "as the heavenly family" -- as ourselves, for that is the point; for the grand evil alleged is depriving the church of certain scriptures.<a name=10:16></a> Consequently, the heavenly family and ourselves ought to

		and the falseness of that account itself.<a name=20:1></a> But the fact is his division is wrong too; for I say so for this simple reason, that the disciples, the very persons in question now, and whom the Lord addressed, were in neither of the cases thus abstractedly stated in order to judge their condition: a judgment, therefore, completely false, as is proved by the facts themselves.<a name=20:2></a> The disciples did more than fear God, they believed in Jesus as Messiah -- nay, in Peter's case, as Son of God, with whatever clearness of light -- I think we might say all did.<a name=20:3></a> They are not known in the New Testament as amongst those who are cast off.<a name=20:4></a> They were not to fear: it was their Father's good pleasure to give them the kingdom.<a name=20:5></a> They were a remnant separated from the nation by faith in the Messiah, and yet they did not trust in the blood of Jesus.<a name=20:6></a> They were on the hither or dark side of the line of demarcation, the cross of Jesus.<a name=20:7></a> So that they were in neither one nor the other of the states supposed, but in another entirely left out of consideration by the writer, and on which the whole question depends: while all the writer's reasonings run on the supposition of two cases, neither of which states the facts which actually existed.<a name=20:8></a> And yet, unless a person can embrace this mass of contradiction and carelessness and substitution of personal views for the patient following of the word of God, he is to be treated as holding opinions which subvert Christianity!<a name=20:9></a> Next, we are told that the word "ye shall not see me till ye say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord," points prophetically to that day when the Lord will spare unto Jerusalem a "very small remnant" who shall see Jesus in His glory and be converted unto Him.<a name=20:10></a>

		May beloved brethren remember that the written word of God, and the grace and teaching of the Spirit of God', are the only security against error, and the devices of Satan -- that ascribing authority to teachers, to "universal consent," or anything else but to the written word of God, is departing from the only security of the saints in these dark and evil days; and yet, if dark and evil, blessed in the resources of grace to him that has faith.<a name=23:7></a> If the Spirit of God be looked at as residing in the teachers and not in the whole body, it is the full-blown principle of Romish clericalism.<a name=23:8></a> If saints do not prove for themselves all they hear, they cannot have faith now; but they cannot help being made answerable for it hereafter, because God has commanded them to do it, and given His Spirit to the whole body, and to each individually, to enable them to do it, and they will be held responsible for this whether they will or no.<a name=23:9></a>

		A FEW BRIEF REMARKS ON "A LETTER ON REVELATION 12"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My Dear Brother, <p>I have read the tract you gave me.<a name=24:1></a> I confess to you such reading is an unwelcome task.<a name=24:2></a> I do not speak of this tract in particular, but in general of those that are written to maintain particular views, and not to act on souls.<a name=24:3></a> I am not blaming -- I leave liberty to -- those who think it right; but it is a very ungracious task, that of examining a brother's views to see if they are right, instead of learning what one can, and leaving the rest aside.<a name=24:4></a> However, as various views are maintained, it may be well to examine them with all patience, that brethren may, on the one hand, judge quietly; and that, on the other, there may not be the uneasiness in the minds of those who think these views wrong, of supposing mistakes current unanswered -- a feeling which often produces restlessness of mind; and the fruits of righteousness are sown in peace.<a name=24:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Many points, which seem of importance when undiscussed, dwindle wonderfully when all that is to be said is brought out; for saints, as all men, are apt to be fonder of their own ideas than other reasonable people are of them, when they see the light.<a name=24:6></a> On the other hand, the most unfounded have weight with many when unexamined; and are supposed to be unanswerable because they are unanswered -- a supposition that it is natural enough their authors should be prone to encourage -- a sorrowful ground this for saints to be on, but this does not make what I say untrue.<a name=24:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But to proceed to the examination of the tract, the first paragraph struck me as shewing considerable inattention to the force of phrases in Scripture.<a name=24:8></a> The throne of Jesus promised to him that overcomes is spoken of as being to the same effect as the man-child being caught up to God and His throne.<a name=24:9></a> Surely there is little or nothing in common between these two passages.<a name=24:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Sitting on the throne of God is never promised to the saints overcoming; nor does catching up seem to me the same thing at all as being seated on Christ's throne as a reward.<a name=24:11></a> The man-child was saved from the mouth of the dragon ready to devour

	<div class="paragraph">
		it as soon as born; and was caught away, and the woman left to be persecuted.<a name=25:1></a> Yet if this interpretation be not right, the whole structure of this chapter, on which the entire argument of the tract is founded, falls with it.<a name=25:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I also have a word to say about hope.<a name=25:3></a> I am very happy to say that I do believe the hope of the saints is quite independent of the question, "How long will it be before what we are hoping for will be realised?<a name=25:4></a>" But, is it independent of it, if it is laboriously sought to be proved that I must not expect it before a certain course of events is accomplished?<a name=25:5></a> This seems to make my hope dependent on these events.<a name=25:6></a> I do seriously believe our hope to be the bride's hope of the Bridegroom in virtue of the Holy Ghost dwelling in her, and not to be founded on mere prophetic testimony as to events.<a name=25:7></a> She is waiting for God's Son from heaven, independent of all events, and ignorant of how long it will be ere He returns.<a name=25:8></a> But, if it be a delusion -- hoping to see Him before certain events occur -- my hope is hardly independent of these events.<a name=25:9></a> And, if there seem delay, God is careful to assure us that He is not slack concerning His promise; and this reason and no other is assigned for the seeming long procrastination, that God is not willing that any should perish.<a name=25:10></a> This is God's way of treating this subject.<a name=25:11></a> It never occurred to the Holy Ghost to say it was all imagination to expect the Lord from heaven until certain earthly events should occur.<a name=25:12></a><a href="#25:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> If the accomplishment of the hope be dependent on certain events, its effect in the soul cannot be entirely independent of them.<a name=25:13></a> Nor do I see, if its moral power be really entirely independent of them, why so much pains is taken to press them as necessarily happening before it arrives.<a name=25:14></a> If it be not important to think it near, it seems at any rate to be so to prove that it is not.<a name=25:15></a> I do not call this its being "quite independent of the question, How long will it be before it is realised?<a name=25:16></a>" I believe it is so.<a name=25:17></a> But, if so, why so anxious to prove it cannot yet take place?<a name=25:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is another point which is important, and that is not merely that the thing promised is sure.<a name=25:19></a> The Lord considers it important that the saints should be always expecting

		it as a present thing, and wishing for it as a present thing -- I say expecting it as a present thing, uncertain when it will come.<a name=26:1></a> Thus He speaks in Luke 12: 35-40: "Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning; and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately .<a name=26:2></a>.<a name=26:3></a>.<a name=26:4></a> .<a name=26:5></a> And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants .<a name=26:6></a>.<a name=26:7></a>.<a name=26:8></a> .<a name=26:9></a> Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not.<a name=26:10></a>" And again, verses 43, 44: "Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.<a name=26:11></a> Of a truth I say unto you, that he will make him ruler over all that he hath.<a name=26:12></a>" Here surely they are told to be expecting always.<a name=26:13></a> Now, would the certainty that it must be two or three thousand years off not affect this state of mind?<a name=26:14></a><a href="#26:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> I say also, wishing for it as a present thing, as it is written, "The Spirit and the bride say, Come.<a name=26:15></a> And .<a name=26:16></a>.<a name=26:17></a>.<a name=26:18></a> He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly.<a name=26:19></a> Amen.<a name=26:20></a> Even so, come, Lord Jesus," Revelation 22: 17, 20.<a name=26:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The certainty, glory, and heavenly character of the hope, most important as it is, is not all.<a name=26:22></a> The Lord insists a great deal on a constant expectation of it, uncertain when it will be; a great deal on the tone and character of mind connected with this state of expectation of the Lord, coming and finding us so in our service.<a name=26:23></a> Now I do not deny that particular revelations may have been made to individuals, which shewed them that they should depart first, and so far modified their individual apprehensions.<a name=26:24></a> And I do not doubt that a saint may have a just and true conviction that his service is not yet finished, and yet be always waiting because he knows not when the Lord may come.<a name=26:25></a> But this does not the least affect the general state and expectation of the church.<a name=26:26></a> And is there the least analogy between such a particular revelation, and putting a whole train of events on earth as necessarily to happen before the church can expect the Lord?<a name=26:27></a>

		day, for I cannot expect His coming until the abomination of desolation is set up at Jerusalem, and then I can say, Now in twelve hundred and sixty days the Lord will be here.<a name=27:1></a> And this fixing by signs and dates, I am told, is the sober way of waiting.<a name=27:2></a> But it is quite clear that it is contrary to the way the Lord Himself has taught me to expect Him.<a name=27:3></a> It is clear that if these signs are to be expected for the church, I have nothing to expect till they are fulfilled.<a name=27:4></a> I may expect them, and have my mind fixed on them, but not on Christ's coming.<a name=27:5></a> And, when one particular one happens, I can name to a day His coming.<a name=27:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is not what Christ has taught me, and therefore I do not receive it.<a name=27:7></a> And remark how, in predicting to Peter that he would be cut off -- not telling it to the church, but to him -- the Lord, by His reply to his enquiry as to John, leaves the church again in this vague expectation.<a name=27:8></a> "If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?<a name=27:9></a>" This was soon disseminated; and the rumour spread that he would not die.<a name=27:10></a> But the conclusion, like most drawn from Scripture, was very wide in fact, though plausible in reasoning, from what the Lord meant, or had said.<a name=27:11></a> There is not, nor can be, faith in a conclusion, because a conclusion is not a revelation.<a name=27:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Note, moreover, that a particular revelation to an individual about his death is the strongest possible proof that the ordinary doctrine of the Lord to the church as to His coming was such, that it could not be expected that such persons should so die before it, and that this ought not to be expected, since it required a special revelation to make them think they would.<a name=27:13></a> "I must shortly put off this tabernacle as the Lord hath shewed me.<a name=27:14></a>" Was it not curious that there should be such a revelation of an individual's death, if the sanctioned [?<a name=27:15></a>constant] expectation was, not that they were not to expect it [death], but the Lord's coming in their life-time?<a name=27:16></a> Though it was never said positively when.<a name=27:17></a> Hence the apostle says: "We which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord.<a name=27:18></a>" And this expectation was so vivid that, while he sanctions it by saying "we which are alive," etc.<a name=27:19></a>, he has to reassure them by explaining that those deceased would be raised first, and enjoy the same coming and glory.<a name=27:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I find then the positive teaching of Scripture quite contrary to the reasoning that it makes no difference.<a name=27:21></a> Scripture teaches me otherwise, and I reject the reasoning.<a name=27:22></a> I pass over the

		triumphant argument which was used by the millenarians against the opposers of the personal reign, that if there were certainly a thousand years to come first, we could not be expecting the Lord from heaven.<a name=28:1></a><a href="#28:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> It appears that this was all a delusion.<a name=28:2></a> It served its turn.<a name=28:3></a> But, as any rate, it would be more honest now to tell them it was all a mistake.<a name=28:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And now, before I examine the critical explanation of the chapter, let me advert to some other important statements -- admissions of truth I would say, though the grounds on which others have affirmed these truths are disputed, as (for so we shall see by and by) those of the champions of this system are contradicted also.<a name=28:5></a> And I notice this, because I am sincerely glad, while noticing freely that with which I do not agree, to bring forward that with which I do.<a name=28:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The whole body of the saints treated of in the Revelation are recognised as being quite distinct from what is commonly spoken of as the church.<a name=28:7></a> I do not mean that it is stated that they do not form part of the church; but that both classes of sufferers noticed in this book are treated as quite distinct from us -- considered perhaps superior; but quite distinct.<a name=28:8></a> The book of Revelation does not apply to the church in its present state save in principle.<a name=28:9></a> The saints spoken of in it are not the primitive church, nor the church in its fallen state since (save in chapters 2 and 3), but an entirely new class of persons, and a different state of things.<a name=28:10></a> It is not stated whether there will be saints of the old or actual class of believers at the same time; but if so, they are not mentioned.<a name=28:11></a> Nothing can be more positive or decided than the writer's statement on the subject.<a name=28:12></a>

		Again, "Thus it would appear that the latter part of the Revelation, that is, from chapter 4 to the end is, as far as the history of the saints in the earth is concerned, a history of a certain company of saints, born in the latter end of this dispensation, that is, a short time before Christ comes with His saints to execute judgment," etc.<a name=28:15></a>, "that this part refers to the closing period of our dispensation -- the last few years of it, and that it is all unfulfilled.<a name=28:16></a>" I do not dwell on its being our dispensation or not now -- it is quite a new company which

		Further: "The martyrs seen in chapter 20: 4, etc.<a name=29:7></a>, are two parties of martyrs belonging to the company represented by the man-child," etc.<a name=29:8></a> We are going to discuss the man-child in a moment; but here we have the two parties of martyrs, besides the church in general and previous martyrs who are clearly to sit on the thrones that were placed, but who are not, as regards the saints in the earth, the immediate object of the Revelation.<a name=29:9></a> So that we have the church in general, and two distinct parties of martyrs, to whom, as regards the saints on earth, the Revelation specially belongs in its statements.<a name=29:10></a> Having then the distinct common ground, that there are these three classes (namely, the church in general, primitive and fallen; those beheaded for the witness of Jesus, etc.<a name=29:11></a>; and those who had not worshipped the beast), let us now enquire as to the detail of these last two classes, as there is no difficulty as to the primitive and fallen church: and indeed these two parties form the subject of the tract.<a name=29:12></a>

		The writer then takes the man-child as identified with "her seed," and so as a company, but considers "the remnant of her seed" not to be those besides the man-child (which would seem the natural use of the words: inasmuch as this child having been mentioned, the rest of her seed would seem to mean others besides the one who had been spoken of), but the man-child to be a whole company, and those that remain to be part of that company, left after another part have been martyred: to wit, those of verse 11.<a name=30:11></a> But first, these are never said to be her seed at all.<a name=30:12></a> Nor are they in any way whatever connected with the woman.<a name=30:13></a> There is a manifest break between verses 6 and 7, as is clear from this consideration, that the woman flies into the wilderness in verse 6 (up to which, I believe, the account is characteristic more than historical), and she does not flee into the wilderness (verse 14) till after the consequence of what happened in verse 7.<a name=30:14></a> Hence it is clear that verse 7 precedes verse 6 in historic time.<a name=30:15></a> Now, when it is said the dragon persecuted the woman, it is repeated (verse 13), "which brought forth the man-child"; and, after having again brought her on the scene (only on earth), as mother of this particular child, it is said, when she fled, that the dragon went to make

The only symptom of proof alleged is, that then the remnant of her seed would be also symbolic children representing companies. But it is the author's assumption that the man-child is a symbolic child representing a company. He recognises that some consider it to mean Christ: and, as the apostle reasons in Galatians, therefore them that are His; but merely by a subsequent process of reasoning. I have already said it is characteristic in my judgment. Besides the remnant of her seed is to me a general idea of relationship with the woman. Nor are they necessarily used as a symbol because the other is -- no more than the very same word in chapter 19: 21, "the remnant were slain," proves that they were all symbols like the beast. There is no force whatever in running one symbol or figure into another where they are not used together. But this is the only argument attempted. Christ as the seed of Abraham, in a certain sense, represents a company. We are Abraham's seed by faith in Him. Do each of us represent a company of Abraham's seed?

		I have already said I believe the term more general, and to bring the woman more forward than the previous seed; but, so far as it refers to it, it is to me characteristically, not as a company.<a name=32:2></a> At all events the only seed mentioned, and that repeated immediately before, is the man-child.<a name=32:3></a> But if this fall, as the proof does to me, entirely, then all the system of the writer as to these two remnants goes with it -- as he says "adopting this .<a name=32:4></a>.<a name=32:5></a>.<a name=32:6></a> we come at once to those conclusions.<a name=32:7></a>" But then, not adopting it (and I think it entirely false, of which every one will judge for himself), all the conclusions fall with it.<a name=32:8></a> For all the peculiar views as to these remnants are founded on this -- a slender base it seems to me for such important conclusions.<a name=32:9></a> But this is not all: I admit the two parties, or remnants, besides the body of the church in general.<a name=32:10></a> It is only their character which is in question.<a name=32:11></a>

		Next, "The brethren mentioned in verses 10 and 11 are those represented by the man-child; a part of whom having been slain," etc.<a name=32:16></a> Now the brethren, verses 10 and 11, are spoken of as a distinct and complete class, who had been in a given position previous to the casting down of the accuser, and had overcome therein: not of a whole company, part slain, part left.<a name=32:17></a> Nor, indeed, is there anything said of the slaying of the remnant of her seed in the chapter.<a name=32:18></a> At any rate the brethren are not a company, partly slain, partly left, but a distinct class definitely described whose case is ended.<a name=32:19></a>

		This third allegation is sustained by a reason (assumed, as we have seen, without proof) that the remnant of the seed are a part of those represented by the man-child; and that, as we shall see, contrary to the word itself: thus confirming the incorrectness of the whole supposition.<a name=32:20></a> Because, if the man-child be caught up before this war against the remnant of the seed, it is clear that this remnant cannot be a part of the man-child, so previously caught up as its final reward.<a name=32:21></a> Now what does the word say?<a name=32:22></a> The child was caught up to God and His

	<div class="paragraph">
		But, further, deliverance from the devouring mouth of the dragon is not surely our ultimate destiny, nor catching up to God's throne either.<a name=33:8></a> It may be a general idea of glorious security and honour, but it is not what is anywhere presented as our ultimate destiny.<a name=33:9></a> As to our sitting on a throne (that is, on Christ's throne as a Son of man), this is an important point, because if so (and I have no doubt of the justness of the objection), the whole system of the writer entirely falls with it.<a name=33:10></a> For my own part, I am satisfied that the catching up of the man-child has no kind of reference to any final state at all: whereas it is assumed as the basis of the argument, and then the brethren and the remnant made the different parts which compose it in their previous condition.<a name=33:11></a> It seems to me that reading the chapter attentively would refute this.<a name=33:12></a> At least the basis of it ought not to be assumed, to wit, that the catching up is the final glory.<a name=33:13></a>

		The fourth conclusion is a like argument.<a name=33:14></a> The remnant are assumed to be a part of the man-child, and therefore he cannot be caught up.<a name=33:15></a> The answer is, The scripture says he is.<a name=33:16></a> Moreover, the war of the dragon and the persecutions of the beast are assumed to be the same: or at least that the saints of God and the remnant of the woman's seed are the same, and the time spoken of the same.<a name=33:17></a> This may be, but it is a great deal to assume without any proof The fifth merely assumes what we have been discussing, and therefore I pass it over.<a name=33:18></a>

		I feel the spirit and tone of this tract to be incomparably superior to the others that I have read in support of the same system, but I find the same essential fault: a principle, deduced itself from a train of reasoning that has the support of the system in view, is laid down; and then, assuming this as a basis "we come at once" to a whole train of conclusions, instead of learning from the direct text of the word.<a name=38:7></a> And then something is urged that suits the natural and so popular feeling, such as here the noblest ambition of the saints, which I find contradicted in every way the moment I turn to the word.<a name=38:8></a> This carries away many.<a name=38:9></a> But where?<a name=38:10></a> A system takes the place of godly subjection to the word.<a name=38:11></a> And alas!<a name=38:12></a> this is suited to a decline of spirituality.<a name=38:13></a> As this becomes feeble, the exercise of mind, and the play of the mere natural feelings, become a necessary ailment.<a name=38:14></a> But to the soul, fresh in its spirituality, the word of God (and oh!<a name=38:15></a> how can it be otherwise?<a name=38:16></a>) has more sweetness in its least statements (for they come from God) than any indulgence whatever of the mental powers.<a name=38:17></a>

		ELEMENTS OF PROPHECY, IN CONNECTION WITH THE CHURCH, THE JEWS, AND THE GENTILES
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first grand and capital point is to have the end and design of God clearly and settledly in mind, so that it should be constantly before us as the key and test of all.<a name=41:1></a> For "no prophecy of scripture is of any private interpretation .<a name=41:2></a>.<a name=41:3></a>.<a name=41:4></a> but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.<a name=41:5></a>" The divine glory is ever the end of all things; but I speak now of the effect of divine counsels in which God glorifies Himself.<a name=41:6></a> Now this is altogether in Christ, known in the various glories in which He is revealed.<a name=41:7></a> In the church the office of the Holy Ghost, who moved the holy men of old, is to take the things of Christ and shew them to us.<a name=41:8></a> Hence, though Jerusalem, or Israel, or even the church, may be that in connection with which Christ may be glorified, it is only as connected with Him that they acquire this importance.<a name=41:9></a> So of the word even of the Old Testament scriptures: they are all to make us wise unto salvation, through faith which is in Christ Jesus.<a name=41:10></a> On the other hand, as it is evident that this alone gives, to whatever subject may be mentioned, its true and just importance, so, if Jerusalem is connected with Christ, with His affections and glory, Jerusalem becomes important; and I get in its connection with Christ, so far as I understand His glory, the key to interpret all that is said of it.<a name=41:11></a> It has, in the mind of God, its development in connection with the manifestation of His glory.<a name=41:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There may have been in the times of Israel certain manifestations of the governmental dealings of God, important for their faith and subjection to God by the way, which were partial accomplishments of such or such a prophecy.<a name=41:13></a> But these, though true, and though research may discover them, are, in a certain sense, comparatively lost now in the sum of the whole scheme of all which closes in Christ.<a name=41:14></a> It may be interesting and instructive historically, as regards God's dealings, to observe them in their place, but they become history -- important, interesting history -- not prophecy, for us.<a name=41:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first point, then, important to understand is, that neither the church, nor Jerusalem, nor the Gentiles, are in
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=42>[Page 42]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		themselves the objects of prophecy, still less Nineveh, or Babylon, or the like, but Christ.<a name=42:1></a> But this is what gives us the true scope and intelligence of the real importance and place of each subject; namely, as Christ is to be the centre in which all things in heaven and earth are to be united, various subjects become the sphere of His glory, as connected with Him, and each subject is set in its place in its connection with Him, and by this connection I get the means of understanding what is said about it.<a name=42:2></a> Thus, if the church is the Lamb's wife, it is in this character and in this relationship I must apprehend what regards it.<a name=42:3></a> If Jerusalem is the city of the great King, it is in this that I shall get the key to the dealings of God with it.<a name=42:4></a> If the saints are to live and reign with Christ, and to be kings and priests unto God and His Father, here I shall find the intelligence of what concerns them in this character: not united with the Bridegroom, but associated with the King and Priest.<a name=42:5></a> And so of the rest.<a name=42:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Not only is this the only way of understanding prophecy as to the objects of it, but, the affections being right, the understanding is clear -- the eye is simple and the body full of light.<a name=42:7></a> I see with God in the matter, for He regards Christ; and thus prophecy becomes sanctifying, not speculative, because what it teaches becomes a part of Christ's glory for the soul.<a name=42:8></a> The importance of this cannot be well overrated.<a name=42:9></a> I ought not to have to persuade Christians of the truth of this; I gladly would of its importance.<a name=42:10></a> This, however, is the work of God.<a name=42:11></a> Objectively, I may cite Ephesians 1: 9-11 as stating this great truth according to the purpose of God.<a name=42:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I may now endeavour to present some of the main subjects or landmarks for the study of prophecy; that is, of the revelation of God's ways for accomplishing His glory in Christ.<a name=42:13></a> No present circumstances, note, though they may be historically instructive and also confirmatory of faith, can be the proper accomplishment of prophetic truth; because, though they may be conducive to it, under God's superintending government, and a lesson at the time and afterwards, they are not identified with the manifestation of God's glory in Christ, nor the immediate objects in which that manifestation takes place (for we are supposing things precedently accomplished).<a name=42:14></a> This shews that, in accomplishment, all necessarily is found in the actors of the scene at the close, when judgment will fully manifest, not in measure to intelligent faith, but by the public
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		acts of God, what His judgment is; and as this judgment is on ripened evil, the full character of this (whose principles have from the beginning been working, been discerned spiritually, judged partially so as to stay their power for the accomplishment of God's gracious designs) -- the full character, I say, of their fruit will then be shewn, and God publicly justified in His judgment before all, as well as bringing in blessing, by setting aside in power the evil, and replacing it by His own reign in good.<a name=43:1></a> And this is the vast moral difference of our present state, as well as of true saints in all times, from the world to come.<a name=43:2></a> We have the power of God internally, through grace and by the Spirit, to make good the will and glory of God in the midst of evil while subsisting; whereas then, i.<a name=43:3></a>e.<a name=43:4></a>, by the presence of Christ, the evil will be put away by power, and good be at ease.<a name=43:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next simple remark that I have to make is that, though the relationship of heaven with earth may be discovered to us, in so far as heaven and those there are revealed as the established governing power (that is, that there are, in the seat of government placed above, objects of special revelation), yet the proper subject of prophecy is the earth, and God's government of it.<a name=43:6></a> Ant it is only so far as the heavenly company are connected with the government of the earth that they become a collateral subject of prophetic revelation.<a name=43:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Further, providence is not the subject of prophecy.<a name=43:8></a> By providence I mean the ordering of the course of all things by divine power, in such sort that all results which happen in the world are according to the divine purpose and will.<a name=43:9></a> Often inscrutable to us in its reasons and even the means it employs, and leaving the government of God obscure, still it is certain to faith, and that by which it remains true that God is not mocked -- what a man sows this will he reap.<a name=43:10></a> Faith will recognise the hand of God in many things, and believes it in everything; but to the world all of it is hidden.<a name=43:11></a> Certain principles, universal with God in their application, by this means are verified, as "righteousness exalteth a nation.<a name=43:12></a>" The men of this world see nothing of the bearing of the moral causes on the effect, or, if they do see the causes, the result issuing thence is that they ascribe the effect to them, and God is shut out.<a name=43:13></a> His immediate action and government is excluded.<a name=43:14></a> Now the subjects of prophecy are the contrary of this.<a name=43:15></a> The public products of God, coming in in power, are revealed.<a name=43:16></a> They are

		either the day of the Lord, or the characteristic results which bring it about -- a judgment which man has to acknowledge as of God.<a name=44:1></a> Now it is evident that the day of the Lord, properly speaking, closes the history of this world; it is the opposite of that secret course of government which is carried on, and from the checks of which the pride of man rises again to pursue his course of evil.<a name=44:2></a> When God sets to His hand, the proud helpers do stoop under Him.<a name=44:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not deny that certain grand and remarkable judicial interventions of God are called, in a subordinate sense, the day of the Lord, in virtue of their practical analogy with that time of which it shall be said "the Lord alone is exalted in that day.<a name=44:4></a>" But even these are in contrast with the course of providential government, which, in its very idea, does not interrupt but regulate the ordinary course of events.<a name=44:5></a> There are prophecies which may, to some, seem to refer to the course of providence, but these confirm, in a remarkable way, the distinction.<a name=44:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Take the ten horns.<a name=44:7></a> What is the providential history of these horns, taken as usually applied by commentators?<a name=44:8></a> Scourges, which continued some one hundred and fifty years, from first to last, working the overthrow of the Roman Empire, as previously settled, and establishing themselves as conquerors in all its Western territory.<a name=44:9></a> We may enquire, if done humbly, with profit, why this scourge was permitted.<a name=44:10></a> Whether it was the public civil evil, or the corruption of the church.<a name=44:11></a> What moral causes led to it.<a name=44:12></a> How it executed the moral judgment of God on the evil.<a name=44:13></a> Why the East was spared.<a name=44:14></a> How it led the way to a more terrible spiritual tyranny than had yet been seen in the world.<a name=44:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Take the prophetic account.<a name=44:16></a> A beast rises out of the sea with ten horns all full grown, after which a little horn comes up, and the beast, horns and all, are the subject of God's judgment, not the executors of it.<a name=44:17></a> This is prophecy; that was providence.<a name=44:18></a> We have what characterises the object of prophecy and its judgment, and the reason of it.<a name=44:19></a> All the providential part, out of which commentators have woven an immense system, is left out -- so of the statue.<a name=44:20></a> It is all there at once, the application of it to the empires given, the character of four, the closing object of judgment in the feet and toes, and the execution.<a name=44:21></a> Of the providential course of events, by which one takes the place of the other, we find nothing.<a name=44:22></a>

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=45>[Page 45]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have taken the cases which would seem to give the greatest room for it, and of which in this respect men have said the most.<a name=45:1></a> And with what result?<a name=45:2></a> Such that, if taken as a literal accomplishment, a child can see the discrepancy.<a name=45:3></a> What analogy between one hundred and fifty years’ war to destroy an empire, and ten kingdoms, all in full energy and growth, arising out of it and forming part of it as the symbol of its force?<a name=45:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the Apocalypse, before the end, we find summary judgments executed with progressive severity in the seals, trumpets, and vials, before the King comes forth to destroy the beast: judgments inflicted of God; but not, in Scripture, providential history.<a name=45:5></a> They are all proper immediate judgments, though they be but preparatory, and introductory, inflicted on either the circumstances or the persons of the men of this world -- on the wicked.<a name=45:6></a> The hand of God is seen.<a name=45:7></a> But there is no explanation of causes or providential course.<a name=45:8></a> We find their moral state, exceptionally, in that which they refuse to repent of in one case; but, in general, it is not the course of events guided by providence to order all things well, but the earth subject to the judicial vengeance of God.<a name=45:9></a> No careful reader can question this.<a name=45:10></a> The end of providence is the present ordering of God's government to bring about His designs.<a name=45:11></a> The Apocalyptic history consists of judgments inflicted.<a name=45:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Further, we may add, that providence is occupied in the daily discipline of the children of God.<a name=45:13></a> Prophecy treats of the judgments of God (removing out of His sight those whom He judges), and of the full blessing of His people.<a name=45:14></a> I do not think any prophecy can be alleged speaking of a course of events applied to His people while they are owned.<a name=45:15></a> The nearest approach to it is Isaiah 9:7 to 10:25; but these are inflicted judgments, and no course of providence.<a name=45:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having thus spoken of the subjects of prophecy morally, I may turn to the positive subjects it embraces.<a name=45:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		Besides the creation, of which He is the Head, in which we may comprise angels, there are three great spheres in which Christ's glory is displayed -- the church, the Jews, and the Gentiles.<a name=45:18></a> The church, properly speaking, is not the subject of prophecy.<a name=45:19></a> As to Old Testament prophecy, the New declares in the most absolute and positive manner that it was a mystery hidden in all ages, and now revealed to the apostles and prophets by the Spirit.<a name=45:20></a> The church belongs to heaven, is the body of Christ seated there, and while He is so seated.<a name=45:21></a> Prophecy <a name=46>[Page 46]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		relates to earth.<a name=46:1></a> The church is viewed, it is true, when it takes part in the government of the earth for that reason; and the marriage of the Lamb and the description of the heavenly Jerusalem give the epoch from which dates the character of this relationship with earth.<a name=46:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the New, the relationship of the church with Christ caused the Holy Ghost to remain in it, and communicate the needed light on its position while waiting for the Lord.<a name=46:3></a> There was no presence of God attached to formal institutions subsisting, to consistency with which a series of prophets was to recall a people (necessarily, while they subsisted, the people of God).<a name=46:4></a> In one respect, however, though the church was not the proper subject of prophecy, while it subsisted as owned of God, certain things connected with it are predicted; that is, its decay and corruption, as a present moral warring; but this passes into mere apostate wickedness, as a distinct object of judgment.<a name=46:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence when, as I doubt not, and as a vast number of Christians believe, the Lord would give a picture of the church's history as an external body in the world, in a state for the most part in which He could not at all own it as His heavenly body, He selects, with divine wisdom, seven churches which afforded the moral character of the states into which it would successively fall, and presses His judgments morally on them.<a name=46:6></a> But it is not made a positive subject of prophecy.<a name=46:7></a> Whatever may be our judgment of the subsequent part of the Apocalypse, which treats of events subsequent to the period of the seven churches, it certainly consists of judgments on the world, not of any prophecy of the church, save as stated at the close.<a name=46:8></a> There is the simple fact, that the beast overcomes certain saints, and that he puts to death two witnesses.<a name=46:9></a> No general prophecy of the church itself is found in the course of the Apocalypse.<a name=46:10></a> It was right to give these facts.<a name=46:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The reason is evident to one who knows what the church is.<a name=46:12></a> It is not of the world.<a name=46:13></a> It, as such, sits in heavenly places in Christ, where prophecy reaches not.<a name=46:14></a> It never will be established on earth, as the Jews.<a name=46:15></a> It is not its calling.<a name=46:16></a> The government of God will never settle it there in peace.<a name=46:17></a> His blessing for it will be to take it away from earth, to be with the Lord in the air.<a name=46:18></a> A partial application of the Apocalypse to what has the name of the church, but is the power of evil in the world, I do not deny; but this does not make the church a subject of
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=47>[Page 47]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		prophecy.<a name=47:1></a> Accordingly, we find, as we have said, the church in heaven at the end in connection with the earth, when all is united in Christ; but no account of any dealings of God to establish it, or a progress towards a result of any kind.<a name=47:2></a> She is to reign with Christ, and suffer with Him.<a name=47:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The remaining spheres of the display of the glory of the blessed Lord are the Jews and Gentiles, subjects in different degrees of His earthly government, as the church was the full exhibition of His sovereign grace in redemption, which places her in heavenly places in Christ, that in the ages to come God might shew the exceeding riches of His grace in His kindness to us in Christ Jesus.<a name=47:4></a> This distinction is full of interest.<a name=47:5></a> Man is not governed in introducing him into the church.<a name=47:6></a> He is taken as a rebellious lost sinner, a hater of God, a child of wrath, be he Jew or Gentile, and set in the same place as Christ.<a name=47:7></a> This is not government, it is grace.<a name=47:8></a> The Jews are the centre of God's immediate government, morally displayed according to His revealed will.<a name=47:9></a> The Gentiles are brought to recognise His power and sovereignty displayed in His dealings with them.<a name=47:10></a> I speak of the thing, properly speaking, in its revealed character; for every sinner in all ages, is saved as such, individually, by grace, and every Christian is under the immediate government of the Father as of the heavenly family; but even so the object of government is different.<a name=47:11></a> With the Christian, it is to prepare him for heaven; with the Jews, on the contrary, it is to display God's righteousness on the earth: I speak of them as a body or people.<a name=47:12></a> Christ and the church suffer for righteousness, and reign.<a name=47:13></a> The Jews, as a people, suffer for sin, and the result of their history will be, "Verily, there is a reward for the righteous; verily, there is a God that judgeth the earth.<a name=47:14></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Further, prophecy does not apply to a state where God's people, responsible under the government of God, walk well, so that He can bless them as walking under His own eye in testimony of His favour.<a name=47:15></a> This special intervention, for such prophecy is, applied to the case of their failure.<a name=47:16></a> Hence, when Shiloh was overthrown and the ark taken, Samuel was raised up, of whom the Lord therefore says, "Beginning at Samuel and all the prophets.<a name=47:17></a>" This character of prophecy is completely .<a name=47:18></a> evident in reading the prophets, who addressed their prophecies to the people in general.<a name=47:19></a> Indeed, its principle is evident.<a name=47:20></a> But, if they shewed the people their transgressions, they pointed

		out constantly the Messiah, the great Deliverer.<a name=48:1></a> Thus it is in Hannah's song (1 Samuel 2:9,10), where the government of the world by Jehovah in sovereignty<a href="#48:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> and the exaltation of Messiah are fully brought out.<a name=48:2></a> So, historically, Samuel was raised up on the failure and ruin of Israel, and introduced David Prophecy judges the people in their responsibility, and announces the sovereign purpose of God.<a name=48:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But this leads me to note two characters of prophecy, arising, as regards the Jews, from two different positions in which we find them in Scripture: first, a people more or less fully owned of God (God acting amongst them on known principles of government); secondly, rejected for a time (the sovereign power in the earth being confided to Gentiles).<a name=48:4></a> This last period forms the times of the Gentiles.<a name=48:5></a>

		Having brought out this second ground of judgment, I leave it for the moment, in order to consider the former ground, rebellion against Jehovah.<a name=49:3></a> Israel ought to have been the witness of the blessedness of being in such a relationship with the Lord.<a name=49:4></a> "Happy are the people who are in such a case; yea, blessed are the people who have the Lord for their God.<a name=49:5></a>" Israel, on the contrary, learnt the ways of the heathen; yea, became more corrupt than they, and the Lord allowed the surrounding nations to attack and distress them.<a name=49:6></a> This had its full development in the ten tribes; the house of David, raised up in grace, being for a time a stay to Judah.<a name=49:7></a> Though all the surrounding nations had their share in these attacks, the principal in result was Asshur.<a name=49:8></a> Accordingly, in the end, this power prevails entirely against Israel and overruns Judah, the Lord only at the close defending Jerusalem, where the son of David was a stay in righteousness.<a name=49:9></a> Still, if Israel had deserved all this chastisement, these rods of chastening had in their animosity despised the Lord, His people, and His throne.<a name=49:10></a> Asshur especially had exalted himself against Him that hewed therewith.<a name=49:11></a> Hence they become the objects of destroying judgment themselves.<a name=49:12></a>

In order to save themselves from the overflowing scourge, Judah, who had rejected Christ, will associate themselves with Antichrist and the apostate Gentiles, and even join in idolatry; but the scourge will for all that pass through.

When all hope is shut out and the enemy is coming up again in pride, the Lord will appear and save them, and take them up against all their enemies.<p>As regards the ten tribes, at least the great body of them, this will not be their history. Having determined to be like the Gentiles, God has not suffered it; they are not under Antichrist and not cut off in the land, but brought, like Israel coming out of Egypt, under God s rod, and the rebels cut off, so as not to enter.

		BRIEF ANALYSIS OF THE BOOK OF DANIEL

		"Christian Witness," Volume 2, Plymouth, 1835.<a name=55:1></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I send you some analyses of books of prophecy, which I may be enabled at some future period, with the divine permission and blessing, to fill up with some further details.<a name=55:2></a> I feel this to be a more satisfactory method than framing any system which the study of Scripture makes me feel I possess.<a name=55:3></a> What does appear plain and distinct to me, I trust may be occasion of study and of information to other minds.<a name=55:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would begin with Daniel.<a name=55:5></a> The book is clearly divided into two distinct parts.<a name=55:6></a> The former comprises visions and dreams of unrenewed heathens, or circumstances connected with their conduct.<a name=55:7></a> This ends at chapter 6.<a name=55:8></a> The latter consists of communications to the faithful prophet of the events in their moral character connected with the people of God; many of them in point of time, antecedent to what is related in the former part, but separated into a distinct portion or book of themselves, as having a specific character.<a name=55:9></a> Thus the visions of chapter 7 and 8 clearly precede in point of time the circumstances in chapter 6, or we might, I think, add even chapter 5.<a name=55:10></a> But they are revelations to Daniel instructing him in the bearing of the subjects of previous visions on the state of the saints.<a name=55:11></a> The former portion shews the history of the world in its outward character, its manifested forms, and the question thereon raised between their powers and God.<a name=55:12></a> The latter (as might naturally be expected in revelations to a prophet standing as the representative of the people of God) reveals the position and character of the agents in relation to the saints, their full moral character, and all that internal history in which those saints were most especially concerned.<a name=55:13></a> The latter part is from chapter 7 to the end.<a name=55:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I shall give the briefest outline of this structure now.<a name=55:15></a> We have then Daniel's visions only from chapter 7 inclusive; the former are facts, or the king's visions.<a name=55:16></a> But in the former we shall find distinct portions.<a name=55:17></a> Chapter 1 merely gives us the character of Daniel as separated from the pollution in which he was mixed up by the judgment of God on the nation; and the privileges of him and the three other children; and Daniel's

		continuance to the year of deliverance to his people.<a name=56:1></a> We have then, in chapters 2, 3 and 4, Nebuchadnezzar's history.<a name=56:2></a> In chapter 5, the destruction of the remainder of his empire, for the profane usage of what belonged to God.<a name=56:3></a> And then, in chapter 6 another scene -- the kingdom of Darius.<a name=56:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 2, the first prophetic one, properly speaking, we have the divine wisdom setting forth distinctly the man of the earth, in all his varied characters; beginning with, and represented by, the head of gold -- Nebuchadnezzar; that which attracted the attention and comprised the power of the visible world beneath.<a name=56:5></a> The destruction of this by the agency of power in its last form; and the substitution of that power which filled, not merely awed and overlooked as it were, the whole earth.<a name=56:6></a> Daniel's God owned therein in the acknowledgment of Him; as it is written, "that seek thy face, O Jacob": and Daniel's exaltation over the known world -- he stood there as the Jew.<a name=56:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have in chapter 3 the general character attached to this period in the person of the golden head of the whole.<a name=56:8></a> It was connected with religion -- that was not left out.<a name=56:9></a> It was not merely secular power: and while the man was the power in the world in the previous dream, here is that which it did openly: the exercise of its power, or Satan's power by it would not be complete.<a name=56:10></a> It was not infidelity, in the common sense of the word, or atheism, but a compulsory religion; in which the power and will of this man of the earth was shewn, to which the honours of the state were compelled to bow; an image all of gold set up -- a most beautiful and gorgeous display, and calculated to attract by its own excellency, and illustrate the honour of him who had set it up.<a name=56:11></a> It was, however, an image in the province of Babel -- a furnace to the faithful: not however, I remark, to Daniel, who I believe to have represented the Jew distinctively, but those whose help was found in one like to the Son of God being with them in the furnace, while they were thus in it, making them free.<a name=56:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 4 states the external glory of a tree, the symbol of exaltation in the earth, which God had made to flourish; and this change takes place.<a name=56:13></a> Instead of subduedness and intelligence (to, wit, of God), there is given to this exalted representation of power a beast's heart -- ravening and ignorance of God, till they should learn that the Most High ruleth.<a name=56:14></a> That a man's heart signifies this quietness and subjection, is shewn

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 5 it seems to me (sorrow is it to think) that profaneness against God in a degraded state, will be the mark of final judgment on this apostate state of things.<a name=57:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have then in chapter 6 another state of things entirely -- an utter open casting off of God; bringing Daniel, the prophetic representative of the Jew, into the den of lions.<a name=57:5></a> That which had taken the place of the previous state of things, seized on Babylon, but was not it, in its power or its source; openly throwing off God in folly, and thereupon the Jew made a prey, but delivered, and the everlasting kingdom acknowledged, and the princes taken in the net which themselves had laid.<a name=57:6></a> I do not excuse the Jews from the former similar case; but this seems exclusively and definitely to belong to them.<a name=57:7></a> The character of the apostasy is different.<a name=57:8></a> Darius sets up himself as God, or at least as alone to be prayed to, not setting up in his glory an image to be worshipped.<a name=57:9></a> Both perhaps may characterise, in some form, the apostasy of the latter day.<a name=57:10></a> This seems in all its character confined to it, and to make way for the everlasting kingdom.<a name=57:11></a> The King of heaven, the Most High, is the acknowledgment of the former; the everlasting kingdom of the living God, of the latter.<a name=57:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All these things are consequent upon "Lo-ammi" being written upon the Jews, and the manifest throne of God amongst the Jews, having ceased and been cast down.<a name=57:13></a> Then, I take it, the beast's heart properly had its rise.<a name=57:14></a> Man could be given up to folly, and Babylon become the seat of exalted madness and folly of heart: he might exercise it uncontrolled, save by the watchful eye of God ruling from the heavens; for Jerusalem was cast down -- the throne of God had departed from the earth -- His earthly care was now hopeless.<a name=57:15></a> (See Ezekiel 10: 19, and the reasons in the previous chapters; chapter 11 and the statements following to the end of chapter 12) Daniel 4: 30 shews what took its place; and then properly came in the beast's heart for the seven times.<a name=57:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have now arrived at the second portion of the book, wherein their general characters and characteristics of apostasy are brought into far greater detail in connection with the saints; and the book assumes the form of regular though symbolical prophecy, being direct communications to the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in this portion also there are distinct and definite parts: chapters 7, 8, 9 and 10 to the end, are all distinct visions -- four distinct visions, as may be seen by their dates.<a name=58:3></a> However, we shall see there is further order amongst them.<a name=58:4></a> Chapters 7 and 8 describe the conduct and circumstances of the four beasts, with interpretation and prophecy added.<a name=58:5></a> Chapter 9 is the specific consideration of the desolation of Jerusalem, with its appointed time.<a name=58:6></a>

		Chapter 10 to the end, what shall befall Daniel's people in the latter days, preparatory to this; as God had not taken His eye off them, and yet they were "Lo-ammi.<a name=58:7></a>" The circumstances through which they should be passed until connected with the prince that should come, as given in chapter 9 at the close, are detailed most accurately and minutely in the former part of chapter 11 -- the real history, God's history, of what is given apocryphally in the uncertain books of the Maccabees.<a name=58:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus chapter 9 also, it appears to me, more particularly connects itself with chapter 7; and chapter 11 with chapter 8 -- the close of it, however, connecting both in "the king," and the king of the north, and the king of the south (the last being the conclusion of the whole matter).<a name=58:9></a> Thus chapter 9, like the judgment on Belshazzar, comes in, dividing the general history of the beasts, and the specific detail of the last climax of deliberate open apostasy.<a name=58:10></a> The king shall do according to his will, not regarding any god.<a name=58:11></a>

		Let us turn back to chapters 7 and 8; and here I must remark as to what is called interpretation in the prophecy, that it is by no means merely explanation, but a use and application of some previously declared general symbol to specific results; often involving therefore material additional revelations, or omission of circumstances, not affecting those particular results.<a name=58:12></a> This we shall see plainly in those two chapters.<a name=58:13></a> I turn to their analysis.<a name=58:14></a> Chapter 7 contains three distinct visions, and then interpretations.<a name=58:15></a> The first vision is from verse 2 to verse 6 -- four beasts, but the description only of three (the last being reserved for a distinct vision).<a name=58:16></a> The second vision is from verse 7 to the end of verse 12.<a name=58:17></a> The third is contained in verses 13, 14.<a name=58:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The <i>first vision</i> sees the first beast reduced from violence to subserviency, and is so disposed of -- it ceased to be a beast.<a name=58:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The other two are merely described.<a name=59:1></a> The <i>second</i> describes the fourth beast, its little horn, and the judgment of the Ancient of days upon the life and body of the beasts because of it; but only considered as between it and the judgment.<a name=59:2></a> The <i>third</i> is the subsequent and consequent giving of the kingdom to the Son of man brought before Him, with its character and extent.<a name=59:3></a> Verses 15, 16 contain the request for interpretation.<a name=59:4></a> Verse 17 is the interpretation of the first vision -- kings arising out of the earth, with (verse 18) an additional revelation, that the saints of high places take the kingdom.<a name=59:5></a> Verse 19 is the request of the truth about the second vision, with some additional character in verse 20 of the little horn; and an additional vision in verses 21 and 22; for it is to be remarked that, in the visions, the outward position of the beasts in the world with the saints, or their internal history, is not at all introduced.<a name=59:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		From verse 23 to the end of verse 26 is the interpretation, with many additional particulars.<a name=59:7></a> Verse 27 gives the result of the third vision on the earth; but, being identified and involved in its causes with what precedes, it is given continuously.<a name=59:8></a> The interpretation, in a word, is the bringing in of the heavenlies into the subject, though only as known in effect upon earth; but attaching that name which implied the possession of heaven and earth -- the Most High.<a name=59:9></a> It has been already observed, I believe, in some previous paper, that this word, when connected with "saints," is, as in margin, "high places," or "things"; the same, I doubt not, with the heavenly places of Paul.<a name=59:10></a> I would also refer the Christian reader to Psalm 2: 4: to me it opens a distinct field in Revelation 13: 6.<a name=59:11></a> This is all connected with the fourth beast, which, as well as the first, was thus far previously passed over.<a name=59:12></a>

		On chapter 9 I have little to add, as a continuous prophecy, including petition and answer.<a name=60:10></a> Only I would refer to verse 7, that it involves all Israel as well as Judah and Jerusalem; so in verse 11, "Thy city and thy people," and the matter of supplication.<a name=60:11></a> I would only remark, how intercession in the time of intercession holds the expression, "Thy people" (as with Moses in the mount), in spite of Lo-ammi written upon them, or a broken covenant; but the reference is at once in Moses to God's covenant, not the people's: so here the confession is complete.<a name=60:12></a>

		SHORT BUT SERIOUS EXAMINATION OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES ISSUED BY MR. GAUSSEN IN HIS BOOK ENTITLED "DANIEL THE PROPHET"¦
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The form of this pamphlet sufficiently indicates that I have no intention of replying in a detailed manner to Mr.<a name=63:1></a> Gaussen's book, nor of discussing the points on which there are differences with him.<a name=63:2></a> I do intend to shew that the bases of his system have no solidity, no foundation whatever.<a name=63:3></a> I believe there has been up to a certain point an accomplishment of the prophecies in question in the ages which have just expired.<a name=63:4></a> Circumstances morally analogous may be found in them, or at least systems and an activity animated by the principle which will have its entire development only in the last days.<a name=63:5></a> The word authorises me to judge thus when it says that there were already many Antichrist in the time of John.<a name=63:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe also that the irruption of the barbarians furnished the elements of that which by and by is to be the accomplishment of certain prophecies as to the Roman Empire; so that I have no desire to combat ideas a long time since spread abroad, and now reproduced, discussed, and embellished by Mr.<a name=63:7></a> Gaussen.<a name=63:8></a> But since the system of [Bp.<a name=63:9></a>] Newton and his successors, there have been different views published on several important points.<a name=63:10></a> If these views are not false, the reproduction by Mr.<a name=63:11></a> Gaussen of the old doctrine of Newton and others is but a step backward, a retrograde course calculated to turn aside souls from light that God has given.<a name=63:12></a>
	</div>

		However, though I do not accept the old system, I should not have been drawn in to contest its solidity by the mere fact that people have sought to support it with new arguments; I should have preferred to unfold the truth directly.<a name=63:13></a> Here are the passages which induced me to shew in few words the nullity of the reasonings which Mr.<a name=63:14></a> Gaussen has laid down as the foundation of the capital points of his system.<a name=63:15></a>

		With respect to this expression the most complete confusion is found in the ideas of Mr.<a name=64:3></a> Gaussen between the presenting of the Son of man to the Ancient of days, and the coming of Jesus from heaven to earth.<a name=64:4></a> The passage of Daniel 7 is applied by Mr.<a name=64:5></a> Gaussen, sometimes to the one, sometimes to the other, of these two things.<a name=64:6></a> (See vol.<a name=64:7></a> 3, pages 24, 26, 29-31, 157, 162, 165.<a name=64:8></a>) The confusion of the coming of Jesus in the clouds with the rapture of the church is also found in the book; so that these three things, the presenting of the Son of man to the Ancient of days, the rapture of the church to meet Jesus in the air, and the appearing of Jesus with all the saints to judge the world, are confounded together by Mr.<a name=64:9></a> Gaussen The practical effect of the confusion of these last two events is shewn in page 86, and also in 172 and 173.<a name=64:10></a> Here is a part of this last passage.<a name=64:11></a> "Yes, if the coming of Jesus filled with so much emotion a soul so pure, a man of so many prayers, a prophet so holy, to whom the angel said, 'O Daniel, a man greatly beloved' -- if the great Daniel saw this day with so much concern, twenty centuries before the event, what must it be for those who shall be there personally, who shall hear the trumpet, and see its brightness?<a name=64:12></a>"

		'Hence it is that the apostle, learning that in fact such was their mistake, hastens to write a second epistle to them, in which he tells us the first words this dear child has just read to us': "Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him, that ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.<a name=65:2></a>" 'Here again, dear children, a word of explanation.<a name=65:3></a> The day of Christ is always very near for each believer, since we are all at once transported thither at the hour of our death, time thenceforth being nothing for us, and a thousand years less than a day.<a name=65:4></a> But for the church it is not so.<a name=65:5></a> For the church this day of Christ is at a distance; and even in this sense the day was certainly many ages off from Paul and his contemporaries.<a name=65:6></a> You will understand then that this false notion of the Thessalonian Christians (who believed the church to be only a few days from the return of their Master) could easily, as St.<a name=65:7></a> Paul told them, shake their minds and sadly trouble their faith.<a name=65:8></a>'
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Pay attention to this expression ["transported thither at the hour of death"], which neutralises wholly the force of the phrase, "The day of Christ.<a name=65:9></a>" It is also found again in page 173.<a name=65:10></a> Assuredly, at the hour of death, the soul is not transported to the judgment of the habitable world, which is the scriptural sense of the words "day of Christ" (or "of the Lord").<a name=65:11></a> I know not whether this goes along with the sad opinion of some Christians that the soul sleeps at death.<a name=65:12></a> Because it is said in speaking of the death of a man living in this world that he fell sleep, they have concluded that the soul sleeps in the other world.<a name=65:13></a> But these two things have no connection whatever.<a name=65:14></a> The language of the Lord as to Lazarus, "Our friend Lazarus sleepeth," proves that it is only a question of his bodily death -- an expression of which He made use to explain it to His disciples.<a name=65:15></a> Were this idea true, the Christian would not be transported to the day of Christ.<a name=65:16></a> You have only to take a concordance and search the phrase, "day of the Lord," and you will soon see that it is God's judgment on the inhabitants of the earth, whether partial or find.<a name=65:17></a> Now for the execution of this judgment Christ must appear.<a name=65:18></a> But, when He "shall appear, we also shall appear with him in glory.<a name=65:19></a>" "Those who are with him are called, chosen, and faithful.<a name=65:20></a>"

		Besides, Mr.<a name=66:4></a> Gaussen tells us that the reading of the first inspired letter of the apostle made the Thessalonians fall into an error.<a name=66:5></a> I will not characterise this reasoning: but there is no room at all for such a supposition.<a name=66:6></a> The apostle attributes this error (which besides was quite another thing from what Mr.<a name=66:7></a> Gaussen says) to deceivers and to a pretended letter.<a name=66:8></a> Mr.<a name=66:9></a> Gaussen has here abandoned the version of Lausanne, which renders the sense correctly ("the day of Christ was there"), to adopt the word "at hand.<a name=66:10></a>" Now the Greek word (<i>enestecke</i>) is always, <i>without exception</i>, employed in the New Testament for a thing present, and even in contrast with things to come.<a name=66:11></a> The translation which says "is there" (present) is good; that which says "is at hand" is false.<a name=66:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The deceivers troubled the Thessalonians by affirming that the day of the Lord was come -- probably (see 2 Thessalonians 1) taking advantage of the violent persecutions which had fallen on the church in Thessalonica, and certainly pretending that they had inspiration, the word, and even a letter of the apostle's to confirm what they alleged.<a name=66:13></a> The apostle gives two reasons wherefore that terrible day could not be there.<a name=66:14></a> The first is our gathering together to Christ.<a name=66:15></a> The rapture of the church had not yet taken place.<a name=66:16></a> We shall be in heaven before that day arrives -- a truth taught in the clearest way in the word to which we shall recur.<a name=66:17></a> The second is, that the object of the judgment was not yet there, and consequently the judgment could not possibly take place.<a name=66:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here are proofs in support of what I have said.<a name=66:19></a> First, it is certain that the sense is not that the day is <i>at hand</i>, but that it is <i>arrived</i>.<a name=66:20></a> Here are all the passages of the New Testament where the word in question is employed: Romans 8: 39, where it is translated "things <i>present</i>"; 1 Corinthians 3: 22, "things <i>present</i>"; 1 Corinthians 7: 26, "<i>present</i> necessity"; Galatians 1: 4, "this <i>present</i> evil age"; Hebrews 9: 9, "time then <i>present</i>"; and 2 Timothy 3: 1, "<i>shall come</i>" (i.<a name=66:21></a>e.<a name=66:22></a>, shall be <i>present</i> or <i>there</i>).<a name=66:23></a> These passages prove, so as to leave no doubt whatever, that the sense of the word is "present" in contrast with "things to come.<a name=66:24></a>" Besides, the Greek for "at hand" is another word.<a name=66:25></a> Mr.<a name=66:26></a> Gaussen in

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Moreover, in 2 Thessalonians 2: 1 the true force of the word is certainly "we beseech you <i>by</i>" and not "as concerning.<a name=67:2></a>" The English version, that of Luther, that of Geneva in 1605, Desmaret's Bible, and the Vulgate, have rendered it thus.<a name=67:3></a> It is true that <i>huper</i> in certain cases signifies "as concerning"; that is, it has almost the sense of <i>peri</i>.<a name=67:4></a> But it is unquestionable that, when it is employed with words of prayer and request, its regular meaning in Greek is "by," "for the sake of.<a name=67:5></a>" No person who is at all familiar with the Greek tongue, or who is willing to take the trouble of using a good dictionary, would deny it.<a name=67:6></a> Here then is the passage in its true force: "Now we beg you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to him, that ye be not soon shaken in mind, nor be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as [if it were] by us, as that the day of the Lord is present.<a name=67:7></a> Let not any one deceive you in any manner, because [it will not be] unless the apostasy have first come and the man of sin have been revealed," etc.<a name=67:8></a> That is, the apostle gives two reasons why they should not believe that the day of the Lord was come: first, the rapture of the saints is not yet; and secondly, the object of the judgment is not revealed.<a name=67:9></a> It is this passage which, twenty years ago, made me understand the rapture of the saints before -- perhaps a considerable time before -- the day of the Lord (that is, before the judgment of the living.<a name=67:10></a>)

	<div class="paragraph">
		I add what is found at bottom of the last column of the Pentables.<a name=67:11></a> "After Babylon has been burnt by the ten kings, and the ten kings themselves, the beast and the false prophet have been judged in their turn, then comes the first resurrection; the saints reign with Christ a thousand years.<a name=67:12></a>" Then again the third column, under the title of "Eternal Monarchy," says: "The stone, after smiting the image, becomes a great mountain, and fills the whole earth"; and on the mount in, in the engraving which accompanies this passage, we find inscribed -- "the church.<a name=67:13></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		Such are the passages which, with many other similar ones, have induced me to bring out the utter want of foundation which distinguishes Mr.<a name=67:14></a> Gaussen's book.<a name=67:15></a> I do not reason upon the passages themselves.<a name=67:16></a> It is evident that the object of the first is to hinder souls from waiting for the Lord, to

		<a class="footnote" name="#71:f2"><sup>++</sup></a>Here Mr. Gaussen places the words "the church of the elect" between inverted commas, as if they were a quotation from the word. I do not remember that there is such an expression in the word. Sometimes people add the word "church" to that of "elect." We find an instance in 1 Peter 5: 13: "The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you." But the word "church" does not exist in the original; and if that word were found there, it would hardly suit Mr. Gaussen, because it would then be a particular assembly which was elect. I must warn the reader to be carefully on his guard with respect to apparent quotations from the word, which are to be found in this book. Not that I have the least idea that there is any dishonesty on Mr. Gaussen's part; but having attributed his opinions to the word, he uses phrases, in the form of quotations, which do not exist in the word, as if the word said what he thinks. For instance, page 255 we read: "The mother of the one hundred and forty-four thousand, who keep the commandments of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ, and have made their robes white in the blood of the Lamb." There is no such passage to be found in Scripture. There are several passages tacked together (the words, "the mother," being added), which have no connection with each other, except in Mr. Gaussen's system. In the same page we find: "The apostle takes great care to tell us that the church has there a place prepared of God; that at a later time they should feed her there twelve hundred and sixty days." But the apostle did not say it was the church, neither did he say "at a later time -- two things without which the passage is of no value as a proof of the point for which Mr. Gaussen quotes it.

		The distinction made, page 62, between "the duration of the persecution," and "the end of the power of the beast," is worthless, since it is said (verse 21, 22) that the horn is to make war with the saints and prevail against them, until the Ancient of days come and judgment be given to the saints of the Most High.<a name=76:2></a> Now I do not think that Mr.<a name=76:3></a> Gaussen will pretend that the empire subsists after the coming of the Ancient of days, and after judgment is given to the saints of the Most High.<a name=76:4></a> Thus, a simple comparison with this passage is enough to destroy another important part of this system.<a name=76:5></a> The persecutions terminate by the coming of the Ancient of days and judgment given to the saints.<a name=76:6></a> Besides, Mr.<a name=76:7></a> Gaussen formally contradicts himself on this point.<a name=76:8></a> In pages 181, 182, he applies the verses we have just quoted in the same sense which our reasoning attributes to them; he makes out "that the church is oppressed, until at last the time arrives when the monarchy of Jesus Christ and His saints commences on earth.<a name=76:9></a>" In pages 181, 182, he says as much of the little horn, "that ungodly power which is to prevail against the church until the end of times.<a name=76:10></a>" See also vol.<a name=76:11></a> 2: 4, the same thing.<a name=76:12></a> In vol.<a name=76:13></a> 3, page 234, Mr.<a name=76:14></a> Gaussen tells us, "It now then remains for us to see it again in chapter 13, under the decem-regal form, and in chapter 17, under the democratic form.<a name=76:15></a> It will be the time of the little horn.<a name=76:16></a>" Now in chapter 13 the duration of the decem-regal beast is "to continue forty and two months.<a name=76:17></a>" The little horn makes war with the saints until the Ancient of days come and (Daniel 7: 25, if the words are applied to the saints) they are given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of times.<a name=76:18></a> Mr.<a name=76:19></a> Gaussen tries to make a distinction between "made war with the saints, and prevailed against them," and "shall be given into his hand" -- an unwarrantable distinction, as we shall see, but which, at all events, does not remove the contradiction which I point out here.<a name=76:20></a> One has only to compare pages 62, 181, and 182.<a name=76:21></a> The distinction was necessary for his democratic beast, but it is evident that the little horn and the ten-horned beast go together and perish together.<a name=76:22></a>

		It is well to pay attention to another thing; it is this, that the most important possible point is treated in the author's system as an admitted truth, as an uncontested principle, namely, that it is the church which is in question in these prophecies.<a name=77:1></a> Now many persons believe that it is a question of a Jewish remnant, and they quote the word to prove it.<a name=77:2></a> This is a main point.<a name=77:3></a> Mr.<a name=77:4></a> Gaussen does not take the trouble to discuss it.<a name=77:5></a> He keeps on this point an absolute silence.<a name=77:6></a> It is necessary to his system that it be the church; he cannot prove it, and he asserts it without any proof.<a name=77:7></a> On this subject Mr.<a name=77:8></a> Gaussen lays down a principle that is entirely false, namely, that God is leading the world with a view to the church.<a name=77:9></a> It is Christ and His glory which are the object of the counsels of God.<a name=77:10></a> The church will share that glory, and thus it is also included in the counsels of God.<a name=77:11></a>

		It will be understood that this changes everything in prophecy.<a name=77:17></a> For instance, the greater part of the prophecies apply to a time when Israel is more or less owned in their land.<a name=77:18></a> All this is left aside, and finds no place in Mr.<a name=77:19></a> Gaussen's system.<a name=77:20></a> Now, when Israel is owned, and when it is a question of that people, the church, where there is neither Jew nor Gentile, is necessarily out of the scene.<a name=77:21></a> It is no longer a question of length of years, but of "a short work" of God upon the earth, in days, of which it is said, "Except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved" -- a passage where the Saviour Himself <i>directs our attention to Daniel and to passages where it is a question of the twelve hundred and sixty days</i>.<a name=77:22></a> This therefore goes to the root of the question on the point which is disputed between the two great schools.<a name=77:23></a> Mr.<a name=77:24></a> Gaussen entirely avoids it; even in his preface he already speaks of the coming sufferings of the church as of an admitted truth.<a name=77:25></a>

Nothing more solemn than the manner in which Sardis is put on the *same footing as the world*. (Compare 1 Thessalonians 5.) I beg of the reader to pay attention to this; the contrast with Philadelphia renders the thing more striking. The energy which produced the blessed Reformation was a precious gift of God. But the seven churches depict to us, not energies which produce certain results, but the various states which followed the effect of those energies; for it is a question of the judgment of the Son of man. Now the power of the Spirit of God is not the object of the judgment of Christ; that which is its object is the state of man when he enjoyed that power. <p>It is never a question, in these churches, of grace communicated. There 'are threats and rewards -- in a word, motives and responsibility.

The little horn may make war with the saints and overcome them when they are not given into his hand, according to Mr. Gaussen. We shall deal with that distinction farther on; if the little horn and even the persecutions last after the twelve hundred and sixty days, the identity of the period with the authority of the beast has very little meaning. Moreover Mr. Gaussen deals with his own distinction in pages 72 and 73: "The war of the little horn with the saints makes in the style of prophecy a times, times, and half a time," that is, only lasts during the decem-regal period.

		I have already called attention to the manner in which Mr.<a name=108:8></a> Gaussen excludes Christ from the judgment of the beast, so that I do not return to it.<a name=108:9></a> There have been judgments executed on the beast, vials poured out, and that even upon its seat or throne; but here it is a question of a final judgment with respect to the image, with respect to the ten kingdoms -- a judgment which causes them to disappear from the face of the earth.<a name=108:10></a> To exclude Jesus from it, so as to make it a consequence of the persecution of some little portion of the church, is enough to shew that the whole system which hangs upon it is nothing but the sport of the imagination of man.<a name=108:11></a> I respect, I repeat, the piety of the writer; I honour him, as sincere; as a man, I respect him.<a name=108:12></a> But I frankly own that I feel no respect for such a use -- for such a perversion -- of the word.<a name=108:13></a> I make allowance for an ardent imagination; I acknowledge how easy it may be for one to make a mistake on such subjects, if one goes beyond the plain teaching we may have received from God, and of which every one who has studied prophecy with piety will bring his share, whatever be his system.<a name=108:14></a> But as to Mr.<a name=108:15></a> Gaussen's book, it is not only that it contains an erroneous system.<a name=108:16></a> The writer avows that it is good to consider the coming of the Saviour as being at a distance for the church.<a name=108:17></a> He destroys the great foundations of the word, not on prophecy, but with regard to the judgment executed by Jesus; and he gives as quotations that which is not found in the word, in a way that deserves the strongest reproof of every faithful soul.<a name=108:18></a>

		WHAT SAINTS WILL BE IN THE TRIBULATION?
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The question, Will the saints be in the tribulation?<a name=110:1></a> suggests itself to every one who is occupied with the hopes of the church of God and the prophetic declarations of Scripture as to the close of this earth's painful and laborious history.<a name=110:2></a> Personal anxiety suggests it on one hand, and on the other it connects intimately with the gravest and most vital points of prophetic enquiry; or rather of the true character of the church of God and its condition at the close.<a name=110:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I cannot, in the space allowed me here, enter at large into the declarations of the Old Testament as to a remnant, nor of the New as to the church.<a name=110:4></a> But a short answer to the question itself will help to throw light on the points I allude to and on the rapture of the saints.<a name=110:5></a> I purpose adding a development of the true force of 2 Thessalonians 1, 2, so often introduced in the discussions which have arisen on these subjects.<a name=110:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And first, as to our being in the tribulation: How do I know there will be a tribulation?<a name=110:7></a> I must get some revelation of it.<a name=110:8></a> He who would place the church in it will answer me, I am sure, that the Scriptures are clear on the point.<a name=110:9></a> There will be at the close a tribulation, a time such as there has never been, till the Lord's coming brings deliverance.<a name=110:10></a> What, then, are the Scriptures which tell us that there will be such tribulation?<a name=110:11></a> I am not aware of any other direct ones than these: Jeremiah 30: 7; Daniel 12: 1; Matthew 24: 21; Mark 13: 19 (Luke does not speak of it nor of the abomination of desolation); to which we may add the more general passages of Revelation 3: 10; chapter 7: 14.<a name=110:12></a> The first four passages do effectively prove that there will be a time of tribulation such as never was since there was a nation, or, as it is expressed in Mark, "such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created, neither shall be.<a name=110:13></a>" The passages from Revelation apply, we shall see, to a wider sphere than the preceding ones; but as they speak of a great tribulation, I have, of course, quoted them.<a name=110:14></a> There will be then a tribulation.<a name=110:15></a> The other part of the question still remains: Shall we, who compose the church, be in this tribulation?<a name=110:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The answer to this question must be sought in the passages which speak of the tribulation itself.<a name=110:17></a> The first of them, Jeremiah 30:7, is as clear as possible in announcing those to
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=111>[Page 111]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		whom it applies: "It is the time of Jacob's trouble, but he shall be delivered out of it.<a name=111:1></a>" This time, then, of trouble, such as never was nor will be (so that there cannot be two), is the time of Jacob's trouble.<a name=111:2></a> Nothing can be clearer or more distinct.<a name=111:3></a> The whole chapter may be read, which sets it in the clearest light.<a name=111:4></a> It is not merely that Jacob may be found there, but when it is said, "Alas!<a name=111:5></a> for that day is great, there is none like it," the trouble spoken of is Jacob's trouble.<a name=111:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next is Daniel 12: 1.<a name=111:7></a> This is also positively declared to be of Daniel's people.<a name=111:8></a> The whole prophecy is the description of what is to happen to Daniel's people in the last days.<a name=111:9></a> Daniel 10: 14.<a name=111:10></a> Michael, also (compare chapter 10: 21), Will then stand up for that people, and, as Jeremiah had said, they will be delivered (that is, the elect remnant -- those written in the book).<a name=111:11></a> Daniel's testimony then is also quite clear.<a name=111:12></a> The tribulation is the tribulation of Daniel's people.<a name=111:13></a> But this is the rather important because it carries us at once to Matthew, the Lord Himself declaring that He speaks of this same time and same event, using the terms of Daniel, and referring to him by name as well as to the statements of the passage.<a name=111:14></a> Compare Matthew 24: 15; Daniel 12: 11.<a name=111:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But all the language of the passage in <i>Matthew</i> confirms this.<a name=111:16></a> Those who are in Judea are to flee to the mountains.<a name=111:17></a> Those who are on the housetop are not to come down to seek anything.<a name=111:18></a> The abomination which causes desolation stands in the holy place.<a name=111:19></a> They are to pray that their flight may not be on the sabbath.<a name=111:20></a> False Christs and false prophets are to seduce with the hopes cherished by the Jewish people.<a name=111:21></a> All is local and Jewish -- has no application to hopes which rest on going to meet Christ in the air.<a name=111:22></a> What is in question is "flesh" being "saved" (i.<a name=111:23></a>e.<a name=111:24></a>, life spared on earth).<a name=111:25></a> <i>Mark</i> relates evidently to the same event and almost exactly in the same terms.<a name=111:26></a> Thus these four passages, which speak of the unequalled tribulation, apply it distinctly to Jacob, Jerusalem, and Judea, and the Jews, not to the church.<a name=111:27></a> It is entirely another order and sphere of things from the church, and professedly so.<a name=111:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two passages which, as I have said, are more general: Revelation 3: 10 and 7: 14.<a name=111:29></a> Do these, then, apply to the church?<a name=111:30></a> The language of Revelation 3: 10 is this, "Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world to try them which dwell on the earth.<a name=111:31></a>" That is,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=112>[Page 112]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		when the church is addressed, it is with a declaration that she will be kept from that hour which shall come to try others.<a name=112:1></a> So that thus far the testimonies of Scripture declare that the unequalled tribulation is for Jacob, and that, when the time of temptation is spoken of in addressing the church, it is to declare that the faithful shall be kept out of it.<a name=112:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Revelation 7: 14 may seem more difficult; still it bears witness to the same truth.<a name=112:3></a> For the heavenly kings and priests (that is, the elders who have represented them from the beginning of the second or strictly prophetic part of the book) are professedly another class of persons, who have not come out of the great tribulation.<a name=112:4></a> One of these elders explains to John who those who have come out of the great tribulation are, another class of persons from themselves.<a name=112:5></a> One of them asks John, Who are these who are arrayed in white robes?<a name=112:6></a> etc.<a name=112:7></a> John refers to him, and then he explains.<a name=112:8></a> That is, the crowned elders are quite a different class from them; so that, while admitting the passage to be obscure in certain points, it is clear in this -- in giving us the elders and those who came out of the tribulation as two distinct classes.<a name=112:9></a> The crowned elders are not at all represented as having been in it, but as pointing out others as those that come out of it.<a name=112:10></a> Every element of the description of these persons confirms this distinction.<a name=112:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another passage -- Revelation 12 -- while not using the term tribulation, yet speaking of the epoch at which it is to happen, strongly confirms this same truth.<a name=112:12></a> When Satan and his angels are defeated by Michael, he is cast out and come down to the earth, having great wrath, knowing he has but a short time, and persecutes the woman.<a name=112:13></a> Now what is the effect of this most important event on those who can celebrate its bearing?<a name=112:14></a> That the trial of the heavenly saints is ended, and that of the inhabiters of the earth and the sea just about to begin in its most formidable shape, because Satan is cast down there.<a name=112:15></a> The language is this: "Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ; for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night: and they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, and they loved not their lives unto the death.<a name=112:16></a> Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them.<a name=112:17></a> Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea," etc.<a name=112:18></a> Now I do not say that this is the moment of the rapture, for I think it is included in the

	<div class="paragraph">
		man-child's being caught up.<a name=113:1></a> But I say this that, at the moment of the commencement of the great rage of Satan for the three times and a half, the entire deliverance of the heavenly saints from his power, and their definite triumph is celebrated; that is, they are not exposed to that last time of Satan's rage.<a name=113:2></a> This chapter, then, confirms, in the fullest way, the exemption of the church from the last and dreadful time of trial.<a name=113:3></a> I am satisfied that the whole teaching and structure of the Revelation confirms the same truth; but this would evidently lead me into too large a sphere of enquiry.<a name=113:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have found that the passages which speak of the tribulation first apply it directly to the Jews on one side, and then exclude the church from it on the other.<a name=113:5></a> I do not see how such a point as this could be made clearer by scripture.<a name=113:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I now turn to the interpretation of 2 Thessalonians 1, 2.<a name=113:7></a> There is in the latter chapter and (I think I may say) acknowledged mistranslation, of which the true and undoubted sense gives the key to the whole passage.<a name=113:8></a> I refer to verse 2, "as that the day of Christ is at hand": it should be "is present.<a name=113:9></a>" The word is used for, and translated in two different places, "present," in contrast with things to come -- "things <i>present</i> and things to come.<a name=113:10></a>" This is always its sense in Scripture.<a name=113:11></a> What the Thessalonians were troubled and upset in their minds by, then, was that they had been led by false teachers (pretending to the Spirit, and even alleging a letter of Paul to this effect) to suppose that the day of Christ was actually come.<a name=113:12></a> The violence of persecution was very great; and as the day of the Lord is in effect spoken of as a day of terror and trial in the Old Testament, these false teachers had profited by this to persuade them it was there.<a name=113:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle with divine wisdom sets them morally right in chapter 1, as to their feelings and sentiments as to this, before entering in the second into positive instruction as to the fact of the Lord's coming.<a name=113:14></a> He shews them the folly (since Christ was to appear for that day, He Himself being present in it) of supposing that it was His own people and faithful ones He was going to make suffer and cast into distress and tribulation.<a name=113:15></a> No; it was His enemies and theirs who would be in affliction in that day, and they themselves in rest and peace.<a name=113:16></a> The very righteousness of God would assure this.<a name=113:17></a> It was a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble them, and to His troubled ones rest, when Christ shall be

		revealed, for this was what brought in the day.<a name=114:1></a> It was only shewn by their tribulations that He counted them worthy of His kingdom that was then to come.<a name=114:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In a word, as the day was Christ's and brought in by His personal presence, when it was there they would have rest and their persecutors trouble.<a name=114:3></a> It is the contrast of state when the day is there, not the epoch of its commencement, which is spoken of.<a name=114:4></a> Indeed, had it been so, it would have been a poor and uninspired comfort, for they would not have rest yet.<a name=114:5></a> On the other hand, the adversaries of the constant expectation of Christ would gain nothing; for the apostle's words so interpreted would have led the saints at Thessalonica to a constant expectation of His appearing, instead of their rapture, as the moment of getting rest.<a name=114:6></a> But the truth is, the using the Greek word <i>anesis</i> (rest) as significative of the moment of attaining the rest is a mistake.<a name=114:7></a> The word, though used for the time of obtaining relaxation, is equally used for a state of ease, or even pleasure.<a name=114:8></a> It is never used in Scripture for the moment of obtaining relaxation from trial, but always in the general sense of a state of ease, one contrasted with <i>theipsis</i> (distress).<a name=114:9></a> The whole and sole force of the apostle's reasoning is this, that as the Lord Himself was to bring in the day, it could not, when there, be a day of distress for His people, but evidently for His enemies and their persecutors.<a name=114:10></a> In chapter 2 he proceeds to unfold to them the real order of the events, and especially in connection with the place they had in them.<a name=114:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here, again, we meet a question of criticism, but it affects very little the reasoning of the apostle.<a name=114:12></a> Some would change here the authorised English version, and read, "But we beseech you, brethren, concerning the coming," etc.<a name=114:13></a>, instead of "by the coming.<a name=114:14></a>" The preposition itself is used in both ways; but its constant force with words of beseeching is 'by' (sometimes 'for,' which has no place here).<a name=114:15></a> The force of the apostle's reasoning is this, that as they were to be gathered together <i>to</i> Christ, they could not be in the day which was to come by His appearing; they were to go to meet Him in the air, and hence could not be in the judgments of that day, it trials or its terrors.<a name=114:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle had taught them in his first epistle that they were to be caught up to meet the Lord in the air.<a name=114:17></a> Hence he could refer to it as a known truth.<a name=114:18></a> The saints were not to await the coming of the day of the Lord on the earth, but to

		go up to meet Him in the air, and be for ever with Him.<a name=115:1></a> Did He appear, they, we know, would appear with Him.<a name=115:2></a> But here he speaks of what they ought to have remembered, that they would go up before the day, and hence they could not possibly be there in their actual state on earth, if the day was.<a name=115:3></a> The church's connection with the return of the Lord was, to go up to meet Him in the air, to be gathered unto Him.<a name=115:4></a> The day was entirely another thing; it was vengeance from His presence.<a name=115:5></a> Neither could the day therefore come before the objects of vengeance were there.<a name=115:6></a> An apostasy would come, and the man of sin would be revealed, whom the Lord would consume with the breath of His mouth, and destroy by the appearing of His presence.<a name=115:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is, we have two things (which from other scriptures also we know to be distinct, exactly in this way, Christ's coming, and the manifestation of it; for when He appears, we shall appear with Him -- hence we <i>must</i> be with Him before even He appears at all, yet at His coming), the coming of Christ and the public epiphany of His presence, with one of which the saints are directly connected, by being gathered together to Him; with the other, the day, because at His appearing He will execute judgment against the ungodly.<a name=115:8></a> They will be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of His power.<a name=115:9></a> But He will come to be glorified in His saints, and admired in all them that believe; that is, they will be in the display of this glory in that day.<a name=115:10></a> They will appear with Him in glory -- be like Him.<a name=115:11></a> Now it is quite certain they will not appear <i>with Him</i> when they are caught up to meet Him in the air.<a name=115:12></a> Thus it is not merely particular expressions, though these are clear and forcible, but the bearing, and object, and course of reasoning of the whole chapter, which shews the distinction of the rapture of the saints before Christ appears, and the coming of the day when He is admired in them.<a name=115:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What is important to remark is, the entire difference of relationship in which the saints are put with Christ: we belong to Him, go to meet Him, appear with Him, are glorified together.<a name=115:14></a> The practical result is, not merely to clear up a question of dates and of time, but to change the whole spirit and character of our waiting and Christ's coming.<a name=115:15></a> We wait for Him to come and take us to Himself, the full realisation of our heavenly calling.<a name=115:16></a> There are no events connected with

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I add a few words on another passage suggested to me as one by which difficulties have been created in some minds, really desirous of the truth.<a name=116:7></a> I mean the connection of chapters 4 and 5 of first Thessalonians.<a name=116:8></a> I confess it does not affect my own in any way; but as it does the minds of others, it is well to notice it.<a name=116:9></a> The difficulty, if there be any, arises from a serious confusion in the minds of those who make it -- the very confusion into which the Thessalonians were led, namely, taking tribulation for the day of Christ.<a name=116:10></a> For the day of Christ, Christ must appear.<a name=116:11></a> Let us only keep this clear in our minds, and all these difficulties vanish.<a name=116:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Thessalonians looked so earnestly for Christ's coming, with no further knowledge of the manner or order of it, that they thought believers who had died, and perhaps died even for Christ, would not be there to meet Him.<a name=116:13></a> This mistake the apostle corrects.<a name=116:14></a> He tells them that they must not grieve as those without hope; that they would not be left out of the <i>cortege</i> of glory; that Christ would bring them with Him.<a name=116:15></a> He then explains to them the manner, and shews that it is by their resurrection, which would take place before even the then living ones are changed; and when this is also wrought by divine power, all would go up to meet Him in the air, and so they would be for ever with the Lord.<a name=116:16></a> This parenthetically explains the manner by express revelation.<a name=116:17></a> They will go up to meet Him -- subsequently, as we have seen from Colossians, appear with Him when He appears.<a name=116:18></a> The parenthetical part merely gives the association of the saints with Christ Himself, which is our proper portion.<a name=116:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But he had said, as a general truth, in answer to their fears, that God would bring them with Christ.<a name=116:20></a> This leads him naturally to the general subject.<a name=116:21></a> He had no need to speak of

	<div class="paragraph">
		times and seasons.<a name=117:1></a> The Thessalonians knew perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night, and when they (the world) say Peace and safety, sudden destruction would come upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; he adds, "But ye, brethren, are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief: ye are all children of the day.<a name=117:2></a>" It is alleged that the apostle could not have said that the day would not overtake them as a thief, if they were not to feel liable to be in some sort overtaken by it.<a name=117:3></a> Now, if the teaching of the apostle be examined, even in the place, there is no possible ground for this: for the day of the Lord Christ must appear.<a name=117:4></a> But he had just taught them that they were to be caught up to meet Him in the air and be brought with Him.<a name=117:5></a> That is, he had taught them what made it impossible to suggest that the day could overtake them in any way or manner whatever.<a name=117:6></a> They were of the day, so to speak, as he indeed says, "ye are children of the day," "let us who are of the day.<a name=117:7></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This passage says nothing of not being in the tribulation -- we have treated that point already; but the objection confounds the tribulation and the day which really closes it.<a name=117:8></a> The tribulation is Satan's power (though God's judgment in woe); the day is Christ's, who makes it and binds him.<a name=117:9></a> But the passage speaks not at all of the tribulation, though it supposes nothing of the kind; but it does speak of the day of the Lord, and with instruction as to the portion of the saints, which shews that it can have in no way whatever to do with them.<a name=117:10></a> They are of it and to come in its power.<a name=117:11></a> All it says is -- The day will overtake them as a thief: but it will not overtake <i>you</i>, for ye are of the day.<a name=117:12></a> It says nothing of times and seasons, but negatives the application of the well-known truth to them.<a name=117:13></a>

	</div>

		The rapture of the saints to meet the Lord in the air, before His manifestation to the earth, and the existence of a Jewish remnant, in whom the Spirit of God is graciously working, before the Lord manifests Himself to them for their deliverance, is happily attracting the attention of Christians.<a name=118:1></a> It has made sufficient way to be the occasion of a renewed opposition, which can only do good by urging serious Christians to examine the scriptures on the subject -- an examination, which will, under grace, spiritually enlarge their apprehensions on many most important points, full of blessing and interest for their souls.<a name=118:2></a> The true character of the church of God will appear, and the nature of its connection with Christ, on the one hand, and the ways of God in the government of the world on the other -- the two great topics of which the Scriptures treat; besides that first of all concerns, the reconciling of the soul with God.<a name=118:3></a> On this last also, indeed, a right intelligence of the other two casts abundant light.<a name=118:4></a> The rapture of the saints before the appearing of Christ, strange as it may appear to some, has nothing to say to the church, directly or exclusively; but as we form part of those caught up, it, of course, interests us in the highest degree.<a name=118:5></a><a href="#118:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> The rapture is in connection with the glory of the kingdom; and the saints in general, who are to reign in the kingdom, have part in this rapture.<a name=118:6></a> Still, indirectly, the enquiry leads to the question, What is the church?<a name=118:7></a> because the doctrine of the rapture of the saints, before the appearing of Christ, connects itself with the existence of a Jewish remnant waiting for deliverance after the rapture and before the appearing;

		Those who believe in the rapture of the church before the appearing of Christ hold that the church has a special and peculiar character and connection with Christ, in virtue of its being formed into one body by the descent of the Holy Ghost from heaven; and that, while salvation is always necessarily the same, the relative condition of the saints previously was a distinct one.<a name=119:2></a> They are convinced that in the Psalms a Jewish remnant is found, and that thoughts, feelings, hopes, fears, into which the Spirit of Christ enters prophetically with and for them, are there expressed in their behalf.<a name=119:3></a> This remnant is believed to be continually spoken of in the prophets, as existing before the appearing of the Lord, and waiting for that appearing, and delivered by it.<a name=119:4></a> But, further, the Lord Himself being a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, as well as a Saviour, presented Himself necessarily to Israel, according to these promises, and became associated with the remnant, and the leader of it, as far as it was awakened to know Him.<a name=119:5></a> Hence the interpretation of many passages of the New Testament also became involved in this question; and, indeed, the whole order of the dispensations of God.<a name=119:6></a> But above all, the question of the church and its privileges, as formed by the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven, is important and essential in this matter, and a right understanding of it a key to the interpretation of the word of God.<a name=119:7></a>

		On the other hand, the denial of the existence of a Jewish remnant, such as is above spoken of, involves the most grave and, indeed, fatal consequences; because it connects, especially through the contents of the Psalms, the Spirit of Christ, which speaks in them, with the ungodly and unconverted Jews, and makes the declarations of integrity and uprightness, not the breathings of a righteous soul pleading with God -- yea, its pleadings furnished to it by the Spirit of Christ -- but the pride of self-righteousness presenting itself to God.<a name=119:8></a> It is hard to suppose that any could allege that the Lord should give all this self-righteousness by revelation in connection with -- yea, identified with -- the breathings of Christ's Spirit and the piety flowing from it; but such is the theory of those who deny the rapture of the saints before Christ's appearing, and, consequently, the existence of a Jewish remnant, in which

		A point connected with this has been insisted on by the adversaries of the truth, to which I advert here only to leave it aside, as not touching the main point, even if true, and used by them only to obscure the great and vital truth of the rapture of the church -- I mean the secrecy of the rapture.<a name=120:2></a> The two points on which it is important to have the clear testimony of Scripture are -- first, that there will be a Jewish remnant at the end, with a place belonging to itself as such; secondly, the true character of the church of God.<a name=120:3></a>

		Let us now see if this doctrine of a remnant is constantly recognised in the prophetic testimony, and in what way.<a name=125:2></a> Isaiah, a prophet who unfolds to us the ways of God with Israel as a whole, will abundantly instruct us on this point.<a name=125:3></a> The general principle, which connects the remnant with all God's moral dealings with Israel, is found in chapter 1: 18, 19.<a name=125:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before I proceed to quote the passages in detail, let me here state the great principles which this first citation suggests.<a name=125:5></a> I have already noticed that, after the question of personal salvation or relationship to God, two great subjects present themselves to us in Scripture: the church, that sovereign grace which gives us a place along with Christ Himself in glory and blessing; and God's government of the world, of which Israel forms the centre and the immediate sphere.<a name=125:6></a> Only we have to remember that in this government grace must have a part, or it would not be the government of God.<a name=125:7></a> It would be simple judicial condemnation, and impossibility of blessing.<a name=125:8></a> These ways of God are revealed in Exodus 32, 33, 34, and Deuteronomy 32.<a name=125:9></a> The prophets, founding themselves on the law given in Horeb, are sent in grace to seek the fruit which the vine of the Lord's planting ought to have borne.<a name=125:10></a> They reproach Israel with not producing it; and solemnly warn the people of the consequences in judgment.<a name=125:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But as God, and therefore grace, was at work, there were the purposes and will of that grace to be revealed: only that it was not in Israel's case made effectual in a simple sovereign gift to the divine glory in a new creation, but in a display of God's ways in divine government in connection with the responsibility of man.<a name=125:12></a> This grace must be in Christ, for He is the centre of all God's ways.<a name=125:13></a> He is the Messiah, then, of the Jews, the King that is to reign in righteousness, and to display fully and in perfection God's immediate government.<a name=125:14></a> (See Psalm 101.<a name=125:15></a>) Hence there is a double test applicable in the ways of God in government in Israel.<a name=125:16></a> Have they profited by and glorified God in the privileges, in the enjoyment of which they were originally placed?<a name=125:17></a> Are they in a condition to meet Jehovah in glory, coming in the Person of Christ?<a name=125:18></a> These two questions may be seen treated in Isaiah 5 and 6.<a name=125:19></a>

		Now, the whole of this process of government is unfolded in Isaiah: in the early part, before the history of Hezekiah, in judgment, and connected with all God's ways, and the national condition ending in the millennial glory and blessing in connection with Emmanuel the Ring; in the second part, after the history of Hezekiah, in grace, shewing that Israel had failed in maintaining Jehovah's glory as His servant, that Jehovah had substituted Christ come in humiliation as His servant, "the true vine," and that He (rejected and despised of men) would inherit the Gentiles also.<a name=126:13></a> The restoration of Israel was a small thing; but still God would, in and with the remnant, bring in the final glory of Jerusalem and His people.<a name=126:14></a>

		What is so important in this passage is, that while the church's position, undoubtedly assumed subsequently by the remnant who adhered to Christ, is passed over, their connection with Israel's hopes, and the accomplishment of Israel's hopes, are fully established through Him who teaches them to look to Him who hides His face from the house of Jacob, and wait for Him; for church blessings and grace they had not to wait.<a name=128:24></a> The church still waits for the accomplishment of this also;

		I have gone through these prophecies that the reader may clearly see that the doctrine of a Jewish remnant (owned in this character by Jehovah, with Jewish hopes pressed on them by God's word, by Jehovah Himself -- hopes to be fulfilled in the possession of earthly blessings in Zion, the holy land) -- a remnant, pious, and waiting on Jehovah before His appearing to deliver them, and whose piety and confidence are owned by Him -- is not a matter of speculation, or of the interpretation of some difficult or obscure text; but the clear, constant, impressive, and prominent testimony of the Spirit of God.<a name=134:7></a> He may have seen, too, that this remnant is directly and immediately connected, in character and in the divine testimony, with the position and character of the remnant at the time of Christ's presence on the earth, though meanwhile, for other purposes, the Lord may hide His face from the house of Jacob.<a name=134:8></a>

		The Psalms will afford us the thoughts and feelings of this remnant in the double aspect of the righteous in connection with Jehovah, and the purposes of God as to His anointed, Christ -- respectively the subjects of Psalms 1 and 2.<a name=134:9></a> The gospels will afford us (only that John's from its very nature treats the Jews from chapter 1 as reprobate) the transition to the previously hidden counsels of God as to the church -- which last forms the second subject we have to treat of.<a name=134:10></a>

		But another scene is opened out before it is accomplished.<a name=135:9></a> The godly man (and Christ, as such) finds himself a prey to the relentless hostilities of the ungodly.<a name=135:10></a> In Psalms 3-7 we have the various relative feelings of the faith of the remnant in this position -- faith in spite of the taunts of enemies as to apparent desertion, calling upon God in peaceful confidence, appeal to God in contrast with the wicked, the distress so strong that God's chastening in displeasure is deprecated, and appeal against the wicked in this distress, looking to God's bringing it to an end as the righteous Judge.<a name=135:11></a> Then, in Psalm 8, the remnant own Jehovah their Lord as having made His name excellent in all the earth, while the Son of man, rejected when He came as Messiah,<a href="#135:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> is set over all the works of His hands: that is, the full universal dominion of Christ is owned.<a name=135:12></a>

		Now we have the remnant here very distinctly, and Jehovah their Lord; but we have the godly man.<a name=135:13></a> In Psalm 1, the righteous is plural in verse 6.<a name=135:14></a> But what undoubtedly is specially presented is Christ's entering in spirit, as the true godly one, into all the sorrows of the righteous remnant, which, though stated in principle, and specially in principle from Christ's first coming (when the position of the godly remnant and the rebellion of the nation were definitely and in their full character brought out), reach on to the final destruction

		Thus the general character of the book (more correctly of the five books of Psalms, in which there is much more method than is supposed) is clearly given.<a name=136:4></a> It is the position of the godly remnant in Israel, and Christ entering in spirit wholly and fully into the position of this remnant, sometimes animating their feelings according to His mind in them in it, while sometimes the Spirit rises up to the expression of His own, as entered personally into it, so that what is there said becomes direct prophecy as to Christ Himself.<a name=136:5></a> The Lord, entering fully in grace (for in all their affliction He was afflicted) into their trial, appropriates more than once language which is also true and applicable in the mouth of the remnant, though sometimes, as we have seen, it is exclusively Himself.<a name=136:6></a> In all, it is His Spirit graciously furnishing the expression of sorrows and desires in the trial by His perfect sympathy, or of which He is the source -- sorrows and desires into which He has so personally entered, that often the terms employed belong prophetically to Him.<a name=136:7></a>

		To proceed (Psalms 9 and 10), the trial and judgment of the last days are definitely gone into, and the state of the remnant plainly set forth; the needy expectations of the poor would not always be forgotten.<a name=136:8></a> The connection of the Lord with the remnant, and their praise for deliverance, is unfolded in Psalm 9; the extensive power of wickedness and distress of the remnant in Psalm 10; but the general subject and result is the same.<a name=136:9></a> In Psalms 11-15 the various thoughts, feelings, and apprehensions of the remnant in these circumstances are developed, Psalm 15 shewing the Jewish character of godliness which shall find its place in God's holy hill.<a name=136:10></a> All this, and its unquestionable carrying on of the subject to the last days (for we have in Psalm 8 the full final exaltation of Christ and blessing of Israel under the glory of Jehovah's

		This is completed in Psalms 16 and 17, especially the first, by Christ's definitely taking this place of association with the godly remnant, as He did historically when He was baptised with John's baptism (the submission to which, on the part of the remnant, was the first expression of the action of the Spirit of God in their separating in view of the thoroughly purging of the Jewish floor).<a name=137:2></a> In the path of that action, Christ, who surely needed no repentance, at once goes with them.<a name=137:3></a> The principle laid down in the beginning of this Psalm is brought forward in the epistle to the Hebrews,<a href="#137:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> to shew that "both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one.<a name=137:4></a>" In the Psalm, Christ says, I take the place of a servant to Jehovah, not My divine place.<a name=137:5></a> He says to Jehovah, Thou art My Lord; My goodness extendeth not to Thee.<a name=137:6></a> He says (for that is the connection) to the saints on earth, the excellent, In them is all My delight.<a name=137:7></a> Having taken this path, and owning, leaning on, and desiring none but Jehovah, He follows the path of life, does not see corruption, and finds His eternal joy as Man in the presence and at the right hand of Jehovah.<a name=137:8></a> As Psalm 16 was His trust in God, so Psalm 17 is His appeal to His righteousness.<a name=137:9></a> He will behold His face in righteousness and be satisfied, awaking up in His likeness, the true eternal image of the invisible God.<a name=137:10></a> But here He brings in the remnant as associated with Him in His sorrow.<a name=137:11></a> In Psalm 16: 2, it is absolutely Himself passing through death in the power of life.<a name=137:12></a> Mainly so in Psalm 17; only He associates the rest of the godly with Himself.<a name=137:13></a>

		I will close this rapid review of the early Psalms with noticing Psalms 23 and 24.<a name=138:9></a> Psalm 23 as shewing Jehovah's faithful shepherd care through every difficulty, now exercised in our favour by Christ, is in principle the portion of every believer; but as He knows His sheep and is known of them, so He has walked in the path in which the sheep had to walk, and when He put them forth, went before them; and though the place of sheep was properly still theirs, not His, yet He has really walked in it; and, in that sense, this Psalm is the expression of His own confidence.<a name=138:10></a> Restoring is not exclusively from sin -- though He does that for us, but from sorrow and oppression of heart; as, "now is my soul troubled and what shall I say?<a name=138:11></a> Father, save me from this hour.<a name=138:12></a>" In Psalm 24 we find, that He who has walked in the path of the sheep themselves in grace is the Lord of Hosts Himself; and in the last day will take His place in glory in the hill and in the house of the glory of Jehovah.<a name=138:13></a> The character of him who shall have a place there, and blessing and righteousness from the God of his salvation, is found in verses 3-6.<a name=138:14></a> For the righteous remnant are all forgotten; only here, I apprehend, it goes out to Gentiles (so verses 5 and 6 seem to imply), for they shall rejoice in that day with His people.<a name=138:15></a> From this to Psalm 41, which closes the book (Psalm 40 giving the source of all the blessings in the counsels of God, and the willingness of Christ to undertake the accomplishment of His will), are largely and blessedly unfolded the various exercises of heart in confidence,

		In this part, consequently (for it is never the case before Psalm 25), sins are referred to, and the blessedness of forgiveness; for, after all, the remnant had sins, and Christ took them.<a name=139:2></a> But the true godly character of the remnant, as under the influence of Christ's Spirit, is what is put forward in the first place as the true essential characteristic of the book, and of the position of those who are its immediate subjects.<a name=139:3></a> Even in Psalm 22, where the fact of God's forsaking is spoken of, the "Why?<a name=139:4></a>" shews the perfectly righteous man.<a name=139:5></a> Through grace we can answer the "Why?<a name=139:6></a>" but in the Psalm itself Christ is the righteous sufferer forsaken of God.<a name=139:7></a> Of Psalm 6 we can say, that the occasion of such fear to us would be our sins; but sins are not spoken of there -- it was grief: but the wicked who pressed him he sends away, as apart from them.<a name=139:8></a> In a word, sins are not spoken of before Psalm 25.<a name=139:9></a> This is after the whole introductory part of the connection of Christ with the remnant.<a name=139:10></a> Thence to the end of Psalm 41 every kind of practical exercise is gone through to which the remnant will be in fact subject, of which they need the exposition from God; but it is always of the godly these Psalms speak, even when forgiveness is sought or sins confessed.<a name=139:11></a> They acquaint us with the circumstances of the godly remnant in the latter day, though often on principles which all, by grace, can use.<a name=139:12></a> See Psalms 35 and 37.<a name=139:13></a>

		Remark also the essential difference between the sufferings of Christ from man and from God; the first were for righteousness, the second for sin.<a name=139:14></a> The consequence of the first (Psalm 21) is, that He will make His enemies as a fiery oven in the day of His wrath.<a name=139:15></a> In the second He was bearing wrath: the consequence is all unmingled blessing, and nothing else, as its fruit.<a name=139:16></a> (See Psalm 22: 11-23.<a name=139:17></a>)

		In the closing book, <i>the fifth</i>, we have various consequences and effects on the bringing back of Israel -- explanatory Psalms of the scheme of God, as Psalm 110; the law written on Israel's heart, Psalm 119; the Psalms of degrees commenting on God's ways; and then the praises of God, with their various grounds, and pursued in view of millennial blessedness.<a name=141:10></a>

		that they may enjoy it (which we learn in the second and fourth books); that the ascension and sitting at God's right hand precede these blessings, Christ returning to judgment to bring them in -- returning withal as Jehovah, and entering into the temple as such -- assuring all things to Israel as David's seed, having all things under His feet as Son of man, and while King in Zion, subjecting all the nations as Son of God born in this world.<a name=142:1></a> The name of the Father and the thought of the church do not appear: room is left for one after His resurrection, when He calls the saints brethren; and some figure of the other in Psalm 139, but no direct reference to either.<a name=142:2></a> The Holy Ghost's work, as come down from heaven, is intimated in the form of gifts in man, but so as Israel also will have them in the latter day -- "Yea, for the rebellious also, that the Lord God may dwell among them" -- only so far, however, intimated, as to say that Christ has received gifts for men.<a name=142:3></a>

		Such is the testimony of the Psalms.<a name=142:4></a> While ministering to piety at all times, though often a piety with imperfect intelligence, their subject is the remnant of Israel, and the blessings of that remnant as such, of course, through Christ, the ministrations of His Spirit, preparing them to enjoy it with earthly though divinely given hopes, and in an earthly way.<a name=142:5></a> Note here, too, that all this connects itself with God's government of this world, and in no way with that sovereign grace, which sets a sinner in heavenly glory as one with Christ Himself, and a member of His body.<a name=142:6></a> But a heavenly calling is shewn in Him, and the possibility of passing to it by death; but it is only stated as to the Person of Christ directly, or in the general expression, "The heavens shall declare his righteousness.<a name=142:7></a>"

		What we have now to enquire into, is the extent to which the New Testament seals these hopes and promises to Israel, while introducing higher and heavenly hopes.<a name=142:8></a> For it is absolutely impossible that it can set them aside.<a name=142:9></a> It does not undo what God had before promised and assured to His people; that is certain and evident.<a name=142:10></a> "The gifts and calling of God are without repentance.<a name=142:11></a>" It is said, in speaking of Israel, Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made to the fathers.<a name=142:12></a> Has His rejection and death set them aside?<a name=142:13></a> Far from it.<a name=142:14></a> It is just this the apostle insists on in Romans 11.<a name=142:15></a> It has made their accomplishment to be of pure grace, and has secured that accomplishment.<a name=142:16></a>

		The beginning of the gospel of Luke announces Christ fully as thus coming in connection with Israel, before entering on the wider moral ground connected with the Gentiles, which Luke more especially does, and I think we may say because he does.<a name=143:3></a> The Spirit of God, at the commencement of this gospel, has put His seal on all the promises to, and hopes of, the godly remnant (that is, of Israel).<a name=143:4></a> The pious remnant were looking for redemption in Jerusalem, and knew one another thus; Luke 2: 38.<a name=143:5></a> There were just and devout ones waiting for the consolation of Israel, who saw in Christ a light indeed to reveal the Gentiles, but the glory of God's people Israel.<a name=143:6></a> The angels brought good tidings to the shepherds, which were such to all the people (not all people).<a name=143:7></a> In the city of David a Saviour was born to them, which was Christ the Lord.<a name=143:8></a> The angels of the heavenly chorus alone, in this part of the gospel, celebrate the full result of Christ's coming to the earth -- a result not yet produced, but, as the Lord Himself states, for the present the contrary, but which will be produced fully on the earth hereafter.<a name=143:9></a>

		Prophetically, it was declared that many of Israel should be turned to the Lord their God, through him who came in the spirit and power of Elias: he was to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.<a name=143:10></a> Note the last expression, for it gives the divine intention as to any Elias service, and what the essential character of the remnant is.<a name=143:11></a> It is not sovereign grace visiting a sinner of the Gentiles in his sins, but a people prepared for the Lord before He comes.<a name=143:12></a> To Mary it is announced that the child born of her on the earth should be called the Son of the Highest, and that the throne of His father David should be given Him.<a name=143:13></a> He was Jesus, i.<a name=143:14></a>e.<a name=143:15></a>, Jehovah the Saviour.<a name=143:16></a> Help to His servant Israel is the final subject of praise with Mary in the touching and beautiful interview between her and Elizabeth.<a name=143:17></a> And the song of Zacharias (Luke 1: 67-79) is wholly composed of the divinely-given celebration of God's having visited and redeemed His people, and raised up a horn of salvation for

		I pass by a multitude of indications of the same relationship of God with Israel, accompanied with warnings of the introduction of the new order of things, to draw my reader's attention to a chapter which brings the point which occupies us out into the fullest light.<a name=145:4></a> In chapter 10 Christ sends out the twelve.<a name=145:5></a> They were not to go in the way of the Gentiles, nor to enter into a city of the Samaritans; but to go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, and declare the kingdom of heaven at hand; to enquire who was worthy (i.<a name=145:6></a>e.<a name=145:7></a>, seek the righteous remnant, not poor sinners), and repel with fullest condemnation, shaking off the dust of their feet, those who did not receive them.<a name=145:8></a> Though in Israel they were "as sheep in the midst of wolves": it was an ungodly nation.<a name=145:9></a> They were to seek the worthy ones in it, speaking peace everywhere, but that peace resting only on the sons of peace.<a name=145:10></a> But in verse 18 this goes on to circumstances out of the Lord's lifetime.<a name=145:11></a> They were to be brought before Gentiles, and the Spirit of their Father to speak in them; not only so, but they would be hated of all men for Christ's name sake, and when persecuted in one city, go to another; for they would not have gone over the cities of Israel till the Son of man was come.<a name=145:12></a>

		Now here we have a mission exclusively to Israel, carried on during the Lord's lifetime, carried on by the Spirit afterwards, in which they were to endure to the end -- a ministry which would not be closed nor completed, and still confined to the cities of Israel, till the Son of man came.<a name=145:13></a> How often do we see the prophets passing on from some notable circumstances in their day to "that day"!<a name=145:14></a> Here we find the Lord establishing a ministry exclusively to Israel, drawing out the remnant; carried on after Him by the Spirit, and carried on with the same objects still unfinished even when He comes as Son of man.<a name=145:15></a> They have only to do with Gentiles as enemies, along with the wicked and hostile nation of the Jews.<a name=145:16></a> Nothing can be plainer in all its parts.<a name=145:17></a> They were, according to Jewish hopes and prospects, to gather out a remnant and prepare a people for the kingdom which was at hand.<a name=145:18></a> Such is the direct teaching of the Lord.<a name=145:19></a>

		As regards the subsequent continuation of this testimony in the midst of Jerusalem the Lord on the cross (Luke 23: 34) intercedes for them, saying, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.<a name=148:4></a>" To this the Holy Ghost, in witness, responds, saying by the mouth of Peter (Acts 3: 17), "Now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers.<a name=148:5></a> Repent ye, therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, so that [not "when"] the times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord; and he shall send Jesus, whom the heaven must receive till the times of the restitution of all things, of which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.<a name=148:6></a>" Now, this gracious continuation of the testimony to Israel, as such (see verses 25, 26 -- the remnant is distinguished by the reception of the testimony, verse 23), shews that repentance was called for in order to Christ's return.<a name=148:7></a> Those would be cut off who did not receive his prophetic testimony.<a name=148:8></a> Stephen bears witness to their always resisting the Holy Ghost; and to Saul, the most active resister of the Spirit amongst them, the willing helper of the slayers of the witness, the full doctrine of the church is revealed.<a name=148:9></a> The persecuted witnesses are owned to be members of Christ Himself; yet, though the church be set up (and we have it in fact in Acts 2 before Peter's testimony), and Paul be made a minister of it, he preaches first to the Jews only; when they count themselves unworthy of eternal life, he turns to the Gentiles, and pronounces, as witness of this church ministry, as the Lord in His living witness here (Matthew 13: 14), that the judgment pronounced by Isaiah must soon fall upon them; but it is only in Acts 28 that this is finally said -- the last scriptural witness that we have historically.<a name=148:10></a>

		In a word, the church, or assembly, is the body of Christ, formed, when the Head was exalted, by the Holy Ghost, which He then sent down to gather together the saints into unity Before Israel's being owned as a nation, the saints walked in individual faith; when Israel was owned, they were individual members of a nation owned as such as God's people, but of which the vast mass were unconverted, the unity of which, such as it was, was in the flesh -- a unity with which the Spirit had nothing to do, and which, consequently excluded Gentiles.<a name=152:5></a> After the death and exaltation of Christ, who gave Himself, not for that nation only, but to gather together in one the children of God which were scattered abroad, all was changed in this respect; the distinction of Jew and Gentiles effaced; both alike (through faith) reconciled to God, and gathered into the unity of one assembly by the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven, which assembly is the church, i.<a name=152:6></a>e.<a name=152:7></a>, the assembly of God, the body of Christ, the dwelling-place of the Holy Ghost on earth.<a name=152:8></a> We are not enquiring here how far it could be corrupted or ruined, viewed as the house of God, or dwelling-place of the Holy Ghost on earth; but what it is in the primitive scriptural view of it.<a name=152:9></a> Nothing is that but itself.<a name=152:10></a>

		Thirdly, besides the facts of Christ's coming and manifested righteousness, there is, through grace, special privilege, the proper association of the saints with Christ, which must have their accomplishment also.<a name=155:4></a> No doubt the saints will be manifested before the judgment-seat of Christ, to give an account of themselves to God; but this is not separated from privilege, for they arrive there already like Himself.<a name=155:5></a> Yea, He has come Himself to fetch them there.<a name=155:6></a> This special association with Christ is made good, not by Christ's appearing, as we have seen (though manifested there), but by His coming to receive them to Himself where He is; His introducing them into His Father's house, and in the kingdom placing them in the heavenly seat of government with Himself.<a name=155:7></a> This is effectuated by His coming, and causing them, raised or changed, to come up and meet Him in the air.<a name=155:8></a> This is the rapture of the saints, preceding their and Christ's appearing: at that they appear with Him.<a name=155:9></a> So that at their rapture He has I not appeared yet.<a name=155:10></a>

		Although the question be already answered in principle, it may be well to put it formally here, When is the Christian to expect the Lord?<a name=156:9></a> I answer, Always.<a name=156:10></a> It is his right spiritual character.<a name=156:11></a> His always doing it is that by which his right spiritual state is characterised.<a name=156:12></a> Be ye "as men that wait for their Lord when he shall return from the wedding, that they may open to him immediately.<a name=156:13></a> Blessed are those servants whom the Lord, when he cometh, shall find watching.<a name=156:14></a> Verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them .<a name=156:15></a>.<a name=156:16></a>.<a name=156:17></a> .<a name=156:18></a> Be ye therefore ready also, for at such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.<a name=156:19></a>" And, after speaking of service to the saints, the Lord adds, "Blessed is that servant whom his Lord when he cometh, shall find so doing.<a name=156:20></a> Of a truth, I say unto you, He will make him ruler over all that he hath.<a name=156:21></a> But and if that servant say in his heart, My Lord delayeth his coming and begin to beat the men-servants and the maid-servants he will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers.<a name=156:22></a>" Here, as a general principle, the constant waiting for the Lord as a present thing is given as characterising those who are blessed when the Lord comes, and who reign over all things.<a name=156:23></a> That which leads the wicked servant into all mischief is, not the denial of the Lord's coming, but the loss of the sense and present expectation of it.<a name=156:24></a>

		That the apostle lived in, and taught, this immediate expectation, as the proper primitive doctrine of the Spirit of God, is evident, whatever degree of light as to detail may have been possessed.<a name=157:12></a> The Thessalonians were converted to wait for God's Son from heaven; with very little clearness of light; but they had been so taught, and Paul approves of their expectation as a divine witness to the world, of which the world itself spake.<a name=157:13></a> It was his manner of entering in -- they were waiting for Him.<a name=157:14></a> It was not a prophetic explanation of events they possessed: there is no event, I repeat, between us and heaven.<a name=157:15></a> God's Son was coming from heaven; and they were waiting for Him as the fruit of Paul's entering in among them, owned and delighted in by himself.<a name=157:16></a> They drew certain conclusions from it in which they erred, which Paul corrected (as he did another mistake, induced by false teachers, in the second epistle); but their constant expectation was right.<a name=157:17></a> The word even is used only here, and speaks of awaiting; but Paul was doing as much.<a name=157:18></a> He speaks to them of "we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord.<a name=157:19></a>" We are told this is a class.<a name=157:20></a> Be it so.<a name=157:21></a> But it is a class in which Paul reckons himself, shewing that that class could and ought so to await the coming of the Lord.<a name=157:22></a> Why not we?<a name=157:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But there were, as we have seen, errors.<a name=157:24></a> The Thessalonians were distressed about those who perished for Jesus’ sake; fearing, as it appears (so much did they expect Christ in their life-time), that they would not be there to enjoy His coming.<a name=157:25></a> Paul corrects this error, by shewing that the dead would be raised, and then the living go up to meet Christ with them.<a name=157:26></a> But he is so far from weakening the Thessalonians’ present

		expectation of Christ during their life-time, that he confirms it by associating himself with them in this expectation.<a name=158:1></a> The circumstance, that it was a conclusion drawn from this expectation which misled the Thessalonians so that they were troubled about the saints' dying, gives uncommon force to the statement of the apostle.<a name=158:2></a> How anxiously would he have set them right, had they been wrong on this, and shewn them that he never had led them, nor meant to have led them, to such an expectation -- that it was an excited and erroneous way of looking at the Lord's coming!<a name=158:3></a> How would he have shewn them (the occasion and need of correcting error being thus offered), as do many now, that there were many events to occur, much history of the church and world to be accomplished, before the Lord could come!<a name=158:4></a> But, quite the contrary, he corrects the mistake they did make as to the dead, shewing them that they should first rise; and they, being changed, all go up together on high; and confirms in the strongest way their own present expectation by, as I have said, associating himself with it.<a name=158:5></a> Was he deceived, as rationalists allege, in having and confirming in others this thought?<a name=158:6></a> Surely not.<a name=158:7></a> The moment was not revealed, as we know: the constant expectation was right.<a name=158:8></a> It produced a liveliness of expectation, a courage in persecution, a brightness of heart-association with the Lord's Person and personal approval, of which Paul will reap the blessed fruits when the moment does come -- of which the Thessalonians did reap the fruits every day, in the liveliness of their faith, and the brightness of their hope, and the labour of their love -- and of which we do: in a witness of liveliness of affection and liberty of heart, and superiority to circumstances, of which no epistle in Scripture affords a like example.<a name=158:9></a> Would there were a little more enthusiasm in Christians, if it be founded on a hope sanctioned by the apostle himself!<a name=158:10></a>

		But those circumstances to which the Thessalonians were exposed, were very trying; and if lively, they were young in the faith.<a name=158:11></a> They had heard that the day of the Lord would come -- a terrible day of trouble and of judgment.<a name=158:12></a> False teachers came and sought to upset their minds, alleging even a letter of Paul, and declarations of the Spirit, that that day was there.<a name=158:13></a> If hope was somewhat enfeebled by their sufferings, as perhaps was the case (as the apostle speaks only of their faith and love here), this unsettling of their minds is not difficult to conceive, entirely inexperienced as they were, and subjected to trial.<a name=158:14></a>

		But the Lord was there to help them, as the wicked one to trouble them.<a name=159:1></a> It is to be remarked that the verse translated (2 Thessalonians 2), "as that the day of the Lord is at hand," should be, beyond all controversy or question, "as that the day of the Lord were present.<a name=159:2></a>" It is the word translated elsewhere <i>present</i>, in contrast with things to come.<a name=159:3></a> They were troubled and upset by the impression that the day of the Lord, that great and terrible day, was actually come.<a name=159:4></a> No wonder the apostle could not speak of their hope.<a name=159:5></a> Before the apostle touches on their mistake, and unfolds the true order of events, with heavenly skill he sets their minds at ease.<a name=159:6></a> This he does in the first chapter.<a name=159:7></a> He glories in their patience and faith in their persecutions.<a name=159:8></a> It was a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to those that troubled them, and to them that were troubled rest with Paul and others (he was associated in the sorrow and the rest too) when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven in flaming fire to take vengeance on them that know not God, and obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, when He shall come to be glorified in His saints, and admired in (not "to receive to himself") all them that believe (for the Thessalonians had believed) in that day.<a name=159:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here all is set in its place.<a name=159:10></a> It was Christ's appearing in glory which would bring in the day.<a name=159:11></a> If that day had been then present, it was without Christ.<a name=159:12></a> If His appearing brought it in, He was not going to trouble those that were His, but surely those who troubled them.<a name=159:13></a> That was a righteous matter with God; so that the terrible persecution the Thessalonians were undergoing was but a pledge with a righteous God that, when the kingdom came, they would have rest and glory.<a name=159:14></a> They would not have trouble when Christ appeared, and when the kingdom was established by judgment.<a name=159:15></a> In that day their portion would be ease and delight; nay, indeed, more than that -- they would be the admiration of the world, or rather Christ in them, in that day.<a name=159:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus, by introducing Christ and God's righteous ways, all was as clear as possible, and the delusion dispelled.<a name=159:17></a> The Thessalonians' minds were re-established It is ever so: introduce Christ and God's ways, and all is clear and peace.<a name=159:18></a> They can now, calmly and with a restored soul, in which known truths had their place, receive fresh and satisfying light on the point which troubled them.<a name=159:19></a> The moment we see that

		It has been supposed that "rest .<a name=160:2></a>.<a name=160:3></a>.<a name=160:4></a> when" means the moment of relief.<a name=160:5></a> Nothing is more unfounded.<a name=160:6></a> The reasoning of the apostle is that, Christ introducing the day, it was not when He had the upper hand that His people would be troubled and ill-treated.<a name=160:7></a> Was He going to treat them so?<a name=160:8></a> In the day exactly the contrary would be the case: they would enjoy rest and blessing; the persecutors would be troubled.<a name=160:9></a> The Greek used for <i>rest</i> by no means conveys always the same meaning of a moment of relaxation arriving; it is never so used in Scripture.<a name=160:10></a> The other passages are Acts 24: 23; 2 Corinthians 2: 12; chapter 7: 5; chapter 8: 13.<a name=160:11></a> It is used in the same sense here.<a name=160:12></a> In 2 Corinthians 8: 13, the Greek words for 'burden,' 'tribulation,' and 'rest,' are in a similar opposition as here in 2 Thessalonians 1: 6, 7.<a name=160:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We come now to the very easy understanding of 2 Thessalonians 2, in which to the relieved Thessalonians the apostle unfolds, by fresh instructions, the order in which events will really take place.<a name=160:14></a> I only remark, before turning to it, that if "rest with us" meant relief at the moment of the revealing of Christ, it would mean that the Thessalonians and Paul were to expect Christ's appearing in their lifetime, as the term of their trials, and the moment of their rest.<a name=160:15></a> This reply would be complete and absolute to those who allege this; but it would not be the truth, nor scriptural.<a name=160:16></a> It is not the force of the Greek here, nor is it the meaning of the passage, nor would such an expectation, using the same Greek word in this way be a scripturally enlightened one, such as an inspired apostle would give.<a name=160:17></a> It proves the absurdity of their reasoning, but no more.<a name=160:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards 2 Thessalonians 2, as I have said, the apostle unfolds additional truth.<a name=160:19></a> He had already told the Thessalonians, that they would be caught up to meet the Lord in the air.<a name=160:20></a> Hence their being under the day of Christ on the earth was an absolute impossibility, since they would be in heaven, with the executor of the wrath of it, before it arrived.<a name=160:21></a> This motive he now pleads.<a name=160:22></a> They fancied (or at least were unsettled as to it by the false teachers) that the day was actually come -- consequently, without Christ's coming.<a name=160:23></a> Hence he says, "We beseech you, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our gathering together unto him, that ye be not soon shaken in

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thing which shewed the day was not then come (this supposition being the groundwork of all the apostle's reasoning, and, indeed, the occasion of the whole epistle) was, that the day would not come till the apostasy came, and the man of sin was revealed.<a name=161:7></a> Before the day of Christ could be present on the earth, events must occur -- the object of judgment must be there.<a name=161:8></a> Thus the mistakes of the Thessalonians only gave occasion to clearer and surer light.<a name=161:9></a> And here I must remark, that confounding the day of the Lord and His coming to receive the church is not a mere mistake in terms, but a subversion of the whole nature of the relationship between Christ and the church, and Christ and the world, an apostate world; and a losing sight wholly of the great moral bearing of a day coming on the world, of which the Old Testament is full as well as the New.<a name=161:10></a> To mix this up with "I will come again and receive you to myself, that where I am there ye may be also," is to confound the whole bearing of Christ's affections towards His own, with the terror of an apparition which every eye shall see -- a confounding the flaming fire of destructive judgment with the dearest confidences of perfect grace, and bringing down the hopes of the saints, founded on the all-perfect grace and truth of Christ, to the level of an event common to all, and terrible in its glory.<a name=161:11></a> It is the practical establishment of the error to correct which the second epistle to the Thessalonians was written.<a name=161:12></a> It not only sets aside the distinctive revelation of our being caught up to meet the Lord in the air, and the distinctive existence and position of the church with it; but it denies the position which (it is here, as elsewhere, revealed) we shall have with Christ when He appears.<a name=161:13></a> When He appears we shall appear with Him; He will come to be glorified in His saints, and admired in all them that believe (not to receive them up to Himself).<a name=161:14></a> The scripture is as plain as possible.<a name=161:15></a> He who confounds the day of Christ with His coming to receive the church knows neither what His day is, nor His coming, nor the church.<a name=161:16></a>

		ARE THERE TWO HALF-WEEKS IN THE APOCALYPSE?
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Dear Mr.<a name=168:1></a> Editor, <p>It has long been assumed that two half-weeks are spoken of in the Apocalypse.<a name=168:2></a> In this I have for years myself acquiesced, and I think rested on the contrast of the beast's overcoming the saints, and the witnesses destroying their enemies, as confirming this assumption.<a name=168:3></a> I hardly know how I was led some time back to call it in question; but I have been: and I should be glad to present the point as a question, in case you or your readers were given of God to throw any light upon it.<a name=168:4></a> Though strongly calling in question that two half-weeks are spoken of, my mind is still quite open to conviction; and I have nothing whatever to sustain in it, and desire only to know what the Spirit of God has really meant to teach us in the word as to it.<a name=168:5></a> I hardly know whether such a question enters into the object of the "Bible Treasury"; but it may elicit some light from others as to the matter.<a name=168:6></a> I shall give a kind of exposition of the subject from Scripture, considered from the point of view I have spoken of.<a name=168:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Seventy weeks are determined on Daniel's people and his holy city, to complete the blessing and close their eventful history -- the display of divine government in the earth.<a name=168:8></a> After seven and sixty-two weeks Messiah is cut off and has nothing.<a name=168:9></a> There are seven and sixty-two till Messiah the Prince.<a name=168:10></a> His cutting off is indefinite; only it is after the sixty-two weeks.<a name=168:11></a> Then the prince that comes establishes a covenant with the many (that is, the mass of the people).<a name=168:12></a> Messiah's relationship, on the contrary, had been with the residue, though presented to all the people.<a name=168:13></a> Then, in the dividing of the week, he causes the sacrifice and oblation to cease; and then, because of the protection of abominations (idols), there is a desolator.<a name=168:14></a> I give you Daniel as I understand it.<a name=168:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		nothing as to the church; rather, I think, the contrary -- makes its distinctive place more clear, though the church be heavenly We have, in Daniel, the saints of heavenlies, as belonging to, and connected with, these earthly questions, where there is not the smallest allusion to the church, where all is connected with the beasts and the true kingdom over the earth.<a name=170:1></a> Abraham was a heavenly saint, though he saw Christ's day and was glad He looked forward with joy to this, but was himself obliged to take it in another way.<a name=170:2></a> Such is the case supposed in the sermon on the mount.<a name=170:3></a> "The meek shall inherit the earth"; but the reward of the persecuted will be great in heaven.<a name=170:4></a> So in the Psalms, especially book 1 (Psalm 1-41), where even Christ is shewn the path of life (Psalm 16), so as to be in God's presence, and the saint (as Christ Himself) is satisfied (Psalm 17), waking up after Jehovah's likeness.<a name=170:5></a> Yet the remnant are promised earthly blessings very plainly and clearly.<a name=170:6></a> See Psalms 1, 37, whence the expression in Matthew 5 is drawn; so Psalm 34, and others, as Psalms 9, 10, and indeed also Psalm 8, shew.<a name=170:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The passages, then, in Daniel, as others, point out clearly a residue, who, connected with earthly things, and passing through them, but purified by trials out of them, and led to look up on high, have finally their portion there where they have been taught to look.<a name=170:8></a> But, in general, I apprehend their desire after heavenly things is more connected with weariness of heart in conflict while under the law -- for they are under the law -- though no doubt they do in spirit thereby dwell in heaven, for the enjoyment of which the new nature renders them capable.<a name=170:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the church, remark that in Ephesians 1 it is brought out quite apart from the full blessing of individuals, developed with such inexpressible beauty; first, in their calling; then, in the knowledge given them of the purpose of God to gather together all in one, in Christ, and in the inheritance obtained in Him.<a name=170:10></a> After that the apostle prays that they may understand these two points of God's calling and inheritance in the saints.<a name=170:11></a> But then he adds another demand, brought in addition, that they might know the exceeding greatness of His power, which He wrought in Christ, when He raised Him from the dead; and then first brings in the church as His body, the fulness of Him who fills all in all; thus giving the church, which He had not before spoken of, a peculiar place in union with Christ,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And here note that in Ephesians 1 Christ is considered as the exalted Man.<a name=171:5></a> The chapter speaks of His (God's) mighty power which He wrought in Christ.<a name=171:6></a> Christ is looked at as man, and subjected to death, and raised again by another, even God; that is, it is a Christ really living in time.<a name=171:7></a> When the forming of the body on earth by the Holy Ghost is spoken of, the word leads us to the same truth: "By one Spirit are we all baptised into one body," 1 Corinthians 12: 13.<a name=171:8></a> There is (Ephesians 4) "one body and one Spirit .<a name=171:9></a>.<a name=171:10></a>.<a name=171:11></a> one Lord, one faith, one baptism.<a name=171:12></a>" I go on to "one baptism," because it shews that the apostle is speaking of those who are brought in by the known death and resurrection of Christ.<a name=171:13></a> The testimony of 1 Corinthians is beyond controversy; and while the Ephesians shews individual privilege, in the highest way, as relationship, position, and character, making the individual the proper object of every ministration of the church, the more the Scriptures are searched into, the more the church -- the assembly -- will be seen to have a distinct and peculiar position, and to be a special and distinctive body.<a name=171:14></a> Hebrews 12 shews it very clearly.<a name=171:15></a> Thus, in the midst of the general assembly of heaven, "to an innumerable company of angels, the general assembly, and to the church of the firstborn whose names are written in heaven.<a name=171:16></a>" It is really forgotten that, unless the question of authorship be raised on the last mentioned passage, in the apostolic writings none ever speaks of "the church" but Paul.<a name=171:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I resume the points as to the half-weeks.<a name=171:18></a> Christ's connection with the first half-week is left entirely vague.<a name=171:19></a> Seventy weeks are determined on the city and the sanctuary to bring in blessing.<a name=171:20></a>

	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#171:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>The Colossians speaks only of the resurrection. This falls in with another point observable in this epistle: life, or the new nature, is referred to, rather than the Holy Ghost, as in the Ephesians; for the presence of the Holy Ghost depends on Christ's exaltation. This difference of the epistles, which I cannot follow out here, is full of instruction.

		It seems to me that we have the whole moral history of Israel, the purposes of God, and the accomplishment of them in Christ as regards this people, in the blessing of Jacob in Genesis 49.<a name=175:1></a> I can only briefly set it forth here.<a name=175:2></a> First, Israel as it was, and its moral failure in Reuben, Simeon, and Levi.<a name=175:3></a> The universal characters of the development of sin are given: corruption and violence; defiling and instruments of cruelty.<a name=175:4></a> God in the testimony of the Spirit rejects their assembly.<a name=175:5></a> The violent passions are the latter form.<a name=175:6></a> The beast is destroyed after Babylon.<a name=175:7></a> God's purposes are in Judah.<a name=175:8></a> The King, the Lawgiver, is there; the gathering of the peoples is to be to Him.<a name=175:9></a> But we know when presented to the responsibility of Israel He was rejected.<a name=175:10></a> There was no gathering of the peoples.<a name=175:11></a> The staves of Beauty and Bands were broken -- those by which the people were to be gathered and the two divisions of Israel united in one under one head.<a name=175:12></a> Then, in Zebulun and Issachar, Israel is presented as mixed up with the world, like Tyre in Ezekiel, and content to be subject to strangers for ease, as if they were not God's people at all.<a name=175:13></a> Dan is still, in spite of all, owned, and represents Israel recognized as God's portion in spite of all, but at the same time points out the apostasy and power of Satan in Israel.<a name=175:14></a> The remnant, taught of God, look beyond the whole position of the people to God's own salvation, who cannot but be faithful to His word.<a name=175:15></a> Thereupon we have unmingled blessing, crowned with the heavenly and earthly glory of a rejected Christ -- channel of all the resources of God's blessing to His people beyond all previous knowledge of blessing.<a name=175:16></a> Israel had been overcome, but overcomes at the last.<a name=175:17></a> Asher (not like Zebulun) has his fatness in his own pastures, and royal dainties are there.<a name=175:18></a> In Naphtali is joyful liberty -- the liberty God has given, and full of goodly words.<a name=175:19></a> Then comes the crown of all -- the rejected one of his brethren sorely tried and shot at: Christ -- personally considered the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel made strong by the power of God, exalted when rejected, to be at the King's right hand and Head over the Gentiles -- is the exhaustless source of every divine blessing with which the heart of man can be made glad; all richly coming from God are upon the crown of the head of

		THE COMING OF THE LORD AND THE TRANSLATION OF THE CHURCH¦
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Direct testimony to the existence of a Jewish remnant with Jewish hopes, sanctioned of the Lord, having been published elsewhere, and the doctrine of the church also having been briefly brought out, as connected with the Lord's coming, the object here is to examine, in a supplementary notice, some difficulties which a serious mind might find in the suggestions of those who oppose the rapture of the church.<a name=177:1></a> It is true that if the statements of Scripture be adequately weighed, and the truths which have been drawn from it received into the heart, the answer to all these difficulties is already possessed; or if we be unable to explain these objections, they have no force against the direct proofs Scripture gives of the truth, save to prove our own incapacity to solve them.<a name=177:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus it is insisted on, in the pamphlet before us, pages 13, 14, that we wait with the world for the appearing of Christ.<a name=177:3></a>" In 1 Thessalonians 5: 1-4, after speaking of the day of the Lord coming on the world as a thief in the night, the apostle adds, 'But ye, brethren, are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief.<a name=177:4></a>' The natural inference being, that the day of the Lord will come simultaneously upon the world and the church; only it will find the latter prepared for it, while it will be destruction to the former.<a name=177:5></a>" Now, take the plain expression of one passage which sums up the declarations of many, "when Christ who is our life shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.<a name=177:6></a>" It at once shews that, whatever may be the divine reasons for referring us to the Lord's appearing, as a time of blessing, or in connection with our responsibility (and Scripture does both), it is perfectly certain that it is not meant that we shall not be with Christ before He appears, nor that we shall be personally on earth as others are, so that He will appear to us and the earth at the same time.<a name=177:7></a> This we know to be false doctrine; because the word tells us that we shall then appear, or be manifested, along with Him.<a name=177:8></a>

		But we learn more as to the teaching of those who would persuade us of it.<a name=178:1></a> The aim of that teaching, its direct and necessary tendency, is to destroy our distinctive relationship with Christ, and to connect us with the world, reducing us to the lowest possible level of hope which can be true for one who is not actually lost.<a name=178:2></a> Our proper heavenly connection with Christ is lost.<a name=178:3></a> This aim is accompanied by so obvious a loss of all spiritual intelligence, such an obliteration of the positive teaching of Christ and the Holy Ghost, that it becomes at once evident, to those not under its influence, what its source is.<a name=178:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nor can anything be more groundless than the special objections.<a name=178:5></a> The first is a very favourite one of this school "It [i.<a name=178:6></a>e.<a name=178:7></a>, the view combated] takes away from us our direct and full interest in considerable portions of the gospels, and almost the whole of the Apocalypse; for these are regarded as strictly and properly belonging only to certain parties, Jews and Gentiles, which will come under the divine dealings after the removal of the church," etc.<a name=178:8></a> (pages 5, 6).<a name=178:9></a> To talk, then, of robbing us of much in the gospels and the Apocalypse is, we repeat, the more absurd, since the special privilege of the heavenly saints is to know what does not concern them.<a name=178:10></a> In virtue of this, they are "friends," not because of having external signs given.<a name=178:11></a> To encourage the weak faith of the tried Jewish remnant they were really given, as will appear more clearly when we come to examine Matthew 24, and kindred Scriptures.<a name=178:12></a> But it is a hollow and false principle that the gift of a revelation to any one implies that he will be in the circumstances described: least of all is it true of the church, to which all Scripture is given.<a name=178:13></a> But thence to argue that we must be there, that this or that prediction is about us, is as unreasonable as contrary to fact.<a name=178:14></a> Yet ought the church to have an understanding of all, for "we have the mind of Christ.<a name=178:15></a>" The Lord's grace communicates to us what concerns others, and sometimes that we may intercede for others.<a name=178:16></a> Thus it was with Abraham: the Lord revealed to him what did not concern himself.<a name=178:17></a> Did Abraham lose by the Lord's communicating to him what concerned Lot?<a name=178:18></a> or would he have gained by imagining that it was about himself?<a name=178:19></a> Was Enoch worse off than Noah because the one declared what was coming on the world, not on himself, and was translated before there was a sign of the judgment, while the other received a warning of what concerned the circumstances he was in, so that, moved with fear, he gave

		heed and was saved through the deluge of waters?<a name=179:1></a> So with the church in the Revelation.<a name=179:2></a> None can deny that there is absolute silence as to the church (we do not say saints) on earth when the terrible judgments, symbolised by seals, trumpets, and vials, issue from the throne.<a name=179:3></a> Churches are spoken of before Revelation 4, and they are addressed after the visions close in Revelation 22.<a name=179:4></a> For no doubt the church ought to be the vessel of divine testimony as to what is coming, as Enoch was, and ought to be in the place of intercession, as was Abraham; but the church is outside the scene of judgment in the Revelation, as both these types were in Genesis.<a name=179:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the second objection surrenders, in fact, the principles of which the first complains so loudly; for it is owned, though it seems reluctantly, that there are passages in the gospels (and so much the more in the Revelation) where the apostles are not our representatives.<a name=179:6></a> Thus, while we are privileged to profit by Matthew 10, it is plain that the commission there given is, in important respects, the reverse of our service as Christians now.<a name=179:7></a> It is only through the Holy Ghost enabling us to compare aright scripture with scripture, that we can discern what concerns a Jewish remnant of old or by and by, and that which describes or supposes our position.<a name=179:8></a> The author asks somewhat triumphantly in page 7, "Do they represent us, and listen for us, at the sermon on the Mount, at the last supper, at the concluding discourse in John; and yet represent another set of people in Matthew 24, and Luke 21?<a name=179:9></a> Are we on church ground with Martha and Mary at Bethany; and in company with the Jewish remnant when we place ourselves with the disciples on the Mount of Olives?<a name=179:10></a> (Matthew 24: 3).<a name=179:11></a>" Now, so far are the distinctions in question of an arbitrary nature that the argument used to expose them demonstrates their reality.<a name=179:12></a> For imbedded in the sermon on the Mount are words of our Lord which apply far more closely to Jews or the remnant than to the church.<a name=179:13></a> (See Matthew 5: 25; 6: 12, 13, 33, etc.<a name=179:14></a>).<a name=179:15></a> And as to the prophetic discourses in Matthew 24 and 25, it carries on its front and within its own compass, the clearest evidence of these distinctions.<a name=179:16></a> For in the early part the Lord speaks of the temple and its destruction, of the abomination of desolation, with express reference to a prophecy which professedly relates to the Jews and the remnant up to the last days.<a name=179:17></a> But this is not all.<a name=179:18></a> What has this character and is connected with Jerusalem, Judea, and that nation, is

	<div class="paragraph">
		plainly distinguished from the parables which relate to Christians during the absence of the Lord (viz.<a name=180:1></a>, the household servant, the virgins, and the talents).<a name=180:2></a> These last are not Jewish, but in some respects in marked contrast with what precedes, as well as with the closing sketch in Matthew 25 which gives the Lord's dealings with the Gentiles on His return as King.<a name=180:3></a> To deny these distinctions, then, is ignorance, and nothing better.<a name=180:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nobody affirms that the church existed as a fact at the last supper in Jerusalem, or when the Lord uttered His discourses, etc.<a name=180:5></a>, in John 13-17, or at Bethany; but it is abundantly clear that these scenes contemplated much which was afterwards verified in the church, and outside the remnant, while the remnant had special provision for it made in Luke 21.<a name=180:6></a> Nothing simpler than what the writer seeks to mystify.<a name=180:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, in this late defence of the system which denies the distinct portion of the church and its rapture previous to the Lord's appearing, the time of vengeance in which even the Jewish remnant is desired to flee -- the time of visiting the unbelief of the nation with anguish and trouble unheard of; in a word, the most awful chastisement for unfaithfulness the world ever saw -- is confounded with the privilege of suffering for Christ by faith!<a name=180:8></a> "A further objection to it is the extraordinary result, that the church will be removed from the earth at the very time of all others when we should think its testimony would be most needed, and when suffering will be most glorious [!<a name=180:9></a>!<a name=180:10></a>].<a name=180:11></a> Surely, of all others, the church of Christ is best fitted to be confronted with the great Antichrist and his followers.<a name=180:12></a> Strange, indeed, should its martyrology break off at that critical period!<a name=180:13></a> Strange if tribulations, closely linked in the apocalyptic visions with the brightest glories of heaven, should be reserved for another than that body, which for nearly two thousand years has been associated in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ!<a name=180:14></a>" (Attempt, page 7.<a name=180:15></a>) Can ignorance of God's ways be shewn more painfully than this confusion of suffering with Christ, and suffering fearful penalty for having slighted Him and His will?<a name=180:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The last of these general presumptions is that Scripture intimates delays and impediments to the coming of Christ (pages 7, 8); and it is argued, that if to know what shall befall others be a privilege, still more what personally affects ourselves.<a name=180:17></a> Can anything exceed the blindness here manifested as
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=181>[Page 181]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		to what spiritual privilege is?<a name=181:1></a> Is knowing what applies to ourselves the proof that we are friends of God?<a name=181:2></a> After Abraham had promises relative to himself and his seed, the Lord says, "Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do?<a name=181:3></a>" And what did He make known to him?<a name=181:4></a> What concerned himself?<a name=181:5></a> No; but what concerned Lot, of which there was no need.<a name=181:6></a> Lot heard in due time what concerned himself.<a name=181:7></a> So, says the Lord, in a scripture which the writer cites in the same paragraph, "I have called you friends, for whatsoever I have heard of my Father, I have made known unto you.<a name=181:8></a>" I tell a man what concerns himself as a matter of business or duty; I tell my friend what my heart is interested in, whether it concerns him or not, because he is my friend.<a name=181:9></a> (Compare Ephesians 1: 8-10.<a name=181:10></a>) How entirely this system destroys spirituality and divine intelligence!<a name=181:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And here we would say a word on the practical effect as indicative of the real character of these views.<a name=181:12></a> We are told that it is impossible rightly to be expecting the Lord from day to day; and this because all the predicted signs must first come to pass.<a name=181:13></a> Now, we ask any serious Christian, if this be not in direct contradiction of all the teachings and warnings of Scripture (those passages excepted whose proper application is in debate)?<a name=181:14></a> Does the Lord direct us to be habitually waiting and watching always for Him?<a name=181:15></a> Be it Christian or Jewish remnant that it refers to, does He not insist earnestly upon it?<a name=181:16></a> and that in such an hour as those He addresses think not, the Son of man cometh?<a name=181:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Further, the whole order of God's dealings is subverted.<a name=181:18></a> "We do believe the church and the remnant to be on earth together," etc.<a name=181:19></a> (page 39).<a name=181:20></a> That is, they believe that the full explicit revelation of the church, wherein is neither Jew nor Gentile but all one, and a recognition, on the part of God, of a body of persons as to whom He sanctions hopes exactly contrary to this (furnishing inspired terms for the expression and encouragement of them), will go on together on the earth.<a name=181:21></a> As an analogy to this, the state of the disciples during Jesus' life, and the condition of the church afterwards, and the case of the disciples of John (Acts 19), are brought forward.<a name=181:22></a> That is, the progress of the same saints out of Jewish thoughts into a church standing by the coming of the Holy Ghost, in the former case, and the instant cessation of the Jewish state of hope because of the Christian revelation, when it came to

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another sample of the extreme levity and carelessness of the writer is this: "To say that while we are here, it [the Apocalypse] is of use to us, is to plead for a very secondary concern in it" (page 6).<a name=182:3></a> The view of the writer is that its warnings are to be of use to the church when it is in the circumstances referred to.<a name=182:4></a> Is it not evident, then, according to the author's theory, that this destroys its usefulness as to at least eighteen hundred years and more of the church's history?<a name=182:5></a> The necessity of being in the time of its fulfilment to make it useful, destroys its constant use for the church; whereas the knowledge of its application to a body traversing the time of trial, after the church's rapture, makes its usefulness apply to all, though its accomplishment is for others.<a name=182:6></a> If men must be in the circumstances to render it useful, the Apocalypse has had, on the author's shewing, no utility yet.<a name=182:7></a> 2 Peter 1: 19, which he quotes, is strongly against his arguments, besides being altogether misinterpreted.<a name=182:8></a> The point here is the excellence of the prophetic word as a lamp, till a light still better dawns on the heart.<a name=182:9></a> The apostle does not mean till the day of the Lord actually come upon the world, but till the heart is imbued with daylight, and the morning star arise therein (i.<a name=182:10></a>e.<a name=182:11></a>, till the saint is awakened to the heavenly hope, apart from the events of prophecy).<a name=182:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The parable of the tares of the field (Matthew 13) is the first of the special scriptures adduced as positively adverse.<a name=182:13></a> "'Both grow together until the harvest' (verse 30); a statement clearly decisive of the whole question, for unbroken certainty cannot possibly be more plainly expressed" (page 9) .<a name=182:14></a>.<a name=182:15></a>.<a name=182:16></a> "and at one definite point of time, the harvest, or the end of the age" (page 10).<a name=182:17></a> The short answer is, that the harvest is <i>not</i> one definite point of time.<a name=182:18></a> "In the time of harvest," it is written, "I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.<a name=182:19></a>" First do this, and then that.<a name=182:20></a> In other words, it is a period in which different events take place, the order and meaning of which is exactly what is in question.<a name=182:21></a> It is also alleged (page 9), that "gathered together" is the same as "rooted up.<a name=182:22></a>" But it is no such thing: quite a different word
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=183>[Page 183]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		is used for rooted up.<a name=183:1></a> Again, "gathering together," or up, is said to be removal from the field by reaping or plucking up, that is, the end of present existence -- a very singular explanation.<a name=183:2></a> We all know such is not the effect of reaping.<a name=183:3></a> The removal of the wheat from the field is expressed in quite a different way.<a name=183:4></a> Indeed the tares are never said to be removed from the field at all, and notoriously, if we turn to the thing prefigured, they will be judged in the field when the harvest comes, and to this the parable looks on.<a name=183:5></a> In truth, the subject is the field, as to which there is one only exception -- "Gather the wheat into my garner.<a name=183:6></a>" The thorns, we read elsewhere, will be utterly burned in the fire in the same place.<a name=183:7></a> The tares are gathered together to be burned -- clearly declaring that the gathering together is not the final judgment.<a name=183:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Further, none can read the parable and its explanation without seeing that they describe different scenes, as is always the case in such prophetic statements, because public results before men explain what is parabolically stated when the results are not there.<a name=183:9></a> Thus, gathering the wheat into the garner is not shining forth as the sun, nor is gathering into bundles to be burnt the same as gathering out of the kingdom and casting them into the fire.<a name=183:10></a> Note here, that the uniform testimony of Scripture is that the saints will appear, or be manifested, when Christ appears for judgment.<a name=183:11></a> (Colossians 3; Revelation 17: 14; chapter 19.<a name=183:12></a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence the gathering the wheat into the garner must be before the gathering evils out of His kingdom and casting them into the furnace of fire.<a name=183:13></a> The making the heavenly saints to remain on earth while the judgment is being executed, is against the universal statement of all scripture.<a name=183:14></a> And this is what is alleged.<a name=183:15></a> For if the gathering the tares in bundles to be burned be the same as their final burning (an allegation indeed manifestly absurd), then their complete judgment takes place before the saints are taken into the garner; "the end of present existence" as regards the tares is before the saints are with Christ.<a name=183:16></a> Further, the righteous shining forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father is clearly not in the present age, which the harvest of judgment closes.<a name=183:17></a> It is the new age, while the gathering into the garner is part of the harvest or end of this age.<a name=183:18></a> The harvest, then, or end of the age, is certainly not one point of time.<a name=183:19></a> The Lord Himself states a "first" in what happens.<a name=183:20></a> The only question then is, Does the rapture of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One point of the old system is avoided.<a name=184:5></a> It used to be maintained that when Christ rose up from the Father's throne the present age closed.<a name=184:6></a> But the parable of the tares described the end of this age.<a name=184:7></a> Hence the judgment of the earth was before Christ came at all, and the catching up of the saints too.<a name=184:8></a> The absurdity of this was evident, and it is now avoided; but the elements of the error remain -- only concealed.<a name=184:9></a> The harvest is made one definite point of time as the end of the age.<a name=184:10></a> If it be not Christ's rising up, it must be the moment of His executing judgment which closes it.<a name=184:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Where are the heavenly saints then according to Scripture?<a name=184:12></a> The wicked are punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord.<a name=184:13></a> When this judgment is executed, are the saints still unchanged on the earth or already caught up?<a name=184:14></a> If still unchanged on the earth, and the resurrection yet to come, then is there a negative to all these statements together: "The Lord shall come with ten thousand of his saints"; "The Lord thy God shall come and all his saints with thee"; "They that are with him are called and chosen and faithful"; "The armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean"; "When Christ, our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.<a name=184:15></a>" But Scripture declares these things positively.<a name=184:16></a> That is, the saints must have already been caught up to meet Him.<a name=184:17></a> But if so, the whole proffered explanation of the parable of the tares is false, and hangs on the blunder of interpreting the gathering of the tares together in bundles to be burned as meaning their actual burning, accompanied by the contradictory allegation that the harvest is one definite point of time.<a name=184:18></a> That anyone should not see clear on such points is evidently to be borne with.<a name=184:19></a> We are all ignorant on many points.<a name=184:20></a>

		As to what is insinuated on Daniel 7, and the endeavour to connect the Son of man with the kingdom after the blasphemies of the little horn, the way of putting the matter is incorrect, and, to say the least, the one-sided result of prejudice.<a name=185:12></a> For the account of the reception of the kingdom is not merely after the horn's blasphemies, but after the beast's judgment and destruction for those blasphemies.<a name=185:13></a> So that if it were just to apply the passage to the remaining of the church on earth during the whole career of Antichrist, the passage would equally prove that the church was on earth after the destruction of the beast.<a name=185:14></a> That is, the whole argument and application of the text is entirely groundless; for the heavenly saints come with Christ to judgment.<a name=185:15></a> The prophecy speaks of the earthly kingdom, first of the beasts, and then of the Son of man.<a name=185:16></a> The place or portion of the church is not touched on at all in the statement.<a name=185:17></a> It is the kingdom under the whole heaven; while the following explanation of the prophecy (as all Scripture), declares that judgment is given to the saints of the Most High.<a name=185:18></a> It is but an additional proof how the whole tenor and bearing of Scripture is lost by such as maintain this system.<a name=185:19></a> If we enter into details, we shall find that the thrones were set before the judgment begins, and indeed in order to it.<a name=185:20></a>

		In chapter 13 we get the earthly agent of Satan, the Roman Empire; but not as a direct subject in its heathen character, but in its blasphemous one; still it is viewed as being the last of the four empires that came out of the sea, but with ten horns and seven heads, and embracing characteristically the other three.<a name=202:4></a> The slain head had been slain, and continued "as if slain," but had been healed.<a name=202:5></a> This is part of his character, shewing previous existence and history of a beast who now rises, to whom the dragon gives his authority.<a name=202:6></a> But the world would be infidel in it, and take up, independent of Christianity, the admiration of that power which would have destroyed Christ in its imperial character.<a name=202:7></a> Blasphemy is the new character of the beast, and he continues in this character forty-two months -- half a week, not a whole one.<a name=202:8></a> He blasphemes God, and in the shape of His name, dwelling-place, and the dwellers in heaven.<a name=202:9></a> This is characteristic.<a name=202:10></a> The church, as a heavenly thing, could not be endured.<a name=202:11></a> But it intimates that in the close, historically, the church is already caught up.<a name=202:12></a> He can only blaspheme them.<a name=202:13></a> But he makes war with the saints on earth (i.<a name=202:14></a>e.<a name=202:15></a>, who are not dwellers in heaven).<a name=202:16></a> The dwellers on earth worship him, save the elect remnant.<a name=202:17></a> I apprehend this latter is more universal in character; while the saints he overcomes are active in witness, more or less, and answer to the saints of the high places (Daniel 7) whom he wears out.<a name=202:18></a> Though more generally expressed here, they are the understanding ones of Daniel 11; not the church, but not merely faithful, but aware of God's title and ways, as the Most High, and their testimony obnoxious to the beast.<a name=202:19></a> Hence they are slain and go up -- though they do not dwell there.<a name=202:20></a> The changing times and laws is the Jewish part, and not brought in here; but the period is the same.<a name=202:21></a> And the two former parts of Daniel 7: 25 are found here (read "written from the foundation of the world").<a name=202:22></a> As yet, God not being come in in judgment, submission, not actual resistance, is the patient path of faith.<a name=202:23></a> He will bring judgment on the persecutor.<a name=202:24></a> The rest of the chapter and chapter 14 do not offer, I think, much difficulty.<a name=202:25></a> We have active satanic agency, bearing the form of Messiah's power, and ministering to the first beast's throne and blasphemous claims.<a name=202:26></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		What I would desire to bring before you is, the coming of the Lord as the proper hope of the church, and to shew you that it is constantly, increasingly brought before it as such by the Spirit of God.<a name=206:1></a> When once the foundation is laid of His first coming as that which brings personally peace and salvation (and even before it, so far as it is a means of awakening the conscience), the one thing the saints were taught to look for was the coming of the Lord.<a name=206:2></a> No doubt the first thing the soul needs to know is the ground of its salvation.<a name=206:3></a> When this is known, the Lord Himself becomes precious to the believer; and when the church was in a healthy state, we shall find that the hearts of the saints were altogether set upon Him, and looking for His coming.<a name=206:4></a> And now our hearts should understand (as I shall shew you from Scripture was the case then) that the coming of Christ is not some strange speculation, or the advanced idea of a few, but was set before the church as elementary and foundation truth, and formed a part of all their habits and feelings, and mingled itself with every thought.<a name=206:5></a> It was and is the keystone of all that keeps up the heart in this solitary place (looking at it as journeying through the wilderness).<a name=206:6></a> Thus with a heart full of love for God, and the desire to see Christ, we can appreciate the apostle's prayer for us -- "The Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting<a href="#206:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> for Christ.<a name=206:7></a>" We have not long to wait; and it is worth being patient for.<a name=206:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We shall find, too, that the teaching of Scripture as to Christ's second coming casts wonderful light on the value of His first coming.<a name=206:9></a> For His second coming, as it concerns the saints, is to complete as regards their bodies (so bringing them into the full result of salvation) that work of life-giving power Christ has already wrought in their souls, founded on the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we receive the statements of Scripture, all is as simple as possible: that the first coming of Christ to do His Father's will was so complete in its efficacy that they who belong to that first coming, who have part in its efficacy by faith, are forgiven, cleansed, justified, by its virtue; and that when He comes the second time, He comes to bring them to glory.<a name=207:13></a> The moment I get hold of the truth that the coming is, for believers, to receive them to Himself, the moment I see that His coming the second time is to bring in the glory -- to change us into His own likeness and to have us with Him, it affects everything, instead of being an unimportant thing.<a name=207:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe death is the most blessed thing that can happen to a Christian; but it is not the thing I am looking for.<a name=207:15></a> I am looking to see Him.<a name=207:16></a> He might come to-morrow, or tonight, or now.<a name=207:17></a> Do you not think it would spoil all your plans?<a name=207:18></a> Suppose you thought He might come, would it not make a difference in your thoughts?<a name=207:19></a> You know it would.<a name=207:20></a> Suppose a wife expects her husband to return from a journey, do you not think there would be an effort to have everything ready?<a name=207:21></a>

		Another thing I have found to be specially blessed is, that it connects me with Christ so nearly that I do not think merely of going to heaven and being happy -- a vague thought this.<a name=207:22></a>

		Of course, I shall be perfectly happy: surely we shall.<a name=208:1></a> The divine presence will shed sure and endless blessing around.<a name=208:2></a> But one is coming whom I know, who loves me, who has given Himself for me, whom I have learned to love: and I shall be with Him for ever.<a name=208:3></a> Christ becomes personally more in view, more the object of our thoughts.<a name=208:4></a> Nothing is so powerful as Scripture for everything.<a name=208:5></a> It deals with the soul in the power of divine light.<a name=208:6></a> It reveals Christ, bringing the heart's judgment into His presence.<a name=208:7></a> It convicts every thought of the heart, shewing what it is in truth.<a name=208:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are three ways in which Christ is pointed to in Scripture: on the cross at His first coming; He is sitting on the right hand of God; and He is coming again.<a name=208:9></a> In the first, He has laid the foundation of that which I have in Him: the foundation was on the cross.<a name=208:10></a> And now that He is sitting on the right hand of God, He has sent us the Holy Ghost the Comforter while awaiting His return, giving to those in whom He dwells the full certainty of faith as to the efficacy of His work and their own redemption.<a name=208:11></a> God's love and their own adoption thus lead them to desire with ardent hope His coming again.<a name=208:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having thus given a general idea of the place Christ's coming holds in Scripture, I will take a few passages in different parts of the word, without going fully into them now, to shew that it is the great truth of Scripture hope, and that all the thoughts, feelings, hopes, interests of God's children are connected with it -- that not only it is not a false idea, but that it is not rare or strange, but enters into the whole structure of Christian feeling.<a name=208:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus 1 Thessalonians 1: 9, 10, "For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God; and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.<a name=208:14></a>" Here we find that the world was talking about this expectation of the Christians: so sure was their expectation and so strong the influence which it exercised on their conduct.<a name=208:15></a> They (the disciples) were looking for God's Son from heaven; it formed a part of that to which the heathen were converted -- to the present waiting for God's Son from heaven -- so that the world took notice of it.<a name=208:16></a> In chapter 2: 18, 19, "For what is our hope, our joy, or crown of rejoicing?<a name=208:17></a>" Most beautiful

		here to see the affection of Paul for the saints; but to what did his heart look as the time when these affections would be satisfied in their blessing?<a name=209:1></a> The coming of Christ.<a name=209:2></a> Again, as regards holiness, we see exactly the same thing in chapter 3: 12, 13, "And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you: to the end he may stablish your hearts unblamable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.<a name=209:3></a>" The coming of Christ (and His coming with all the saints, so that it can confer but one thing) was so near to his spirit that he looks at their being found perfect then as the object his heart desired.<a name=209:4></a> And in chapter 4: 13-18, "But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.<a name=209:5></a> For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.<a name=209:6></a> For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord, shall not prevent them which are asleep.<a name=209:7></a> For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first.<a name=209:8></a> Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.<a name=209:9></a> Wherefore comfort one another with these words.<a name=209:10></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We find that, instead of the Lord's coming being a strange doctrine, while he could not look for the Christian's dying without his going to heaven, yet the comfort he gives is not that, but their return with Jesus.<a name=209:11></a> Death did not deprive them of this; God would have them with Him.<a name=209:12></a> First note, beloved friends, the full assurance expressed here for living and dead saints alike.<a name=209:13></a> How do people persist in saying it is impossible to tell on this side the grave?<a name=209:14></a> The apostle does tell for both.<a name=209:15></a> The first coming of Christ has so finished redemption and the putting away of sin, that His second is glory and being with Him, for the dead and living saints.<a name=209:16></a> But see how present the coming of the Lord was to their minds.<a name=209:17></a> If I were to comfort the friends of a departed saint by saying that God would bring him with Jesus when He came again, what would they think of me?<a name=209:18></a> That I was mad or wild.<a name=209:19></a> Yet such is the comfort Paul gives to the Thessalonians, and no other, though he plainly

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But these examples shew how the coming of the Lord mixed itself with every thought and feeling of Christianity then.<a name=210:2></a> So in his wish for Christians in chapter 5: 23, "The very God of peace sanctify you wholly, and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=210:3></a>" But the world rejects this news, and the church becomes worldly -- has lost her value for it.<a name=210:4></a> Not so the first disciples: their hearts were attached to their Master; and they desired to see Him to be like Him.<a name=210:5></a> They waited as a present condition of soul for God's Son from heaven.<a name=210:6></a> I have gone through these passages, not merely to prove the doctrine, but to shew the way in which it connected itself with the whole of the Christian's life.<a name=210:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We will turn back now to see the universal testimony of Scripture to the truth of this doctrine and the various aspects it takes; and first Matthew 24: 30, 31, "And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet; and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.<a name=210:8></a>" When the disciples ask Him the time when these things are to be, He tells them to watch; and in verse 44, "Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.<a name=210:9></a>" But the Lord goes farther in the following parables, which apply to Christians.<a name=210:10></a> The mark of the evil servant given there is that he says in his heart "my lord delayeth his coming," and thereupon begins to eat and drink with the drunken.<a name=210:11></a> They lost the expectation of Christ and sank down into hierarchical power and into the world, into comfort and pleasure.<a name=210:12></a> But the Bridegroom did tarry, and the church lost the present expectation of Christ and the blessed fruit of it on their souls.<a name=210:13></a> Matthew 25: 1, "Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps and went forth to meet the Bridegroom.<a name=210:14></a>" There is the essence of the church's calling.<a name=210:15></a> They went forth, but while the Bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept -- saints as well as professors, no exception They all lost the sense of what they had gone out to, and gave up watching.<a name=210:16></a> And what is it that aroused them from the sleepy

	<div class="paragraph">
		state into which they had fallen?<a name=211:1></a> "And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the Bridegroom cometh: go ye out to meet him" (verse 6).<a name=211:2></a> They had to be called out again; they had got into the world, into some place to sleep more comfortably (just where the professing church is now), eating and drinking with the drunken, and the cry is, I trust, again going forth, "Behold, the Bridegroom cometh.<a name=211:3></a>" And what made the church depart from the sense of what they had been called out to was, saying (just what people, and Christian people too, are saying now) "The Lord delayeth his coming.<a name=211:4></a>" They do not say He will not come, but He delays it; we are not to expect Him.<a name=211:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will pass over Mark, not that there are not plenty of passages there, but that what we find there is substantially the same as what we find in Matthew.<a name=211:6></a> I will go on therefore to Luke 12: 35-38, "Let your loins be girded about, and your lamps burning; and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately.<a name=211:7></a> Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching; verily, I say unto you, that he shall gird himself and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them.<a name=211:8></a> And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants.<a name=211:9></a>" Remark here that the waiting for the coming of Christ is what characterises the Christian according to the mind of Christ.<a name=211:10></a> Men speak of death, but death is not "my lord.<a name=211:11></a>"

		LECTURE 2 -- EPHESIANS 1
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		At the last lecture I mentioned that the two epistles in which the second coming of the Lord is not spoken of are the Galatians and the Ephesians.<a name=217:2></a> It may seem strange that, this being the case, I should have selected on this occasion the chapter we have just read.<a name=217:3></a> But I have done so (and shall refer to other passages with the same intention, desiring to found all I say upon Scripture) because that chapter gives us a general view of the whole scene and plan that will be fully accomplished at the second coming of our Lord.<a name=217:4></a> It does not speak of the fact of Christ's coming, but it does tell of the purpose which God has, and that will then be accomplished.<a name=217:5></a> And not only that, but it shews us the way in which the church of God (I mean all true saints gathered to Christ by the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven) at the coming of Christ have a portion or part in it -- what their place in this great plan of God is, that plan having necessarily for its centre the exaltation of the Son, "the brightness of God's glory.<a name=217:6></a>" He was humbled to be exalted.<a name=217:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The way in which God has dealt with us, beloved friends, is this -- He has brought us completely to Himself, having respect to the whole value of Christ's work; and, in doing that, He has given us a place with Christ.<a name=217:8></a> He makes us like Christ; and, having thus made us near to Himself, He then unfolds to us all His plans.<a name=217:9></a> It is not merely being made safe, but, being brought as children to God: "all things are yours, and ye are Christ's, and Christ is God's.<a name=217:10></a>" But then, having done this, He treats you -- as His expression is to Abraham, and as Christ's expression is to His disciples -- as friends.<a name=217:11></a> The Lord says, "Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do?<a name=217:12></a>" And what He then told Him was not merely that he personally was in His favour -- that He told him long before.<a name=217:13></a> He does not merely shew him the promises which belonged to him and his seed: but He told him too what concerned the world, and did not

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If I am dealing with a man with whom I am on good terms, but not on terms of friendship, I tell him whatever is needed with regard to the business between us, according to the common courtesies of life; and there it ends.<a name=218:3></a> But if I have a friend, I tell him what is in my heart.<a name=218:4></a> This is what God does with His children -- as Christ said to His disciples, "Henceforth I call you not servants, for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.<a name=218:5></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And there is not a greater proof of the extent to which the church has lost its conscious identity with Christ, than its giving up its expectation of the coming of Christ.<a name=218:6></a> And why is that, but because there are so many whose hearts do not enter into this thought, that God has brought them so near to Himself that they are considered as having been taken into His family?<a name=218:7></a> "Sons and daughters," the expression is, and sons and daughters too of full age.<a name=218:8></a> That was not their position under the law.<a name=218:9></a> Therefore it is said that "the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant though he be lord of all.<a name=218:10></a> But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.<a name=218:11></a> And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba Father.<a name=218:12></a>" And, because you have the Spirit, because you have an unction from the Holy One, you know all things, having the consciousness of being sons of God, sons of full age, so as to possess the confidence of the Father.<a name=218:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And the same Spirit, who is the Spirit of adoption, unfolds to us all the things which are freely given to us of God.<a name=218:14></a> "It is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.<a name=218:15></a>" And there people generally stop; whereas the apostle goes on to say, in order to shew the difference between that and our state, "But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit; for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God .<a name=218:16></a>.<a name=218:17></a>.<a name=218:18></a> .<a name=218:19></a> Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God; that we might know the things which are freely given to us of God," 1 Corinthians 2: 9-12.<a name=218:20></a> Now is it not a strange things that people

		Such is the order of his prayer withal: our calling, our nearness to God; our inheritance, that is, everything of which we are heirs along with Christ; and, then, there is the power which brings us into it.<a name=220:13></a> That is, the very same power which raised Christ from the dead has raised every believer out of his state of death in sin to the same place with Christ.<a name=220:14></a> And, having brought them into one, at the end he shews us the place to which Christ is raised -- "at his own right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come; and hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.<a name=220:15></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		This enables us to see a little of the way in which God accomplishes His plan; and it was to shew what that plan is that I read this chapter -- "That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in

		Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth" -- under Christ as the Head.<a name=221:1></a> But when Christ takes this place as man (of course as God He is over all always; but when He takes this place as man), we take the inheritance along with Him.<a name=221:2></a> We are joint-heirs -- "in whom also we have obtained an inheritance.<a name=221:3></a>" And, again in Romans, "if children, then heirs, heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ.<a name=221:4></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the principle of that is what many Christians are sadly unmindful of, having lost the consciousness of the way in which they have been brought by God into the same place as Christ, who became a man on purpose to bring us into the same place with Himself.<a name=221:5></a> "The glory which thou gavest me I have given them.<a name=221:6></a>" If He is a Son, so are we.<a name=221:7></a> He is our life, our righteousness; and we share His glory, the fruit of righteousness.<a name=221:8></a> When He was transfigured, Moses and Elias appeared in the same glory, talking familiarly with Him.<a name=221:9></a> And we should consider that the Lord has come down in lowliness and humiliation amongst us, that our hearts might get near enough to Him to understand that.<a name=221:10></a>

		Having got the plan then, we shall now go through some passages of scripture to shew how the Lord brings it about.<a name=221:11></a> If you will turn to Psalm 2, you will see the way in which the Lord was first presented on earth to have the earthly dominion, and was rejected:<a href="#221:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> we shall see immediately how the two things are connected.<a name=221:12></a> "Why do the heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing?<a name=221:13></a> The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against his anointed.<a name=221:14></a>" This is quoted by Peter with reference to Herod and Pilate, etc.<a name=221:15></a> "He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh; the Lord shall have them in derision.<a name=221:16></a>" That is, Christ Himself shall have them in derision.<a name=221:17></a> "Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.<a name=221:18></a>" This is not come yet.<a name=221:19></a> "Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion" -- in spite of all this rejection -- "I will declare the decree: the Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.<a name=221:20></a> Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.<a name=221:21></a> Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.<a name=221:22></a>"

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And now, as confirmatory of what I have just said, let me ask you to turn to the book of Revelation, at the end of chapter 2 to shew the way in which we are connected with Christ.<a name=222:2></a> "He that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers; even as I received of my Father.<a name=222:3></a>" I refer to this now for the purpose of shewing that even in such things the saints are connected with Christ, although these, of course, are not the most blessed things in which they are connected with Him.<a name=222:4></a> It is said immediately afterwards, "and I will give him the morning star" -- Christ Himself; and this is infinitely more precious.<a name=222:5></a> But still He associates them with Himself in all His glory.<a name=222:6></a> He receives these heathen for His inheritance and breaks them in pieces; and so shall you with Him if you are faithful.<a name=222:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is strange to see how the church of God has lost the sense of all things; and I refer to these passages to shew how the saints are associated with Christ, even with reference to those extreme cases.<a name=222:8></a> "Do ye not know," says Paul to the Corinthians, "that the saints shall judge the world?<a name=222:9></a>" He tells them just to think of that, and then to consider whether they were not worthy "to judge the smallest matter" (speaking of saints going to law with one another).<a name=222:10></a> Are you not able, any of you, to settle the commonest things between yourselves?<a name=222:11></a> "Know ye not that we shall judge angels?<a name=222:12></a>" It was necessary to tell them this, because they had not got hold of a right understanding of the place in which Christ has put the saints, because they did not see their association with Christ in all the fulness of its meaning.<a name=222:13></a> I have referred to this association with Christ in judgment, not at all because it is the most blessed part of it, but as confirmatory of what I have said about the association of the saints with Christ.<a name=222:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Observe that Psalm 2 speaks of Christ's coming and being rejected.<a name=222:15></a> Peter quotes it in that view, and Paul also the words, "Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.<a name=222:16></a>" And, being rejected, the Lord (that is, Christ) is there represented as laughing -- which is, of course, a figure -- at all the raging of the nations; and it is said that the time will come when He will sit in Zion in spite of them all, and have all the world given Him for His inheritance.<a name=222:17></a> This, however, does not

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		At His first coming, He was rejected as Christ, the Messiah the Anointed.<a name=223:3></a> And mark what light this throws even upon the gospel.<a name=223:4></a> We find Christ charging His disciples strictly that they should no more say He was the Christ, because He was to be rejected, for "the Son of man," He says, "shall suffer many things.<a name=223:5></a>" It was, as if He had said, "I am not now to take my place as King of Zion.<a name=223:6></a> I come in another way.<a name=223:7></a> I come to be the suffering Son of man, in order that I may afterwards take a far higher place of glory.<a name=223:8></a>" You find accordingly, in Luke and the other gospels, that He strictly charges His disciples not to say that He was the Christ, because that was really over in consequence of His being rejected.<a name=223:9></a> Now take Psalm 8 -- "O Jehovah, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!<a name=223:10></a> who hast set thy glory above the heavens.<a name=223:11></a> Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.<a name=223:12></a>" This, you know, was fulfilled when He rode upon the ass's colt into Jerusalem.<a name=223:13></a> "What is man, that thou art mindful of him?<a name=223:14></a> and the Son of man that thou visitest him?<a name=223:15></a> For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour.<a name=223:16></a> Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands: thou hast put all things under his feet.<a name=223:17></a>" It is there intimated that, though as Christ He was rejected, the consequence of His being rejected was that He takes His place as Son of man, in which He was to have everything put under His feet.<a name=223:18></a> You will see how the apostle reasons on that in the New Testament.<a name=223:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These two Psalms shew His coming among the Jews and being rejected, and yet His taking His place over these rebels in spite of them at the end.<a name=223:20></a> But the present consequence of His rejection is that He takes the place (which He always gives Himself in the gospels) of being the Son of man.<a name=223:21></a> Coming to the New Testament, I have just read from the Ephesians, "He hath put all things under his feet," and, being in that place, "gave him to be head over all things to the church, which is his body.<a name=223:22></a>" The church is His body, making the complete man, and is therefore said to be "the fulness of him that filleth all in all.<a name=223:23></a>" Christ is a divine Person, though a

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The church, therefore, is as closely associated with Him as a man's own flesh is with himself.<a name=224:2></a> This is the comparison employed in Ephesians 5, "No man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church; for we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.<a name=224:3></a>" And in this body there being but one Spirit, the church is associated with Christ as taking the headship over everything.<a name=224:4></a> We see Christ, the Son of man, in the counsels of God set over everything in heaven and on earth; and we, as being close to Him, His redeemed ones, His brethren, joint-heirs, and members of His body, are completely identified with Him in His place of headship.<a name=224:5></a> You thus see the connection of the church with Christ's glory at His second coming.<a name=224:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You find the same thing in Hebrews 2, where the apostle, citing Psalm 8, shews how far it is accomplished.<a name=224:7></a> "But one, in a certain place, testified, saying, What is man that thou art mindful of him?<a name=224:8></a> or the Son of man that thou visitest him?<a name=224:9></a> Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands.<a name=224:10></a> Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet.<a name=224:11></a> For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him.<a name=224:12></a> But now we see not yet all things put under him.<a name=224:13></a>" That time is not yet come.<a name=224:14></a> "But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour.<a name=224:15></a>" Mark what we have got here.<a name=224:16></a> Here is God's purpose of putting everything in subjection under Christ without any exception -- there is nothing excepted that is not put under Him.<a name=224:17></a> In fact He created it all, and therefore is heir of it all.<a name=224:18></a> But the point is this, that what He created as God He takes for an inheritance as Man, in order that we might take it with Him; but that time is not come yet.<a name=224:19></a> We do not see all things put under Him; but we do see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, crowned with glory and honour; we see that half accomplished, but not the other half; we do not see all things put under Him.<a name=224:20></a> This is what the apostle states, and the reason of it we get in Psalm 110, which the apostle also quotes in the Hebrews, and to which the Lord Himself appealed in reasoning

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I shall have another opportunity of referring to that.<a name=225:4></a> But I am speaking now of the blessed assurance it is to the saints, that Christ is sitting at the right hand of God until -- and expecting till -- His enemies are made His footstool.<a name=225:5></a> They are not made His footstool yet: if they were, He would not allow matters to go on in the world as they do now.<a name=225:6></a> It is another thing which God is doing now.<a name=225:7></a> He is gathering out His joint-heirs, and, having this purpose, He says, Sit thou at my right hand until the time when thine enemies shall be made thy footstool.<a name=225:8></a> As to the question when that time shall be.<a name=225:9></a> Of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.<a name=225:10></a>" But it is said to the Son, Sit thou at my right hand till that time is revealed.<a name=225:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have the plan then as clearly set forth as language can put it.<a name=225:12></a> We see Jesus, when He has by Himself purged our sins, "set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens," and then by the gospel gathering out the joint-heirs.<a name=225:13></a> And we are associated with Him while He is there at the right hand of God -- associated with Him as united to Him by the one Spirit.<a name=225:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If you will turn now to another passage, 1 Corinthians 15, you will see the way in which we get this place of glory at the resurrection, all things being under His feet.<a name=225:15></a> "As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.<a name=225:16></a> But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming" -- those that are His heirs, they and nobody else.<a name=225:17></a> "Then cometh the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.<a name=225:18></a> For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.<a name=225:19></a> The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.<a name=225:20></a> For he hath put all things under his feet.<a name=225:21></a> But when he saith, all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted which did put all things under him.<a name=225:22></a>" That is, God the Father is not put under Him, but that very exception proves in the strongest

		If you will now look to Luke 19, you will see how the Lord Himself puts it, when He speaks of going into a far country to get the kingdom, and there receiving it, and then returning and executing the judgments to which He refers.<a name=226:13></a> "As they heard these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear.<a name=226:14></a>" They were looking for this, and fancied that, instead of His being rejected as He was, they would get the kingdom with Him in an earthly way directly.<a name=226:15></a> "He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country, to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said unto them, Occupy till I come.<a name=226:16></a>" This is the service of Christians, while the Lord is away.<a name=226:17></a> He has gone away to receive the kingdom, and has not returned yet.<a name=226:18></a> Then He judged the servants when He came back.<a name=226:19></a> "And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called unto him," and begins to take account of their service.<a name=226:20></a> And then, that being finished, he says, "But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.<a name=226:21></a>"

		When this time comes to gather together all things in one, the church of God will be the centre of all things in heavenly places, and the Jews the centre of all things on earth, Christ being the Head over all.<a name=230:14></a> This is what we find stated in the chapter of Ephesians which we have read -- "That ye may know what .<a name=230:15></a>.<a name=230:16></a>.<a name=230:17></a> is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come" -- the time namely of which we are speaking -- "and hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, which is his body".<a name=230:18></a>

		is shewing the exceeding riches of His grace in the place He has given to us, in His kindness towards us.<a name=231:1></a> This, beloved friends, is what I have been anxious to shew you, by bringing before you these various passages, that thus in the ages to come God is going to shew the exceeding riches of His grace in His kindness toward you.<a name=231:2></a> Angels are going to learn the immense riches of God's grace; and how?<a name=231:3></a> By our being made partakers of the glory of Christ, in God's kindness to us through Christ Jesus; so that, when they see Mary Magdalene, the thief on the cross, the woman of the city that was a sinner, any one of us, in the same place of glory with Christ, they may admire the exceeding riches of His grace.<a name=231:4></a> Laying hold of this now even by faith in the teaching of God's Spirit, although we have not got all the fruits of it as yet, we may find our present place very profitable in the way of discipline, and exercise, and spiritual education; still its full development is in the future, when God's kindness to us shall be shewn to the angels.<a name=231:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And now let me try to shew you a little the way in which the Lord brings us into this place of association with Himself.<a name=231:6></a> And first I will refer you to the passage in John 17, where the Saviour states the fact, that the saints share with Him His glory and the love of the Father.<a name=231:7></a> A wonderful passage it is, as shewing that love of Christ which passeth knowledge.<a name=231:8></a> "Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word; that they all may be one, as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us; that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.<a name=231:9></a>" This refers to the present time, or, at least, to what ought to be the case in the present time.<a name=231:10></a> And then He goes on to the time to come: "And the glory which thou gavest me, I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one; I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one, and that the world may [not believe, but may] now that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.<a name=231:11></a>" All the glory thou hast given me, He says -- that is, the glory He takes as man, for s a divine Person, His glory was eternal -- I have given them, and this, that the world, when they see My people like Me, and having the same glory as Myself, may know that thou hast sent Me.<a name=231:12></a> It is not "believe": this is spoken with reference to the present time.<a name=231:13></a> Saints should be one now, as a testimony that there is a power in the Spirit of God which overcomes all fleshly differences.<a name=231:14></a> Alas!<a name=231:15></a> that is not so.<a name=231:16></a> This, too, is a precious

		subject; but I must pass it over just now, confirming myself to the one I am more immediately dealing with.<a name=232:1></a> Of the present time it is said, "that the world may believe"; of the future, "that the world may know.<a name=232:2></a>" "The glory which thou gavest me I have given them, that the world may know that thou hast sent me.<a name=232:3></a>" They will know it plainly enough for their condemnation -- for the condemnation of those who are rebels -- when they see those whom they have been accustomed to despise coming with Christ in glory.<a name=232:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now do you believe this, beloved friends?<a name=232:5></a> Our hearts ought to know and recognise that love -- not fathom it, for this they cannot do, but confide in it, and to that extent know it, although it passes knowledge.<a name=232:6></a> And, as you see, the time is coming when the world too will know that love of God to us.<a name=232:7></a> We pass on to verse 25 -- "O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee; but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.<a name=232:8></a> And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it; that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.<a name=232:9></a>" That is the present good we enjoy -- that the love wherewith Christ is loved should be in us -- that we should have it in our souls.<a name=232:10></a> No one can fathom it: it passes knowledge; but still we are to have it and to know it, and that by Christ being in us.<a name=232:11></a> I am not to wait till the world sees I am with Christ in glory, to know it myself; for the Father now loves me as He has loved Christ.<a name=232:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If you turn again to 1 Corinthians 15, you will see this same truth brought out in its relation to the resurrection.<a name=232:13></a> The point I am now to impress upon you is, that Scripture shews us these two things -- that we are to be like Him, completely like Him, save that He is a divine Person; and that the time we shall be like Him is when we shall be raised from the dead.<a name=232:14></a> It is then we shall appear with Him.<a name=232:15></a> We are not of the world now, but it is said that the world will only know that we have been loved as Christ was loved, when they see us in the same place of glory with Him, when the Lord takes us up to be with Him and to put us in this glory; so that when He appears to the world, we shall appear along with Him in the same glory.<a name=232:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The fact that it is so, that we shall so appear with Him in the same glory, we have seen already from various passages which I quoted on the last occasion; but I shall refer you to some more particularly.<a name=232:17></a> At verse 47 of 1 Corinthians 15, it is said, "the first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven.<a name=232:18></a> As is the earthy, such are they- also that are earthy"

		-- all like to their father Adam; and, "as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly," that is, like what Christ is, not speaking of His divinity; "and as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.<a name=233:1></a>" We shall be like Him, we shall be just the same as Himself.<a name=233:2></a> He does not say merely that we shall be there, in heaven, but like Him.<a name=233:3></a> But first, "as is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy" -- that is, like Adam, poor wretched sinners, mortal creatures, like him; whereas, "as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.<a name=233:4></a>" This is the full absolute statement of the fact.<a name=233:5></a> Then he adds, with respect to the fact of the glory -- putting it, of course, as in the future, not having yet come -- "as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly"; and he goes on, "Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.<a name=233:6></a>" As it is said before, "it is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption: it is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory.<a name=233:7></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now let us refer to some of the passages which shew how Christ receives us to Himself.<a name=233:8></a> I follow the teachings of Scripture throughout, that we may get solidly grounded in what Christ communicates to us.<a name=233:9></a> He says, "In my Father's house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you.<a name=233:10></a> I go to prepare a place for you.<a name=233:11></a> And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.<a name=233:12></a>" He has gone into His Father's house, but He will come again and receive us to Himself, that where He is, there we may be also.<a name=233:13></a> He was going up then with a body, going up glorious, not as yet having all things under His feet, but crowned with glory and honour; and He says to His disciples, You must wait and occupy till I come again.<a name=233:14></a> But now, before He comes, we see what He is to do with us who are in the same glory -- "I will come again and receive you unto myself"; as He said in the previous chapter, "If I wash thee not, thou hast no part <i>with</i> me.<a name=233:15></a>" It was as if He had said, I cannot stay with you, as King and Messiah now, but I am washing you that ye may be fit to reign with Me when I come again.<a name=233:16></a> I am, therefore, still your servant in the sense of intercession and the like, and by My all-prevailing intercession I will wash you daily, because, if you are to have

		In like manner we get what may be called the public announcement of this in 1 Thessalonians 4 -- "Them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.<a name=234:1></a> For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord," etc.<a name=234:2></a> See how the apostle constantly expected the coming of the Lord.<a name=234:3></a> Some people have boldly dared to say that Paul made a mistake in expecting the coming of the Lord in his day.<a name=234:4></a> It is they who are making an awful mistake.<a name=234:5></a> It was never revealed when Christ would come, and Paul did not pretend to know it.<a name=234:6></a> But he knew that that time had come when we should always be expecting Him (instead of saying, My Lord delayeth His coming, and beginning therefore to eat and drink with the drunken, and to beat the men-servants and the maid-servants).<a name=234:7></a> It was, therefore, that Paul put himself in this class, "<i>we</i> which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord.<a name=234:8></a>" And what was the effect of that?<a name=234:9></a> He lived like a man who expected Christ every day; and when Christ comes, he will get the fruit of that, while those people who put off the expectation of Christ's coming, and do not wait for it, allowing their hearts to go out after covetousness and such like things, will also get the fruit of their so doing.<a name=234:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The time of the second coming of Christ is declared not to be revealed.<a name=234:11></a> Paul got a revelation that he should soon die, and he knew it.<a name=234:12></a> Peter also got a revelation that he must shortly put off this tabernacle, and of course knew it.<a name=234:13></a> But it was not revealed to them when Christ should come.<a name=234:14></a> Therefore Paul says, "We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed," Christ having overcome death.<a name=234:15></a> We may all die before Christ's coming -- no one knows the moment of it; still we may use the language, "we who are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord.<a name=234:16></a>" It is said of the man who thinks Christ is delaying His coming, that he turns to what is bad, smiting his fellow-servants, and eating and drinking with the drunken.<a name=234:17></a> And it is said, that while the Bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept, the wise virgins as well as the foolish; that is, the church lost a sense of the present expectation of Christ.<a name=234:18></a> Even the wise servants had to be waked up again; and it was a mercy to them to rouse them up in time, because to His people Christ is ever faithful.<a name=234:19></a> But it is the characteristic of the faithful servant that he is expecting.<a name=234:20></a> The church of Philadelphia was expecting

		The passage in Thessalonians goes on -- "We which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.<a name=235:2></a> For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first" -- nobody else.<a name=235:3></a> I shall dwell upon that at another time, but I just notice it now in passing.<a name=235:4></a> The shout, the voice of the archangel, and the trump of God, are not to be taken as the voice of God to all the world to raise the righteous and the wicked.<a name=235:5></a> "The shout" is a military term; whatever the precise term now equivalent to it, it is that which follows "Stand at ease.<a name=235:6></a>" It was first used with reference to calling rowers in the trireme, and afterwards as a military term.<a name=235:7></a> When soldiers are left to go about their at ease, and are then all suddenly called back into the ranks, it is the command given them for that purpose, to which the word "shout" here used is equivalent.<a name=235:8></a> But the only persons who hear it are "the dead in Christ," Christ being represented as in this way gathering together His own troops.<a name=235:9></a> "The dead in Christ shall rise first.<a name=235:10></a> Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.<a name=235:11></a> Wherefore comfort one another with these words.<a name=235:12></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here, then, we have the details of it.<a name=235:13></a> The Lord has declared that He will come and receive us unto Himself; and now the apostle, by the revelation given unto him, explains how it will be.<a name=235:14></a> He will come and call us up to meet the Lord in the air.<a name=235:15></a> The passage in 1 Corinthians, which I have already read, refers to the same thing, when it says, "afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.<a name=235:16></a>" "But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits.<a name=235:17></a>" The specific thing here is that it is not a resurrection of the dead, but a resurrection from among the dead.<a name=235:18></a> The raising of Christ was not a resurrection "of the dead" simply, but a resurrection "from among the dead.<a name=235:19></a>" This was its whole character -- a taking up from among the dead; and why?<a name=235:20></a> Because the Father's delight was in Him.<a name=235:21></a> And why are we in like manner taken up from among the dead?<a name=235:22></a> Because His delight is in us.<a name=235:23></a> And therefore at the proper time the Lord comes (it is not said, appears) and calls us up to be for ever with the Lord, to take our place associated

		But what we are called to expect is, not to die -- we may die, and a blessed thing it is too, to die; but what we are to look for and expect is, as it is expressed in 2 Corinthians 5, "Not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.<a name=236:2></a>" That Christ's power over death may be fully shewn, He takes to Himself mortal men, whether alive or dead: if alive, He changes them into glory without dying; if they are dead, He raises them.<a name=236:3></a> This is the first thing He does.<a name=236:4></a> He raises the dead first, and then the living are changed; and they go to meet the Lord in the air.<a name=236:5></a> He has predestinated us "to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the first-born among many brethren.<a name=236:6></a>" And, as we have seen, "the glory which thou gavest me, I have given them.<a name=236:7></a>" This then is our portion of heavenly things.<a name=236:8></a>

		And if you turn to Colossians 3 you will see that when Christ appears, we shall appear in this glory along with Himself and be like Him.<a name=236:9></a> He will have already come and taken us up to Himself; and then He comes manifesting Himself to the world, and we appear with Him.<a name=236:10></a> You will remember what I have before quoted, that the glory which was given Him, He has given to us, that the world might know, etc.<a name=236:11></a> Now, turn to Colossians 3, and you will see how thoroughly the apostle identifies us with Christ.<a name=236:12></a> Look first at chapter 2: 20, "If ye be dead with Christ.<a name=236:13></a>" Then, at the beginning of chapter 3, "If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.<a name=236:14></a> Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.<a name=236:15></a> For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.<a name=236:16></a>" He is hid in God; He is your life, and your life therefore is hid there.<a name=236:17></a> "When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.<a name=236:18></a>" When He appears, we shall appear with Him.<a name=236:19></a> There can be no separation.<a name=236:20></a> If He is hid in God, our life is hid in God.<a name=236:21></a> If He appears, we appear.<a name=236:22></a> If He appears in glory, we must appear in glory with Him.<a name=236:23></a> We are heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ.<a name=236:24></a>

		Further, as to this appearing with Him, I shall now refer to the book of Revelation; but, before doing that, you may turn for a moment to Zechariah 14, where it is said the Lord shall come and all His saints with Him, and His feet shall stand in that day upon the Mount of Olives.<a name=237:10></a> This is referred to by s the angel, when, after Christ's ascension from Mount Olivet, he said to the disciples, "Why stand ye gazing up into heaven?<a name=237:11></a> this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.<a name=237:12></a>" Again, in verse 14 of the epistle of Jude, you find "And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints to execute judgment upon all.<a name=237:13></a>" Here they are associated with Christ in the executing of judgments.<a name=237:14></a> "The Lord cometh with ten thousands" -- properly myriads, that is, an I immense number -- "of his saints to execute judgment.<a name=237:15></a>" This shews how entirely we are associated with Christ.<a name=237:16></a> And what a place does not that put us in!<a name=237:17></a> Yet Scripture is so simple and plain upon the point, that it cannot be misinterpreted.<a name=237:18></a>

		You find a distinct statement of their coming given in figure in the Revelation.<a name=238:3></a> At chapter 17 it is said, "These shall make war with the Lamb.<a name=238:4></a>" All the kings of the earth shall be found, not in blessing, joined with Christ, but in open war with the Lamb, joined with the beast.<a name=238:5></a> "These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them; for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings; and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.<a name=238:6></a>" Other passages shew us that angels will be with Him, but it is not angels that are here spoken of as being with Him.<a name=238:7></a> The angels may be described as "faithful" and "chosen," because the scripture speaks of the "elect" angels; but these that are with Him are the "called," and it is the saints who are called by the grace of God.<a name=238:8></a> These "called" persons then who are with Him are the saints.<a name=238:9></a> Having seen who they are, turn now to chapter 19, "And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.<a name=238:10></a>"

		You have seen all through that He is coming to judge the wicked on the earth -- a thing greatly forgotten, that there is a judgment of the quick as well as the dead.<a name=238:11></a> "As in the days that were before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and knew not, until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.<a name=238:12></a>" "His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself.<a name=238:13></a> And he was clothed in a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God.<a name=238:14></a> And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean" -- which, he says elsewhere,

		On the last occasion we found, running through the whole series of passages quoted, that the Lord's coming was the one thing kept before the church as its hope in the Scripture, that it connected itself with every kind of thought and feeling the saints had, that they were even looked upon as being converted to wait for the Son of God, that every other doctrine of Scripture was connected with it, that what marked a decaying church was the thought that "the Lord delayeth his coming," and that what woke them up was the cry, "Behold, the Bridegroom cometh.<a name=239:3></a>"

		Then tonight we have found that the Lord reveals to us with wisdom and prudence His plan, namely, "that he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth" -- reconciling them all in Christ -- not merely for their own selfish good, but as a plan for Christ's glory.<a name=239:4></a> And with this view He has associated us with Christ in the place He takes as Head over all, so that, being associated with Him as heirs of God, joint-heirs with Christ, we have the inheritance with Him; that, when He takes it, we shall have it with Him; that, when He comes, we shall come with Him; that, whereas He was presented to the earth among the Jews according to the promise of God, and they would not have Him, He then took another place -- that of Son of man.<a name=239:5></a> That place He will take in His resurrection and in His glory, and will raise us up to have it with Him when the time comes; and not we alone, but all saints will have it with Him.<a name=239:6></a> Thus we see not yet all things put under Him, but we do see Jesus crowned with glory and honour, and are waiting, as He is, till His enemies are made His footstool.<a name=239:7></a> But when that time comes -- when it will be, nobody knows; God has not revealed it -- the first thing He will do will be to have His body; He is not to be Head without the body, but will catch us up to meet Him in the air; then, if dead, He will raise us; if alive, He will change us, and take us up to meet the Lord in the air.<a name=239:8></a> He will come and take us to His Father's house; for this is our place; and He will have everything there in order for us -- only He must have His heirs with Him; for He cannot take a step in entering on the possession of His inheritance, without having His heirs, His body, His bride with Him.<a name=239:9></a>

		LECTURE 3 -- REVELATION 12
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I intend speaking of this evening, and the idea of which is given in this chapter in allegorical expressions, is, first, the gathering up of the church of God, the heavenly saints, to be with Christ; and then, secondly, if the time allows, the promises which we have, and thereby the infallible certainty of the restoration of the Jews to their place as a nation upon the earth.<a name=241:20></a> Both connect themselves -- otherwise it would be impossible to go into the whole subject this evening –
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		with the manifestation of judgments in this world: only that the taking up of the saints is the taking them out of the way of those judgments.<a name=242:1></a> On the contrary, the Jews who are to remain on the earth, and other Gentiles also, when they come to those judgments, must pass through them, as Lot passed through, and from all that happened to Sodom, making his escape, yet so as by fire, while Abraham looked on upon the judgments that fell on the guilty cities of the plain.<a name=242:2></a> So also Noah was saved, passing through the flood, while Enoch was taken up to heaven.<a name=242:3></a> Those two cases are spoken of as analogous to what shall be at the coming of the Son of man.<a name=242:4></a> We have in these two cases the two things of which I have spoken -- the one class of persons out of the reach and out of the way altogether of the judgments that are coming, and the other class passing through those judgments which destroyed the great body of men, and thus escaping them.<a name=242:5></a> I have said that this class consists of the Jews and some Gentiles also; but I do not enter into details on that point at present -- I wish now merely to present the general thought.<a name=242:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We saw, last evening, that the church forms the centre of the heavenly glory -- under Christ, of course, who is the centre of everything -- and that the Jews are the centre of the earthly dominion, the earthly blessings.<a name=242:7></a> This is what gives their importance to the two points on which, if time allow, I shall dwell this evening -- that is, the taking the saints in the last time to be with the Lord Himself in heaven, and their sharing His own glory and blessedness; and then the Jews brought into blessing with this earth, as reigned over by Christ, and not reigning with Him, but still a great nation on the earth.<a name=242:8></a> These two facts are the two great centres of God's ways.<a name=242:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the chapter we have read you have first Christ Himself and the church figured in the man-child; and then, in the woman which flees from persecution for twelve hundred and sixty days, you have the Jewish remnant -- those who are spared in the time of judgment but are not yet brought into glory.<a name=242:10></a> It thus brings before you the two subjects of which I have spoken.<a name=242:11></a> And I add this, that the consideration of the blessing of the church will lead us necessarily to another point; and that is, that what is called a general resurrection, common to all together -- and I state it now that we may get fast hold of the idea at once -- is a thing entirely unknown to Scripture.<a name=242:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=243>[Page 243]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not deny that it was the notion entertained among the Jews, at least by the Pharisees, that all Jews at all events (as for the Gentiles they looked upon them as dogs) would rise again together; but our Lord corrected this notion.<a name=243:1></a> A right conception on this point is necessarily connected with our understanding the taking up of the church to heaven, because those saints who are dead must be raised for that.<a name=243:2></a> When I say "saints," I mean all the saints, those of the Old Testament, as well as those under the New Testament, dispensation.<a name=243:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And I mention another point for those persons who are not familiar with these subjects, and that is, that God is not now dealing with this world -- providentially of course, He governs all; but that He is not dealing with this world as He afterwards will, at this time while Christ is sitting at His right hand in heaven, and while He is gathering the joint-heirs of Christ to reign with Him when He takes the inheritance.<a name=243:4></a> He alone knows at what moment this will be fulfilled.<a name=243:5></a> Then, when He hath put Christ's foes under His footstool, Christ will rise up from His Father's throne, and take His own throne.<a name=243:6></a> But, while Christ sits on His Father's throne, the Holy Ghost having been sent down, consequent on His ascension, He is gathering out of the world a people for His name, to be heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ.<a name=243:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This lapse of time, this parenthesis in the ways of God, is brought in, in the most distinct way, at the end of Daniel 9; and I refer to it because we should never understand God's dealings with mankind, unless we get hold of this.<a name=243:8></a> At the end of Daniel 9 you find the Spirit of God shewing a certain period which was to elapse before Jerusalem got its full blessing; and you will see the reference that is made to what I was calling the parenthesis, or lapse of time, during which the Jews were all set aside.<a name=243:9></a> At verse 24 it is said, "Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people, and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.<a name=243:10></a> Know, therefore, and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.<a name=243:11></a>" That took place: you know it was forty and six years going on.<a name=243:12></a> "And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off"
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=244>[Page 244]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		-- the threescore and two weeks, with the other seven, making sixty-nine -- "but not for himself"; or rather, instead of this, take what is in the margin, which is undoubtedly the true sense, "and shall have nothing.<a name=244:1></a>" He did not take the kingdom at all; He was cut off and got nothing; in heaven He got all the glory, but He got nothing as regards what we are speaking of.<a name=244:2></a> "And the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined.<a name=244:3></a>" That is -- what almost everyone is familiar with -- Titus coming and destroying the city, until there was not left one stone upon another that was not thrown down.<a name=244:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is still a week left -- we have only had sixty-nine weeks; and here, without entering into details, is the great principle I want you to get hold of.<a name=244:5></a> We have the sixty-nine weeks, and then there is a lapse.<a name=244:6></a> Messiah comes, is rejected, and is cut off, does not get the kingdom at all, gets nothing -- He gets the cross it is true, but that is all He gets.<a name=244:7></a> He ascends to heaven, and therefore our hearts must follow Him up to heaven, while He is there.<a name=244:8></a> Then comes the time of the end.<a name=244:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week.<a name=244:10></a>" For remark what was said before, "unto the end of the war desolations are determined.<a name=244:11></a>" As to the time all is left vague; these desolations are to go on for no one knows how long after the destruction of Jerusalem, the Messiah having gone and taken nothing.<a name=244:12></a> "And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week; and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations" -- that is, idolatry: "abominations" mean idolatry in the Old Testament -- "he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.<a name=244:13></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There then we get this simple but very important fact as to the interpretation of prophecy -- that there was a term of seventy weeks, which would come upon the holy city -- upon the Gentiles too, but specially the Jews -- until all prophecy about them was to be accomplished; but when the sixty-nine weeks had elapsed, Messiah comes, is cut off -- that is actually fulfilled -- and takes nothing; and there go on wars, etc.<a name=244:14></a>, and the city is destroyed; and then there run on the times of the Gentiles; and blindness in part, according to Romans 11,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=245>[Page 245]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		has happened unto Israel, until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.<a name=245:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So again our Saviour, in Luke's gospel, after speaking of the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus, says that Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.<a name=245:2></a> Now that is what is still going on.<a name=245:3></a> Jerusalem is still trodden down.<a name=245:4></a> Christ has not taken to Him His great power and reign, spoken of in a chapter of the Revelation, preceding that which we have read.<a name=245:5></a> Jerusalem is still desolate, and the times of the Gentiles are still running on -- I doubt not, running close unto their completion, but still running on; and Christ is sitting on the right hand of God the Father, according to that word, "Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thy foes thy footstool.<a name=245:6></a>" But while He sits there, the Holy Ghost comes down from heaven to declare that, if man had rejected Him, heaven had accepted Him, and that (redemption having been accomplished, and the grace appeared that brings salvation) He sits there to associate with Himself the joint-heirs of whom we have been speaking.<a name=245:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in the meantime the Jews are set aside, and the times of the Gentiles are running on, and nothing is fulfilled or brought to an accomplishment, because what He is doing is gathering the heavenly saints.<a name=245:8></a> Now those heavenly saints, as we saw in the last lecture, are completely identified with Christ Himself.<a name=245:9></a> He is not ashamed to call them brethren.<a name=245:10></a> He is the Firstborn among many brethren, who have been conformed to the image of God's Son, and are "members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.<a name=245:11></a>" For it is said, "no man ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church: for we are members of his body, of his flesh and of his bones.<a name=245:12></a>" And the saints too are the bride of Christ.<a name=245:13></a> What Eve was to Adam, that is the place the church of God fills in reference to Christ.<a name=245:14></a> And what He is doing now is gathering the saints to fill this place.<a name=245:15></a> It is not the fulfilling of God's dealings with the earth, but the gathering of saints for heaven; and while He is gathering saints for heaven, Christ sits at His right hand until His enemies be made His footstool.<a name=245:16></a> As the apostle expresses it in Hebrews 2, referring to Psalm 8, "but now we see not yet all things put under him; but we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour.<a name=245:17></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is an extremely beautiful thought connected with
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=246>[Page 246]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		this, which we cannot dwell on now, and that is, that if you look for the church in the Old Testament, you can only find Christ, but when you find the blessedness and glory which belongs to Christ, the church is the sharer of it.<a name=246:1></a> So that what we have to see in connection with the fulfilment of the prophecies of God is, that previous to this the church is to be taken out of the scene altogether, because He cannot begin these dealings with the Gentiles in the last week until the gathering of the saints to be heirs with Christ is over.<a name=246:2></a> Until He has got the heirs, Christ cannot take the inheritance; and therefore, all the dealings of God (or of Christ, if you please who is the power of God) -- all these dealings of God with the world -- we do not speak of His providence, of course, for not a sparrow falleth to the ground without Him -- but all the direct dealings of God with the world through the Jews are suspended until the church is taken up.<a name=246:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But you never find in prophecy, until the end of Revelation -- you never find the church revealed in prophecy, except in connection with Christ.<a name=246:4></a> I may give you some instances of this.<a name=246:5></a> For example, I have no doubt that the "man-child" spoken of in the chapter that we have been reading, includes the church as well as Christ.<a name=246:6></a> But it is Christ that is principally meant; for the church would be nothing without Christ, it would be a body without a head.<a name=246:7></a> It is Christ who has been caught up, but the church is included; for whenever He begins to act publicly (even as regards the casting down of Satan), He must have His body, His bride with Him; He must have His brethren, His joint-heirs.<a name=246:8></a> If you examine what we find here, you will see that the church is certainly included.<a name=246:9></a> You read "And she brought forth a man-child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron; and her child was caught up unto God and to his throne.<a name=246:10></a>" The man-child is to rule all nations with a rod of Iron, but there is an interruption.<a name=246:11></a> And as we have seen that Christ came to this earth, was cut off, and took nothing, we get the other side of the picture here.<a name=246:12></a> He takes nothing, but is caught up to God and His throne, and sits at the right hand of the Majesty in the heavens.<a name=246:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This sitting at the right hand of the Majesty in the heavens belongs personally to Christ, but when it comes to ruling the nations with a rod of iron, the saints are associated with Him The quotation is from Psalm 2, where it is said "Ask of me and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession: thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.<a name=246:14></a>"

		That is not asked yet.<a name=247:1></a> And He has prayed for the saints, not for the world -- "I pray for them; I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me.<a name=247:2></a>" He only intercedes for the world when He asks for dominion over them, and, of course, it will be given Him -- it is in God's counsels that it will; and He will take judgment in hand, the rod of iron.<a name=247:3></a> But then the saints will judge the world too; that is positively revealed, "Know ye not that we shall judge angels?<a name=247:4></a> Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world?<a name=247:5></a>" And not only is this stated in the general, but in the detail, especially as to the rod of iron.<a name=247:6></a> At the end of Revelation 2 you will find that this is given to the church, exactly as it is given to Christ.<a name=247:7></a> "He that overcometh, and keepeth my words unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations; and he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers; even as I received of my Father.<a name=247:8></a>" And the same thing is said in Daniel 7, "Until the Ancient of Days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High" (the saints who will be in the heavenly places with Christ, when Christ comes) -- the "rod of iron" being there spoken of as "judgment.<a name=247:9></a>" That is not the most blessed part: the blessed part is to be with Him; but it is true, and it is part of what we have to look for.<a name=247:10></a> And so in Revelation 20, where this time is spoken of, "And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them.<a name=247:11></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How sadly has the sense of this blessedness and glory of the saints been lost!<a name=247:12></a> I was speaking of it on the last occasion -- their identification with Christ, their being joint-heirs, members of His body, His bride.<a name=247:13></a> The sense of all this has dropped away from the church.<a name=247:14></a> It is common to say that it is enough to lie at the foot of the cross.<a name=247:15></a> Now to me it is a blessed thing to see a person coming to the foot of the cross; but it is dreadful to stay there, because for a person to do so is the same as saying that he does not own that the whole thing is accomplished.<a name=247:16></a> It is a want of boldness "to enter into the holiest, through the veil, that is to say, Christ's flesh.<a name=247:17></a>" It is the same as saying that he is unfit to pass through the veil to be a priest in the holy place.<a name=247:18></a> He says, "No; I must stay outside.<a name=247:19></a>" I say that is a very wretched condition to be in.<a name=247:20></a> He must come to the

		In this chapter of Revelation which we have read, you have it positively revealed that it is finished with the saints, as regards all their trials and all their accusations, before the time that the trial of the Jewish people begins in the last half-week of Daniel.<a name=248:7></a> In the first six verses of the chapter, you have the statement of those who are concerned in these last days.<a name=248:8></a> First, you have the "woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.<a name=248:9></a>" This, I have no doubt, is the Jewish people, nothing else; because Christ is not born of the church, but looked at as reigning and glorious in the world, was born of the Jews, "of whom, as concerning the flesh, Christ came.<a name=248:10></a>" There is no kind of sense in the idea of Christ's being born of the church.<a name=248:11></a> Being "clothed with the sun" is being clothed with supreme authority.<a name=248:12></a> She has the moon -- all her previous reflected state -- under her feet: "and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.<a name=248:13></a>" Twelve is the number always used to indicate power -- the power of God's administration among men.<a name=248:14></a> You have the twelve apostles sitting on twelve thrones -- the city built on twelve foundations, and having twelve gates, etc.<a name=248:15></a>, the number being used to express administrative power -- God's administrative power over man.<a name=248:16></a> Well, Christ was to be born.<a name=248:17></a> "And she being with child, cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.<a name=248:18></a>" And so the Jews say, in Isaiah 9, "To us a son is born.<a name=248:19></a>" The church cannot say that at all.<a name=248:20></a> We can say that we believe He is the Son of God; but we do not say He is born to us.<a name=248:21></a> As concerning the flesh, He was born into Israel.<a name=248:22></a>

		Then, having seen who are the persons engaged, you get the woman's place, "And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand, two hundred and three-score days.<a name=249:7></a>" You will see now the reason why I referred to the gap, with regard to all God's dealings with the world, which there always is in prophecy -- without, however, giving any dates at all-between the time that Christ is taken up, and the time that the church is taken up; and they are both united together.<a name=249:8></a> As I have said, it is not merely a notion of men, but it is positively revealed, as God's own order in Daniel 9, that Messiah was to be revealed, and cut off, and take nothing; that blindness in part happens to Israel till the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled; and that then the Jews would be brought to repentance, as Jesus Christ says in the gospel of Matthew, "Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.<a name=249:9></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we get the church, united with Christ, taken up to God, and the woman fled into the wilderness.<a name=249:10></a> Now we come to the progress of events, not as regards the church at all, but as regards Israel and the world.<a name=249:11></a> "And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, and prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven.<a name=249:12></a>" The whole power of Satan will then be cast out.<a name=249:13></a> That is in direct contrast with the result of the church's warfare: "We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.<a name=249:14></a>" This is the conflict we have to wage as to our title to sit in heavenly places with Christ; and the result of this spiritual conflict is, that the power of Satan

		"And the great dragon was cast out -- that old serpent called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world; he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.<a name=250:3></a> And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ, for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.<a name=250:4></a> And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.<a name=250:5></a> Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them.<a name=250:6></a> Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea!<a name=250:7></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		We find here, that while all the heavenly people, that is, the church of God (because our conversation is in heaven and we are one with Christ in heaven) are called upon to rejoice that the accuser of the brethren is cast down -- that they have overcome him -- at this very moment when these heavenly saints have overcome, it is just the time when Satan comes down to earth, having great wrath, knowing that he has but a short time.<a name=250:8></a> Thus we get entire rejoicing in what is heavenly, and at the same time most desperate woe in what is earthly.<a name=250:9></a> This makes the contrast very distinct and definite between these heavenly ones and the dwellers on earth, who, all through the Revelation, are contrasted with those persons who are heirs of heaven, whose citizenship is in heaven.<a name=250:10></a>

		I have read this chapter of the Revelation, in order to shew that while one class of persons -- those associated with Christ -- are caught up to God, and there is triumph and rejoicing and gladness amongst them when Satan is cast down, that is the very time when tribulation begins on the earth.<a name=251:5></a> "And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man-child.<a name=251:6></a> And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.<a name=251:7></a>" There in the wilderness, in this time of tribulation, God takes care of her.<a name=251:8></a> She makes her escape from the tribulation, the figure being employed that she receives this great power of flight, as if the wings of an eagle: and God secures her, not as He did Abraham who saw the destruction of Sodom from the top of the mount, but as He secured Lot who was saved by flight.<a name=251:9></a> The people in heaven rejoicing are like Abraham on the top of the mount; while the woman upon the earth is like Lot, saved by God giving her the great wings of an eagle to escape while all this great rage and power of Satan is being displayed.<a name=251:10></a> "And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood.<a name=251:11></a> And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth.<a name=251:12></a>" That is, providential means were used for the purpose of saving the Jews from the violent assaults made upon them.<a name=251:13></a> "And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.<a name=251:14></a>"

		I shall now refer to a more literal prophecy, which will help us to understand this same interval, these times of the Gentiles, so far as they are going on now -- because I have no doubt that they began in the days of Nebuchadnezzar.<a name=251:15></a> Turn to Isaiah 8, where, after the circumstances of the moment having been spoken of as leading to it, it is said, "Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself" -- a blessed testimony to the deity of the

		Lord Jesus as Jehovah -- "and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.<a name=252:1></a> And he shall be for a sanctuary, but for a stone of stumbling, and for a rock of offence, to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.<a name=252:2></a> And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.<a name=252:3></a>" The Lord, you know, spoke of His being a stumbling-stone, and said that whosoever should fall on that stone should be broken "Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples And I will wait upon the Lord that hideth his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him.<a name=252:4></a> Behold, I and the children whom the Lord hath given me.<a name=252:5></a>" This, you remember, is quoted in Hebrews 2.<a name=252:6></a> Although God is hiding His face from the house of Jacob, Christ says, "I will wait upon the Lord"; or, as the Septuagint has it, "I have put my trust in the Lord.<a name=252:7></a>" And again, "Behold I and the children whom the Lord hath given me.<a name=252:8></a>" These are the disciples of Christ in all ages.<a name=252:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then, in chapter 9, you have the close of all that -- "For that hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of Midian For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and garments rolled in blood; but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire.<a name=252:10></a> For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given, and the government shall be upon his shoulder; and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace.<a name=252:11></a> Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end; upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and establish it with judgment and with justice, from henceforth, even for ever.<a name=252:12></a>"

		Here, then, we have the fact of Christ's coming and being a stone of stumbling, and He says, "I will wait upon the Lord that hideth his face from the house of Jacob.<a name=252:13></a>" Then follows a period of dreadful sorrow for Israel, "They shall look unto the earth, and behold trouble and darkness, dimness of anguish; and they shall be driven to darkness.<a name=252:14></a>" And then comes -- what?<a name=252:15></a> A dreadful battle; only it has the fire of God's judgment in it -- "this shall be with burning and fuel of fire" -- which is a figure of God's judgment.<a name=252:16></a> And then it is said, "Unto us a child is born.<a name=252:17></a>" Christ is this child that was born; but when He comes back, it shall be said of Him, as in Isaiah 53, "we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.<a name=252:18></a>"

		What I refer to the passage now for is, the revelation it gives of the same fact of Christ's coming and being rejected; His waiting upon the Lord that hides His face from the house of Jacob; and of the fact that at last He goes forth in glorious power, in this terrible battle of God's judgment, "In righteousness doth he judge and make war.<a name=253:1></a>" And then it is said, "unto us a child is born, the Wonderful, the Counsellor, the mighty God," and the like, and He sits upon the throne of David to give peace upon the earth.<a name=253:2></a> All this comes after the time that He had been waiting.<a name=253:3></a> His waiting was consequent on His rejection, while God was hiding His face from the house of Jacob, as He is doing now.<a name=253:4></a> But that is not for ever.<a name=253:5></a> I refer to it that if possible our souls may get hold of the ways of God, the framework as it were of His plan: that is, that Christ comes, is rejected, and is caught up to God; and then He sits on His Father's throne, but He does not yet take to Him His great power and reign.<a name=253:6></a> Meanwhile the times of the Gentiles are running on.<a name=253:7></a> God hath hidden His face from the house of Jacob, and Jerusalem is trodden down of the Gentiles till the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.<a name=253:8></a> And, while that is going on, while there is that parenthesis in God's ways as regards the government of the world, Christ, having sent down the Holy Ghost, is gathering His joint-heirs to be associated with Him when He does take His great power.<a name=253:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now let us turn to the accomplishment of this, as regards the church, that is, its being taken up to be associated with Christ; and then, if time permits, we shall turn to the other part, the accomplishment as regards the Jews.<a name=253:10></a> My object will be to shew that the resurrection of the saints is a thing, in nature, time, and character, entirely apart from, and (except in the fact of its being a resurrection) in every particular the opposite of, the resurrection of the wicked -- that the resurrection of the saints is a special favour of God, such as was manifested in Christ's own resurrection, because they are saved already, because they have got eternal life, because they are the delight of God, not as they are in themselves, but as they are in Christ -- that they are taken up and dealt with apart, by themselves, as not belonging to this world's government, except in so far as they are kings of it; whereas the wicked (while it is quite true that they are raised, for Christ will raise everybody) are raised, not however, because they are the delight of God, but because the contrary is the case -- not because they

	<div class="page-number">

	<div class="paragraph">
		have life in Christ, for they have not -- but they are raised for judgment, which is nothing but condemnation.<a name=254:1></a> This is another part of the subject and a very solemn part of it, which I cannot dwell upon now, that the judgment of the nations and of the earth is for condemnation.<a name=254:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I purpose now to go through all the passages which speak of the resurrection, and to shew you that the resurrection of the saints is an entirely distinct thing in nature, time, character, and everything else -- that it is the consequence of redemption, so that now we can look for it, because we are saved -- that it will happen when Christ comes, whereas, when the wicked are raised, Christ will not come at all; but that when He comes He will raise the saints, and the saints only, to be with Him in blessedness and glory.<a name=254:3></a> Mark, beloved friends, how solemn and practical this is for all of us -- that the distinction is so clearly made, that, where the life of Christ is, where we have a part in the redemption of Christ, when Christ comes, He will take us up into glory with Himself -- that we who are redeemed and have eternal life shall appear with Him in glory; whereas, where there is not repentance and a receiving of Christ into the heart, this will not be the case; but when the time comes, those who are in that condition will be raised solely for judgment, and that while all are to appear before Christ, wherever a person has to do with judgment, he is infallibly condemned.<a name=254:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence you find the words which are familiar to all of you, "Enter not into judgment with thy servant, O Lord, for in thy sight shall no flesh living be justified.<a name=254:5></a>" Beloved friends, you can feel how important this is.<a name=254:6></a> It applies the subject we are now considering directly to the state of our souls.<a name=254:7></a> There is no judgment without condemnation.<a name=254:8></a> No man with whom God enters into judgment can be saved; for sentence has been pronounced already, as plainly as God can pronounce it -- "There is none righteous, no, not one.<a name=254:9></a>" I do not know what the great white throne can say plainer than that.<a name=254:10></a> Such is the declaration which is brought home to our hearts; but before the day of judgment which shall execute the wrath, the wrath to come, Christ comes to deliver us from it, and wherever He is received into the heart we are delivered from it, and are placed with Himself -- He is our righteousness, our life, everything.<a name=254:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Before referring to the passages which speak of the resurrection, I will only add in passing that in the very nature of things
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=255>[Page 255]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the judgment of God can never be anything else than condemnation.<a name=255:1></a> I speak of the judgment upon men, not the rebel angels, although it is true of them also.<a name=255:2></a> We have made a judge of God -- and how?<a name=255:3></a> By sin.<a name=255:4></a> God could not judge Adam, if he remained as God created him; for if He judged the thing that He created, He would be judging Himself.<a name=255:5></a> He could not judge him unless he sinned.<a name=255:6></a> Suppose I made this desk, and I began to judge it, I should be judging myself, the workman who made it.<a name=255:7></a> God made Adam such as he was, and saw him to be very good; and while Adam remained such, God could not judge him.<a name=255:8></a> What brought him into judgment was, that Adam left God, listened to the devil, and turned to sin.<a name=255:9></a> What then can judgment be but condemnation?<a name=255:10></a> God may save us out of it through Christ -- that is another thing; but our prayer must be "Enter not into judgment with us, for there is none righteous, no, not one.<a name=255:11></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the resurrection of the saints is the fruit and final power of Christ's deliverance; whereas the other resurrection is the righteous execution of judgment against those who have hardened their necks against God's mercy in Christ, treasuring up unto themselves wrath against the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God.<a name=255:12></a> First, then, as to the nature and character of the resurrection of the saints, turn to Romans 8: 11 -- "If the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you" -- that is, if you are Christians (for if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His), "He that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.<a name=255:13></a>" This is not true of the wicked.<a name=255:14></a> The reasons why they and we, if we are saints, are raised, are totally different; for we are raised in virtue of the Holy Ghost dwelling in us -- that is, because we are saved and sealed by the Spirit of God already.<a name=255:15></a> There, then, we get the principle.<a name=255:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now turn to John 5 and see how strongly it brings this out.<a name=255:17></a> It says nothing as to time, which is comparatively immaterial; but it is a most solemn and instructive passage with regard to the point we are considering.<a name=255:18></a> Christ says, at verse 21 -- "For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.<a name=255:19></a> For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son.<a name=255:20></a>" They both quicken; but the Father does not judge: all judgment is committed to the Son, "that all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father"

	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not want to insist on the word "damnation.<a name=256:12></a>" It is damnation no doubt, but I do not insist upon that word, because the point all through is that it is 'judgment'; it is a resurrection of life, and a resurrection of judgment.<a name=256:13></a> How far they may be apart is another point, which has nothing to do with this fact, that there is a resurrection of life, and a resurrection of judgment.<a name=256:14></a> Where there has been spiritual quickening, where they have everlasting life, they shall not come into judgment, but have passed from death unto life; but then, if dead as to their bodies, they must be raised up to make that life complete, because they must have bodies in unison and in harmony with the state into which they enter.<a name=256:15></a> And on the other hand, they that have done evil shall come forth unto the resurrection of judgment.<a name=256:16></a>

		You thus have the great principle that is involved, and I now turn to other passages which illustrate other parts of the subject.<a name=257:6></a> In Luke 20 the Sadducees put the case that, according to the law of Moses, if a man, having a wife, died without children, his brother should take the wife; and they supposed the case of seven brothers marrying her, and asked whose wife should she be in the resurrection.<a name=257:7></a> It was a quibble they raised, tempting the Lord; and Jesus answered them, "The children of this world marry and are given in marriage.<a name=257:8></a> But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead," etc.<a name=257:9></a> Now what is the meaning of this -- "accounted worthy to obtain the resurrection from the dead?<a name=257:10></a>" You see it is accounted a special favour.<a name=257:11></a> If you only get the resurrection from the dead, you will be "equal unto the angels.<a name=257:12></a>" It cannot be meant that, if people are raised to be condemned, they are equal to the angels.<a name=257:13></a> But it is said, If you get the resurrection, you will be equal to the angels -- "And are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.<a name=257:14></a>" It is quite impossible that this can be said of those who are raised only to condemnation.<a name=257:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again if you turn to 1 Corinthians 15, you will find that nothing can be more plainly set forth than this is.<a name=257:16></a> At verse 22 it is said, "For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.<a name=257:17></a> But every man in his own order.<a name=257:18></a>" Then we get the order of the resurrection, and this is just what we want.<a name=257:19></a> Let us see then if it is to be a common thing, in which all classes are to go up together.<a name=257:20></a> "Every man in his own order: Christ the first-fruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.<a name=257:21></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		And what I affirm is, that not merely can this be proved from Scripture, but that there never is the slightest appearance of anything else -- that this fact I am speaking about is linked up with the very foundation truths of redemption.<a name=258:4></a> Many have redemption who do not see it -- I admit this fully; but nevertheless it is the effect of redemption, and you can see the light that is thus thrown on the fact of my not coming into judgment, because I have passed from death unto life, as stated in John 5, and what the church has lost by losing sight of that.<a name=258:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, in Philippians 3, the apostle speaks of it as his own hope, "And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith; that I may know him, and the power of his resurrection" -- that is a present thing you see -- "and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death; if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.<a name=258:6></a>" Now what is it to which so much importance is attached, that the apostle desires to be made like Christ, if by any means he may attain something very special -- the resurrection of the dead?<a name=258:7></a> When the apostle uses such language, is it possible that all, both the wicked and the righteous, should be jostled up together in the resurrection, leaving it to be found out afterwards which are the righteous and which are the wicked?<a name=258:8></a> The truth is, it is a word used by the apostle in a new sense, in which it is not used in classical Greek, to express a being raised up from among the dead, on purpose to distinguish the raising of the saints <i>from out of</i> or <i>among</i> the dead, from the raising of the wicked.<a name=258:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not like to deal in critical points, but the fact is that in a number of passages the power is lost, because the word is translated "resurrection of the dead," instead of "resurrection from among the dead.<a name=258:10></a>" This was the character of Christ's resurrection, when He was declared to be the Son of God with power by being raised from among the dead.<a name=258:11></a> And we shall be like Christ, in that He will raise us up from among the dead, because we have got the Spirit of Christ, and life from Christ.<a name=258:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I turn now to the proof of this.<a name=259:9></a> Look back for a moment to 1 Corinthians 15, where, having got the order, to shew further how entirely and distinctly it is saints and none else who are raised, we find, "So also is the resurrection of the dead.<a name=259:10></a> It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption; it is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory.<a name=259:11></a>" How can you apply that to a general resurrection?<a name=259:12></a> "Raised in glory" -- can you apply that to the wicked?<a name=259:13></a> It is impossible to read one sentence about the resurrection without seeing -- not that the others will not be raised, but -- that it is distinctly and definitely the resurrection of the saints that is spoken of, because they are redeemed and have life in Christ.<a name=259:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Take again 1 Thessalonians 4 which we quoted another evening with reference to the Lord's coming, and now with reference to which we have already seen, that it is "they who are Christ's at his coming.<a name=259:15></a>" At verse 16 it is said, "For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God; and the dead in Christ shall rise first" -- and no one else.<a name=259:16></a> This is the plain language uniformly held.<a name=259:17></a> It is indeed the capital truth of the New Testament, that as Christ, by resurrection from the dead was declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the Spirit of holiness, so we through grace are (not like Christ in Person but by adoption) also declared to be the sons of God, by attaining, when the time comes, the resurrection of the body.<a name=259:18></a>

		There is one passage which people quote to prove the erroneous notion about a general resurrection.<a name=260:8></a> They cannot apply to that purpose any of the passages which speak of the resurrection; but they quote Matthew 25 where the division between the sheep and the goats is spoken of.<a name=260:9></a> Now there is not a single syllable there about the resurrection.<a name=260:10></a> In chapter 24 our Lord has been speaking of the dealings with the Jewish people until Christ comes.<a name=260:11></a> Afterwards, in three parables, He describes His dealings with the saints; and then lastly He describes His dealings with the nations; and then He speaks of the time when He comes in His glory to sit upon the throne of His glory, and to gather all nations -- the Gentiles, if you please, for it is the same word -- before Him to judge them.<a name=260:12></a> And this is the judgment, whose existence people have strangely forgotten -- that there is a judgment of the quick as well as of the dead -- a judgment of the living (and a terrible judgment it is too).<a name=260:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I now refer to the passage which speaks of the thousand years.<a name=260:14></a> I went over the other passage first, because people are apt to think that this "first resurrection" is merely the explanation of some symbolical ideas which we find in the Revelation; but, as I have shewn you, there is no passage in Scripture referring to the resurrection, which does not shew that there is a first resurrection of the saints.<a name=260:15></a> Turn, then, now to Revelation 20.<a name=260:16></a>

		I wish to refer you to the connection of the passage in 1 Corinthians 15 with Isaiah 25, because the connection of these two things -- the resurrection of the saints, and the restoration of Israel -- will thereby be strongly brought out The apostle says that "when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.<a name=262:5></a>" If you turn to Isaiah 25, you will see that this takes place at the time which we call the millennium, when, the Jews being restored to their place on the earth, there is that era of blessedness among the nations which is commonly called the millennium.<a name=262:6></a> It is there said, "Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a dry place; even the heat with the shadow of a cloud; the branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low.<a name=262:7></a> And in this mountain shall the Lord of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.<a name=262:8></a> And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people, and the veil that is spread over all nations.<a name=262:9></a> He will swallow up death in victory.<a name=262:10></a>" That is at the time the resurrection takes place; for it is said in Corinthians, "Then shall come to pass the saying which is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.<a name=262:11></a>" And thus it appears that the time when the resurrection takes place is the time when the Lord restores Israel, when He establishes Israel's place in Zion, and takes away the veil from off the face of all nations.<a name=262:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I am adding these few texts to shew that the millennium is not spiritual in the sense in which it is often understood.<a name=263:5></a> Whenever God speaks of the earth being full of the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, and the like, it is always in connection with judgment.<a name=263:6></a> You find this in Numbers, when God said He would destroy Israel, that in connection with that it is written "All the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord"; and you find the same thing in the passage from Habakkuk, which I have quoted.<a name=263:7></a> You never find the idea presented of the gospel going forth and bringing all nations under its influence.<a name=263:8></a> In Romans 11 the apostle puts it in this way, "For I would not, brethren, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.<a name=263:9></a> And so all Israel shall be saved.<a name=263:10></a>" That is, he treats that expectation of the church not being cut off, as being wise in their own conceit.<a name=263:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, in another passage it is declared that what gathers together to battle the kings of the earth and of the whole world will be three unclean spirits that come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.<a name=263:12></a> I do not now go into the details of that; but this must be evident to you, that when it is stated that these three unclean spirits go forth to gather the earth and the whole world to the battle of that great day of God Almighty, it cannot be the gathering of the saints that is spoken of -- it is a gathering of the powers of Satan.<a name=263:13></a>

		I have now gone through all the passages in the New Testament, which, so far as I am aware, speak of the resurrection; and I think it must be as plain to you as anything could possibly be, that all those passages shew very distinctly that the resurrection of the saints is an entirely distinct thing from the resurrection of the wicked, being founded on their redemption

		Time will not allow me to enter on the subject of the restoration of the Jews.<a name=264:2></a> But let me just return, in a few words of application, to these solemn truths, that, before judgment comes, Christ has come to save; that, if He entered into judgment, nobody could be saved; that, whenever He enters into judgment, no flesh living can be justified, because there is none righteous, no, not one; but that, because this is true, the Lord has sent a perfect salvation in order that we might escape the judgment -- a salvation that delivers us from the wrath to come; that there is wrath coming, but that there is deliverance from it; and that when God interferes in this way to deliver us from that wrath to come, He does not merely save us from wrath, but gives us a place with His own Son.<a name=264:3></a> Thus not merely are our sins forgiven, but we are united to Christ by the one Spirit, Christ being the Firstborn among many brethren, who are the members of His body, of His flesh, and of His bones; so that He nourisheth the church as a man nourisheth and cherisheth His own flesh, and prays, "Father, I will that they also whom thou hast given me be with me where I am"; so that when He appears, we also shall appear with Him; and if He is the Judge, the saints too shall sit with Him on thrones, and judgment shall be given to them; for, says the apostle, "Know ye not that the saints shall judge the world?<a name=264:4></a>"

		I will refer to this last first, as correcting this very mistake; and this will make way for the direct and positive testimonies of the Old which concern this people of God's election.<a name=266:5></a> In Romans 11 this question is treated: "I say then," is the question with which it begins, "Hath God cast away his people?<a name=266:6></a> God forbid .<a name=266:7></a>.<a name=266:8></a>.<a name=266:9></a> .<a name=266:10></a> God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew.<a name=266:11></a>" Then the case is put of their rejection, and the apostle argues that the casting of them away was the reconciling of the world, and proceeds, "for if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be but life from the dead?<a name=266:12></a> .<a name=266:13></a>.<a name=266:14></a>.<a name=266:15></a> And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree, boast not against the branches: but if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.<a name=266:16></a> Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off that I might be graffed in.<a name=266:17></a> Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith.<a name=266:18></a> Be not high minded, but fear; for if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee.<a name=266:19></a> Behold, therefore, the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee goodness, if thou continue in his goodness; otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.<a name=266:20></a> And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.<a name=266:21></a> For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree," etc.<a name=266:22></a>

		Thus the glory will be restored to Zion when the Lord shall have purged away her guilt by judgment.<a name=269:6></a> Two causes of judgment are there stated: the unfaithfulness of Israel to her first calling; and their unfitness to meet the glory of the Lord when He appears.<a name=269:7></a> In this last (chapter 6) that judgment which the Lord recalls is pronounced, "Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.<a name=269:8></a>" The prophet then enquires, "How long?<a name=269:9></a>" The answer is, "Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate, and the Lord have removed men far away, and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land.<a name=269:10></a>" Then it is added, "But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when they have cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof.<a name=269:11></a>" Nothing could more strikingly depict the long winter of Israel's desolation; but here God would in the remnant give a principle of restoration and blessing, as Paul shews in Romans 11.<a name=269:12></a>

		LECTURE 5 -- MATTHEW 13
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The part of the subject which will occupy us this evening, beloved friends, in treating of the coming again of our beloved Lord, is the sorrowful side of it.<a name=279:1></a> What we had before us in the previous lectures was the blessings and joys of the saints, founded on the sure promise of Christ Himself that He would come again; and we found that their looking for the fulfilment of that promise was connected with their every thought and action.<a name=279:2></a> But it is of the greatest importance that we should look at this sorrowful side as well as the other, that man may see the consequence and effect of his responsibility.<a name=279:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The coming of Christ has a double aspect.<a name=279:4></a> As regards the professing church, and the world at large too, Scripture speaks of His appearing; because then it is that the result of their responsibility is manifested.<a name=279:5></a> As regards the body of Christ, it speaks of His coming, and our taking up to Himself.<a name=279:6></a> It is one thing to own the church as a responsible body in the world -- another thing to look at it as one with Him.<a name=279:7></a> When we turn to that which has been set by God as a system down here, and see the failure of it, it is to be judged in respect of that failure as every system set up by God has been (each having been first established on the footing of man's responsibility).<a name=279:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There is never anything else but failure exhibited in man.<a name=279:9></a> Look all through the Scripture, where we have man's history from the very beginning of creation, and we find nothing but failure.<a name=279:10></a> Adam most signally failed in what God had entrusted him with.<a name=279:11></a> And then when law was given, even before Moses came down from the mount, man had made the golden calf to worship it.<a name=279:12></a> So when Aaron and his sons were consecrated, on the eighth day -- the first day of their service -- they offered strange fire; and, as a consequence, the free and constant entrance of Aaron into the holy place was stopped.<a name=279:13></a> Solomon, the son of David, was given glory and riches by God, but his heart was turned from Him by strange wives, and he fell into idolatry, and the kingdom was divided.<a name=279:14></a> God trusts Nebuchadnezzar with power, and he is the head of gold among the Gentiles: he gets into pride, and throws the saints into the fire; he loses his reason and senses for seven years (a figure of the Gentile empires), and eats grass like an ox.<a name=279:15></a> So with everything.<a name=279:16></a> So it is with the church, and man cannot mend it.<a name=279:17></a>

		If we now turn to this responsibility, we shall find there are two subjects before us as engaged in it; the professing church is one; power in the earth, shewn in the beasts, is the other.<a name=280:13></a> Both are found corrupt, or at open enmity with God that which is called the church will be utterly rejected of God -- spued out.<a name=280:14></a> The thing which Scripture teaches us is, not that we shall fill the world with blessing, but entirely the contrary The evil introduced by Satan, where Christianity had been planted, will never be remedied until the harvest.<a name=280:15></a> Such a thought is humbling, but gives no ground for discouragement, for Christ is ever faithful.<a name=280:16></a> It is the occasion, dear friends, for those who have the grace of God to walk more in accordance with it.<a name=280:17></a> But it is a solemn thing, if what we have to look forward to is the cutting off of the professing church.<a name=280:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		People very often take the kingdom of heaven as if it were the same thing as the church of God; but this is in no way the case, though those who compose the church are in the kingdom.<a name=281:8></a> Supposing for a moment that Christ had not been rejected, the kingdom would have been set up on earth.<a name=281:9></a> It could not be so, no doubt, but it shews the difference between the kingdom and the church.<a name=281:10></a> As it was, the kingdom of God was there in the Person of Christ, the King.<a name=281:11></a> Only as He was on earth, it was not the kingdom of heaven.<a name=281:12></a> But Christ being rejected, He could not take it outwardly then, but ascended on high.<a name=281:13></a> Thus the sphere of the rule of Christ is in heaven.<a name=281:14></a> The heavens rule, and the kingdom is always the kingdom of heaven, because the King is in heaven; only at the end it will be subdivided, so to speak, into the kingdom of our Father, the heavenly part; and the kingdom of the Son of man, the earthly part.<a name=281:15></a> If we understand the kingdom of heaven as the rule of Christ when the King is in heaven, it is very simple.<a name=281:16></a> If Christ had set up a kingdom when He was with the Jews, it would not have been the kingdom of heaven, because He was not in heaven.<a name=281:17></a> Hence, it is said, "the kingdom of God is among you," but "the kingdom of heaven is at hand.<a name=281:18></a>

		You will now see, by comparing other passages, that the church, having a certain responsibility entrusted to her in the earth, has not fulfilled what that responsibility made incumbent upon her, and comes under judgment.<a name=285:3></a> Turn to Romans 11 and you will see distinctly this principle laid down: as to the facts we shall refer to other passages.<a name=285:4></a> There, after speaking of the cutting off of the Jews, the apostle says, "Boast not against the branches.<a name=285:5></a> But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.<a name=285:6></a> Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.<a name=285:7></a> Well, because of unbelief they were broken off; and thou standest by faith.<a name=285:8></a> Be not high-minded, but fear.<a name=285:9></a> For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee.<a name=285:10></a> Behold, therefore, the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off .<a name=285:11></a>.<a name=285:12></a>.<a name=285:13></a> .<a name=285:14></a> For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.<a name=285:15></a>" It is exactly through being wise in its own conceit that the professing church has fallen.<a name=285:16></a> It has looked on the Jews as entirely set aside, forgetting that "the gifts and calling of God are without repentance" -- that He never changes His mind -- that, though He can create and then destroy, He never sets aside His own design and purpose; and that, God having called the Jews as a nation, He never will lay aside that purpose.<a name=285:17></a> But the church has been wise in their own conceits, thinking that the Jews are set aside, and that the church never can be.<a name=285:18></a>

		But we shall find exactly fulfilled, as regards the church as an outward thing in the world, what is stated in this chapter, that, if it continue not in God's goodness, it will be cut off.<a name=285:19></a> This is the specific instruction contained in this passage, with reference to those brought in by faith, after the natural branches were broken off, that is, Christendom, that they are placed on this ground; that, if they do not continue in God's goodness, they will be cut off like the Jews.<a name=285:20></a> The only question is, how long forbearance may be extended to them.<a name=285:21></a> "Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off that I might be graffed in.<a name=285:22></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		We see, then, the cause of the falling away -- that already in Jude's time these men had crept in unawares into the church of God, and were bringing in corruption.<a name=287:3></a> And he warns them that the same thing had happened in the case of Israel, when brought out of Egypt, and had caused them to fall in the wilderness: they had not maintained faithfulness.<a name=287:4></a> He refers them also to the case of the angels who kept not their first estate, because the principle of apostasy crept in.<a name=287:5></a> And mark the way in which he speaks of these men that had crept in unawares -- of these tares that Satan had sown.<a name=287:6></a> Look at verse 14: "And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints, to execute judgment upon all; and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.<a name=287:7></a>"

		Turn now to Habakkuk, where you have one of those passages which are constantly in people's minds, as shewing that the gospel is to go on and spread until it fills the world.<a name=288:3></a> I refer to them merely for the negative purpose of pointing out that they shew nothing of the kind.<a name=288:4></a> Habakkuk 2: 12: "Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and establisheth a city by iniquity.<a name=288:5></a> Behold, is it not of the Lord of hosts that the people shall labour in the very fire, and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity?<a name=288:6></a> For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.<a name=288:7></a>" The people are all labouring in the fire, and wearying themselves for very vanity, and then the glory comes and fills the earth.<a name=288:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Turn now to other passages, where it is not stated conditionally, or in a general prophetic manner, but where distinct details are given of that which would come about.<a name=288:9></a> Turn to 2 Thessalonians, and you will find there the connected details of the course of that of which Jude has already given us the beginning.<a name=288:10></a> But the general fact we also have stated in the Philippians, where the apostle says, "I have no man likeminded; for all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's.<a name=288:11></a>" That surely was an early period in the history of the church to say that Christians were in a state of such decline and decay that they were not seeking the things of Jesus Christ, but their own interest.<a name=288:12></a> When we return to the second epistle to the Thessalonians we get this very distinctly brought out.<a name=288:13></a> "Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him, that ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter, as from us, as that the day of Christ [rather of the Lord] is [not "at hand," but] here.<a name=288:14></a>" The expression "at hand" makes it almost impossible to get at the sense of the passage; it means "here or present," the same word being used as when things "present" are contrasted with things "to come.<a name=288:15></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=289>[Page 289]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The whole point of the apostle's statement rests on this, that the Thessalonians thought that the day of the Lord was "here" -- that it had already come -- that their having got into so much dreadful tribulation and persecution proved that it had come.<a name=289:1></a> The expression "the day of the Lord is at hand" is often made use of as occurring in this passage, while in fact there is nothing of the kind in it.<a name=289:2></a> The Thessalonians thought, not that it was at hand, but that it had come, and therefore the apostle says, "Let no man deceive you by any means, for that day shall not come, except there come the falling away first" -- that is, the not continuing in God's goodness.<a name=289:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Therefore, as the apostle had stated that, if they did not continue in God's goodness, they would be cut off, we have here the positive revelation or prophecy that they would not continue in God's goodness, that there would come the falling away, and that the day of the Lord cannot come until that falling away or apostasy takes place.<a name=289:4></a> So it is plain on the face of it that, in place of the church continuing in God's goodness, the distinctly opposite is the case.<a name=289:5></a> The apostle shews how the declension goes on: "Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition, who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped, so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.<a name=289:6></a> Remember ye not that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?<a name=289:7></a> And now ye know what withholdeth, that he might be revealed in his time.<a name=289:8></a> For the mystery of iniquity doth already work.<a name=289:9></a>" That is the important point here, that already, as to its general principles, it was going on in the apostle's day.<a name=289:10></a> Even then the enemy was at work, sowing tares.<a name=289:11></a> Only it was a mystery; it was going on secretly, in a hidden way.<a name=289:12></a> There was Judaism, and Antinomianism, making high professions of grace with a corrupt practice, and various other forms of heresy, as the denial that Christ was a real man, etc.<a name=289:13></a>, all of which are mentioned in Scripture -- we do not require to go to church history at all to find them.<a name=289:14></a> They denied the humanity, quite as soon as they did the divinity, of the Lord.<a name=289:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We find then that this mystery of iniquity was already at work in the time of the apostle, and it was then only hindered from going on; it was not to be set aside.<a name=289:16></a> The time will come when it will be set aside, when Babylon will be destroyed,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Returning to the passage in Thessalonians, we find the apostle says, "The mystery of iniquity doth already work; only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way.<a name=290:4></a> And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming.<a name=290:5></a>" We get here this very important truth, as regards the responsibility of the church, that what was working to corrupt it in the time of the apostle himself would go on until what hindered the full development of iniquity was removed, and then that wicked would be revealed, etc.<a name=290:6></a> This, as I have said, is the very opposite of continuing in God's goodness.<a name=290:7></a> It is intimated to us, that what was mysteriously working then would ripen and mature up to the open revelation of the man of sin, whom the Lord will consume and destroy -- "Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan, with all power and signs and lying wonders, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish, because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved.<a name=290:8></a> And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie.<a name=290:9></a>" That is the way in which the professing church will be dealt with.<a name=290:10></a> Having refused to retain the truth -- the real truth of God, God will send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie -- "that they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.<a name=290:11></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord then comes and destroys the wicked, the evil being open and evident; it is no longer a mystery.<a name=290:12></a> This is for us a very solemn view of God's dealings.<a name=290:13></a> It is not the pleasant and bright side.<a name=290:14></a> The pleasant bright side is the blessedness the saints will have at the coming of the Lord Jesus, in being gathered together to Him.<a name=290:15></a> The apostle says to the saints, You will all be taken up to meet the Lord in the air, and therefore you cannot think that the day of the Lord is here, for that day will not find you here at all.<a name=290:16></a> That day is the execution of judgment on ungodly men.<a name=290:17></a> It is as if a rebellion were going on at Toronto, and the Queen were to

		say, I will have all my loyal subjects with me at Montreal first, and then judgment will be executed.<a name=291:1></a> And so long as you were not at Montreal, it would be evident that that day of judgment had not arrived yet.<a name=291:2></a> That is the reason why, when it is said Lo here and Lo there, we know it does not apply to us.<a name=291:3></a> To a Jew it is different.<a name=291:4></a> If you say to a Jew who is expecting Christ, Lo here or Lo there, it is a snare to him.<a name=291:5></a> But if it is said to us, we can only answer, It is impossible, for we are going up to meet the Lord in the air, not to find Him here; and I am not there yet.<a name=291:6></a> So he beseeches them by our gathering together to Him not to be troubled as if the day was come.<a name=291:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this passage then which I have read you have the positive declaration, that what had begun in the apostle's time goes on, until Christ comes to execute judgment; and you find another distinct and definite declaration of this kind in 1 Timothy 4.<a name=291:8></a> "Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; speaking lies in hypocrisy, having their conscience seared with a hot iron.<a name=291:9></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, in 2 Timothy 3, we have very definitely and distinctly stated what the last days will be: "This know also that in the last days perilous times shall come" -- not that the earth will be full of the knowledge of the Lord (that is a blessed time), but that "in the last days perilous times shall come.<a name=291:10></a> For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, truce-breakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof.<a name=291:11></a>" That is the character of the last days.<a name=291:12></a> There will be a great form of godliness, much superstitious worship, but a denial of the power of godliness.<a name=291:13></a> That is not a continuing in God's goodness, when the professing church in the last days, with a great form of godliness, denies the power thereof.<a name=291:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a remarkable proof of the power of Satan, that in the face of these passages, men, wise in their own conceits, will bring reasoning to prove that they are to go on and fill the whole world with the gospel -- that, at the very time that judgments are hastening upon them, men will cherish the expectation of the earth being filled with a widespread blessedness

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle shews that the declension will go on, that it will not be set aside.<a name=292:9></a> For "evil men and seducers," he says, "shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.<a name=292:10></a>" And then he gives the resource under such circumstances.<a name=292:11></a> "But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them; and that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation, through faith which is in Christ Jesus.<a name=292:12></a>" It is as much as to say, You cannot trust the church, which will have but a form of godliness, denying the power; your resource must be the holy scriptures of truth.<a name=292:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		You will find, again, how this mystery of iniquity began to work at the very outset, by turning to 1 John 2, where this very question is treated of.<a name=292:14></a> "Little children, it is the last time.<a name=292:15></a>" It seems a remarkable thing for the apostle to speak of the very time when Christianity commenced to be diffused as the last time.<a name=292:16></a> God's patience has nevertheless continued to go on from that time to this day; for with Him one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.<a name=292:17></a> "And as ye have heard that Antichrist shall come, even now are there many Antichrists.<a name=292:18></a>" It is not the Antichrist whom he speaks of, but he says that already there were many antichrists -- already the mystery of iniquity, the spirit of evil, was working -- "whereby we know that it is the last time.<a name=292:19></a>" We have seen that the last days are a perilous time; and here we see that the apostle knows it to be the last time, because there are many Antichrists.<a name=292:20></a> Is it possible then that the last time will be a time when the whole world will be filled with such blessedness

		Turn now to Luke 18, which occurs to my mind in connection with this, shewing how far the professing church is from continuing in God's goodness (verse 6): "And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith.<a name=293:5></a> And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them?<a name=293:6></a> I tell you that he will avenge them speedily.<a name=293:7></a> Nevertheless, when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?<a name=293:8></a>" That is not like having the world full of the gospel.<a name=293:9></a> He puts the question, Will there be some individuals Still expecting His interference and intervention?<a name=293:10></a> but He does not say there will be.<a name=293:11></a> The church will be gone, and the question is, Will there be any looking for His interference?<a name=293:12></a> will there by anyone expecting the Lord to descend on the earth?<a name=293:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It may be well now perhaps to turn to a few passages -- because they rest in people's minds, in looking at this subject -- about the gospel being preached to all nations and the like.<a name=293:14></a> I believe that this ought to have been done from the beginning by those to whom God has given grace.<a name=293:15></a> But that is not the question.<a name=293:16></a> The question is, whether there has not been a failure on the part of the church, as to the discharge of its responsibility.<a name=293:17></a> It is not a question whether they ought to diffuse the gospel -- of course they ought.<a name=293:18></a> In the sixth century, Christianity was the all but national religion of China, and there are fragments of it there still.<a name=293:19></a> The limits of nominal Christendom are now very much contracted from what they were in former times.<a name=293:20></a> Formerly they embraced all the north of Africa, and in a measure all Asia.<a name=293:21></a> Now they are almost confined to Europe, except that in these modern times they include also the scattered populations in America.<a name=293:22></a>

		If you look at Revelation 14 you will find this brought out still more distinctly and clearly, that the end comes when the gospel is sent for a witness to all nations.<a name=294:7></a> You often hear the passage quoted to shew that the gospel is to be preached to all nations, which is no doubt a blessed truth in its place.<a name=294:8></a> But, to see the effect of it, we must take the whole passage: verse 6, "And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation and kindred and tongue and people, saying, with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come.<a name=294:9></a>" It is almost a miracle how people read Scripture without understanding it.<a name=294:10></a> Whoever has been in the habit of frequenting public meetings, and listening to speakers from public platforms, must have heard that passage quoted hundreds of times, as if it meant that the gospel is so to be preached to all nations that it is to fill the whole world with light, while a moment's consideration would shew that this preaching of the gospel is a precursor of judgments.<a name=294:11></a> I shall now refer to the passages which speak of the knowledge of the Lord covering the earth as the waters cover the sea.<a name=294:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, before doing that, let me just quote one passage in Isaiah (chapter 26), where you will see that this is brought, not by the gospel, but by judgments.<a name=294:13></a> Verse 9: "With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee early; for, when thy judgments are in the earth" (not the gospel, but judgments) "the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.<a name=294:14></a> Let favour" (that is, grace, or the gospel) "be shewed to the wicked, yet will he not learn righteousness.<a name=294:15></a>" There must be judgment; the time of harvest must come, as in the parable of the tares.<a name=294:16></a> "In the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly and will not behold the majesty of the Lord.<a name=294:17></a> Lord, when thy hand is lifted up"

		Turn now to Habakkuk, where you have one of these passages which are constantly in people's minds, as shewing that the gospel is to go on and spread until it fills the world.<a name=295:2></a> I refer to them merely for the negative purpose of pointing out that they shew nothing of the kind.<a name=295:3></a> Habakkuk 2: 12: "Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and establisheth a city by iniquity!<a name=295:4></a> Behold, is it not of the Lord of hosts that the people shall labour in the very fire, and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity?<a name=295:5></a> For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.<a name=295:6></a>" The people are all labouring in the fire, and wearying themselves for very vanity; and then the glory comes and fills the earth.<a name=295:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Turn now to Numbers -- another of the only three passages in which what I am now referring to is spoken of in that way; and in chapter 14 you will find what the Lord means by filling the earth with His glory.<a name=295:8></a> When the people had sinned against the Lord and murmured against Moses, God said He would destroy them, and Moses then interceded for them.<a name=295:9></a> "Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people, according unto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.<a name=295:10></a> And the Lord said, I have pardoned according to thy word: but as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord.<a name=295:11></a> Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice, surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it.<a name=295:12></a>" That, of course, is judgment; and the filling of the earth with God's glory here has nothing to do with the gospel.<a name=295:13></a> The Lord will have the whole earth full of His glory, but He does not use the gospel for that purpose.<a name=295:14></a> He does send the gospel, and urges it upon men with infinite patience and goodness; but they reject it; and then comes judgment.<a name=295:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In one other passage the expression occurs.<a name=295:16></a> You will find it in Isaiah 11: "But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth; and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.<a name=295:17></a> And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins.<a name=295:18></a> The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb .<a name=295:19></a>.<a name=295:20></a>.<a name=295:21></a> .<a name=295:22></a> They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain; for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea"

		-- that is, when God smites the earth, and slays the wicked.<a name=296:1></a> "And," the prophecy goes on, "in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek: and his rest shall be glorious.<a name=296:2></a> And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria and from Egypt," etc.<a name=296:3></a> That is, the Lord gathers the Jews, and slays the wicked; and it is then the earth is full of the knowledge of Jehovah.<a name=296:4></a> "And the adversaries of Judah shall be cut off.<a name=296:5></a> Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not vex Ephraim.<a name=296:6></a> But they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines toward the west; they shall spoil them of the east together," and so on -- shewing that there is to be an execution of judgment in the earth.<a name=296:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Turn now to Isaiah 66, where the glory of the Lord is also spoken of.<a name=296:8></a> And, in referring to these passages which are so constantly quoted, it is always an excellent plan to read the context.<a name=296:9></a> In this passage the glory of the Lord is brought in by fire and by sword.<a name=296:10></a> Verse 15: "For, behold, the Lord will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.<a name=296:11></a> For by fire and by his sword will the Lord plead with all flesh: and the slain of the Lord shall be many .<a name=296:12></a>.<a name=296:13></a>.<a name=296:14></a> .<a name=296:15></a> For I know their works and their thoughts: it shall come, that I will gather all nations and tongues, and they shall come and see my glory.<a name=296:16></a>" The glory of the Lord here comes with the execution of judgment; there is nothing of the gospel at all.<a name=296:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You see, then, these three points.<a name=296:18></a> First, you have the statement that, after God had sown the good seed, the enemy came and sowed the evil.<a name=296:19></a> Then you have the conditional declaration, that the professing church, if it did not continue in God's goodness, would, as an outward thing, be cut off.<a name=296:20></a> Then, further, you have the declaration that that evil which had begun in the time of the apostles would go on to the end, the Lord

		only restraining the public manifestation of it until the time of judgment approached at Christ's coming, the fulness of the Gentiles being come in, and then that wicked would be cut off; also that in the last days perilous times would come, and Antichrist would come.<a name=297:1></a> We have seen also that the passages referring to the earth being filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, and the like, are all connected with judgment; and that when favour is shewed to the wicked, as in the gospel, he will not learn righteousness.<a name=297:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If you turn to the Revelation, you will get a little more of detail about the falling away, and about what the character of that evil is which is at work.<a name=297:3></a> But before we quote from the Revelation, let me remark that the two great characters of evil from the beginning have been corruption and violence.<a name=297:4></a> Before the deluge, the earth was corrupt before God and filled with violence.<a name=297:5></a> And in the Revelation, "Babylon" is the expression of corruption, while the "beast" is the expression of violence.<a name=297:6></a> I cannot, this evening, enter into details as to this part of the subject, but I wish to shew you how the one runs into the other.<a name=297:7></a> In chapter 17 the expression "the great whore" indicates the power of corruption.<a name=297:8></a> At verse 15 it is said, "The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues" -- the reference here is to the influence over the nations which a corrupt Christianity has exercised.<a name=297:9></a> "And the ten horns which thou sawest, and [not on] the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.<a name=297:10></a>" Of course, that is not the gospel; it is violence putting an end to corruption.<a name=297:11></a> "For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast.<a name=297:12></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not when Babylon is destroyed that the kingdom is given to the Son of man.<a name=297:13></a> It is given then to the beast.<a name=297:14></a> The effect of the destruction of all this corrupt influence of outward nominal Christianity, of the awful corruption of the Papal system, which was the centre of it all, that "mother of abominations of the earth" -- the effect of the destruction of that, through the hatred and disgust of those connected with it, and disgusted and wearied with it, will be to put the power of the world into the hands of the beast.<a name=297:15></a> There is nothing at all here about the gospel.<a name=297:16></a> It is the violence of man refusing longer to submit to priestly power.<a name=297:17></a> When one reads Scripture,

		simply desiring to learn what it teaches, he cannot but be surprised how people form from it the systems they do.<a name=298:1></a> They take hold of some abstract principle, and following it out succeed in finding it in Scripture according to their expectations.<a name=298:2></a> In studying the Scriptures, they settle first what the Scriptures should teach, instead of being content to take simply what they do actually state.<a name=298:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Turn now to chapter 16, and you will find more about the time when judgment shall be executed upon Babylon, although we cannot now enter into the various details of it.<a name=298:4></a> "And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.<a name=298:5></a>" These are the powers of evil.<a name=298:6></a> "For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth, and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.<a name=298:7></a> Behold, I come as a thief.<a name=298:8></a>" It is the devil who gathers the whole world to that great battle.<a name=298:9></a> People may discuss what is meant by the dragon, and the beast, and the false prophet.<a name=298:10></a> I have very little doubt on that point; and I may just say, without entering into the details, that the dragon is the power of Satan, that the beast is the Roman Empire, and that the false prophet is the false Messiah at the time of the end.<a name=298:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not dwell upon this; but at all events it is perfectly clear that the three unclean spirits, which gather the nations to the battle of the great day of God Almighty, are not the gospel.<a name=298:12></a> It is the battle which in Isaiah is said to be with burning and fuel of fire.<a name=298:13></a> The nations are gathered to Armageddon, and then comes the judgment.<a name=298:14></a> I he beast and its horns destroy Babylon, that great corrupt system, and then the beast and the kings of the earth are gathered by evil spirits against the power of Christ, Satan being cast down from heaven.<a name=298:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Revelation 19, we read that there comes forth on the white horse He who has on His vesture and on His thigh a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords; that the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies are gathered together to make war against Him that sat on the horse, and against His army: "and the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image: these both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone; and the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse.<a name=298:16></a>"

		Thus we get here very distinctly that there is an execution of judgment.<a name=299:1></a> And after that -- after the execution of judgment -- Satan is bound.<a name=299:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then we have a passage, which is the only ground we have for saying that there is to be a millennium -- a thousand years of blessedness.<a name=299:3></a> We have seen the general statements that the world will be full of the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, and that this is to be by judgment.<a name=299:4></a> But the only proof we have that the period of blessedness is to last a thousand years -- the only evidence for this particular character of the glory which is coming -- is found in Revelation 20.<a name=299:5></a> We have plenty of testimony that there will be a time of blessedness, but this specific character of it is only found here, and that is after the Lord has come as King of kings, and Lord of lords, and executed judgment, and Satan is bound.<a name=299:6></a> Satan has been corrupting everything; but, when he is bound, he can no longer do so; and then come the thousand years, and thrones and judgment are given to us.<a name=299:7></a> The saints shall judge the world, for so God has revealed in His word.<a name=299:8></a>

		Are there not many professing Christians who, if you were to say to them, "Do you know you are to judge angels?<a name=299:9></a>" would think you were mad?<a name=299:10></a> And yet it was to the Corinthians (who were very far from being the most perfect of Christians, for they were, indeed, going on very badly) that this was said.<a name=299:11></a> The full import of the connection of the church with Christ has been almost wholly forgotten.<a name=299:12></a> People talk of their hopes of being saved, and of living godly; but the connection of the church with the Second Adam is practically forgotten.<a name=299:13></a> The power of redemption, and the high privileges connected with it, are overlooked.<a name=299:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us revert for a moment to Revelation 17 to see how intimately the saints are associated with Christ in that day.<a name=299:15></a> We read that the beast and the kings of the earth shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them; for He is Lord of lords, and King of kings; "and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.<a name=299:16></a>" That description does not apply to angels.<a name=299:17></a> No doubt He will come with the holy angels; but the expression -- "called, and chosen, and faithful" -- applies to the saints, who come "arrayed in fine linen, clean and white," which "is the righteousness of saints.<a name=299:18></a>"

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another point I wish to shew you, although I cannot go into details.<a name=300:3></a> I can only touch upon the great principles bearing on the subject we are considering, and pass over them very rapidly.<a name=300:4></a> You will remember a passage of sacred history in the time of Elijah, recorded in the Kings.<a name=300:5></a> God had seen that there were seven thousand in Israel who had not bowed the knee to Baal, although Elijah had fancied that he only was left, and they sought his life to take it away.<a name=300:6></a> Acting under God's authority, Elijah raised the question whether Baal was God, or Jehovah was God, and proceeded to test it by a public demonstration in the face of all the people.<a name=300:7></a> And he proposed to test it in this way, that he who answered by fire should be acknowledged as God.<a name=300:8></a> Sacrifices accordingly were prepared, and the priests of Baal cried aloud from morning until noon, "O Baal, hear us!<a name=300:9></a>" And Elijah mocked them, and said, "Cry aloud, for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked.<a name=300:10></a>" And they cried aloud, and cut themselves with knives, until evening; but there was no answer.<a name=300:11></a> And then Elijah built an altar, and laid on it the sacrifice, and filled the trench about it with water, and called upon the Lord; and the fire of the Lord fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood, and licked up the water that was in the trench; and when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces and said, "The Lord [Jehovah] he is the God; the Lord he is the God.<a name=300:12></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we find in the Revelation, that the false prophet brings down fire from heaven in the sight of men.<a name=300:13></a> It is all lies, of course; but he does it in such a way as to deceive men.<a name=300:14></a> The very thing which Elijah did to prove that Jehovah was the true God, the false prophet, or false Messiah, also appears to do -- bringing down in the sight of men the very thing which proved Jehovah to be God; and that he succeeds by it in deceiving men, shews that they are given up to strong delusion to believe a lie.<a name=300:15></a> This refers to the government of the world, so far as the Jews are concerned.<a name=300:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If you turn to 2 Thessalonians, you will see the same, where Christianity is concerned, in connection with the apostasy: "Then shall that Wicked be revealed .<a name=300:17></a>.<a name=300:18></a>.<a name=300:19></a> even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan, with all power and signs, and lying wonders.<a name=300:20></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=301>[Page 301]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Of course they are all "lying," but still they are "powers, and signs, and wonders" -- words verbally identical in the original with those used by Peter when he preached of "Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs.<a name=301:1></a>" That is, Antichrist does the same things -- lying, of course, but the same as regards men's apprehension of them -- which proved Jesus to be the Christ, and the same things that proved Jehovah to be the true God.<a name=301:2></a> By these means he blinds and deceives the people, and leads them away to worship the dragon and the beast.<a name=301:3></a> He does this by bringing down fire from heaven and leads them to recognise the false Christ as the true one, by doing the same things -- falsely, of course -- as Christ had done.<a name=301:4></a> You cannot conceive a more awful and solemn thing, than that men should thus be given up to strong delusion, to believe a lie, and to be subject to the power of him, whose coming is after the working of Satan, with all power and signs and lying wonders; and it is not surprising that the apostle should be so impressive in his warning, when he says, "This know, that in the last days perilous times shall come.<a name=301:5></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, beloved friends, the more you search the Scriptures, the more you will find these great leading principles clearly brought out.<a name=301:6></a> But the professing church refuses to see them; and this is connected with what I pointed out at the outset, that everything which in God's great scheme is trusted to man is a failure.<a name=301:7></a> It was while men slept, that the enemy came and sowed the tares, and then we have the positive revelation that the church, not continuing in God's goodness, will be cut off.<a name=301:8></a> Therefore the notion that the outward church of God, after having become corrupt, will again be set right, is an entire delusion -- I say outward church of God; for, as regards individuals, what is revealed on this point is only a reason for greater faithfulness on their part.<a name=301:9></a> That is another question altogether.<a name=301:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards the duty of individuals, Scripture gives plenty of directions about that, even when speaking of the last days, when there shall be a form of godliness and a denial of the power thereof.<a name=301:11></a> From such, says the Spirit, turn away.<a name=301:12></a> It will be with the saints as with Elijah -- there never will be a time when individually they will have a greater consciousness of the power of Christ, than in the time of general declension.<a name=301:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That, however, is not the point; the question is as to the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=302>[Page 302]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		outward manifestation and outward effect in the world.<a name=302:1></a> Men have comforted themselves with the thought of an invisible church, forgetting that it is said, "Ye are the light of the world.<a name=302:2></a>" Of what value is an invisible light?<a name=302:3></a> It is said, "let your light so shine before men"; that is, let your profession of Christianity be so distinct "that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.<a name=302:4></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And now, beloved friends, take this lesson with you, that, during this time of God's forbearance, until He comes forth to execute judgment, a deep responsibility is laid upon each of us.<a name=302:5></a> Let each man take heed how and what he believes.<a name=302:6></a> Keep in mind that it is by false doctrines that Satan has corrupted the church -- by Judaism, by the worship of saints, and by all sorts of errors.<a name=302:7></a> We have not time to enumerate them all; but it is by the introduction of these false and heretical doctrines that Satan has succeeded in corrupting Christianity: so much so, that, if you wished to look for really the darkest characters of evil, you would have to go among Christians to find it -- of course Christians merely in name I mean, but yet those who boast that theirs is the only true Christianity in the world.<a name=302:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I only add now this thought -- how important it is, if we are approaching these scenes of judgment, that we should understand correctly what is the destiny of the church, instead of imagining that all is to go on rightly until the whole world is filled with blessedness!<a name=302:9></a> How important it is that we should understand that this mystery of iniquity, already at work in the apostle's days, is to go on until God leaves the bridle loose, as it were, for the whole power of evil to do its worst; that the evil is working until the saints are taken up to meet the Lord in the air, and then the power of Satan will begin to work!<a name=302:10></a> This surely is a solemn thought for me, if I care for the church, how I have discharged my own responsibility, when the question is put, as in Jeremiah, "Where is the flock that was given thee, thy beautiful flock?<a name=302:11></a> what wilt thou say when he shall punish thee?<a name=302:12></a>" Read the Acts, and see what Christendom is now, and say what likeness there is.<a name=302:13></a> Ask not only, Is there the doctrine?<a name=302:14></a> but Where is the practice now?<a name=302:15></a> Yet the Lord is faithful.<a name=302:16></a> And, when judgment comes, the Lord, having bought the field, has got the treasure safe, and He has kept it safe all the while.<a name=302:17></a>

		When we turn to the ways of God on the earth, we have seen that His direct government had always been exercised with the Jews as a centre.<a name=303:12></a> Providential government He always exercises.<a name=303:13></a> He makes all things work together for good to those that love Him.<a name=303:14></a> Not a sparrow falls to the ground without Him who is our Father.<a name=303:15></a> But when we come to direct government, the immediate dealings with men on the earth according to

		their conduct, and the direct public interference of God to shew His ways on earth, then the Jews come on the scene and are the pivot round which those ways turn.<a name=304:1></a> But they, when fully displayed, extend necessarily to the Gentiles, who surround them and fill the earth, the great body of whom have now long oppressed them.<a name=304:2></a> Hence, the same passages which refer to the Jews refer to the Gentiles also, as those who come up before God when He begins that government in which the Jews have the first and principal place on earth.<a name=304:3></a> These passages I will now refer to, some of which, by reason of what I have just noticed, have already been quoted in reference to the Jews.<a name=304:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, before doing so, I must point out two classes of Gentiles to which they refer, in respect of whom there are two very distinct classes of prophecy in Scripture: that which refers to those who were enemies of the Jews when God was there with them on the earth -- when He owned them, or will hereafter again own them as His people; and that which refers to those who oppress them when they are not -- when God has written on them Lo-ammi, "not my people," and the times of the Gentiles have begun.<a name=304:5></a> These are entirely distinct.<a name=304:6></a> We get certain powers dealt with which are outside Israel, and are their enemies when the presence of God and His throne are still in the midst of that people, and the representatives of whom will be found in the latter days, when God has taken Israel up again.<a name=304:7></a> But after the Jews turned to idolatry, and, whatever had been God's patience, rising up early and sending His prophets till there was no remedy, He was obliged to give them up to judgment; He then set up Nebuchadnezzar, and the times of the Gentiles began; and they are still running on.<a name=304:8></a> The empire passed from Babylon to Persia, and Persia to Greece; and the Jews were slaves to the Romans when Christ came -- slaves to the Gentiles.<a name=304:9></a> Their ecclesiastical polity was allowed to exist, but the civil power was in the hands of their oppressors.<a name=304:10></a> These times of the Gentiles run on, until Christ executes judgment, until those who were the oppressors of God's people when He does not own them shall be destroyed, and those who are their enemies outside these oppressors shall be brought to nought at a time when they think they have got it all their own way; and then the Jew is set free.<a name=304:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In a word, Scripture shews us that the Jews are the centre of God's earthly dealings; and that as regards the Gentiles there are two classes or prophecy, one referring to the enemies

		of God's people when He owns them, and the other to their oppressors when they are turned off and He does not own them.<a name=305:1></a> Deuteronomy 32 lays the prophetic ground, at the very origin of their whole history, of all that is to come to pass.<a name=305:2></a> In verse 8, as we have seen when speaking of the Jews, they are shewn to be the centre of His ways.<a name=305:3></a> "When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people [peoples] according to the number of the children of Israel.<a name=305:4></a>" Just connect it now with the general judgment of the Gentiles.<a name=305:5></a> The prophet first states that after his decease Israel would corrupt themselves; then he goes on in verse 21 to the wickedness, the fruit of which is going on now.<a name=305:6></a> In verse 27 He rises above the wickedness so as not to destroy them, to shew that He is God.<a name=305:7></a> Then he goes on to the time of His rising up to judgment, leading us to that of which we are speaking.<a name=305:8></a> When Israel is brought utterly low, He will indeed judge His people, but He will also repent Himself concerning His servants.<a name=305:9></a> His hand, as it is expressed, takes hold on judgment, rendering vengeance to His enemies; for such the Gentile powers are found to be, and apostate Jews too.<a name=305:10></a> He makes His arrows drunk with blood, and His sword devours flesh.<a name=305:11></a> Yet this it is brings in the millennial blessings, when the nations will rejoice with His people, for He will avenge the blood of His servants (a thing we have not yet accomplished) -- will render vengeance to His adversaries, and, mark the expression, be merciful to His land and to His people.<a name=305:12></a> Thus we have His people judged, His servants avenged, His adversaries brought under vengeance, yet His land and people Israel coming into mercy, and the Gentiles rejoicing with them -- in a word, judgment, the Lord's adversaries destroyed, Gentiles and apostate Jews, His servants avenged, Israel restored, and the nations blessed with them, but Israel His people.<a name=305:13></a>

		I will now turn, before distinguishing the enemies of Israel owned of God, and their oppressors when given up, to the general testimony of the judgment of the nations, and then shew you the two distinct.<a name=305:14></a> Turn to Isaiah 66: 15, "For, behold, the Lord will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire; for by fire and by his sword will the Lord plead with all flesh.<a name=305:15></a>" We have the great-general fact of the judgment of the nations; and, if you turn to verses 6-14, you

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now turn to Psalms 9 and 10.<a name=306:5></a> They celebrate the judgment and destruction of the enemies of Israel in the land.<a name=306:6></a> The Psalmist introduces the whole subject in verses 4 and 5, "For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne judging right.<a name=306:7></a> Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever .<a name=306:8></a>.<a name=306:9></a>.<a name=306:10></a> that I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.<a name=306:11></a> The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken.<a name=306:12></a> The Lord is known by the judgment which he executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands.<a name=306:13></a> The wicked shall be turned into hell and all the nations that forget God" (verse 14-17).<a name=306:14></a> "The Lord is king for ever and ever: the heathen are perished out of his land," Psalm 10: 16.<a name=306:15></a> These are the two psalms which, after speaking of the rejection of Christ as King in Zion, and His taking the character of universal headship as Son of man in Psalm 8, bring in the whole testimony of the Psalms, the state and feelings of the remnant of Israel in the last days, and the judgment which God executes upon the Gentiles.<a name=306:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence, remark, it is that we find in the Psalms these appeals to judgment, and demands for it, which have often stumbled Christians, when urged by the enemies of Christianity.<a name=306:17></a> They are not the expression of Christian feelings.<a name=306:18></a> <i>We</i> leave the world and go to heaven.<a name=306:19></a> In no sense have we to demand the destruction of our enemies in order to pass into glory.<a name=306:20></a> But Israel cannot have their rest on earth until the wicked are destroyed; and therefore they do demand this righteous judgment, and this is the way they will be delivered.<a name=306:21></a>

		Let us now take a review of scripture as to the two classes of Israel's enemies of which I have spoken.<a name=309:9></a> The chief enemy of Israel, while Israel was still owned of God before the captivity of Babylon, was the Assyrian.<a name=309:10></a> There had been others, as Syria, but Syria succumbed to the Assyrian.<a name=309:11></a> Egypt then sought to fill the scene of the world, and came up, conquered Judea, and met the power of Babylon at Carchemish; but its power was broken, and Nebuchadnezzar became the head of gold over the whole earth, and the times of the Gentiles began, which are still running on, and will till the Lord takes His great power and reigns.<a name=309:12></a> No doubt the Jews came back, or a small remnant of them, from Babylon, to present Messiah to them.<a name=309:13></a> But they were so wicked and perversely idolatrous that God had given them up to captivity, and, even when in their land on their return, they were subject to the Gentiles.<a name=309:14></a> God's glory and His throne were no longer amongst them.<a name=309:15></a> When they came back, they never got the Shekinah (the Shekinah was the cloud that manifested the presence of God).<a name=309:16></a> They had no longer the ark, or the Urim and Thummim.<a name=309:17></a> What constituted the witness of God's presence was gone, and these things were never restored.<a name=309:18></a> There are the times of the Gentiles still; the four beasts constituted the times of the Gentiles.<a name=309:19></a> And this,

		as to the earth, was of the last possible importance.<a name=310:1></a> The throne of God ceased to be on the earth.<a name=310:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Prophecy, indeed, remained till the outward order was restored; but it is remarkable that the post-captivity prophets never set aside the judgment pronounced in Hosea -- "Ye are not my people.<a name=310:3></a>" They never call the Jews God's people in their then standing, doing so only when they prophesy of that future day when they will be restored to the divine favour, which is yet to come.<a name=310:4></a> Finally, when Christ came, He was rejected, and sat down on His Father's throne, and the divine power and glory is wholly above, the object of faith to the believing soul.<a name=310:5></a> The people whom God had called, and who had God's throne among them, were wholly cut off, though preserved.<a name=310:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, the throne of God had ceased on the earth at the beginning of these times of the Gentiles; and therefore, in Daniel you never get the God of the earth, but the God of heaven, because He was not there with them.<a name=310:7></a> The departure of God from the direct government of the earth with Israel for the centre, His throne being in their midst, sitting between the cherubim, as it is said, and His return to the government of the earth, are of immense importance.<a name=310:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Ezekiel we see His judgment on Jerusalem.<a name=310:9></a> God comes (Nebuchadnezzar being the instrument), God comes on the cherubim in the way of providence (those wheels which were so high -- they were dreadful), spares His own whom He has marked and gives up the rest to destruction.<a name=310:10></a> He executes judgment, leaves them, and goes into heaven.<a name=310:11></a> The Gentiles are left to rule, subject to God's providence and final judgment; Israel, with God's throne in their midst, is set aside.<a name=310:12></a>

		Then the Assyrian comes on the scene again at the close; that is, geographically what is now Turkey in Asia and part of Persia, but in the last days Assyria will appear on the scene in the Russian power, according to the testimony of Ezekiel 38 and 39 (a passage applied to this power one hundred and fifty years ago by the elder Lowth, before the present question arose).<a name=310:15></a> And the world, as connected with Israel and God's

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in Isaiah and the pre-captivity prophets you get the Assyrian all through, the beast being scarcely mentioned (once "the king," so as to complete the scene; and even that, I apprehend, as a subordinate ally of the beast).<a name=311:4></a> Whereas in Daniel you do not get the Assyrian, unless, possibly, obscurely in one chapter, and then not as such, the same thing being true of Zechariah, save that all nations are mentioned in both in a general way, brought as sheaves to the floor when rising up against Jerusalem.<a name=311:5></a> Thus far I have been speaking of the general judgment.<a name=311:6></a> Now, having distinguished between the beasts and the Assyrian power of the latter day, we have to cite those which apply to them distinctively.<a name=311:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Turning to Daniel, you get fully the beasts, but not the Assyrian.<a name=311:8></a> Let us examine first the chapter I read.<a name=311:9></a> Here we have Nebuchadnezzar the head of gold, the Persian Empire denoted by silver, the Grecian by brass, the Roman by iron (while the iron and clay represent the present state of things).<a name=311:10></a> Then after these last were formed, a stone is cut out without hands (God's sovereign work), smites the image, when all becomes as the chaff of the summer threshing floor, and no place is found for them; and then the stone that smote the image became a great mountain which filled the whole earth.<a name=311:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is not here, remark, a trace of influence exercised over the previous component parts of the image so as to produce a change of character.<a name=311:12></a> The notion is that Christianity will spread and pervade these countries.<a name=311:13></a> Now the stone does not grow at all till they are entirely destroyed.<a name=311:14></a> There is no influence exercised, no modification takes place, no change at all is spoken of here.<a name=311:15></a> The little stone destroys all before it increases.<a name=311:16></a> It is the stone which has smitten the image, which grows.<a name=311:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What we have got here is the coming of Christ's kingdom in judgment, and a total destruction of the empires which preceded its action.<a name=311:18></a> That action was on the last, and more particularly on the toes of iron and clay -- the last form which

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What is going on now is not this.<a name=312:3></a> Christ has ascended up on high and He waits, in the spirit of grace, sitting on the right hand of His Father's throne, while the saints, His co-heirs, the church, is gathering out of the world; until, at the moment known to God alone, He rises up from the Father's throne, then to take to Him His great power and reign, His enemies being now put under His feet.<a name=312:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Turn now to the interpretation itself, which is perfectly clear on this point.<a name=312:5></a> Power in the world is entrusted to man in the person of Nebuchadnezzar; three empires succeed his, and at the end, though there be a strength in the last which breaks in pieces and subdues all around it, yet a conflict of principles characterises its latter form (I have little doubt the Teutonic and Latin elements); and it is partly strong and partly broken.<a name=312:6></a> But then the close comes, verse 44: "And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.<a name=312:7></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		You will remember, beloved friends, that on the last evening we saw the general outline of God's dealings with the Gentiles in connection with His chosen earthly people, the Jews (they being the centre of all God's earthly dealings).<a name=312:8></a> First, that at the restoration of the Jews there would be the judgment of the Gentiles, the nations being divided into two classes, those that were enemies to God's people when God owned them and had His throne in their midst, and those who led them captive and oppressed them when God did not own them.<a name=312:9></a> Both will be cast out from the seat of power.<a name=312:10></a> It is evident that, as regards the world, it is an all-important fact, God's taking His throne from it.<a name=312:11></a> When that took place, He was no longer the God of the earth, though He over-rules all things providentially, but does not exercise direct government as in Israel when His throne was there.<a name=312:12></a> Hence Daniel calls Him the God of heaven, and it is not until He comes to judge the world that He takes His name of God of the earth, Lord of the whole earth.<a name=312:13></a> (See Zechariah 14.<a name=312:14></a>)

		The distinction of these two classes is important to us because we are in the times of the Gentiles.<a name=313:4></a> In the prophecies there is never the slightest confusion between the two.<a name=313:5></a> The Assyrian, and finally Gog, is the great enemy of Israel when the people is owned, the four beasts or Gentile empires their oppressors when they are not.<a name=313:6></a> The prophets up to the captivity and Ezekiel speak of the former, Daniel and Zechariah of the latter, to which (when we come to the New Testament) we must add Revelation.<a name=313:7></a> The whole New Testament history is under the last beast.<a name=313:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The first, fullest, and most general account of these is in chapter 7 of Daniel, which we have read.<a name=313:9></a> If we turn to it now for a moment, we shall see that it is divided into portions by the terms "I saw in the night visions.<a name=313:10></a>" First, we have, verses 1-6, the fact of the four great empires and a brief account of three; the next division, beginning with verses 7-12, a particular description of the fourth beast, and then a throne set up and judgment.<a name=313:11></a> Verse 13 begins another division, in which the kingdom is given to the Son of man.<a name=313:12></a> After this we have the explanation given to Daniel by the angel, in which the condition of the saints under the beasts and particularly the last beast, and, finally under the Son of man, is given.<a name=313:13></a> They are beasts as having lost their intelligence towards God, not owning Him, and doing their own will in ravening power as far as they can.<a name=313:14></a> Of this the madness of Nebuchadnezzar was a figure.<a name=313:15></a>

		The first three great empires are, Babylon (the head of gold); the bear, Persia (silver); the leopard, Grecian (brass).<a name=313:16></a> On these I do not dwell: they are past.<a name=313:17></a> The fourth beast, described as we have seen apart more particularly, is the Roman; you find him represented as fierce and powerful, tearing and devouring -- not simple conquest, but putting all

	<div class="paragraph">
		Verses 7, 8: "After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it; and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.<a name=314:3></a> I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots, and behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.<a name=314:4></a>" You will remark that there is a special power here (a horn, the symbol of power or a kingdom); before it three of the kingdoms fall.<a name=314:5></a> Its general character is given here.<a name=314:6></a> We shall see the details farther on.<a name=314:7></a> It has eyes of man: eyes here mean intelligence, insight into things.<a name=314:8></a> His mouth speaks great things, saying, Who is Lord over us?<a name=314:9></a> Nor is this all -- that his lips are his own, as the psalm speaks; but he will not allow of God.<a name=314:10></a>

		"I beheld till the thrones were cast down [here with the LXX and best judges we must read "set," which falls in with the sense indeed of the whole passage], and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool; his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.<a name=314:11></a> A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him; the judgment was set, and the books were opened.<a name=314:12></a> I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake: I beheld even till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame.<a name=314:13></a>" The first three powers, you may remark, had their dominion taken away (their power was destroyed), but subsisted afterwards as subject kingdoms; whereas, when the Roman Empire is put an end to, it is destroyed utterly.<a name=314:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		To this we must now turn.<a name=314:15></a> It has an importance which none of the others have, though Babylon has a special character.<a name=314:16></a> It was the Roman Empire that was in power when Christ was born and took part in His rejection through Pilate, and hereafter they will join Antichrist when he comes.<a name=314:17></a> The prophet

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Remark, too, the clear proof we have of what I drew your attention to as so important in speaking of chapter 2, namely, that the kingdom is not assumed by the Son of man till the judgment is executed.<a name=315:5></a> He may and will destroy the beast by His power; but it is only when it is destroyed that His own kingdom is established.<a name=315:6></a> It cannot be along with evil.<a name=315:7></a> This is the question of the expectant and suffering Jew in Psalm 94: 20.<a name=315:8></a> It is not now, but after the judgment, that the growth of Christ's kingdom takes place.<a name=315:9></a> He is sitting at the right hand of God, but comes thence to take the kingdom with glory and power; He is gathering in now the joint-heirs.<a name=315:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next, we find here that what is brought out as the cause of this judgment is the great words of blasphemy of the little horn.<a name=315:11></a> There cannot be a more definite statement that the glory and kingdom of Christ is consequent on the judgment.<a name=315:12></a> I insist upon this, because it bears upon everything we are treating of, and determines our whole view of the nature of Christ's kingdom.<a name=315:13></a> There is no change in the principle of sin, in the first Adam, but it goes on to the end.<a name=315:14></a> It was lawless at the beginning, breaking law when law was given, rose up against the Lord in hatred to God when He was made flesh and dwelt among us; and, Satan having throughout corrupted the church as we have seen, his power is allowed to unfold itself in the beasts, and in the last beast ripens to a head, and leads the kings of this earth to make war with the Lamb (the lawless one, the man of sin, being then openly revealed).<a name=315:15></a> Our portion, as we have seen, is in the Lord, nor will the fruitful power of His grace towards us cease till we shall be like Himself.<a name=315:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But though the kings of the earth stand up together, and the rulers take counsel together, yet God will set His King upon His holy hill of Zion.<a name=315:17></a> Here, however, the aspect of His power is somewhat different, He is seen as Son of man, a term of wider dominion than Son of David, in which Psalm 2 views Him; but even there the heathen are given to Him for an inheritance, and He breaks them in pieces like a potter's vessel.<a name=315:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=316>[Page 316]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The difference is this, that here the kingdom is given and possessed as a dominion, in Psalm 2 it is established by judicial power.<a name=316:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We now come to the interpretation in which this very judgment is spoken of, some immensely important truths besides being brought out.<a name=316:2></a> In the prophecy nothing had been said of the saints, heavenly or earthly: here we shall find both -- I do not say the church, but still heavenly saints.<a name=316:3></a> Indeed, when God's mind is thus given, and not merely the outward facts, the connection of these events with the saints is the principal point.<a name=316:4></a> Verse 17, "These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth.<a name=316:5></a> But the saints of the Most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.<a name=316:6></a>" The saints will do it, not the Son of man only.<a name=316:7></a> Verse 21, "I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them; until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.<a name=316:8></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here you will first remark the extremely important point that the Ancient of days Himself comes.<a name=316:9></a> For though Christ, as man, is gone to receive a kingdom and to return; yet the Son of man is the Ancient of days.<a name=316:10></a> So it is said in Timothy that the King of kings and the Lord of lords would shew Christ in glory.<a name=316:11></a> But in the Revelation Christ comes as King of kings and Lord of lords: and I may add, in another relationship, the traits of the Ancient of days in Daniel are found in the Son of man who walks in the midst of the golden candlesticks.<a name=316:12></a> He is there distinctly both -- Son over His own house who built all things.<a name=316:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another term calls for remark here -- the saints of the Most High; or, as in the margin, heavenly places, which we find again in Ephesians as the place of the saints; yet it is immediately connected with the name God takes as possessor of heaven and earth.<a name=316:14></a> It is not here the church, but all the saints who have their dwelling in heavenly places in connection with the kingdom, yet in a state of eternal glory.<a name=316:15></a> God took the name of God Almighty in relationship with Abraham, of Jehovah with Israel, of Father, in grace, with us.<a name=316:16></a> Thus Abraham was to be perfect, walking before God Almighty: Israel was to be perfect with Jehovah their God.<a name=316:17></a> We are called to be perfect

		as our Father which is in heaven is perfect.<a name=317:1></a> We are before God as Christ; but as He is in us, we are called to display the divine nature, to be imitators of God as dear children, and walk in love as Christ loved us.<a name=317:2></a> But the name of Most High is the expression of God's sovereign dominion, above all that is called God, the Supreme.<a name=317:3></a> So, when Abraham returned from the slaughter of the kings (figure of Israel's deliverance and final victory in the latter day), Melchizedek (the figure of Christ as King and Priest, Priest upon His throne in the world to come, King of righteousness, King of peace) comes forward and blesses Abraham on the part of the Most High God possessor of heaven and earth, and blesses the Most High in Abraham's name.<a name=317:4></a> In our chapter the saints have their name in connection with this; and indeed it is applied to God (with the difference then of being singular, instead of plural).<a name=317:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Meanwhile tribulation and trial is the portion of those on earth.<a name=317:6></a> The little blasphemous horn who speaks such great things makes war with the saints.<a name=317:7></a> This is the general character.<a name=317:8></a> Of course they must be down here.<a name=317:9></a> Those on high he can only blaspheme.<a name=317:10></a> I do not believe this little horn to be Antichrist; the source of persecution is ever the traditional religious power.<a name=317:11></a> Antichrist will be in direct association with him and urges him to it: of this hereafter.<a name=317:12></a> But this is the last active power of evil in the Roman Empire or beast whose names of blasphemy are on it: of this also farther on.<a name=317:13></a> This persecution will continue till God's power interferes.<a name=317:14></a> This is stated in a very important verse: he prevails till the Ancient of days came (here we see that the Son of man is the Ancient of days, for we know that the Son of man comes); and thus a total change takes place, judgment is given to the saints of the high places, and the time is come that the saints possess the kingdom.<a name=317:15></a> He does not say saints of the Most High here, for on earth and in blessing the earthly saints will possess the kingdom, as in Matthew 25; but judgment is given only to the saints of the Most High.<a name=317:16></a> The Ancient of days then comes, judgment is given to the heavenly saints (compare Revelation 20: 4, where we read that judgment was given unto them, and they live and reign with Christ a thousand years), and the saints possess the kingdom.<a name=317:17></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I pursue the explanation.<a name=318:2></a> Verse 24, "And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise, and another shall arise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.<a name=318:3></a> And he shall speak great words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and think to change times and laws; and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.<a name=318:4></a>" Most High, the first time it is mentioned here, is God Himself.<a name=318:5></a> "Times and laws" refer to Jews entirely; the words are terms which refer to their statutes and ordinances.<a name=318:6></a> These (not the saints) are given into his hands.<a name=318:7></a> God never gives His saints into their enemies' hands, though He may use these as a rod.<a name=318:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When that time comes, the beast at first makes his covenant with Israel, according to Daniel 9: 27 -- first joins with them, then breaks with them, and makes the sacrifice and oblation to cease.<a name=318:9></a> All the Jewish order which had been set up in pride will be completely upset, as in Isaiah 18: "They shall be left together unto the fowls of the mountains, and to the beasts of the earth: and the fowls shall summer upon them, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them.<a name=318:10></a>" They are brought into such trouble as never was since there was a nation, no, nor ever will be.<a name=318:11></a> It is the time, times, and half a time -- the great tribulation.<a name=318:12></a> The verse gives in few words, but precisely, the state of things when the little horn is wearing out the saints of God.<a name=318:13></a><a href="#318:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> Satan will be cast out of heaven and have come down, as we have seen, in great rage, having but a short time.<a name=318:14></a> Before that period everything is given into the power of the beast.<a name=318:15></a> Then the Lord, the Ancient of days, who is come, takes all into His hands.<a name=318:16></a> "A short work will the Lord make upon the earth.<a name=318:17></a>" For the judgment shall sit; the kingdom shall be given to the people of the saints of the

		In order to get that clear a little, we turn to the Revelation, for there we find the history of this beast unfolded in chapter 13.<a name=319:2></a> I shall refer to it fully farther on; here, only to notice its character and what it is.<a name=319:3></a> It is the Roman beast, with seven heads and ten horns.<a name=319:4></a> It receives its power from the dragon, blasphemes God and those in heaven, and makes war with the saints.<a name=319:5></a> It is ministered to spiritually by the deceitful power of Satan.<a name=319:6></a> It is the instrument of Satan's power in the earth when he is cast out of heaven.<a name=319:7></a> Already, as the dragon, the Romans had joined in rejecting Christ.<a name=319:8></a> The Roman beast is the only one which has done it in the person of Pilate.<a name=319:9></a> But then Christ owned the power as of God, as it was.<a name=319:10></a> He said "Thou couldest have no power at all against me except it were given thee from above" (John 19: 11), though Satan's influence, as prince of this world, was guiding the use of that power.<a name=319:11></a> Then judgment was on one side, perfect righteousness on the other.<a name=319:12></a> When Christ comes again, judgment will return to righteousness.<a name=319:13></a> They will be reconciled in one, as it is in Psalm 94: "The Lord will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance.<a name=319:14></a> But judgment shall return unto righteousness, and all the upright in heart shall follow it.<a name=319:15></a>" Till then the saints must not expect it.<a name=319:16></a> God may hold the reins and control to His own purposes the powers that be whom He has ordained -- may give thus all quietness, as we surely experience it and have to thank Him for; but we must not expect the motives of government to be righteousness as God sees it.<a name=319:17></a> It is the time to do well, suffer for it, and take it patiently, as Jesus did; and when God looses the reins to evil, when Satan is come to the earth, then the full true character of evil power from Satan will be manifested.<a name=319:18></a> "The dragon gave him his power, and his seat and great authority," Revelation 13: 2.<a name=319:19></a> Such is the Roman beast in its final state during the time, times, and half a time.<a name=319:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The distinct and definite place and character of this period become as plain as possible if we consult the end of Daniel 9.<a name=319:21></a> The prophet receives from the heavenly messenger the assurance that the Jews will be restored.<a name=319:22></a> "Know, therefore, and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times: and after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off and shall have nothing,"

	<div class="paragraph">
		The last week thus remains.<a name=320:7></a> In the first half indeed Messiah was there, but rejected by the nation and owned only by the remnant.<a name=320:8></a> At the end Antichrist is owned by the nation, rejected by the remnant.<a name=320:9></a> The beast makes a covenant with the Jews for that week, but breaks it in the midst of the week, the half-week remains unaccomplished.<a name=320:10></a> You get then three and a half years that remain to be accomplished, when abominations (i.<a name=320:11></a>e.<a name=320:12></a>, idolatry) will overspread the Jewish people, the times and laws will be changed.<a name=320:13></a> At that very time Satan is come down (in chapter 12 of Revelation), and the woman, the true remnant in Jerusalem, flees into the wilderness for a time, times, and half a time.<a name=320:14></a> This is Daniel's half-week.<a name=320:15></a> You get it thus perfectly clear.<a name=320:16></a> The remnant owned Christ, but the Jews did not.<a name=320:17></a> You get the sixty-nine weeks, and then a long parenthesis in which Christ is set aside and the Jews on the earth, "desolations being determined," which goes on until the time of the Gentiles is fulfilled.<a name=320:18></a> During this period the church, the heavenly thing, is called.<a name=320:19></a>

		Thus the time we are in is not reckoned at all.<a name=320:20></a> So the prophets (who do not speak of the times of the Gentiles as Daniel does) pass it over altogether and connect Christ's second coming to earth with His first.<a name=320:21></a> We have a very remarkable proof of this from the Lord Himself, when quoting from Isaiah 61: "The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.<a name=320:22></a>"

		All this time the interval in the midst of Daniel's week runs on without being counted.<a name=321:4></a> We do not count by time in heaven, and this is the time of the heavenly calling.<a name=321:5></a> This is evident from the passage in Daniel 9, for the weeks go on to sixty-nine; then all is vague to the one week at the end; but as soon as ever God takes the Jews up again, Daniel's week begins again.<a name=321:6></a> If you apply therefore the time, times, and half a time, or the forty-two months, or the twelve hundred and sixty days (which are precisely the same time, three hundred and sixty days being counted to a year, and the five intercalary days or next days being left out), to the intervening epoch, you are necessarily on false ground.<a name=321:7></a> I believe there is an analogy, as there are many Antichrists though they are not the Antichrist, proving in a moral sense we have been in the last days since the apostle's time.<a name=321:8></a> But the moment you come to be precise, it all falls to the ground, although there is an analogy.<a name=321:9></a> The counting of time belongs entirely to the Jews, and the three years and a half begin to run when they are again on the scene, when Satan has been cast down, and the beast has assumed a diabolical character -- is come up out of the abyss.<a name=321:10></a>

		In chapter 20 We have a full development of what we read in Daniel 7.<a name=326:3></a> We get in the Revelation the history of the last beast more fully developed (that is, of the Roman Empire, which had already rejected Christ when on earth in conjunction with the Jews).<a name=326:4></a> Consequent on the exaltation of Christ to the right hand of God, the Jews being set aside as a nation, the church was formed.<a name=326:5></a> She does not belong to the world, but is the bride of Christ in heavenly places.<a name=326:6></a> Then when the church is caught up, the beast which seemed to have been destroyed is found in a new form -- still as such -- its deadly wound being healed; and as he had joined in rejecting Christ, he is now in the closest connection with Antichrist.<a name=326:7></a> At the first he deals with the Jews, makes a covenant with them, but in the last half week of Daniel turns against them, persecutes them, changes times and laws, makes the sacrifice and oblation to cease.<a name=326:8></a> The king, the Antichrist, establishes idolatry, and divides their land.<a name=326:9></a> You read his character in this point of view in Daniel 11: 36: "And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished; for that that is determined shall be done.<a name=326:10></a>" In a word, in Daniel, as in the part of Revelation I have referred to, is the testimony of the beast, the last form of the power which oppresses Israel when they are captive, and does so until the Lord comes and delivers, though He judges them.<a name=326:11></a>

		Now look at the end of chapter 30, and you will find this enemy and his end: "For through the voice of the Lord shall the Assyrian be beaten down, which smote with a rod.<a name=327:10></a> And in every place where the grounded staff shall pass, which the Lord shall lay upon him, it shall be with tabrets and harps: and in battles of shaking will he fight with it.<a name=327:11></a> For Tophet is ordained of old; yea, for the king [or, as I believe, "also for the king"] it is prepared; he hath made it deep and large; the pile thereof is fire and much wood; the breath of the Lord, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it.<a name=327:12></a>"

		I get here this other fundamental principle: When Israel is restored, then the heathen themselves -- judged that it may be so -- understand that Jehovah, the God of Israel, is the Most High over all the earth, and submit to Him.<a name=331:3></a> You will see how Psalm 8 expresses this: "O Jehovah our Lord," says Israel, when Christ is set up, not simply as Son of David, according to Psalm 2, which will indeed now be accomplished, but as Son of man, "how excellent is thy name in all the earth!<a name=331:4></a>" This is the prayer of Psalm 67.<a name=331:5></a> I should multiply quotations too much were I to quote all the Psalms which speak of this.<a name=331:6></a> I will allude to a remarkable series -- Psalms 94-100.<a name=331:7></a> Psalm 94 calls for judgment; Psalm 95 summons Israel to repentance; Psalm 96 the heathen are called to own Jehovah, for He is coming to judge the world in righteousness; in Psalm 97 He is actually coming in clouds; in Psalm 98 the Lord is come and has made known His salvation; in Psalm 99 He is known upon the earth again, and is sitting between the cherubim; and Psalm 100 calls on all nations to come and worship Him now that His throne is set up on earth for blessing.<a name=331:8></a> The cry for vengeance and deliverance is the cry of the remnant, from the time of God's bringing back the people till His sitting on the throne of judgment.<a name=331:9></a> He will send deliverance by power.<a name=331:10></a> The throne of iniquity will not share the power with Him.<a name=331:11></a> Now, grace calls souls from the evil, to come to God and go to heaven, and grace characterises the Christian, though he knows vengeance will come.<a name=331:12></a>

		BRIEF REMARKS ON THE WORK OF THE REVEREND DAVID BROWN, D.D., ENTITLED "CHRIST'S SECOND COMING; IS IT PRE-MILLENNIAL?"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have, in the lectures delivered at Toronto, stated my views at length as to the Lord's coming, and the divine purposes and plans in connection with that great event.<a name=333:1></a> I do not repeat them here, merely summing up in a sentence or two the whole scheme.<a name=333:2></a> But since I delivered those lectures, Dr.<a name=333:3></a> Brown's "Second Advent" has been put into my hands as a kind of unanswerable text-book of those who oppose Christ's pre-millennial advent.<a name=333:4></a> My object therefore here has been to shew the utter untenableness of his views, and unscriptural character of his arguments.<a name=333:5></a> I have been as brief as possible, answering a book of nearly five hundred pages in a not very long tract, but I do not think I have omitted anything very material.<a name=333:6></a> I have found difficulties greater than those he has alleged, and I believe have solved them, and by a principle Dr.<a name=333:7></a> B.<a name=333:8></a> admits, so that I have not gone into them in detail here.<a name=333:9></a> The direct proofs of Christ's second advent I believe to be irrefragable for one taught of God -- His advent to judge the world and bless it before the end.<a name=333:10></a> I have not thought it necessary to follow Dr.<a name=333:11></a> B.<a name=333:12></a> in all his comments on men's views.<a name=333:13></a> It sufficed to take up those of Scripture.<a name=333:14></a>

		Two great subjects, after our personal salvation, fill up Scripture -- the government of the world; and the church, the special fruit of sovereign grace.<a name=333:15></a> Prophecy treats of the former, and, as Paul -- who alone in the epistles speaks at all of the church or even names it<a href="#333:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> -- declares, never speaks at all of the church.<a name=333:16></a> It was a mystery hid in God, could not be revealed; for it was founded on the breaking down of the middle wall of partition, on the maintenance of which the Jewish system was founded.<a name=333:17></a>

		Now the true pre-millennial view is that God's purpose is to gather together all things in heaven and earth under one head, Christ.<a name=334:1></a> The church is the centre after Christ of the heavenly system, the Jews of the earthly.<a name=334:2></a> The church is caught up, when He comes, to take her place with Him there, as are all raised saints with her; and then He comes with them to establish peace and blessing on the earth.<a name=334:3></a> For the world (Greek -- the habitable earth) to come -- to come, mark, after Christianity was set up in the world -- is not subjected to angels, but to man.<a name=334:4></a> We have a heavenly place, nor does Christ give up His heavenly place because He takes the earth to bless it.<a name=334:5></a> He holds both under His power -- only His agents are glorified saints, who certainly appear with Him (Colossians 3), and to whom He has given His glory, that the world may know (not believe) that they are loved as He was, proving distinctly the existence of the heavenly visible glory of the saints while the world and men subsist -- not the angels, though these ever minister to His glory.<a name=334:6></a> Such is the express testimony of Scripture.<a name=334:7></a> See Psalm 8, Hebrews 2.<a name=334:8></a> He waits at the right hand of God till the time comes for Him to take His power and reign.<a name=334:9></a> Psalm 110 and Hebrews 10).<a name=334:10></a> Such is the statement of Scripture.<a name=334:11></a> (See Ephesians 1 and Colossians 1.<a name=334:12></a>)

		Now I agree with Dr.<a name=334:13></a> B.<a name=334:14></a> that this, while leaving orthodox foundations where they are, changes the whole nature and character of Christianity.<a name=334:15></a> Salvation remains the same, but all the thoughts and relationship of the saved are different.<a name=334:16></a> "Pre-millennialism is no barren speculation -- useless though true, and innocuous though false.<a name=334:17></a> It is a school of scripture interpretation; it impinges upon and affects some of the most commanding points of the Christian faith, and when suffered to work its unimpeded way, it stops not till it has pervaded with its own genius the entire system of one's theology, and the whole tone of his spiritual character, constructing, I had almost said, a world of its own; so that, holding the same faith and cherishing the same fundamental hopes as other Christians, he yet sees things through a medium of his own, and finds everything instinct with the life which this doctrine has generated within him," page 6.<a name=334:18></a><a href="#334:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> This is thoroughly true, and shews how necessary it is, in all grace and patience, to see where the truth lies.<a name=334:19></a> Above all, Christ's Person, and our

	<div class="paragraph">
		The post-millennial Christian may, nay must, love His appearing as an abstract idea; but it is no present hope: he looks to the gospel spreading and filling the whole earth (I do not say desires -- that abstractedly every saint would say Amen to), and thinks it must be so.<a name=335:3></a> He can therefore love the appearing though it has no practical reality for him, but he could not say "We which are alive and remain" (the remainers, the apostle putting himself in the class, without fixing a day) "unto the coming of the Lord.<a name=335:4></a>" He could not place himself in such a class at all.<a name=335:5></a> He could not seek to be kept without rebuke in service till the appearing, nor say of the dead, as Paul in Thessalonians 4, 'Weep not, he will be brought with Jesus when He appears, for, raised or changed, we are going to meet Him.<a name=335:6></a>' Such a comfort no saint thinks of now.<a name=335:7></a> A present hope it cannot be.<a name=335:8></a> It is not that he cannot morally love it (though the making the earth blessed by it he does not believe); but he must look for it across at least a thousand years, and hence (though not altogether with Dr.<a name=335:9></a> B.<a name=335:10></a>, yet even he speaks of a perfect analogy) we constantly see death take the place, as an equivalent, of the Lord's coming -- a thing unknown to Scripture, blessed as death is for the saint.<a name=335:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But this catching up of the saints to meet the Lord in the air and be for ever with Him, and His appearing, and the day of the Lord, are all confounded by these theologians.<a name=335:12></a> They all abide His appearing to be judged -- a senseless thing for those already centuries in heaven.<a name=335:13></a> Then Dr.<a name=335:14></a> B.<a name=335:15></a> says the Redeemer's second appearing is the very pole star of the church (page 14).<a name=335:16></a> It is not so at all.<a name=335:17></a> It is His coming to receive her to Himself, that where He is, she may be also.<a name=335:18></a> It is expressly revealed that when He appears, she will appear with Him.<a name=335:19></a> This mixture of hope with judgment leads him to quote its terror for sinners as a part of this hope.<a name=335:20></a> Now as no apostle speaks of the church, so no apostle speaks of its rapture, but Paul.<a name=335:21></a> He was minister of the church to complete the word of God.<a name=335:22></a> But he never confounds the appearing with the rapture.<a name=335:23></a> Joy of grace belongs to this last; all responsibility is referred to His appearing.<a name=335:24></a> The general thought of His coming runs through all as gladness

		and joy to saints.<a name=336:1></a> The class of texts which present a difficulty are those which speak in a general way of judgment But, as Dr.<a name=336:2></a> B.<a name=336:3></a> says, the church is seen as a whole from beginning to end.<a name=336:4></a> This is true: and not only so; often the principle of judgment, applied as it was to come on those then on the earth, as 2 Thessalonians 1, as the Lord says, "to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return" <a href="#336:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> (the whole space now of one thousand years being taken as no time because the principle only was in question); this goes yet farther.<a name=336:5></a> Judgment is spoken of morally without reference to time or circumstances.<a name=336:6></a> "He that confesseth me before men, him will I confess before the angels of God.<a name=336:7></a>" It does not speak of when.<a name=336:8></a> So judgment-day is used as characteristic, not as a point of time -- "more tolerable for Sodom in judgment-day than for that city.<a name=336:9></a>" It may be a point of time.<a name=336:10></a> In this case I suppose it will, but it is not the point which is before the Lord.<a name=336:11></a> The result of judgment is given, not the circumstances of it.<a name=336:12></a>

		Before treating of details, I would notice the way in which traditional theology obscures the truth and complicates men's thoughts as to it.<a name=336:13></a> Christ is spoken of in Scripture as Prophet, Priest, and King.<a name=336:14></a> Nothing can be simpler.<a name=336:15></a> But, having got hold of these three official positions, everything must come under them.<a name=336:16></a> Now these titles grow from Jewish analogies, and the full gospel light is dropped by this.<a name=336:17></a> He is King -- king to save, they say, to give life, and the like.<a name=336:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All this is unscriptural.<a name=336:19></a> He was the great Prophet on earth.<a name=336:20></a> He is Priest in heaven.<a name=336:21></a> He is in title, and will be in fact, King of Israel, and over the nations.<a name=336:22></a> Scripture never speaks of His being King of the church, nor of His saving in the spiritual sense of salvation as king.<a name=336:23></a> The whole system of thought is narrow, and, if Scripture be simply received, it is much simpler.<a name=336:24></a> He is Son of God, and gives life as such -- quickens whom He will.<a name=336:25></a> He has suffered as Son of man, and will be head over all things as such.<a name=336:26></a> He is Advocate with the Father.<a name=336:27></a> He is Head of the body, the church, His bride -- the firstborn, too, among many brethren.<a name=336:28></a> I only notice these as examples to point out the narrowness of the system and the far greater simplicity and richness of Scripture.<a name=336:29></a>

		question Dr.<a name=337:1></a> B.<a name=337:2></a> puts on this subject of judgment, which I take first as the only one having any difficulty for my reader, shews how tradition usurps the place of Scripture.<a name=337:3></a> He enquires (page 261), speaking of judging -- ruling and governing being admitted to be a scriptural sense of the word, "Are these the senses in which Christ will come to judge at the great day?<a name=337:4></a>" Now this is the traditional assumption that the great day of judgment -- the great white throne -- is the great day.<a name=337:5></a> Now the great day is never used in Scripture for this -- save in Jude as to the angels, which does not apply to the judgment of men at all -- but for a terrible day on the earth; for Jacob's trouble, Jeremiah 30: 7; the day of Jezreel, Hosea 1: 11; again, Joel 2: 11-31, quoted Acts 2: 20, shewing clearly it is on earth.<a name=337:6></a> Those who call on the name of the Lord are saved in it (Zephaniah 1: 14), where it is unquestionably on the earth; Malachi 4: 5, where smiting the earth is in question.<a name=337:7></a> Does the New Testament help us further?<a name=337:8></a> Jude 6: here we have the judgment of fallen angels, as to which we have no further light in Scripture.<a name=337:9></a> The expression is general.<a name=337:10></a> There is not the smallest hint that it is before the "great white throne"; but the contrary.<a name=337:11></a> The dead only appear there.<a name=337:12></a> As far as there is any intimation of scripture, it is not there; for we read (1 Corinthians 6) that we are to judge angels, so that the character of the judgment is quite different; nor is it a judgment of details of conscience.<a name=337:13></a> The devil, not necessarily included in Jude's words, is cast into the lake of fire, as an adversary, before the great white throne is set up.<a name=337:14></a> Revelation 6: 17, and 16: 14, both expressly speak of a terrible day on earth.<a name=337:15></a> To begin with, therefore, the great day is not a general day of judgment of the dead.<a name=337:16></a> That thought is the fruit of tradition, not of Scripture.<a name=337:17></a> The dead will surely be judged; but that is not called the great day in Scripture.<a name=337:18></a> The terrible time of God's judgment on earth is so called.<a name=337:19></a> The fallen angels are reserved for it; but we judge them.<a name=337:20></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to Revelation 21: 7, 8; chapter 22: 12-15, one is in the eternal state of the new heavens and new earth, and at that time Christ does not come at all.<a name=338:9></a> He had come at a preceding epoch, when the time of restoring grace was over, and the things which were shortly to come to pass had come to their climax.<a name=338:10></a> Nor does "every man" include necessarily the coming dispensation, though there is nothing at all in pre-millennial views to hinder anyone thinking so; for, according to these and Scripture, the judicial period, as Dr.<a name=338:11></a> B.<a name=338:12></a> says, is contrasted with this present time.<a name=338:13></a> Christ is to judge the quick and the dead at His appearing and His kingdom.<a name=338:14></a> This general application of judgment in contrast with the time of responsibility is universal in the Lord's teaching, where details are not gone into at all.<a name=338:15></a> There is a time of responsibility; another time when actions are weighed.<a name=338:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Here the quotation, however, is unfortunate; for it is closed by a reference to the transfiguration, which in every one of the three gospels follows these words, as in Mark 8: 38, and is declared by Peter to be an exhibition of the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=338:17></a> This is the Son of man coming in His kingdom, where we have the excellent glory of the Shechinah, into which the saints enter -- the Father's house -- the Lord and His saints displayed in glory on earth, and living saints witnesses of it.<a name=338:18></a> Hence we learn that when He speaks of rewarding every man according to his works, He refers specially to the coming in His kingdom, not to the final state, though surely the judgment will endure then.<a name=338:19></a>

		All own this happy state will end in a final rebellion when Satan is let loose.<a name=386:8></a> I believe there will be a decline, as I have said, but this is not Satan's being let loose.<a name=386:9></a> He did not deceive the nations then.<a name=386:10></a> He is let loose, and does it afterwards.<a name=386:11></a> Dr.<a name=386:12></a> B.<a name=386:13></a> tells us it cannot be an immediate change from piety to impiety -- from the hypocritical form of piety to impiety it is, so as to form a complete and definite separation of the good and the evil.<a name=386:14></a> They are deceived and gathered together to battle, and the saints crowded into their own camp.<a name=386:15></a> There is no description of a decay of love, nor cry of saints, nor failure of faith as to the Son of man's coming.<a name=386:16></a> He does not come at all.<a name=386:17></a> There is not a hint of it, but a plain description of His coming a thousand years before, after the marriage of the Lamb, which Dr.<a name=386:18></a> B.<a name=386:19></a> says is not His coming.<a name=386:20></a> Now fire comes down from heaven and destroys them; and then, without any coming, the great white throne is set up, and the dead judged.<a name=386:21></a>

		I have not the smallest doubt that he is the great agent of the formation of the Latin or ten-horned beast at present, and that his operations distinctly mark the rapid approach of the final scenes.<a name=387:1></a> Blessed be God!<a name=387:2></a> But firstly, I do not think that beast to be the Antichrist, but that a false Christ in Judea, who will minister to his power and deceive the nations, will be.<a name=387:3></a> Secondly, the saints will be caught up to meet the Lord in the air before Antichrist is revealed.<a name=387:4></a> And, thirdly, the computation of dates is all unfounded.<a name=387:5></a> There are general analogies, I have no doubt, as there have been many Antichrists who were not the Antichrist.<a name=387:6></a> But the precise computation of time begins again with Daniel's last week (or, more accurately, half-week), when the abomination of desolation is placed in the holy place, and then the computation is by literal days, God's short work on the earth.<a name=387:7></a> In a word, exact computations are by literal days, though general statements and analogies may be by years.<a name=387:8></a> It is to be feared England will be dragged into the vortex of the ten kingdoms: God knows.<a name=387:9></a>
