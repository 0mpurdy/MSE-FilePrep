		A FEW WORDS ON ELIJAH
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1 Kings 17-20
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These chapters set before us several important principles; and we see there pointed out several very different characters; we learn in them also the ways of God.<a name=1:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ahab and Jezebel appear on the scene; Elijah prophesies; Obadiah is seen and the seven thousand men of God mentioned in chapter 19: 18.<a name=1:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The character of Ahab is presented to us in chapter 16: 29-33.<a name=1:3></a> Ahab, Jezebel, and the four hundred and fifty prophets were at the head of the apostates of Israel, who at that time worshipped Baal.<a name=1:4></a> And Obadiah and the seven thousand were mixed up with the people (chapter 18); not that they served the idol, but they were friends of Ahab.<a name=1:5></a> As for Elijah, he was the friend of God, and, separated entirely from the apostasy, he was the only witness of the truth in the midst of all the evil.<a name=1:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us distinguish then these three different classes of persons: Ahab and Israel, apostates on one side; Elijah, on the other, the faithful servant of God and again, somewhat different, Obadiah and the seven thousand connected always with the evil.<a name=1:7></a> Now let us examine the different characters of these persons.<a name=1:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What were the circumstances of Elijah?<a name=1:9></a> This feeble and poor man had no force and strength save what he found in the Lord, his only support (chapter 17: 1-9).<a name=1:10></a> He was a man of faith and prayer; and, keeping before the Lord, he could boldly testify against the apostasy of Israel and announce the judgments of God.<a name=1:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is said to him (chapter 17: 3), "Get thee hence and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith that is before Jordan"; then in verse 5 we read that he obeyed this command.<a name=1:12></a> We see already then that Elijah had no power, but had faith in God and knew that all blessing is in obedience.<a name=1:13></a> Also from the moment that the word was addressed to him, he submitted to it and went to the brook Cherith where he learnt to depend on God.<a name=1:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ahab and all Israel were the enemies of Elijah (chapter 18: 10); but God was his friend, and in each step that he took in fidelity to the Lord he learnt the fidelity of the Lord to him.<a name=1:15></a> By this means he was more and more strengthened for the mission on which he was about to be employed (chapter 18: 1).<a name=1:16></a> God sent him to be with a poor widow who entertained him during the famine, after he was fed by the ravens at Cherith.<a name=1:17></a> During all the time that he was cared for by the ravens at the brook, and by the widow at Sarepta, he learnt to know the riches of the love and grace of God.<a name=1:18></a> It is there precisely that we learn to know ourselves also in all the circumstances in which we are placed by the Lord.<a name=1:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=2>[Page 2]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We see then in chapter 17 the simple and entire obedience of Elijah.<a name=2:1></a> Whether the Lord sent him to a brook to be fed by ravens; whether he was sent to a widow during the famine; whether he was sent before his real enemy Ahab (chapter 18), he made no objection, but counting on the Lord he did that which he was ordered.<a name=2:2></a> He was nevertheless a man subject to the same passions and to the same infirmities as ourselves (James 5: 17, 18); but he had much of that faith the power of which is infinite.<a name=2:3></a> By it he could say that there should be no rain, and there was none; by it he could raise the son of the widow, and overcome Ahab the king and the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal.<a name=2:4></a> These circumstances shew us clearly that Elijah was in the place where one is blessed, namely, in that of obedience.<a name=2:5></a> Men were his enemies; Ahab had sent everywhere persons to find him out: but the Lord was his refuge, and he had learnt to trust in Him.<a name=2:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us examine now what concerns Obadiah (chapter 18: 3, etc.<a name=2:7></a>).<a name=2:8></a> He feared the Lord greatly, but, spite of this, he was in the service of Ahab's house and did not bear testimony against its evil.<a name=2:9></a> He did not suffer the reproach of Christ.<a name=2:10></a> He was not like Elijah, pursued and chased from country to country.<a name=2:11></a> He did not know what it was to be fed by the ravens or the widow; that is to say, he lived little by faith, and knew little of the ways of God.<a name=2:12></a> He lived at his ease in the world.<a name=2:13></a> Ahab was his lord.<a name=2:14></a> But who was Elijah's?<a name=2:15></a> Jehovah.<a name=2:16></a> Compare chapter 18: 10 and 15.<a name=2:17></a> Oh what a difference!<a name=2:18></a> Obadiah knew the good things of the earth; Elijah, the good things of heaven.<a name=2:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us read now verses 7-11.<a name=2:20></a> All the thoughts of Obadiah were about his master, whom he dreaded; but all the thoughts of Elijah were centred on the Lord, his only Master.<a name=2:21></a> The superiority of his position to that of Obadiah is further indicated by this circumstance, that the latter fell on his face before Elijah when he met him (verse 7).<a name=2:22></a> And when Elijah tells him to go and announce to Ahab, Obadiah is all frightened.<a name=2:23></a> Yet Obadiah was a child of God; he had even hid the prophets; but he had no strength whatever to bear testimony to the Lord, because he was associated with evil.<a name=2:24></a> As to Elijah, he could say fearlessly to Ahab and to all the people, "If the Lord be God, follow him," verse 21.<a name=2:25></a> Whence did, therefore, this boldness and power come, as seen in Elijah, a poor and weak man, who had been straitened to this point, that he depended upon ravens and upon a widow for his food?<a name=2:26></a> From the fact that he stood aloof from the apostasy, that he lived by faith and had a single eye fixed upon his God.<a name=2:27></a> Oh how far better his position was than that of Obadiah!<a name=2:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=3>[Page 3]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is in these things an application for us to make to ourselves.<a name=3:1></a> Let us gather from them this lesson, that since the Lord is God, it is He whom we must serve, and that, in order to be faithful to Him, we have to separate ourselves from all the principles of the apostasy by which we are surrounded.<a name=3:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We know how Elijah triumphed over his enemies: there is therefore no need of repeating the issue of the scene on Carmel.<a name=3:3></a> But let us observe that, when Elijah prayed the Lord that He might give him the victory, what he asked was, that it might be known that the Lord was God (verse 37).<a name=3:4></a> All the desire of his heart consisted in these two things, that the Lord might be glorified, and that His people might know Him.<a name=3:5></a> There was not in him the least desire to lift himself up, to exalt himself; it mattered not to him if he was nothing, provided that God might be glorified and His people brought to know Him.<a name=3:6></a> Oh that the same desire may be in us, and that all thought of vainglory may be cast far, far away!<a name=3:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us now read chapter 19.<a name=3:8></a> Poor Elijah!<a name=3:9></a> he had a lesson to learn, which we ourselves, weak and poor as we are, need to learn also.<a name=3:10></a> When Elijah stood before the Lord, he could by the Lord's power stop or send rain to the earth, raise up the widow's son, etc.<a name=3:11></a> But when he stood, not now before the Lord, but before Jezebel, he was then without strength, and this ungodly woman was able to cause him to fear.<a name=3:12></a> Downcast, Elijah therefore goes into the wilderness, sits down under a juniper-tree and asks the Lord to take away his life (verse 4).<a name=3:13></a> How different he is here from what he was in the chapter before!<a name=3:14></a> How little did he remember what the Lord had done for him; how little did he enter into the mind of God, and expect that chariot of fire which would shortly take him up to heaven!<a name=3:15></a> (2 Kings 2: 11).<a name=3:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So is it with us.<a name=3:17></a> We are downcast, discouraged and weak in ourselves as soon as we fail to live in faith and prayer, and then we cannot say, as Elijah in chapter 18, "The Lord before whom I stand.<a name=3:18></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 17 Elijah by faith could make the widow's oil and meal last; but here he is weak, and needs that an angel come to strengthen him and give him some food.<a name=4:1></a> (Read chapter 19: 5-8.<a name=4:2></a>) He eats, drinks, and like a man without strength lies down.<a name=4:3></a> But the Lord sends the angel back again, for He is plentiful in grace and mercy; He watches over all our ways and feeds our souls according to a our wants and according to all our circumstances.<a name=4:4></a> The Lord therefore bore with Elijah and succoured him, and it is also what He is with respect to us.<a name=4:5></a> As He was afflicted in all the affliction of His people (Isaiah 63: 9), so is He with us in ours now.<a name=4:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 17 God was leading Elijah and telling him where to go, and Elijah obeyed.<a name=4:7></a> But in chapter 19 Elijah, fearing Jezebel, flees away and does not wait for the Lord's commandment to go into the wilderness.<a name=4:8></a> See therefore what a sad message is sent to him, as recorded in verse 13, "What doest thou here, Elijah?<a name=4:9></a>" In verses 11 and 12 we read that a wind, an earthquake, and a fire are sent; but Elijah did not find.<a name=4:10></a> the Lord in these things, and they could not bring comfort nor strength to his soul.<a name=4:11></a> God was appearing in His grandeur and power; but what Elijah needed was the still small voice, what he wanted was the manifestation of grace and communion with his God.<a name=4:12></a> When, therefore, Elijah had heard the still small voice, he wrapped his face in his mantle and stood ready to obey the Lord.<a name=4:13></a> By the power and strength that he had found in this voice he was once again enabled to obey the commandment of the Lord.<a name=4:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What we have said on these chapters is very incomplete but we believe that the chief thing is to bring out of them the principles calculated to give the intelligence of what the chapters contain.<a name=4:15></a> Let us therefore be mindful of avoiding the position of Obadiah and the seven thousand, who were taking their ease in the midst of apostasy, but who were without strength to bear testimony against evil.<a name=4:16></a> Let us also remember that, though Elijah was despised and rejected of men, he was nevertheless in the place of blessing.<a name=4:17></a> And if like himself we are brought to realise our weakness, let us remember that communion with the Lord can alone give us afresh zeal and devotedness and joy.<a name=4:18></a>

		BRIEF THOUGHTS ON 1 CHRONICLES -- CHAPTERS 11-17
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a great difference between the David of Chronicles and that of Samuel.<a name=5:1></a> The king in 1 Chronicles is the David of grace and blessing according to the counsels of God.<a name=5:2></a> The king in Samuel is the historical David exercised in responsibility.<a name=5:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Chronicles we do not find the matter of Uriah nor that of Absalom.<a name=5:4></a> Even Joab with all his crimes, who is not cited in 2 Samuel 23, is here mentioned because he took the stronghold of Zion.<a name=5:5></a> This makes us understand what value Zion has in the eyes of God, and in what way the Chronicles regard the history.<a name=5:6></a> There is absolutely no evil reported, save that which is necessary to make us understand the history.<a name=5:7></a> In the book of Kings it is the history of Israel and the conduct of the kings under responsibility.<a name=5:8></a> In the books of Chronicles it is a question of God's mind, and in chapters 11 to 17 of the first book as to placing David in Jerusalem, chapter 10 having given us the fall of Saul.<a name=5:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		CHAPTER 11
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		David begins to reign over all Israel with the desires of the people; he begins at Zion.<a name=5:10></a> Afterward we have his valiant men, and their joy at installing him as king.<a name=5:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		CHAPTER 12
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here we see the heart of Israel returning to David, as it will return to Christ when He shall have established the throne in Zion.<a name=5:12></a> It is the heart of Israel which concentrates itself round the Beloved of God.<a name=5:13></a> Certain persons came when he was a stranger; now it is all Israel.<a name=5:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		CHAPTER 13
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then it is a question of putting the ark of God in its place.<a name=5:15></a> Before this the ark had been taken.<a name=5:16></a> (See Psalm 78: 59-72.<a name=5:17></a>) It is sovereign grace which returns.<a name=5:18></a> He chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which He loved.<a name=5:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1st.<a name=5:20></a> God was wroth and greatly abhorred Israel, so that He forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, and delivered His strength into captivity, and His glory into the enemy's hand.<a name=5:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2nd.<a name=5:22></a> With David God takes up His people and sanctuary.<a name=5:23></a> David re-commences all the history of Israel.<a name=5:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=6>[Page 6]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, if Psalm 132 be looked at, this feature will be seen as to the ark: it was the sign of the covenant finally, and a new thing to be set in Zion.<a name=6:1></a> When Moses in Numbers 10 said, "Rise up, LORD," he did not add "into thy rest.<a name=6:2></a>" The tabernacle in the wilderness could not be the rest of God.<a name=6:3></a> But Zion is the place that Jehovah chose for His rest.<a name=6:4></a> He desired it for His habitation (verse 13).<a name=6:5></a> And David enters into the mind of God.<a name=6:6></a> Compare verse 4.<a name=6:7></a> ("I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids, until," etc.<a name=6:8></a>) We see in the Psalms generally all the deep feelings in the heart of David for God.<a name=6:9></a> On the other hand God makes Himself respected, as we see in His dealing with Uzza.<a name=6:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have thus as a summary of all this: first, that God had rejected His tabernacle, Shiloh; and, secondly, that meanwhile He gives prophets to sustain sovereign relations with His people till Messiah comes.<a name=6:11></a> Samuel had truly begun prophecy, which is not anything established, but only serves meanwhile.<a name=6:12></a> See the song of Hannah who figures the remnant there.<a name=6:13></a> Prophecy declares that God is all, come what may, and that He sustains all things till He have raised the house of His anointed.<a name=6:14></a> Thirdly, at last in His anointed He accomplishes His mind.<a name=6:15></a> The people no more wished to have God working by prophecy than when He wrought by priesthood.<a name=6:16></a> They demand a king, and God gives Saul.<a name=6:17></a> Meanwhile God prepares His anointed by affliction.<a name=6:18></a> Hebrews 2 is just the counterpart of David's history.<a name=6:19></a> So, too, Jesus will reign over Judah before reigning over all Israel.<a name=6:20></a> In the Chronicles we have no history of David's reign in Hebron.<a name=6:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		CHAPTER 14
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		David king over all Israel renders himself terrible to the nations (verse 17), as the Lord will in due time (Zechariah 9; Micah 5).<a name=6:22></a> Victory follows dependence and obedience; and as the blessing of Jehovah comes, the fame of David goes out everywhere.<a name=6:23></a> Psalm 18 finds its place here: in taking it all, one must place it a little later.<a name=6:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		CHAPTER 15
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		David now has no rest till he has prepared a resting-place for the ark of Jehovah; even as the Lord also, in the midst of conflicts, will have no rest till He establishes the tie between God and His people.<a name=6:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=7>[Page 7]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Knowing that the tabernacle was abandoned, David did not dream of putting the ark in the tabernacle.<a name=7:1></a> This would have been to restore things on the spoilt footing of the law.<a name=7:2></a> The external routine had quite fallen short of God's glory.<a name=7:3></a> The king takes the lead, as priesthood had failed; and the ark is put in the seat of kingly power; as Christ the deliverer in grace will order all by-and-by in Zion, whence the rod of His power is to go forth.<a name=7:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then (verse 16) David institutes choral worship or psalmody: Heman, Asaph, and even David himself in an ephod of linen danced and played.<a name=7:5></a> It was he that recalled the due place of the Levites, and summoned the priests in their due order, who also had the singers appointed with instruments of music, psalteries, and harps, and cymbals sounding by lifting up the voice with joy.<a name=7:6></a> All is new here and in relation to David's mind touching Zion, the centre chosen, after having left aside the tabernacle at Gibeon and all the order established primitively by Moses.<a name=7:7></a> "So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of the house of Obed-edom with joy.<a name=7:8></a> And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams.<a name=7:9></a> And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: David also had upon him an ephod of linen.<a name=7:10></a> Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah with shouting, and with the sound of the cornet and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps, And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing; and she despised him in her heart," verse 25-29.<a name=7:11></a> Nevertheless David was not king and priest like Solomon, though it be true that his faith made all the joy of the people of God.<a name=7:12></a> It is a sort of anticipation of the true Melchizedek.<a name=7:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		CHAPTER 16
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This song is composed of several Psalms.<a name=7:14></a> We find here all the principles on which God founds the blessing of His people for the last day.<a name=7:15></a> But there is a remarkable difference -- that He does not put them in the definitive blessing.<a name=7:16></a> There is, to begin, a part of Psalm 105.<a name=7:17></a> He shews how He kept Abraham.<a name=7:18></a> He recalls the faithfulness of God toward them until then and bids them recollect it.<a name=7:19></a> Only He bids Israel be mindful always of His covenant without saying yet that He remembers it, because it is not yet the full blessing.<a name=7:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=8>[Page 8]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		From verse 23 we have Psalm 96.<a name=8:1></a> It is always an invitation.<a name=8:2></a> It is not yet Psalm 98 where all is accomplished.<a name=8:3></a> The temple is wanting.<a name=8:4></a> From verse 34 we have the beginning of the Psalms which celebrate the faithfulness of God, 106, 107, 118, and 136.<a name=8:5></a> Psalm 106 is His goodness, faithful for ever, in presence of all the unfaithfulness of Israel.<a name=8:6></a> Psalm 107 is that which He has done to gather at the last day.<a name=8:7></a> Psalm 98 is the celebration of the Messiah come back.<a name=8:8></a> It is the psalm in which it is said that the stone rejected by the builders is become the head of the corner.<a name=8:9></a> Psalm 136 is the celebration of God's goodness which begins from the creation, and goes through to the millennium.<a name=8:10></a> In this psalm mercy occupies the place from one end to the other.<a name=8:11></a> After this (in verses 35, 36) he cites still the end of Psalm 106.<a name=8:12></a> One sees by verse 35 that at this moment, as in Psalm 106, all Israel is not yet brought back and everything not yet restored.<a name=8:13></a> Only the pledge of the covenant is there.<a name=8:14></a> All the scene of the re-commencement of the relations of God with Israel is found in the Chronicles.<a name=8:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In verses 39-43 the altar was still with the tabernacle at Gibeon.<a name=8:16></a> It was a high place which one had to condemn in following David who had the fresh truth.<a name=8:17></a> Faith did so, though Solomon did not, but clung to the altar.<a name=8:18></a> However, David with the priests to offer burnt-offerings established Heman and Jeduthun, etc.<a name=8:19></a>, to give thanks to Jehovah because His mercy endures for ever.<a name=8:20></a> It is thus that one can judge what is old system in the church; though we can also say, His mercy endures for ever.<a name=8:21></a> The altar there was a testimony to the fallen state of the people, for the ark was not in the tabernacle.<a name=8:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is touching to see that the Chronicles were written in the time of Ezra and Nehemiah.<a name=8:23></a> At that time it was less necessary to tell all the sins of the people than to say, His mercy endures for ever.<a name=8:24></a> A basis is laid for all in Christ's death, and by His resurrection all are sure mercies to be displayed at His coming and kingdom.<a name=8:25></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Here the condition laid upon the seed of David is not found as in 2 Samuel 7.<a name=9:1></a> God did not allow David to build the temple; because, when He would glorify Himself in the midst of the people, it was necessary that it should be in peace and that there be no more enemies.<a name=9:2></a> The warrior was the character of David, though at that moment there was rest all around.<a name=9:3></a> Because of that David could not build the house of Jehovah.<a name=9:4></a> Nevertheless as depositary of promises he learns that Jehovah will build him a house (verse 10), and that his son should build Jehovah a house, as He would establish David's house for evermore (verse 12-14).<a name=9:5></a> How touching is the prayer of David on this occasion!<a name=9:6></a> (verse 16-27).<a name=9:7></a>

		NOTES ON 1 CHRONICLES 13-17
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God is graciously pleased to reveal Himself in different ways and at different times.<a name=10:1></a> He formerly made Himself known by prophets, but in these last times He has manifested Himself in His Son; and in whatever way He has chosen to reveal Himself, He has been rejected in them all.<a name=10:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		For instance, the ark was the sign of the presence of Jehovah in the midst of His people.<a name=10:3></a> Well, the ark was abandoned (1 Samuel 7: 2); just as today the Holy Spirit, by which God is in the midst of His people, is despised.<a name=10:4></a> God was then present by the ark as He is today by the Holy Ghost, and as He was rejected by the abandonment of the ark, He is rejected today in as far as the Spirit is not honoured.<a name=10:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But although the people might thus have forgotten and despised Jehovah, David could have no joy nor rest until the ark was brought back, and the presence of the Lord recognised.<a name=10:6></a> He knew that peace and blessing are only to be had where God is, and longed ardently for His presence.<a name=10:7></a> We have the cry of David's soul in Psalm 63.<a name=10:8></a> "And let us bring again the ark of our God to us; for we inquired not at it in the days of Saul," 1 Chronicles 13: 3.<a name=10:9></a>

		The king's great occupation was to seek how he could accomplish that which he had in his heart; and we see in verses 1 and 4 that he consulted all the people, and that they agreed to his proposal.<a name=10:10></a> But although it was a holy desire in David and in Israel for the return of the ark, it ought only to have been accomplished according to the will of God, who alone could teach them how they ought to set about it in order that His name might be glorified.<a name=10:11></a> But David's having consulted the people, instead of consulting the Lord, caused the ark of God to be brought upon a new cart from the house of Abinadab, "and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart," verse 7.<a name=10:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All this was bad, for it was against the commandment of the Lord, and God could neither recognise nor bless this act.<a name=10:13></a> He had said that the ark ought to be borne by the children of Kohath, that is to say, by the Levites (Numbers 4: 15); and if David had consulted the Lord, he would have been taught about this, and the ark would have been neither placed on a cart nor conducted by Uzza and Ahio.<a name=10:14></a> But David took counsel with the people and they executed their holy desire according to their own thoughts, and not according to God's.<a name=10:15></a> Uzza acted also on the same principle; he was not led by the Lord to hold the ark, but by his own judgment.<a name=10:16></a> He was not a man who felt his weakness and who allowed himself to be ruled and guided by the Lord; and consequently he put forth his hand and touched the ark.<a name=10:17></a> Thus every child of God who puts his hand to the Lord's work, presuming that he is able to act in his own strength, resembles Uzza.<a name=10:18></a> It is God alone who is to be glorified, and it is He alone who can say how He wishes to be glorified; and if David had inquired of Him, he would have learnt that God would glorify Himself.<a name=10:19></a>

		We see in verse 10 what were the sad consequences of Uzza's conduct, and in verse 11 we see that David was greatly afflicted at the breach the Lord made upon Uzza; but it was needful for him in this way to learn, that we have to wait and let the Lord do His work in His own way.<a name=11:1></a> May we also keep this instruction, of which we all have need, and not act in our own strength!<a name=11:2></a> Let us remember that Uzza drew upon himself the wrath of God by putting his hand to the ark.<a name=11:3></a> All the work was spoilt by his folly: the ark instead of being brought in triumph was put aside and placed in the house of Obed-edom; and all this because in the first place David had not consulted the Lord, and secondly Uzza acted himself instead of letting the Lord act.<a name=11:4></a> These circumstances were calculated to humble David greatly: he was first afflicted, then afraid of God (verse 11, 12); but all that happened taught him wherein he had failed.<a name=11:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we see in the following chapter (14) that he acted very differently.<a name=11:6></a> The Philistines having spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim (verse 9), did David assemble all his army and prepare immediately for battle?<a name=11:7></a> No, he consulted God, saying, "Shall I shew myself against the Philistines, and wilt thou deliver them into my hand?<a name=11:8></a>" Now it is no more the people that David consults, it is the Lord; thus the consequence is very different from that of the first circumstance.<a name=11:9></a> In chapter 13: 11 the breach is made in the midst of David's people; but here it is made in the midst of his enemies, for God acts for him (chapter 14: 11).<a name=11:10></a>

		We may be very zealous for the glory of God; but the greater our zeal is, the more harm it will do if it is not according to knowledge; we shall spoil everything, like David in chapter 13, if we do not understand our incapacity and dependence; and we can only acquire the knowledge that we need, in order that our zeal be not destructive, by consulting the Lord.<a name=11:11></a>

		A remarkable thing is, that trials and chastisement are always needed to bring us back to God's order: it was in the midst of much affliction that David learned God's intention, and these afflictions served to make the lesson he had received penetrate deeply into his soul.<a name=12:1></a> In chapter 14: 13, 14, we see that, the Philistines having again returned, David again consults the Lord.<a name=12:2></a> This time the Lord does not tell David to go up to the Philistines and that he will have the victory, for God wished to prove him still more.<a name=12:3></a> God told him not to go up to his enemies, but to wait for a noise in the tops of the mulberry-trees.<a name=12:4></a> What had the mulberry-trees to do with the battle?<a name=12:5></a> Nothing, but God wanted to be recognised: this was the lesson that David further learnt.<a name=12:6></a> He obeyed the Lord; and we see the consequence was, that the Lord was glorified and David's reputation spread abroad.<a name=12:7></a> David having owned the Lord, the Lord could everywhere own David.<a name=12:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What magnificent instruction is found in these chapters?<a name=12:9></a> May we keep it and be led by it every day in order that God may be glorified in us.<a name=12:10></a> Let us remember to leave God to do His own work, and if He wish to use us for something, what we have to do is to consult Him about it, and not so-and-so.<a name=12:11></a> Thus, instead of putting obstacles in the way of His work, we shall be blessed in that which He will do through us.<a name=12:12></a>

		In chapter 15: 2 David says, "None ought to carry the ark of the Lord but the Levites.<a name=12:13></a>" He remembers his fall, and the lesson is learned; he applies himself now to act according to God's intention.<a name=12:14></a> Thus we see, the work of man no longer spoils that of God, and God is glorified, the people are joyful, the ark of the Lord has again taken its place in their midst, and the blessing is so great that the psalms which they sing are those which will be sung in the millennium, when the Lord will return to Israel (verse 25-29).<a name=12:15></a> In chapter 16: 8-22 they sing Psalm 105 and from verses 23 to 33 they sing Psalm 96.<a name=12:16></a> How different are the results which we find in chapter 13, where David acts by himself without consulting the Lord, and he and all his people are plunged into affliction!<a name=12:17></a> But, here, where it is God who acts, the blessing is so great that David and all his people call on the heavens and earth to rejoice at it.<a name=12:18></a>

		In chapter 17 we again see a holy desire in David: he wished to build a house for the ark, but was this the will of God?<a name=13:1></a> Nathan told David to do all that was in his heart (verse 2).<a name=13:2></a> Ah, Nathan had not learned the lesson, for he answered without learning from Jehovah His intention, and in the same night God charged him to go and tell David, "Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in.<a name=13:3></a>" David wished to give something to Jehovah, but Jehovah was going to give to him.<a name=13:4></a> David wanted to build a house for Jehovah, but Jehovah was going to build one for David (verse 10).<a name=13:5></a> "For it is more blessed to give than to receive," Acts 20: 35, and giving is God's part.<a name=13:6></a> This is another lesson that David learnt.<a name=13:7></a> The Lord does not need us to bless Him, but He is pleased to bless us: what He asks of us is to sit at Jesus' feet and receive the abundant grace He bestows on us.<a name=13:8></a> From verse 16 to 21 one sees that David has understood this lesson; his thoughts are no more, as at the beginning of the chapter, occupied with the construction of a house, but with God Himself (verse 20); and he is humble and grateful before Jehovah.<a name=13:9></a> All that he says in these verses shews that he has learnt of God he thinks n more of himself, nor his zeal, nor his projects, he has forgotten all that is of himself in thinking of Jehovah.<a name=13:10></a> Oh let us imitate David in this!<a name=13:11></a> May our thoughts centre in God and we shall no longer be occupied with ourselves, nor with what we wish to do (verse 5, 6-8).<a name=13:12></a>

		NOTES ON 2 CHRONICLES 18-20
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have seen in 1 Kings 17, 18, that Ahab and Jezebel worshipped the idol Baal, and now we read the judgments of God on Ahab and apostate Israel.<a name=14:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is necessary for us to know the circumstances mentioned in this chapter, as they are of grave importance.<a name=14:2></a> Let us consider in it especially the characters of Jehoshaphat and Micaiah.<a name=14:3></a> This last was separated from Ahab and apostate Israel; he entered into God's thoughts and was declaring to Ahab and Israel the judgments which were ready to come upon them.<a name=14:4></a> Read verses 16-23.<a name=14:5></a> In verse 26 we see the consequences of his fidelity: Ahab and Israel are his enemies, and he is put into the place of affliction.<a name=14:6></a> Jehoshaphat's circumstances were very different; he was a child of God as well as Micaiah, but he was rich and great, and had made alliance with one of God's enemies -- with Ahab.<a name=14:7></a> Ahab knew him to be a child of God, and, in order to tranquillise his conscience, caused sheep and oxen to be killed for him in abundance.<a name=14:8></a> It mattered not to Ahab what he did if he succeeded in persuading Jehoshaphat to go with him to Ramoth-Gilead.<a name=14:9></a> But Jehoshaphat's conscience was not satisfied by the sacrifice of all these sheep and oxen; and he said to the king of Israel, "Inquire, I pray thee at the word of Jehovah today.<a name=14:10></a>" Ahab then assembled the four hundred and fifty prophets who cried, "Peace, peace," although God's judgment was ready to break over him and apostate Israel; but the words of these false prophets did not satisfy Jehoshaphat's conscience any more than the sacrifices.<a name=14:11></a> Thus it is ever so when the child of God is found in the midst of evil of any kind: although four hundred and fifty prophets and the whole world would seek to satisfy his conscience, they could not attain this end.<a name=14:12></a> See what is said of false prophets in Ezekiel 13: 1-16.<a name=14:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the king of Israel was satisfied with what the lying prophets said; and, as God punished Pharaoh by giving him up to a delusion, He did the same to Ahab.<a name=14:14></a> And the same thing will happen to many others at the end of this dispensation; men will preach "peace, peace," and judgment will break forth upon them (Revelation 16: 14; 2 Thessalonians 2: 7-13).<a name=14:15></a> Here is a solemn truth.<a name=14:16></a> This is why we ought first to be very grateful because the Lord has revealed Himself to us; then we ought to take care not to become like Jehoshaphat who "joined affinity with Ahab.<a name=14:17></a>" How good the Lord was to put it into the king of Judah's heart to seek counsel of a prophet of Jehovah!<a name=14:18></a> It was a means by which he might have been instructed about the judgments which were going to happen, and have been able to warn his people.<a name=14:19></a> But alliance with evil blinds to such a degree, that Jehoshaphat did not discern that Micaiah was a true prophet of Jehovah; and he did not believe his word, but went in spite of it all up to the battle in which Ahab was to meet with the judgment of God.<a name=14:20></a> Oh may we be separated from evil in order to be capable of judging all things and to hold fast that which is truth!<a name=14:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=15>[Page 15]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have also to remark Micaiah's faithfulness: although he was engaged by the messenger to speak the same words as the false prophets, he replied, "What my God saith, that will I speak," verse 12, 13.<a name=15:1></a> Micaiah told Ahab that he should be killed in the battle; but the latter, thinking to escape by his own prudence, disguised himself, and told Jehoshaphat to wear his robes (verse 27-30).<a name=15:2></a> Oh what a magnificent proof we have of the love of God in these verses!<a name=15:3></a> Jehoshaphat is surrounded by the Syrians on all sides, but he was a child of God; and although he had joined with Ahab, nothing could separate him from the Lord whose faithfulness to His own endures notwithstanding their unfaithfulness.<a name=15:4></a> Jehoshaphat cried to the Lord who became his protector; and although, humanly speaking, it seemed all over with him, nevertheless his enemies were not allowed to touch him.<a name=15:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But as surely as the child of God will be preserved by the love of his Father, so sure is it that the judgment of God will fall on those who reject His mercy.<a name=15:6></a> We see this in a remarkable manner in this chapter.<a name=15:7></a> Ahab, notwithstanding His precautions, could not escape; he might have disguised himself from the Syrians, but he was not able to hide himself from God (verse 33).<a name=15:8></a> Thus it is with poor sinners: even if they should succeed in not being seen by man, the eye of God will find them.<a name=15:9></a> May the Lord make this example of use to us!<a name=15:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is well to consider how much more advantageous Micaiah's position was than that of Jehoshaphat.<a name=15:11></a> It is true he was afflicted and persecuted by Ahab and the false prophets, but he was not like Jehoshaphat to be found in the midst of God's judgments.<a name=15:12></a> The latter was as ignorant as Ahab of what was going to take place; be it that even Micaiah had announced it to them, and that these judgments were, as it were, suspended over their heads, yet Jehoshaphat did not expect them.<a name=15:13></a> And why?<a name=15:14></a> For he was a child of God as well as Micaiah.<a name=15:15></a> Had he.<a name=15:16></a> not the Lord's thought and a clear view of His intention?<a name=15:17></a> It was because he had joined himself to God's enemies and that his affections were with the things of the world, whilst Micaiah had separated himself to the service of God.<a name=15:18></a> Oh how ashamed Jehoshaphat ought to have been, to be thus found amongst the Lord's enemies!<a name=15:19></a> and how grateful he ought to have been for the gracious help which he so little merited!<a name=15:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	<div class="paragraph">
		We see in chapter 19: 2, that, although Jehoshaphat had been delivered by the compassion and love of God, he was spoken to in words of reproach, after which the Lord encouraged him by adding, "Nevertheless there are good things found in thee"; which shews us, that if God disapprove that which is evil, He owns the good which He has put into His own people.<a name=16:1></a> In Jude's Epistle, which speaks of the apostasy of the present dispensation, we see at verse 23 something similar to that which happened to Jehoshaphat.<a name=16:2></a> Like Lot, he was saved so as by fire.<a name=16:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		All these circumstances in Jehoshaphat's life were calculated to humble him deeply and teach him the incomprehensible fulness of God's mercy.<a name=16:4></a> He ought to have drawn from these experiences deep instruction both about God and himself.<a name=16:5></a> Let us read in 2 Chronicles 20: 2-13 what were the fruits of these instructions.<a name=16:6></a> Jehoshaphat is here very different; he is not now in affinity with Ahab, he is depending on God alone in whom is his strength and his joy.<a name=16:7></a> "Our eyes are on thee," he says to Jehovah.<a name=16:8></a> Will Micaiah be now separated from him as he was in the preceding chapter?<a name=16:9></a> Let us read from verse 15 to 18 of chapter 20.<a name=16:10></a> In the preceding chapter Jehoshaphat is found in the ranks of God's enemies, and he is only saved by the intervention of Jehovah; but here we see him dependent upon God and blessed, not afraid, and knowing that Jehovah is with him.<a name=16:11></a> He goes to the battle, and God orders it all in such a way that he has no anxiety (verse 17).<a name=16:12></a> What a precious lesson he had received in all this!<a name=16:13></a> And should we not be disposed to think that from this time forth he would keep near to God and in separation from His enemies?<a name=16:14></a> He had learnt by experience the grief there is in sin, and it seems impossible that he should fall again into the same fault which had brought him into such trouble; but we see in verses 35-38 that it was not so.<a name=16:15></a><a name=17>[Page 17]</a>

		It just teaches us how good is to be got, how blessing comes and must come, that is, in the real knowledge of self Men speak of God's goodness; but their only thought of God's goodness is His passing over sin.<a name=22:2></a> Were half the people around us put into heaven, they would get out as fast as they could.<a name=22:3></a> What is in heaven is not in accordance with them: nothing they like is there, and nothing is there that they like.<a name=22:4></a> Not one of us naturally would find a single thing according to our mind in heaven.<a name=22:5></a> So that the Lord says, "Ye must be born again.<a name=22:6></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The goodness of God does not pass over iniquity, but brings us to the distinct definite knowledge of what we are and of what we have done.<a name=22:7></a> Hence being good, He is above all the evil and can bless us in Christ.<a name=22:8></a> Here we are walking in a vain show, and are aware that everything around will not last.<a name=22:9></a> Everybody knows that the fashion of this world passes away, and yet people are occupied with it.<a name=22:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"While we look not at the things that are seen, but at the things which are not seen.<a name=22:11></a>" What is "seen," everybody knows, will all go to nothing.<a name=22:12></a> They must leave it any way (1 Timothy 6); and then their whole life and objects will be entirely done with.<a name=22:13></a> Their conduct they will not have done with, unless it be put away by the blood of Christ.<a name=22:14></a> You think God has given a revelation; but do we want a revelation of this world?<a name=22:15></a> According to our intelligence and ability we know the world ourselves; but when we pass beyond this world, we want God to tell us, to bring down to us, a sure and certain testimony of what will become of us.<a name=22:16></a> This He has done.<a name=22:17></a> He has given a full revelation of what our state is and what His holiness is; and He has given a sure, settled and certain foundation for blessing so that there can be no doubt about it.<a name=22:18></a>

		God would not have us walking in uncertainty; for uncertainty is misery.<a name=22:19></a> "We have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but the Spirit of adoption whereby we cry, Abba, Father.<a name=22:20></a>" Believing in Jesus we know our relationship with God, we are "joint-heirs with Christ.<a name=22:21></a>" "Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.<a name=22:22></a>" God was dealing with Job; but he had to learn himself.<a name=22:23></a> What makes Job so interesting is that the book comes before all dispensations.<a name=22:24></a>

		Supposing God had stopped there, what would have come of it?<a name=23:6></a> Job might have said, "In prosperity I was eyes to the blind; in adversity I was patient": and the whole case would have been worse.<a name=23:7></a> He goes on till his friends come, and then, perhaps from pride, or because he could not bear their sympathy, he breaks down.<a name=23:8></a> The process was a trying humbling one.<a name=23:9></a> "Oh if I could meet God," Job says, "He is not like you: there is goodness in Him.<a name=23:10></a>" His friends stood on utterly false ground; they took this world as the adequate witness of the government of God.<a name=23:11></a> This only makes Job the more angry: the world is no adequate testimony of the government of God.<a name=23:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There you see a soul rising under that which is upon him, striving and wrestling, the flesh breaking out so that he should know himself Job, having been thus wrought in and exercised and ploughed up, passes through all the various considerations as to how he could meet God.<a name=23:13></a> Throughout there are certain true sayings, as "The righteous Lord loveth righteousness"; but are we righteous?<a name=23:14></a> This is another story.<a name=23:15></a> Are you in a condition, if you had to do with God this moment, to say "I am righteous" before Him?<a name=23:16></a> Many a one looks at the cross and says "I am a poor sinner, and I have no hope but the cross.<a name=23:17></a>" But can you say, "I am a poor sinner, and the judgment-seat just suits me"?<a name=23:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		When we have really known Christ as our righteousness, there is no place where the soul is so clear and bright and certain about the matter as for the day of judgment: we shall be in glory then.<a name=23:19></a> Where the heart has not been broken up, the soul does not understand as a present thing what it is to be before God now.<a name=23:20></a> You will find in this chapter naughty expressions, but in the main what Job says is true.<a name=23:21></a> There was a mixture, that his wrong thoughts might be judged.<a name=23:22></a>

		"How should man be just with God?<a name=24:1></a>" The instant the soul is awakened, it sees with God's eye: and this is the only way of seeing right.<a name=24:2></a> When this is the case, the soul in the light of the judgment of God says, "I could not answer him one of a thousand.<a name=24:3></a>" God is infinitely good; but His way of goodness is not that of allowing evil.<a name=24:4></a> Could you answer for yourself in the day of judgment for everything you have ever said or done?<a name=24:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We were all living in a vain show.<a name=24:6></a> I may have a character, which God cares nothing about; but He cares about conscience.<a name=24:7></a> Before the day of judgment He says "There is none righteous, no, not one," "that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.<a name=24:8></a>" Job goes through several of these cases; then his wrong feeling breaks out.<a name=24:9></a> "He .<a name=24:10></a>.<a name=24:11></a>.<a name=24:12></a> filleth me with bitterness.<a name=24:13></a>" Then he gets more right, "If I justify myself, my own mouth shall condemn me.<a name=24:14></a>" Can you justify yourself in God's presence?<a name=24:15></a> If you cannot justify yourself there, what is the good of doing so anywhere else?<a name=24:16></a> You could not stand in the light as God is in the light, and you know it.<a name=24:17></a> How comes it that the thought of God makes a man melancholy?<a name=24:18></a> He finds out that he is not walking with God.<a name=24:19></a> Then, it is impossible to go on longer in that way: we all naturally have got a conscience of good and evil.<a name=24:20></a> The crust of the heart has to be ploughed up -- the "fallow ground," as Jeremiah calls it.<a name=24:21></a>

		Then comes another case: "If I wash myself with snow water and make my hands never so clean, yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me.<a name=24:22></a>" Thus, if a man had been brought up in a dirty cabin, he does not feel it to be so.<a name=24:23></a> Thus men have habits of thinking according to men, not according to God.<a name=24:24></a> You will find that sins against man are thought a great deal of, such as murder and robbery: suppose a man commits sins like these, he is intolerable, not fit for society; but suppose he hates God, men say, Oh, that is his own affair.<a name=24:25></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The law does not give life, it does not take away sins, nor does it give an object for the heart.<a name=25:13></a> The man in Romans 7 says, "I hate sin.<a name=25:14></a>" "So do I," says the law, "and this is the reason that I curse you.<a name=25:15></a>" Does this inspire confidence?<a name=25:16></a> The law is very useful, it brings the knowledge of sin -- what Job was getting here, not that it was law but the same principle).<a name=25:17></a> There was no peace, no rest, but it was sin brought upon the conscience, which never gave confidence.<a name=25:18></a>

		In Cain we see utter insensibility to man's having been driven out of paradise, to sin, to the curse: he brought to God the very sign of the curse.<a name=25:19></a> Cain left God and listened to Satan; therefore he is under judgment.<a name=25:20></a> People talk as if God had made man as he is.<a name=25:21></a> Suppose I make a desk and then judge that desk, what do I judge?<a name=25:22></a> Myself.<a name=25:23></a> By our sin we turned God into a Judge instead of a Blesser.<a name=25:24></a> Abel comes to God, and brings his victim, offering the fat of the lamb.<a name=25:25></a> He felt, If I do not get something between me and God, I cannot come near God.<a name=25:26></a>

		The converse of this is also true.<a name=30:6></a> We know that our works are unholy; and when our souls are truly awakened, we look at ourselves as being the spring of these unholy works; and thus we learn that in heart and spirit and nature we are far from God.<a name=30:7></a> Then I am grieved, not only for my sins, but because it is I who committed them.<a name=30:8></a> And this is a present thing.<a name=30:9></a> If I am looking at my works, I may put them off till the day of judgment; but for myself, personally, I cannot be satisfied without the sense of the present and immediate acceptance of God.<a name=30:10></a> I must know that I am at this moment standing in His favour.<a name=30:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not said that God accepted Job till the end of his trials.<a name=30:12></a> And what had his friends done for him during the sifting through which he was passing?<a name=30:13></a> Well might he say, "Miserable comforters are ye all.<a name=30:14></a>" They had no true apprehension of God's character, and so were unable to understand His dealings with a soul.<a name=30:15></a> They had no proper sense of sin, and therefore knew not that, if God would deal in blessing with man, it must be entirely on the ground of grace.<a name=30:16></a> They did not know how to meet his case; and though they had said many true things, yet they had not said one single right thing in its application to Job, for they did not understand him.<a name=30:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		Job had never really been brought into the presence of God.<a name=30:18></a> There had been a certain work in his soul, which produced fruits.<a name=30:19></a> But in chapter 29 we evidently see that he had been walking in the sense of blessings from God, and in a measure in the sense of the fruits of grace produced in his heart.<a name=30:20></a> He was resting in what he was to others, and not in the favour of God Himself.<a name=30:21></a> He owned God, it is true, and bowed under His hand; but notwithstanding he had never been truly in His presence, and consequently his heart had never been searched out.<a name=30:22></a> It was not a question of fruits, but a question of what he was.<a name=30:23></a> So God goes on dealing with job, till in the very thing in which Job was most famous he is brought to nothing.<a name=30:24></a> Job, the most patient man, curses the day of his birth.<a name=30:25></a> Why is this?<a name=30:26></a> Because we must be broken down -- we must be brought to the sense of what we are, as well as of what we have done; and then God can deal with us out of His own heart.<a name=30:27></a> Thus God's dealings with us are intended to bring out really what we are before our own eyes in His presence, in the presence of that eye which looks on while we see what sinners we are.<a name=30:28></a> Thus God went on dealing with Job till Job was brought to say, "I am vile, I abhor myself.<a name=30:29></a>"<a name=31>[Page 31]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 23, we see Job's confidence in God, and his desire for God, although the stroke was bitter.<a name=31:1></a> He said, "Oh!<a name=31:2></a> that I knew where I might find him!<a name=31:3></a>" He did not attempt to keep away from God.<a name=31:4></a> He had that kind of sense of what God was that he wanted to get to Him, "even to his seat.<a name=31:5></a>" It is true he speaks of "ordering his cause before him"; but in chapter 9 where he is speaking of man being justified before God, he says, "If he contend with me, I cannot answer him one of a thousand"; and again, "If I justify myself, my own mouth shall condemn me," Here we find that Job was thinking of being in God's sight.<a name=31:6></a> There was not the wretched hypocritical attempt to keep away from God; there was the consciousness of having to do with God; and in heart he desired to get to Him, though his conscience kept him away.<a name=31:7></a> Thus there was much more truth in Job than in the see-saw truths of his friends; for conscience was in full exercise in him, and not at all in them.<a name=31:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There was also more grace in Job's heart now than when he was floating along in prosperous circumstances.<a name=31:9></a> It was, in truth, trying and miserable work; but still he was finding out what was in him.<a name=31:10></a> And what grace it is in God that He should take up a heart, and thus wring it out, that the soul might be brought, such as it is, into immediate dependence on Himself!<a name=31:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=32>[Page 32]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The sinfulness of Job was brought out, so that he could not say it was not there.<a name=32:1></a> The sinfulness of his heart was brought upon his conscience; it had come fully out; and a terrible thing that is.<a name=32:2></a> We know what it is to the unconverted man; it makes him reckless in iniquity.<a name=32:3></a> Let a man think that he has lost his character, and he will then run loose in wickedness.<a name=32:4></a> When a man comes to this, it thoroughly breaks him down.<a name=32:5></a> It is one thing for a man to lose his character with himself, but it is another and a very different thing to lose it with his neighbour.<a name=32:6></a> But when Job has lost his character, when it is entirely gone, then God comes in.<a name=32:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		After all the sifting, Job is brought into God's presence, and then "Jehovah accepted Job.<a name=32:8></a>" In God's presence his mouth is stopped; then he said, "I am vile"; "I will lay my hand on my mouth.<a name=32:9></a>" But Job must be brought farther, because God is to bring him to Himself; he must be brought to confess not only that there is no good in him, but that there is a great deal of evil.<a name=32:10></a> And this he does, as in verse 3, "I have uttered that I understood not.<a name=32:11></a>" For now it is not a question of condemnation but of sin.<a name=32:12></a> When the sinner has judged himself, the fear of condemnation has passed away.<a name=32:13></a> "I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye seeth thee: wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.<a name=32:14></a>" Thus Job takes God's side against himself.<a name=32:15></a> He laid himself before God, and abhorred himself; and then he repents in dust and ashes; for it is only in the presence of God that we learn repentance.<a name=32:16></a> In its fullest sense true repentance is, when our sin is so thoroughly brought out that we are taking God's side of the question in judging ourselves, and in justifying Him.<a name=32:17></a> Then it is that He justifies us, and makes us accepted in the Beloved.<a name=32:18></a> Then it was that "Jehovah accepted Job.<a name=32:19></a>" And blessed is the man whom the Lord accepteth.<a name=32:20></a> May we indeed feel the need of Him, and not rest in the hypocritical quiet of keeping out of His presence!<a name=32:21></a>

		THE PSALMS
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		INTRODUCTION
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The five Books of Psalms are divided thus: --
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, from Psalm 1 to Psalm 41;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Second, from Psalm 42 to Psalm 72;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Third, from Psalm 73 to Psalm 89;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Fourth, from Psalm 90 to Psalm 106; and
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Fifth, from Psalm 107 to the end.<a name=33:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The subjects of each are different, and may be thus briefly distinguished.<a name=33:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the <i>first</i> book the Jews are not driven out, but go up to the temple, and mix with those in the land.<a name=33:3></a> The name of Jehovah always occurs.<a name=33:4></a> He is in recognised relationship with them.<a name=33:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the <i>second</i> book they are driven out, and only a small seed is left.<a name=33:6></a> The Gentiles combine with the nations against the godly who flee to the mountains.<a name=33:7></a> It is Judah driven out.<a name=33:8></a> "God" is used here, except when hope is expressed.<a name=33:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the <i>third</i> book it is not Jews in Jerusalem, or driven out, but all Israel are taken up.<a name=33:10></a> The ways of God with the people, as such, are found here.<a name=33:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The <i>fourth</i> book begins another range of subjects, While they own Jehovah the dwelling-place, the bringing of Christ into the world again is celebrated; the progress of His coming in glory; His sitting between the cherubim; and the nations coming to worship.<a name=33:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the concluding or <i>fifth</i> book is a review of all, winding up with a chorus, which consists of thanksgivings for the blessings brought in, of which Israel is the earthly centre around and under the Messiah.<a name=33:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		BOOK 1 -- PSALMS 1-41
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two great subjects laid hold of from one end of scripture to the other, founded on the relationships in grace: the government of God; and the church of God.<a name=33:14></a> When I speak of the church of God, I speak of His grace, that which stands only in grace; and when Christ reigns, the church reigns with Him, the weakest and feeblest saint is taken up, and put in the same place with Christ.<a name=33:15></a> Grace is conferred on those who least deserve it.<a name=33:16></a> There is also the government of the Father for those in the church, but this is quite different from the government of God in a general sense.<a name=33:17></a> It is true that gracious principles come in there; but the church is the body of Christ, members of His body, etc.<a name=33:18></a> To be His brethren is another relationship.<a name=33:19></a> God's government of this world is quite a different thing from that.<a name=33:20></a> It is interesting for us, because we have a personal association with the Lord Jesus in His humiliation and His glory, and there is nothing connected with Christ but should interest us.<a name=33:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=34>[Page 34]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The immediate government of God is brought out in connection with Israel, and the Book of Psalms has a peculiar character in relation to this.<a name=34:1></a> The Psalms express the feelings and thoughts of those who find themselves in the circumstances that give rise to them.<a name=34:2></a> When under government, the power of evil must be set aside, in order for those who are separate from it to get free of their sufferings.<a name=34:3></a> With us it is quite different.<a name=34:4></a> We leave the evil, and rise into the glory.<a name=34:5></a> There is also the difference of reigning and being reigned over.<a name=34:6></a> The government of God for earth is entirely connected with Israel -- our home is elsewhere.<a name=34:7></a> They are on earth, and government is connected with earth.<a name=34:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Israel God gives certain laws.<a name=34:9></a> Now grace reigns through righteousness which Another has accomplished.<a name=34:10></a> There will be righteousness on earth when He comes again.<a name=34:11></a> Now it is exactly the contrast.<a name=34:12></a> Righteousness is only in connection with heaven now.<a name=34:13></a> Christ is exalted in heaven, but rejected on earth.<a name=34:14></a> The principle on which all God's dealings with the Jew go is government, although you find mercy put first.<a name=34:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Two things are connected with the Jews in Psalms 1 and 2 God's law written on their hearts (Psalm 1), and their Messiah coming to them, God's king set up on God's throne (Psalm 2).<a name=34:16></a> These are two fundamental principles connected with God's people on the earth.<a name=34:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Psalm 1 we have the effect of godliness, present blessing and in Psalm 2 the place Christ has as King.<a name=34:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first is the application of God's government on the earth, on the godly and the ungodly ones.<a name=34:19></a> There will be the cutting off of the ungodly ones like chaff, and those who remain are the godly.<a name=34:20></a> There is a godly remnant in the midst of the ungodly, and the ungodly are to be cut off.<a name=34:21></a> That is the basis of all we have in the Book of Psalms.<a name=34:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=35>[Page 35]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first characteristic of the godly ones is in contrast with the ungodly.<a name=35:1></a> They delight in the law of Jehovah.<a name=35:2></a> They have tasted the sweetness of the principles in God's word, and know a Christ come down from heaven.<a name=35:3></a> The law characterises all the moral condition of the godly man (Psalm 119).<a name=35:4></a> The remnant in the latter day are associated in character and circumstances with the remnant who believed and followed Christ at His first coming.<a name=35:5></a> The ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, which is spoken of as a present thing.<a name=35:6></a> The godly are in the midst of the ungodly in the presence of judgment, which brings in the day of the Lord.<a name=35:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Psalm 2 is the time when the judgment is ending, and government is made good by the power of the Son exercising His wrath.<a name=35:8></a> "Be wise now therefore, O ye kings," for if the Son's wrath be kindled, all will be over with you.<a name=35:9></a> This has nothing to do with the gospel of God's grace.<a name=35:10></a> The kings of the earth are not in relationship with the Father and the Son, but in rebellion against Jehovah and His Christ.<a name=35:11></a> It is a direct question of judgment -- the closing scene -- distinctly brought to the last day, the day of Jehovah.<a name=35:12></a> He is setting up the king of Israel, never mind what the kings of the earth do.<a name=35:13></a> God's king shall laugh at them.<a name=35:14></a> When Christ was born into this world, God had this purpose in view; and when the King is brought in, the eye will be turned to Him who was before born into the world.<a name=35:15></a> He is to be set up King in Zion, and He is to have the heathen for His possession.<a name=35:16></a> But what does He do?<a name=35:17></a> He breaks their bands in sunder.<a name=35:18></a> I can understand this if it is government, but not if it is gospel.<a name=35:19></a> Matthew 10 shews the gathering out of a remnant, and passing over this time to the end, when the Son of man will be there.<a name=35:20></a> All connected with the gospel is left out, and the kingdom is the subject -- those "worthy" (Matthew 10), not sinners.<a name=35:21></a> It is the witness of the kingdom that is carried on to the time when He comes.<a name=35:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In John 17 Christ says, "I pray not for the world" (I ask not for the heathen now), "but for those whom thou hast given me out of the world.<a name=35:23></a>" He is gathering these now, but He will have the heathen.<a name=35:24></a> He is asking for those who are to be with Him, the results of redemption-work; nothing about the world, not even breaking the nations to pieces.<a name=35:25></a> Again, in John 20, He says to Mary Magdalene, "Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended," etc.<a name=35:26></a> The time was not come for Him to be King, but He would make His brethren know the relationship into which He brought them.<a name=35:27></a> He was not coming to take the kingdom yet, but He would give them the same place that He had.<a name=35:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=36>[Page 36]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Revelation 2: 26, 27 alludes to this psalm.<a name=36:1></a> Under the government of God there is law for rule (Psalm 1).<a name=36:2></a> Psalm 2 declares that, in spite of all the world, He will bring His Son in again, and set Him King.<a name=36:3></a> In the one psalm we get what are the principles of His government, and in the other what are His counsels.<a name=36:4></a> The godly ones are exercised amongst these ungodly ones who are in power.<a name=36:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, remark that Psalms 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 express the exercises of the godly.<a name=36:6></a> In these psalms we find the righteous remnant in the presence of the judgment, looking for the Lord's coming to sustain their faith, and make good His word: but they go through all sorts of trials.<a name=36:7></a> Christ is not yet reigning, evil not yet judged; yet the trials and exercises of the godly remnant before God's judgment on the ungodly help their faith.<a name=36:8></a> God is standing back, as it were.<a name=36:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Psalm 8 is of another character.<a name=36:10></a> Jehovah is to be glorified in this earth, and His glory above the heavens.<a name=36:11></a> He has never been so yet.<a name=36:12></a> The Father's name is glorified in the hearts of His children, but Jehovah is not glorified universally.<a name=36:13></a> 1 Corinthians 15 shews Christ as the Head of the new creation; government in the kingdom is to come in, and, as in Colossians 1, it is to be as Head of the church, He will take the kingdom as Son of man.<a name=36:14></a> Psalm 8 presents Him as thus coming.<a name=36:15></a> It is not yet fulfilled.<a name=36:16></a> "We see not yet all things put under him, but we see Jesus," etc.<a name=36:17></a> He is now gathering the church, who, when He comes, comes with Him.<a name=36:18></a> The only thing in which I can separate myself from Christ is, where He became sin.<a name=36:19></a> Looking at His glory is looking at our own.<a name=36:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Luke 9: 21, 22, being rejected as the Christ, He therefore would not set Himself up as the King.<a name=36:21></a> Then He takes another name -- "Son of man," and as such He must suffer.<a name=36:22></a> He drops for the time the title of Christ, as in Psalm 2, which sets Him forth as the anointed King, and takes the title of Psalm 8 -- "Son of man.<a name=36:23></a>" But He must suffer.<a name=36:24></a> "Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die," etc.<a name=36:25></a> As Christ they may say nothing about Him then.<a name=36:26></a> As Son of man He is to have all under Him, not only is He to be King in Zion.<a name=36:27></a> That will be accomplished too; but, according to Isaiah 49: 6, He is to have the Gentiles also.<a name=36:28></a> He is to be over everything; and as a man He is to take all things.<a name=36:29></a> God will gather together in one all things in Christ, we being in the heavenly part, and Satan under our feet, In the Psalms we get the Christ we are associated with, but not our association with Him.<a name=36:30></a> The scheme of the government of God has never yet begun.<a name=36:31></a> It has not yet been the new covenant, but the old.<a name=36:32></a> Christ is to be King, and this is prophetically, not historically, given in Psalm 2; He is also Son of man in Psalm 8, which is prophetic.<a name=36:33></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=37>[Page 37]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Psalm 9 looks at the wicked as not yet put out.<a name=37:1></a> The time is not come for righteousness to be made good.<a name=37:2></a> Divine righteousness is accomplished through His death, but government in righteousness not yet established.<a name=37:3></a> Psalm 2 is not fulfilled, only the opposition of the kings, etc.<a name=37:4></a> In Psalm 10 there is distress for the remnant until the interposition of God comes.<a name=37:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Psalms 11 to 15 disclose feelings of the remnant; but there is confidence in God in time of trial.<a name=37:6></a> Christ puts into their hearts just what they want in the circumstances.<a name=37:7></a> Psalm 12 is the extremity of their distress -- a godly man scarcely to be found.<a name=37:8></a> Psalm 13 is deeper distress of soul because of a sense of its being from God.<a name=37:9></a> The faith of God's people cannot go on for ever; they cry, "How long?<a name=37:10></a>" "Art thou treating us as if given up?<a name=37:11></a> If it goes on thus, I shall faint under it!<a name=37:12></a>" Psalm 14 is the character of the wicked to be cut off, as Psalm 15 is the character of the remnant who stand.<a name=37:13></a> The practically godly remnant will have the blessing when Christ comes.<a name=37:14></a> There is in Psalms 9, 10, the history of the tribulation -- the fact of judgment; and then in Psalms 11, 12 and 13, their condition, thoughts, and feelings; and Psalm 15, the character of those on the holy hill, in contrast with the wicked set forth in Psalm 14.<a name=37:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Psalm 16 Christ is the link between Jehovah and the remnant.<a name=37:16></a> He is passing through this world so as to be able to speak a word in season to the remnant in the last day.<a name=37:17></a> He could not go and associate Himself with them in that way without the atonement being made.<a name=37:18></a> We have the figure in Aaron going into the holy place on the day of atonement.<a name=37:19></a> We are associated with Him within.<a name=37:20></a> Isaiah 53: "We hid as it were our faces from him" is the expression of the Jews in the latter day, linking themselves with those who rejected Christ when He was here the first time.<a name=37:21></a>

		<a name=38>[Page 38]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this first book of the Psalms the godly remnant are not driven out of Jerusalem.<a name=38:1></a> This applied to Christ personally.<a name=38:2></a> He was on this side Jordan, with the poor of the flock, He was walking with them -- His path in life.<a name=38:3></a> There is more personal association of Christ with the remnant in the latter day.<a name=38:4></a> There is more appeal to Jehovah in this book than to God, which characterises the second book.<a name=38:5></a> Jehovah is the title God has especially connected with the people of Israel, the seed of Abraham; and their relationship with Him in the land is thus acknowledged.<a name=38:6></a> It is better to read "Jehovah" instead of LORD, which we have very vague and undefined in our minds generally, though it is a most blessed title.<a name=38:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Psalm 16 Christ, before taking His place on high, has experimentally "the tongue of the learned.<a name=38:8></a>" "In thee do I put my trust.<a name=38:9></a>" This is quoted in Hebrews 2 to prove Christ's humanity.<a name=38:10></a> There are two things make perfection in a man -- dependence and obedience.<a name=38:11></a> They were in Christ, the contrast of what was in Adam when he sinned.<a name=38:12></a> His heart could be moved with compassion, and not only could He shew His power to work miracles, but He could take this place of the dependent and obedient One, and it is there the heart gets food.<a name=38:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God has His food in the offering, but there was the meat-offering, and part of the peace-offering, which the priests ate.<a name=38:14></a> He says, "Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.<a name=38:15></a>" Then we feed.<a name=38:16></a> The Father has given us the very object He delights in for the object of our affection.<a name=38:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this psalm He first definitely takes His place with the excellent of the earth.<a name=38:18></a> He is thus the comfort of His people in sorrow; and when we have peace, He is the food of our souls -- the heart has the perfect good to feed on.<a name=38:19></a> He is the object before the soul -- He is properly the food of our souls, not in glory, but in humiliation, as here.<a name=38:20></a> "I am the true bread that came down from heaven.<a name=38:21></a>" It does not say, the bread that went up to heaven.<a name=38:22></a> Then His flesh is needed for life, we must know Him as dead.<a name=38:23></a> We cannot feed on Him as the living and glorified Christ, but as the dead Christ.<a name=38:24></a> What draws out our affections to Christ is, what He was down here, going through all the difficulties, making His passage through everything about which He has to intercede for us now.<a name=38:25></a>

		Psalms 16, 17, give us two great principles of divine life -- trust and righteousness, or integrity; and we find them running all through the Psalms, and any godly person's life, as well as that of the Jew: but this does not give the foundation fully on which we stand.<a name=41:10></a>, according to the New Testament.<a name=41:11></a> You do not find in Psalm 17 the foundation of God's righteousness at this time.<a name=41:12></a> Souls in the condition of having divine life, but not knowing their standing in divine righteousness, find the suitability of the Psalms to express their experience.<a name=41:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Psalm 16 it is divine life in dependence, obedience, and communion.<a name=41:14></a> The first characteristic of divine life is trust -- Christ putting His trust in Jehovah.<a name=41:15></a> As a man He does it.<a name=41:16></a> We see Him praying, the true expression of dependence; and in Luke's Gospel this is especially brought out.<a name=41:17></a> Then another principle of divine life is the consciousness of integrity, there may be both these -- trust in God and consciousness of integrity, without peace with God.<a name=41:18></a> Job said, "Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him"; and he pleaded his own righteousness against God.<a name=41:19></a> "Till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me.<a name=41:20></a>" He had the consciousness of sin and the sense of righteousness, integrity in himself at the same time.<a name=41:21></a> The soul cannot be at peace in this state.<a name=41:22></a> Job was wrong in making a righteousness of his integrity.<a name=41:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This second principle of divine life we have in Psalm 17.<a name=41:24></a> It is the kind of righteousness the Jews will have in the latter day -- the same which they had of old.<a name=41:25></a> God stays up the souls that trust in Him until they see Christ.<a name=41:26></a> Having a promise, they trust, but cannot say, "I have the righteousness of God.<a name=41:27></a>" Christ having taken up their condition, and borne it, they have the consciousness of integrity through him; and it is the stay of their souls, but not peace.<a name=41:28></a> They will find such utterances as this, "Out of the depths have I cried unto thee," suit their own experience; they will be comforted by finding the word of God giving expression to their thoughts and feelings; it will be a prop and stay to them in the midst of their exercises, but they will not get peace in it.<a name=41:29></a> This Psalm 17 applies to the remnant surrounded by their enemies -- ours are spiritual enemies.<a name=41:30></a> Here is the reality of enemies pressing round Christ.<a name=41:31></a> The remnant will find every imperfectly formed feeling of their hearts has been perfectly gone through and expressed by Him, He having put Himself in their place.<a name=41:32></a> In trusting, and in the consciousness of integrity, He has been before them.<a name=41:33></a>

		In Psalm 1 we saw the righteous man, delighting in the law and the normal results of the earthly government of God as to just and unjust.<a name=58:1></a> Then Psalm 2 declared that, spite of all the world, He will bring in His incarnate Son, and set Him as king on the holy hill of Zion; the latter exhibiting the counsels, as the former did the governmental principles, of God.<a name=58:2></a> Psalms 3-7 express the exercises of the godly amongst the ungodly who are in power.<a name=58:3></a> In these psalms, consequently, we hear the righteous remnant looking for the Lord's coming in judgment to sustain their faith and make good His word; but they pass through every sort of trial, for the circumstances suppose that Christ is not reigning over the earth, and that evil is not yet judged.<a name=58:4></a> God is standing back as it were; nevertheless He turns these trials of circumstances and exercises of heart of the godly to their profit, a blessing much deeper than if the judgment fell at once on the ungodly.<a name=58:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I need hardly say that there are many aspects in which we may consider the character of our Lord Jesus Christ; for He is the summing up of all possible beauty and perfection in Himself.<a name=60:1></a> But He is more than this.<a name=60:2></a> He is the means and measure by which we can judge of everything besides.<a name=60:3></a> If I want to know God, I must learn Him in Christ.<a name=60:4></a> If I want to know what man is in perfection, I learn it by Christ.<a name=60:5></a> In a word, all real truth is learnt, and learnt only, in or by Christ.<a name=60:6></a> Whether it be man, or sin, or death, or life, or love, or hatred, all is manifested in Christ, or by Christ.<a name=60:7></a> Hence the importance of having the soul occupied with Christ, of feeding on Him, since He is the only transforming power, and the only standard of excellence, and the light by which all things else are made manifest.<a name=60:8></a>

		It is not the joy of deliverance that is presented in this psalm, nor the work by which deliverance is accomplished; but rather the Deliverer in His humiliation and walk on earth, drawn out as the attractive object of our souls.<a name=60:9></a> For Christ is an object in a double way.<a name=60:10></a> He is an object in glory to attract our souls upward from the earth, as it is said, "seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God.<a name=60:11></a>" But He is no less an object in His humiliation as presenting the embodiment of all moral excellence before God, and that in a world through which we are called to pass.<a name=60:12></a>

		If we contemplate Christ in glory, this gives us the definiteness of that hope to which we are predestinated, for we are predestinated to be conformed to the image of God's Son.<a name=60:13></a> "We shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.<a name=60:14></a>" This awakens the energy of hope, of joy, and gladness.<a name=60:15></a> If we are delivered from death, through the blood of Christ, we are also planted in Him as the objects of God's delight.<a name=60:16></a> Christ's position before the Father, and His relation to Him, mark our position and relationship through infinite grace; for He says, "I ascend to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.<a name=60:17></a>" We are like Him in the sight of His Father, and our praises should not jar with His.<a name=60:18></a>

		It is not good for the soul only to contemplate Christ as an agent, important as this is in its place.<a name=61:1></a> No question, if I am feeding on Christ, dwelling on Him with admiration and delight and joy, as the object of my soul, it pre-supposes a knowledge of Him as an agent accomplishing redemption by His death, and having taken His place on high for us, and so maintaining the integrity of our position before God and our communion with Him.<a name=61:2></a> But if I am looking at the priesthood of Christ, precious and necessary as it is, He is still before me, more as an agent than the object of my soul.<a name=61:3></a> As priest, He is a servant in grace.<a name=61:4></a> To see Him girded thus for service doubtless draws out the affections, and gives power and energy, and brightens our hearts all along the road.<a name=61:5></a> But then all manner of exercise of heart comes in here; because Christ deals with us in this according to what we practically are.<a name=61:6></a> The priesthood of Christ has to do with weakness and infirmities, with the ever-varying exercises of the soul: and hence it is said, "we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous," Righteousness ever abides in God's presence, and hence the ground of the restoration of communion when it has been lost.<a name=61:7></a> If any man sin, we are not driven to a distance but the soul is restored because Christ has prayed for us.<a name=61:8></a> It is not that we have to ask Him to intercede, or to exercise His priesthood for us, but that He has done so; for the movement of grace is always on His heart.<a name=61:9></a> The priesthood of Christ is for those who are righteous, who are redeemed, in order to carry them on through the wilderness of this world.<a name=61:10></a> He is their Advocate, constantly carrying on their affairs, and the Holy Ghost is spoken of by the same title (for "the Comforter" is indeed the Advocate).<a name=61:11></a>

		He never forgot Israel for a single day, because all their supplies in the wilderness depended on His remembrance and faithful care; and His care as our High Priest and Advocate is the same to us now.<a name=62:1></a> In all this Christ is an agent; but in this psalm He is an object -- an object in His humiliation, and, more properly, the food of our souls.<a name=62:2></a> He is not our food in glory, but in humiliation.<a name=62:3></a> We feed on Him here, as a living and dead Christ.<a name=62:4></a> Christ does not say in John 6, "The bread of God is he" which went up to heaven; but "He which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world.<a name=62:5></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		That which especially draws out our affections is the tracing of Christ's passage through this world, through everything down here about which He has to deal with us.<a name=62:6></a> When He was on earth, the Father could delight in Him in the beginning of His path, on account of His inherent excellence; and at the close, because of His developed perfection.<a name=62:7></a> He could say, "This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased"; and God has given us for delight, the very same object in which He delights.<a name=62:8></a> What do we say then?<a name=62:9></a> Why, in weakness and poverty, it is true, yet surely, with unhesitating confidence, we say the same!<a name=62:10></a> We cannot indeed reach His perfectness in our thoughts; but then the very sense we have of the poverty and weakness of our apprehensions is because the Father has shewn us something of His perfectness.<a name=62:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Father, in communicating His own delight, does not say, This is My beloved Son in whom you ought to be well pleased, but in whom I am well pleased.<a name=62:12></a> How marvellous that the Father should tell us what His thoughts are about His Son, and what His delight is in Him!<a name=62:13></a> It was not what was true about Christ that attracted the poor woman in Simon's house (Luke 7: 37-50), but it was the beauty and attractiveness of Christ Himself that absorbed her heart.<a name=62:14></a> She loved and admired Him for what He was, before she knew what He was for her.<a name=62:15></a> When she knew this, she could reflect upon it, and this would give the ground of constancy to her affections and delight.<a name=62:16></a> Jesus commended all she did -- her tears -- her affection -- her silence; because all were drawn forth by her contemplation of Himself.<a name=62:17></a>

		THOUGHTS ON PSALM 16
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As Psalm 15 gives the character of those who will have their portion with Christ in His kingdom, when God sets Him as King in Zion, so in Psalm 16 Christ Himself seems to say, I have come down from that place God Himself had assigned Me, and taken My place in the pathway of faith -- the very same that you are in -- the place of rejection, of sorrow, of suffering, the place that the godly remnant find themselves in.<a name=66:1></a> Therefore is His cry to God.<a name=66:2></a> He used not His own divine power to escape any suffering; and, remember, it was not suffering for sin, not chastening, but the path of faith -- as He says, "Thou wilt shew me the path of life.<a name=66:3></a>" Therefore had He His ear opened morning by morning.<a name=66:4></a> He fully entered into the sorrows of the wilderness.<a name=66:5></a> There is not a sorrow comes upon a saint, not a trial of faith in which we can find ourselves, but Christ can fully sympathise with us in it.<a name=66:6></a> If we only set our foot in the narrow way (it is with the new nature He sympathises), then we find this blessed One has been before us.<a name=66:7></a> It is astonishing how much we are sustained by circumstances, how we lean upon the circumstances that the Lord never had in His path.<a name=66:8></a> Much of our joy is derived from a thousand things that Christ never had joy in, and that gave Him not a moment's sustainment.<a name=66:9></a> We may find ourselves losing, or in danger of losing, not a few things by faithfulness.<a name=66:10></a> What then?<a name=66:11></a> We shall only be brought nearer to the Lord Himself.<a name=66:12></a> If the path becomes rougher than ever it was before, surely we shall find only the more of the sympathy of Him who has trodden it in all its roughness.<a name=66:13></a> Therefore can He be called "the Author and Finisher of faith," because He has run the whole course of faith.<a name=66:14></a> He has suffered every kind of suffering and trial that besets the path.<a name=66:15></a> We may each one of us have this or that peculiar trial or sorrow.<a name=66:16></a> Ours is but a taste of that which He drank to the dregs -- like a shade of that which in its real depth of grief He knew.<a name=66:17></a> The contradiction of sinners beset Him on every side.<a name=66:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may know somewhat of it in any little measure of faithfulness we shew.<a name=66:19></a> We may be called to give up father and mother, or, as the Lord says, to "hate father and mother," etc.<a name=66:20></a> But what had He to comfort Him from any such sources?<a name=66:21></a> Everything like a prop here was gone, yet could He say in the face of all that, "The lines are fallen to me in pleasant places, yea, I have a goodly heritage.<a name=66:22></a> Thou wilt shew me the path of life.<a name=66:23></a>" Suppose death comes, Jesus could say, "My flesh also shall rest in hope.<a name=66:24></a>" Hezekiah knew and said in his trial, By all these things men live, and in all these things is the life of the spirit.<a name=66:25></a>

		There is chastening, and the like, needed by us; but Christ never sought to do anything but to please God.<a name=67:1></a> His sufferings therefore proceeded only from His walking in the path of life.<a name=67:2></a> All that could try faith came upon Him, while He was without anything which we have so fully that could sustain nature.<a name=67:3></a> Still we find Him in death trusting in God.<a name=67:4></a> "Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither," etc.<a name=67:5></a> The path of life was perfectly opened out to us in Christ.<a name=67:6></a> There is a deep joy in entering in spirit into Christ's paths.<a name=67:7></a> The remnant enter into it in Psalm 20.<a name=67:8></a> The thorough realising of what Christ was as a man down here.<a name=67:9></a> There is nothing lays hold on the heart, nothing feeds it, like that.<a name=67:10></a> Every sorrow that the heart of any can go through, as walking in the path of righteousness, Jesus knew in His path.<a name=67:11></a> This renders His sympathy so peculiarly sweet.<a name=67:12></a> Any exaggeration would be dangerous on this subject, thus taking away our portion.<a name=67:13></a> It is true fellowship with Christ's sufferings that gives the energy of hope.<a name=67:14></a> This is drawn out by the glory being unfolded to us by His sufferings.<a name=67:15></a> I am more and more struck in reading the Psalms thus as connected with the Jews.<a name=67:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When I look at the church, I can only say it is nothing but sovereign grace that picks up wretched sinners and links them with Jesus, giving them the same place, the same portion, "heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ.<a name=67:17></a>" I can only gaze with wonder and adore.<a name=67:18></a> It was the counsel of God from everlasting -- His sovereign grace.<a name=67:19></a> I cannot then talk of God's government or His dealings with us, since no principles of government could make us members of Christ's body, etc.<a name=67:20></a> It was all sovereign grace.<a name=67:21></a> The church is the fulness, the body, of Christ.<a name=67:22></a> Once lay hold of that, and what is the consequence?<a name=67:23></a> It draws out wonder, admiration, worship.<a name=67:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But that is not all; there is another thing for us.<a name=67:25></a> What mercy to know that my salvation is secure!<a name=67:26></a> But now as set free from anxiety about myself I am to be occupied with Him by whom all this wondrous work was wrought.<a name=67:27></a> I find there is not a sorrow or difficulty in the pathway of life which He is not interested in.<a name=67:28></a> This is other knowledge than the knowledge of salvation.<a name=67:29></a> It draws out trust and confidence and love, as Job says, "Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him.<a name=67:30></a>" We find Christ Himself going through it all -- not suffering for sin indeed, but for righteousness.<a name=67:31></a> Only on the cross did He know what it was to suffer for sin -- our sins.<a name=67:32></a> There indeed He knew the forsaking of God.<a name=67:33></a> If I suffer as a saint, I find the full sympathy of Jesus.<a name=67:34></a> If for sin, the Lord has no sympathy with sin, though He Himself needed to suffer for us, and thus to become known to us not as the Bread that came down from heaven only, but giving His flesh for the life of the world (John 6).<a name=67:35></a> Do you thus feed upon Him?<a name=67:36></a> Do you know Him as thus made the food for your souls, that which turns into the substance of life?<a name=67:37></a> Then feed on Him.<a name=67:38></a> This is what the knowledge of Him leads to.<a name=67:39></a> It is another thing from the energy of hope.<a name=67:40></a> The effect of being occupied with the glory, where Christ now is, is to enable us to overcome the difficulties that obstruct our way and to reach forward.<a name=67:41></a>

		Occupation with His walk as a man shews us the path of godliness.<a name=68:1></a> We see Him taking it in His baptism.<a name=68:2></a> When those whose eyes were opened to see the principles of the kingdom (conscious that they were bearing anything but the good fruit) took the place of confession, Jesus was there.<a name=68:3></a> The One who had so fully taken the place as man as to say to God, "Thou art my Lord," says also of the saints, "In them is all my delight.<a name=68:4></a>" We find this in Hebrews 2 -- "He is not ashamed to call them brethren, for both he that sanctifieth, and they who are sanctified are all of one.<a name=68:5></a>"

		"Being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself," etc.<a name=68:6></a> His state was not having a will to do something or other that must be stopped; no, He could say, "Lo, I come to do thy will.<a name=68:7></a>" Such is christian obedience, and true liberty, not to require checking in our wills, but to have the same kind of obedience as Christ's.<a name=68:8></a> He stands alone in Ills sufferings in our stead.<a name=68:9></a> Nothing equals the glory that He will have as the Saviour of sinners.<a name=68:10></a> Other glory we share with Him, but in that He is alone.<a name=68:11></a> In His walk He sets us an example.<a name=68:12></a> In His trust in God, etc.<a name=68:13></a>, He never takes a single step to get the reward of obedience, but asks of His Father, as -- in John 17, "Father, glorify thy Son," etc.<a name=68:14></a>; and here, in the simplest confidence, "Thou wilt not leave my soul," etc.<a name=68:15></a> Patience with Him had its perfect work.<a name=68:16></a> He never stirs even when they told Him, "he whom thou lovest is sick.<a name=68:17></a>" He waited patiently till the right time; and now His desire for His people is that they might have His joy fulfilled in themselves -- that joy which He knew when He said, "My meat is to do the will," etc.<a name=68:18></a> He trod the path of sorrow and rejection here, but He had joy in that very path, as He says, "The lines are fallen to me in pleasant places.<a name=68:19></a>"

		In the measure in which we enter into the path, we get communion with Christ.<a name=69:3></a> The affections of Christ more known to us, we become better acquainted, as it were, with the heart of Christ.<a name=69:4></a> This is not a question of safety, but of growing up unto Him.<a name=69:5></a> The heavens were opened over Him when He took the place publicly of identifying Himself with those who were in reality the godly.<a name=69:6></a> When we get into that place, the Spirit of God can lead us into the understanding of these things -- taking of the things of Christ, and shewing them unto us.<a name=69:7></a> But if one say, I am not there, cannot we delight in tracing Christ in it?<a name=69:8></a> Even if we are not walking in the place as we should be, it is most blessed to trace His walk in it.<a name=69:9></a> It is our privilege to walk in it, our highest privilege here; and so only shall we be fully able to enjoy our proper portion, Christ, as led and taught of the Spirit.<a name=69:10></a>

		PSALM 25
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is something to touch us in seeing a soul open out to God without yet enjoying deliverance.<a name=70:1></a> It knows well that he who waits on God shall not be confounded; but peace is not there though seen from afar.<a name=70:2></a> We must remark the manner in which God receives this opening of heart.<a name=70:3></a> He takes cognisance of all that passes in the soul: fear, hope, sins, deliverance.<a name=70:4></a> God would have us understand that He occupies Himself with it all.<a name=70:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Psalms, because of their prophetic character, are the expression of the Holy Spirit's operation in the soul before it finds peace.<a name=70:6></a> They do not give the definitive answer of the love of God.<a name=70:7></a> There is in our hearts a depth of hardness, of insensibility, of levity such that it is needful God should take pains with them to fix them and bring them down to the feeling of their incapacity.<a name=70:8></a> God fixes the soul by the sense of its wants.<a name=70:9></a> We are so miserable that the only means of giving us the idea of God's love is by fixing the heart through its wants on the contemplation of what God is; so that where the sense of want fails the love of God is totally unknown, as if it did not exist.<a name=70:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In verses 7-11 there is a deep principle.<a name=70:11></a> It is only when we are thoroughly convinced that our iniquity is "great" that we feel the need we have of God and of His pardon.<a name=70:12></a> One might think of a little iniquity that one had just to remedy oneself, or that God might pass it over.<a name=70:13></a> The heart of man upsets everything.<a name=70:14></a> He puts the uprightness of Jehovah before His grace, His truth before His mercy, and thinks that, if a man walk as he ought, God will be good toward him.<a name=70:15></a> That is just the contrary of what is said here.<a name=70:16></a> "Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions: according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness' sake, O LORD.<a name=70:17></a> Good and upright is the LORD: therefore will he teach sinners in the way.<a name=70:18></a> The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his way.<a name=70:19></a> All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.<a name=70:20></a> For thy name's sake, O LORD, pardon mine iniquity; for it is great," verse 7-11.<a name=70:21></a> Jehovah who is "upright" loves uprightness; but before all He would have the wretched sinner know Him as "good.<a name=70:22></a>" The ill-enlightened soul that knows its faults up to a certain point desires to arrive at enjoying the goodness of God by its own uprightness.<a name=70:23></a> It is the proof of a state of heart which knows not God and which hardens itself against all the history He has given of man's heart, as well as of Himself, in the word.<a name=70:24></a> Hardness of heart rises against the grace of God, and nothing more hinders grace from acting than the thought that, if one is upright, God will be good; and this, because the heart is neither lowly nor softened, and pride is not yet destroyed therein.<a name=70:25></a>

		Man wishes that one should not speak to him of his sins.<a name=71:1></a> The action of the Holy Spirit, on the contrary, makes one own and confess sin in detail.<a name=71:2></a> We can speak of sin in general, or yet more of the sins of which we are not guilty; but otherwise a man does not speak of his own sins.<a name=71:3></a> Did not Peter say to the Jews, "Ye denied the Holy One and the Just," although he had done so himself in a manner still more shameful?<a name=71:4></a> Why did he speak of that sin without blushing?<a name=71:5></a> The Holy Spirit alone could give him to do so through Him who came by water and blood, Paul when converted and in peace speaks freely to the Lord Jesus of the sins he had done against His name and saints.<a name=71:6></a> An unconverted man can speak of evil or of other sins than his own, having no confidence in God's grace for eternal life or remission.<a name=71:7></a> A thief may blame a drunkard; but no one naturally speaks of his own sins, because the conscience avoids being upright before God.<a name=71:8></a> Men would hide their sins and shew their good qualities; they would pass as honest good sort of people, and get rid of God.<a name=71:9></a> In that case one has no need of the goodness of God.<a name=71:10></a> People will try to meet the goodness of God by a certain uprightness; but there is no true confidence in God, and every hope of rendering worship to God in this state of things is a fraud.<a name=71:11></a> God begins with what we are; He takes us such as we are; and man will not have it so.<a name=71:12></a>

		But one may also be convinced of sin and seek to recover before God the place one has lost.<a name=72:1></a> This soul believes that there is some means other than pure pardon.<a name=72:2></a> It has not yet true relations with God.<a name=72:3></a> It cannot any longer seek the world; it observes the Lord's day; it attends meetings, and rests on the like.<a name=72:4></a> But then the soul is not convinced that God is love, any more than it is in the presence of God with a true knowledge of itself.<a name=72:5></a> Not being humbled, it chooses itself a way to arrive at God, and cannot say, "I wait on thee," as in verses 5, 21.<a name=72:6></a> It is when we are convinced there is no question of getting to God, but that we are in His presence and lost, that we can say, "For thy name's sake, O Jehovah, pardon mine iniquity; for it is great.<a name=72:7></a>" There is no more thought of bettering the conduct in order to get to God; there is no more a way to pave.<a name=72:8></a> We no longer desire then to avoid God, but we see ourselves before Him such as we are.<a name=72:9></a> If God is revealed, we have to understand that which He is Himself, and then comes the knowledge of His grace.<a name=72:10></a> It is a question of knowing what God is in respect to the sinner who is always in His presence.<a name=72:11></a> God is always "good," and He will not sanction the wickedness of man in leaving him quiet though hardened.<a name=72:12></a> Instead of reproaching with the sin, God brings to the conviction of sin in making it felt that He has seen the sin, that He has thought of it, and that He has found a means of pardoning and of teaching sinners the way they should follow.<a name=72:13></a>

		"For thy goodness' sake," "for thy name's sake"; there is ground on which the soul founds its confidence.<a name=72:14></a> Impossible that God should fail His own name (John 17: 6).<a name=72:15></a> He is "good and upright.<a name=72:16></a>" What does the goodness of God to a trembling and miserable sinner?<a name=72:17></a> It does not cast up to him his misery, but takes cognisance of it to inspire him with full confidence and give him courage.<a name=72:18></a> God would deny Himself if He failed in His goodness in this case.<a name=72:19></a> God cannot do otherwise; He sees to His own name, His glory, His truth, His grace, in a word to all that He is, as we read in the father of the prodigal son (Luke 15: 20-25).<a name=72:20></a>

		God makes us understand that He occupies Himself with our sins long before we ourselves were occupied with them.<a name=72:21></a> If the goodness of God is occupied with them, it must be that He is so to get rid of them altogether, and He has given Jesus for this purpose.<a name=72:22></a> To blot out our sins completely -- there is what God's goodness would and must do.<a name=72:23></a> But if one would arrive at pardon by progress in holiness, it is to choose the road for oneself God puts the sinner at his ease in His presence by shewing him his sins on the head of Jesus.<a name=72:24></a> His glory would not be complete if the believer were not justified.<a name=72:25></a> It is a salvation accomplished for ever that God presents to us, and the soul is in peace.<a name=72:26></a> All this is for His name's sake.<a name=72:27></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There are some special Psalms connected with Christ, round which others seem clustered.<a name=75:1></a> This is one of them.<a name=75:2></a> Here is Christ's actual association with His people on earth, not only in their sorrows, but at length bearing their sins, so that all who looked to Him might be blessed with Him.<a name=75:3></a> "I am poor and needy, yet the Lord thinketh upon me.<a name=75:4></a>" Christ did not take one step to save Himself.<a name=75:5></a> He might have had twelve legions of angels, but He was waiting on the Lord.<a name=75:6></a>

		He appeals to God as Jehovah, not Father, because this was not then brought out, as it is now.<a name=75:7></a> The Jew did not know the Father as He is now revealed; and Christ was taking the place of a godly man made under the law amongst them.<a name=75:8></a> Therefore He is spoken of in terms suiting the relationship known to the Jews.<a name=75:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One or two verses often bring out the subject of the psalm, the rest being the development of it.<a name=75:10></a> What He did in the position He took up is the great thing here -- what He went through, what He felt.<a name=75:11></a> The grand principle is, that He "waited patiently for Jehovah" -- the relationship in which Christ as a man was standing on the earth as connected with the remnant of Israel.<a name=75:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is clear that the different names of God have a most important meaning, because they are the revelation of what He is to all, If I call Him Father, I own what He is to me as His child.<a name=75:13></a> If "Jehovah" be employed, it is what He is in caring for and keeping His earthly people, whom He had called out in order to shew His ways in government.<a name=75:14></a> If "God Almighty" be used, it is as protector of His pilgrims as Abram, Isaac, and Jacob in going from one country to another, or abiding in presence of hostile races in Canaan.<a name=75:15></a> For us it is Father.<a name=75:16></a> "Holy Father, keep through thine own name," etc.<a name=75:17></a> It is important for us to know our position, as well as to see what position Christ was in when expressing these Psalms.<a name=75:18></a> In Matthew 5 He says, "Be ye perfect, as your Father in heaven is perfect.<a name=75:19></a>" He teaches us that we are to shew forth grace and not law, as the Father was doing in Himself.<a name=75:20></a> Therefore we have to act after the same character: and nothing else suits those who belong to the kingdom of heaven and have the revelation of the Father's name.<a name=75:21></a>

		Here, in Psalm 40, His heart is with the poor remnant.<a name=76:1></a> He undertakes their cause, going through all their sorrow and bearing their sins.<a name=76:2></a> In the last it is for them, not with them; but He gives them the comfort of being taken up to the same place with Himself, putting a new song into their mouths, as Jehovah had into His.<a name=76:3></a> "Many shall see it and fear, and shall trust in the Lord.<a name=76:4></a>" But, moreover He says, in verse 6, "Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.<a name=76:5></a>" These are all put aside.<a name=76:6></a> "He taketh away the first to establish the second.<a name=76:7></a>" Christ came to do God's will.<a name=76:8></a> Everything centres in the Son.<a name=76:9></a> All blessing is connected with relationship to Him, whether for outcast reprobates (Gentiles), or for God's people, the Jews, who had broken the covenant.<a name=76:10></a> The Levitical system vanishes away as not meeting God's desires any more than man's need.<a name=76:11></a> Christ, who says "Lo, I come to do thy will," is everything.<a name=76:12></a> Then He "preached righteousness in the great congregation.<a name=76:13></a>" This cost Him His life.<a name=76:14></a> He made perfectly good God's character in the world -- went out to all the people -- declared God's faithfulness -- did not hide His righteousness within His heart, and got into miry clay in consequence, that is, all that can press a man down.<a name=76:15></a> "I have glorified thee on the earth.<a name=76:16></a>" "I have not concealed thy loving-kindness and thy truth from the great congregation.<a name=76:17></a>" "Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me," for I have been declaring what Thou art in faithfulness; withhold not Thou Thy tender mercies from Me.<a name=76:18></a> Then He goes farther (verse 12), for He came to suffer not only with but for us.<a name=76:19></a> "For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities have taken hold upon me.<a name=76:20></a>" Not merely <i>our</i> there, but "MINE.<a name=76:21></a>" If speaking amongst the remnant He might have said our; but when taking them on Himself, standing alone for their deliverance, He says "mine.<a name=76:22></a>"

		In Psalm 72 we have the Solomon reign, not the Davidical state.<a name=94:9></a> The true Son of David is, no doubt, much greater than Solomon.<a name=94:10></a> Here Christ is King.<a name=94:11></a> This takes us back to Psalm 2.<a name=94:12></a> Jehovah's determination is to set His kingdom in Zion.<a name=94:13></a> The kingdom is not confined to this setting up of the King.<a name=94:14></a> In Matthew 13: 43 we have the "kingdom of the Father.<a name=94:15></a>" There we get its heavenly character, not setting aside the kingdom on earth, which is to be established; but it goes farther and higher.<a name=94:16></a> "Every scribe instructed .<a name=94:17></a>.<a name=94:18></a>.<a name=94:19></a> brings out of his treasure things new and old.<a name=94:20></a>" The scribes had the old things concerning the kingdom, but they stumbled at the Christ having to suffer.<a name=94:21></a> If they had received Christ, man would not have been proved to be such a sinner.<a name=94:22></a> But they hated both Him and His Father, and so proved there is no good in flesh.<a name=94:23></a> There would have been something good in flesh if they could have received Him.<a name=94:24></a> The kingdom was not set up then through their not receiving Him.<a name=94:25></a> Two things came out after that: the mystery of the kingdom of heaven, and the church.<a name=94:26></a> What is the kingdom?<a name=94:27></a> It is very simple, if we take the word as it is.<a name=94:28></a> It is the sphere of the reign, or where the King reigns.<a name=94:29></a> if I take the word church as "assembly," which it really means, I can never confound "church" and "kingdom.<a name=94:30></a>" Compare the word "reign" with "assembly," and the difference is easily seen.<a name=94:31></a>

		The thing we have to learn is Christ.<a name=104:1></a> We may learn a good deal in ourselves, but all that is for blessing will be in Christ.<a name=104:2></a> This is what the apostle means (Hebrews 6: 1) when he speaks of going on to perfection.<a name=104:3></a> It is vain to learn the first principles over and over again; if we have learnt that, let us go on to learn Christ -- learn Him in all His characters, and in all our exercises.<a name=104:4></a> To know Christ is to know Him in all His various glories.<a name=104:5></a> At one time we have to look on Him as Jehovah at another, as a suffering Man.<a name=104:6></a>

		Here comes a testimony concerning the Most High.<a name=104:7></a> We have in this verse 1 a general truth: the person that dwells in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.<a name=104:8></a> Verse 2.<a name=104:9></a> The words of Jesus are brought out: I will say of Jehovah He is my refuge and my fortress; my God, in Him will I trust.<a name=104:10></a> The apostle, in Hebrews 2: 13, refers to this and other parts in the Psalms as the words of Christ.<a name=104:11></a> The apostle declares, I will put my trust in Him, to be our Lord's expression whilst walking in the midst of trial on the earth.<a name=104:12></a> Then (verse 3-13) we come to the testimony of the Spirit concerning Jesus.<a name=104:13></a> Verse 9.<a name=104:14></a> This was true in its perfectness of the Lord Jesus; it applies in all its extent only to Him.<a name=104:15></a> In verse 14 we get the declaration of the Father, "because he hath set his love upon me.<a name=104:16></a>" This was true, and true only of Jesus.<a name=104:17></a> He was the only One who set His love on God.<a name=104:18></a> We love Him because He first loved us.<a name=104:19></a> In our Lord's sufferings we learn the principle and fulness of love.<a name=104:20></a>

		This psalm (102) is one of peculiar strength and blessedness to the believer, as it brings, in one point of view, the identity of Christ in spirit with His suffering people, and, on the other side, His identity with Jehovah.<a name=105:1></a> His being Jehovah is the basis of all hopes that belong to the Jews, and to the saints consequently.<a name=105:2></a> Our Lord's sufferings become the earnest of glory to those that are His.<a name=105:3></a> The triumph of Christ comes to be the pledge of deliverance and blessing to them.<a name=105:4></a> This makes the testimony of His deliverance, when suffering for us, so blessed, because the earnest of ours.<a name=105:5></a> "In the day when I call, answer me speedily.<a name=105:6></a>" The craving of the godly soul in trouble is the Lord's hearing him: this is their anxiety, for otherwise there would be wrath in the case.<a name=105:7></a> Of this the resurrection of Jesus was the great witness.<a name=105:8></a>

		In this psalm our Lord enters into every protracted suffering of His people.<a name=105:9></a> In all His sufferings, as a righteous man on earth, He could say, "I know that thou hearest me always.<a name=105:10></a>" I watch, etc.<a name=105:11></a> -- the very opposite of ease.<a name=105:12></a> Verses 9, 10: I never find the deepest sorrow of our Lord spoken of exclusive of indignation.<a name=105:13></a> "Thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down.<a name=105:14></a>" The lifting up here spoken of was true of Jesus with the Jews.<a name=105:15></a> For what nation is so great?<a name=105:16></a> who hath God so nigh unto them?<a name=105:17></a> etc.<a name=105:18></a> Jesus is looked at as the Messiah, as coming in the flesh, most exalted, as Head of the people, yet He had to be "cast down" for the indignation that was come upon this people.<a name=105:19></a> He never took the headship, but took the casting down.<a name=105:20></a> The Spirit of Christ in us always takes portion with sorrow.<a name=105:21></a> "My days are like a shadow that declineth.<a name=105:22></a>" Then comes the assertion of strength, of all comfort, the perpetuity of Jehovah; "Thou, O Lord, shalt endure; thou shalt arise, and have mercy on Zion," etc.<a name=105:23></a> Here is contrasted the way in which Messiah was cast down in the lowest degree of suffering, and, in the midst of it, the certainty of Jehovah's taking mercy on His people.<a name=105:24></a>

		If Zion be set up, all the nations who disbelieved that it would be set up "shall fear thy name.<a name=106:1></a>" Then comes another positive declaration: He shall appear in His glory.<a name=106:2></a> How Jehovah is to appear brings out the identity of the suffering Messiah with Jehovah.<a name=106:3></a> The people which shall be created, etc.<a name=106:4></a> -- they shall be new creatures then.<a name=106:5></a> Messiah's prayer (verse 17) will be then regarded, and fully answered; it was not apparently regarded during His sufferings on earth.<a name=106:6></a> The great statements in this psalm are, Messiah cast down, but Jehovah faithful and will build up Zion.<a name=106:7></a> He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and will look down from heaven on what takes place on earth.<a name=106:8></a> Then comes in the repetition of the sufferings of Messiah, next His glory, not merely taken in consequence of suffering, but in virtue of His glorious person.<a name=106:9></a> The secret of all our strength is this unfathomable mystery -- Christ's being Jehovah, and His identity with the sufferings of His people.<a name=106:10></a> It is just the portion of the church to know the glory is His, that He is the Jehovah -- God who founded heaven and earth, and to understand how He was on that earth cast down, was bruised, was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief, and to rest in the happy consciousness of the perfect sympathy of Christ in all our trials, in all that in which wrath may appear to us.<a name=106:11></a> In all our sorrows and troubles we must find, whilst under them, wrath, although we know it is chastening in love; it produces in us, not merely the sorrow of the world, but sense of the displeasure of the Lord under them, and we shall be looking out for His hearing our cry, just as a child grieves to see the frown of a tender parent, because of his displeasure shewn in it.<a name=106:12></a>

		Thus should we, not only on account of the trouble it brings us into -- then we are thinking of ourselves instead of God.<a name=106:13></a> The great comfort of the believer is, that the Lord Jesus having passed through all this trial is itself a witness to us of the love of God in them; and thus we are more than conquerors, not in carelessness, knowing that nothing shall separate us from the love of God.<a name=106:14></a> We may ourselves be the occasion of chastisement -- then must there be humbling, but love in it surely.<a name=106:15></a> One learns in Christ, having gone through all,.<a name=106:16></a> the faithfulness of God in all the exercises we may have to pass through.<a name=106:17></a> We (believers) must take everything as coming from God: otherwise we do not give sufficient value to our sufferings, but give value to ourselves in them.<a name=106:18></a> When wicked men cut our Lord down, He took it all as coming from God: "Thou hast cast me down," etc.<a name=106:19></a> Faith always looks to the great source, and not to casual instruments.<a name=106:20></a>

		In the fourth book we see the coming in of God in the way of deliverance very remarkably.<a name=108:15></a> He is bringing in again the "first-begotten into the world," therefore the preface is "Jehovah reigneth.<a name=108:16></a>" The everlasting gospel comes after, but the general announcement and subject of the book is the reign of Jehovah.<a name=108:17></a> Jehovah has never been reigning in the actual exercise of power until this time comes in.<a name=108:18></a> His ways and dealings with men have not been on that footing.<a name=108:19></a> He is King always, of course, but He has not taken the position of reigning over man, either in connection with Adam, or in the giving of promises, or law.<a name=108:20></a> In one sense God has all in His hand, and He says, "do my prophets no harm," but He has never taken His great power and reigned yet.<a name=108:21></a> The patriarchs were patterns of faith, having no possession in the land.<a name=108:22></a> Man was set up as king in David; then because of Israel's failure under the kings, their dominion transferred to the Gentiles, (Nebuchadnezzar).<a name=108:23></a> Power committed to man, there is no knowing what he will do.<a name=108:24></a> Nebuchadnezzar made an image and called on the people to worship it, instead of God, and then put those who owned God into the fire.<a name=108:25></a> When Christ was on earth, things were not set aside, He said, "Give to Caesar the things that are Caesar's.<a name=108:26></a>" Christ became a servant amongst them.<a name=108:27></a> Pilate represents the emperor who has God's appointed authority.<a name=108:28></a>

		GOD'S COMFORTS THE STAY OF THE SOUL -- PSALM 94
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Psalms 90-100 are connected together, and seem to me to describe the dealings of the Lord with the Jews, etc.<a name=114:1></a>, in the latter day, on the earth.<a name=114:2></a> But I am not going to speak of that now.<a name=114:3></a> We may often derive comfort from principles which we find in such portions of the scripture, revealing to us, as they do, God's character, etc.<a name=114:4></a>; but it is important to know the mind of the Spirit in the primary sense, as we shall then be able to discern what God is teaching us through them with a great deal more clearness and certainty.<a name=114:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The two principles which form the basis of what is dwelt on here are, that the workers of iniquity are allowed to lift up their heads and flourish, but that Jehovah is, and will be, Most High for evermore.<a name=114:6></a> There is the clear perception of this throughout.<a name=114:7></a> Under the temporary exaltation and prevalence of wickedness, the godly are in a very tried state, the righteous suffer; but vengeance belongs to God (not to the sufferer) therefore the cry in verses 1, 2.<a name=114:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To such a height are the workers of iniquity allowed to go, that, in the consciousness that Jehovah's throne could not be cast down, the question comes in, "shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which frameth mischief by a law?<a name=114:9></a>" (verse 20).<a name=114:10></a> So Completely has wickedness got place in the earth, that there is a sort of inquiry raised, whether the throne of iniquity could subsist in companionship of judgment with the divine throne.<a name=114:11></a> The answer is, judgment is coming -- "Jehovah our God shall cut them off," verse 23.<a name=114:12></a> Judgment shall return to righteousness in the place of trial and suffering.<a name=114:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The point on which I would dwell a little at present is the consolation of the saints during this time of trial -- God's "comforts.<a name=114:14></a>" In the first place we have the assurance, "Jehovah knoweth the thoughts of men, that they are vanity," verse 11.<a name=114:15></a> Then "Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O Jehovah," etc.<a name=114:16></a> (verse 12, 13).<a name=114:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the pride and purpose of man, it is settled in a word.<a name=114:18></a> The "thoughts of man" are not only inferior to God's wisdom but they are "vanity.<a name=114:19></a>" This settles the whole question.<a name=114:20></a> All that begins and ends in the heart of man is "vanity," and nothing else.<a name=114:21></a> Whatever the state of things around, though there may be a "multitude of thoughts within," as 'what will all this come to?<a name=114:22></a>' 'how will that end?<a name=114:23></a>' and the like -- every barrier we can raise, all our strength, all our weakness, whatever the wave after wave that may flow over us -- Jehovah's thought about it all is, that it is "vanity.<a name=114:24></a>" All is working together to one object -- God's plan, that upon which His heart is set -- the glorification of Jesus, and ours, with Him.<a name=114:25></a> Every thought and every plan of man must therefore be "vanity," because it has not this, God's object, for its object; and God's object always comes to pass.<a name=114:26></a> There cannot be two ends to what is going on.<a name=114:27></a> Let men break their hearts about it, all simply comes to nothing, the end of it is "vanity.<a name=114:28></a>" God's object is, that "all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father.<a name=114:29></a>"

		Take a man of the world -- the shrewdest calculator, the ablest politician, or the greatest statesman: a poor bed-ridden saint is wiser than he, and more sure of having his plans brought about; for the heart of the simplest feeblest saint runs in the same channel with God's; and though the saint has no strength, God has.<a name=115:1></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In this Psalm we find, first, the tumult of the enemies and then, that God has done it.<a name=115:2></a> So with the saint constantly in trial: he sees the work of Satan, then God's hand in it; and he gets blessing.<a name=115:3></a> All the present effect of these dealings of "the wicked" is, "Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O Jehovah, and teachest him out of thy law; that thou mayest give him rest <i>from</i> the days of adversity, until the pit be digged for the wicked.<a name=115:4></a>" The pit is not yet digged, the throne of iniquity is not yet put down.<a name=115:5></a> If, in chastening, the power of the adversary is against us, the Lord's end in it all is, "to give rest in the day of adversity," etc.<a name=115:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I speak not merely of suffering for Christ -- if we are reproached for the name of Christ, it is only for joy and triumph and glory to us; but of those things in which there may be the "multitude of thoughts within," because we see that we have been walking inconsistently and carelessly in Jehovah's ways.<a name=115:7></a> Still it is, "Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O Jehovah," etc.<a name=115:8></a> Jehovah does not chasten willingly, without a needs -- be for it.<a name=115:9></a> And when there has been failure or inconsistency that brings chastisement, He turns the occasion of the chastisement to the working out of the heart's evil that needed to be chastened.<a name=115:10></a> Jehovah in chastening, throws back the heart upon the springs which have been the occasion of the evil.<a name=115:11></a> The soul is hereby laid bare for the application of God's truth to it, that the word may come home with power.<a name=115:12></a> It is taught wherefore it has been chastened; and not only so, but it is brought into the secret of God's heart -- it learns more of His character, who "will not cast off his people, neither forsake his inheritance," verse 14.<a name=115:13></a> What God desires for us, is, not only that we should have privileges conferred upon us, but that we should have fellowship with Himself.<a name=115:14></a> Through these chastenings, the whole framework of the heart is brought into association with God.<a name=115:15></a> And this stablishes and settles it on the certainty of the hope that grace affords.<a name=115:16></a>

		After Psalm 102, which is the centre of book 4, we find the people repassing all the ways and dealings of God, when they gather round Him their centre, the Messiah.<a name=118:7></a> All the blessings cluster round Him in this character of Melchisedec.<a name=118:8></a> Psalm 103 is a review of God's moral dealings with the people; Psalm 104, of dealings with creation, celebrating Jehovah, God of Israel, in connection with creation.<a name=118:9></a> In Psalm 105 we have God's positive, special favour to them as His people, and in Psalm 106 their failure under it.<a name=118:10></a> "Gather us from amongst the heathen" refers to the last day, etc.<a name=118:11></a> There is a summary of all God's dealings with them, as to forgiveness, creation, special favour, and their failure and cry to be brought forth in mercy.<a name=118:12></a>

		There is one remarkable feature to be noticed in these psalms; namely, the manner of their connection with Christ.<a name=118:13></a> Psalm 102 shews the way in which He was the poor man cut off, yet Jehovah; and Psalm 103 begins, "Bless the Lord, O my soul, .<a name=118:14></a>.<a name=118:15></a>.<a name=118:16></a> who forgiveth all thine iniquities, who healeth all thy diseases.<a name=118:17></a>" There is especial interest in seeing how this is connected with Christ in the Gospels.<a name=118:18></a> Jehovah is the One who forgives and heals.<a name=118:19></a> This is just what the Lord does with the paralytic.<a name=118:20></a> It was an example of God's governmental dealings with man.<a name=118:21></a> He healed the palsy, and besides, He forgave the sins.<a name=118:22></a> They say, "Who is this that forgiveth sins also?<a name=118:23></a>" He proved that He was the Jehovah who forgave them and healed their diseases.<a name=118:24></a> The Gospels, while most simple (the first three especially) in many ways, have the greatest depth in them, if you get below the surface.<a name=118:25></a> They shew what He was, if searched into; and it is most blessed to see who He was that thus walked amongst men, going about doing good.<a name=118:26></a> In the Epistles the Holy Ghost gives the explanation of the value of Christ's work, and until I get peace I want that which will settle me on that point; and when settled there, I can turn back and see who He was, and the heart finds more food than even in the Epistles.<a name=118:27></a> We find Christ Himself But there is also much relative to Christ in the Psalms and in special connection with the remnant of Israel.<a name=118:28></a> He calls Himself the Son of man in the passages about the paralytic referred to; but what He did proved Him to be the Jehovah of the Psalms.<a name=118:29></a> We have in them either His own experience; or He is in sympathy with those there (that is, in connection with the remnant).<a name=118:30></a>

		The fifth book has a peculiar bearing, because it rehearses the circumstances of the remnant, after their restoration.<a name=119:1></a> It is their retrospect of all that has gone by.<a name=119:2></a> Hence it begins with this formula (107) "Give thanks unto the Lord, for his mercy endureth for ever.<a name=119:3></a>" That was the set phrase for the celebration of the faithfulness of God in Israel.<a name=119:4></a> David used it when he brought the ark back (1 Chronicles 16); and again they used it when they came from Babylon (Ezra 3).<a name=119:5></a> "Let the redeemed of the Lord say so," etc.<a name=119:6></a> This refers to Israel brought back, and goes back to their history in the wilderness -- deliverance from Egypt; "they that go down to the sea in ships," Psalm 107: 23.<a name=119:7></a> Israel is being brought back; and it ends in God's setting "the poor on high from affliction.<a name=119:8></a>" What we get as a sort of preface to the book is that all these are gathered from different places, in the midst of humbled circumstances.<a name=119:9></a> They are minished and brought low -- enemies are in the land; and the result of all is, that God pours contempt upon the proud, and iniquity in the earth is entirely cleansed.<a name=119:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first place we get, in Psalm 1, the righteous man; and, in Psalm 2, the counsels of God as to Messiah.<a name=124:1></a> Then, in general, Psalms 3-7 are the sufferings of Christ in the remnant, whether from enemies or from a sense of their own state; and in result, Psalm 8 is the Son of man set over all the works of God's hands.<a name=124:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Psalms 9 and 10 we have particulars of God's executing judgment against the heathen in Zion, in favour of the needy; and, in particular, the ways of the wicked one, the man of the earth.<a name=124:3></a> Then follow, in Psalms 11-15, the sentiments and spirit of the remnant -- the moral movements of their heart in this time of trial.<a name=124:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Psalm 16 is the place Christ Himself takes in His dependence, trusting in the time of humiliation, but ending in His joy in God's presence in resurrection.<a name=124:5></a> Psalm 17 is His appeal to right, which ends in His being displayed in glory -- as man, of course; a lower kind of thing, but still a part of His glory.<a name=124:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Psalm 18 the sufferings of Christ are made the centre of all God's ways in Israel, from Egypt to the manifestation of the glory of Messiah.<a name=124:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Psalm 19 is the testimony of creation and of the law; according to the letter of which the remnant presents itself in conscience before God.<a name=124:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Psalm 20 the remnant prophetically see Christ in His day of trouble, and in His sufferings from man; in which God hears Him, in order to His establishment in His royal rights.<a name=124:9></a> In Psalm 21 He is answered with length of days for ever and ever, and excellent majesty; and judges His enemies.<a name=124:10></a> In Psalm 22 He is in sorrow, in which no remnant can enter; in which, through all the concentration of evil from without, He finds the forsaking of God within, instead of answer to His confidence.<a name=124:11></a> But, when He had drunk the whole cup, He was answered in resurrection, and all flows forth in unmingled blessing: first, to the remnant, immediately consequent on His resurrection saluted as "brethren," with whom He unites Himself in spirit, as He says, "In the midst of the congregation will I praise thee"; then, to all Israel; then, to all the ends of the world, the testimony of that which is done going down to other generations.<a name=124:12></a>

		In Psalm 23 He takes the place of the sheep on earth; in Psalm 24 He is saluted as "Jehovah of Hosts," and "King of glory.<a name=125:1></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Psalms 25-28 are, in general, the exercises of the renewed heart (in the remnant always): confidence in the Lord; consciousness of integrity through grace; consciousness of sin; and earnest desire not to be drawn away with the wicked, counting on the Lord's having called them to seek His face.<a name=125:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Psalm 29 is God's voice (not the still small voice) the answer to it all.<a name=125:3></a> Psalms 30 and 31 are enjoyment in the sense of this interference of God (still though in the trouble).<a name=125:4></a> Psalm 32 is forgiveness and guidance (still in the remnant).<a name=125:5></a> in Psalm 33 creation and the counsels of God in favour of His people give confidence.<a name=125:6></a> In Psalm 34 what God has been for them in their sufferings gives confidence.<a name=125:7></a> In Psalms 34-39 we find them in the presence of the power and prosperity of the wicked, with the sense of having deserved judgments and having been under chastening, though their cry is to the Lord who chastened them.<a name=125:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Psalm 40 is Christ undertaking the accomplishment of the divine will in perfect obedience: His perfectness shewn in waiting, etc.<a name=125:9></a> In Psalm 41 which is the last psalm of the book, we see all the humiliation and bitterness to which He exposed Himself in the accomplishment of it; but in which He is assured to be set before God's face for ever.<a name=125:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a very distinct principle brought out in the Psalms, that while in connection with the Jews, yet the nation is not the thing owned.<a name=125:11></a> The distinction is made by moral character, and not by nation.<a name=125:12></a> It is a certain elect remnant in the midst of the mass that is owned, of whom Christ becomes the representative; Psalm 1.<a name=125:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As a general principle the government of God is looked for, and that that government will sanction and establish the righteous, in contrast with the ungodly.<a name=125:14></a> Another principle comes up -- the counsels of God as to His Anointed, in spite of the heathen who rise up against them.<a name=125:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Psalm 2.<a name=125:16></a> As soon, however, as we get these principles laid down, we find that, outwardly, it is not happening so at all.<a name=125:17></a> Hence the discussion of this question in the Psalms that follow.<a name=125:18></a>

		Psalm 3 is faith in what Jehovah is.<a name=126:1></a> In verse 7 he sees prophetically that He has done it; therefore he gives praise.<a name=126:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Psalm 4 is dependence in calling on God.<a name=126:3></a> Verse 3, the godly are marked out, not the nation.<a name=126:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Psalms 5 and 6 are a great deal more the remnant.<a name=126:5></a> In Psalm 5 there is more sense of the evil that is pressing on them; in verse 9 Christ's judgment of the then condition of the wicked.<a name=126:6></a> It goes on to the last days.<a name=126:7></a> Psalm 6 is quite in the latter day in Israel; it is a question of cutting off.<a name=126:8></a> Verse 3, "How long!<a name=126:9></a>" is the spirit of prophecy in the remnant.<a name=126:10></a> (See Isaiah 6.<a name=126:11></a>) The cessation of this is indicated in Psalm 74, there being no one who knew "How long.<a name=126:12></a>" They were in circumstances like as if cast off for ever; and faith, knowing that it cannot be so, says, "How long!<a name=126:13></a>" Verse 4; in the psalms in which the remnant speaks, mercy comes before righteousness.<a name=126:14></a> In Psalm 4, where it is more the Lord Himself, righteousness comes before mercy.<a name=126:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Psalms 3-7 It is much more introductory, and certain general principles.<a name=126:16></a> It is Messiah who first speaks, because He has first fully taken, nay, He alone could rightly take apart the place of the remnant, as apart from, and in contrast with, the people.<a name=126:17></a> Others had felt it -- as having His Spirit, and, as prophets, had portrayed it in Him -- but He alone could rightly take it by intrinsic righteousness.<a name=126:18></a> Yet in Him it was as forced to it; that is, this righteousness forced out the wickedness in the others, and He wept over Jerusalem when it was done; but then He entered into all that concerned Israel, according to the purpose, love, and revelation of God.<a name=126:19></a> The Psalms are the perfect display of all that a divinely perfect heart in the circumstances could feel of, and as to, the relationships of God with Israel, and Israel with God.<a name=126:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Psalm 9 is more the heathen-man; Psalm 10 is more the wicked one among the Jews.<a name=126:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Psalms 11-41 are the development of faith in Christ, or the remnant as associated during the time of tribulation; but before the last half-week.<a name=126:22></a> Therefore Psalms 9, 10 come in as a general preface.<a name=126:23></a> Psalm 11: 2.<a name=126:24></a> It is not "privily" in last half-week.<a name=126:25></a> Verse 4 is the answer to verse 3.<a name=126:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Psalm 12 is the holy wisdom of owning Jehovah.<a name=126:27></a> In verse 6 the words of the Lord are a stay, when everyone speaks vanity with his neighbour.<a name=126:28></a> In verse 7 the second "them" should be "him.<a name=126:29></a>"

		In Psalm 16 Christ comes in to give its full character to hope and faith.<a name=127:1></a> This psalm is like a stake in the midst of all these psalms.<a name=127:2></a> The moment we get Christ, we get the spirit of calmness and grace.<a name=127:3></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Psalm 16 we have Christ's own joy in God; Jehovah shews Him the path of life, and at His right hand are pleasures for evermore.<a name=127:7></a> Psalm 17.<a name=127:8></a> In presence of the wicked and the prosperity of the men of this world He beholds God's face in righteousness, and is satisfied in waking up after His image.<a name=127:9></a> Most interesting is it to find that we have what is analogous in the church -- the taking up for its own joy, and the display in glory as the reward of righteousness.<a name=127:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Psalm 18: 4-6 is evidently the death of Christ.<a name=127:11></a> The words may have an application, used hyperbolically, to Israel in Egypt.<a name=127:12></a> Verse 15 is the Red Sea.<a name=127:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Psalm 19.<a name=127:14></a> The creation testimony is used as a figure of that now given by the gospel, inasmuch as it is universal.<a name=127:15></a> The testimony had been given of God, whether man saw it or not.<a name=127:16></a> (See Romans 1.<a name=127:17></a>) They did not see it as we find, Verses 12, 13, they are kept in detail, and so kept from the great apostasy.<a name=127:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Psalms 20, 21, we see human enemies, and judgment, but in Psalm 22 divine wrath and perfect grace.<a name=127:19></a> In verse 12, bulls, that is, violent men, who do their own will; in verse 16, dogs, that is shameless ones.<a name=127:20></a> In verse 21, the lion's mouth, that is, Satan's power over death.<a name=127:21></a> Verse 22 is the congregation, that is, the remnant, which afterwards became the church; only here looked at as the remnant of Israel.<a name=127:22></a> In verse 25 is "The great congregation," as in Solomon's day.<a name=127:23></a> Verse 30, is the remnant who pass through the trouble.<a name=127:24></a> Verse 31, is the millennial people.<a name=127:25></a>

		Psalm 23.<a name=127:26></a> Thesis -- Jehovah is my Shepherd; I shall not want.<a name=127:27></a> It is not -- He has given me good things, and I shall not want; but Jehovah is my Shepherd, etc.<a name=127:28></a> Verse 3 is the weakness of man, which needed restoring.<a name=127:29></a> <i>We</i> need restoring, because of sin as well as weakness.<a name=127:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Psalm 24: 3, 4.<a name=127:31></a> "Who?<a name=127:32></a>" Verses 7-10 shew the King of glory; verse 6, the remnant coming in when the earth is the Lord's.<a name=127:33></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The second book begins not with Christ, but with the condition of the remnant; and hence has more for its subject the facts of the latter day, Israel being driven out.<a name=129:1></a> It is not going through all these states of soul, so that Christ might be brought in.<a name=129:2></a> It is like the position, when Christ went out to a place called Ephraim.<a name=129:3></a> (John 11: 54.<a name=129:4></a>) There was a kind of hoping for good, from the multitude before; but now He has done with the wicked, and come out.<a name=129:5></a> So now it is not Jehovah, but God.<a name=129:6></a> One is cast more simply on God.<a name=129:7></a> He is not trusting in the relationship, but in God, in the nature of Elohim.<a name=129:8></a>

		CHAPTER 7
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this seventh chapter we have another aspect of Wisdom's ways.<a name=139:1></a> It is not open wickedness in which the will is active against which it directs its remonstrances; it speaks of the snares laid for those who have no intention to do evil, but whose lusts and passions lay them open to those snares.<a name=139:2></a> Hence the soul is called upon to be previously diligently filled with the precepts and counsels of wisdom, that it may be in no way taken in them.<a name=139:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is a very important point.<a name=139:4></a> It is not sufficient (how often has the Christian found it!<a name=139:5></a>) not to have any intention to do evil, nor even to have the intention to do right.<a name=139:6></a> We are in a world of snares and temptations.<a name=139:7></a> We have to watch and pray, lest we enter into temptation -- to have the soul filled with the divine things of wisdom, and the thoughts of wisdom guiding the mind and the path, so that the allurements of evil and Satan's wiles take no hold upon us.<a name=139:8></a> The mind lives in another sphere.<a name=139:9></a> It is indeed another nature to which evil is offensive, and which detects it in the allurement itself, and deals with that as evil, instead of being.<a name=139:10></a> attracted by it.<a name=139:11></a> The precepts and light of divine wisdom fill and guide the thoughts; and evil is evil -- is contrary to the state of the soul, walking in lowliness and obedience, not as fools but as wise, simple concerning evil indeed, but wise concerning that which is good.<a name=139:12></a> The words of counsel, implying, as we have seen, obedience and subjection of heart, are to be kept, and the commandments of a father laid up.<a name=139:13></a> And they are to be kept as well as laid up, and treasured, delighted in, kept before one's mind.<a name=139:14></a>, on the fingers, and tables of the heart, and confessed and owned as that with which we are of kin, to keep us from the flatteries and allurements of sin.<a name=139:15></a>

		The young man void of understanding went, notes the way of her house.<a name=139:16></a> It was not a deliberate purpose, as verse 21 shews; but the path of wisdom and her precepts would never have led him there -- would have led and kept him elsewhere.<a name=139:17></a> He followed at least the idleness of his heart.<a name=139:18></a> This is a solemn warning.<a name=139:19></a> Nor is there light on this path.<a name=139:20></a> He was not walking in that light in which a man does not stumble.<a name=139:21></a> Nor is the conscience ever really good there.<a name=139:22></a> It is not an actually bad conscience, but a good conscience is always in the presence of God.<a name=139:23></a> "He that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in God.<a name=139:24></a>" Here there were passions ready to be ensnared, without a safeguard; and a conscience which darkness suited better than light, which was not walking in the light; idleness of will which had shame, in a measure, of its own ways.<a name=139:25></a> It was not a path in the broad daylight of God.<a name=139:26></a> And, oh, how great a thing it is, and how blessed a thing!<a name=139:27></a> Look at the path of Jesus: where was that?<a name=139:28></a> We have greatly to seek this.<a name=139:29></a>

		But now we have the boldness of a hardened conscience -- a terrible thing.<a name=140:1></a> A defiled one with a broken heart Christ can meet; but a bold one is a shocking thing.<a name=140:2></a> There is no home to such a heart.<a name=140:3></a> But the idleness of passion is no safeguard against its ways.<a name=140:4></a> It can flatter, awaken lust, be ready to minister to it to win its ways.<a name=140:5></a> It reckons on fear in the unhardened, though it has none.<a name=140:6></a> It has its means, however, false, of guarding against it; for one is a mean thing, even if hardened.<a name=140:7></a> There was no "good man" at all.<a name=140:8></a> It was naked vice; but stolen waters are sweet, though sin fills with fear.<a name=140:9></a> And the idle soul is caught in snares its will did not seek; but it was none the less the path of death.<a name=140:10></a> Nor is it the only snare the idle soul may meet.<a name=140:11></a> The soul that does not watch and pray (that is not filled with wisdom's ways and wisdom's thoughts, kept by God's presence) will meet temptation somewhere.<a name=140:12></a> Still, here it is the snare of the strange woman.<a name=140:13></a> Her house is the way to hell.<a name=140:14></a> She has cast down many wounded, and strong men are all her slain.<a name=140:15></a> It is not human strength that resists temptation and passion; and such temptation has been the ruin of many who in this world were mighty, and even morally mighty.<a name=140:16></a> They have fallen under the snare, and were ruined; those who otherwise boast themselves have through this been weakness, and brought to ruin.<a name=140:17></a> The wise man presses it on him who had ears to hear.<a name=140:18></a>

		CHAPTER 8
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Wisdom is not in this world simplicity, but leads us into it.<a name=141:1></a> Simplicity is the blessed result in the highest way, when God is all to the new nature.<a name=141:2></a> But God is wise in His ways in ordering all things, and we are now in a scene of evil, and a complication of received good and actual evil in will and fact, which needs for him who would go aright a path which the vulture's eye hath not seen.<a name=141:3></a> In truth there is none in the world in itself.<a name=141:4></a> Where all is morally wrong and departed from God, there can be no right path.<a name=141:5></a> Adam did not want a path.<a name=141:6></a> As to him he had only to stay where he was.<a name=141:7></a> When we have gone wrong, and are driven out by God, and so need a path, none can be found.<a name=141:8></a> There is none.<a name=141:9></a> But God deals with this scene -- now with man in it, hereafter with the scene itself, and has a path and result which was before the worlds, and which wisdom points out to us, calling men into it.<a name=141:10></a> Where shall wisdom be found, and where is the path of understanding?<a name=141:11></a> It is not to be found in the land of the living.<a name=141:12></a> Destruction and death say we have heard the fame thereof with our ears.<a name=141:13></a> So they have.<a name=141:14></a> They tell us the vanity of all the scene we are in, and, above all, of man at the head of it, the sorest place of all.<a name=141:15></a> But it is only negative.<a name=141:16></a> This is an immense truth, that there is no way for living man fallen from God.<a name=141:17></a> This is what is described in the book of Ecclesiastes.<a name=141:18></a> Man under the sun, his will works.<a name=141:19></a> What can his will, multiplied in the contentions of many, do?<a name=141:20></a> But God understandeth the way thereof, and He knoweth the place thereof He ordered creation, but to man He said, The fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.<a name=141:21></a> This, as Ecclesiastes says, is the whole of man.<a name=141:22></a> That book does not go farther, and it is a deep and immense instruction to get this by itself, the position and condition of man as such ascertained, bringing God and responsibility to him, without reaching Him, but looking at man as he is here, and without revelation, but knowing good and evil, accompanied by the declaration of judgment.<a name=141:23></a>

		Proverbs takes a wider sphere, because it is occupied with wisdom, not with man simply as he is.<a name=142:1></a> Hence we have always God in Ecclesiastes (save the fear of Jehovah at the end), Jehovah in Proverbs.<a name=142:2></a> The sphere we live in is one of a perverse will in man, who will not have God, but a knowledge of right and wrong in himself, of the difference of right and wrong, in a scene where nature retains abundant marks of a wise and good Creator, of almighty power, yet in this its lower part in a state of ruin and corruption, away from God, and in what man knows to be corruption about Him too; so that, when he has not revelation, that is, the word, he is fain, in hopeless subjection to what is false, to rear his altar to an unknown God.<a name=142:3></a> Such instinctive knowledge there must be as makes him feel that he knows nothing of Him -- a sad condition for a responsible soul.<a name=142:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Wisdom, the word of God, comes into this scene, shews what it is, reveals God in it, the way of truth, but that word shews it existing in God before the world was.<a name=142:5></a> It looks back to creative wisdom, but to a purpose then set up which will be fulfilled; but it deals with what it meets with, and shews with divine light what is the scene and state of things of which I have spoken.<a name=142:6></a> Its utterances are the truth, and reveal withal the counsels of God.<a name=142:7></a> Christ was, and of course is, this wisdom, but He is more, for He reveals God Himself; and then comes in necessarily another thing -- grace and truth come by Jesus Christ.<a name=142:8></a> This last we have not here.<a name=142:9></a> It was foretold and prophesied of, but could not be till the Lord Himself came, and effectually for us only when redemption was accomplished, and He had glorified God.<a name=142:10></a> (Compare Titus 1: 1-33; 2 Timothy 1: 9, 10.<a name=142:11></a>) But we have the general truth of the activity of God's testimony, which, after all, is grace, His dealing with the consciences of men, and wisdom in the creation, and in a general way that His thoughts and purposes of divine delight rested in the sons of men, accomplished so perfectly in Christ's incarnation, proclaimed so blessedly in the angels' song, "Glory to God in the highest, on earth peace, good pleasure in men"; but here, too, wondrously set forth, shewing the dealing in truth by wisdom with men, and the unspeakable testimony of where His delight was before the world was wisdom having its delight where God's delight in eternity was.<a name=142:12></a> Its delight was in the sons of men.<a name=142:13></a> Now we say, "Christ the wisdom of God and the power of God.<a name=142:14></a>"

		Understanding puts forth her voice, as wisdom comprehended all, and brought divine light to bear on it, Understanding discovered all.<a name=144:1></a> Verses 2 and 3 shew remarkably the character of this testimony.<a name=144:2></a> She meets man where he is, lifts up her voice above the roar and confusion of man's restless activities in this world, meets him in the throng, and puts herself forward in the highway of passage to bring in the light of God, and His claim on man for his good.<a name=144:3></a> She summons man's ear to hear, and think of something besides the urging of his own will and the turbid stream of his passions and earthly hopes.<a name=144:4></a> "To you, O men, I call, and my voice is to the sons of man.<a name=144:5></a>" So Christ, the life, was the light of man.<a name=144:6></a> Christ, though He did not lift up His voice in the streets, but only to be so much the more heard of all that had cars to hear, yet sent it on the housetops by His apostles, Himself the perfect subject and wisdom's self, rather than the proclaimer of it, yet sowed the word.<a name=144:7></a> Christ, I say, was this wisdom displayed in subjective perfection in this world.<a name=144:8></a> Every word He uttered was a part of it, and the right part when He uttered it.<a name=144:9></a> How He discovered all I need not say.<a name=144:10></a> He did not learn wisdom partially by experience, as that which He had not (though as true man He grew in it); but was that which experience is to learn.<a name=144:11></a> Sorrows He learnt for us, difficulties, opposition; but He was wisdom in the midst of it.<a name=144:12></a> However, God in active grace brings this to bear on the conscience and hearts of men -- says, "He that hath cars to hear, let him hear.<a name=144:13></a>" The word was proclaimed, on the top of the high places, in the view of men, in the thronged resorts of men, and where every one must enter that belonged to a human dwelling-place or home.<a name=144:14></a> And her address was to men.<a name=144:15></a> God's word and wisdom are formed for and expressed to them.<a name=144:16></a> When it was there in life, "the life was the light of men"; theirs in divine counsels, and adapted to their condition.<a name=144:17></a>

		SONG OF SOLOMON
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we examine the Psalms, or even the prophets, with a view to ascertain the character or circumstances of the residue of Israel in the latter days, we shall find, after their undergoing some deceptions through professed friendship, a distressed and oppressed people.<a name=157:1></a> The fowls summer upon them, and the beasts of the earth winter upon them; Isaiah 18: 6.<a name=157:2></a> That is the state of the nation when the Assyrian shall be pressing them from without and the beast oppressing them within.<a name=157:3></a> At the centre of their nationality, and where their hearts have sought rest, will be trouble such as never was since there was a nation, and never will be again: the time when God is making short work upon the earth.<a name=157:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Though this will be in the nation at large, the effect on the wicked and on the saints will be very different.<a name=157:5></a> The nation at large will have joined with the beast and acquiesced in idolatry.<a name=157:6></a> Another, come in his own name, they will have received.<a name=157:7></a> The unclean spirit of idolatry, with seven others worse, will have entered into them.<a name=157:8></a> They have given up their God, rejected their Messiah, received the Antichrist, and what have they when oppression comes?<a name=157:9></a> "They shall fret themselves, and curse their king and their God, and look upward.<a name=157:10></a> And they shall look unto the earth and behold trouble and darkness, dimness of anguish, and they shall be driven to darkness.<a name=157:11></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But we have to do more particularly with the remnant attached to Israel, to Israel's hopes, and Israel's relationship with Jehovah, but awakened to the sense of the evil that is going on, and suffering on all hands from it where they have not fled.<a name=157:12></a> The Spirit and word of God are working in their hearts.<a name=157:13></a> They remember the promise to the people as God's people; they seek faithfulness to Jehovah, and are only for that reason oppressed and driven out, hated by unfaithful Israel and cruelly oppressed by her oppressors, but brought to the sense of the nation's and therein their own sins, grieved over its ruin, and seeing approaching judgments and God's hand already on them in sore chastisement.<a name=157:14></a> They would hope yet in Jehovah and expect Messiah, though smitten into the place of dragons and finding it hard to count on One against whom they have sinned, and whose hand is out against them and to reckon on promises when all seems dark.<a name=157:15></a> Still the promises are there, and God will certainly set His King on His holy hill of Zion.<a name=157:16></a> From Deuteronomy 32 onward, the prophets had predicted this state of things; so that, dark and terrible as it is, and humanly speaking, excluding hope, there was that, even in the very threats, which sustained hope.<a name=157:17></a>

		This state of things the Psalms meet, and, as we have often seen in commenting on them, furnish a divine expression for the hopes and sorrows of these exercised hearts.<a name=158:1></a> It is only the great principles of these which I would now advert to, to bring out more distinctly the different character of the Song of Solomon, and what this will furnish to the hearts and faith of the remnant.<a name=158:2></a> There are two great principles characteristic of their state in the midst of all their sorrows: firstly, integrity; secondly, trust in Jehovah.<a name=158:3></a> In these the Spirit of Christ leads them, Himself perfect in both and by His grace enabling them, in the expressions furnished them in these Psalms, to express their confidence in spite of all their failure, which rendered it more difficult than even the deep waters they were passing through.<a name=158:4></a> This very integrity, and the operation of the Spirit of Christ in them, leads them, however necessarily, to the confession of sin and long failure even to blood-guiltiness.<a name=158:5></a> It is remarkable to see in this way how declaration of integrity, and confession of sins, are found together; so with Job, so even with Peter.<a name=158:6></a> Hence also, in looking to God, mercy always comes before righteousness in their thoughts.<a name=158:7></a> He had shut them up in unbelief that they might be objects of mercy.<a name=158:8></a> No doubt God was righteous in fulfilling His promises; but they must get into the true and right place to have them accomplished, the place where the interpreter, one among a thousand, could put them.<a name=158:9></a> And this interpreter is just the Spirit of Christ in the Psalms.<a name=158:10></a> He shews them the place of uprightness in confessing their sin; then they can look for mercy, and so righteousness.<a name=158:11></a> All these are the moral dealings of Jehovah, most instructive, and most interesting.<a name=158:12></a> The Psalms, and the Prophets too, add, that it will be through the intervention of Messiah, and the Prophets at any rate tell us plainly it will be under the new covenant.<a name=158:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the Song of Solomon seems to me to shew us something further -- the drawing out, where the soul is taught of God (an effect realised in some hidden ones, while revealed and open for all), of the soul of the waiting few, into affections here figuratively presented, and the revelation of Messiah's devoted love for the people; for Jerusalem, if you please, as the centre of it, over which He wept, when in its folly it rejected Him, so that the humble and instructed heart should have the consciousness of it, and confide in it, though not yet revealed.<a name=158:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=159>[Page 159]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It begins with a recognition of the blessedness of Messiah's love.<a name=159:1></a> His name, from the graces in Him, is as ointment poured forth, and He is loved by the uncorrupted ones -- those, I suppose, who have guarded themselves from idolatry and corruption, the same class exactly as in Revelation 14, these evidently therefore also while waiting for Christ have suffered in a certain sense like Him.<a name=159:2></a> Next the bride (Jerusalem) looks to be drawn by Messiah, but says "we," because she really represents all the faithful.<a name=159:3></a> The King now appears, King Messiah.<a name=159:4></a> He loves Jerusalem intimately.<a name=159:5></a> This is valued.<a name=159:6></a> It is the upright ones who love Him.<a name=159:7></a> We have seen this character of the remnant.<a name=159:8></a> Verses 5, 6, tell the tale of Jerusalem, of Jacob's long persecution and desolation.<a name=159:9></a> The sun has looked upon her, the heat of trial.<a name=159:10></a> Her place was to be a keeper of nations for fruit; she had not kept her own vineyard.<a name=159:11></a> Next, in verse 7, she would not be anywhere but with Messiah's flocks, not be like a dissolute wanderer with others than He.<a name=159:12></a> The paths marked out by those, whom God owned as guided and guides, the testimony among God's people, were to lead her.<a name=159:13></a> This brings her to Messiah's own testimony of His delight in her; and her consciousness that thus grace is drawn forth in her (verse 12).<a name=159:14></a> What an image of this, suited to the time, was Mary's act, which Judas blamed!<a name=159:15></a> This is a kind of introductory statement, which gives us the aspects in which they stand, and their position, so as to recognise the bride, her place, and the bridegroom.<a name=159:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the action and effect of it begins.<a name=159:17></a> Chapter 2.<a name=159:18></a> The bride takes her place, and the bridegroom owns only her.<a name=159:19></a> She is the lily, the rest thorns (verse 2).<a name=159:20></a> It is under Christ she finds herself, she owns Him as the true blessed fruit-bearer.<a name=159:21></a> And His shadow protects her, and she delights in it, and His fruit is her joy.<a name=159:22></a> Jerusalem and Israel are restored under Messiah, delight in Him, are sheltered under Him.<a name=159:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we find how much more we have than in the Psalms, the heart's devoted confidence, that His love is the spring of delight, her joy, and overpowering her with blessing.<a name=159:24></a> He, too, rests in His love, and in her heart she weighs and estimates the value of His love; all her delight is in His resting in His love (see Zephaniah 3: 17): 'he please' (verse 7) I doubt not is right, though I had elsewhere supposed it otherwise.<a name=159:25></a> The remnant are entering by faith into the joy Messiah will have in His bridegroom -- love to them, and express their own rest of heart in this.<a name=159:26></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Remark here what follows, for it is a key to the bearing of his: "The voice of my beloved, behold he cometh.<a name=160:1></a>" This connection is not accidental, we have the form of verse 7, also in chapters 3: 5, and 8: 4, and each time it is followed by His coming, but with progress.<a name=160:2></a> Here Messiah comes revealing Himself.<a name=160:3></a> After chapter 3: 8, He comes crowned as King Messiah, the Son of David, Prince of peace, crowned in the day of His espousals, as His mother's (Israel's) heart crowns Him.<a name=160:4></a> After chapter 8: 3, 4, the bride is coming.<a name=160:5></a> back out of the wilderness with Him, leaning on her beloved.<a name=160:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here we return to the first principle of blessing stated in chapter 2: 3: she was raised up under the apple-tree; there she was brought forth.<a name=160:7></a> It was not under Moses, not under the old covenant, that Israel or Jerusalem could truly find their blessing, but under Christ; still less was it under Egypt: Christ was the source, the tree of blessing and life to her.<a name=160:8></a> Hence -- to complete this part of the connection of thought -- instead of vineyards trusted to her, and her not keeping her own, Christ, as royal Prince of peace, has a vineyard at Baalhamon, a difficult word.<a name=160:9></a> At any rate, it is now Solomon, Messiah Himself, who has the vineyard.<a name=160:10></a> I am disposed to think it refers to Christ's universal dominion over the earth, the peoples, a vineyard which will now bear its fruit.<a name=160:11></a> But there was a special vineyard now, once not kept, which was now before the spouse -- Israel, who through grace would now diligently keep her vineyard; her vineyard was before her.<a name=160:12></a> The song closes the remark with the desire that the Bridegroom would make haste.<a name=160:13></a> The companions hearkened to His voice for her.<a name=160:14></a> It was the desire of the upright ones, but in the character of spouse she prays to hear it.<a name=160:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All this points out, I think, two things.<a name=160:16></a> One is the way faith, in those whose hearts have been opened, enters into the perfect delight of Christ's love in the blessing of Israel, specially of Jerusalem.<a name=160:17></a> The anticipative sense of this is here furnished to draw out and encourage this faith.<a name=160:18></a> It is not the prophetic statement of moral principles, however deeply important in connection with Jehovah's dealings with Israel they may be, but the sense of bridegroom -- love which Messiah has for His people, for the people and city He has chosen; not as stones of course, but as the seat of election.<a name=160:19></a> (Compare Psalm 132: 13, 14 -- indeed the whole Psalm.<a name=160:20></a>)
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=161>[Page 161]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next, it is only the anticipation of faith: for every time that she realises it, and looks to the Bridegroom's resting undisturbed in His love, immediately follows the thought of His coming.<a name=161:1></a> She did not actually possess Him.<a name=161:2></a> This, as we have seen, is progressive.<a name=161:3></a> In the end of chapter 2 there is the consciousness that the time was come; the Lord's grace was causing blessing to spring forth and bud.<a name=161:4></a> (Compare Psalm 102.<a name=161:5></a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The various exercises of heart connected with it I do not notice in detail -- true affection, yet failure.<a name=161:6></a> I only remark that the Bridegroom speaks to her, the bride of Him: this is just.<a name=161:7></a> Christ can give His approval to those He loves.<a name=161:8></a> The saint, Jew or heavenly, enjoys His love, can describe His excellencies with delight, but does not take upon him to tell them to Him.<a name=161:9></a> There is progress also in the consciousness of the character of relationship.<a name=161:10></a> As has been noticed elsewhere, first "My beloved is mine, and I am his" (chapter 2: 16); this is the first consciousness of relationship.<a name=161:11></a> "We have found him.<a name=161:12></a>" He owns, indeed, His beloved (were it not so, there would be no comfort); and He enjoys with delight her beauty; but the first thought is, "He is mine.<a name=161:13></a>" It is not till after many exercises, failure on her part, and assurance how precious she was to Him, that she says with calmer spirit, "I am my Beloved's," I belong to Him, though the other part remains true, with deeper feeling too, for His worth and title is more felt and better known, and in it all He is ours, whatever His title over us, and still His joy is in the beauty and graces of His people.<a name=161:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, after this, we have not exercises, but the expression of the Bridegroom's thoughts -- His dove, His undefiled, is but one: there may be nations, and many more or less connected with Him, but His Beloved is one; Israel only on earth has this place.<a name=161:15></a> But, when He so looks at it, soon He is carried on their hearts.<a name=161:16></a> He goes down to see the fruits of the valley, whether His vineyard bore its fruits, at least whether it flourished, and that which represented true faithfulness, as He delighted in it (as the pomegranates on Aaron's robe), was budding forth -- Israel shewing in its humiliation the breaking forth of the signs of living fruit.<a name=161:17></a> Or ever He was aware, His soul set Him on the chariots of His willing people; for such is the force of Aminadab, as in Psalm 110: 3, and Psalm 47: 9, translated princes (the <i>Nadibim)</i> of the people.<a name=161:18></a> Hence Israel becomes immediately as two armies, or as Mahanaim the hosts of God of old.<a name=161:19></a><a href="#161:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> When all this has taken place, and the Bridegroom has told her how He estimates her beauty, she says again in the due sense how all ought to be His, and what a blessing it was to be so in one's own right place, "I am my Beloved's.<a name=161:20></a>" He is that, her Beloved, but she is His, then all her heart could delight in "His desire is towards me.<a name=161:21></a>"

		Now this was the thought into which Israel had to grow up.<a name=162:1></a> Exercises of Israel, right ones, we have in the Psalms; but this thought of Messiah's delight in her is scarcely found there; but they ought to feel it.<a name=162:2></a> It opens out a new and most interesting element of their condition, of what grace furnishes them with, that all the feelings that grace can give may be then divinely given to them, and they drawn on into this blessed confidence, and knowledge of Messiah.<a name=162:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It seems to me that, not merely particular images or expressions, but that the whole structure of this, I admit, mysterious and remarkable poem points to Israel, to the remnant of Jerusalem, as the centre of all this in the latter day and (as I have said) gives a further apprehension of what is provided and in store, for the remnant, than any other portion of scripture does; though we have seen it connect itself with many expressions in the Psalms, which confirm this interpretation of it.<a name=162:4></a> It has seemed to me that the passages I have referred to, with their combination, give a distinctive clue to the intention of the whole book.<a name=162:5></a>

		GENERAL REMARKS ON THE PROPHETIC WORD
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		1. OLD TESTAMENT
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is at the outset a great distinction to make between the prophets.<a name=163:1></a> Some wrote before the captivity and called the Jews to repentance, as hoping that they might still heed the warning, whatever the solemn light on the future judgment, but with blessing at last.<a name=163:2></a> The others wrote a little during or after the captivity on the basis of the judgment of God.<a name=163:3></a> Isaiah is in the first class, Jeremiah and Ezekiel being transitional; Daniel is in the second, as well as Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi.<a name=163:4></a> Jonah stands alone as a sort of final testimony to the Gentiles while Israel was still owned as God's people.<a name=163:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		ISAIAH prophesies in general of all the hopes of the people of God and of the nations in their relations with Israel.<a name=163:6></a> The book is divided into two very distinct parts, the first ending with chapter 35, the second beginning with chapter 40, and an historical portion forming a parenthesis between those two parts.<a name=163:7></a> The former part contains the judgment of God on Israel and on the nations; the latter presents the consolation of Israel by sovereign grace and in view of their guilt, first by idolatry, next by the rejection of Messiah, who comes again for their deliverance to the glory of God.<a name=163:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 1 prophesies about Jerusalem; chapter 2 is the judging of the nations in relationship with the Jews; chapters 3 and 4 develop yet more the grounds of the judgment and its divine character and result; as chapter 5 sets forth Israel's sin and ruin, notwithstanding all the goodness and painstaking of God from the first.<a name=163:9></a> In chapter 6 we see a kind of introduction which gives us the character of prophecy as to the Jews only.<a name=163:10></a><a href="#163:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> The prophecy of chapter 7 does not close till chapter 9: 7.<a name=163:11></a> It divides into two sections: from chapter 7 we learn of Immanuel, from chapter 8 of Immanuel's land.<a name=163:12></a> Then commences a new subject at chapter 9: 8, or rather a resumption of what began in chapter 5, which terminates with chapter 12.<a name=163:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#163:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>Chapter 6 presents the general character of the prophecy. Ahaz is about to accomplish the apostasy of the family of David by building an idolatrous altar. Before this happens, the glory of Christ is revealed; by the same the moral state of the people is entirely condemned and judgment pronounced. The fulfilment of the sentence is suspended until they have rejected Christ Himself, as we see in John 12. The promise of a remnant is revealed at the intercession of the prophet.

		There is here a principle of intelligence for prophecy, to see how we can employ the passages put in the mouth of the Jews.<a name=192:13></a> In chapter 53: 1-4 it is the Jews who esteemed Christ "smitten of God and afflicted.<a name=192:14></a>" They said if He were the Son of God, let Him come down from the cross.<a name=192:15></a> Not so the believer, who enters into the enjoyment of the fruits of His suffering.<a name=192:16></a> "He was wounded for our transgressions, bruised for our iniquities.<a name=192:17></a>" "Jehovah hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.<a name=192:18></a>" It remains true that He died for the Jews as an elect nation, but also to gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.<a name=192:19></a> These in the name of Jesus can say, that God caused the iniquities of us all to meet on Him.<a name=192:20></a> But Gentiles as such cannot say, "We did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted"; as grafted on the olive, they can now say what Israel will say by-and-by.<a name=192:21></a> The church can say more, for on our behalf Jesus sits on the throne, not of David, but of His Father.<a name=192:22></a> We shall sit on Christ's throne, but not on the throne of David; to it we have no right whatever, not being of David's lineage.<a name=192:23></a> But we shall be seated on the more elevated throne of our Lord as the glorified Son of man.<a name=192:24></a> We are one with Christ, the coming King, and shall reign with Him, kings and priests to God, even His Father.<a name=192:25></a> In this sense it is not for us to say, like Israel, "Unto us a child is born," because we shall not be subjects of the kingdom, but co-heirs with Christ the King, not the people reigned over, but kings reigning with Him.<a name=192:26></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We have seen from chapter 28 the special circumstances of the Jews in the last days, terminating as always in the introduction of the Messiah.<a name=229:1></a> Here in chapter 33 we see judgment fall on the last enemy of Israel (it would seem the Gog of Ezekiel); then in chapter 34 on all nations of which Edom is the scene, followed by the unparalleled sketch of the earth's blessing, and joy, and prosperity under Messiah's reign in Zion, when "the last end of the indignation" is closed.<a name=229:2></a> Therefore in the midst of the prophecy is found introduced the history of Hezekiah menaced by the Assyrian and his deadly sickness turned, as a type of Messiah and the power of resurrection, and the destruction of the last mighty foe of Israel in the last days, but not without the captivity of Judah and its royal line to Babylon meanwhile.<a name=229:3></a>

		The invasion of the Assyrian into Judea was groundless he dealt treacherously (verse 1), deceived Hezekiah and, after receiving his treasure, broke the covenant and besieged Jerusalem; but the effect of the distress of Israel at the coming of the Assyrian was that Jehovah rose, was exalted, and lifted Himself up (verse 2-10).<a name=229:7></a> One may remark the spirit of intercession in Christ for His people, and how He identifies Himself with them: "Be thou <i>their</i> arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble.<a name=229:8></a>" We see it also very often in the Psalms when He speaks of "mine iniquities" in speaking of those of His people.<a name=229:9></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 16 above all explains why God wished Hezekiah to pass through this trial.<a name=233:9></a> It was needful that flesh should be judged as nought, and that the power which opposes the people of God should be destroyed solely by God's power.<a name=233:10></a> So will it yet be made good spiritually in the Jew, the principle of death for the destruction of the flesh, that the nation, deprived of all confidence in self, may be delivered by the power and grace of God.<a name=233:11></a> Yet was it but a type now: Hezekiah was a saint, but not the Messiah; nor had he learnt the lesson of death and resurrection adequately; but lifted up with pride after his recovery and the destruction of the Assyrian, he displayed the rich stores of his house and dominion to the ambassadors of Merodach-baladan, and hears from the prophet the solemn word of Jehovah that all should be swept away to Babylon, not only all that had been laid up for generations by the royal house, but of his issue to be eunuchs in the palace of the conqueror (chapter 39).<a name=233:12></a> The historical portion is of the utmost weight for the elucidation of this prophecy, which it divides into two very distinct sections, both of which it illustrates, the earlier being external, as the latter is more internal and consequently viewing Israel not merely as a people among hostile nations, but as witnesses to Jehovah as the one true God and awaiting the Messiah, the elect Servant, which they were not, while they failed in both respects, but finally, when bowing to the Messiah in detestation of their idolatry, they become and are owned as His servants when His glory appears, and all ends in the blessing of the faithful and the judgment of the rebellious.<a name=233:13></a> Christ will defend Israel by His power when the Assyrian shall come into their land: "This man shall be the peace," Micah 5.<a name=233:14></a> "And they shall abide; for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.<a name=233:15></a>" Till then it is vain to expect it.<a name=233:16></a>

		In this chapter Jehovah intervenes and announces that He is come to comfort His people.<a name=237:3></a> Verse 2 is the expression of His heart which will have it that Jerusalem has received double for all her sins at His hand.<a name=237:4></a> Verse 3 opens the preparatory warning, but it is of Jehovah's manifestation.<a name=237:5></a> "Every valley shah be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain: and the glory of Jehovah shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together: for the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken it," verse 4, 5.<a name=237:6></a> The Eternal presents Himself to His people and the remnant is manifested by this means.<a name=237:7></a> "The voice said, Cry.<a name=237:8></a> And he said, What shall I cry?<a name=237:9></a> All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field: the grass withereth, the flower fadeth: because the Spirit of Jehovah bloweth upon it: surely the people is grass.<a name=237:10></a> The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever," verse 6-8.<a name=237:11></a> The answer is a sentence on all Israel.<a name=237:12></a> The passage is cited by the apostle of the circumcision to prove that all is rejected save the remnant.<a name=237:13></a> It is also a sentence pronounced on all that which is "flesh.<a name=237:14></a>" For all flesh is grass.<a name=237:15></a> The power of the Spirit discovers to our souls that in the flesh no good dwells, it will not submit to God's law, nor does it love Jesus, nor is it led by the Holy Spirit.<a name=237:16></a> And man who is not of Christ is "flesh.<a name=237:17></a>"

		Chapter 11 of Zechariah has generally been thought one of considerable difficulty; but there are some points in our Lord's character, and the unfolding of the purposes of God in His actual ministry, which I think make comparatively easy what seems most difficult, and may, perhaps, lead the way to what is yet unexplained.<a name=245:1></a> The strong expression of our Lord's mind in Spirit -- the full representation of the moral force in the sight of God of what took place upon His presence on earth -- the breaking up of all God's purposes in their present ministration -- the immense importance which we find consequently to be attached to what in the eye of reason might seem small circumstances, because the principles of God's moral government are involved in them, and all brought out into relief in the person of the Lord Jesus; all contribute to attach the deepest interest to this morally comprehensive chapter, as God's version of all that then passed.<a name=245:2></a> The glory of the house of Israel is laid low -- its external strength and glory.<a name=245:3></a> The glory of the shepherds is spoiled -- its rulers and guides.<a name=245:4></a> The pride of the river of Israel is spoiled -- the national fulness and power.<a name=245:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This is the general statement.<a name=245:6></a> The command follows, "Feed the flock of the slaughter.<a name=245:7></a>" Their possessors (though I have doubted it), I apprehend, must be the Gentiles; their own people, those that sell them to the Gentiles; Herod for example, and the preceding chief priests and princes, or any such characters; some one who owned Jehovah, but sold His people.<a name=245:8></a> The Lord does not think it necessary to say who they are, as He owns them not at all; they are possessed by those who slay them, and sold by persons more or less owning the Lord openly, but loving covetousness, anything but the Lord's care as to their present estate.<a name=245:9></a> This flock of the slaughter -- their own shepherds (who they are there can be no doubt), their own leaders and rulers pity them not.<a name=245:10></a> Verse 4 is the delivery of them, under these circumstances, into the Lord Christ's hands to feed, or take charge of them.<a name=245:11></a> The next verse shews however, that the body of the nation then, who inhabited the land indeed, but were not God's flock (compare 1 Peter 5 and the corresponding charge to Peter in John 21 all of which is properly Jewish), would not be spared.<a name=245:12></a> "I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land -- Israel's land, saith Jehovah; but, to, I will deliver," etc.<a name=245:13></a> When the care was delivered to Him, He would not spare but deliver them to the fruit of their own ways.<a name=245:14></a> Such would be the general state of the inhabitants of the land, and then, "I will feed the flock of the slaughter," the poor, despised people.<a name=245:15></a> "Blessed are the poor, and ye poor," said the Lord,, Himself the feeder of the flock of the slaughter: generally the nation was the flock of the slaughter; but in His hand a distinction was made, between those who were identified with the slayers, and the real flock of the slaughter, even the poor whom He saved.<a name=245:16></a> in judgment He had given up the inhabitants of the land, every man to his neighbour; He would not be a judge and a divider over them; and Herod and Caesar alike preyed upon the land, and they all preyed upon each other -- now especially Caesar their king, "we have no king but Caesar.<a name=245:17></a>" But He took His two staves, of which words we shall see the force presently, and He fed them as a good Shepherd, even them, the poor of the flock: as for their shepherds they were cut off; between them and the good Shepherd there was nothing in common.<a name=245:18></a> His soul loathed them, and their soul abhorred Him.<a name=245:19></a> He had taken however two staves, one, Beauty; and the other, Bands and fed the flock.<a name=245:20></a>

		Then, viewed as in connection with their shepherds, as a nation which must abhor Him, He would not feed the flock: as such, they were delivered up to the fruit of their own will and depravity as it came upon them.<a name=246:1></a> And He took His staff, Beauty, and cut it asunder, that He might break the covenant He had made with all the people, that is, all the <i>peoples</i> (the Ammim).<a name=246:2></a> Now this was formally done at the destruction of Jerusalem, and in fact at the rejection or death of our Lord, when He refused the nation, or when the nation refused Him; in principle, when they rejected His word and works.<a name=246:3></a> To Him was the gathering of the peoples (Ammim) to be.<a name=246:4></a> All nations were to be gathered to the throne of the Lord, to Jerusalem; this was the great, wide, circling covenant, that was made by Christ, made with Christ.<a name=246:5></a> This gathering of the peoples to Jerusalem, clothing herself with them all, was the great gathering foretold; it was to be to Jerusalem, but it was of the peoples; but when Jerusalem rejected Him, to whom was it to be?<a name=246:6></a> So upon the rejection of Him, He broke the covenant made with the peoples, and the destruction and rejection of Jerusalem made the poor of the flock that waited upon Him know that it was the word of the Lord: they knew in faith upon His rejection.<a name=246:7></a> It was then manifested in result, for His rejection had proved the rejection of all their hopes, and they lost the gathering of the nations.<a name=246:8></a> The whole plan was not abandoned but frustrated, that is, in present ministration (in the wisdom of God's counsels), in the rejection of the Lord, who had shewn and warned of all this, and Jesus was the Lord.<a name=246:9></a>

		Nothing I think, can be more simple, if the gathering of the nations (Ammim) promised to Shiloh be seen, and that to Jerusalem, nor than the necessary results as testified by Him on His rejection, proving as to them who might be perplexed upon His rejection by the shepherds, who He was -- that very Word of the Lord, and Himself the truth of all He said.<a name=247:1></a> His word in Zechariah was proved true, it was Himself in all that chapter.<a name=247:2></a> But there was another point incident to the acknowledgment of the Lord.<a name=247:3></a> Being thus refused, He says, "Well, what do you think me worth?<a name=247:4></a>" This would have been most strange, even after His rejection.<a name=247:5></a> "You have rejected me, I came for no other purpose, what do you think me worth?<a name=247:6></a> what is your judgment of the Lord?<a name=247:7></a>" Oh!<a name=247:8></a> what condemnation, while they thought they condemned Him.<a name=247:9></a> "If you think good, give me my price; if not, forbear.<a name=247:10></a>" "I count myself nothing worth, I put no price upon myself, you can do what you please.<a name=247:11></a>" The fulfilment of this -- our Lord indeed became as a servant -- is too well, too little, known in its verity, to need or to be met by verbal explanation.<a name=247:12></a> The transition from all the expectations or titles of Shiloh in meek submission, when He would not have Israel, and He the Lord, is marvellous.<a name=247:13></a> It is here we learn what we can learn nowhere else -- the strange meaning of that word, obedience -- the marvellous mystery of the submission of the Lord.<a name=247:14></a> It is here, in the contrast from Shiloh to a rejected slave not opening his mouth even for the price (may we have grace to own Him in humiliation) discerned of us.<a name=247:15></a> But He was really the Lord in all this, which is the very revelation of this chapter, and it was the judicial process (yet saving to the remnant) of presenting the Lord to them.<a name=247:16></a>

		There was another consequence connected with the acknowledgment of Shiloh, they were to be made one stick; the union of Israel and Judah was to be in His hand; the accompaniment of the same headship which involved the gathering of the Ammi, "then shall the children of Israel and the children of Judah be gathered together, and appoint unto themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the land; for great shall be the day of Jezreel.<a name=248:1></a>" And though Jerusalem was to be the head -- the Jehovah Shammai<a href="#248:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>; yet they were to be no more two, but one in the land; and so the Lord always owned them.<a name=248:2></a> Zebulun and Naphtali saw a great light, and the poor of the flock, "the lost sheep of the house of Israel," indiscriminately met His care, scattered though they might be, but that unity depended upon David their king, their one head.<a name=248:3></a> His rejection broke all this; He cut asunder His other staff "Bands," to break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel; and this surely shall not be united again, till the King be owned again, and then indeed shall these things be according to the sure mercies of David; till then, even if in their land, they shall be a divided and a weakened people; and as I a believe, "Ephraim against Manasseh, and they together against Judah: for all which, his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.<a name=248:4></a>" Verse 15, and possibly also verse 17, but surely verses 15, 16, I believe to belong to the presumptuous shepherd, the fool that says in his heart, "there is no God"; one who shall come in his own name, whom they will receive.<a name=248:5></a> Lord, forgive them yet and deliver!<a name=248:6></a> The word is not merely "foolish," though I have alluded to that, but the word <i>(eveele)</i> which includes in connection with the Lord, impiety, folly against God, in a word -- Antichrist.<a name=248:7></a> They are given up after Christ is rejected, the Gentile history coming in meanwhile.<a name=248:8></a> The idol shepherd does not seem to me to go quite so far, perhaps it applies to the Jews in that day, who desert the flock when evil comes.<a name=248:9></a><a href="#248:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a> The shepherd who is nothing -- emptiness.<a name=248:10></a> Yet Jerusalem shall be made a cup of trembling in that day to the nations round about her, but this is the Lord's mercy.<a name=248:11></a> Having then given what the leading principles of the chapter appear to me to be, I will not pursue that which follows, though affording the leading principle of the whole of this prophecy would be of the deepest interest, and, I believe, afford much instruction in the testimony of God.<a name=248:12></a>

		We arrive at that part of the Gospel where other ways of God, other manifestations of His character and of His glory, are substituted for Judaism.<a name=251:1></a> The kingdom and the form that it would take have been already revealed to us in chapter 13.<a name=251:2></a> However, though the form announced in the parables was to be new, the kingdom itself was in view since the time of John the Baptist, though it could not be established then, Jesus being rejected.<a name=251:3></a> Purposes of God, important in very different respects, were to be accomplished through the death of the Lord.<a name=251:4></a> And although the judgment of Israel had been plainly declared, and the new condition of the kingdom depicted in the parables of chapter 13, the power and the patient grace of the Lord were manifested in the midst of the people, up to the close of chapter 15.<a name=251:5></a> But now all is terminated: the church and the kingdom of glory take the place of an Emmanuel Messiah in the midst of the people.<a name=251:6></a> The unbelief of the heads of the nation is manifested in their request for a sign from heaven; signs enough had been given.<a name=251:7></a> It was not genuine faith, and the Lord reproves them and goes away.<a name=251:8></a> They knew well enough how to observe the signs of the weather that was coming; how was it then that they did not see the far clearer signs of Israel's condition -- signs which were precursors of the judgment of God?<a name=251:9></a> It was nothing but hypocrisy: they should only have the sign of Jonas; the death and the resurrection of Jesus bringing the judgment, the terrible punishment of the nation, as a natural and necessary consequence of the scornful rejection of their Messiah come in grace.<a name=251:10></a>

		We know what was the burning ardour of this man, an ardour which placed him in difficulties from which his moral power could not succeed in extricating him and which even brought him, when God permitted it for his good, to deny his Saviour and his Master.<a name=252:5></a> So far as he was sustained by human strength, this ardour was a continual snare; but under God's hand, when grace took hold of the vessel, he became the instrument of the most blessed activity.<a name=252:6></a> I find this instructive difference: human energy cannot sustain the trials of faith.<a name=252:7></a> It may bring us into circumstances where these trials are found, but the strength of man's will cannot make us triumph.<a name=252:8></a> If the power of God is there, we triumph over temptation; the flesh which has brought us into it cannot do so.<a name=252:9></a> Nevertheless God can make use of the vessel which He has formed; then the power of God is there to hold us up, sheltered from evil by His arms.<a name=252:10></a> Now what I desire to remark here is that God makes use of the vessel for His glory; whilst, when the vessel alone and the energy which is in it are at work, it fails in time of trial, and the energy, which God makes use of as an instrument, brings us, when it acts alone, into temptation, in which it cannot cause us to triumph.<a name=252:11></a> Sincerity and zeal in that case only cause us to fall because there is too much confidence in ourselves.<a name=252:12></a> Here it is the ardent confession of what the Father Himself had revealed to Peter.<a name=252:13></a> There are two parts in this confession -- Jesus is the Christ, that is what the Jews denied.<a name=252:14></a> This was the first thing to be acknowledged in Jesus.<a name=252:15></a> He was the One who had been promised to the fathers and to Israel; but further, He was of the fulness of that eternal Godhead, in which was the power of life; "the Son of the living God.<a name=252:16></a>" Resurrection was the proof of it in the very place where death had entered.<a name=252:17></a> Thus, at the commencement of the Epistle to the Romans, He is of the seed of David according to the flesh, and marked out Son of God in power by resurrection of the dead.<a name=252:18></a> The promises of God were thus not only accomplished in His person, but the person in whom they were accomplished was Son of God in a power of life which is in God only; not only Son of God born into this world according to Psalm 2 -- Nathaniel had acknowledged that -- but Son of the living God as to His person.<a name=252:19></a> Up to that time this had not been acknowledged; the Father had revealed it to Peter, the Father in heaven had made known to him His Son upon earth.<a name=252:20></a>

		At the same time the Lord also shews His authority by giving to Peter a name in accordance with the confession that he had just made, with the truth which (while establishing His divine person, His relationship with the Father, and that as a man) laid the firm foundation of what was above all promises, of what had never been promised of the new thing, the church of the living God.<a name=253:1></a> Against this power of life in the person of the Son, the might of Satan, who had the empire of death, could not prevail.<a name=253:2></a> It is not here the death and the resurrection of Jesus, or His work, and the proof by this power of life that He was the Son of God in power; it is the essential character of His person revealed by the Father to Simon Bar-jona.<a name=253:3></a> Christ also says something to Him.<a name=253:4></a> As the Father had revealed the true character of Jesus to Simon, Jesus also (it is thus that we must take the sentence) gave him a name and a position.<a name=253:5></a> His person as Son of the living God was the foundation of the church called to have its true place in heaven, for it is in this character that it is presented to us here.<a name=253:6></a> It is Christ who builds, and up to this day the building is not yet completed.<a name=253:7></a> What we have here is not what Paul speaks of in 1 Corinthians 3.<a name=253:8></a> He, Paul, had laid the foundation of that house: others brought materials, each one on his own responsibility, so that wood, stubble, hay, were to be found in the building.<a name=253:9></a> That was what has been built under human responsibility upon the earth.<a name=253:10></a> What we have here is found again in 1 Peter 2: 4, 5, where there is no human architect, but where living stones come and are builded together into a spiritual building.<a name=253:11></a> The same thing is found again in Ephesians 2: 20, 21.<a name=253:12></a> It is Christ who builds a spiritual house, and the power of Satan could not touch it.<a name=253:13></a> It is the assembly which Christ builds for heaven and for eternity.<a name=253:14></a>

		But there was yet another thing.<a name=254:1></a> The Lord, Master of all, gives the keys of the kingdom of heaven to Peter.<a name=254:2></a> He receives from Christ authority to administer the kingdom upon earth, and whatever he might decree here below would be sanctioned.<a name=254:3></a> It is no question, remark well, of keys of the church; one does not build with keys.<a name=254:4></a> Further, although Simon may receive the name of Peter, a testimony to his personal faith, which linked him with the Rock, and an acknowledgment of the fact that like a stone in its nature he belonged to the Rock; nevertheless here he does nothing at all, nor has he any authority, in the church.<a name=254:5></a> Christ Himself builds, "I will build my church.<a name=254:6></a>" No one else has any part in this.<a name=254:7></a> Peter himself acknowledges it in his epistle (1 Peter 2: 4, 5), by an evident allusion to this passage; the living stones come to the "living Stone.<a name=254:8></a>" The administration of the kingdom of heaven is confided to him.<a name=254:9></a> The keys of that kingdom are confided to him.<a name=254:10></a> For, I repeat, no such thing exists as keys of the church.<a name=254:11></a> Christ builds it, that is all.<a name=254:12></a> Now one can see well in the Acts that Simon Peter was the chief instrument of God in the work; and no true Christian doubts that what he established by his apostolic authority, with the sanction of the Lord, is from heaven.<a name=254:13></a> We must further remark that the only succession in that authority is found in two or three gathered in the name of the Lord (Mart.<a name=254:14></a> 18: 17-20).<a name=254:15></a> Christendom has accepted with strange facility the idea that there are keys for the church, an idea which is nowhere found in the word.<a name=254:16></a> Then, this error being once admitted, another was accepted, namely, that the church and the kingdom of heaven are the same thing, an idea also which has no foundation in the word.<a name=254:17></a> The passage that we are considering clearly shews that they are two distinct things.<a name=254:18></a> Christ does not build a kingdom, He is the King of it; whether as such He be either hidden or manifested.<a name=254:19></a> Further, a kingdom is neither a bride nor a body, as the church is, and the reader must remark, that since it is here Christ who builds, He certainly places none but true living stones in the house.<a name=254:20></a> At most there is a certain analogy in regard to historical limits and circumstances, with the house of which Paul speaks in 1 Corinthians 3 in which were found hay and stubble, the building in that case being left to the responsibility of man.<a name=254:21></a> What is positive is that in no case are the church and the kingdom the same thing.<a name=254:22></a> Further, to have confounded the church, which Christ alone builds, and which is not yet completed, with the house which Paul founded upon earth, is one of the origins of the Romish system, and of the high church, wherever it may be.<a name=254:23></a>

		The difficulty, suggested by the opinion drawn from Malachi by the scribes, the last testimony given (namely, that Elias was to come before the glorious day of the Lord), presents itself to the disciples.<a name=258:1></a> The Lord confirms this testimony and speaks of it as a thing which was to come to pass.<a name=258:2></a> Elias is to come first -- the idea is true -- and he will restore all things.<a name=258:3></a> The prophecy of Malachi shall be accomplished, but as Jesus came to suffer before His glory, so too there had come one to go before His face, and he must needs be rejected like Him whom he announced.<a name=258:4></a> Then the disciples understood that He spoke of John the Baptist, come before the Lord, in the spirit and power of Elias.<a name=258:5></a> For what concerned the kingdom, all in fact, was only provisional.<a name=258:6></a> The king was there indeed, the Son of God Himself, but for a greater work even than establishing the kingdom: to save sinners and glorify God Himself by His death.<a name=258:7></a> To establish the kingdom He will return; but then all was prepared for faith to have its foundation, and for man to be without excuse.<a name=258:8></a> It was for that reason that the Lord could say, "Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel till the Son of man be come" (chapter 10: 23), although He was there.<a name=258:9></a> However, His establishment as king has been deferred, the last half-week of Daniel still remains unaccomplished, and even the whole week for unbelief.<a name=258:10></a> Christ is seated at the right hand of God till His enemies be set as the footstool of His feet, having by Himself purified our sins, gathering, as we know, His co-heirs according to the counsels of God, co-heirs given to Him before the foundation of the world.<a name=258:11></a>

		Two great principles are laid down by the Lord in reply to the question of His disciples.<a name=259:1></a> First, faith can do everything, according to the willed action of God at the moment of its exercise: but to overcome the enemy, where he shews his strength specially, a life of retirement is needed, which, in the consciousness of the strife in which we are engaged, refers to the presence of God, and places itself before Him in abasement of the flesh, and in entire confidence.<a name=259:2></a> This confidence displays itself in dependence on Him, owned in order to seek divine action.<a name=259:3></a> The Lord (verse 22) returns to His instructions with regard to His rejection and His crucifixion.<a name=259:4></a> Delivered up to men, He must be put to death and He must rise again.<a name=259:5></a> The disciples entirely ignorant of salvation are deeply pained by it', but at the end of the chapter the Lord places His disciples, at least Peter, and according to His grace all of us, in the same relation with His Father as that in which He was Himself, whilst at the same time manifesting the divinity of His person.<a name=259:6></a> It is one of the most touching expositions of what was about to happen through the change that His work would produce -- the revelation of a position always true as to His person, true as to His relationships, having become man before God, but which was about to be demonstrated in a glorious manner by His resurrection.<a name=259:7></a> At the same time He introduces His own beforehand into His own position, now that He was about to give up the kingdom in Israel as far as it belonged to Him there; now that He had just announced to His disciples His death and resurrection as necessary for introducing them into greater blessings than those which they enjoyed through His presence.<a name=259:8></a>

		Chapter 20: 1-16 shews, to explain it, that, while recompensing each sacrifice faithfully according to His goodness, God is sovereign in what He gives; and that if He judges good, He can find the occasion of giving to those who, in man's estimate, might not have laboured so much, the same reward as to those who wished to gain according to their labour.<a name=268:5></a> The first workman has for principle so much labour for so much pay; the others betake themselves to the good will of the Lord of the vineyard.<a name=268:6></a> You shall receive what is just; and grace recompenses beyond all desert of labour.<a name=268:7></a> Such is the great principle of all true service rendered to the Lord.<a name=268:8></a> There is the principle in question, and the final phrase (verse 16) refers to what was said at the beginning: "So the last shall be first, and the first last.<a name=268:9></a>" It is the inverse, however, of what is said (chapter 19: 30) at the beginning of the parable, where this sentence refers to the thought of man, "What shall we have therefore?<a name=268:10></a>" whilst the final phrase refers to the thought of God who takes pleasure in blessing, according to the riches of His grace and power, according to His goodness.<a name=268:11></a> It is always thus in every case.<a name=268:12></a> The workman shall receive according to his labour, as that happened to the first that was called.<a name=268:13></a> God gives according to His goodness and His grace.<a name=268:14></a> There had not been a refusal to the invitations among the last (verse 6, 7): God called them when the moment that pleased Him arrived.<a name=268:15></a>

		Thus the Son of man (a far wider title than that of Messiah, since it embraces all the rights of Christ in the counsels of God) was to suffer, to be rejected and put to death, then to arise from among the dead in order to lay the foundation of the eternal blessing of man and even the temporal blessing of Israel, on the assured basis of the atoning work which Christ was about to accomplish.<a name=270:4></a> These things could only be accomplished according to the power of an altogether new position -- beyond death, the power of the enemy, and the wrath of God, according to the position of man risen, fruit of a work accomplished and approved by God, and a proof of divine power; a position consequently unchangeable, and not a blessing dependent on the responsibility of man, under which all was called in question, as in the case of Adam, who, in fact, failed in it.<a name=270:5></a> Here the blessing was to rest on a work in which God was about to be perfectly glorified.<a name=270:6></a> He has been, in fact, put to the proof -- this gracious Saviour, but only to manifest His perfect faithfulness and obedience.<a name=270:7></a>, whatever besides may have been the depth of His sufferings.<a name=270:8></a> But then He must drink the cup; the cross was His lot.<a name=270:9></a> Not only so, but His disciples must follow Him in that path.<a name=270:10></a> A victorious Messiah would place His own on thrones of judgment, but with a Saviour dying on the cross, all that must, for the moment, be laid aside.<a name=270:11></a> He must first accomplish a work of far different character of glory, and open to His disciples (with regard to what would result from it here below) a pathway like His own.<a name=270:12></a> They must follow it; there was the path which He Himself trod, and which He was tracing for them to follow Him.<a name=270:13></a> The two disciples (their hearts filled with carnal desire of greatness, their spiritual sight wholly obscured by the thought of Messiah's earthly reign, and only looking at human glory) ask of Jesus the favour of sitting on His right and on His left in the kingdom of their desires.<a name=270:14></a> But, as in many other circumstances, the folly of the flesh is only an occasion for the Saviour to bring to light the thought of the Spirit.<a name=270:15></a>

		CHAPTER 22
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The parable of the husbandman refers to the responsibility of man, even when it treated of Christ's coming.<a name=277:4></a> Now the Lord proceeds to speak of the ways of God in grace toward Israel and also toward the Gentiles.<a name=277:5></a> In the preceding parable it was a question of seeking fruit as God was doing in Israel.<a name=277:6></a> Here a king makes a marriage -- feast for his son, and invites the guests to the feast.<a name=277:7></a> Remark also that it is a likeness of the kingdom of the heavens (verse 2), whilst in the preceding parable they were seeking the fruits according to a fixed measure of obligation, that is, the law, though this were by the ministry of the prophets and the Son, without the kingdom being in question.<a name=277:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Those first invited were the Jews, and of course also during the lifetime of Christ (verse 3).<a name=277:9></a> Afterwards, when all things were ready He sent once more His servants -- the apostles after His death -- to invite them to the wedding-feast (verse 4); but they made light of it.<a name=277:10></a> We find here the two characters of men: the pre-occupied whose interest is in the world, and who do not trouble themselves about the Lord; and the violent who persecute His messengers (verse 5, 6).<a name=277:11></a> Luke, as is so often the case when moral things are treated of, enters more into detail, whilst for the other part he recounts in few words a crowd of incidents which do not make a moral picture.<a name=277:12></a> Luke, I say, enters more into details for the purpose of shewing what excuses men present for neglecting Christ; then he gives us to see the Lord seeking in grace the poor despised ones of Israel when the chiefs would not have the Messiah.<a name=277:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here we have the great historical fact that Jerusalem and the Jews as such would not have anything to do with Him and would persecute those that are His, bringing on themselves as they have done the judgment of God and ruin.<a name=277:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=278>[Page 278]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Afterwards He causes them to seek out the Gentiles, sinners where they are, and the guest-chamber of the wedding-feast is filled with people.<a name=278:1></a> But then comes a judgment which is exercised with regard to all these guests.<a name=278:2></a> We have only one example here, but this to lay down the principle.<a name=278:3></a> Christendom gathered by the message of the gospel is the object of God's judgment according to the nature of the invitation which has been made.<a name=278:4></a> For a wedding-feast there must be a wedding-garment.<a name=278:5></a> One must have put on Christ to have part in His joy.<a name=278:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We find here too another principle important and worthy of remark, a principle which flows from the form of the parable: the judgment is an individual judgment.<a name=278:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here is that which I would say.<a name=278:8></a> The first part of this parable, of which the subject is grace, brings judgment on the Jews, who had despised the invitation of the King acting in grace and summoning them to the feast, who had evil -- entreated the messengers, and who, following up their refusal to render Him the fruits of the vineyard, had outraged His servants the prophets, and finally laid their hands on His only Son and put to death His beloved.<a name=278:9></a> But at the end of the parable, when, the invitation having been sent on all sides, the house was filled with guests, though Christendom be cut off like Judaism, another sort of judgment is revealed to us, an individual judgment, in which it is a question of knowing if the individual is in a state which suits the privileges he enjoys.<a name=278:10></a> It is not a question of the destruction of a city and of the nationality of God's earthly people, of an exterior judgment which closes the economy, the existence of the nation under the old covenant, all the Jewish system.<a name=278:11></a> It is a question of knowing whether the state of him who is present at the feast suits the marriage-supper of the Son, of the great King: if not, whilst the feast continues, the individual unfit for the marriage-supper is cast into outer darkness where is weeping and gnashing of teeth.<a name=278:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The principle established, one sees that it applies alas!<a name=278:13></a> to many: many are called, but few chosen.<a name=278:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The parable of the husbandmen is the history of Judaism up to the rejection and the crucifixion of Christ; that of the marriage-feast is the history of the reception of the gospel, first by the Jews, then by the Gentiles, with that which results from the exterior participation in that grace, and the sorting which takes place in the very bosom of those privileges.<a name=278:15></a>

		In resuming the order of the thoughts from chapter 20: 29 we have seen thus far: the presentation of Jesus as Son of David at Jerusalem; the state of the Jews laid down as to the fact in the parable of the two sons; their judgment as a nation in the parable of the vineyard, a judgment which besides had been already described in the fig-tree become dried up.<a name=279:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here it is useful to draw attention to the difference between these two cases.<a name=279:2></a> In the two it is Israel without fruit, judged and set aside; but in the case of the fig-tree it is Israel in fact, such as the Saviour found them: plenty of leaves, a fair appearance, but no fruit answering to what the Saviour was seeking, to what His heart wanted; also the judgment has another and more profound character.<a name=279:3></a> The tree was bad; human nature under the culture of God Himself was worth nothing.<a name=279:4></a> On His entrance into this world there was on the Saviour's path but one people which had enjoyed this culture; it was Israel -- man having all the advantages which man could have as placed on his responsibility here below.<a name=279:5></a> Now man according to the flesh is condemned; never will he bear fruit: it is all over with him.<a name=279:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The parable of the husbandmen attaches itself rather to the nation, as sphere of the ways of God, an economy on the earth; not human nature under the law, but the chiefs of the nation to whom the vineyard of God had been confided.<a name=279:7></a> God had had long patience; He was seeking fruits which were due to Him; and His messengers, His servants, had been dishonoured, ill-treated, and even killed.<a name=279:8></a> There was one thing more that God could do, and He did it; He sent His Son.<a name=279:9></a> The husbandmen cast Him out of the vineyard and killed Him; they must undergo the judgment they had deserved.<a name=279:10></a> It is not the incurable evil, the flesh which cannot please God, which perishes before His eyes; it is an exterior and terrible judgment falling on the nation which, notwithstanding all the patience of God displayed toward it in its long career, has crowned its iniquity by rejecting and crucifying His Son.<a name=279:11></a> This people suffers the public judgment of God; it is a body ruined, broken in consequence of its sin; it will be ground to powder (save the small remnant God has reserved for Himself) when in the last days it will be found an adversary and apostate.<a name=279:12></a>

		After this parable we have the kingdom of the heavens, the grace which Israel equally rejects, but which, being spread far and wide, fills the house with guests, Gentiles as well as Jews.<a name=280:1></a> Here we find also judgment, but bearing on the question whether the individual is suitable for the position in which he is found.<a name=280:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now after these great principles, after these features which give us the situation, all classes of the Jews, each in its turn come to be judged, just when they thought they were to cast divine wisdom into perplexity by questions it could not answer; for they believed themselves wise and thought they had to do with a poor unlettered Galilean.<a name=280:3></a> How blind this world, and religious men; and how wicked the heart of man!<a name=280:4></a> The Lord is in their midst in grace, and these men, the one as much as the other, would shew that He is in the wrong!<a name=280:5></a>

		First (verse 15), the Pharisees gather together and take counsel together, seeking to entangle Him in His words.<a name=280:6></a> They hold strongly themselves to the Jewish self-government, as being the people of Jehovah who were not to be subject to the Gentiles.<a name=280:7></a> The Herodians, on the contrary, attached themselves to Herod's dynasty, representing the imperial power of Rome which had placed him there as a subordinate king.<a name=280:8></a> They thought that, if Jesus acknowledged the Roman authority, He would lose in the eyes of the people His character of Messiah who was to deliver them from that yoke; if He rejected that authority, they might denounce Him to the civil power.<a name=280:9></a> It was of small moment to them that they should be inconsistent, if they could only get rid of God and His truth.<a name=280:10></a> The bitterest foes become friends to rid themselves of Christ.<a name=280:11></a> As Herod and Pilate, Pharisees and Herodians, Pharisees and Sadducees, all the world agree for that.<a name=280:12></a> The Pharisees and the Herodians came then together to question Him, and ask, while flattering Him for His integrity, if, yes or no, one ought to pay tribute to Caesar.<a name=280:13></a> The Lord, perceiving clearly their hypocrisy, points it out to them; then He asks them to shew Him the current money with which they paid the tribute in the country.<a name=280:14></a> Whose image and superscription did this piece bear?<a name=280:15></a> They say to Him, Caesar's.<a name=280:16></a> Render then, said He, to Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and to God the things which are God's.<a name=280:17></a> God had subjected the Jews for their sins to the Gentiles; they should own His hand and submit to this yoke, until God according to His promise should free them from it.<a name=280:18></a> Meanwhile they should render to God the things which are God's.<a name=280:19></a> They were doing neither the one nor the other.<a name=280:20></a> Rebels against God in all their ways, they were constantly rising against the Romans.<a name=280:21></a> Astonished at the Lord's answer, they leave Him to go their way.<a name=280:22></a>

		The same day the Sadducees, who deny the resurrection, came to submit to Him the case of a woman who, according to the law of Moses, had had seven husbands.<a name=281:1></a> Whose wife of the seven, demand they, should she be at the time of the resurrection?<a name=281:2></a> Here a fundamental truth was in question: also the Lord's answer is formal and precise.<a name=281:3></a> To put the resurrection in question was to be ignorant of the scriptures and of the power of God.<a name=281:4></a> Death did not terminate the existence of man.<a name=281:5></a> If God was the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, He was not the God of those who did not exist.<a name=281:6></a> All live for Him, if they are dead for men; and, though life and incorruption are only brought to light by the gospel, the Old Testament sufficed to shew that God had been, and was, and would be, the God of the faithful, in order that they should be with Him, not only as souls but as men, soul and body, even as He had made them; only risen, a thing necessary after death.<a name=281:7></a> When God said, I am the God of Abraham, Abraham was a man living for Him and was to be raised.<a name=281:8></a> But the Lord treats also the positive side of the question.<a name=281:9></a> In the resurrection all is changed it is no question either of marrying or of giving in marriage one is as the angels of God in heaven.<a name=281:10></a> It is not the question here of the position one may be found in, but of the character in which one subsists.<a name=281:11></a> The resurrection is a foundation of the gospel.<a name=281:12></a> Our faith is vain if Christ is not risen: a thing evidently true, for if man rises not, Christ Himself is not risen.<a name=281:13></a> He is then dead also without remedy or answer; He is vanquished, not victor.<a name=281:14></a> The Sadducees are put to silence, and the two great sects of the Jews have nothing more to say.<a name=281:15></a>

		But the Lord having done what the Pharisees, adversaries of the Sadducees, could not do, the curiosity of the Pharisees is excited, and they were gathered together (verse 34) One among them questions the Lord; but his demand 'has for result that Jesus lays the true foundation of the law and the prophets, and then establishes clearly the situation of things, the question of the moment, as God regarded it.<a name=281:16></a> Which, asks the lawyer, is the great commandment in the law?<a name=281:17></a> A question much debated among the Jews, for whom each commandment had a special value, the observance of each of them gaining, as in an examination, so many good marks from God.<a name=281:18></a> The Lord seizes the occasion, offered in the ways of God, to establish the fundamental principles of the divine law.<a name=281:19></a> To love God with all the heart, such is the first commandment.<a name=281:20></a> The second is like it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.<a name=281:21></a> All in man hung on these two things.<a name=281:22></a> It is the summary of what man ought to be, the root and the measure of human righteousness.<a name=281:23></a> It is not in any way a revelation of divine love; it is not at all a question of grace, nor of an open way for the sinner to come to God; but it is the perfect rule of what a man should be, a divine compendium of the substance of the law, the law on which the prophets insisted in seeking to recall the people to its observance.<a name=281:24></a>

		We find here, first the position of the disciples in the midst of the Jews, as long as God would endure these last, and that which, in this respect, suited the servants of Jesus; then the iniquity and the hypocrisy of the scribes and the Pharisees; lastly the love and sovereign grace of Jesus, grace which overflows and displays what He is, even when He is announcing judgment.<a name=283:1></a> Hence a this part of the Gospel is bound up with the ways of God in relation with His earthly people, as the then moment when all that was passing is bound up with the last days.<a name=283:2></a> All connects itself with the Jews of that time and with the relation of the disciples with this people, and thence passes to the last times, leaving the church aside, save that the mention of the last times introduces necessarily the responsibility of those who replace the Jews as servants of the Lord during His absence, and finally the judgment of the Gentiles.<a name=283:3></a>

		The disciples are left by the Lord in the relation with the Jewish chiefs in which they were then found and up to the judicial rejection of the people at the time of the destruction of Jerusalem.<a name=283:4></a> The Saviour places them in the same category as the multitude.<a name=283:5></a> All were subjected to the authority of the scribes and the Pharisees.<a name=283:6></a> These were seated in Moses' seat; and one ought to hear them as to injunctions which they drew from the law given by his means.<a name=283:7></a> Nevertheless one must carefully guard against following their walk: they were hypocrites who spoke and did not act.<a name=283:8></a> They made the law very strict for others and very light for themselves; they loved to appear before men with the forms of piety to acquire a religious reputation; they sought the first places in the synagogues, salutations in the public places, and to be called Rabbi, making themselves esteemed in the eyes of the world by religion.<a name=283:9></a>

		The spirit of the disciples was to be the opposite of all that.<a name=283:10></a> They were not to be called Rabbi, for Christ alone was their Master, and they were brethren; they were not any more to call others by the name of father, for one only was their Father He who is in the heavens; finally they were not to be called teachers, for Christ alone was He who taught them.<a name=283:11></a> He who would be great in their midst was to be their servant, for whoever exalted himself on earth would be abased, and he who abased himself would be exalted.<a name=283:12></a> This is just what Christ has done, whilst man, having wished to exalt himself and be as God, has been abased and will be yet more in facing the judgment of God.<a name=283:13></a> (Compare Philippians 2.<a name=283:14></a>)

		One is asked sometimes how it has happened that those so excellent men of past times had no knowledge of this truth -- were not animated by this hope.<a name=294:1></a> The answer is easy: the wise virgins slept like the foolish.<a name=294:2></a> Waiting for the Saviour was lost in the church.<a name=294:3></a> And, mark it well, it is the cry, Behold the Bridegroom!<a name=294:4></a> which awakens from their sleep slumbering Christians.<a name=294:5></a> One must not fall under illusions the proper state of Christians depends on this expectation "Ye yourselves" it is said, "like unto men that wait for their lord.<a name=294:6></a>" Without doubt the new nature that the Christian receives produces essentially the same fruits, whatever be the circumstances in which it is found; but also the character is formed by the object that governs the heart; and there is nothing which detaches from the world like waiting for the Lord, nothing which searches the heart like this expectation, in order that there be nothing that suits not His presence.<a name=294:7></a> Nothing consequently introduces like it the feelings of Jesus in the judgment that it conveys on good and on evil; nothing like it for cherishing affection for Jesus in the motives which govern our conduct.<a name=294:8></a> Remark also that in reality it is the same waiting for the Saviour, the fact of watching in waiting for Him, which is in question here: not at all the service that we have to accomplish during His absence.<a name=294:9></a> Service and the responsibility that attaches to it are found in the following parable (chapter 25: 14-30).<a name=294:10></a>

		Let us remark in our two parables an important fact which we shall find again elsewhere.<a name=296:6></a> The Lord, in the teachings which relate to His coming, says nothing which can give one occasion to think that it must necessarily be delayed beyond the life of those whom He addresses.<a name=296:7></a> Thus the virgins who slept are the same who awoke; the servants who received the talents are the same as those whose work is taken account of at the end.<a name=296:8></a> We know that many generations have appeared and disappeared since the departure of the Saviour, but He did not wish that they should be expecting beforehand any delay.<a name=296:9></a> In the same way when He wishes to give the history of the church to the close, the Spirit of God takes up seven churches which existed at that moment in order to describe in seven epochs the great features of that history; so that, although we may recognise now these features and these periods, there was nothing when the Apocalypse was written which announced in a formal manner any continuance of the church on earth.<a name=296:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another remark I have to make.<a name=296:11></a> What is said in verse 23 seems to me to state a general principle.<a name=296:12></a> Those who possess Christian privileges without any living enjoyment of them, without truly knowing the Lord Jesus Himself, lose all that they have (this answers to Hebrews 6); whilst those who are faithful to the light they possess acquire more.<a name=296:13></a> This, too, is the explanation given in verse 29.<a name=296:14></a> The judgment upon the wicked servant is executed in verse 30.<a name=296:15></a>

		We have gone through in these three parables the judgment of Christendom, of the church viewed as a divine system established on the earth, but exposed to the consequences of being established on the foundation of human responsibility; then of individuals who profess to be Christians considered with regard to their duty of waiting for the coming of the Lord, and in relation to their service during His absence.<a name=297:1></a> In verse 31 the Lord again takes up the thread of what He had already said with regard to the history of the earth and the things which will happen at His coming.<a name=297:2></a> This verse is linked, as I have said before, with chapter 24: 31, before which all the relationships of the remnant with the unfaithful people and with the Gentiles, first in testimony, then in unparalleled sufferings, had been set out as preceding the personal coming of the Saviour, who will put an end to these sufferings.<a name=297:3></a> Now when the Lord shall appear in these circumstances, it will not be only to shine and then to disappear, as a flash of lightning; He will sit on the throne of His glory.<a name=297:4></a> Then when His warrior judgment, namely what is executed on His adversaries shall be accomplished (see Revelation 19: 11), the Lord seated on His throne will judge the nations of the whole world to whom the gospel of the kingdom shall have been sent.<a name=297:5></a> This mission is found announced in verse 14 of chapter 24, which closes the first part of the prophecy of that chapter.<a name=297:6></a> It is a question there of the gospel that Jesus preached during His lifetime, as well as John the Baptist; it is not the gospel of the death and resurrection of Jesus (that is to say, a work of eternal redemption fully accomplished), but the solemn fact that the kingdom was going to be established; it is the "everlasting gospel.<a name=297:7></a>" The Lord was about to begin to break the serpent's head by the establishment of this kingdom, to take in hand His great power and act as King.<a name=297:8></a> This testimony is to be rendered after the catching up of the church and before the manifestation of the Lord.<a name=297:9></a> The testimony rendered to the Jews is found in Revelation 11; but here we learn that it will be heard also in the entire world before the end comes.<a name=297:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		At the time then when the Lord shall be seated on the throne of His glory, He will begin to pronounce His judgment on the nations and to execute it.<a name=297:11></a> The word mentions two kinds of judgment, the warrior judgment, and that wherein the Judge is in session as supreme and recognised authority.<a name=297:12></a> Thus Revelation 19 is the warrior judgment.<a name=297:13></a> In chapter 20 begins the judicial session which is held when the power of the King has established His throne, and He sits there to judge (Revelation 19: 11; 20: 4).<a name=297:14></a>

		As to the destruction of the beast and his armies, it takes place by the coming of the Lord, who destroys his armies and casts the beast and the false prophet at the same time into hell.<a name=298:1></a> Then He establishes His throne in Jerusalem.<a name=298:2></a> After this Gog comes, thinking to have all his own way; he finds the Lord Himself, and perishes on the mountains of Israel.<a name=298:3></a> Then, the throne being established in peace, the Lord sits there to judge the nations to which previously the gospel of the kingdom had been sent.<a name=298:4></a> The terms of the judgment shew us that it is no question whatever of a general judgment, as people commonly think of it.<a name=298:5></a> They are there judged according to the manner that they treated the messengers of the gospel of the kingdom.<a name=298:6></a> It is of this only that they here give an account to the Judge; it is on this only that He questions them.<a name=298:7></a> Now, as the greatest number of pagans have never heard of such messengers, this judgment cannot be theirs, being wholly inapplicable to them.<a name=298:8></a> Besides at the beginning of the Epistle to the Romans the judgment of the nations is pronounced, their guilt established on entirely different principles, namely, that they gave up the knowledge of God when they possessed it; that they disregarded the testimony of creation, then that of conscience; finally, that they plunged, consequent on this voluntary alienation from God, into idolatry and corruption, who should do worst.<a name=298:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next we find here three classes, the goats, the sheep, and the brethren of the judge; that is to say, those who had not received the messengers, those who had received them, and the messengers themselves.<a name=298:10></a> It is the judgment of the quick, of the nations; a final judgment.<a name=298:11></a> They go thence to Gehenna, to everlasting torment, whilst the righteous possess everlasting life here on earth, but enjoy it with God.<a name=298:12></a> It is the judgment of the valley of Jehoshaphat when Jehovah shall have gathered the nations, and there shall be multitudes in this valley of decision.<a name=298:13></a> The judgment of the quick is a scriptural truth as certainly as the judgment of the dead.<a name=298:14></a> Not only so, but the Jews were much more familiar, and this according to their own scriptures of the Old Testament, with the judgment of the quick than with the judgment of the dead.<a name=298:15></a> Doubtless there were in the Old Testament words which had given the Pharisees to understand the latter, as also the Lord justifies them on this point whilst He condemns the Sadducees.<a name=298:16></a> Yet these were held as good Jews, and the high priest and his family were of this sect.<a name=298:17></a> Nobody put their orthodoxy in question.<a name=298:18></a> They were wrong, we know; but when we see the passage by which the Lord convicts them, we understand how some who had not the Spirit of God might remain in ignorance of the truth in this respect.<a name=298:19></a> If one did not seize the fact that God looks at man as having a body as well as a soul, so that the life beyond death demonstrates also the resurrection, one has still trouble to seize the force of the proof alleged by the Lord.<a name=298:20></a> For him who knows that the Lord is risen and that we are to be conformed to Him, the thing is simple.<a name=298:21></a> Death touches only the body; if one subsists afterwards, it is to be a complete man.<a name=298:22></a> One thing proves the other.<a name=298:23></a> The soul is happy with Christ meanwhile, but the man is not complete.<a name=298:24></a> He lives, the man who died; after death, all live for God, they are only dead for man; this last state of death must cease, but will only cease at the resurrection.<a name=298:25></a> Meanwhile the soul is with the Lord, the witness, since life is not terminated, that death is not to retain him who is subjected to it.<a name=298:26></a>

		Now Christians have trouble in believing a judgment on the earth, though they profess it in the Creed.<a name=299:1></a> But the word of God is clear thereon.<a name=299:2></a> Prophecy speaks of it largely.<a name=299:3></a> There is a judgment of the quick, as there is a judgment of the dead; and this judgment we have here, at least the most formal part, that where the Lord sits on His throne and personally judges the nations.<a name=299:4></a> Elsewhere they are suddenly destroyed by His glorious appearing, being found, either gathered to make war on Him as in Revelation 17: 14, and Revelation 19, or surrounding the camp of the saints and the beloved city (and here they are suddenly destroyed by fire come down from heaven) as in Revelation 20: 7-9.<a name=299:5></a> But here the Lord, seated on His throne, after having already come as lightning on those who were warring against Him, judges as King all the nations of the earth, according to the reception that each shall have given to His brethren the messengers of the kingdom, counting all that was done to them as done to Himself personally.<a name=299:6></a>

		Such is the grand principle of this judgment.<a name=300:1></a> "The sheep disavow all pretension to have had regard to the King personally; but He takes as done to Himself all that they had done to His messengers whom He owned as His brethren.<a name=300:2></a> "The goats," on the contrary, pretend never to have failed toward the great King; but on the same principle the indifference they had shewn toward His messengers counts in the heart of the King for indifference toward Him.<a name=300:3></a> Thus it is just His judgment of the nations, but it is also a great encouragement for His servants whom He will send to the nations; it is also, in principle, an encouragement for all times.<a name=300:4></a> He thinks always of His own as if they were Himself.<a name=300:5></a> "Why," says He to Saul, "persecutest thou Me?<a name=300:6></a>" This goes farther, it is true; for those that Saul persecuted were members of His body whilst He was in heaven; the others were His brethren on the earth.<a name=300:7></a> I speak of this as testimony to the great and precious truth that He ever bears the profoundest interest in His own -- interest which never fails nor slumbers; which can doubtless allow the trial of persecution if needful, but an interest which, across all, holds the reins in His hand and owns the sufferings of His own for His name as a title of worth for the happiness of the kingdom which will be surely awarded them in its time.<a name=300:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have still some remarks in detail to make.<a name=300:9></a> The Lord takes account of all the circumstances of the life of His own.<a name=300:10></a> The great aim of the parable is to shew that what is done to His servants is done to Himself; but He knows who is hungry, who is in prison, etc.<a name=300:11></a> Nothing escapes Him.<a name=300:12></a> Further, it is well understood that His own suffer, not only now, but at every time during His absence.<a name=300:13></a> Afterwards it is before the Son of man that the nations are summoned to render account of their ways.<a name=300:14></a> Besides the Father judges nobody, but has committed all judgment to the Son.<a name=300:15></a> Here it is the Son of man come and seated on the throne of His glory.<a name=300:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Remark that when He sits on the great white throne to judge the dead (not the living, as here), He does not come at all.<a name=300:17></a> Heaven and earth flee away from before His face.<a name=300:18></a> This is not to come there.<a name=300:19></a> Here, it is, when He comes in His glory (compare Joel 3: 11, et seq.<a name=300:20></a>) that He sits on the throne of His glory and that He gathers the nations.<a name=300:21></a> The blessed put on His right hand are blessed of His Father, but they are children, not companions of the Judge, like the risen and the changed; they do not come with Him; they were mixed up with the goats until the King separated them.<a name=300:22></a> Now this is not true of Christians, for the dead in Christ rise apart, then go to meet Him with those changed.<a name=300:23></a> They are risen in glory.<a name=300:24></a> Jesus, who was their first-fruits in His own resurrection, comes and transforms the body of their humiliation according to the likeness of His glorious body.<a name=300:25></a> Their resurrection is as a thing wholly apart, and alone the faithful go to meet the Lord.<a name=300:26></a> Here He comes to the earth, separates the faithful and condemns the wicked who had despised their brethren, at the same time that He gives to those who had received them (His brethren, the kingdom prepared for them by His Father.<a name=300:27></a> This is not however the kingdom of the Father as in Matthew 13: 43.<a name=300:28></a> Nevertheless all flows from the Father and from His counsels as the source and cause of the blessing.<a name=300:29></a> It is an earthly kingdom, the blessing of which flows from the counsels and the goodness of the Father of Him who was there as Son of man -- a kingdom prepared for them not before, but from the foundation of the world; the result of the government of God here below, but according to the counsels of God.<a name=300:30></a> The fire into which the wicked are to be cast was prepared for the devil and his angels.<a name=300:31></a>

		All that which follows is the solemn testimony that, at this supreme moment, the Saviour, the Victim of atonement, the Lamb destined for the slaughter, the Sheep dumb in the hands of him that shears it, was to find no succour, no refuge, no support for His heart, not one to have compassion on Him though He sought for it.<a name=302:1></a> At the same time His perfection, His grace, are displayed so much the more that He is put to the proof.<a name=302:2></a>

		The death of Jesus being already determined in the unpremeditated council held at the beginning of the night, when He had been brought before Caiaphas, the scribes and the Pharisees held a formal council very early in the morning to pronounce His definite sentence; then they lead Him away to Pilate.<a name=303:1></a> Here we find the iniquity and blindness of all in presence of Him who was about to die.<a name=303:2></a> Judas, who evidently as it seems to me, thought that Jesus would escape them as He had so many times escaped, as long as His hour was not yet come, struck in any case in his conscience at seeing Jesus condemned, comes to the chief priests with the thirty pieces of silver.<a name=303:3></a> Seized with remorse, he declares that he had sinned in betraying the innocent blood.<a name=303:4></a> Little sympathy awaits him there.<a name=303:5></a> They had attained their end; their business had succeeded; as to the sin of Judas, it was his affair.<a name=303:6></a> Such is all the compassion that remorse finds with those who make use of the iniquity that produces it.<a name=303:7></a> The end is attained; and if their instrument is lost for ever, so much the worse for him; it is his business.<a name=303:8></a> They have gained their end.<a name=303:9></a> Judas casts into the temple the silver, poor price of his soul; then goes away to hang himself, sad end of a life passed without conscience near the Lord.<a name=303:10></a> Nothing hardens like this.<a name=303:11></a> The cruel and insolent indifference of the chiefs of Israel, which does not relieve a bad conscience, pushes to suicide this man, who loses his life, his soul, and the money for which he had sold it.<a name=303:12></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#315:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>Down to verse 6 of Mark 16 the same history as that of Matthew is found; in the last verses, that which we read at the end of Luke, and that which is found in John 20. The discourses of chapters 13 and 26 of Acts are connected, as those of Peter, With the mission mentioned in Luke. In the Gospel of Matthew it is not said they were to go and make disciples of the Jews, because the remnant is looked at as already separated from the nation, and associated with Christ. It is a kind of extension of chapter 10 of the same Gospel, where they are forbidden -- at least as to their mission at the moment then present -- to go to the Gentiles, indeed even to the Samaritans, but are told to seek the lost sheep of the house of Israel. Here a wider mission is given them: they are to go and make disciples of the nations. This supposes that the work in the midst of the Jews is other than that of chapter 10, and, in some respects, chapter 24 only explains why the mission which is in question here applies exclusively to the Gentiles. The mission from heaven for the salvation of souls is naturally addressed to the Jews as to the Gentiles. This last is what we find accomplished in Acts: only the part which includes the Gentiles was transferred to Paul, as we have seen.

		The church's portion is heavenly: to be in heaven in spirit now, and when the fulness of times has brought in the accomplishment of God's purposes; to be there, in fact, associated with Christ in the government of the earth.<a name=316:8></a> Her own proper place is the bride and body of Christ.<a name=316:9></a> But the church has also an outward and responsible existence on the earth.<a name=316:10></a> She ought to be the epistle of Christ, known and read of all men; and to present thus the character of God before the world.<a name=316:11></a> In this respect, she is looked at as a responsible dispensation in the world, God's husbandry, God's building, where men may build badly, though the foundation may have been well laid.<a name=316:12></a> Christ will build His own work, through all phases of the church's existence; and have the church, as His house, of which He will be the light and glory, perfect in glory.<a name=316:13></a> Against this work on earth, or its result in heaven, no power of him who has the empire of death can prevail; but, as intrusted to man's responsible service on earth, the church stands in the position of a dispensation: to be rejected and cast off, if it does not maintain its faithfulness and manifest the glory intrusted to it.<a name=316:14></a> It is like all the various ways and dealings of God with men: sinless man at first, the promises, the law, the priesthood, the Jewish royalty in obedience with the law, Gentile supremacy without any, have respectively been trusted to men; man has failed in them all.<a name=316:15></a> All will be set up in grace, in or under Christ.<a name=316:16></a> The last Adam will be there (of which the first was but an image), the promises fulfilled, the law written in the heart, priesthood in its excellency made good, Jewish royalty in the Son of David, supremacy over the Gentiles, in Him who shall rise to reign over them.<a name=316:17></a> The church -- though forming no part of this series of dealings, yet, as the sphere of the manifestation of Christ's heavenly glory, by man's faithfulness on the earth, as the house of God, through the Spirit -- is subject to the same divine law, first of responsibility in man, failure, and divine accomplishment in grace and power.<a name=316:18></a> Local assemblies -- candlesticks -- come under the same rule.<a name=316:19></a> In their normal state, they locally represent the normal state of the church, that which is manifested of Christ's body on earth; but, as is the case with the general assembly, they may be so corrupt as to require that the candlestick should be removed.<a name=316:20></a> There is this difference, that the removal of the candlestick leaves the assembly in general subsisting on the earth; whereas, of course, the closing of the responsibility of the whole assembly removes it as the scene of God's dealings on earth.<a name=316:21></a> Hence, we are sure, that the latter never can take place, till the time for the bride and body of Christ to have a better place in heaven be come also.<a name=316:22></a>

		The Apocalypse reveals to us Christ as Son of God, or Ancient of days, in His divine title of judgment; and it contemplates the judgment of the assembly, and the judgment of the world, particularly of the last apostate power.<a name=317:1></a> In this point of view, we must read it, or we shall never understand it.<a name=317:2></a> Hence the communications are prophetic in their character.<a name=317:3></a> The direct relationships of the Father to His children, and of Christ to His bride and body are not before us; though, at the close, the bride be spoken of in order to identify the city with her.<a name=317:4></a> The saints have the consciousness of the grace in which they stand, as also the church at the end of its own relationship; but these are in no way the subject of the book, but distinguish themselves sharply from it.<a name=317:5></a> The book is prophetic, because it is occupied with government and the world; and the assembly itself is viewed in its responsibility on earth, in which character it will finally be rejected; not surely as the body of Christ united to the Head in heaven.<a name=317:6></a> It is all-important, not only in respect to the Apocalypse but as to truth in general, to enter clearly into this distinction.<a name=317:7></a> Without it the church will never be known; as the knowledge of the church, on the other hand, makes it instantly and necessarily felt.<a name=317:8></a> All belonging to Christ, save His relationship to the church, is found in the Old Testament; this could not be.<a name=317:9></a> All was open, publicly revealed, that concerned Himself.<a name=317:10></a> The church could not be.<a name=317:11></a> It lay at the foundation of the church's existence, that the middle wall should be broken down.<a name=317:12></a> It lay at the very foundation of the existence of Israel and the law, that it should be kept up.<a name=317:13></a> Indeed, the responsibility of the first man would not have been otherwise fully tried.<a name=317:14></a> The church, and our relationship to God, repose on the fact, that that responsibility is closed by our being wholly lost, and a wholly new place taken by the second Man risen from the dead; His work being accepted, and thereupon Himself also accepted and glorified, and we in and because of Him.<a name=317:15></a>

		Paul, who was born out of due time between the first and second comings of Christ, who knew Christ only in the glory in which He was in heaven (man glorified, the result with God of His accomplished work), who was not to know Christ after the flesh, Paul, who was especially apostle of the church, the minister of the church to complete the word of God, who was converted by the revelation of the heavenly glory.<a name=319:1></a> of Christ on one hand, and of the union of the saints with Him so glorified, on the other<a href="#319:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> -- Paul puts us, perfectly accepted, in the glory in Christ, and sees this life in the risen and glorified One, and in us crucified with Him but alive; not "we live, but Christ lives in us.<a name=319:2></a>" But John (and hence the exceeding sweetness of the writings he has given to us by the Holy Ghost) presents the divine person of the Son in life (and that in grace in flesh, divine love shewing itself and the Father), in His blessed superiority to evil, and as divine love does, adapting itself to the want and sorrow around it, to everything the human heart could need, yet light all through.<a name=319:3></a> We do not get man taken up to heaven, so to speak, in John; but we get God Himself in grace, the Son revealing the Father down on earth.<a name=319:4></a> The Gospel -- and Epistle, as we have seen, reveal this life in itself or in us; but the Gospel (for the Epistle gives us the life between the departure and return of the Lord) gives us at the end a hint of the apostle holding on a testimony to the coming of Christ.<a name=319:5></a> He did not say he should not die; but if He would that he tarried till He came.<a name=319:6></a> Paul might build the church, or lay its foundation as a wise master-builder; Peter might teach a pilgrim how to follow Him that was risen, and had begotten Him again to a lively hope by it -- how to follow his Master through the wilderness, in which, after all, God still governed.<a name=319:7></a> These, and others, warn too of coming evils.<a name=319:8></a> But he, who was so personally near to Christ (Jewish in his relationships and full of them, but in whose eyes, at the same time as taught of God, [Christ was] a person who was, in Himself, above all relationship, save with the Father, and who had a place in which He could be in the Father's bosom, yet walk as Man, in the title and manifestation of the Son, upon earth, and withal a place in John's heart; through grace, which attached him to His person, and life in it); such an one (and such an one was John, the disciple whom Jesus loved) could watch, with the power of divine love, over the departing glories of the church on earth in the energy of a life which could not fail in it.<a name=319:9></a> And he could pass on with prophetic vision to establish the rights of the same person (out of and on the part of heaven, yet still on earth; rights, whose establishment should bring peace on the earth, and set aside the evil, and make these rights good, where the prophet had seen them despised, in One he so loved, as manifested on earth, and connect the excellency of the glorified Sufferer with the blessing of a rescued world, which grace could bless through Him, though it had once rejected Him.<a name=319:10></a> The way of bringing about this, with the failing church's previous history, is what is given us in the Apocalypse, with the prophetically known person and glory of Christ connecting itself, first with the responsible assembly on earth, though then judicially, and then with the earth.<a name=319:11></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#319:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>Although this doctrine is found in many parts of Paul's writings, it may be interesting to remark, that though in God's plans (chapter 8) he sees us glorified, and Christ in heaven interceding -- in doctrine, the Romans presents man as a sinner and Christ only risen so that the individual is justified -- not the church, save in relative duties. In Ephesians, on the contrary, he does not see Christ living on earth, nor us as living in sin, save, as alluding to it as a past history, when speaking of practice. Christ is first seen as dead, and God has raised Him and set Him above all: we, dead in sins, and God has raised us with Him. Hence, it is wholly a new *creation*, absolute relationships, according to this. Hence, we have the church, and our place before God, as Christ now has it.

A closer examination of the churches will lead us to see that in the four first, where there is blame (in the epistle to Smyrna there is none) and threatened judgment, the threat is to be executed not on the angel, but on the candlestick in Ephesus or on the guilty parties, as in Pergamos and in Thyatira. But in the three last it is not so. in Philadelphia there is no blame; and here, as in Smyrna, the angel and the church are not distinguished in the address itself; but in Sardis and in Laodicea the threatenings are continued as a part of the address to the angel himself. This, I suppose, connects itself' with the distinction already made between these two classes of churches; the four first have a definite church-place, and the angel, that part which in God's sight really represented the church, is abidingly owned at all events, and the judgment is on the inconsistent part, or what falsified the public testimony. But, when we come to Sardis, we go back (for Thyatira goes on to the end); when speaking of the mass, the better and witnessing part comes out as witness, witness against Jezebel; if they are not a witness they are nothing at all. The corporate constitution is null here. Hence, if there be failure, the whole thing fails and is judged with the world, and any faithful ones become a distinctive blessed remnant; because faithful witness is the whole thing. Hence, when Christ has to become that, the church so ruined is to be spued out of His mouth.

		I have remarked elsewhere the extreme importance of this threat.<a name=343:1></a> Because it is directly declared in 1 Thessalonians 5 that those whom the Lord owns as Christians would not be so treated; "Ye are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief" And they are exhorted to watch.<a name=343:2></a> But on the world that day would come unawares, as travail on a woman with child.<a name=343:3></a> The professing church, in its Sardis state, would be treated as the world if it did not watch.<a name=343:4></a> Not only is the judgment most solemn, but it shews that the spiritual judgment, that professing Christianity in this state is (morally speaking) the world in God's sight, is just.<a name=343:5></a> And note, here, that if we connect (as we should) 1 Thessalonians 5: 1, with chapter 4: 14, this judgment will take place when the saints come with Jesus.<a name=343:6></a> Protestantism, for such I doubt not it is, sad as the thought may be, will be found and judged as the world at Christ's coming with the saints.<a name=343:7></a> It is not terrible tribulation and special judgment as with Thyatira, but found to be the world.<a name=343:8></a> Here, too, the true saints are treated as a remnant.<a name=343:9></a> "Thou hast a few names in Sardis who have not defiled their garments.<a name=343:10></a>" They had practical <i>christian</i> walk.<a name=343:11></a> The white linen is the righteousness of the saints.<a name=343:12></a> "They shall walk with me in white.<a name=343:13></a>" The church's works were not complete before Christ's God.<a name=343:14></a> There was a lack of what was properly Christian in them.<a name=343:15></a> Those who kept themselves in their walk as Christians would walk with Him in white.<a name=343:16></a> The same is repeated to him that overcomes, with the addition that he would not be struck out of the registers of God's people.<a name=343:17></a> When the once nominal church was treated as the world in judgment, it would not be even in the register.<a name=343:18></a> All professing Christians are, and in that sense, in the book of life.<a name=343:19></a> They have not life, surely, unless born of God, but they all stand on the public registry of life; a Jew, a Mahommedan, an open apostate, does not.<a name=343:20></a> When the saints were gone, and the nominal body visited as the world, that would have no real meaning, perhaps no nominal existence.<a name=343:21></a> The saint, faithful while it went on, would not lose his place on the register.<a name=343:22></a> Christ would confess his name as really His before His Father, and before His Father's angels.<a name=343:23></a> Here we have the saints very definitely individualised as to Christ's owning them, and in contrast with the professing church judged as the world below, confessed by Christ above in the presence of His Father and His angels.<a name=343:24></a> The warning to hear, as in Thyatira, comes after this distinction.<a name=343:25></a>

		Two evils were before the eye of the Spirit in these times: -- the synagogue of Satan, those who founded religion on ordinances and not on Christ: a present and pretentious evil -- "they say.<a name=346:1></a>" The other a judgment of the Lord Himself, the hour of temptation which was coming on the whole world to try those attached to the earth, as it had been formed under the eye of God.<a name=346:2></a> As to the first, their judgment, after all, was light, but a great strength to the saints; who might seem to act for themselves, and despise the old traditions and truths, or what were said to be such, sanctioned for ages.<a name=346:3></a> They would be brought to own, by God's ways and dealings, that it was those who had little strength but were faithful to Christ, His word and name, whom He loved.<a name=346:4></a> They would have to come and bow before the feet of the despised remnant of faithful ones, weak as they might have been, and to confess, at any rate, that Christ had loved them.<a name=346:5></a> And this is what contents and satisfies the heart -- the approbation and the love of Christ.<a name=346:6></a> This is what is presented by Christ, and what constitutes the ruling principle of the heart of the faithful here.<a name=346:7></a>

		The first point, then, was Jewish principles invading the church outside her Jezebel character; that is, ordinances, traditions, and human authority in contrast with Christ.<a name=346:8></a> The second is connected with the consciousness that the world is going on to a scene of confusion and judgment, a time of universal trial.<a name=346:9></a> In the light in which Philadelphia stands, this is clear to those who have the understanding given by the Spirit of God.<a name=346:10></a> Christ is coming.<a name=346:11></a> <i>Christ</i> has to be confessed and held to fast, when all principle is loosed, God setting an open door before faith, but the world itself uneasy.<a name=346:12></a> The saints who hear with the ear given to faith will escape the hour of temptation.<a name=346:13></a> The reason is given.<a name=346:14></a> Christ is waiting for His allotted crown, and maintains His exclusive heavenly character, till He rises up from His Father's throne.<a name=346:15></a>

		The prophet is called up to heaven; for no government of God was yet manifested on the earth, and the church was no longer owned as witness; and the first voice which he had heard as a trumpet, the voice of the Alpha and Omega, the First and the Last, the voice of Him who was behind him in the midst of the golden candlesticks, now called him up to where His power and activity was to display itself -- the Ancient of days, whom we shall now first have to see on the throne; but whom we shall also perceive as a distinct person as the Lamb.<a name=351:7></a> We have a throne in heaven, instead of candlesticks upon the earth.<a name=351:8></a> In the "things after these," or hereafter, we find evidently the last part of the verse which gives the division of the book; and, whether translated "after these" or "hereafter," the sense is the same; as the preceding things were "the things that are.<a name=351:9></a>" The judgment of Daniel 7 is here largely developed.<a name=351:10></a> The jasper is divine display.<a name=351:11></a> I go no farther.<a name=351:12></a> It is not essential nature, though this be what is displayed; but display of divine glory in government and judgment -- what secures and protects from evil.<a name=351:13></a> I say this merely from its use, not from any notion as to the stone.<a name=351:14></a> (Compare chapter 21: 18, 19, and 11.<a name=351:15></a>) It characterises divine display thus in the book.<a name=351:16></a> The rainbow is covenant with creation.<a name=351:17></a> The throne thus gives the government which secures from evil and blesses creation.<a name=351:18></a> The saints, kings and priests, are seen in glory, enthroned and crowned as kings here (in the next chapter, priests), and decked with the ornament of righteousnesses in life.<a name=351:19></a> The throne was one of majesty and judgment (not of grace) Sinai-like, and before it the perfection of attributive power; the seven Spirits of God were seen.<a name=351:20></a> And that which erst was the means of feet-washing, and cleansing before judgment came in, was now solid purity on which cleansed ones could walk and find no uncleanness to take up.<a name=351:21></a> The cherubim (four not two, completeness, not witness) were in the midst of the throne and around it, characterised it in its inward nature, and surrounded<a href="#351:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> it with what was their peculiar character.<a name=351:22></a> That character is judicial power, as I have elsewhere remarked, and as all the cases, in which they appear, shew.<a name=351:23></a>

		Here, the beasts and elders, the heavenly saints, I apprehend, in their double character of heads of creation, and kings and priests, exercise distinctly the office of priests, not in interceding, but in offering up the prayers of the saints.<a name=355:1></a> The intelligence of the elders, the saints, viewed in this character of priests brought near to God, whose lips keep knowledge, celebrate the Lamb as worthy to take the book, and open the seals, and why He is so; namely, that He has gone through death and wrought redemption -- redeemed to God.<a name=355:2></a> I suppose the "us" is justly rejected.<a name=355:3></a> It is not <i>who</i> are redeemed that makes Him worthy; but that He has redeemed people to God out of every nation, and made them kings and priests, and that they will reign.<a name=355:4></a> It is His work, and its effect and character, that make Him worthy.<a name=355:5></a> Who should open that book of the kingdom, or the ways of God in bringing it in, but He who had brought it into existence and all in it, by sacrificing Himself?<a name=355:6></a> And here the angels come in with willing chorus in a beautiful way, owning the effect of this work, and standing farther off, but in the best of places since it was the one that owned and gave glory to the Lamb in His work.<a name=355:7></a> They stood in a circle around the throne and the beasts and the elders.<a name=355:8></a> So every creature joined in the chorus.<a name=355:9></a> And the four beasts say "Amen" to the creature.<a name=355:10></a> It was their place.<a name=355:11></a> The twenty-four elders fall down and worship.<a name=355:12></a> This is their own worship.<a name=355:13></a> It is more than the "Amen" of the beasts to the praise of the creation.<a name=355:14></a> This, though we have made progress as to the facts in the prophetic history (for the book has been now taken by the Lamb in order to open it), yet gives an anticipative expression to universal praise.<a name=355:15></a> John hears it prophetically.<a name=355:16></a> The twenty-four elders and beasts made part of the subsisting glory from which all was to follow -- crowned and enthroned before there was any history.<a name=355:17></a>

		The judgment on the beast's throne (fifth vial) is felt in the extent of his empire.<a name=387:1></a> His enterprises are not arrested, but his kingdom is full of darkness, and "they paw their tongues for pain.<a name=387:2></a>" And now the forces are gathered for the great final battle of good and evil.<a name=387:3></a> The principle of Satan's power as the enemy of Christ in the Latin empire -- the renewed form of imperial power -- and the false Messiah in Palestine, a prophet-king -- are the sources of this gathering power.<a name=387:4></a> They promote and proclaim the principles that gather.<a name=387:5></a> It is a notable fact here that the excessively miserable state of the beast's kingdom does not hinder his pushing his war against the Lamb.<a name=387:6></a> Under the influence of these three spirits of evil the apostate armies are gathered to the battle of the great day of God Almighty, the final conflict of good and evil -- heaven and earth.<a name=387:7></a> I suppose Armageddon refers to judges 5: 19, 20.<a name=387:8></a> This gives occasion to the solemn warning to the world that the Lord was just coming as a thief.<a name=387:9></a> When the seventh vial is poured out, there was a universal subversive convulsion, such as never had been in the world.<a name=387:10></a> And the great city, the public confederation of the civilised earth was broken up into three parts; and Babylon came into remembrance, to give her the cup of the fierceness of God's wrath.<a name=387:11></a> The details of her judgment are in chapter 18.<a name=387:12></a> Men were plagued with the terrible judgments of God falling on them; but they only blasphemed His name.<a name=387:13></a> We have three parts of the effect of this final judgment of God: the city is divided into three, the cities of the nations fall, and Babylon comes into remembrance.<a name=387:14></a> The great city I have alluded to is the practically unified association of European civilisation; the other centres of social life fell.<a name=387:15></a> Babylon is the third.<a name=387:16></a> It is more particularly Western civilisation viewed in connection with its corrupt religious side.<a name=387:17></a>

		We are now arrived at the important chapters which describe the connection of Babylon with the beast, and the destruction of the former.<a name=387:18></a> One of the ministers of God's judgments calls the prophet to see the judgment of the great whore who sits on many waters, that is, the grand corruptress of religion, who turns away souls from the truth of God, exercising widespread influence over the masses of population.<a name=387:19></a> The kings of the earth had had intercourse with her, cultivated it in this prostitution of Christianity; and the inhabitants of the earth -- those settled in the sphere of the civilised order where God's ways and dealings were known, had been mentally steeped, besotted with this corruption of Christianity.<a name=387:20></a> Rich as all was to man's eye, and pious, and religious, to the Spirit all was wilderness, desolation, and drought -- anything but the garden of God.<a name=387:21></a> She sits on a scarlet-coloured beast, the imperial Roman power in its last blasphemous form.<a name=387:22></a> She herself was enriched with luxury, power, and splendour; in her hand a cup of gold, full of that with which she corrupted and made drunk the earth.<a name=387:23></a> To a spiritual eye her character was stamped upon her forehead, though a mystery to those who were not.<a name=387:24></a> She was judged, however, as a mystery by the spiritual man; that is, he was spiritual enough to judge hers -- how, if unrevealed, her true character was not understood.<a name=387:25></a> She was the heir, as the great moral characterising capital of the world, of that great city, which first was the seat of idolatry antagonistic of the true God, the fertile source of all corruptions of primitive Christianity, and of all idolatries in the earth.<a name=387:26></a> She was drunk with the blood of persecution in a double character; first of saints, and then of the witnesses of Jesus.<a name=387:27></a> This was the character of her who rode.<a name=387:28></a> The riding it, or the time of that, was a distinct thing -- the saints she could not bear the witnesses of Jesus she could not bear.<a name=387:29></a> The prophet was astonished at seeing her.<a name=387:30></a> This astonishment clearly intimates, I think, something special and extraordinary.<a name=387:31></a> And so it is, that what should call itself the church should be drunk with the blood of the saints.<a name=387:32></a> The foolish notion of the rationalists (and what have they taught, that is not foolishness?<a name=387:33></a>) that all this is the history of Pagan Rome, makes this astonishment without any sense.<a name=387:34></a> It is Rome, but Rome under special circumstances.<a name=387:35></a>

		Here the reader will remark what aids us in the apprehension of these symbols, that the beast, now that the explanation is given to the prophet, wholly fills this scene.<a name=388:1></a> At the close, we find the destruction of the woman, and who she is.<a name=388:2></a> Her name at the beginning of the chapter had fully told what she was; her own character as such, independent of the beast, though seen sitting on the beast.<a name=388:3></a> Verses 5 and 6 give the proper character of the woman herself.<a name=388:4></a> When I come to the history of the beast, though identified with the whole Roman empire, I get the special history of its last form -- of the very last days, and of the fact that, as beast it had ceased to exist, yet was found again.<a name=388:5></a> The woman may have been all that she was described in verses 5, 6, while the beast was not.<a name=388:6></a>

		But we have now to consider the beast in its full description, as seen at the end.<a name=389:1></a> The beast carries her.<a name=389:2></a> No doubt she thus exercises influence over him, but it is not her strength.<a name=389:3></a> She sits on him, but he carries her; and to the beast the prophet now at once turns.<a name=389:4></a> It is the seven-headed ten-horned beast, known as the old Roman but now ten-horned beast.<a name=389:5></a> But its character is followed out more precisely.<a name=389:6></a> It was -- is not and is going to ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into destruction.<a name=389:7></a> It had been, it had ceased to exist, and at the end it would ascend out of the bottomless pit -- have a distinctly devilish character.<a name=389:8></a> In this it is we have seen him persecute and slay the witnesses; in this he goes into destruction.<a name=389:9></a> The deadly wound the beast had received in one of his heads was healed, but now he was in his last form going into perdition.<a name=389:10></a> All but the elect pay homage to him in this last form, seeing the beast, which had ceased to exist, now present again.<a name=389:11></a> This gives in general, the history and character of the beast.<a name=389:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there are more particulars as to the heads.<a name=389:13></a> The seven heads have a double application: first they are seven mountains, on which the woman sits.<a name=389:14></a> We may learn here how, while giving much more light as to facts, a symbol cannot be literally taken.<a name=389:15></a> The woman was sitting on the beast.<a name=389:16></a> So Rome is seated on seven hills, as well as on the Roman empire by its influence.<a name=389:17></a> But, besides this, the heads of the beast were seven forms of power which characterised it.<a name=389:18></a> Five had already passed away when the angel spoke to the prophet; one was existing, the imperial form.<a name=389:19></a> Another was to come and subsist for only a short time (perhaps Napoleon I; in the protracted system, Charlemagne); and then an extra head, the last beast, but which is the same as one of the seven; in which form the head and beast, and all is destroyed.<a name=389:20></a> Seven complete the <i>form</i>.<a name=389:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the beast that reappears after ceasing to exist, the renewed Roman empire, with its confederate vassal kingdoms, is a distinct and special existence of the beast, a resurrection form of the Roman empire come out of the bottomless pit, Satanic -- a substantial devilish existence, in which, though peculiar in form, the Roman empire reappeared, that is, the Western, as the <i>empire</i> historically was.<a name=389:22></a> In this state the beast would be destroyed.<a name=389:23></a> The ten horns did not exist at the time the vision was given, but would subsist one same period with the beast the prophet had before his eyes, that is, the beast in his last Roman form.<a name=389:24></a> These ten kingdoms would give their power and influence to the beast -- would exist, but play entirely into his hands.<a name=389:25></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But this brings us to a point of the greatest importance.<a name=390:1></a> The formation of this beast, the empire or imperial head of power with the ten helping kingdoms, brings evil up to the point of open war on the part of the kingdoms, with the Lamb who now appears again.<a name=390:2></a> Here the kings are mentioned as making war, because the object is to give the character at this time of the great body of nations which form Western Europe.<a name=390:3></a> In the end of chapter 19 we find the beast who is at their head engaged in the war, but the ten kingdoms shall make war with the Lamb.<a name=390:4></a> But the Lamb shall overcome them, for He is King of kings and Lord of lords.<a name=390:5></a> Here we have, not the governmental dealings of God by angelic power, or in a providential way, but the Lamb Himself manifesting His power to the destruction of those who rise up against Him.<a name=390:6></a> But He is not alone.<a name=390:7></a> They that are with Him are called, chosen, faithful -- the saints of God, not angels (though they may be too); angels are not called -- with this war they have not to do.<a name=390:8></a> Of the waters we have already spoken.<a name=390:9></a> It is the influence of Rome over the populations.<a name=390:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Finally, the ten horns and the beast shall hate the whore, make her desolate and naked, and eat her flesh and burn her with fire.<a name=390:11></a> I think that this statement marks that the beast and the kingdoms' dealings with her are not instantaneous destruction in an historical point of view.<a name=390:12></a> God's final judgment at the end may be.<a name=390:13></a> They hate her.<a name=390:14></a> It is a change of mind and feeling which takes place as to her, and makes desolate and naked.<a name=390:15></a> There is progress in this: they deal actively with her; next they eat her flesh.<a name=390:16></a> This is more -- they make her contemptible, expose her first; then deprive of her wealth and possessions, what formed her personal body; finally destroy herself, burn her with fire.<a name=390:17></a> They join the beast in this.<a name=390:18></a> Their mind, what was unnatural for these kingdoms, which might have been jealous of the beast, is governed by God, to unite all of them to give their kingdom and power to the beast; but this was not giving it to the woman.<a name=390:19></a> And the beast, being a power on his own score, they join in destroying the whore.<a name=390:20></a> The prophet then states in the distinctest language that it was Rome.<a name=390:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I think, then, that the statements as to Babylon imply a human desertion and confiscation of wealth first, and then the utter destruction.<a name=391:1></a> To this, I judge, chapter 18 answers.<a name=391:2></a> It is a distinct vision; the display of power, not Christ, God's instrumental glory, yet signally displayed -- he had great power, and the earth was lightened with his glory.<a name=391:3></a> The second verse, I apprehend, to be, not the finally utter destruction of what had been glorious Babylon, though anticipative of it in her evidently losing her pre-eminent place and fair show.<a name=391:4></a> "Babylon is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit.<a name=391:5></a>" This was not yet her ceasing to exist, though to exist in power and rule it was.<a name=391:6></a> Yet, I apprehend, this is only the general announcement of her judgment, when she loses her place of power; just as in chapter 12 salvation and the kingdom was announced when Satan was precipitated from heaven.<a name=391:7></a> She had had the supremacy, by her idolatries and fornications, over the beast and the horns; she was now a cast-off harlot, degraded and fallen; and the beast is the leading power.<a name=391:8></a> The details then follow, where her burning with fire is not the first and immediate thing.<a name=391:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But before the final judgment (but I think, applicable at all times, when the character of Babylon is spiritually seen), God's people are urgently called to come out of her, that they may not partake in her sins, and so in her plagues.<a name=391:10></a> Hence, I think, the absence of precision is notable here, and like all difficulties in scripture, introductory to light.<a name=391:11></a> The time of destruction is precise enough.<a name=391:12></a> It is at the close of God's judgments, and before the coming forth of the Lamb.<a name=391:13></a> It is when the seventh angel has poured his vial into the air, for final judgment on the part of God (chapter 16: 17-19), and before the rising up of the beast and his armies against the Lamb coming from heaven as King of kings and Lord of lords.<a name=391:14></a> But the woman, as to her place and seat, could be pointed out to John <i>then:</i> not her state (chapter 17: 18).<a name=391:15></a> And if there was spirituality enough to discern, the mystery could be left (perhaps at the expense of life -- all the blood of saints was found in her) at all times; chapter 18: 4.<a name=391:16></a>

		But there is a special character and special time, the character that she rides the beast with seven heads and ten horns.<a name=392:1></a> A long while she contended, so to speak, with the beast, or it was wounded to death, and she took practically its place.<a name=392:2></a> Towards the end (having seduced the horns for years and centuries -- her habitual character -- and made the people drunk), she rides the beast, the beast having taken a blasphemous character, the woman drunken with the blood of saints.<a name=392:3></a> The beast had been, was not, and then appears again.<a name=392:4></a> The elements may have been there before, but when the subject of the vision is complete, you have ten horns during the same period with the beast, and at first the woman riding it, I suppose in this state, but I am not yet quite clear upon this point, when the beast has ascended out of the bottomless pit, that is, is directly under the guidance and influence of Satan.<a name=392:5></a> At first I have said, the woman rides the beast; but <i>this</i> changes, she loses her influence and power, and is deprived of her wealth and everything, and destroyed; and the beast acts, the horns having done with the woman, giving all their power to the beast in open opposition to the Lamb.<a name=392:6></a> The heavenly voice must be heard to get out of Babylon.<a name=392:7></a>

		We may remark, that the saints are seen here entirely on governmental and, in this sense, Jewish grounds.<a name=392:8></a> Not that they are Jews; I speak of the spirit.<a name=392:9></a> They are called out to execute wrath.<a name=392:10></a> I do not at all believe any saints on earth do this work.<a name=392:11></a> Here the horns and the beast do it.<a name=392:12></a> But these judgments are the avenging of God's people, their cry has brought it.<a name=392:13></a> They rejoice in it as righteous judgment in their favour.<a name=392:14></a> Verse 6 is not, I think, an appeal to the saints to act necessarily (the "you" is left out after "rewarded"), but it is in the mind of the prophet in thinking of them.<a name=392:15></a> Evil comes suddenly on Babylon, though her burning is not the first thing; still I doubt not it is very rapid; famine for one literal day would not be much, but it comes in one day -- "and she shall be burned with fire.<a name=392:16></a>" The cry of this self-styled civilised world -- all the classes of modern civilisation -- is, however, on her burning.<a name=392:17></a> The ten horns are the ten kingdoms.<a name=392:18></a> The ten kings are the kings of those kingdoms which had committed fornication with her; these mourn, as all those interested in modern civilisation.<a name=392:19></a> The fall and the final ruin of this great system, of which Rome was the centre, is a grief and pain to them.<a name=392:20></a> The apostles and prophets rejoice: God has avenged them on her.<a name=392:21></a> Terrible judgment for her who had professed alone to have their teaching!<a name=392:22></a> Babylon would be violently thrown down, and not found any more.<a name=392:23></a> This is in allusion to Jeremiah 51, which I refer to as shewing that it is met by ordinary providential judgment -- here perhaps, more summarily than ancient Babylon.<a name=392:24></a> Note the whole system of Western papal Europe is not punished for, but in, its wealth and civilisation.<a name=392:25></a>

		No doubt this slighted Christianity had an apostate character -- would order and moralise and embellish the world excluding Christ; but the idolatrous character of Rome was the cause of judgment.<a name=393:1></a> The nations, deceived by her sorceries, had turned wholly to this world, and their moral condition was met by a judgment falling on this state of civilisation and prosperity.<a name=393:2></a> There is no judgment on the merchants and kings and navigators; but they mourn the loss of the great city.<a name=393:3></a> The system is all broken up with her.<a name=393:4></a> The royal commercial civilised world falls with the upset of Rome, the people's power not: but it is given to the beast.<a name=393:5></a>

		This closes the book.<a name=404:1></a> There are, however, concluding observations, besides what is said to the church, from verse 16, which require some notice.<a name=404:2></a> The angel declares the truth of all this, and adds, the Lord God has sent His angel to show to His servants things that must shortly come to pass.<a name=404:3></a> This last expression must be noticed.<a name=404:4></a> It is one of the difficulties of the book.<a name=404:5></a> The same expression is used in the first verse.<a name=404:6></a> But I do not think that the whole key to the expression is in the fact that it begins with Ephesus and is a whole.<a name=404:7></a> In God's mind the church had failed as a witness.<a name=404:8></a> The time was come for judgment to begin at the house of God.<a name=404:9></a> Hence whatever the patience of God, there was no more time recognised till judgment was executed, save 1260 days which belong in fact to a period marked out in Jewish chronology.<a name=404:10></a> Perhaps I should say, that the church which belongs to heaven having lost this character and left its first love, and Christ having hence taken a judicial character in view of its earthly testimony, the time of taking up computed time and judgment was a question of divine patience -- might be at any moment there.<a name=404:11></a> If it were not, it was grace, working as long as love could produce blessing, while all was, in spite of mercy, ripening for judgment.<a name=404:12></a> But the Lord warns that He was coming quickly -- "Blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book.<a name=404:13></a>"

		Here again, we may apply all the book, provided we see the church in its responsibility, and not in its connection with Christ as its Head.<a name=405:1></a> Christ is viewed as coming in reference to responsibility.<a name=405:2></a> To such prophecy applies -- the hope of His coming to receive us up is another thing.<a name=405:3></a> It is hope, not responsibility and warning.<a name=405:4></a> His coming, in connection with responsibility, is always His appearing; and the church, though doubtless saved and coming with Him, stands on the same ground as the world, that is, of the consequences of its conduct.<a name=405:5></a> Hence the difference is not made here, though from chapter 4 the book be more directly prophetic.<a name=405:6></a> This verse applies to those who have the book.<a name=405:7></a> The testifying angel again rejects the proffered worship.<a name=405:8></a> Surely this has reference to the time the book treats of when the very position of the church as connected with the Head being out of view, holding the Head by Christians would tend to give place to excessive reverence for the higher instruments of God's government, in whom He used to reveal Himself, and above which the minds of Christians did not go.<a name=405:9></a> In both cases here the worship was proffered when the witness has closed, saying -- "These are the true sayings of God.<a name=405:10></a>" But the angel does more than refuse the worship: he is a fellow servant, the prophet is to worship God.<a name=405:11></a> Now God has ceased thus to reveal Himself angelically.<a name=405:12></a> Not only has God alone the title to be worshipped, but it in <i>man</i> He has revealed Himself.<a name=405:13></a> We know this by faith.<a name=405:14></a>

		The close of this book contemplates its public manifestation.<a name=405:15></a> The angels have their own known place for the Christian in service, as creatures of course, not objects of worship, not the beings or form in which God reveals Himself, never mediatorial intercessors and not for the Christian those in whom God is seen; and, once Christ is glorified as man, not even administrative authorities though ever willing servants.<a name=405:16></a> God I worship, Christ I worship, because He is God and Lord.<a name=405:17></a> In Him God is perfectly revealed.<a name=405:18></a> He with the saints, that is, Redeemer, Ruler, will govern and inherit all things.<a name=405:19></a> All here, even the prophet, are servants.<a name=405:20></a> The sayings of this book were not to be sealed as Daniel's were.<a name=405:21></a> That was in place.<a name=405:22></a> The fulfilment was to come out in the last days.<a name=405:23></a> Between, all the wonderful church or heavenly system was to come in, and what was .<a name=405:24></a>revealed was to be sealed till this; and the decay of this on earth, which let in these earthly ways of God again, had made it timely by the speedy taking up again of these ways.<a name=405:25></a> Now that is exactly what we have here.<a name=405:26></a> The professing church got into the place of judgment and the divine preparation made, the Lamb being seen in the throne and opening the book, for the fulfilling the things which had to be sealed in Daniel's time.<a name=405:27></a> Hence the book was not to be sealed, for the time is at hand.<a name=405:28></a> The time in view in it was not that of restoring grace, of the gospel but of judgment, of man's responsibility, in which there is no change in man.<a name=405:29></a> Even in the churches, which is not the strictly prophetic part of the book, those who hear and are righteous in the churches, are directed and guided in the way, but supposed to be already righteous.<a name=405:30></a> Still, here, I doubt not the closing scenes are looked to, and the saints to whom the prophecy is addressed, as already such.<a name=405:31></a>

		The Lord was coming to judge, and quickly.<a name=406:1></a> Verse 7 addresses itself in warning to those engaged in the circumstances of the book itself, and the things are shortly to be done.<a name=406:2></a> Here, in verses 10-14, all is closed.<a name=406:3></a> The Lord is coming to judge every one according to their works, and their state is viewed as a fixed one.<a name=406:4></a> Hence, in verse 13, He closes all with His own nature, as First and Last.<a name=406:5></a> Verses 14, 15, need not be confined, I apprehend, to those who form the city itself, but include all those who, having washed their robes (I think <i>Codex Sinaiticus</i> has confirmed this reading), have the right to the of life, and enter in through the gates of pearl into the city: redemption, leading to life, and fitting for a state lovely in grace in Christ's eyes, what meets the entering person at once, and for association with divine holiness and righteousness.<a name=406:6></a> This, even the blood of Christ and the sanctification of the Spirit, is the foundation of the blessing of all who are blessed.<a name=406:7></a> Without are the evil and the violent, the corrupt and the idolatrous.<a name=406:8></a> In chapter 21: 8 it is final judgment; here it is exclusion.<a name=406:9></a>

		This wholly closes the book; and Jesus presents Himself as such to the prophet, as revealing all this for the churches.<a name=406:10></a> He comes personally forward, still in connection of course with the subject of the book, as the Source and Heir of the promises of Israel, and as the One known to the faith of the church and none else -- a heavenly One, not the day for this world, but the Bright and Morning Star for those who watch in the night.<a name=406:11></a> Whatever the state of the professing church might be, this remained true and bright for hope, and the brighter, the darker all seemed to be.<a name=406:12></a> It is no announcement of coming or warning now, but Christ's announcing Himself, "I, Jesus" announcing what He is for the Jews, and what He is for the church.<a name=406:13></a> When what He is for the church, her special portion in Him, is named, all the affection of the church in her own relationship is awakened: indeed what love produced in her in ever respect, as animated by the Spirit which dwells in her.<a name=406:14></a> Indeed He is first named.<a name=406:15></a> The position of the church is this: she has the Spirit, and longs for Christ.<a name=406:16></a> "The Spirit and the bride say, Come.<a name=406:17></a>" It is not merely affection or a wish, but the mind of the Spirit as down here on the earth.<a name=406:18></a>

		The church looks for Christ, for Himself and herself, in the consciousness of her own relationship.<a name=407:1></a> No doubt, it will be blessing for the world.<a name=407:2></a> That, she enters into and delights in; but Christ Himself is before her mind.<a name=407:3></a> Thus her heart, or the Spirit speaking in the prophet as associated personally with her in position and testimony, turns round in love, first to him who hears; let him who has received the testimony of Jesus say "Come.<a name=407:4></a>" That is the thing to desire.<a name=407:5></a> After Christ Himself, the Spirit first turns to them that are His; then to any one who has an awakened desire and need of soul, "Let him that is athirst"; then in the power of that love with which the church is filled, and with which the Spirit works, "Whosoever will, let him take of the water of life freely.<a name=407:6></a>" The church longs for Christ, but she has the full stream of life already.<a name=407:7></a> She says to every soul, "Whosoever will, let him come"; not to <i>me</i>, as Jesus alone could.<a name=407:8></a> Still she possesses the water, and invites to come as freely as she has enjoyed.<a name=407:9></a> In a word, we get the full place of the church and her testimony while waiting for Christ, and for nothing else, and thus for Him directly.<a name=407:10></a> This desire the Lord meets then.<a name=407:11></a> "He which testifieth these things, saith, Surely I come quickly"; and this satisfies the heart of the saints.<a name=407:12></a> "Amen, even so, come, Lord Jesus.<a name=407:13></a>" A solemn sanction is added to the authority of the book, and to maintain its integrity.<a name=407:14></a> The book of life is not life, but the presumed and apparent possession of it as inscribed among professing Christians.<a name=407:15></a>

		I have thus attempted a sketch of the book in its structure and meaning.<a name=407:16></a> To complete this, something might be said of its historical application, at least as warning as to the present time, and perhaps something of a vocabulary of symbolical language.<a name=407:17></a>
