		[C Crain] MY DEAR BROTHER, I was very glad to get your letter, and get news of the dear brethren around you.<a name=1:1></a> I trust, too, from them that the Lord is carrying on His work.<a name=1:2></a> With us numbers have largely increased, and there have been a good many conversions: but the increase of numbers has tended to lower the barrier against the world, and the very lapse of time, for it always tends to come in imperceptibly; it weakens, too, the competency to deal with evil when it arises.<a name=1:3></a> I have long felt that Satan was making a dead set at brethren in this respect, but was anxious not to go before the Lord, but wait on Him, and did.<a name=1:4></a> It brought on a crisis in London, but God came in most graciously; not that they are wholly out of it yet.<a name=1:5></a> But God has stepped in, and He will, if the brethren are humble, complete His work, and I do not doubt it will be very useful.<a name=1:6></a> Out of London, it has been an occasion of sorrow, but has not so much affected them directly.<a name=1:7></a> He is ever faithful.<a name=1:8></a>

		I am engaged in translating the Old Testament into French: we are towards the end, but it will have to be revised.<a name=1:9></a> It has been a laborious work, and it is not the way of reading scripture that nourishes; still it instructs, and makes one's knowledge of it accurate in detail.<a name=1:10></a> It is for others substantially I do it, as is evident.<a name=1:11></a> But scripture, and the infinite preciousness of Christ, opens to me more and more: His preciousness is infinite, and yet how near; what comfort in passing through the wilderness!<a name=1:12></a> "I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.<a name=1:13></a>" We must seek to realise these things: how little we believe they are real facts.<a name=1:14></a>

		Have you weighed how Romans is man on earth, as we all are, but full grace towards him, chapter 5: 1-11; then reckoning himself dead (not risen), but Christ his life and he in Him, and Christ in him; experimental, chapter 5: 12 to end of chapter 8.<a name=1:15></a> Colossians dead and risen, but on the earth; his hope in heaven and his affections aright; but the presence of the Holy Ghost not the subject.<a name=1:16></a> Ephesians on quite other ground (alluded to partially once in Colossians and 2 Corinthians 5) -- not dead to sin, but dead in sins, and sovereign grace putting us into Christ where He is so that we are sitting there; our new place and relationships.<a name=1:17></a> Colossians is fitness for the place.<a name=1:18></a> Ephesians the presence of the Holy Ghost fully recognised and spoken of; not experience but contrast of the two conditions.<a name=1:19></a> This is only for you to search into.<a name=1:20></a> Its connection with figures from Egypt to Canaan would be more than I could go into here.<a name=1:21></a> Love to all the brethren: may they be kept from the spirit of the world.<a name=1:22></a>

		[G J Stewart] DEAREST BROTHER, You will have received much later news than I can send you how beloved Mr.<a name=2:1></a> Wigram is gone home, and since then the trouble they have had in London.<a name=2:2></a> But God makes this, as all else, work together for good to those who love Him.<a name=2:3></a> With the details I have had little or nothing to do, being absent in France; with the root and ground of it everything .<a name=2:4></a>.<a name=2:5></a>.<a name=2:6></a> .<a name=2:7></a> The result is in God's hands, so that I go no further.<a name=2:8></a> I have long felt the state of things; and that the Lord will sift the brethren, or is doing so, cannot be doubted.<a name=2:9></a> What struck me was, not the evil, I see as much in the apostles' days, but powerlessness to meet the evil.<a name=2:10></a> I was most thankful to get the news of brethren in Australia New Zealand, etc.<a name=2:11></a> God, I think, is working here in spite of all.<a name=2:12></a> There are conversions, and He is binding saints together where there was division and evil .<a name=2:13></a>.<a name=2:14></a>.<a name=2:15></a> .<a name=2:16></a> On the whole in England there is much to thank God for.<a name=2:17></a> We are not out of the place of patient waiting on the Lord, but the mass of evil which seemed insurmountable is wasting to its own real dimensions, and people's consciences, I trust, are awakening to God's presence, and realities, and when we are in God's presence all goes right.<a name=2:18></a> I have the Lord greatly with me in it all, though deeply tried.<a name=2:19></a> When people were tried with circumstances, I was comparatively at peace, had gone through it with the Lord.<a name=2:20></a>

		I think I see that Christ is presented in glory as one who leads us on in energy, conforming us to what He is according to the glory; and that when the question is of nourishing the inward life, and the affections and character, it is the humbled Christ on whom we have to feed.<a name=2:21></a> This is partly the case in Philippians 2 and 3: the former the inward state and character, Christ coming down; the latter, a glorified Christ, the Object after which we run.<a name=2:22></a> But it is taught in many passages.<a name=2:23></a> I have been struck also latterly, in connection with a controversy on certain teaching whose soundness was in question, that while Romans gives us death to sin, the old man or flesh, and Colossians death and resurrection, just touching Ephesian ground, this last has nothing to do with dying to the old man.<a name=2:24></a> The object of grace is owned as dead in sins, and then a wholly new creation in Christ; so that we have the contrast of the two things, what by the Holy Ghost we are put into, and what we were in the flesh.<a name=2:25></a> Colossians is life, not the Holy Ghost; estate, not place.<a name=2:26></a> But I must close.<a name=2:27></a> We have nearly done the bulk of our work.<a name=2:28></a>

		[Dr Walter] MY DEAR BROTHER, Thank you much for your kind note.<a name=3:1></a> I suffered more than is any good for me to talk about, more or less for these two years or more, but said nothing and did nothing, but bore, till I gave up everything to God; since then I have been as peaceful as possible, and free to enjoy the unspeakable goodness of God.<a name=3:2></a> The state of things forced me to act in this matter alone; and when -- gave expression by an overt act to what was going on, and I knew to be going on, for a long while, and he sent me word, I had a full correspondence with him, friendly, but telling him what I saw to be the working of his act; and it was not till all remonstrance and reasoning was useless that I ceased the correspondence, and told him so.<a name=3:3></a> Those who backed him up in evil are responsible for a great deal.<a name=3:4></a> I then felt I must act individually which I did, and only stated what I had sure and certain ground for, but that definitely and plainly.<a name=3:5></a> I have no particular pleasure in the word 'profane,' but my business was to make plain what his act was.<a name=3:6></a> He pretended to have a kind of private inspiration as to it, and long insisted on being led of the Holy Ghost.<a name=3:7></a> Now the thing was wrong, done secretly, knowing that all brethren would be against it: none defend it now.<a name=3:8></a> He had been thinking of it before, I know, though I paid no attention to it at the time.<a name=3:9></a> So little was there any leading of the Holy Ghost, that in three weeks he had broken with the person he was led to, and they were in utter opposition.<a name=3:10></a> The bringing in the Holy host for what was wrong in itself, and done in this way, and really to put down the meeting which was and is there, I felt and feel was a profane thing.<a name=3:11></a> The mischief which was at work seemed to blind to all the plainest features of what was right and wrong, honourable and dishonourable.<a name=3:12></a> This was what made it urgent to be plain.<a name=3:13></a> Having given my personal testimony I have never meddled in the discipline part, and indeed, being out here, could not in the practical part, and I had no advice to give.<a name=3:14></a> I cast it on the Lord, and He has wrought.<a name=3:15></a> Consciences are gradually awakening.<a name=3:16></a> I do not think that we have got into clear water, but there is much more sense of where we are and were.<a name=3:17></a> I am not much in correspondence with England as to what goes on there; till about a fortnight ago, I may say not at all.<a name=3:18></a> But as I believe God is working, I am quite at peace.<a name=3:19></a>

		[Mr Rule] DEAREST BROTHER, I was very glad to hear from you, and thank you for giving me the information, too, as to the brethren.<a name=6:17></a> My heart clings to them all as ever, though far away- and now far on in my seventy-ninth year, I cannot, humanly speaking, look to travelling to see them as I once did: though my mind is, through mercy, free as ever, my body naturally is not nearer home in one sense, nearer Christ I hope in every sense.<a name=6:18></a> I rejoice in the blessing, both at Sugar Creek and St.<a name=6:19></a> Louis not only for their sakes as I do, but in the Lord shewing Himself in grace.<a name=6:20></a> Both places have gone through a sifting, as is common after a first start, and now spring up again under His gracious hand.<a name=6:21></a> May it continue and be kept in humility the sure and only way of enjoying blessing.<a name=6:22></a> He always blesses, but we only enjoy it then.<a name=6:23></a> On His faithful love we can always reckon oh how surely!<a name=6:24></a> The Lord is working everywhere, but will have what is holy and true amongst His own.<a name=6:25></a> Everything seems to shew we are closing in to the end; at any rate, our part is to be ever waiting for Him, who has loved us and will make us like Himself.<a name=6:26></a> It is God's own rest we are called to enter into: what likeness to His thoughts and delights we must have to do so, and how blessed that is!<a name=6:27></a> but this is our portion.<a name=6:28></a>

		[From the French.<a name=9:1></a>] VERY DEAR BROTHER, Our passage down here is a time of wars and conflicts, and it could not be otherwise.<a name=9:2></a> Now, if the enemy finds us uncovered, if the flesh is active, he can ever harass us.<a name=9:3></a> More than this, we must have the whole armour of God to be able to meet him.<a name=9:4></a> It is not a question of strength but of wiles, and God allows us to make the discovery of our state by this means, as in the case of Ai, and of the Gibeonites.<a name=9:5></a> But in the work there will always be conflict victory, no doubt, if we are faithful.<a name=9:6></a> To stand, that is our business, in the evil days.<a name=9:7></a>

		I am sure, dear brother, that as to these evil speeches there is only one thing to be done to be silent, and bear them, and cast all on God, praying even for those who speak thus.<a name=9:8></a> I have been struck with the place that patience has in the christian life, in the New Testament: "Strengthened with all might according to the power of his glory" what great work is to follow?<a name=9:9></a> "unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness:" "Let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and complete in all the will of God.<a name=9:10></a>" Because then the will of man himself, his own spirit, has no place in our walk.<a name=9:11></a> Often, even in seeking to do good, we do not sufficiently expect God to act, who alone is able to do good.<a name=9:12></a> I hope the brethren who have been evil spoken of will have perfect patience, and God will judge their cause.<a name=9:13></a> Let them place themselves at the same time before God, humbled on account of all thus evil, praying God to bring in the remedy Himself.<a name=9:14></a> He will compel you, it may be, to exercise patience; He will exercise it Himself; and in His time (and it is the best) He will appear for the blessing and to the joy of those who have waited for Him.<a name=9:15></a> Salute the brethren.<a name=9:16></a><br>1879

		MY DEAR BROTHER, Propitiation is properly for sins, as Hebrews 2, and 1 John 2; and Romans 3: 25, 26 is to the same effect: only, Christ having taken the condemnation for sin, persons who do not search out words exactly may speak of the effect as for sin.<a name=10:28></a> Sin, as calling for it, was not properly known in the Old Testament.<a name=10:29></a> Leviticus 1 does not, as far as I see, apply to this, except in a very general way.<a name=10:30></a> It was as a peri; aJmartiva" that God "condemned sin in the flesh" in Christ for us, so that there was no condemnation for us.<a name=10:31></a> In Leviticus 1, though blood was shed and atonement made, all is sweet savour.<a name=10:32></a> Man's state is no doubt assumed, that is, sin; but the condemnation side is not what is in view, but acceptance.<a name=10:33></a> In the peri; aJmartiva" sin is properly in view: in propitiation sins are in view.<a name=10:34></a> Substitution is a human word, though a right one; but properly it is sins; that is, the scape-goat in contrast with the Lord's lot.<a name=10:35></a> Sin, as such, is never forgiven: God condemned sin in the flesh, but Christ took this place, was given peri; aJmartiva", and knowing no sin, the condemnation of sin in the flesh took place, and that in death, and we are dead with Him for faith: it has ceased to exist -- the condemnation of it gone.<a name=10:36></a> Death in Christ involves both.<a name=10:37></a> Guilt is from sins.<a name=10:38></a> We are dead to sin with Christ, but He has died for our sins.<a name=10:39></a> This last is what is properly atonement, and meets judgment.<a name=10:40></a> Death to sin is a question of state, not of guilt, though of exclusion from God.<a name=10:41></a> A question of defilement, not guilt, refers (and rightly) to what was done in the sanctuary, which was defiled (not guilty), which in full apprehension of the work has its importance.<a name=10:42></a> The scape-goat had to do with personal guilt; the blood on the mercy-seat with approach to God, but the sanctuary was cleansed.<a name=10:43></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The word "atonement" is very vague, and never used in the English New Testament but once, where it ought not to be.<a name=10:44></a> In the Old, $$$ rp'K; "to make atonement" refers to the removal of positive guilt out of God's sight.<a name=10:45></a> And, as I have said, sin properly does not come into question in the Old Testament, though birth in it is recognised in one place only.<a name=10:46></a> (Psalm 51: 5) Even where the sweet savour of Christ's acceptance is figured, man's sinful condition is recognised, and the work that is infinitely acceptable is in view of this.<a name=10:47></a> But this, though it assumes it, does not deal with sin in itself.<a name=10:48></a> Lost and guilt are different: one my state; the other, my responsibility and guilty failure.<a name=10:49></a> I believe I have said all I can at this moment.<a name=10:50></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I doubt whether you have got all the bearing of scripture as to sin.<a name=10:51></a> "Now once in the consummation of the ages hath he appeared eij" ajqe;thsin aJmartiva" by the sacrifice of himself.<a name=10:52></a>" It is not a question of guilt and imputation that is here.<a name=10:53></a> Judgment is according to works, but Christ was peri; aJmartiva" when God condemned sin in the flesh; further, as to sin of the world, we have ai[rwn th;n aJmartivan tou' kovsmou.<a name=10:54></a> (John 1: 29).<a name=10:55></a> We have had an innocent garden, then a sinful world, then a world wherein dwelleth righteousness.<a name=10:56></a> Of course there can be no sin in mere creation, but the status is one of sin, "the bondage of corruption": defilement can be, if not guilt; hence the tabernacle and all the vessels were sprinkled with blood True, because of Israel's sins, but defilement attached to them: "the heavens are not clean in his sight," and He who went into the lower parts of the earth, is gone "above all heavens that he might fill all things.<a name=10:57></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Sin in the flesh is not guilt; but it would defile, and not allow us to be with God, were it not condemned in the cross through His death who was made sin for us.<a name=10:58></a> The full effect will only be in the new heavens and new earth.<a name=10:59></a> Since not put away in the lost, I fully admit; but I could not say there was no suffering for sin in the abstract.<a name=10:60></a> It is never said sin is put away: I know the work is done, and am at rest.<a name=10:61></a> But the fact will not be accomplished as an effect till the new heavens and the new earth.<a name=10:62></a> If taking away be not a sacrificial expression, peri; aJmartiva" is, and the sacrifice of Himself is I could not say there is no sin of the world except as regards guilt and responsibility: it does not recognise defilement by sin.<a name=10:63></a> Further, $$$ rp'K; applied to the holy place (Leviticus 16, 16-20); so it is to the burnt-offering (Leviticus 1), where there was no actual sin committed.<a name=10:64></a> The main effect of the burnt-offering is to shew the perfect sweet savour of the sacrifice of Christ to God, but it was made in respect of sin, but not on account of actual sins committed.<a name=10:65></a> Man must come by blood because he is a sinner, and though we get Christ Himself here (not "of his own voluntary will," for that is a mistake, though it was so but for his acceptance" Leviticus 1: 3), yet, as it is for us, the element of sin must be brought in.<a name=10:66></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to speaking of atonement, which, although acknowledged he did not bring adequately into prominence, the reason for it is very simple, as you may see in reading Leviticus 1: 4, where it Is especially said to be so in the usual (we may say, technical) word.<a name=10:67></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Matthew 22: 14 seems clearly profession, or outward calling the chosen, those owned in the wedding.<a name=10:68></a> As to Matthew 20 you must connect it with 19.<a name=10:69></a> There devotedness and self sacrifice are made the ground of reward.<a name=10:70></a> Only the principles of law and grace are so different, that those great in one would be very little in the other.<a name=10:71></a> But lest there should be self and self-righteousness wrought by what preceded, the sovereign grace of chapter 20 is introduced, and the converse stated -- many last first, and first last.<a name=10:72></a> Here it is grace as to service, only so much work for so much pay is utterly blown upon.<a name=10:73></a> The rest trusted the master for what they might get, and free grace acts consequently.<a name=10:74></a> God alone can judge what He should do in rewarding.<a name=10:75></a> Thus last are first, and first last.<a name=10:76></a> Many are called to serve, some chosen vessels, but all in grace.<a name=10:77></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In a general way we have God's book as a registry.<a name=10:78></a> But then you have specifically in the New Testament, "book of life.<a name=10:79></a>" In one case it is said, "whose names are not written in the book of life of the slain Lamb, from the foundation of the world.<a name=10:80></a>" These God had written, and it was sure.<a name=10:81></a> But they are supposed true, unless shewn to be otherwise as one on the list of voters, unless proved to have no right.<a name=10:82></a>

		[To the same.<a name=14:24></a>] F Rowan, I do not think that any take eternal life for a new soul and I am afraid your attempt to define will only makes the matter more obscure.<a name=14:25></a> Existence is not life: the table exists but is not alive.<a name=14:26></a> "In him we live" is not we have life.<a name=14:27></a> But the thing I fear is the unsettling the fact of what life in Christ is.<a name=14:28></a> Thus "the Father hath life in Himself.<a name=14:29></a>" Is that a mere condition of being?<a name=14:30></a> Again, "that eternal life which was with the Father and has been manifested to us.<a name=14:31></a>" Your system loses, it seems to me, too much "He that sanctifieth, and they who are sanctified are all of one, for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren.<a name=14:32></a>" The life by which the Lord lived in this world was not in the first Adam at all, even when innocent.<a name=14:33></a> "Because I live," says Christ, "ye shall live also.<a name=14:34></a>" He is a life-giving Spirit.<a name=14:35></a> Remark, if the tree was not eternal life, it was the tree of life, not of existence, and living for ever, not existing for ever, which is spoken of.<a name=14:36></a> So that your attempt to distinguish by definition breaks down the first step.<a name=14:37></a> So again, "all live unto him" (Luke 20) breaks down your definition, for the aim of that is to say that though the condition of existence was changed, life was still there.<a name=14:38></a> So when you say it is not in us as yet, you touch a vital point: we have life; Christ is our life.<a name=14:39></a> "This life is in His Son," and "he that hath the Son hath life.<a name=14:40></a>" Do you mean that none of us have the Son?<a name=14:41></a> then the wrath of God abides on us.<a name=14:42></a> The ascribing to a person what is true only of a nature, runs through all John's epistle.<a name=14:43></a> "He cannot sin;" "the evil one toucheth him not.<a name=14:44></a>" It is not a community of being, because He is also God; but we are all ejx eJno;",<a href="#14:f3"><sup class="footnote-link">+++</sup></a> and because He lives we shall: He gives us eternal life, and we shall never perish.<a name=14:45></a> Our condition of being will change, our life not.<a name=14:46></a> Scripture adds the presence of the Holy Ghost for the christian condition of being.<a name=14:47></a> But "he that is joined to the Lord is one Spirit:" what is that so far but community of being?<a name=14:48></a> The life of Jesus is to be manifested in our mortal flesh, and this is said if we which live are delivered to death that it may be so.<a name=14:49></a> You make it only born of water, but "that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.<a name=14:50></a>" Your effort at defining breaks down, and I fear its taking away the reality of a new life in Christ; quite admitting it is distinct from immortality.<a name=14:51></a> I have it in Him as much when mortal as when immortal: that is a change in the condition of being; the life, Luke 20 teaches us, is not touched in that change.<a name=14:52></a>

		[To the same.<a name=16:1></a>] F Rowan, Metaphysics will never save souls.<a name=16:2></a> The real point is do we receive something new?<a name=16:3></a> I am not aware that scripture speaks of life in Christ.<a name=16:4></a> We have "the law of the Spirit of life in Christ.<a name=16:5></a>" But it is said, "Christ is our life.<a name=16:6></a>" I suppose that is something new for a sinner, or even for Adam innocent.<a name=16:7></a> The point in John 3: 6 is not born of the Spirit, but what is "born of the Spirit is Spirit.<a name=16:8></a>" I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.<a name=16:9></a>" I believe fully in the immortality of the soul, but that has nothing to do with eternal life That "was with the Father and was manifested unto us.<a name=16:10></a>" It is Christ the Son.<a name=16:11></a> And as to us, it is something in us which springs up as a well of water.<a name=16:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Your speaking of 'being' is unconsciously a sophism, because 'a being' in English means something having life.<a name=16:13></a> Life constitutes in ordinary English an existing thing, a being of which the manifestation is spontaneity.<a name=16:14></a> But this does not touch this question, but whether, the soul being supposed which gives personality, I do not receive something positive in receiving Christ that I had not before: "God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son;" "he that hath the Son hath life: Christ is life.<a name=16:15></a> It is never said we have life in ourselves, even when Christians, but in Christ.<a name=16:16></a> Of course, born of the Spirit is in contrast with born of the flesh, but born of the flesh is beginning to be, or to have life.<a name=16:17></a> Life is not a condition of being; it constitutes it: a material substance without life is not called a being.<a name=16:18></a> 'A being' supposes personal spontaneity; only life in scripture goes further than mere power of personal spontaneity: but life is not what affects the state of a being where personal spontaneity already is, but is the source of it: and this for the Christian is Christ, and not what we have from Adam In virtue of that I reckon myself dead to sin, the body is dead," I am not in the flesh.<a name=16:19></a> In your system it is merely a modification of the state of a living being.<a name=16:20></a> Now that is being born of water, hence the other is added, born of the Spirit.<a name=16:21></a> It is not said 'is water,' but it is said "is spirit.<a name=16:22></a>" Is life in God a mere condition of His being?<a name=16:23></a> 'Being' means what has life.<a name=16:24></a> Hence to say life is a condition of what has life has by itself no sense.<a name=16:25></a> "In himself" may characterise it in God, "in the Son" may characterise it in us not in ourselves.<a name=16:26></a> To this is added the presence of the Holy Ghost: "the Spirit is life because of righteousness.<a name=16:27></a>" He is as the perennial spring to the stream, so livingly united, that "because I live ye shall live also:" we are "created in Christ Jesus.<a name=16:28></a>" It does not change our personality, even when death affects the body, or present constituted organisation, and we live in our souls for God, though the organised vessel may be turned to dust, but, if Christ be our life, with Him.<a name=16:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to your reasoning, you contradict yourself in saying life is 'being' in a given condition, and yet that you cannot have being without a thing's having life already: death is a change in our condition of being, not in our circumstances of life.<a name=16:30></a> Having the Son as life so that we live by Him is not merely a circumstance of our life.<a name=16:31></a> Scripture never speaks so, but says Christ is our life so thoroughly so that because He lives we shall live.<a name=16:32></a> What is scripturally defective in your mind is the real reception of the Son as life, the source of a new spontaneity in the soul.<a name=16:33></a> And this is a very grave matter.<a name=16:34></a>

		Dear Mr Gordon, I could see, without your telling me so, that you have been made up in the teaching of those who deny the immortality of the soul, and make those whom scripture calls the offspring of God," a cleverer kind of brute.<a name=18:1></a> What you have quoted from my Geneva lectures I hold, as then, or still more, to be of all-importance.<a name=18:2></a> The coming of the Lord and the resurrection of the body was lost in the soul's going to heaven and that through the Platonists, and it was a sign of the ruin of the church.<a name=18:3></a> It made no such impression as you suppose on my hearers, for the immortality of the soul was not in question was accepted as a recognised truth by them as by myself.<a name=18:4></a> I may say the contrary had never been heard of there.<a name=18:5></a> The first person who used the passage left out what guarded it, and I feared that I had exposed myself to the charge carelessly, no one doubting it when the lectures were given but he had to confess he had it in his copy.<a name=18:6></a> I added in the next edition more, I think the quotations, but cannot now be quite sure; but that death was ceasing to exist, none of us dreamt of.<a name=18:7></a> Hence, too, there is nothing about eternal punishment; the point was that in the public teaching of the church, going to heaven had taken the place of the Lords coming and the resurrection.<a name=18:8></a> When I began to preach these, fifty years ago, I was held to be I know not what -- enthusiast or heretic -- and I am thankful to have been the means of spreading it far and wide.<a name=18:9></a> The whole purport and character of the church was and largely still is clouded by this departure from the truth.<a name=18:10></a> In America men of standing in the professing church deny the resurrection altogether as to men, not perhaps as to Christ -- though the apostle binds them together.<a name=18:11></a>

		You give an interpretation of Luke 20 instead of receiving what is said.<a name=18:12></a> The Lord first speaks of the saints only, those who "shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from among the dead," "children of God, being the children of the resurrection.<a name=18:13></a>" Then He says, even Moses shewed this at the bush: God is not "a God of the dead but of the living": and then lays the foundation of an absolute fact of which He had not spoken before at all: "<i>For all</i> live unto him.<a name=18:14></a>" They have died as regards men, but as to God, wicked or saints, all live: It is not confined to saints, but it is so with every one.<a name=18:15></a> Before He had been speaking of the resurrection of the saints, and exclusively of that resurrection; now He declares that <i>for God</i> all live.<a name=18:16></a> He denies that death is the cessation of existence, and in an absolute and positive way.<a name=18:17></a> Nor is it exact to say it is of the question of resurrection Go is speaking, in calling the things that are not as though they were.<a name=18:18></a> (Romans 4: 17) He is speaking of quickening Abraham's dead state so that he should be the father of many nations.<a name=18:19></a>

		There is not a word of the sense you put into [the parable of] Dives and Lazarus in the passage.<a name=18:20></a> They were both Jews: it is the substitution of the unseen world for this.<a name=18:21></a> Abraham's bosom is a wholly Jewish thought.<a name=18:22></a> Hades was well known to them, and is found in the Old Testament in the term <i>Sheol</i>.<a name=18:23></a> But it is expressly and explicitly making the unseen world seen in a parabolic description; they both alike died.<a name=18:24></a> There is no thought of the cross opening the door to the Gentiles, or breaking down the middle wall of partition.<a name=18:25></a> The Lord says they are to hear Moses and the prophets, or one rising from the dead would have no effect.<a name=18:26></a> It is a mere effort to get rid of the plain testimony, that the soul subsists after death in the case both of wicked and of just.<a name=18:27></a> All live for God.<a name=18:28></a> The soul is unaffected by death as to existence, save that it is separated from the body.<a name=18:29></a> What was the gulf fixed between Jews and Gentiles by the change of dispensation?<a name=18:30></a> What had "thou in thy lifetime" to do with dispensations?<a name=18:31></a> It did do this as to Jews and Christianity, that there was an end of riches being a sign of God's favour, but it was not because of a change of dispensation, but that the truth of things came out in another scene, not in this.<a name=18:32></a> The purpose is as plain as possible to those who have not been perverted by this false doctrine.<a name=18:33></a> Luke 15 shews the grace that seeks and receives the sinner; then (chapter 16) the use grace makes of this world's goods; and then the veil is drawn to contrast the effect in that with the portion of selfishness in this world -- "<i>thy</i> good things.<a name=18:34></a>" The rich man had a fine funeral, but there it ended for this world.<a name=18:35></a> It is expressly declared that death does not reach to the soul.<a name=18:36></a> Fear not them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do; but .<a name=18:37></a>.<a name=18:38></a>.<a name=18:39></a> him who after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell.<a name=18:40></a>" Mortal is always confined to the body.<a name=18:41></a>

		As regards the saints an intermediate state is taught as plainly as words can teach it: "To depart and to be with Christ which is far better': "Absent from the body and to be present with the Lord"; "To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise": the express object of which is to teach the blessedness of the intermediate state in contrast with Christ's coming in (not 'into') His kingdom.<a name=18:42></a> So Stephen, "Lord Jesus receive my spirit.<a name=18:43></a>" The passages I have quoted before shew it as to all; and Peter tells us that the Lord knows how "to reserve the unjust to the day of judgment to be punished.<a name=18:44></a>" Your reference to 1 Corinthians 15 is of no avail here, because it speaks of believers only in what you quote; they are "raised in glory.<a name=18:45></a>" Nor will any bringing of it to 2 Corinthians 5 help you as to the plain statement there as to the saints, which is as plain as plain can be.<a name=18:46></a> He was thinking of dying, as chapter 1 shews; he was not wishing it, as weary of the trials, but looking for an eternal weight of glory, and through them; but having spoken of this as God's purpose, he speaks of what is man's portion through sin -- death and judgment -- and yet, having eternal life and the Spirit, is "always confident," even in view of death.<a name=18:47></a> Knowing that if absent from the body, which most assuredly is not resurrection, but the contrary, he would be present with his Lord, that to depart and to be with Christ is far better.<a name=18:48></a> He does not quite dislike the idea of death in the first paragraph, but merely says his desire was to be clothed upon, not unclothed, and contrasts it with groaning in this tabernacle, yet not so that he wanted to be rid of it, but to be clothed upon; and in verse 9 formally puts the two cases.<a name=18:49></a> I do not agree with you as to identity by the Spirit; I am not the Holy Ghost, nor is the Holy Ghost me.<a name=18:50></a> As dwelling in me they are distinguished; He bears witness with my spirit.<a name=18:51></a> (Romans 8: 16.<a name=18:52></a>) After all your turning about this passage, it remains that when you quit home you are with the Lord, and you are not the Holy Ghost.<a name=18:53></a> It just shews where error and our own thoughts drive us.<a name=18:54></a> It is not even true that Christ's neighbour on the cross had the Spirit.<a name=18:55></a> You confound the life begotten by the Spirit, and the Spirit itself, which dwelling in us, makes our bodies a temple.<a name=18:56></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the question of eternal punishment, the question is always really of the sense we have of the deserts of our own sin, and is inseparable from that of the immortality of the soul; as if I have one and am at enmity with God, I must be for ever miserable as shut out into outer darkness.<a name=18:57></a> But you have confounded, as is very common, law and gospel.<a name=18:58></a> The Gentiles have no law: "As many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law, and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law.<a name=18:59></a>" So that all your system is wrong from beginning to end according to scripture.<a name=18:60></a> Further, it is never said Christ was substituted for all it is that he died for all.<a name=18:61></a>" You confound the blood on the mercy-seat and the scape-goat: the Lord's lot, and the bearing of the sins of the people represented by the high priest.<a name=18:62></a> You will find no Scripture which speaks of bearing the sins of all, but carefully the contrary.<a name=18:63></a> The passage you quote from Exodus gives the principles of the government of Israel in contrast with atonement, which Moses talked of, and could not make, each person being to be blotted out for his own sin; and besides that, though forgiving their sin governmentally, declares that when He visited He would visit their sin upon them.<a name=18:64></a> All this is a misapprehension of scripture.<a name=18:65></a> In quoting "the lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world," you have confounded sin and sins: one a state in which we are by Adam's sin, and the other our own guilt, and which are carefully distinguished at the end of Hebrews 1.<a name=18:66></a> The effect of this work will not be complete till the new heavens and the new earth.<a name=18:67></a> They are equally distinguished in Romans as to the believer and as to the remedy: one, Christ dying for our sins; the other, our having died with Christ: our guilt the consequence of our own sins -- our state the consequence of Adam's.<a name=18:68></a> You are all wrong as to making law the measure.<a name=18:69></a> It was the measure of human righteousness in a child of Adam.<a name=18:70></a> But what we have now is God's righteousness, and that without law.<a name=18:71></a> Nor is the blessing of Christianity though partially and darkly intimated (for of church blessings there is absolutely no hint, nor meant to be, but the contrary -- see Ephesians 3; Colossians 1), to be found in the Old Testament.<a name=18:72></a> Life and incorruptibility are brought to light by the gospel.<a name=18:73></a> Nor is the law the measure of human sin, though it is of human righteousness; it is the rejection of Christ, who came when the law had been broken, which is so.<a name=18:74></a> "Having yet one Son he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son" -- "but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.<a name=18:75></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		An immortal soul, hating God in grace, must be miserable.<a name=18:76></a> You say you consider that it is inconsistent with God's character to hide these terrible consequences of sin.<a name=18:77></a> You had better have looked at what is written (Genesis 3).<a name=18:78></a> He did then and there a great deal more than He had said.<a name=18:79></a> He told him of nothing but human sorrow and misery, and then death as a man on the earth: so in judging, he was to return to dust, and the woman to suffer in child-bearing.<a name=18:80></a> But He did a great deal more, giving in the judgment on Satan, what faith could rest on in hope.<a name=18:81></a> He drove out the man, and shut up the way of the tree of life -- exclusion from God and what He had established, and no immortality here below.<a name=18:82></a> So that in saying that, you are charging God foolishly, and forgetting that when "God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not imputing their trespasses" -- come in grace -- they rejected Him.<a name=18:83></a> Man under the gospel (in a general sense the world, for "there is no difference") is in a far worse state, though he may be redeemed out of it than when driven out of Paradise, and a final one if not born again and justified.<a name=18:84></a> I, as to the flesh, am at enmity with God.<a name=18:85></a> Further, if death be all the wages of sin (it is the wages assuredly, but it is falsely quoted as if it were ALL the wages of sin, and so you put it) then I pay the penalty for myself even as a Christian, and Christ need not have died for me, only given me a new life.<a name=18:86></a> Further, it is utterly false; for the whole consequences of our sins, save mere animal death (the penal arrest of man here) are after the judgment and the result of it.<a name=18:87></a> So that this whole view essential to your system is totally unscriptural and false.<a name=18:88></a> "It is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment.<a name=18:89></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do say the system subverts the atonement.<a name=18:90></a> The theory is that we are animals, and they quote what is said in Genesis to shew that <i>ruach</i> (breath), and <i>nephesh</i> (soul), and <i>ruach-chayim</i> (breath of life), etc.<a name=18:91></a>, were in animals.<a name=18:92></a> I admit it fully, man dies as an animal dies on the earth.<a name=18:93></a> God, they tell us, gives eternal life in Christ, but till then we have no immortal soul, but are simply a cleverer, more intellectual animal of superior intelligence.<a name=18:94></a> Now suppose God gives eternal life to an elephant or a dog, would a dog be responsible for what he had done before when he was a dog; would he have to repent?<a name=18:95></a> If not, neither have I.<a name=18:96></a> And what is the atonement for?<a name=18:97></a> A mere animal, for that is their theory, is not a responsible being -- is not in this, in relationship with God -- has never been tested as such -- is not at enmity with God as man is in the flesh, so that he cannot please God: there is no law for him of which you say so much.<a name=18:98></a> The system falsifies man's whole relationship with God, on which all rests as to him from creation on.<a name=18:99></a> It is as degrading as it is false.<a name=18:100></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will say, What scripture have you for saying animals are such?<a name=18:101></a> There are plenty, and the man who denies the difference debases himself to them; but suffice it to quote 2 Peter 2: 12.<a name=18:102></a> But even Genesis 1 is enough: God had formed the whole creation, and having made it complete as such, God saw that it was good; so closes the history of the creation of animals, of whom God had said, "Let the earth bring forth," and it brought forth.<a name=18:103></a> Then God solemnly consults about setting a head over it, the image of Him that was to come; then forms his body first, and breathes into his nostrils the breath of life -- making him in His own image and likeness.<a name=18:104></a> Thus He placed him in living relationship with Himself.<a name=18:105></a> He was His offspring in his created state, responsible, and his responsibility formally tested.<a name=18:106></a> Is this mere animal life?<a name=18:107></a> If it be as degrading as it is false, it is as false as it is degrading.<a name=18:108></a> No one denies man is an animal, a living soul; if you take his blood you take his life as you would a pig's.<a name=18:109></a> The question lies beyond that.<a name=18:110></a> We are not to fear them that kill the body but have no more that they can do.<a name=18:111></a> Animals do not want atonement, and I do: if I were only an animal, I do not.<a name=18:112></a> It makes animals responsible to God, and not mere "natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed," as scripture does; or man not so, if he is only an animal: and with responsibility, repentance and atonement disappear.<a name=18:113></a> I have confined myself to your statements.<a name=18:114></a> I add scripture speaks of everlasting punishment.<a name=18:115></a> They use eternal life to prove we have nothing eternal till we have Christ, and then when eternal is applied to punishment, say it does not mean it.<a name=18:116></a> The simple answer to shew its normal meaning in the New Testament is, "the things which are seen are temporal the things that are not seen are eternal.<a name=18:117></a>" But the real question is, What does my sin deserve?<a name=18:118></a> The answer to this is the test of where a man is, and settles by divine teaching what scripture declares as to life and punishment.<a name=18:119></a>

		[Dr C Wolston] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I bless God more than I can tell you for His gracious working.<a name=24:1></a> His way is "in the sanctuary" if His way is "in the sea," and if we are with Him there, the sea bows to His power; but to none else that I know of.<a name=24:2></a> After my first deep distress, I trusted His love, though sometimes depressed; and He has worked constantly and wonderfully.<a name=24:3></a> I have been surprised all has subsided so soon, but when He works all is soon still .<a name=24:4></a>.<a name=24:5></a>.<a name=24:6></a> .<a name=24:7></a>

		Dear C McAdam, -- .<a name=25:1></a>.<a name=25:2></a>.<a name=25:3></a> What I am anxious about, now that the Lord has delivered us from this very serious assault of the enemy, and in wonderful grace preserved His testimony amongst us, is a greater though less ostensible work; that the brethren should be devoted, faithful, unworldly (and that in all their ways) and spiritual, Christ being all.<a name=25:4></a> It has been a much more serious question and struggle than many brethren suppose, and God in sovereign goodness has preserved us, and, however feeble and unfaithful we may have been, His testimony amongst us.<a name=25:5></a> If the brethren do not lay it to heart, both the humiliation and the goodness, as largely shewn to encourage, God will take away the testimony from us, and who shall deliver us then.<a name=25:6></a> This is what occupies me now.<a name=25:7></a> I look to Him to do it, He only can, for who can make spiritual but He who works by His Spirit?<a name=25:8></a> Let brethren know they are nothing, and know no motive for anything but Christ, and all will be well.<a name=25:9></a> There is a testimony for the last days, and God will maintain it, but the brethren have been, through grace, the vessels of it.<a name=25:10></a> They rose in thoughts of themselves as they declined in consistency with the testimony.<a name=25:11></a> When God is at work, it is love for the truth, grief at the condition of the church of God, and separation of heart and ways to the truth, while waiting for Christ -- not thinking of ourselves as vessels of it.<a name=25:12></a> It is said of Jehovah Himself, that He was grieved at the misery of Israel.<a name=25:13></a> God allowed an assault of the enemy to shew us where we were -- nothing more humbling.<a name=25:14></a> In mercy He has delivered us: are we going to learn the lesson He teaches, and to go on with thankful hearts in the path of single-eyed devotedness, to meet the Lord.<a name=25:15></a> That is the question now.<a name=25:16></a> I have long said, brethren began by practical separation from the world.<a name=25:17></a> Though certain great truths for the last days were there, still what the world saw was that they were not of it.<a name=25:18></a> Is there going to be this testimony now.<a name=25:19></a> It was so in houses, ways, conduct -- many faults, I doubt not, but there was that stamped upon and characteristic of them.<a name=25:20></a> It was not a discussion whether they were Philadelphia or not.<a name=25:21></a> But I stop: you will understand what I mean .<a name=25:22></a>.<a name=25:23></a>.<a name=25:24></a> .<a name=25:25></a> But God is good, and has been most good to us and I trust to Him to arouse the sleeping brethren.<a name=25:26></a> Many I know have had their consciences awakened: may their hearts follow with faith in God's goodness.<a name=25:27></a> We read, "My soul followeth hard after thee; thy right hand upholdeth me.<a name=25:28></a>"

		[J G Deck] MY BELOVED BROTHER, -- I have waited to reply to your letter till our London troubles could at least be seen through.<a name=27:1></a> You will have sorrow at any rate, but God has been most gracious to us.<a name=27:2></a> It was a question of the existence of brethren.<a name=27:3></a> Satan made a violent effort to destroy their testimony.<a name=27:4></a> I had long felt it was in the air, and it pressed on me to return to England, though till I was back there was nothing precise in my mind.<a name=27:5></a> Dear Wigram, three years ago, said (not to me) that it was all over: he did to me in his last illness.<a name=27:6></a> But I felt the Lord was above it, and above everything, and so He has been.<a name=27:7></a> I suspect it helped to keep him out of England, and I believe hastened his end, though he had long been ailing.<a name=27:8></a> But Satan's effort has been confounded.<a name=27:9></a> There are details to be brought into order outside London, where, as it seems to me, they acted too hastily, though right at heart.<a name=27:10></a> But in London there is common action, and peace, and, save the places I have alluded to, clear conviction all over the country .<a name=27:11></a>.<a name=27:12></a>.<a name=27:13></a> .<a name=27:14></a> I was in France nearly all the time -- at first suffered intensely, but was enabled to commit it to the Lord, and pray.<a name=27:15></a> And though I put my finger on the public act, now judged, I took no other part, unless a soothing one to individuals, and on my return to England went to no meetings about it (but continued to pray the Lord) till the very last.<a name=27:16></a> But the Lord's hand was there, and I trust many consciences awakened all over the country; and this is what I have rejoiced in, for brethren had declined, the world crept in, and it was the fullest truth, with generally practice little better than their neighbours.<a name=27:17></a> I had, before it broke out, anxiously thought about leaving the public body of brethren, but felt it would not be faith.<a name=27:18></a>

		[Dr Neatby] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- As you speak of humiliation, I desire to reply a word.<a name=30:1></a> I think humiliation quite the thing called for, for the general state of brethren -- their worldliness, their decay in positive testimony, their low spiritual state generally.<a name=30:2></a> I thought I had spoken to you of Bochim when I wrote before, but I did not, though I did to another, at the same time.<a name=30:3></a> I accepted the general idea of Bochim, but not the special character.<a name=30:4></a> Bochim was instead of Gilgal, the place of circumcision, where the angel of the Lord (unknown to them) was.<a name=30:5></a> That was a judicial giving up of Gilgal.<a name=30:6></a> I do not as yet accept that for brethren: God might give us up, and we must bow but as yet I trust that He does not.<a name=30:7></a>
	</div>

		The difficulty as to common humiliation was, that what some judged as sin, others advocated and defended, or at least judged very light of.<a name=30:8></a> How could there be honest common humiliation?<a name=30:9></a> What defended the evil was exactly what the humiliation had to be for.<a name=30:10></a> The mere state of brethren was caring for brethrenism, not for God's glory.<a name=30:11></a> I do not say there was nothing of this last feeling, but, in general, it was shame for the state, not going to the root.<a name=30:12></a> However, <i>God</i> has judged the overt act, and, I suppose I may say, has cleared brethren from the principle that was at work so far .<a name=30:13></a>.<a name=30:14></a>.<a name=30:15></a> but godly souls are fully convinced that the demoralisation I spoke of has been manifested.<a name=30:16></a> The question of the existence of brethren as a testimony depends upon their recovery from this.<a name=30:17></a> If they do not, they will be at Bochim; but there, Gilgal and blessing were over.<a name=30:18></a> I trust the Lord will maintain His testimony.<a name=30:19></a> I think the question a most solemn one.<a name=30:20></a>

		-- takes the ground of Hebrews 12: 27, that brethren are to be removed as things that can be shaken, he and a few more being taken up afresh as a fresh testimony before the Lord comes.<a name=30:21></a> Now this being done as I affirm it to have been done, is an immensely vital point.<a name=30:22></a> If it has that character, it is not of God.<a name=30:23></a> It is no personal question.<a name=30:24></a> It is a question if, as he affirms, brethren are to be set aside or to remain a testimony for God.<a name=30:25></a> He has acted, as privately led of God, to set them aside.<a name=30:26></a> Half the brethren, I dare say much more, do not know what is involved.<a name=30:27></a> But God has wrought to judge the overt act.<a name=30:28></a> It now remains to see if brethren answer to His mercy, in drawing closer to Him .<a name=30:29></a>.<a name=30:30></a>.<a name=30:31></a> .<a name=30:32></a>

		Dear Mrs.<a name=31:1></a> Bevan, -- They confound the whole of the truth in Ephesians.<a name=31:2></a> It is the act of God who took Christ, and set Him at His right hand, and us by the same power, setting us in Him, making us sit together in heavenly places in Him.<a name=31:3></a> Canaan under Joshua is warfare, and in this sense experience -- warfare carried on by us in grace, as led by Christ in Spirit: and confounding these two things is one of the great mischiefs.<a name=31:4></a> But the use of the rest of the images is also false.<a name=31:5></a> The Red Sea is, I doubt not, an image of Christ's death and resurrection for us: but it is so as bringing us completely to God, not experience at all, but redemption, dying, and rising again: the wilderness and Canaan are experience.<a name=31:6></a> Thus "Thou hast led forth the people whom thou hast redeemed.<a name=31:7></a> Thou hast guided them by thy strength to thy holy habitation.<a name=31:8></a>" They were not in Canaan as an inheritance, but "Ye have seen .<a name=31:9></a>.<a name=31:10></a>.<a name=31:11></a> how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto <i>myself</i>.<a name=31:12></a>" It is God's work bringing them to Himself, complete -- not experimental, as of journeying or conflict experiences.<a name=31:13></a> It is all wrong confounding these.<a name=31:14></a> Even to Sinai, where originally they were to worship, all is simple grace.<a name=31:15></a> There they enter on the process of experimental knowledge of themselves.<a name=31:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The wilderness is no necessary thing nor part of God's purpose, nor mentioned when coming out of Egypt (Exodus 3, 6, and 15.<a name=31:17></a>) The thief on the cross never went through any wilderness, nor any Joshua (Canaan): redemption put him straight into Paradise.<a name=31:18></a> The "Ifs" of scripture are all connected with the journey and conflict, and met by the sure promise of God, because we and (so to speak) God, for faith, are both tested there.<a name=31:19></a> I admit fully there is a deliverance by dying with Christ to sin, in Romans, and to the world, in Colossians.<a name=31:20></a> But the wilderness, and Canaan as in Joshua, are not sitting in heavenly places, but man tested in his journey in this world, and conflict in heavenly places with spiritual wickedness.<a name=31:21></a> Now, for this last we have to be dead with Christ.<a name=31:22></a> Hence, Joshua is "every place that the sole of your feet shall tread upon;" it is active taking possession as the Lord's host, not sitting in heavenly places: in Ephesians we wrestle against spiritual wickedness in heavenly places, but having done all to stand.<a name=31:23></a> It is confounding the responsible man with the redeemed man.<a name=31:24></a> Redemption is always absolute and perfect: the responsible man, whether past Jordan or not, tested.<a name=31:25></a> I may war as in the flesh and be captive to sin, and set free and in the Spirit obtain the victory or stand fast.<a name=31:26></a> As to culpability and redemption, Egypt is the flesh even when started on the road.<a name=31:27></a> The wilderness is a usual but not necessary part of God's ways -- what the world becomes to those who are redeemed, or stand on that ground, and individually tested if they get to the end, viewed not as in heavenly places, but through redemption on a journey there; for scripture does so consider us: so in Philippians, so in Hebrews, though otherwise very different.<a name=31:28></a> Joshua -- Canaan -- is another thing; being God's host, we are realising what belongs to those who are risen with Christ.<a name=31:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I may look at redemption as complete in Christ, and then in Christ I am brought to God: I may look at it as the beginning of exercise for myself, tribulation working experience, and find a Joshua and Caleb place through God's faithfulness; or I may be fighting God's battles as the Lord's host; but neither are sitting in heavenly places.<a name=31:30></a> I may have eaten the grapes of Eshcol in the wilderness, and fail before Ai in Canaan: but redemption is perfect, and sitting in heavenly places in Christ -- one the absolute power, the other the blessed effect, of God's work.<a name=31:31></a> I have no going to Gilgal, constantly there, to renew the moral condition before God which even victory endangers.<a name=31:32></a>

		[To the same.<a name=33:1></a>] Mrs Bevan, I agree that we are sitting in heavenly places, <i>in</i> not <i>with</i> Christ; but I do not know in speaking of its being by faith, by which of course it is known, if you have allowed quite enough for union with Christ by the Holy Ghost.<a name=33:2></a> Again there are things which we enjoy by experience which are not acquired by experience: every sealed believer is in Christ before God, and his place is to know it (John 14); but there are those who do not, through imperfect teaching.<a name=33:3></a> Hence, to the Corinthians he writes as to carnal (not natural) not as to spiritual.<a name=33:4></a> "We speak wisdom among them that are perfect" -- perfect meaning simply grown men in Christ.<a name=33:5></a> So Philippians: "Let us therefore as many as be perfect.<a name=33:6></a>" We take the place by faith (beyond Jordan), but when taken we realise being in it by the Holy Ghost; and this is experience.<a name=33:7></a> It is not based on experience or progress in it.<a name=33:8></a> We are in it if in Christ.<a name=33:9></a> I reckon myself dead.<a name=33:10></a> But the wilderness is as much the fruit of redemption as Canaan.<a name=33:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is quite false to make it a matter of progressive experience, as at the end of the desert: it is our identification with Christ's death, and Jordan is identical in fact, though not in application, with the Red Sea.<a name=33:12></a> But at the Red Sea it is a redemption wrought for me: in Jordan I died -- not by experience, but I died; that is, it connects itself with our state, though we do not change that state by experience.<a name=33:13></a> But I experience that I have changed my <i>position</i>.<a name=33:14></a> This is not a play on words.<a name=33:15></a> A process of experience is not the operative cause; but I have been brought into a new experience which is the fruit of the change.<a name=33:16></a> It is important to see that it is no subject of progressive experience.<a name=33:17></a> Experience is that I cannot get it at all (Romans 7) -- no good to be got in me, nor a new position out of me, by any process.<a name=33:18></a> I then learn by simple faith, as taught of God, that He has condemned sin in the flesh, which I find in me, in the cross of Christ.<a name=33:19></a> (Romans 8: 3) This is simple faith and divine teaching; the effect is I am free according to verse 2, and take the ground of chapter 6.<a name=33:20></a> Ephesians 2 is quite another thing; there is no experience at all, but a new creation, if there, dead in sin.<a name=33:21></a> The new creation has nothing to do with dying, but we are viewed as dead in sin.<a name=33:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not know if you have seen what I have taught, that the wilderness is no part of the counsels of God but of His ways; and that the Red Sea and Jordan coalesce, only at Jordan they go up into the land.<a name=33:23></a> Further, in its full character the Red Sea closes all: they are brought to God, to His holy habitation, but not to the result of His plans as to us.<a name=33:24></a> The thief had no wilderness.<a name=33:25></a> All that experience learns is that I must have a deliverer; and then I learn that it is all done on the cross.<a name=33:26></a> The realisation of this (2.<a name=33:27></a> Corinthians 4) by the Holy Ghost is another thing; but then it is reckoning myself <i>dead</i> -- always carrying about the <i>dying</i>.<a name=33:28></a> It is important to see that Ephesians is on a totally different footing: and when on the ground of reckoning ourselves dead, there is an always carrying about the dying.<a name=33:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to relationships, it is all nonsense: I may be called out, as Christ Himself was but, save that calling, He was subject to, and afterwards lovingly owned, His mother.<a name=33:30></a> If a person is not called out, or giving up all for Christ, there is no question that these relationships are clear duties, and so treated everywhere in the New Testament.<a name=33:31></a> If they come into competition with Christ, everything gives way to Him.<a name=33:32></a>

		[To the same.<a name=35:1></a>] Mrs Bevan, As regards your estimate of my thoughts on our <i>reckoning</i> ourselves dead -- it requires a practical consciousness that we have no force to arrive at it; and there it is so many fail, often mistaking the joy of forgiveness for true deliverance.<a name=35:2></a> In Germany there has been much of this, and indeed a good deal everywhere.<a name=35:3></a> Practically there must be a single eye upward, or we do not discover our want of force.<a name=35:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As to disowning such relationships it requires the word.<a name=35:5></a> It may come to a question between Christ and these ties, and then everything must give way.<a name=35:6></a> We belong to the other world as risen with Christ, not to this; but as belonging to it, the acknowledgment of what God has established is part of our christian life.<a name=35:7></a> Is a wife to disown her husband, or children their parents?<a name=35:8></a> There is at bottom a great deal of self-licence in all this.<a name=35:9></a> It is monstrous.<a name=35:10></a> Where that is disowned which God has established, self, not Christ, has the first place in people's hearts.<a name=35:11></a> If the unbeliever disowns it it is another thing.<a name=35:12></a> If he breaks the tie, there is liberty; or if he requires what is contrary to Christ, for he receives his authority from Him, and cannot use it against the direct authority of Christ.<a name=35:13></a> We cannot feel too strongly that we belong to another world, not to this; but that is not the question, but the path of those who do belong to it according to the word.<a name=35:14></a>

		I have written because the idea of not owning the relationships is monstrous.<a name=35:15></a> You will find it a difficult task, because I greatly dread any diminution of the feeling that we are dead and risen with Christ, or of having our conversation in heaven.<a name=35:16></a> But so false a use of this, which I feel more strongly every day, is just what would tend to alarm upright souls as to the truth.<a name=35:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a loosing from the power of our surroundings (as the Americans say), and sometimes from the surroundings themselves, as called away by the Lord, or as driven out by themselves.<a name=35:21></a> The absence of natural affections is an evil sign of the last days; but we have to live in natural ties as those who are not in them, to act from Christ in them.<a name=35:22></a> What God established of natural relationships He always owns, carefully so; but a power has come in, which, as sin has ruined all, overrules or makes independent of them.<a name=35:23></a>

		With unconverted children it is another thing, they have for themselves no such object: then health has to be considered in cheerful exercise, occupation of mind without overstraining, and so on.<a name=36:10></a> But where there is wise interest of parents in them, they can, while providing for this, lead children to find their enjoyment with themselves, in kindly care of the poor, and a thousand healthful enjoyments and occupations; and this I have seen done, and children grow up attached to home and family.<a name=36:11></a> And this scripture contemplates.<a name=36:12></a> For schools I can only speak of general principles.<a name=36:13></a> As a rule music is a very dangerous occupation: it cultivates sentiment without conscience: as a general character musicians are not a moral body.<a name=36:14></a> It may have to be taught or learned where worldly parents require it.<a name=36:15></a>

		[J S Oliphant] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I am not unaware that a considerable party seek to keep up excitement.<a name=38:1></a> I do not think with quiet staid souls they do much except expose themselves: quiet service to Christ is what tells in the long run; it is all I think of doing.<a name=38:2></a> But God has acted.<a name=38:3></a> I do not expect to be clear of the incubus all at once.<a name=38:4></a> Had we more faith, we might see yet greater deliverance.<a name=38:5></a> I accept with thankfulness what God has done.<a name=38:6></a> A great deal of the talk that meets my ear has no effect upon me at all, at the utmost, tries me at the moment.<a name=38:7></a> What you are now feeling, when broken up as a system, weighed on my spirit, in all its collective force, beforehand.<a name=38:8></a> I do not see that haste has ever done any good in all this matter.<a name=38:9></a> I wait still on God: on what else should I?<a name=38:10></a> But I go on with my positive work with the best faith I have, and it is but poor; but feel the Spirit more than ever with me.<a name=38:11></a>

		[G J Stewart] MY BELOVED BROTHER, -- I was very glad to hear from you, as I always am, and of the beloved brethren too.<a name=39:31></a> It is a comfort to think that God, in sovereign grace, will have His beloved redeemed perfected and in peace with Him.<a name=39:32></a> Our part here is faithfulness in walk, under His care and by His will on the way.<a name=39:33></a> You will desire to know something of England .<a name=39:34></a>.<a name=39:35></a>.<a name=39:36></a> .<a name=39:37></a> All is not yet clear, but when God works we look for full result.<a name=39:38></a> And through it all I never was so happy within, and scripture and what is unseen more real and blessed than ever.<a name=39:39></a> I trust Australia will go on quietly and earnestly seeking the Lord and the good of souls for His glory.<a name=39:40></a> It is what I seek in England, to drop all this, and seek to minister Christ.<a name=39:41></a> It is what souls want, both for quietness, and forming them in His image.<a name=39:42></a> It is those who are not with Him who are restless.<a name=39:43></a>

		I have heard that brethren out in your world have been exercised about dear -- 's teaching, that souls are not Christ's till they are sealed.<a name=39:44></a> Now I agree with him, the authority for it being Romans 8: 9.<a name=39:45></a> The prodigal son shews what the force of it is; as converted and in the right road, he at best hoped to be treated as a mercenary, had not on the best robe which fitted him to go into the house, nor knew in any way his place as son.<a name=39:46></a> But we have to be guarded as to dealing with souls as to this, because they may cry, "Abba, Father" really, yet be kept down by the teaching they are under; and we must not quite confound the "perfect" -- that is, those who know their new place in Christ -- and one who being forgiven, and being sealed can cry, "Abba, Father," but does not yet know what he is brought into: he may be, like the Corinthians, carnal though a Christian.<a name=39:47></a> But I am very glad the question is before brethren.<a name=39:48></a> The fact of the Spirit being given besides a man being born again by the Spirit, has been so lost sight of, that a Christian's place has been lost sight of with it.<a name=39:49></a> And God blesses this truth of the Spirit's presence now; He would have it before the saints.<a name=39:50></a> But the knowledge of the liberty wherewith Christ has made us free, is different from that into which He has brought us so as to say, "As he is so are we in this world.<a name=39:51></a>" The latter is more John's doctrine than Paul's (Paul's more the liberty), though you may get the groundwork of it in Paul.<a name=39:52></a>

		Let me say a word as to Bochim.<a name=41:24></a> Looked at merely as used for humiliation or sorrow where saints have failed, and voluntarily by grace place themselves to own it before God, I heartily enter into it, but taken as it is really in scripture, there was nothing of the kind at Bochim.<a name=41:25></a> The Lord declared in judgment that He would no longer drive out their enemies, and they wept when they heard the judgment.<a name=41:26></a> There was no sorrow for sin and failure, but for judgment, and they worshipped where they wept.<a name=41:27></a> Gilgal, that is circumcision, the removal of the reproach of Egypt, and the Lord's presence by His angel in it, was lost for ever.<a name=41:28></a> There was no voluntary confession and humiliation at all.<a name=41:29></a> It is all a mistake.<a name=41:30></a> They had not faithfully put out the evil that was amongst them, and the Lord, though interfering from time to time in compassion, left them judicially in this state.<a name=41:31></a> I refer to this because the word became a kind of watchword with many.<a name=41:32></a> But God has wrought a great deliverance for us, much greater than most of those spared are aware of: some have felt it.<a name=41:33></a> And what I desire now is, that our consciences may turn and see where we had so- failed as to bring this sorrow upon us.<a name=41:34></a> I am not going to turn back and charge any one or refer to any recent circumstances, but to weigh, where conscience is awake, how we brought ourselves into the strait place we were in.<a name=41:35></a> I hesitated a moment whether I should say anything, before the details which remain were set in order by God, as I am assured His grace will do; but they do not affect my object.<a name=41:36></a>

		[G Biava] [From the Italian.<a name=45:1></a>] DEAR BROTHER, -- Your letter has long lain under my eyes waiting to be answered, but all September I was occupied in visiting the assemblies in Haute Loire, etc.<a name=45:2></a>, so that I was not able to write much.<a name=45:3></a> Here it is difficult to do all that I have on hand .<a name=45:4></a>.<a name=45:5></a>.<a name=45:6></a> .<a name=45:7></a> It is very sweet to have confidence in Him.<a name=45:8></a> You need, dear brother, to have the same confidence with respect to Italy.<a name=45:9></a> God has wrought there; the work is a work of patience, but when I think of the state of things at Milan the first time I went there, the difference is great.<a name=45:10></a> The work is a difficult one: people educated by priests always remain for long years under this influence; I have known it in Ireland, but God's grace is sufficient; it suffices for everything.<a name=45:11></a> And then God has raised up labourers.<a name=45:12></a> You have cause to bless God for what He has done already; progress that was too rapid would not be so solid .<a name=45:13></a>.<a name=45:14></a>.<a name=45:15></a> .<a name=45:16></a> Be sure the work in Italy is of interest to brethren; but we must look to God that He may work.<a name=45:17></a> I feel increasingly, what we all know, that the work for God is the work of God.<a name=45:18></a>

		W Reid, I hold most distinctly that the assembly must judge: "Put away from among yourselves that wicked person.<a name=46:1></a>" There are <i>three</i> concerned in the judgment: Christ's glory, the purity of the assembly, and the guilty individual.<a name=46:2></a> The second makes it necessary they should act, or they are involved in the evil.<a name=46:3></a> "Ye have," says the apostle, "approved yourselves to be clear in this matter.<a name=46:4></a>" This connects itself directly with Christ's glory.<a name=46:5></a> But nothing is done as to the assembly, if it has not acted.<a name=46:6></a> I have always objected to brethren going down to settle things for an assembly.<a name=46:7></a> A wise and godly brother may counsel from scripture and seek to arouse the conscience; but nothing is really done if the conscience of the assembly does not act.<a name=46:8></a> The word of scripture is, "Having in readiness to avenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.<a name=46:9></a>" The power of God's Spirit was to bring all that was under its influence to obedience to the ways of God.<a name=46:10></a> Then came vengeance on disobedience.<a name=46:11></a> You may not have an apostolic rod, but you have God's sure government for Christ's glory.<a name=46:12></a> Thus, supposing evident sin, as at Corinth, and one supported him in it and refused the clear common consent of all, so that it was a rejection of the assembly's authority when the case and the word were clear, they might hold him guilty with the offender.<a name=46:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But if there were godly brethren who doubted about the facts, or the judgment of scripture on the facts -- provided the rightness of discipline in itself be recognised, so that it is not the principle of retaining known evil, or the denial of the competency of the assembly to judge evil -- then I should say they should wait and look to the Lord to make them of one mind.<a name=46:14></a> Speaking of a 'dead-lock'<a href="#46:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> is supposing only men are there, whereas Christ is.<a name=46:15></a> If the assembly be in a state incompetent to judge, it is for the assembly to humble itself, that through grace it may be able to know God's mind.<a name=46:16></a> There is One above it all able to bring about His thoughts, and he who has faith will find the sureness of His hand if He be really waited on.<a name=46:17></a> But nothing requires more waiting on Him than discipline, personal feelings are so apt to come in.<a name=46:18></a>

		[Mr Finch] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I do not think you see the bearing of -- 's act.<a name=48:1></a> It was not that he broke bread with you or any other isolated Christian.<a name=48:2></a> That, and I said so and was reproached with it, might pass.<a name=48:3></a> One might desire confidence and fellowship in such actings, but if done in the unity of the Spirit there was no wrong in it.<a name=48:4></a> But at Ryde there was a meeting, owned right or wrong by the other gatherings in the island and elsewhere and he went down, while saying in London that it was only to follow what he considered a movement of God, declaring to others that he went also to give a testimony against the gathering that was there -- in fact, setting up something apart from it.<a name=48:5></a> This entirely altered the character of the act.<a name=48:6></a> 'As to the unity of the body, I feel no difficulty as to scripture or the position of brethren.<a name=48:7></a> As to the danger of slipping into sectarianism, that is, making ourselves a body apart, I recognise it fully; but it has through mercy received a rude shock.<a name=48:8></a> The printed list of meetings tended to it, for evil slips in unintentionally, and for this reason I never would have anything to say to it, though very convenient, and done with this view.<a name=48:9></a> M.<a name=48:10></a>'s book,<a href="#48:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> which I never heard of till three days ago, strange to say, had from what I hear of it (I have never seen it) the same tendency; but human nature is always disposed to say 'we' if it cannot say 'I': "He followeth not with us": while in separation from the camp, I am as decided as possible.<a name=48:11></a> But I never in my life asked any one to come among brethren.<a name=48:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the principle of scripture is as plain as possible.<a name=48:13></a> There was one body <i>on earth</i>, of which all are members.<a name=48:14></a> They do not heal in heaven, nor preach, nor use any of the gifts spoken of in 1 Corinthians 12.<a name=48:15></a> "If one member suffer, all the members suffer with it:" that is not in heaven.<a name=48:16></a> The body will be perfected in heaven (Ephesians 1: 23), but is practically always considered as on earth, and formed there: "by one Spirit are we all baptised into one body.<a name=48:17></a>" And this was clearly down here.<a name=48:18></a> (Acts 2) The Lord's supper is the external sign of this unity: "one body for we are all partakers of that one loaf.<a name=48:19></a>" It was this, more than fifty years ago, brought me out of the establishment: nor have I any other principle now.<a name=48:20></a> This obliged me to own every one baptised with the Holy Ghost as a member of the body.<a name=48:21></a> Only in the last days we are called on to distinguish those who "call on the name of the Lord <i>out of a pure heart</i>," which at the first was not called for: "<i>the Lord</i> added daily.<a name=48:22></a>" This makes the brethren (so-called) not the church of God, but those who alone meet on the principle of its unity.<a name=48:23></a> The line between narrowness and fidelity is a very narrow one.<a name=48:24></a> But the Spirit of Christ can guide and keep us on it.<a name=48:25></a> The unity of the body cannot be touched, for the Holy Ghost unites to Christ: all those who have been baptised by the Holy Ghost (that is, received Him) are members of the body.<a name=48:26></a> It is "the unity of the Spirit" we have to keep; that is, to walk in that power of the Spirit which keeps us in unity on the earth, and that needs endeavouring.<a name=48:27></a> I dread a gathering in any place being called the church of God.<a name=48:28></a> They are the only assembly that meets on scriptural principles did I not think so I should not go there, but It tends to narrow and sectarianise them.<a name=48:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All this seems to me very simple, but it is not so easy to keep the spirits of all here to it, both in fidelity and love, for we are poor creatures.<a name=48:30></a> I know those who tend too much to looseness, others too much to narrowness.<a name=48:31></a> The Spirit of God alone can lead us in both, and that requires us to walk near Christ.<a name=48:32></a> But as to principles I have no difficulty; but without holiness and Christ being all, being emptied of self, we shall not practically succeed.<a name=48:33></a> God is light and love, but He alone can unite both and thus give a true and right unity.<a name=48:34></a>

		[Capt.<a name=51:1></a> Scott] DEAREST BROTHER, -- Eternal life in full is conformity to Christ in glory, according to the purpose of God.<a name=51:2></a> As life we receive it now: they did even when He was here, though, till the Holy Ghost came, they little knew what they had received.<a name=51:3></a> That He did quicken them, see John 5: 25: but when the Holy Ghost came, Christ in glory -- the pattern of this life in glory -- was revealed, and attached itself, so to speak, to the life which existed in the saints, and thus became the hope and formative power of the life of Christ in the saints here, and so their spring of joy.<a name=51:4></a> John always unfolds life as in this subjective state in us, but, beholding the glory of the Lord unveiled, we are changed into the same image from glory to glory.<a name=51:5></a> So Christ has sanctified Himself that we might be sanctified through the truth.<a name=51:6></a> Thus Paul who ever, as his general theme, presents us to God justified and glorified, never really speaks of the present eternal life of the Christian (the nearest to it is Romans 5 and 6; now, one is given in the well of water springing up into eternal life -- the glorious state, that into which it springs up -- and is life in the power of the Spirit, recognising this at least on the way to the glorious result in the mind of God) save at the end of his course [chapter 6: 22], which is generally taken as the close of this life: there is not much difference.<a name=51:7></a> The other is a mere image of its present operation.<a name=51:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As to your second question: I have never doubted (since studying it) that the departure from first love involved, in the general history, the final rejection of the professing church.<a name=51:9></a> The evil was greatly aggravated, but repentance and return continues for three churches: and in Thyatira space had been given to repent, and judgment, and the Morning Star and the kingdom take the place of the church.<a name=51:10></a> The rest are, as Protestantism, beyond as to the basis church structure; and all from Thyatira to the end of Philadelphia refer to the Lord's coming.<a name=51:11></a> There are always (Isaiah 5, 6) these two grounds of judgment: what God first made us, and -- Can we meet the Lord?<a name=51:12></a> departure in Adam, and Christ coming.<a name=51:13></a> So that, as to Ephesus, I agree with you.<a name=51:14></a>

		As to revision, a very large part is done, but not all, and what is has been sent to another Hebraist for Hebrew and French.<a name=51:15></a> That may delay.<a name=51:16></a> But I wait for my work to be closed which is very near, and one or two things relating to -- and if it lingers too long, I may very probably return before all is closed, even if I had to return here.<a name=51:17></a>

		But the grand point is that we get the bride in John.<a name=54:18></a> The bride aspect, the affections of the heart for Christ, is to be found there only; Paul does not name it, and this is 'characteristic of each.<a name=54:19></a>' I read through John's gospel -- not a trace or a hint of it, not a thought of anything corporate place, my answer is, The passage, where what of John, turn to them: total and confounding silence!<a name=54:20></a> The truth is, that John is exclusively and carefully individual in all his teaching.<a name=54:21></a> This is what, in this respect, unequivocally characterises him.<a name=54:22></a> But I forget 'Mary Magdalene, as it were, telling the brethren in the corporate place of blessing'; but this is another example of this misleading carelessness.<a name=54:23></a> There is nothing of bridal relationship, nothing corporate.<a name=54:24></a> If in this obscure phrase with no tail to it, it be said it is we who are in the corporate place, my answer is, The passage, where what was told is given, leads away from everything else to our wondrous relationship along with the blessed Saviour to His Father and God.<a name=54:25></a> Relationship with the glorified Man brings in the body and bride.<a name=54:26></a> (See Ephesians 1 and 4) This [John 20: 17] refers to individuals and the place of sons.<a name=54:27></a> The whole ground is wholly wrong.<a name=54:28></a> In John's teaching what is said to characterise it, is not found at all.<a name=54:29></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not know what is meant by 'naming,' but when I examine scripture, I find every one of the statements of the article baseless, wholly baseless, as to the alleged characterising facts.<a name=54:50></a> Paul is the only one who really teaches anything of that, the omission of which, we are told, characterises him.<a name=54:51></a> And in John's teaching, not one word is found of that which we are taught to look for in him.<a name=54:52></a> Paul is sober on such topics, and would have others not be led away from the simplicity that is in Christ.<a name=54:53></a> I entirely disagree, as to the fact, with what is said of the Reformers,<a href="#54:f3"><sup class="footnote-link">+++</sup></a> but my object is not controversy nor teaching.<a name=54:54></a> I would only add, that, pretending to be Philadelphia is quite another thing from being Philadelphia, and tends directly to Laodiceanism of heart.<a name=54:55></a> May the saints be kept in the simplicity that is in Christ.<a name=54:56></a> Assuredly I can have no wish to weaken true devotedness to Christ, Christ being all, which only is life; but I have not found this the effect of this teaching, but rather filling people with the thoughts of themselves and the wonderful new things they had got -- not a self-judging knowledge of Christ Himself.<a name=54:57></a> Nor do I a moment question that John has a peculiar place and character in the teaching of the Holy Ghost, specially in the revelation of the Father, and, through Him, immediate relationship with Him.<a name=54:58></a> But then only notice, that in the summing up and guarding of the system found in the article I comment on, what is true is old, and what is new is wrong.<a name=54:59></a>

		[Capt.<a name=59:1></a> Scott] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I have no doubt at all of the resurrection of the Old Testament saints.<a name=59:2></a> The answer of the Lord (Matthew 22; Luke 20), as well as other passages make it as clear as possible, as well as those you quote.<a name=59:3></a> But it is one of the characteristics of New Testament teaching, that it is teaching people, dealing with people, not with abstract doctrine or theology.<a name=59:4></a> Hence the teaching of the resurrection is the resurrection of those concerned in the teaching.<a name=59:5></a> Thus the apostle has in his mind those he was writing to: 1 Corinthians 15: 18, 22, 23, refer to Christians: verse 21 is more abstract -- resurrection of dead came by man.<a name=59:6></a> 1 Thessalonians 4: 14 clearly applies to Christians, verse 16 also.<a name=59:7></a> Revelation 14: 13 can refer to the saints which compose the church, but may to those slain afterwards also.<a name=59:8></a> Resurrection is always individual.<a name=59:9></a> There shall be a "resurrection of the just.<a name=59:10></a>" That takes in all, but in the body of the passages the apostle is thinking of those he was writing to; and life and incorruptibility were brought to light by the gospel.<a name=59:11></a> Daniel 7 gives us the slain saints under the beast as heavenly saints.<a name=59:12></a> 1 Thessalonians 3: 13 embraces all, I cannot doubt.<a name=59:13></a> But I have no doubt the apostle had specially in his mind those he was writing to.<a name=59:14></a> Such, as far as I see, is the mind of God in these passages.<a name=59:15></a> But Christ repeatedly speaks of saints in general.<a name=59:16></a>

		Dear Miss Maria Barton, -- I suppose I must have perceived that this objection could be raised, for in the fourth edition,<a href="#60:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> which I got to look at it, I have, 'All this (1 Thessalonians 4: 14-16) is a matter which belongs exclusively to the saints -- to those who, sleeping or waking, are Christ's, and who will be, from that moment, for ever with the Lord.<a name=60:1></a>' The truth is, the mind is justly occupied with what concerns the church; and so I find in the New Testament many passages refer directly to the christian saints who form the church, because they were there and then before the writer's or Holy Spirit's mind, which yet from other places we may know to be true of Old Testament saints.<a name=60:2></a> Here the word 'exclusively' meant to the exclusion of the wicked dead.<a name=60:3></a> I do not doubt the Old Testament saints will arise, though in many a passage they are not at all brought before the mind; because the Spirit was founding and encouraging the hopes of Christians then tried, perhaps persecuted, not meaning to deny that Old Testament saints would be in the kingdom.<a name=60:4></a> The word 'exclusively' does not apply here to the Old Testament saints, but to the world; but the mass of passages in the New Testament apply in fact only to the church.<a name=60:5></a> Other passages say we shall sit with Abraham and Isaac in the kingdom, and the Lord teaches clearly their resurrection.<a name=60:6></a> That which the Old Testament saints do not form is the body and the bride.<a name=60:7></a>

		[John James] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- Your letter has lain some days on my table, but I am constantly hard at work, from seven in the morning to eleven at night, and hard head work.<a name=60:9></a> The epistle you refer to, you must remember, was written to one who wielded derivatively the authority of the apostle, as his trusted and intimate companion.<a name=60:10></a> Still the directions given, when applying to general responsibility, apply now as ever.<a name=60:11></a> But you cannot have authority without really possessing it, nor did I over see the case of discipline which could be decided otherwise than in actually deciding it.<a name=60:12></a> Where it is a wicked person clearly, the case is pretty clear; but even then the question comes in, he really such?<a name=60:13></a> and the state and competency comes in.<a name=60:14></a> This was really the case with you, and in this condition of weakness, your yielding, God turned into blessing.<a name=60:15></a> If one such as Timothy rebuked, according to the apostle's order, he would carry the conscience of all the sound part of the assembly with him.<a name=60:16></a> But rebuke before all is different from rebuking one who not there, nor has it the effect in the same degree of making others fear.<a name=60:17></a> But if the assembly, or those who watch over it and carry the mind of the assembly with them, are agreed that it is not wickedness calling for excision, but cannot be passed over, I see nothing to hinder a person's being rebuked publicly.<a name=60:18></a> It was done at -- in a case where a man was overtaken in a fault which none would have know had he not voluntarily told of himself, and there was no question of his godliness or state of mind; but the world had more or less known it.<a name=60:19></a> And that is now forty years ago, I suppose, and I believe it has been done in several instances.<a name=60:20></a> But it requires the existence of moral authority to do it, and must now flow with the conscience of the assembly.<a name=60:21></a> If it is a case of putting away, and the assembly cannot decide -- and it is an act of the assembly, "put out from among yourselves" -- they must wait on the Lord to have spiritual unity of judgment; I do not say numerical unanimity.<a name=60:22></a> And even for an apostle it was so delicate a thing, that he regretted having written an inspired epistle, and one which had produced the desired effect really, and was deeply troubled and exercised.<a name=60:23></a> It is as to this he speaks of being not ignorant of Satan's devices .<a name=60:24></a>.<a name=60:25></a>.<a name=60:26></a> .<a name=60:27></a> In all these cases I look to the conscience of the assembly being exercised, that the weight of the assembly go with the act if anything short of excision; if it amount to that it is the assembly's act, the assembly purges itself.<a name=60:28></a> A rebuke never had that character, it was preventive to others, and a rod to the offender .<a name=60:29></a>.<a name=60:30></a>.<a name=60:31></a> .<a name=60:32></a>

		MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I hold it of all importance to maintain intact the discipline of God's house, as to not eating with those under discipline.<a name=63:1></a> I got a dreadful scolding from one for acting on it.<a name=63:2></a> Nor do I in the least blame -- .<a name=63:3></a> It is very well that the son should feel that the father did not feel lightly his son's getting put out.<a name=63:4></a> I should not eat with him, and if he ate at the same table, I should not enter into conversation with him, and if -- did, I should not like to be at the table.<a name=63:5></a> If the lad's spirit be at all subdued, and there was fear of alienating him by harshness, I might have him eat at the table, telling him that I could not have free intercourse with him.<a name=63:6></a> But as he was necessarily in the house I should not refuse letting him eat at the same table.<a name=63:7></a> But I could not keep company with him till he was humbled.<a name=63:8></a> This would not hinder anxious love as regards him, and the assurance of it; but familiarity and company at table, as if nothing had happened, I should not accept.<a name=63:9></a> I give my son his dinner if needed, I shew him my heart yearns over him, but I could not be familiar and at ease with him.<a name=63:10></a> I should not eat with, if even I ate at the same time.<a name=63:11></a> Something would depend on the age of the son, and how far he was under the father's authority.<a name=63:12></a> If young and under it, I must let him eat, and treat him as I would treat him as one under rebuke.<a name=63:13></a> If grown up and independent, I should be less disposed to do so.<a name=63:14></a>

		I am not, dear brother, a pessimist, because I may say, since my conversion, I never had a thought of any good in man or myself, while fully admitting amiable and nice natural characters, as I think the Lord did.<a name=65:5></a> But He did not trust it: He knew that all true good was beyond and behind.<a name=65:6></a> I fear rather drawing the line too sharp and too hard, for there is not a good, but a moral, nature in man.<a name=65:7></a> Hence we are born of water as well as of the Spirit: the word is the instrument, but all good is of God.<a name=65:8></a> When He loved the young man, He said, "None is good save one, that is God.<a name=65:9></a>" But I am not disheartened, though I may be cast down, because behind all there is God, One who never fails; and if He be for us, who can be against us?<a name=65:10></a> Only we have to know our own nothingness, and wait patiently for Him.<a name=65:11></a>

		[H C Anstey] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- In Job 2: 9 you have also from his wife, "Curse God and die.<a name=67:13></a>" In 1 Kings 21: 10 it cannot mean bless.<a name=67:14></a> If taken in this sense it must be a euphemism for cursing The usual explanation is this: $$$ r'K; (barak) means 'to kneel,' used for camels even: $$$ reK, (berek) is 'a knee,' hence 'to implore'; and there are two words, one Arabic the other Ethiopic, which have this uncertain sense (I know nothing of these languages).<a name=67:15></a> Hence while kneeling is the physical sense, it is to bless from above in Piel, and to cause (camels) to kneel down in Hiphil: but while some Hebraists, particularly Jews -- but Schultens and others -- will not allow the sense of cursing in this derivation of the word, and the Jews translate bless when we say curse, if you believe Gesenius it is as I have said above; others take it as derived from a word signifying 'to dismiss,' 'send off.<a name=67:16></a>' So Delitzsch interprets it in Job.<a name=67:17></a> In 1 Kings 21, his fellow-labourer also translates 'blasphemed'; but in explaining, derives from 'dismissing, or sending off,' saying, 'Which is the same as blasphemed.<a name=67:18></a>'

		I judge you are quite right as to the purport of the book, but all God's dealings and care are wonderfully brought out.<a name=67:19></a> "He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous" -- had considered Job before Satan; justified Job, by allowing Satan's efforts, from his charge of hypocrisy, and then takes him in His own hand for discipline, making him know himself in grace, and God in majesty; sends an interpreter, one among a thousand; and when he has owned both, blesses him more than ever.<a name=67:20></a>

		[To the same.<a name=69:10></a>] H C Anstey, I suspect your good vicar has never read Clemens Romanus, but only his (Mr.<a name=69:11></a> Marshall's) epitome: probably it was before he was born that I did.<a name=69:12></a> But you ought yourself to have had the answer ready.<a name=69:13></a> Clement speaks,  42, of bishops and deacons: but if there were several that is not episcopacy.<a name=69:14></a> There are only two classes -- so in Timothy and Titus, called also bishops and deacons.<a name=69:15></a> Titus was to appoint elders, several, in each city; and Paul goes on, "for a bishop must be blameless": bishops and deacons in 1 Timothy 3.<a name=69:16></a> So Paul in Acts 14 chose elders for them -- forgot the bishop!<a name=69:17></a> -- and in chapter 20 calls for the elders, and then says to them "bishops" -- again forgot the poor bishop or awfully despised him!<a name=69:18></a> We have thus the certainty that those whom Clement speaks of,  42, were several in one place.<a name=69:19></a> He always speaks in the plural.<a name=69:20></a> They appointed persons,  44.<a name=69:21></a> He does not think <i>those</i> should be thrown out of their ministry, and says, 'Blessed are those elders who, having finished their course before these times, have obtained a fruitful and perfect dissolution.<a name=69:22></a>' Clement, like Paul, ignores the existence of <i>a</i> bishop, writes (if there was one) to his church, without hinting at the existence of such a personage.<a name=69:23></a> 'Further we see that ye have put out <i>some</i> who lived,' etc.<a name=69:24></a> The letter is a letter from 'the church of God which is at Rome to the church of God which is at Corinth.<a name=69:25></a>' There is no trace, I repeat, of a bishop at Rome or at Corinth.<a name=69:26></a> The passage he refers to is the proof that he objected to their deposing their elders, but has no thought of any bishop, as the word is now used.<a name=69:27></a> Speaking of some -- 'You have put out some' -- though it was in the one church of Corinth; and calls them elders, for which archbishop Wake has translated 'priests' -- Chevalier, honestly, 'elders,' with 'presbyters' in margin.<a name=69:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You can easily see why I suspect your clergyman (I have not his name exactly) has read Marshall, which I have not, and not Clement, which I often have, and discussed with others, too.<a name=69:29></a> Perhaps he has not read Tertullian or Jerome either.<a name=69:30></a> Tertullian says John the apostle instituted them in Asia Minor, a plain proof Paul had not.<a name=69:31></a> Jerome says the church got into this plan as the elders were each trying to draw the faithful to themselves, and then they set up one as <i>primus inter pares</i>.<a name=69:32></a> In Alexandria, though there was a patriarch, Jerome tells us there was no episcopal ordination till Hesychius and the council of Nice.<a name=69:33></a> As to Justin, I do not remember his saying anything about bishops.<a name=69:34></a> He speaks largely of a president at their Lord's day meeting, and his praying as well as he could, also of his holding meetings at his lodgings, at Rome, when he went there.<a name=69:35></a> But I cannot now look them up; but I have read them more or less, and I am not aware of any such passage, or finding it quoted on the subject.<a name=69:36></a> Clement being short, and I having often read it, I could lay my hand on it.<a name=69:37></a> As to Clemens Alexandrinus, he may be quite at ease: in his day there were bishops plenty, but the reference is unfortunate, for, if I am to believe Jerome, there was then no episcopal ordination.<a name=69:38></a> As to Ignatius, all the rhetoric on the subject [notwithstanding], I have no doubt it is spurious.<a name=69:39></a> In the genuine Syriac copies a bishop is mentioned in this way once.<a name=69:40></a> Now I do not doubt, according to Jerome's account, they soon came in, possibly, partly through John, too.<a name=69:41></a> In Clement's time it is clear there were none such that he recognises -- 'not a trace' -- but what totally excludes the idea.<a name=69:42></a>

		As to Article XVII.<a name=69:43></a>, I quite admit that God's predestination is secret to us, but the seventeenth Article is not: it is very plain, and I think very good.<a name=69:44></a> I may add, in Clement,  57, where he exhorts the leaders of the sedition to submit to their elders.<a name=69:45></a> I have read some of Hooker, too; but [he was] one whose mind rested in human order, and not on scripture, but a reverend, godly man; but while a standard work with the clergy it is really intrinsically not worth reading.<a name=69:46></a> They say he died meditating on the hierarchical order of the angels.<a name=69:47></a> As to the Fathers, I have read some, consulted almost all, and some a good deal.<a name=69:48></a> But when, many years ago, I set about to read them, I found them as a body such trash that I gave it up as a study: for history they are of course useful, and I have examined them largely.<a name=69:49></a> Did Mr.<a name=69:50></a> -- ever read Hermas?<a name=69:51></a> If that is not enough to destroy all confidence in the early church, I do not know what would.<a name=69:52></a> Did he ever read Cyprian or Chrysostom on the state of the church in their days?<a name=69:53></a> Talking of looking to the primitive church for some doctrine or morality is the most wicked humbug that ever was: either people have not read what is patristic, or they must love and excuse wickedness.<a name=69:54></a> Hermas was read in the churches, and is quoted by Irenaeus as scripture, and Origen speaks of it as inspired.<a name=69:55></a> Pretty work you give one to do.<a name=69:56></a>

		As to Article XVII.<a name=71:11></a>, he confounds the counsels of God before the foundation of the world, and our knowledge of our election when we are called and justified, and cry Abba, Father.<a name=71:12></a> Whatever the means of assurance, I am necessarily assured that if I believe and am sealed so as to cry Abba Father, I know I shall be kept to the end; one, according to scripture and the seventeenth Article, involves the other.<a name=71:13></a> They that are called, says the article -- obey the calling -- are justified, etc.<a name=71:14></a>, and at length by God's mercy, attain everlasting felicity.<a name=71:15></a> So that the question, according to the article is, Can I know I am called and justified?<a name=71:16></a> for if so I shall attain everlasting felicity.<a name=71:17></a> Now scripture says -- first John as Christ's forerunner came to give the knowledge of salvation, then the blessed Lord says, "In that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you" -- and the apostle, "We have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.<a name=71:18></a>" So John writes, "I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.<a name=71:19></a>" I need not quote more.<a name=71:20></a> The epistles are addressed to saints, to the "elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit," and we are said to be saved, not merely as a principle (but in the perfect) seswsmevnoi, actually saved, for He has saved us, and called us with a holy calling -- fruits the proof in others, the Holy Spirit dwelling in us, in ourselves.<a name=71:21></a> "Knowing, dearly beloved, your election of God.<a name=71:22></a>" So 1 Thessalonians 5: 9.<a name=71:23></a>

		Now I would deprecate levity in so solemn a thing as the consciousness of our relationship to the Father.<a name=71:24></a> I had rather see a man deeply exercised in Romans 7 than taking up the <i>doctrine</i> of assurance with levity.<a name=71:25></a> And further, I see in the scripture the Christian looked at as not only in Christ, where there is no "if," but as running the race to attain actually the glory, as actual men in this world; and here I find "if," and working out our salvation with fear and trembling, and the responsibility of the saint comes in, but with a sure promise of being kept.<a name=71:26></a> And this is the difference in the <i>character</i> of the assurance; one is in an actually accomplished redemption, with the <i>knowledge</i> (John 14) that we are in Christ: the other, glory, is not an accomplished thing, as is evident; it is certain through the promise of God.<a name=71:27></a> See Romans 8, "Whom he justified, them he also glorified": the whole chain is there from beginning to end, and depends on His faithfulness in keeping us.<a name=71:28></a> And this distinction is morally very important, because it maintains constant <i>dependence</i>, but dependence on a faithfulness that cannot fail, which is most important for practical spiritual life.<a name=71:29></a> As regards my <i>path</i>, I am <i>kept</i>, and if so need it, but do not doubt God's faithfulness in doing it.<a name=71:30></a> I cannot speak of danger as to redemption, it is accomplished, but for my wilderness journey there is; but there is a keeping which exercises my dependence and faith.<a name=71:31></a> (See 1 Peter 1: 4, 5.<a name=71:32></a>) See, too, 1 Corinthians 1: 8, 9 -- where he then goes on to blame them for everything -- and the far happier testimony in John 10.<a name=71:33></a> I must close.<a name=71:34></a> This is more important than ecclesiastical questions or the Fathers.<a name=71:35></a> It is "that which is from the beginning.<a name=71:36></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		In Ephesians you will find plenty of exhortations but no "ifs": you do, when we are spoken of as yet on the journey.<a name=71:37></a> No doubt we see this, as all things, clearer if we are near to God, because what He is realised, and Christ dwells in our hearts by faith.<a name=71:38></a> We make our calling and election sure, not surer, of course, in God's mind, but in ours.<a name=71:39></a>

		As regards 2 Peter 1: 3, Tischendorf reads "by his own glory and virtue," ijdiva not diav, but it does not alter much.<a name=71:41></a> But in these are given the promises, the word communicates them to us as ours, and thus our moral delight is in them -- escaping the corruption of the world -- the heart is elsewhere.<a name=71:42></a> Peter never goes beyond the moral effect -- not the vital source: "suffered in the flesh," not "dead": born of the word, not of the Spirit.<a name=71:43></a> "Whereby" (2 Peter 1: 4) is dij w|n, and "by these" (diav touvtwn) the promises; the revelation of the glory and virtue (verse 3) to the soul is what produces the effect.<a name=71:44></a>

		The difference of 1 Corinthians 12 and Ephesians 4 is that one is the operation of the Spirit down here, distributing to every man as He will -- simple <i>power</i>, so that it might be stopped, as tongues, if no one understood or no interpreter or even more, at the most, than three prophets.<a name=71:45></a> Ephesians 4 it is Christ who takes care of His church, and this cannot cease or fail.<a name=71:46></a> Apostles and prophets <i>are</i> the foundation which cannot be laid now, it would be a new church: but these apart, Christ cannot fail to give what is needful for His church, and will to the end.<a name=71:47></a> Hence there are no miraculous gifts, so-called, spoken of.<a name=71:48></a> I am much better, but have again a cold.<a name=71:49></a><br>1880.<a name=71:50></a>

		[To the same.<a name=84:1></a>] E L Bevir, I have often pressed that, while God must open the way, the power of Christianity is not in what it finds, but in what it brings; but it is true that Christians are constantly exposed to follow the influences which surround them.<a name=84:2></a> But we must be with God, and so from Him, without ceasing to be with Him in all our dealings with others, representing Him, and acting for Him, in all the service He has given to us; and if we are content to be nothing, and seek Him, this is happily accomplished without effort, for He will be with us.<a name=84:3></a> He is faithful and gracious, and the result will be sure in His own time: in general, in these days, we have to await this, to have it solid.<a name=84:4></a> Still, we see cases, where the Spirit of God works manifestly; and though revival work is often shallow and superficial, I do not judge it as severely as some do, for I find when the blessed Lord speaks of Himself as sowing, only one out of the four lasts to bring forth fruit.<a name=84:5></a> You will be glad to hear that the desire for the word seems everywhere manifest .<a name=84:6></a>.<a name=84:7></a>.<a name=84:8></a> .<a name=84:9></a> They are dark times, but wherever Christ is fully preached, there are attentive and, through grace, receptive souls.<a name=84:10></a> We have only to work on.<a name=84:11></a>

		[F Rowan] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I do not take up -- 's objection to your tract, not from any slight of him, but because I have discussed the subject with him heretofore, and I think him the opposite, to say the least, to being clear on the subject, On that point I do not listen to him.<a name=85:1></a> But I am not quite satisfied with your tract: the mediatorial character of Christ on the subject of life disappears too much, and the life of God becomes too much the God of life or life in God.<a name=85:2></a> I agree with your tract in the main, though it does seek to make mentally clear what can be only spiritually clear, as it seems to me.<a name=85:3></a> I do not believe that "the life of God" is merely character of life.<a name=85:4></a> It involves, as indeed it always does, a true life which bears that character.<a name=85:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in John 5: 26 I have what makes me hesitate.<a name=85:6></a> It is not said life in Him, as in the Father Himself -- "hath," and "given to have," at once makes a vital difference.<a name=85:7></a> You could not say any one gave God to have life in Himself, and that, <i>because</i> He has it <i>in</i> Himself.<a name=85:8></a> It is not a question with me of Christ's true eternal Deity -- it is none, but of ejkevwse (Philippians 2: 7), and taking on Him the form of a servant, and so being dependent and obedient, a place He carefully and perfectly continued in.<a name=85:9></a> 'That life,' you say, 'which is proper to God dwells as fully in the incarnate Son as in the Godhead itself.<a name=85:10></a>' I do not say anything of 'as fully,' but in the same way is not true, for the Father has given to the Son (incarnate) to have life in Himself.<a name=85:11></a> This is not true of Godhead.<a name=85:12></a> You could not say that God lives diav any being.<a name=85:13></a> Christ says I live dia; to;n patevra (not tou' patrov") John 6: 57.<a name=85:14></a> And the subject here is just this descent of life and our living by Christ; and the flesh of Christ is distinctly brought in and His death.<a name=85:15></a> In John's gospel this reception from the Father is most carefully everywhere retained, while His own proper Deity shines all through most strikingly.<a name=85:16></a> Hence your phrase, 'is none other than the life of God -- the life which is proper to God, and which at the incarnation took up its abode, in all its divine fulness, in the Person of the Lord Jesus,' has hardly a clear sense.<a name=85:17></a> It never took up its abode in God, and it is never so said in scripture, but that the Father gave to the Son (incarnate) to have life in Himself.<a name=85:18></a> This leads me to add here, that "That which was from the beginning," in 1 John 1 is not for me eternal, but the incarnate Word down here, as chapter 2 clearly shews.<a name=85:19></a> Further, remark that in John 1, where we have abstractedly what Christ was -- "in him was life," and, I doubt not, divinely and eternally -- as such it is light, which is not received at all.<a name=85:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not agree with your interpretation of "gave power to become sons";<a href="#85:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> for we are sons uiJoiv by faith in Him -- quickening power was needed to receive Him.<a name=85:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I admit the life is never 'detached from its source'; "because I live, ye shall live also": but 'enjoyed in common'<a href="#85:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a> -- this tends to destroy its mediatorial character at the other end, for 'in common' is as if we had both received it alike from some common source: Hebrews 2: 11 goes the farthest.<a name=85:22></a> And you go so far as to say, 'in common with God its fountain.<a name=85:23></a>' (page 34.<a name=85:24></a>) Now scripture goes very far in this direction, though not so speaking of life: we dwell in God and God in us.<a name=85:25></a> But here again mediatorship is left out.<a name=85:26></a> True it is that Christ and God are identified in John's epistle: still, in chapter 4: 9, we get the mediatorial character.<a name=85:27></a> I have no difficulty as to divine nature.<a name=85:28></a> Christ is our life, and he who has the Son of God has life, and he has the life of Jesus, which if shewn out is <i>there</i> to be shewn out.<a name=85:29></a> All this I should insist on, and have long and largely so done, and as I fully admit and thank God for it -- never detached: but 'in common with God its fountain' you will not find.<a name=85:30></a> Christ is our life: but Paul connects this with another truth you have not touched.<a name=85:31></a> We are raised with Christ, He having become, as to life down here, a dead Man; and in Colossians we are raised with Him, in Ephesians -- quickened with Him and raised, Jew or Gentile, and seated in heavenly places.<a name=85:32></a> But here He is looked at, not as a source of life, but as raised by God's power.<a name=85:33></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I could not say that life was not communicated, for surely if a man is born, life is communicated, only I admit not life in us as a separate thing.<a name=85:34></a> "He that hath the Son hath life": God's "seed remaineth in him.<a name=85:35></a>" In speaking of vegetable and animal life as you do, conscious, voluntary action in mind or body, and important and reflectively only in man, is left out; and, to say the least, it greatly characterises life itself, if not a definition.<a name=85:36></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Growing up to Him who is the Head, has scarcely its place in your account of holiness.<a name=85:37></a> Christ is eternal life: we have Him as life; and it will be complete when like Him in glory, and we "are changed into the same image from glory to glory.<a name=85:38></a>" So He has sanctified Himself that we might be sanctified through the truth.<a name=85:39></a> The nature which grows is holy, I admit, in itself.<a name=85:40></a> Your account of sealing (page 39) I doubt the exactness of.<a name=85:41></a> When examined in detail, I find it based on faith in the blood and its efficacy in remission, so in the type of the leper.<a name=85:42></a> I do not think tevkna and uiJoiv quite so distinct as you make them (page 40), though I admit the difference: Galatians 3 is uiJov"; John uses tevkna; but Romans 8: 14-17 shews it is not merely characteristic style.<a name=85:43></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		-- sent me 'New Creation.<a name=85:44></a>' I think nature's relationships are too much lost in it.<a name=85:45></a> God holds to all <i>He created</i> in the first creation.<a name=85:46></a> "From the beginning it was not so.<a name=85:47></a>" "God made them male and female.<a name=85:48></a>" "What therefore God hath joined together": this holds good as long as man, in the body and natural life, is there.<a name=85:49></a> I do not know what you mean by the new creation being complete and perfect in Christ.<a name=85:50></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have not quoted Christ's breathing on His disciples in connection with life, as it may be disputed; but we have Him "come that they might have life, and have it more abundantly.<a name=85:51></a>" I rejoice with all my heart, both for your own sake and the Lord's goodness in the blessing He has given you.<a name=85:52></a> In general there is much thirst for the word now, so that brethren are a good deal encouraged in faithful service.<a name=85:53></a>

		Mr Mahoney, I know well how few know deliverance; but it is a great thing to know that I, a poor worm, should be before God and the Father in the same acceptance and favour that Christ is, loved even as He is loved.<a name=90:1></a> But it is the greatness of infinite love.<a name=90:2></a> Then it is not generally preached with intelligence; next, it is experimental; and, above all, we must be in earnest to have it.<a name=90:3></a> Who is willing to be dead to what nature and flesh would desire?<a name=90:4></a> Yet that is the only way of deliverance.<a name=90:5></a> People will tell you it is our standing in Christ.<a name=90:6></a> I admit it as Colossians 3, and as faith owns in Romans 6 and Galatians 2; but who is willing to be in the standing?<a name=90:7></a> It is standing, or else we are in the hopeless effort of Romans 7, or an honest monks' labour, which I have tried; and even if we have experimentally learned, as it must be learned, who is carrying out 2 Corinthians 4, so as to have the conscience living in it by an ungrieved spirit?<a name=90:8></a> But if experimentally taught, it is of the greatest use to souls; and the joy of being blameless in Christ before God is exceeding great, and one that is eternal and divine in its source and nature -- a wonderful thing; "for he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.<a name=90:9></a>" The world is a terrible snare and a subtle one, and greatly hinders this deliverance.<a name=90:10></a> A soul enjoying deliverance has its object elsewhere.<a name=90:11></a> (See Romans 8) Then we must remember, "the soul of the diligent shall be made fat.<a name=90:12></a>" I press, when souls are in earnest, "My grace is sufficient for thee, and my strength is made perfect in weakness.<a name=90:13></a>" For we learn we are without strength for deliverance, and walk in the sense of it if we can be used in service; but His grace is sufficient.<a name=90:14></a> Knowing we are nothing is the place of blessing, for then God is everything; and the place of strength, for then Christ can put forth His strength.<a name=90:15></a> In this 2 Corinthians 12 is a most instructive chapter.<a name=90:16></a> Strength for service may be found, in what is within alone between us and God, [and] may be found, in the third heavens; but strength in it is found in Christ, when we are kept in the abiding consciousness that we can do nothing.<a name=90:17></a> We all know it.<a name=90:18></a> If we have not a permanent thorn in the flesh, we must at any rate return to the camp at Gilgal.<a name=90:19></a>

		[C Crain] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- These cases of discipline are always difficult, and test the state of the assembly.<a name=91:1></a> I do not pretend to have much gift for them, and it depends on the spiritual discernment of those who deal with it.<a name=91:2></a> I have no doubt an annihilationist should be put away: it always really denies the atonement, responsibility, the immortality of the soul, and every just sense of sin.<a name=91:3></a> The main question is, Does he hold it now?<a name=91:4></a> I would say that dear -- , whose devotedness I know, is apt to deal rapidly and harshly in discipline, yet I cannot think it an evil that the assembly has given thereby a plain testimony, that it will not accept those who hold such doctrine: but this testimony it has given, and I am very thankful for it.<a name=91:5></a> The question, whether he held it then, does not affect this one way or another The only thing that affects my mind is the subtle infecting poison of these doctrines; and hence the getting assured that not only the open holding of the doctrine, but the infection of the doctrine, does not remain, for it chimes in with the flesh and human nature.<a name=91:6></a> But if he be perfectly clear <i>now</i>, the assembly did clear themselves, for which as to it I am very thankful; and I see no reason why he should not be received.<a name=91:7></a> It is a good sign that he justifies the assembly, but I may say, that we have no right to keep out God's children if they are sound in doctrine and godly in practice.<a name=91:8></a> The point is, Is he really clear, and does he judge the doctrine as evil, and really the denial [of what is] fundamental for souls; for, I repeat, if we have only animal-living souls, responsibility and atonement are gone.<a name=91:9></a> If God gave a dog eternal life he would not have to answer for what he had done, nor [need] a Saviour either; and I never met one who had not lost atonement: even if Christians their minds had lost it, and I have had to say to plenty of them.<a name=91:10></a> Besides, if death is ceasing to exist, as they hold, Christ ceased to exist, and the foundations of faith are gone; and this was admitted to me by two of the most respectable of them at Boston.<a name=91:11></a> Does he, then, clearly judge the evil?<a name=91:12></a> Only seek [that there should not be] any breach of unity, for questions of discipline always tend to that.<a name=91:13></a> But our trust is, as you say, the Lord is above it all .<a name=91:14></a>.<a name=91:15></a>.<a name=91:16></a> .<a name=91:17></a>

		There are three things I find in the often trying and toilsome life of faith: first, trusting God that nothing can hinder His accomplishing His purpose.<a name=92:12></a> All that his brethren did to frustrate the accomplishment of Joseph's dreams, just led to that accomplishment.<a name=92:13></a> They sent him to Egypt.<a name=92:14></a> The hard and wicked accusation against him in Potiphar's house put him in prison, where he met the butler and baker who brought him where the dream was fulfilled.<a name=92:15></a> Next, for us, simple obedience, taking God's mind for wisdom, and doing His will.<a name=92:16></a> He has a path for His saints in this world; in it they find Him and His strength, though perhaps the life of faith be dark: then, if we know the purpose of God, light is in the soul.<a name=92:17></a> But the path He will guide us in.<a name=92:18></a> It may seem dark, but, if His, it is the way of arriving at His rest.<a name=92:19></a> But a single eye seeking nothing but Christ is the secret of certainty of walk, and firmness as having the secret of the Lord with you.<a name=92:20></a> But what a calling!<a name=92:21></a> we have to walk worthy of God who has called us to His own kingdom, and yet what a joy to be thus associated with Himself!<a name=92:22></a> And we know His purpose is to glorify Christ, and so we seek that, in walking worthy of Him and serving Him in love.<a name=92:23></a>

		Did you ever notice Luke 12, the two things looked for in us?<a name=92:24></a> First, watching; its reward, making us sit down to table in heaven, and ministering the blessing to us; and then serving in what He sets us to do, and the reward of that, ruling.<a name=92:25></a> But the first is wonderful, that He remains for ever our servant in love.<a name=92:26></a> How blessed to have Him, and be His!<a name=92:27></a> There is progress in the Song of Songs.<a name=92:28></a> First, He is ours; next, we are His; and then I am my Beloved's, and His desire is towards me.<a name=92:29></a> That is wonderful to say!<a name=92:30></a> The riches of scripture, both for knowledge and for affections, is beyond our thoughts -- no wonder, as it comes from God; but it is all ours.<a name=92:31></a> But the perfectness of our place is wonderful; and I do not mean now as to glory, true as that is, but morally.<a name=92:32></a> He is given to be the Object of our affections who is sufficient for the Father's; and to have Him in His path down here even is the food of the soul.<a name=92:33></a> Energy comes from seeing Him up there (Philippians 3), likeness to Him from feeding on Him down here.<a name=92:34></a> (Philippians 2)

		DEAREST BROTHER, -- I was very glad to get your news, and that thus far the Lord has helped.<a name=95:1></a> My conviction is that, though we might like increase of numbers, yet, from the state of Italy, very godly care -- not suspicion -- should be exercised in receiving into communion.<a name=95:2></a> Some may stay back thus who ought to be in, but testimony to Christ is maintained in its integrity.<a name=95:3></a> Deliverance from popery is a great blessing, and at first it took that character, and I doubt not there are many scattered converted souls, but gathering is another thing: "He that gathereth not with me scattereth.<a name=95:4></a>" Very ignorant souls may be rightly gathered, if there is godliness and integrity and lowliness; but we are called to walk with those who call on the name of the Lord out of a pure heart.<a name=95:5></a>

		DEAR -- , -- -- 's notion is nothing new; it is held by many mystic evangelicals in a somewhat different shape, perhaps, but it is only a notion .<a name=96:1></a>.<a name=96:2></a>.<a name=96:3></a> .<a name=96:4></a> The general notion I have alluded to is, that there is a kind of essence or germ of the body which remains, and is glorified, which would involve the exuviae.<a name=96:5></a> But I have a horror of all notions, they are not Christ, and His unsearchable riches, and if the soul is full of Him, notions do not rise or suggest themselves.<a name=96:6></a> 1 Corinthians 15: 38 answers it: "God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him," and what is sown in corruption is raised in incorruption, and what is sown in dishonour is raised in glory; and if we pretend to go further, we go beyond what is written, and are in danger of being designated a fool.<a name=96:7></a> There is no such minuteness of comparison as this notion would find: it takes it to shew generally a resurrection in incorruption and glory, out of the grave of corruption and dishonour; but the exuviae is a thought man's mind adds; but, as has been said of old, we are to bring ideas from scripture, not to it.<a name=96:8></a> It was a natural body, and becomes a spiritual body.<a name=96:9></a> When the living are changed there are no exuviae: Christ could shew His hands and feet pierced.<a name=96:10></a> It is a change; the corruptible puts on incorruption, and what is mortal, immortality.<a name=96:11></a> These notions are the product of men's minds, and not what flows from the fulness of Christ, and that is the evil; and if we harbour them, it tends to shut Him out.<a name=96:12></a> But we have to bear with idle notions, and not strive.<a name=96:13></a> The best thing is to bring in Christ, and they fall or collapse by their own emptiness.<a name=96:14></a>

		Spiritual life wants cultivating; it is this we must look to, that there may be a true testimony.<a name=99:5></a> The brethren in England are somewhat aroused, but we have still much to seek that the Spirit of God and the life of Christ may pervade the mass.<a name=99:6></a> For this not only the privileges of the church must be held out, but Christ Himself.<a name=99:7></a> The other is all right, needed to clear us as to the mixed deadness of the name of Christian, and brighten our hopes; I should ever insist on it, it is what brought me out; but it is not what sustains life and forms the affections.<a name=99:8></a> "He that eateth me shall live by me.<a name=99:9></a>" This alone gives singleness of eye, and fixes the mind as to its object.<a name=99:10></a> It is never said of the church, but of Christ He is all.<a name=99:11></a> "Christ is all, and in all" -- "all" as object, "in all" as power of life to enjoy Him, and know the Father.<a name=99:12></a>

		I have had, through mercy, a good time in Ireland, and in Dublin a great desire after the word.<a name=99:13></a> The brethren have been greatly interested in reading it; indeed, we have found it commonly thus.<a name=99:14></a> Kent remains unsettled, but I have heard nothing of it since -- began to break bread.<a name=99:15></a> It is not what in itself tries me, but a party right in their desire for good, but pretending to set up something new and holy, and, I think, despising God's patience with what I admit has greatly failed; but I feel one must take this, as all else, as under His hand; but I do not see them to be guided of God.<a name=99:16></a> I do not believe it is faith.<a name=99:17></a> I have to learn, in them, for myself, that patience may have its perfect work.<a name=99:18></a> After all, God continues blessing in spite of it all.<a name=99:19></a> I dread the world; and a nourishing with Christ, and cementing power of the Spirit is needed, so that both the object and the power should bind all together, and the truth spread by a divine testimony.<a name=99:20></a> To His working we must look.<a name=99:21></a>

		It is a great comfort to think He is always right, and always does right.<a name=99:22></a> He loves the church, and in the midst of all our failures carries on His work of loving grace towards it, to "present it to himself a glorious church, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing.<a name=99:23></a>" And, individually, such a High Priest <i>became us</i> as was "holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, made higher than the heavens," yet we have not One "who cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are, sin apart.<a name=99:24></a>" We belong to there, yea, go in boldly; but are here sanctified in spirit for that place which He has prepared for us by His entry there, and exercised and helped here by a sympathy and mercy which, while it is met by dependence in us, is a living and gracious sustainment, and gives blessed confidence.<a name=99:25></a> On Him we can count; He loves the church now as ever, and though our hearts are weak, how often have I seen His hand come in where all seemed hopeless.<a name=99:26></a> As men have said, 'Man's extremity is God's opportunity,' and so it is, and even in our souls -- where to know deliverance is, that we must have learned we cannot deliver ourselves.<a name=99:27></a> Peace be with you.<a name=99:28></a>

		[J Dunlop] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I was glad to see your hand and name, and answer you at once.<a name=100:1></a> I object altogether to the question What benefit does the world get from [propitiation]?<a name=100:2></a> It puts everything on a false and low ground, as if the end and only object of God's ways -- leaving out the claims of His glory and nature in that which angels desire to look into.<a name=100:3></a> I agree in general with what you say; but "the Lord's lot" was not for the sins of the people, as guilt, though God's holy and righteous nature was met in respect of their sin.<a name=100:4></a> The blood was sprinkled first, on and before the mercy-seat -- God's throne in the most holy place where God dwelt -- and the altar of incense.<a name=100:5></a> The atonement was for the "holy place .<a name=100:6></a>.<a name=100:7></a>.<a name=100:8></a> that remaineth among them.<a name=100:9></a>" "That is for the people," (verse 15) is in contrast with Aaron and his house.<a name=100:10></a> But what was cleansed and hallowed was the holy place, and the altar, no doubt, because of the tabernacle being among them.<a name=100:11></a> As meeting God's nature and character, it was the basis of all.<a name=100:12></a> (Compare Hebrews 9: 23-26 and 27, 28.<a name=100:13></a>) The taking away the sin of the world was to have "a new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness" -- is the fruit of the sacrifice of the Lamb of God.<a name=100:14></a> Thank God!<a name=100:15></a> our sins are taken away, too, but that is a different thing from putting away sin.<a name=100:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is deplorable to make putting away our sins, true and blessed as it is, the end of all.<a name=100:17></a> God has been glorified in Him (John 13) in such sort, that Man is in the glory of God.<a name=100:18></a> In the scapegoat, God's people were represented in their head -- the high priest -- and those only who, as such, were identified with him.<a name=100:19></a> In the other there was no such representation -- a most important principle.<a name=100:20></a> Though the people's uncleanness were the occasion of it, it was the Lord's lot, His dwelling-place which was in question, and transgressions not in question, save as the means of its defilement; and the blood was under God's eye as the ground of all God's dealings till, and making the security of, the new heavens and the new earth.<a name=100:21></a> (See John 13: 31, 32.<a name=100:22></a>) Through the cross, God Himself has been fully glorified, and in virtue of it Christ Himself has entered into the glory of God as Man, though He had it before the world was.<a name=100:23></a> (So Philippians 2) Man's sin was absolute, Satan's power over all the world, man's perfection absolute in Christ when absolutely tested, God's righteous judgment against sin displayed as nowhere else, and perfect love to the sinner, His majesty made good.<a name=100:24></a> "It became him.<a name=100:25></a>" (Hebrews 2) No doubt our sins were borne too, thank God!<a name=100:26></a> that we might have part in the results; but blessed as this is for us, it was really a secondary thing to the basis of the glory of God in the universe, and the bringing all into order, according to what He is fully displayed.<a name=100:27></a> So John 17: 4, 5.<a name=100:28></a> But in John's gospel there is not a word of the forgiveness of our sins, save as administered by the apostles.<a name=100:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Finally, the people were not represented in the blood on the mercy-seat and holy place; their sins gave occasion to its being done but the cleansing was of God's dwelling-place, that that should be fit for Him, and what He was, perfectly glorified by Christ's death -- to be for ever before Him as eternal redemption.<a name=100:30></a> The two goats made but one Christ in different aspects.<a name=100:31></a> But propitiation alters the whole ground of God's dealings with man.<a name=100:32></a> It is the display of God's mercy maintaining God's righteousness, but opening the door to the sinner -- the ground on which I preach the gospel, and can say to every sinner, The blood is on the mercy-seat; return to God, and it will be His joy to receive you: it is not necessary for Him to judge you if you so come, for His righteousness is fully glorified, and His love free.<a name=100:33></a> This may bring out the evil will in man, but it is then "ye will not come to me that ye might have life.<a name=100:34></a>" There is death in substitution -- He "bore our sins in his own body on the tree" -- "died for our sins according to the scriptures": as I have said, the two goats are one Christ.<a name=100:35></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The word "lost" is not a different word.<a name=100:36></a> Christ came to seek sinners, not repentant sinners.<a name=100:37></a> God leads to repentance.<a name=100:38></a> We have the repentant sinner in the third parable -- the seeking in the two first.<a name=100:39></a> (Luke 15) The "lost" in them has, of course a physical sense as a figure, but there was no thought of their disposition to return.<a name=100:40></a> It is a miserable denial of the gospel; "God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.<a name=100:41></a>" The figure of their being carried clean away, not to be found, may be given, but that forgiveness and redemption are by blood-shedding is stated everywhere -- no remission of sins without it.<a name=100:42></a> "We have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins.<a name=100:43></a>" Luke 19: 10 is also "lost" -- the same word .<a name=100:44></a>.<a name=100:45></a>.<a name=100:46></a> .<a name=100:47></a>

		DEAR -- , -- First, I do not think you have put in adequate prominence, at starting, Hebrews 10, distinguishing the Spirit's work which gives us the sense of our sins at conversion (and can only of past ones) and Christ's work when all were future and the efficacy of which was not only up to the day of our conversion.<a name=102:1></a> Next, I believe 1 John 1: 5-10 to be abstract the message received from Christ come.<a name=102:2></a> Chapter 2: 1, as you say, is clearly believers; but confession of sins is at the beginning and all along.<a name=102:3></a> Walking in light, fellowship, and cleansing, are the three elements of the christian state.<a name=102:4></a> Chapter 2: 1, as you say, begins with the saints: it was for them he wrote what went before, but what he wrote was abstract truth, the message But I think chapter 1: 9 is present application: uprightness in confession brings forgiveness in relationship -- not merely justification.<a name=102:5></a>

		Dear H M Hooke, -- 1 John 1: 7 I believe to be an abstract statement, as I might say, Quinine cures intermittent fever: it is its quality and effect.<a name=102:6></a> Abstract, absolute statements characterise John: "he cannot sin;" "the wicked one toucheth him not.<a name=102:7></a>" As to verse 9, it is the same, only it is subjective -- the state and act of the person.<a name=102:8></a> If a person confesses his sins he is forgiven: his soul must be in that state to be forgiven.<a name=102:9></a> Only when it is at the outset, it is justification once for all, afterwards governmental: in the first case, non-imputation; in the second, the dealings of God with His people or children.<a name=102:10></a> And the difference is important, connected with the revelation made in Christianity.<a name=102:11></a>

		MY DEAR SIR, -- I have received your tract, and am glad to have done so, as it affords me an opportunity to give a little more fully the scriptural evidence of the Deity of the Lord.<a name=103:1></a> How much it pained me to read it, I cannot tell you; but I apply myself at once to the point.<a name=103:2></a> The rash expressions of individuals are nothing to the purpose: the question is, what does scripture say?<a name=103:3></a> No Christian denies he should pray to the Father, but it is equally certain the Lord is prayed to -- nay, calling upon the name of the Lord Jesus is, so to speak, a definition of a Christian in 1 Corinthians 1: 2.<a name=103:4></a> Stephen called on the Lord Jesus to receive his spirit, and Paul that the thorn might be taken from him.<a name=103:5></a> A child prays to his Father, but the administration of the house is in the Lord's hands.<a name=103:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a strange assertion that the scriptures do not say that Jesus is God: and I pray you to note that the question connects itself directly with that of What was He before He was a man?<a name=103:7></a> "The Word was with God, and the Word <i>was God</i>.<a name=103:8></a>" "And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.<a name=103:9></a>" You will not deny that that was Jesus: did God, for such the Word was, cease to be God?<a name=103:10></a> He was "in the form of God," laid aside His glory, "and took upon him the form of a servant;" but He is called God: Jesus is Emmanuel, God with us.<a name=103:11></a> (Matthew 1: 23.<a name=103:12></a>) The scriptures do therefore call Him God.<a name=103:13></a> Again, Jesus means Jah, or Jehovah the Saviour; His name states that He is Jehovah: is not Jehovah God?<a name=103:14></a> Jesus received it, because He was to "save his people from their sins" -- whose people?<a name=103:15></a> Hence, in John 12, the evangelist cites a passage from Isaiah 6, where the highest glory of Jehovah is displayed, and says (verse 41) the prophet saw Christ's glory and spake of Him.<a name=103:16></a> Hence the Lord says to the Jews, "Destroy <i>this temple</i>, and in three days I will raise it up.<a name=103:17></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Your question as to the Son of David is nothing to the purpose; no one says God is the Son of David: all Christians own that Christ was born into the world as a man: what they say is that the Son of David was also God.<a name=103:18></a> Take the end of 1 John 2 and beginning of 3 -- in chapter 2: 28, "he shall appear;" that is, Christ: in verse 29, saints are "born of him;" but they are "sons of God" in chapter 3: 1; but the world "knew him not": that is, the same Person is Christ on earth.<a name=103:19></a> In verse 2 we are "the sons of God," but, "when he shall appear;" now it is Christ.<a name=103:20></a> No one can read this passage and not see that Christ and God were one Object or Person before the apostle's mind; and so at the end of the epistle, "We are in him that is true, that is, in his Son Jesus Christ: this [He] is the true God and eternal life.<a name=103:21></a>" And even the Old Testament knows this.<a name=103:22></a> In Daniel 7 the Son of man comes to the Ancient of days (verse 13), but further on in the course of the chapter, the Ancient of days comes.<a name=103:23></a> (verse 22) So in Revelation 1: 17: "The first and the last" is "he that liveth and was dead.<a name=103:24></a>" In chapter 1: 8, Alpha and Omega is the Almighty; in chapter 22: 12, 13, it is Christ who comes.<a name=103:25></a> In 1 Timothy 6: 14, 16, "the blessed and only Potentate" is "King of kings and Lord of lords," but in Revelation 19: 16 this is Christ.<a name=103:26></a> In John 17.<a name=103:27></a> He looks to be glorified with the Father, but He had had it before the world was.<a name=103:28></a> What He says is that He does and can do nothing as originated by Himself, <i>ajfj eJautou</i>' (John 5: 19) The same is said of the Holy Ghost (chapter 16: 13), "He shall not speak of himself" -- <i>ajfj eJautou</i>' "from himself" as a source.<a name=103:29></a> No Christian denies He took the form of a servant, and always so lived on the earth: but who "<i>took upon him</i> the form of a servant"?<a name=103:30></a> Not an angel; he is a servant, and cannot leave his first estate.<a name=103:31></a> Christ "made himself of no reputation" when He was in the form of God: was it a false form?<a name=103:32></a> The Lord forgive the question: I put it for your sake, dear sir.<a name=103:33></a> He could say, "before Abraham was I AM.<a name=103:34></a>" The fulness of the Deity, you admit, dwelt in Him.<a name=103:35></a> The Son of David was much more than the Son of David: "God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself.<a name=103:36></a>" Whose thoughts and words were Christ's?<a name=103:37></a> were they not a man's, yet whose?<a name=103:38></a> He could say "the Son of man who is in heaven.<a name=103:39></a>" What was He before He came down?<a name=103:40></a> Was the Word which became flesh (sa;rx ejgevneto) before [He became so] God or not?<a name=103:41></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Proving He was Man, proves nothing; we all believe it as fundamental truth: but was He only a man?<a name=103:42></a> Clearly not: He was "the Word:" He "came down from heaven.<a name=103:43></a>" What was He then before He became a man?<a name=103:44></a> He claims to be One with the Father (John 10: 30) -- can a creature?<a name=103:45></a> If He was not a creature He was God; or we have one not created at all, of independent existence in Himself, yet not God, which is confusion and impossible.<a name=103:46></a> "By him were all things created:" who did that?<a name=103:47></a> He is the Firstborn of the creation, because He created it: all things, moreover, consist by Him.<a name=103:48></a> (Colossians 1: 16) He was "in the beginning," and then by him were all things made that are made.<a name=103:49></a> (John 1: 1, 3) He, then, was not made: are there two Gods?<a name=103:50></a> He laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of His hands; they perish, but He remains.<a name=103:51></a> (Hebrews 1: 8, 10, 11) All the angels of God are to worship Him.<a name=103:52></a> (verse 6) "Blessed are all they that put their trust in him" (Psalm 2: 12), but "cursed be the man that trusteth in man.<a name=103:53></a>" (Jeremiah 17: 5) He and the Father are one: can any creature say that?<a name=103:54></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I find, then, that He is called God before He came into the world (John 1), after He came into the world -- "God with us.<a name=103:55></a>" He created all things, and "by him all things consist," is to be worshipped as the first and the last, Alpha and Omega -- which is the express title of the Almighty, King of kings and Lord of lords, the Ancient of days: and, lest we should think Him some inferior God, we are told that all the fulness of the Godhead (qeovthto") dwelt in Him bodily.<a name=103:56></a> (Colossians 2: 9) The moral teaching of scripture confirms it.<a name=103:57></a> "Christ is all" to the Christian, so that if He be not God, God is nothing.<a name=103:58></a> The object of the supreme devotion of the heart, I am to live to Him (2 Corinthians 5: 15); is this to a creature?<a name=103:59></a> This is the real question: Is He the creature or the Creator?<a name=103:60></a> No Christian denies that He is true, very Man, and that He has taken a place inferior to the Father; but for this He made Himself of no reputation when in the form of God, and took upon Him the form of a servant: no creature could do that; he is one by nature.<a name=103:61></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		He was, as you say, the foreordained Second Adam, but that Second Adam was the Lord from heaven.<a name=103:62></a> (1 Corinthians 15: 47) He came not to do His own will surely; as Man, obedience and dependence was His place, but He came into a prepared body having offered Himself to do it.<a name=103:63></a> You may say, He is Son of God.<a name=103:64></a> What do you mean by that?<a name=103:65></a> "Kiss the Son lest he be angry.<a name=103:66></a>" God spoke ejn uiJw' (Hebrews 1: 1) The exaltation of Jesus, of which you speak, was after He had been "made a little lower than the angels [whom He had created] for the suffering of death," being "made like to his brethren in all things.<a name=103:67></a>" He "maketh his angels spirits .<a name=103:68></a>.<a name=103:69></a>.<a name=103:70></a> but unto the Son he saith Thy throne, O God" -- He does not make Him anything.<a name=103:71></a> Would the blood of a mere man cleanse from all sin?<a name=103:72></a>

		How you can say the scriptures do not say He is God, I do not understand: they do over and over again, directly and indirectly, in equivalent terms.<a name=103:73></a> I have not quoted "God manifest in the flesh," "Christ who is over all, God blessed for ever," as critics may reason about them.<a name=103:74></a> The last, however (Romans 9: 5) is as plain a testimony as can well be conceived, and the language such as makes it impossible to apply it to any one but Christ.<a name=103:75></a> Is it not singular that you should have passed over all the passages I have referred to, and only quoted what shews that Christ was truly a man, which nobody denies -- without which, indeed, His Godhead is of no avail to us?<a name=103:76></a> I cannot in the compass of a note pretend to discuss fully such a subject.<a name=103:77></a> But all scripture confirms the truth, that Jesus is Jehovah.<a name=103:78></a> John the Baptist was "the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord" -- that is, Jehovah (Isaiah 40): so Luke 7: 27, from Malachi 3: 1: so Luke 1: 76: so when He says to the leper, "I <i>will</i>, be thou clean.<a name=103:79></a>" In Isaiah 66: 15 Jehovah comes with fire and the sword, but we know it is Christ who comes.<a name=103:80></a> What is the meaning of Micah 5: 2?<a name=103:81></a> Who is Jehovah's fellow?<a name=103:82></a> (Zechariah 13: 7.<a name=103:83></a>) The cleansing of the leper was Jehovah's work: the feeding of the five thousand, a reference to the Psalms speaking of Jehovah; and though done as Son of man (Luke 9: 10-17 and following) accomplished Psalm 132: 15, spoken of Jehovah.<a name=103:84></a> He not only works miracles, which God can enable any one, if He pleases, to do, but He confers the power of working them by His own power on others, which man cannot do.<a name=103:85></a> (Luke 9) All these I refer to as confirmations of the direct statements of scripture that He is God, and they are consistent with no other doctrine.<a name=103:86></a> And they might be multiplied by reference to every page of the gospel.<a name=103:87></a> He quickens whom He will (John 5: 21); can that be said of a mere man, a creature?<a name=103:88></a> The Old Testament declares that Jehovah was to come, and His way be prepared, but this was Christ.<a name=103:89></a> Hebrews 12: 25, 26, shew positively that Christ is the Jehovah of mount Sinai.<a name=103:90></a>

		I do not write in a controversial spirit, and beg you to weigh the passages, because it is the greatest of all comforts to know that God did thus come down and become a man -- reveal Himself to us so near us.<a name=103:91></a> I know God in knowing Christ, find Him grace and love, and cannot in any other way know Himself.<a name=103:92></a> May the gracious Lord give you to see it!<a name=103:93></a>

		[P (S?<a name=107:1></a>) Loizeaux] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- Mr.<a name=107:2></a> -- assures me, for I had written to him, that he is quite sure that he joins heartily in praise and worship to the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=107:3></a> He has only wanted the full sense of sonship to be known and of nearness to God in Christ.<a name=107:4></a> Now this is right and many fail in it, and have the feeling they can approach Christ, and trust in His love, but not God.<a name=107:5></a> The spirit of adoption is greatly wanting in many.<a name=107:6></a> When there was a man at Auburn in Maine (I forget his name) with whom I also had to do, and who opposed prayer and praise to the Lord Jesus, had also a correspondence with him to shew him he was wrong, but then both our efforts were useless.<a name=107:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is possible some may have objected to it really.<a name=107:8></a> If they will not worship a Man, the angels will, and moreover, every knee bow to Him, of men and infernal beings.<a name=107:9></a> While scripture puts us into the glory with Christ and like Christ, it carefully guards the personal glory and title of Christ.<a name=107:10></a> Moses and Elias were seen in the same glory as Christ, but the moment Peter would put them on a level, they disappear, and the Father's voice is heard declaring He was His beloved Son.<a name=107:11></a> The heavens were as open to Stephen (through Christ's death) as to Christ when He came up from Jordan; but Stephen looks at Him as an object, as Son of man, and is changed morally into His likeness: heaven looks down on Christ, and, instead of conforming Him to anything, the Spirit seals Him as He is, and the Father owns Him as He is.<a name=107:12></a> It is down here He says, "the Son of man who is in heaven.<a name=107:13></a>" It is He who came in in subjection by the door, the Shepherd who gave His life for the sheep, who says, "I and my Father are One.<a name=107:14></a>" If there is the divine and human nature in Him, there is only one Person.<a name=107:15></a> And he who says, I will not adore a man, is, to say the least, in danger of denying the unity of the Person.<a name=107:16></a> He who has seen Him has seen the Father.<a name=107:17></a> The Man who spoke to Philip and washed his feet, could say, and did at the same time, "Believest thou not that I am in the Father and the Father in me?<a name=107:18></a>" Stephen full of the Holy Ghost, addressed himself to the Son of man, saying, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.<a name=107:19></a>" Authority is given to Him to judge "because he is the <i>Son of man</i>;" but it is "that all men should honour the Son even as they honour the Father.<a name=107:20></a>" Is that refusing to worship Him?<a name=107:21></a> See John 5: 18; the Jews were more consistent.<a name=107:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To separate the Son of man and Son of God is to dissolve Christ.<a name=107:23></a> See John 3: 14, 16.<a name=107:24></a> See again, 1 John 5: 20, "We know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, in his Son <i>Jesus Christ</i>.<a name=107:25></a> This [He, outo"] is the true God and eternal life.<a name=107:26></a>" But Jesus is the name of Him who was born of the virgin Mary, and Christ is the anointed Man.<a name=107:27></a> And the apostle emphatically adds in contrast, "Little children, keep yourselves from idols.<a name=107:28></a>" There is a most striking passage in 1 John 2: 28 and 3: 1, 2.<a name=107:29></a> The inseparableness of personality and the distinction of nature is very striking -- "Before him at his coming," "is <i>born</i> of him" in verse 29, so that we are "sons of God" (3: 1), and yet the world "knew him not" -- "<i>sons of God</i>" (verse 2), but we <i>like Him</i> when <i>He</i> shall appear.<a name=107:30></a> All this blessed truth is lost if we dissolve, as I have called it, Christ.<a name=107:31></a> And yet I must know Him as a man: that is the distinctness of the nature, for He prayed to God and died, and yet He "was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death" -- when in the form of God, "made Himself of no reputation (eJauto;n ejkevnwsen), yet, being thus, could say, "Destroy this temple, and in three days <i>I</i> will raise it up.<a name=107:32></a>" "No man knoweth the Son but the Father.<a name=107:33></a>" But he who loses these things loses the Son.<a name=107:34></a> Speaking of worshipping a man is losing the Person of Christ.<a name=107:35></a> And if the angels are to worship Him [Hebrews 1: 6], worship is a just service as to what is -- for it is not our being exempt which is in question, but His being entitled to it.<a name=107:36></a> And there it is Christ, though His Godhead is brought out, yet as incarnate; for it is said, "when he had by himself purged our sins," and He is "the first begotten" (not the "only begotten"), and Psalm 2 is quoted where He is distinctly celebrated as Messiah -- Christ, or, as in English, 'His anointed.<a name=107:37></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I fear there has been too much discussion: refusing to worship the Lord is a very serious error, but discussion about His Person seldom leads to much fruit.<a name=107:38></a> I have spoken as plainly as possible, that there may be no mistake about my judgment of refusing to do it.<a name=107:39></a> But you or others may have wrongly estimated what Mr.<a name=107:40></a> -- wished to put forward.<a name=107:41></a> It is not only in replying to me, but in his controversy with the man at Auburn, that he rejected the thought of not worshipping the Lord -- to whom "every knee shall bow" (and that puts Him in the place of worship, as "have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal" shews).<a name=107:42></a> But his statement to me is quite clear.<a name=107:43></a> It is possible some, not inclined to worship Christ as is due, may have profited by expressions to support their false state of heart.<a name=107:44></a> Hasty conclusions are not always wise.<a name=107:45></a> Firmness against false doctrine is always right.<a name=107:46></a> But there are a great many who are in the Martha state -- "what thou askest of God," who, as not really free, cannot go directly to the Father, nor worship anybody rightly, and cannot worship under the conviction the Father Himself loveth them -- not questioning God's love in sending His only begotten Son, but who do not enter into the present privilege of direct address to the Father, as those who are in His presence and enjoy His love there -- loved as Jesus Himself is loved, wonderful as such a word is, this love being in them .<a name=107:47></a>.<a name=107:48></a>.<a name=107:49></a> .<a name=107:50></a>

		[Mr Slim] MY BELOVED BROTHER, -- It is time I wrote to you, and seek withal to cheer you also, for I hear that you have had trouble.<a name=110:1></a> My letter I had headed to begin some weeks ago, but only now could continue.<a name=110:2></a> I have not lost my interest in Barbados, nor in pour work, dear brother; but I have been incessantly occupied travelling and visiting the gatherings, besides claims in study work.<a name=110:3></a> I have been looking over the hymns for a new edition have my Testament on hand for a new edition, an English translation of my German to look over, am writing on John's gospel for the French, and on Romans for the Germans, and have been laid up in the gout to boot, not to say that I am within a few months of eighty; but enough of myself, only to excuse myself for my delay in writing.<a name=110:4></a> And now I must begin again for the third time, with the same excuse, having had two meetings, if not more, daily up to this (Edinburgh); besides the same work as far as possible while travelling, but Christ more precious than ever.<a name=110:5></a> I wonder sometimes how in sovereign grace God has revealed Him to me.<a name=110:6></a> I feel nearer, more at home in the Father's love, yet conscious of unworthiness, but more in the sense that all is pure grace.<a name=110:7></a> That there was no good in me I learnt, in one sense thoroughly, that is as a fact, some eight and fifty years ago, and I have, I hope, a deeper, clearer sense of it now, not seeing it, of course, as God does -- for who does?<a name=110:8></a> -- but at least with Him; but thus more in the sense of present, sovereign goodness in Him.<a name=110:9></a> And that is blessed, for that is what will be for ever, when no sin will remain and where sin can never enter; but that love is a sanctuary in which we walk while passing through a world of snares, "the provoking of all men .<a name=110:10></a>.<a name=110:11></a>.<a name=110:12></a> from the strife of tongues," and the more the crossing and entanglement of what is without, the sweeter the rest of His presence; and soon there will be nothing else, and even here He makes all things work together for good to them that love Him: but the rest is better, but the other leads to it even here.<a name=110:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are not at the end of our troubles here, at least locally for in the mass in the country they only need ministering Christ to them.<a name=110:14></a> And there is a great thirst for the word, so that a door of blessing is richly opened.<a name=110:15></a> But besides the positive evil in worldliness, a class had sprung up of true hearts, many of them, but where will, and, in some, pretension was at work, who, tired of the evil which I think they had not faith to meet, would have thrown, as we say in French, the handle after the axe, and cut the connection altogether, and set up afresh -- not tending exactly to make a new body, but that it was hopeless trying to go on.<a name=110:16></a> I had been deeply tried by this question before the evil broke out, but had concluded before God that it was not faith thus to leave, that "the hireling fleeth," and I stayed and served, though away in France from the London disturbances .<a name=110:17></a>.<a name=110:18></a>.<a name=110:19></a> .<a name=110:20></a> Where there has been faithfulness there is more life than before, sensibly so I think, and they are more closely united; but there is wanting a bond of general confidence which, I trust, may grow with time, and is growing; but there is still the feeling, and locally the effect, of the class I mentioned -- the last not large, but it tends to keep the sense of uneasiness alive.<a name=110:21></a> One has to have faith for everybody.<a name=110:22></a> Yet God is so good; for the work goes on with as much blessing as usual.<a name=110:23></a> Except in the locality referred to, a stranger would perceive little amiss, it is the general bond which is wanting: for one's work in testifying of Christ it is quite happy.<a name=110:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I thought you would like, dear brother, to know how things were here, and I have given you as plain and true an account as I could.<a name=110:25></a> Those who went wrong are disposed to make and represent all as bad as may be, but as to that I trust God.<a name=110:26></a> I have little uneasiness as to that.<a name=110:27></a> They feel I believe, when there is a little soundness, that God is not with them in it.<a name=110:28></a> I fear more what I believe is the unbelief of those who have felt and judged the evil, and with whom, as to that, I sympathise.<a name=110:29></a> The real truth is, God has been sifting us, but I believe in love, and when needed; and in that love I trust, and in this matter I never trusted anything else.<a name=110:30></a>

		Dear Ellen Walter, -- Christ has a priesthood which calls us above, Hebrews 7: 26.<a name=111:1></a> Such an one "became us," because we belong there; but a priesthood which can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, because we are down here.<a name=111:2></a> He enters into all these all knowing them, and so lays hold on our hearts, but to lead them up to higher and holier associations where God dwells.<a name=111:3></a> How gracious!<a name=111:4></a> There as an object we see Christ glorified, and are led on, for we are to be like Him and with Him.<a name=111:5></a> This gives energy to spiritual life.<a name=111:6></a> We look back to Him in humiliation, and this engages our affections and forms our heart and christian character -- gives us delight in His perfection -- "let the same mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus.<a name=111:7></a>" Thus feeding on Christ, and eating His flesh and drinking His blood, we abide in Him and He in us.<a name=111:8></a> The heart finds its food, its strength, its everything in Him, and our responsibility and the desire of our heart -- so that it is the law of liberty -- is to please Him, and walk as He walked, worthy of the Lord.<a name=111:9></a> What a calling!<a name=111:10></a> As He is so are we before God; as He walked so would we walk.<a name=111:11></a> Would that we could!<a name=111:12></a> In one sense we can, for His grace is sufficient for us; but we soon find, in looking at Him, how far we are behind.<a name=111:13></a> Cleave to Him.<a name=111:14></a> John 14: 19, 20.<a name=111:15></a><br>1880.<a name=111:16></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We ought to be a testimony for God down here, and we must surely remember this.<a name=114:9></a> "Ye are my witnesses," said Jehovah to Israel, and with still greater reason are Christians such, who are the salt of the earth, the light of the world.<a name=114:10></a> I seek this, I pray God for it, and also that He may maintain His testimony in its purity I believe He will, but for that we must live near Him in spirit, as He lived by His Father, one with Him, in such a way that all He said and did was but the expression of what the Father was.<a name=114:11></a> It is what we ought to be for Christ but for that the heart must be with Him above.<a name=114:12></a> The first thing is communion with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ, for there the direct power of the life is.<a name=114:13></a> But it is a mistake to suppose that the heavenly things are not revealed to us: "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.<a name=114:14></a> But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit.<a name=114:15></a> We have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we may know the things that are freely given to us of God.<a name=114:16></a>" Now, whilst giving us strength down here, and detaching us from the things that are seen, this accustoms us to live in the things that are our eternal portion.<a name=114:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We often make use of the Saviour in His grace, so suited to our need, and that flows so freely towards us -- who thinks of us, of all our difficulties, of all our weaknesses -- and we are quite right, for He makes us pass in peace and safety through a world of sorrow and danger; but it is another thing to have the heart lifted up above the world, whilst passing through it and attached to Him in heaven in such a way that that which fills the heart now is also the object of our hope.<a name=114:18></a> It is what I seek, and pray to God for, for other Christians as for myself.<a name=114:19></a> But we must have Christ for the journey through the wilderness; we need to know how to count on His faithfulness in all circumstances, and to wait on Him.<a name=114:20></a>

		May God keep all the brethren very near to Him, this is our eternal position, and it keeps the conscience awake.<a name=114:21></a> "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.<a name=114:22></a>''<br>1880.<a name=114:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		MY DEAR H J Jull, -- You know nothing of my relationship with Abbot's Hill, nor what I have said or written to them, but that is not the question now, but the position you have definitively taken .<a name=115:6></a>.<a name=115:7></a>.<a name=115:8></a> .<a name=115:9></a>

		You now openly judge the whole body of brethren as unfit to be associated with, on account of their state, while reserving to yourself the right to select certain assemblies and individuals whom you will own.<a name=115:10></a> You and this party are characterised by that holiness and truth which are proper to the precious testimony which God confided to brethren, at least by the love of it and fidelity to it; the rest are in a mass regarded as unworthy.<a name=115:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I have not seen that those who pretend to this, are more holy or characterised more by what is proper to this testimony, nor more devoted, nor have the good of the church of God at heart.<a name=115:12></a> Their state does not approve itself to my spiritual judgment, while owning many of those I refer to as dear brethren.<a name=115:13></a> I know among the thousands of whom you know nothing, brethren walking in obscurity, more devoted, more given up to Christ, than those who are disposed thus pretentiously to quit them.<a name=115:14></a> You admit the precious testimony of God was confided to brethren, so that it is solely on the ground of their unfaithfulness and your greater faithfulness that you leave them.<a name=115:15></a> Now I admit that brethren have declined from the unworldliness which was proper to this testimony, and have borne as God enabled me a testimony to this effect, and the troubles in London have largely awakened conscience, and I may add, I never met in visiting, so great an appetite for the word.<a name=115:16></a> But all this was fully before me, before -- 's case arose.<a name=115:17></a> I weighed before God, with deeper anxiety than I can speak of here, the question of leaving brethren, and what I should do.<a name=115:18></a> I felt clearly it was not faith -- "the hireling fleeth" -- and I remained where I was, though in some things more isolated.<a name=115:19></a> I have not remarked that those who have taken the ground you do have advanced in holiness and spirituality, rather the contrary, and I am satisfied it is the path of pretension, not of faith.<a name=115:20></a> The question was fully before me, and decided before any of the particular questions arose, though partially occasioned by what brought some of them in result.<a name=115:21></a> I therefore, having had the matter fully before me, reject as evil the ground you have taken.<a name=115:22></a> Were the movement of those you join yourself to, to break up brethren -- and I have thought of all that -- your party, were I to be with any (which I do not think I should) would, I think, be the very last I should be with: indeed, I should not think of it at all, it is too pretentious for me.<a name=115:23></a> I have felt that brethren had got into a low state, and have felt the path was to serve them in it.<a name=115:24></a> You have judged that they are in a hopeless, irremediable state, and judged of God to be unworthy of His testimony.<a name=115:25></a> God will judge whom He accepts in this.<a name=115:26></a> If God has not so judged them, you are clearly wrong.<a name=115:27></a> I shall not regret, if He does reject them, having sought to serve them, and Him, in their low estate.<a name=115:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I enter into no details as to -- .<a name=115:29></a> It is not the question.<a name=115:30></a> Your statement is, 'I am not free to be in their association, as feeling my great responsibility to the Lord and to the brethren.<a name=115:31></a>' I believe that under the influence of an evil system you have not been able to resist the effect of the pressure of A.<a name=115:32></a> H.<a name=115:33></a>, and what was associated with it.<a name=115:34></a> You cannot be surprised if I act as to you on your own statement, and at the same time reject in every way the system under whose influence you are.<a name=115:35></a> I reserve to myself, as it concerns many besides you, the right to communicate this letter in any way I think proper.<a name=115:36></a> I leave the judgment of the question, and of the right path, entirely in the Lord's hands.<a name=115:37></a>

		[Cumnock Brethren] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I trust that it is error,<a href="#117:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> and not heresy.<a name=117:1></a> For the latter there must be the evil will of the flesh; and I trust that this is not the case with our brother.<a name=117:2></a> Another thing it is right to add, that it is always right to hear what a person has to say before condemning him.<a name=117:3></a> But taking your account of the matter and question, it is quite clear that there must be faith in the word in order to be born again.<a name=117:4></a> That we are begotten, and born, by the word is plainly stated in scripture; and the word is received by faith.<a name=117:5></a> A word not believed has no effect at all.<a name=117:6></a> A person may see men as trees walking, that is true; still the word has been believed.<a name=117:7></a> I believe that the source of the teaching is taking up a doctrine in the mind; and, lowliness failing -- it is not experimentally realised, but the mind trusted -- things are put out which are not really of faith.<a name=117:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not think the passage in Matthew 13 as to the good soil, applies at all.<a name=117:9></a> In every case, save the first, the seed sprang up and grew: the object of the parable is quite another.<a name=117:10></a> I should not, on the other hand, use for it (though I do not doubt I have often done it, from not examining it closely), Galatians 3: "We are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus," because it ought to be "sons," not "children.<a name=117:11></a>" And this, which is christian standing, is contrasted in Galatians iv.<a name=117:12></a> with those who were quickened, and heirs of all, but not in the position of sons; that is, believers under the law.<a name=117:13></a> The origin of the error I believe to be a hasty and immature taking up of the difference between being quickened and set free.<a name=117:14></a> That people must believe the word to be quickened I have no doubt of; but a person may believe in Christ, and not know the value of the work of Christ so as to have peace and forgiveness.<a name=117:15></a> Thus the prodigal referred to was brought to know he was perishing, confessed his sins, and set out to his father, and that was the work of grace in him, but said, "Make me a hired servant.<a name=117:16></a>" That was not knowing his father; nor had he the best robe on him so as to be fit to go as son into the house.<a name=117:17></a> When his father was on his neck he does not say, 'Make me a servant'; and, indeed, we hear no more of him but of what his father was to him and did for him.<a name=117:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have no doubt that He who begins the good work will perfect it unto the day of Jesus Christ; but the work of the Spirit and word, by which we are converted, born again, through faith, is distinct from that knowledge of the work of Christ in the conscience which gives peace, and there <i>may</i> be an interval passed between them; but my heart being repentant and turned to God, is a distinct thing from having the Father on my neck and the best robe upon me.<a name=117:19></a> In Acts 2 they believed, through grace, Peter's word and said, "Men and brethren, what shall we do.<a name=117:20></a> Peter <i>then</i> presents to them the forgiveness of sins and the reception of the Holy Ghost.<a name=117:21></a> Here there was no delay but there were two distinct things; and, from want of a plain gospel, souls often stay some time in Romans 7, converted (by the word), but without peace, much more, without deliverance -- nay, are taught to stay there.<a name=117:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My impression (for, I repeat, it is always fair to hear what a person has to say) is, that what has been taught is the fruit of being aware of this difference, and the mind, having had too much confidence in itself, teaching what was not experimentally learned, and hence immaturely and with mistakes which might be mischievous -- perhaps, dear brother, with a little dogmatic impatience on your part, there being behind truth which you had not learned.<a name=117:23></a> But in this case it would be error, not heresy; only the teacher would have to be more a learner, and not to go beyond what he had learned <i>with God</i> I have spoken openly, having confidence in his and your love as brethren, though personally I have not the pleasure of knowing you.<a name=117:24></a>

		Dear W Moore, -- I did not like the article<a href="#118:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> by -- at all, and sent him word so.<a name=118:1></a> But there is great general decline on this point, and I have a tract in hand as to it, which I hope to get out as soon as possible.<a name=118:2></a><a href="#118:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a> We must not confound manifested salvation, and being born of God.<a name=118:3></a> We read, "To give knowledge of salvation to his people by the remission of their sins.<a name=118:4></a>" But before Christ came, souls were born of God; but they could not believe that Jesus was the Christ, for He had not come.<a name=118:5></a> They might have believed the promises then which referred to Him who should come: "But life and incorruptibility have been brought to light by the gospel.<a name=118:6></a>" I can now say, "Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God.<a name=118:7></a>" But that is not exactly saying, Whosoever does not, is not.<a name=118:8></a> We can say, he that, when He is presented, rejects Him is condemned, dies in his sins, and a saving work may be begun in the soul by the Spirit of God where the soul is not clear as to the Person of Christ, but which assuredly leads to it, and which, now that His name is spread abroad, it is almost impossible to separate from it; nor can we ever say that a man has life till he believes in Christ.<a name=118:9></a> Still this remains always true and fundamental, "He that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life"; and repentance and remission of sins were to be preached in His name.<a name=118:10></a> Conscience and knowledge may be both there without a quickening work.<a name=118:11></a> But there may be a work in consciences in the living power of the Spirit, before the mind is clear as to the truth concerning the Lord, yet ultimately the testing-point; and, the fact of Jesus Christ being the Son of God and dying for us being universally known, it is implicitly believed without the passage to real faith being perceived.<a name=118:12></a> We see love to the brethren, love to the word, and we cannot help trusting the work of the Spirit is there, and there is the current faith in Christ with us, as I have said -- the change into reality unperceived.<a name=118:13></a> But all this refers to our perception of it, not to the reality of the thing in God's sight.<a name=118:14></a> But "of his own will begat he us by the word of truth," and that truth is concerning His Son.<a name=118:15></a> We may see the fruits, and so judge or trust that life is there; but the root is not in the fruits.<a name=118:16></a>

		It does not follow that a person is clear as to the efficacy of Christ's work, because he believes in, and loves, Christ.<a name=118:17></a> The sealing of the Spirit goes, as to the detail of the work, I believe, with faith in the work, as well as the Person.<a name=118:18></a> See Acts 2: 37, 38, and 10: 43; Ephesians 1: 13.<a name=118:19></a> But in a plain gospel they go together.<a name=118:20></a> Being in the flesh is being in the standing of the first Adam before God, and not in Christ -- judging from ourselves to God's judgment, and not from His work to our place before Him: "According to this time shall it be said of Jacob and of Israel what hath God wrought?<a name=118:21></a>" So the prodigal.<a name=118:22></a> "In the flesh" (Romans 7 and 8) is the same.<a name=118:23></a> Deliverance and forgiveness are not the same thing.<a name=118:24></a> We must learn what we are, as well as what we have done; deliverance is known by sealing, as being in Christ.<a name=118:25></a> "Where the Spirit of the Lord is there is liberty.<a name=118:26></a>"

		-- - A question was communicated to me by -- 'What would be sufficient to deprive the assembly of the testimony of God?<a name=120:1></a>' Now the question is, to my mind, a profound mistake -- that the testimony they bear is the governing object of the mind of saints.<a name=120:2></a> It is no new thought to me, but what I have insisted on, I know not how long (some thirty or forty years), that wherever an assembly, or the assembly, are such to bear a testimony, they will be a testimony to their own weakness and inefficiency; because the object of their walk cannot be one which efficiently forms a Christian.<a name=120:3></a> When they have a right one, they will be a testimony; but to be one is never the first object.<a name=120:4></a> To have Christ, I mean practically to walk with Him and after Him, to have communion with the Father and the Son, to walk in unfeigned obedience and lowliness, to live in realised dependence on Christ and have His secret with us and realise the Father's love, to have our affections set on things above, to walk in patience and yet confidence through this world -- this is what we have to seek, and if we realise it we shall be a testimony, whether individually or collectively, but in possessing the things themselves, and they form us through grace, so that we are one: but seeking or getting up to be it does not.<a name=120:5></a> Moses did not seek to have his face shine, nor even know when it did, but when he had been with God it did so.<a name=120:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Wherever Christians, so far as I have seen, set up to be a testimony, they get full of themselves, and lose the sense that they are so, and fancy it is having much of Christ.<a name=120:7></a> A shining face never sees itself.<a name=120:8></a> The true heart is occupied with Christ, and in a certain sense and measure self is gone.<a name=120:9></a> The right thought is not to think of self at all, save as we have to judge it.<a name=120:10></a> You cannot think of being a testimony save of your being so, and that is thinking of self -- and, as I have said before, it is what I have always seen to be the case.<a name=120:11></a>

		[J R Field] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- One of the first signs to me of the evil current as to that point was the Manchester meeting.<a name=121:1></a> Brethren were thinking and speaking of themselves, not of Christ.<a name=121:2></a> Setting up to be Philadelphia was being of the spirit of Laodicea, as indeed I have often said: I have trusted that God was working towards that, but setting up to be something was the very opposite to that work.<a name=121:3></a> Philadelphia is never gone till Christ comes -- has the promise, because she has kept the word of Christ's patience, to be kept from the hour of temptation which is coming on all the earth, and the promise that Christ is coming quickly.<a name=121:4></a> I trust that there will be a much more decided Philadelphian testimony.<a name=121:5></a> That is not what I quarrel with, but the corporate pretension to be it now.<a name=121:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next thing I object to is making those who open when the Lord knocks, specially excellent Christians who are in this spiritually advanced state.<a name=121:7></a> I see nothing of the kind.<a name=121:8></a> They are unconverted or professing to be Christians, in so low a state, that all is going to be spued out of Christ's mouth, and they are warned to get Christ and what is real.<a name=121:9></a> There is not a word of their coming out and being in testimony; Christ goes in and sups with them.<a name=121:10></a> But so far from thinking the promise the highest, I have <i>always</i> thought it the lowest.<a name=121:11></a> It is merely reigning -- a wonderful thing, no doubt, for such as we, but what Old Testament saints will have too.<a name=121:12></a> It is the external glory, not being inside the house.<a name=121:13></a> The exhortation is to get what is real from Christ instead of their empty pretension, "that the <i>shame of thy nakedness</i> do not appear," and get their eyes anointed that they may see.<a name=121:14></a> I see nothing of extraordinary advance in spirituality here -- a most salutary warning in the present state of things, but nothing extraordinarily spiritual, nor any call into a special place of testimony at all.<a name=121:15></a> The whole thing seems to me a delusion.<a name=121:16></a> Philadelphia is praised because they have not <i>denied</i> Christ's name.<a name=121:17></a> They have a little strength: that does not sound very exalted; but to be faithful and keep Christ's word when others are giving up the faith, may be the test of theirs.<a name=121:18></a> I desire earnestly to see the beloved saints roused to entire devotedness and strength and constancy of communion; but it is not pretension to be something which characterises this.<a name=121:19></a>

		You say both go on to the end [Revelation 3]: how, then, can Philadelphia be gone?<a name=121:29></a> I do not at all object to judging our state, provided it be conscience, not murmuring.<a name=121:30></a> It has gained much latterly, through grace; but the earnest desire of more of Christ dwelling in our hearts, I go heartily with.<a name=121:31></a> But that is not pretending to be something, and an inflation which does not come from God .<a name=121:32></a>.<a name=121:33></a>.<a name=121:34></a> .<a name=121:35></a>

		[Mr Storey] DEAREST BROTHER, -- I was very glad to hear from you and of the saints, I do not find absence enfeebles my interest in them.<a name=125:9></a> I should greatly like to see them all again, but having now entered my eighty-first year I can hardly look to long journeys and active labours as once undertaken, but ever to Him who, with no journeys to take, ever watches over and visits them in an unceasing and tender care -- a heart that never grows weary, and strength that never decays.<a name=125:10></a> I am fresh through grace, and Christ gives me renewed strength still to work on.<a name=125:11></a> I have had these last few days three meetings a day, and scarcely less than two for a long time, having been round visiting the saints up to the North of England and Scotland.<a name=125:12></a> Thank God, I found the brethren generally happy and much appetite for the word; and others labouring about give the same testimony, and in several places there is a good deal of conversion.<a name=125:13></a> You will have heard there has been trouble in London which has been really largely blessed .<a name=125:14></a>.<a name=125:15></a>.<a name=125:16></a> .<a name=125:17></a> Not that all are clear, but the general state of the work encourages those who are engaged in it, and any evil is sinking down in its littleness.<a name=125:18></a> Our conference meetings too have been much blessed.<a name=125:19></a> But I do not doubt and have not doubted there had been decline in spirituality and devotedness; and God in His rich mercy gave them a good shake, but it has roused and blessed them.<a name=125:20></a> There is far more conscience and reference of heart to God than there was.<a name=125:21></a> For myself it deeply tried me, though I had little personally to say to it, which my being in France helped me in, but I never enjoyed the Lord's love, and learned what His word reveals to us, and its power, as I have in these times; and I have felt how good it is to trust Him who never fails.<a name=125:22></a>

		God makes a difference between mistakes in judgment, and positive wrongness of state.<a name=125:23></a> There is a government of God: where there is integrity of heart, He may chastise us because of it for blessing: there is always in such case want of waiting upon Him.<a name=125:24></a> But while He may exercise our patience by the other, it will sink out of the place of testimony.<a name=125:25></a> Chastening is good for us -- we seldom wait sufficiently on God.<a name=125:26></a> He goes on straight in His way to the end of purposed blessing, while the petty ways of man cross each other in a thousand directions and where only men come to nothing: where the Lord is at bottom the motive, He leads us into His straight way in the end -- so faithful, so patient in goodness.<a name=125:27></a> The Lord give us to have Himself always before us -- the eye on Him, the heart looking for Him, who shall receive us to Himself, and have nothing imperfect.<a name=125:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Redemption is perfect, absolute: when first known, in itself a source of boundless joy and triumph, and at the end of our course, when more or less we may accuse ourselves of failure (Deuteronomy 9), gives as to acceptance God's judgment, "What hath God wrought," said of Jacob and Israel.<a name=125:29></a> (Numbers 23) All that is a work finished and done, and Christ sitting down because it is.<a name=125:30></a> But it brings us generally into the wilderness (not as imperfect, for the thief could go straight to Paradise), and that is not a finished work, but what we go through and which tests us, but in which where life is, God helps us by His power: we learn what we are, but we learn what the Lord is -- it is constant dependence or failure, but constant faithfulness to sustain us.<a name=125:31></a> But here we go through exercises which humble and prove us (Deuteronomy 8), but learn much to do us good in our latter end.<a name=125:32></a> We have the priesthood to help, the red heifer and running water to cleanse for communion, and at the end return to what I have quoted -- Numbers 23; but we must learn it along the way.<a name=125:33></a> The redemption is never unsettled.<a name=125:34></a> Put Deuteronomy 9 and Numbers 23 together, and much is learnt, but it must be experimentally learned with God on the way.<a name=125:35></a>

		[P A Humphrey] MY DEAR BROTHER.<a name=128:1></a>, -- The idea that ceasing to break bread a Sunday, or even two, dissolves the assembly, seems to me without any ground whatever.<a name=128:2></a> An assembly may not break bread out of the fear of God, by reason of trouble and confusion at the time through a perverse individual (and I have known such a case), without a thought of dissolving itself, but because it was a faithful assembly and feared God.<a name=128:3></a> Why, a persecuting police or violent man might come in and hinder them breaking bread!<a name=128:4></a> If it must be by the will of the assembly, it must be a will to dissolve itself.<a name=128:5></a> I trust the Lord will put an end to the confusion at -- and I believe He will.<a name=128:6></a> What is needed in such cases generally is restoring souls, not the outward state of things.<a name=128:7></a> There is an interference often of brethren from a distance which is not of God, and dulls the conscience of the assembly.<a name=128:8></a> I do not deny they may be useful if coming to serve and awake the conscience of the assembly itself.<a name=128:9></a> Its own folly may dissolve an assembly as a fact.<a name=128:10></a>

		[Mr Pinkerton] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- It is a good while now since I exchanged a line with you; and, in fact, I have been laid up, so that I could do, for some time, little or nothing -- entirely down, so that I did not know whether I should be raised up at all again.<a name=130:12></a> It is now near three months that I have been unable to pass the night stretched in my bed -- at first, not at all: now I sit up in bed about a third of the night, but I sleep rather better then, than lying down -- all this of the poor body, but it makes its being left, if not glorified, nearer to us.<a name=130:13></a> God may give higher apprehensions of the joys before us, and if all be not habitually and honestly purged before God there may be exercises of conscience, even if we know the remedy.<a name=130:14></a> I hardly came so near to going away as that; but I was surprised, in at least looking it in the face, how little difference there was: Christ with me for the way, and Christ at the end for full and perfect joy.<a name=130:15></a> It is a difference to go.<a name=130:16></a> It is what is eternal, but we live as in Christ in what is eternal; but faith is not sight.<a name=130:17></a> But the word is ever precious, which brings what is of God, and God Himself to us, in the power of His own Spirit, and so as from Himself, and this gives it a peculiar and blessed character: soon it will be better still; not from Himself, but Himself.<a name=130:18></a> But it is suited to us here, just like Christ Himself -- what is of God and heavenly, but suited to us here -- with a divine flexibility which suits itself to all circumstances and to everything that is in our hearts, but to take us up whence it comes from.<a name=130:19></a>

		I have written a tract on the "Sealing of the Spirit.<a name=130:20></a>" I felt its being muddied, as it was, a good deal, and this was the case everywhere; it was a sign of the state of souls.<a name=130:21></a> But dear -- was never, I think, clear; I have often told him so, never really out of Romans 7.<a name=130:22></a> But how many are there!<a name=130:23></a> Yes, very many take for granted they are out of it, while full, perfect, simple redemption is not really known.<a name=130:24></a> Ask, not in Palestine, but in Boston and New York, what it is to have "no more conscience of sins," and they cannot tell; and then God for us is not known.<a name=130:25></a> This side in the public teaching was wanting at the Reformation.<a name=130:26></a> They saw Christ's work meeting our need before God, but "God so loved" was hardly a part of their gospel.<a name=130:27></a> On assurance they largely insisted; indeed, justifying faith was, to them, the personal appropriation of Christ's work in an assuring way: it was not sufficiently the object of faith, though it was there, but the state of the soul.<a name=130:28></a> But when it pleases God to do so, He works with very imperfect truth, provided it be Christ; it is one of the present difficulties.<a name=130:29></a> At the first, full truth flowed from the centre and drew souls up to it; now it works where all is confusion, to bring in divine order and faith through the word -- I mean order as to the truth, But I close.<a name=130:30></a>

		[From the French.<a name=131:1></a>] -- - The word "friend" has a double meaning: my friend is a man to whom I can open my heart, and also a man who is kind and friendly towards me; but the term always implies a certain intimacy.<a name=131:2></a> The Jews called the Lord "a friend of sinners," and truly He was so.<a name=131:3></a> He called His disciples His friends because He had communicated to them all that the Father had given Him.<a name=131:4></a> Any familiarity with the Lord, such as one finds among the Moravians, impresses me painfully, and I consider it carnal, even when it is linked with piety.<a name=131:5></a> "He is not ashamed, to call us brethren.<a name=131:6></a>" In this last sense, it is quite improper to apply this word to Jesus, and to call Him our Brother.<a name=131:7></a> In the instances which you quote, I think the style is too familiar.<a name=131:8></a> But if we say, 'What a wondrous Friend of sinners Jesus was when He gave Himself upon the cross!<a name=131:9></a>' or, 'What a Friend to His own is that Jesus who ever lives to intercede for us!<a name=131:10></a>' -- the thought assumes quite another character.<a name=131:11></a> But we must avoid a freedom which is not becoming.<a name=131:12></a>

		It was the almost universal opinion of early Christians that Genesis 6: 2 applied to fallen, or rather to the fall of the angels (in this case different from Satan); and Jude 6, 7 seems to confirm it -- compare 2 Peter 2: 4 more generally.<a name=133:5></a> But if it be so, God has shut them up in chains of darkness, and hidden the whole scene and its fruits from our sight in overwhelming waters of the deluge; and it is a mercy that He has.<a name=133:6></a>

		Baptising for the dead (1 Corinthians 15: 29) is, I believe, the nature and meaning of baptism.<a name=133:7></a> Alive in flesh, we as a figure take our part in Christ's death; only it is put in a general way, and the force of it -- what is the good of taking a place in death if there be no resurrection?<a name=133:8></a> If you take verses 20-28 as a parenthesis, the verses connect directly: verse 29 answers to 18, and 30-32 to 19.<a name=133:9></a> This renders the intelligence of it easier.<a name=133:10></a>

		As to Daniel, Christ was cut off and took nothing (see margin -- the real sense did not take the kingdom then), after sixty and two weeks, that is sixty-nine.<a name=133:11></a> Now we learn from the gospels His ministry was as nearly as possible three years and a half, so that for intelligent faith there is only half a week left, and, in fact, only that of the great tribulation.<a name=133:12></a> For unbelief -- the beast and the apostate Jews -- there is a week, and they enter into covenant for this time, but he breaks it when half through, takes away the sacrifice, and the great tribulation begins -- that which is spoken of in Matthew 24 after verse 15, and in Mark 13 -- and this only in the Revelation.<a name=133:13></a>

		[G Dennet (E Dennett?<a name=135:1></a>)] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I do not like the pages<a href="#135:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> you sent me, because they perplex the mind as to what it needs as fundamental truth.<a name=135:2></a> The first passage might pass, because the last words save it.<a name=135:3></a> But the first two lines state boldly that God does not need to be propitiated, and the second line of page 246 throws all into confusion.<a name=135:4></a> 'To be propitiated on their behalf He never needed,' yet propitiation was requisite.<a name=135:5></a> Now this confounds two senses of 'propitiate': the disposing to kindness, and meeting justice about sins.<a name=135:6></a> Yet it was 'an act Godward,' and propitiation was needed; yet 'God needed not to be propitiated.<a name=135:7></a>' This confuses and mixes up the two senses of the word, and indeed the characters of God, as judge and as love.<a name=135:8></a> Now as regards reconciliation, I recognise fully God did not need to be influenced to be gracious towards us.<a name=135:9></a> In John 3 His love is stated as the ground on which the gift came, by which propitiation could be made.<a name=135:10></a> The outgoing of the love of God was the free spontaneous actings of His own grace and nature.<a name=135:11></a> This was wanting in the theology of the Reformation and their creeds.<a name=135:12></a> They had, "the Son of man must be lifted up," and believed in its efficacy; but they had not, "for God so loved" etc.<a name=135:13></a> Christ on the cross had satisfied for believers the justice of God, but God still retained the character of a judge.<a name=135:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The mistake is, confounding the character of judge and sovereign love, which is above all causes and relations.<a name=135:15></a> God is a righteous judge; righteousness is a real thing, and God is righteous, a righteous Lord, and requires righteousness.<a name=135:16></a> He is not said to be righteousness, but righteous, because it is a relative term; no more than we are called to be love, because it is free and supreme.<a name=135:17></a> Now love brought down God to deliver Israel.<a name=135:18></a> But the God who delivered them was a righteous God, "of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity.<a name=135:19></a>" He passed through Egypt to smite; and blood, the blood of the lamb, had to be presented to His eye, or He must have smitten Israel.<a name=135:20></a> He judged being what He was, according to that which met Him, righteous judgment, and passed over because the blood was there.<a name=135:21></a> It was a righteous estimate of the value of what God saw.<a name=135:22></a> "The Son of man must be lifted up", and this should have all its value: to reveal God's love and all its manifold consequences, according to the counsels of God, it needed to be the Son of His love.<a name=135:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I read, 'It is not the meeting of the sinner's need, though that results from it, but the providing that God should be able to act in grace.<a name=135:24></a>' This supposes that God's activity is only in grace, and that judgment is only a casualty.<a name=135:25></a> But this, save as to activity, is false.<a name=135:26></a> There exist relationships to which responsibility is attached, and these must be met.<a name=135:27></a> There is right and wrong, which bring in judgment, besides grace.<a name=135:28></a> Of these the express measure, as to man, is law; nor would grace exist but for this, though love would.<a name=135:29></a> When men have failed, righteous judgment ensues, the receiving of the things done in the body.<a name=135:30></a> And in bearing our sins in His own body on the tree, Christ directly and intentionally met our need -- this as regards us; but as a general principle, He gave Himself a ransom for all, gave Himself to meet the need as an ajntivlutron.<a name=135:31></a> This giving Himself was pure, unbounded love, but it was to meet a need.<a name=135:32></a> The blood on the lintel and doorposts was the effect of divine love, but it was to meet a need.<a name=135:33></a> Responsibility and its consequences are forgotten in the statements; and the requirements of God's nature founded on it lost, as if there was nothing but the activity of love which had to be kept pure in God, according to some unknown standard and exigency.<a name=135:34></a> The love is free and sovereign, but the righteousness and righteous requirement is true and unchangeable: "The Son of man must be lifted up.<a name=135:35></a>" The existence of conscience is the now innate sense of this.<a name=135:36></a> And obligation to God is in these pages set aside or forgotten, in insisting on the love of God.<a name=135:37></a> There is a vast deal more: the doctrine of God's righteousness for man when man had none, and the wonderful counsels of God in which grace reigns through righteousness, so that righteousness is itself the fruit of love, and a far, far wider range of thought behind, on which I do not touch, confining myself to the questions you have sent me.<a name=135:38></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Reconciling God is not scriptural, and it seems to me unworthy of God -- [supposing] some being, superior Being in love, who is so to dispose Him.<a name=135:39></a> I add, the words are confounded in A.<a name=135:40></a>V.<a name=135:41></a> Romans 5: 11: "atonement" should be "reconciliation": and Hebrews 2: 17, "to make reconciliation" should be "propitiation," where the need is clearly expressed: compare chapter 1: 3.<a name=135:42></a>

		Dearest G Glenny, -- Your letter was not answered, because, first, I was so low, I could do next to nothing; and then it got astray, when I could take care of nothing; and it hung ever on my mind as a thing to do, and I was very glad to get yours today.<a name=137:1></a>

		I may comfort you concerning England, for as a general rule the gatherings are in a far better state than they were before the trouble, and there is more conscience.<a name=137:2></a> I do not doubt much is yet to be desired, but there is more spring, too, in work, and everywhere a great desire for the word.<a name=137:3></a> The difficulties found faith very low; and a mass had come in as they would to any other sect with little or no principle, and what occurred found them in this state of weakness.<a name=137:4></a> Then there was a revival baptist work, which, while it sought to be accredited by brethrenism, had none of the principles which had formed them .<a name=137:5></a>.<a name=137:6></a>.<a name=137:7></a> .<a name=137:8></a>

		A collateral difficulty arose, that a large number of godly brethren were so disgusted with the duplicity and want of uprightness that they were disposed to leave, and so get clear of it.<a name=137:9></a> This was perhaps the most trying part of it, having to oppose men you loved and valued; but, dear brother, the Lord is sufficient for everything.<a name=137:10></a> The last difficulty is gone, and the upright ones more cordially united than ever .<a name=137:11></a>.<a name=137:12></a>.<a name=137:13></a> .<a name=137:14></a> But the mass of brethren are sound, and going on, not occupied with all this, and because they are quiet they pass unnoticed.<a name=137:15></a> Occasionally there is a local effort which troubles them, but it is left to God; and if a few who stand in the gap are firm, then all go on peacefully and happily .<a name=137:16></a>.<a name=137:17></a>.<a name=137:18></a> .<a name=137:19></a>

		We have to go through a world full of experiences, and christian life in it thus, with which as ministering we have to do.<a name=140:9></a> Our great affair is so in our own souls to have Christ formed in us, and so to know Him experimentally in the little world of our own souls, that all that is of self being judged, then only Christ may come out, whether as testimony of life in the big outer world, or in that which we apply to others in ministry; and to wait on Him so that we may be guided in doing it.<a name=140:10></a> I often find the question arise in my mind in service, whether I was enough in the spirit of unitedness -- that is, with Christ -- the sense of His presence -- so as to have had the right thing come into my mind: for "a word spoken in due season, how good is it!<a name=140:11></a>" At least we must seek this, and be continually looking to Him so that there may be nothing hasty in our words.<a name=140:12></a> I have no doubt that if we kept close to Christ, His Spirit would guide us in our intercourse with others.<a name=140:13></a> We are not always conscious of divine guidance, even when it is there; but the word comes from Christ to the souls we have to say to, even if rejected -- as we see with the Jews.<a name=140:14></a> But our part is to keep close to Christ, so that it should be "not I, but Christ liveth in me," and thus He acts in our thoughts and ways without our, at the moment, thinking of Him directly; but we always have the consciousness of speaking for Him, and of His presence.<a name=140:15></a> "Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt," "which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace to the hearers.<a name=140:16></a>"

		-- - My impression,<a href="#142:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> for it is not the result of theological examination, is that the Lord God speaks of Christ's mission as a whole from the time it was said (if time it can be called) "a body hast thou prepared me" till the service was accomplished He sent that blessed Person with the whole scene before Him into the world; but the actual sending, down here when a man in the world, was from the Holy Ghost coming upon Him when He returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee.<a name=142:1></a> With quite another object in view the two steps are in Philippians 2, "emptied himself," and, being a man, "humbled himself.<a name=142:2></a>" So God prepared a body for Him (dug ears for Him); and then, though Son all the while as when twelve years of age, He was sent out as man set apart to bear the witness He was sent for.<a name=142:3></a> God had created the world by Him, He will judge the world by Him.<a name=142:4></a> But here He is looked at as sent into the world for service; and His whole Person, Son of God and man, is in view as one whole in service.<a name=142:5></a> He took the form of a servant; "Lo, I come to do thy will.<a name=142:6></a>" The sanctifying was the appropriating -- setting apart -- this Person to the humble, in one sense, but glorious service which Christ performed, though service He never gives up.<a name=142:7></a> The Father get apart this Person for this service -- did so in preparing a body -- did so in incarnation, and did so in anointing and sealing when the opportune time was come.<a name=142:8></a> He was sent into the world, so actually set apart (in divine purpose in Psalm 40) for the service, the Word made flesh and dwelling among us, and then as Man by the Holy Ghost coming and abiding on Him.<a name=142:9></a> He could not be sent before He was set apart for it but while actually set apart in Matthew 3, 4, He could not have been actually then if not in God's mind and by incarnation before.<a name=142:10></a><br>[1881.<a name=142:11></a>]

		[D Lithgow] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- Thank you for your account.<a name=143:1></a> I cannot but think God is bringing things to light.<a name=143:2></a> I trust and pray that God may guide the brethren at -- .<a name=143:3></a> Waiting upon Him, He surely will.<a name=143:4></a> Christ never ceases to care for the church.<a name=143:5></a> He may see good to try us, but He is a match for any mischief-maker.<a name=143:6></a> But I write properly for two points: First, that I do trust our dear brother will do nothing whatever, but cast it all on the Lord; He will take care of it: I know that.<a name=143:7></a> The other is, that unanimity is nonsense, a denial of the power and operation of the Spirit, and clean contrary to the word of God.<a name=143:8></a> First, it is nonsense; because till the case is decided the person charged is one of the assembly, and you are not going to make him agree as led by the Spirit in judging his own case.<a name=143:9></a> If you do not allow him, you have put him out before his case is decided.<a name=143:10></a> It is real nonsense.<a name=143:11></a> Waiting for quiet godly men who doubt is all right unanimity is so many men agreeing.<a name=143:12></a> The world must go on and so judges by a majority, but for the saints nothing can be done unless all agree -- this is man, not the Spirit of God.<a name=143:13></a> Supposing it was a flagrant case of stealing or adultery?<a name=143:14></a> Are you to wait till he agrees to put himself out?<a name=143:15></a> Again, supposing the person or persons are obstinate, self-willed, evil walkers?<a name=143:16></a> The assembly must, in either case, go on with wickedness, with what God judges in its midst, till the guilty think proper to judge themselves, or break up altogether.<a name=143:17></a> It is denying the operation of God's Spirit in the assembly's clearing itself: better not to have any discipline at all.<a name=143:18></a>

		[Mr Pinkerton], First, Ephesians 2 is not experimental, but that absolute work of grace which has taken us, when dead in sins, and put us into Christ in heavenly places; as it took Christ dead as man for our sins, and put Him into glory.<a name=147:1></a> Romans 6, 7 are experimental, though we find liberty in Christ.<a name=147:2></a> As to it, we have died with Him: that is Romans.<a name=147:3></a> We have risen with Him is also added in Colossians: died to sin in Romans -- from the principles of this world in Colossians.<a name=147:4></a> But this, while known in Christ, or it would be hopeless labour, is experimental.<a name=147:5></a> But what gives deliverance is seeing it in Christ, though of course when free I feel the comfort of it: but deliverance is the difference of being in the flesh and out of it.<a name=147:6></a> A soul earnest after holiness labours after it and does not succeed.<a name=147:7></a> The new man craves it, seeks it, toils for it, and has it not.<a name=147:8></a> The cords that bind it down are too strong for it, but it is learning a most profitable lesson, that it <i>has no strength</i>.<a name=147:9></a> But this is while comparing its own state with what it would be before God, with what it knows God would have pleasure in.<a name=147:10></a> It is not a question of guilt, properly speaking, but of practical acceptance.<a name=147:11></a> It judges of what God's feelings towards it are, by what it is, and just because it "would" holiness cannot find rest.<a name=147:12></a> It is learning it has no more strength than righteousness; when it has really learnt this, and this is experience, and necessary experience -- "without strength" -- it recognises, as taught of God, that it has died as to the flesh with Christ, and that it is not on that ground at all, that it is not on that standing at all.<a name=147:13></a> It learns to say "when we were in the flesh," and this by the Holy Ghost, though through the appropriation by faith of Christ's death -- not for sins (that refers to guilt) but to sin.<a name=147:14></a> The soul reckons itself dead with Christ to its old position, and now alive in Him, married to Him who is risen from the dead.<a name=147:15></a> It is not that conflict does not go on, "the flesh lusts against the Spirit"; but it is not under the law of sin and death -- the cords are cut it could not break.<a name=147:16></a> In the experience of Romans 7 you have not the Spirit, but the law.<a name=147:17></a> Conflict there is; but conflict with one who ties me down is different from conflict with one whom I have power to tie down.<a name=147:18></a>

		[J H Gilmour] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- The divine nature and place of Christ must be held above all question.<a name=148:1></a> All men shall "honour the Son, even as they honour the Father": He and the Father are one -- all the fulness of the Godhead in Him bodily: "the Word was God," and created all things.<a name=148:2></a> I might quote texts without number to shew it: it enters into the very warp of the whole truth of scripture.<a name=148:3></a> I put this in the forefront of my reply.<a name=148:4></a> The ADONAI JEHOVAH of Isaiah 6 was Christ.<a name=148:5></a>

		This is not the question, nor do I believe it to be a question with our dear brother M.<a name=148:6></a> Taylor.<a name=148:7></a> Did I suppose he denied this as I have heretofore said, I might seek his restoration, but I should as so holding, disown him altogether.<a name=148:8></a> But we must remember that no man knows the Son but the Father; that this -- all concerning Him -- was when in the form of God He made Himself of no reputation ("emptied himself") and took the form of a servant and was found in the likeness of men [having] laid aside the form of divine glory, and for our sakes and for the Father's glory humbled Himself even to death "Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him"; through which having accomplished redemption He now sits as man at the right hand of God.<a name=148:9></a> He has received the glory as man though He had it with the Father before the world was.<a name=148:10></a> Hence we find that in the days of His flesh, with strong crying and tears He made His supplication unto Him who was able to save Him from death; that He could say "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?<a name=148:11></a>" and "Father into thy hands I commend my spirit," and now risen can and does say to His disciples, My Father and your Father, My God and your God.<a name=148:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not see any contradiction in these two letters.<a name=148:26></a> My present conviction is, that he did not deny worship to Christ, but that he did decline addressing himself to Christ at the Table, though leaving liberty to others.<a name=148:27></a> This happened in my own case in Brooklyn.<a name=148:28></a> There is a great difference between the worship there being addressed to Christ and to the Father; the whole tone of the meeting is changed by it: this I have long noticed.<a name=148:29></a> Though with no formal intention, I seldom give thanks without being led to both, but quite sensible of the difference; and worship, when met for it, is more suitably to the Father, if people are up to it.<a name=148:30></a> But if it was taken as objecting to addressing Christ I should resist that.<a name=148:31></a> I dare say Taylor made a kind of system of this without being clear.<a name=148:32></a> But I doubt a little that the mass of brethren are quite clear as to the real bearings of the question.<a name=148:33></a> I believe a little wisdom would have made it the occasion of all getting clearer on what spiritually is practically important, instead of its being a ground of conflict and attack.<a name=148:34></a> I have no sympathy with the way it has been done.<a name=148:35></a> If Taylor repelled any address to Christ in breaking bread, I think he would have tied himself to a system which marred the liberty of the Spirit in himself; and this, though leaving others free, I cannot doubt he did: a general denial of worship to Christ I doubt; and I somewhat doubt, but from my general acquaintance with the state of souls, that the brethren understood the bearing of insisting on worshipping the Father.<a name=148:36></a> There was a system, instead of the guidance of the Spirit in Taylor's mind, and then I fear, some self-defence, as there had been unguarded and exaggerated statements; and the whole thing has degenerated into moral charges.<a name=148:37></a>

		In Pennsylvania there was an attack made on worshipping the Lord Jesus, and contempt poured out on those who did.<a name=150:6></a> When I was at Brooklyn, and had broken the bread, and had addressed the Lord Jesus, one remarked to him, 'Mr.<a name=150:7></a> D.<a name=150:8></a> can do it!<a name=150:9></a>' He said 'He may be at liberty to do it, but I cannot.<a name=150:10></a>' He admitted that, though leaving others at liberty, he could not do it there.<a name=150:11></a> I do not think he meant to deny worship to Christ absolutely; but in getting fresh apprehensions of direct approach to the Father by grace, he got his mind, often hasty though so true to the Lord, into confusion in putting his fresh knowledge in its place; and being attacked (by what, I believe, was inadequate apprehension, though in the main seeking Christ's glory) instead of humble spiritual inquiry that all might be clear from the word, he defended what he was not clear about.<a name=150:12></a>

		MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I confess I think the state of this sister unsatisfactory.<a name=154:1></a> There was no staying away from conscience at the time (naturally a woman would be ashamed of course), and continual deception for five shillings a week.<a name=154:2></a> Still she acknowledged it honestly: so far it was well.<a name=154:3></a> If I saw there had been thorough repentance of old, I would not bring it up again, but this hardly appears .<a name=154:4></a>.<a name=154:5></a>.<a name=154:6></a> .<a name=154:7></a>

		The great question for me would be the present state of the soul, her true repentance.<a name=154:8></a> If I was satisfied she was really humbled, and gave up the pay, I would not proclaim her sin.<a name=154:9></a> It might be said that the ancient sin unknown to the assembly had been discovered, but as the soul's state had been restored before it was discovered, it was not mentioned.<a name=154:10></a> If there has not been genuine repentance, the lapse of time does not change the state: and I should say that the sin was of a very old date, but as no sign of adequate humiliation was seen exclusion was called for.<a name=154:11></a> All depends upon the state of her soul.<a name=154:12></a> There seems honesty: is there a real sense of the sin?<a name=154:13></a> As to Achan, I cannot doubt if he had put it all back they would have been spared, because then there was, though momentary failure, honest rejection of the sin.<a name=154:14></a> But that is just the question here: is there?<a name=154:15></a>

		Dear Miss Jesse Williams, -- The Lord is graciously doing what was and is always needed, making you know yourself.<a name=155:1></a> We may often accept the gospel not insincerely, and yet not have the least learnt what we are, that is what sin is in the flesh.<a name=155:2></a> As regards confession (James 5: 16) -- the form this distress takes with you -- I agree with -- , it is not a command imposed, but a means afforded for walking fully in the light, a relief if I cannot get rid of something that presses on my conscience; nay, even if I have done from time to time what keeps my spirit fretful, and out of communion, it is given as a means of relief, in order to my spirit's being conscious of being in the truth, to find some one worthy of such confidence, and opening the matter to them.<a name=155:3></a> It is a relief to open the heart, only not to be done with levity, but in the true sense of the evil, and gives occasion to the other to pray for us.<a name=155:4></a> This is connected with the government of God, and has nothing to do with deliverance.<a name=155:5></a> Its true character is lost if we look on it as an imposed obligation; but we make what is called a clean breast of it, and all sense of guile and false appearance is taken away.<a name=155:6></a> Sometimes the desire to confess is a mere effort to get the mind at ease without a thorough dealing with God which goes to the root.<a name=155:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Romans 5: 1 is simply forgiveness, faith that Christ has been delivered for our offences.<a name=155:8></a> If that be so, God must despise Christ's work before He imputes sin to me: and not only is that impossible, but God has given proof to the contrary in raising Him from the dead, and setting Him as man in glory: and He has not got my sins there.<a name=155:9></a> The work God has wrought in Christ has blotted out my sins: the Lord imputes no sin.<a name=155:10></a> Then comes another source of distress, even if I am clear that believing in Jesus I am justified from all things.<a name=155:11></a> I find my old man, my flesh, produces the evil fruit still; and this perplexes the mind if it has learned forgiveness, and brings doubts and deep distress where it has not.<a name=155:12></a> It is always in its nature legal -- that is, refers God's estimate of us, to what we are: namely, His thoughts towards us are dependent on our state before Him; whereas our state depends on His thoughts.<a name=155:13></a> See the prodigal when he found his father.<a name=155:14></a> (Compare Numbers 23: 23.<a name=155:15></a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now our peace as to our sins is simply that they are forgiven and put away: Christ has borne them.<a name=155:16></a> If I believe in Him, God has declared this; I am "justified from all things.<a name=155:17></a>" But for the discovery of our sinful state and getting deliverance there is an experimental process in us.<a name=155:18></a> The doctrine is that we died with Christ: that is Romans 6.<a name=155:19></a> But the resting on the truth found there as a doctrine, is connected with the experience found in chapter 7, the result then being in chapter 8.<a name=155:20></a> Now this experience is the painful learning that we have no strength to make good what we would in what is right.<a name=155:21></a> There is a point in this experience which often helps, but is not deliverance; that is, hating the evil which yet works in me, it is not I, for I hate the evil, and I am not what I hate.<a name=155:22></a> But after this I find what I hate too strong for me, and I am brought to the consciousness of my being without strength, the point to which God was leading me by it all: "When we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.<a name=155:23></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Your anxiety about confession and distress of soul will all disappear, when you have the deliverance which follows this full breaking down.<a name=155:24></a> We are conscious then of being in Christ, as Romans 8: 1; and then Christ is in us as the power of life (vers.<a name=155:25></a> 2, 3): Christ is substituted for self before God for us as righteousness.<a name=155:26></a> What am I before God?<a name=155:27></a> Christ.<a name=155:28></a> And He having died and risen again and received by faith, lives in us: and the flesh is treated as not me but sin that dwells in us, and we have by the Holy Ghost the sense of being children.<a name=155:29></a> In a word, Christ is substituted for self before God, and yet as livingly in us -- "as he is so are we in this world.<a name=155:30></a>" This is God's teaching; it belongs to every one who believes in Christ, but we do not get it experimentally, till the self for which Christ is substituted is thoroughly judged and broken down -- no good in it, and no means of getting into a better state however much we desire it.<a name=155:31></a> And this is the process you are going through, with a pretty strong will to be broken by it.<a name=155:32></a> I add, it is of moment in this conflict to avoid all evil -- not that this will give us peace; that comes from being dead with Christ; but if we are not watchful it gives a handle to the enemy.<a name=155:33></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ came to save the lost, and we must get to see we are lost as to our state in order to get deliverance: yet in the grace that came to save us when such, God knows when self is really judged, and then gives peace.<a name=155:34></a> In yourself in the flesh you are lost, but we get out of this standing through being dead with Christ.<a name=155:35></a> The sin in our flesh was judged on the cross.<a name=155:36></a> We hear nothing more of the prodigal son, once he found his father: all is what his father was to him.<a name=155:37></a><br>1881

		[To the same] Miss Jesse Williams, It is experimentally we learn what we are, and very humbling it is, but it casts us on the Lord so that we find He is our righteousness, not anything we are or our state, and then we get strength too; for "where sin abounded grace did much more abound.<a name=157:1></a>" You have a strong will, not accustomed to govern yourself, and hence the struggle is more painful; but the Lord is faithful to bring you through it.<a name=157:2></a> You must feel that deliverance is not for you till you get it: our will mixes itself up much more than we think with the flesh, but it is much better to suffer under it, than take it easy as you speak of.<a name=157:3></a> When you feel it pressing on your will, look away to Christ at once, and the new man being then in operation the heart gets elsewhere.<a name=157:4></a> It is not direct conflict with it, for this being under law, the motions of sin are by it.<a name=157:5></a> Then Satan uses it to bring sin on the conscience and discourage us.<a name=157:6></a> Resist him, and I do not say you will overcome, but he will flee from you," for Christ has overcome him for us.<a name=157:7></a> Then get healthful active occupations: there is plenty to do in thus world, if we have the heart for it.<a name=157:8></a> Above all, believe ever -- "My grace is <i>sufficient</i> for thee.<a name=157:9></a>" When the heart gets on Christ, all is easy; it is away from what is a snare to us.<a name=157:10></a> Once we let the devil inside, so that the mind is occupied with what the flesh tempts us with, it is far harder to get it out, than to keep it out.<a name=157:11></a> When you speak of gleams of light sometimes, it is what always happens when God is carrying through the process of self-knowledge.<a name=157:12></a> He gives us occasional deliverance so to speak, so that we know there is such a thing; like a man rising head above water and getting breath, or he would be drowned, yet goes under again when he has got enough, to shew there is such a thing as being out.<a name=157:13></a> Understand that God does this, because while He must make you know yourself because it is yourself, He is above, and can and will deliver.<a name=157:14></a> But you will find Christ faithful, and what He shews you thus that you may not despair, He will accomplish fully.<a name=157:15></a> Cry to Him -- we ought always to do it, not to faint.<a name=157:16></a> Read your Bible as something addressed to yourself, praying Him to give it the efficacy of the Spirit to your soul: no indulgence of will, but ready service, in what the house or any other duty may call for, and you will find -- not that the flesh is not there, but -- that you are not in it.<a name=157:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The power that does it is the death of Christ, not for our sins, but to sin.<a name=157:18></a> (See Romans 8.<a name=157:19></a>) God has condemned sin in the flesh on the cross, so that there is no condemnation for us.<a name=157:20></a> The sin we find working in us is worthy of condemnation, but has been condemned when He was (a sacrifice) for sin; and this we learn by faith, though God makes us learn what it is experimentally, which is just Romans 7.<a name=157:21></a> Chapter 6 is the doctrine, chapter 8 the result, when we have gone through chapter 7.<a name=157:22></a> The conflict remains, but the Spirit is there: it is no longer the conflict of natures under law.<a name=157:23></a> (Galatians 5: 17, 18.<a name=157:24></a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Look to Christ always faithful and loving, and "sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under the law, but under grace": that is, God is for you, not requiring, but giving and forgiving.<a name=157:25></a>

		[From the French.<a name=159:1></a>] DEAREST BROTHER, -- I was very glad to receive your letter and news of Switzerland, for which I thank you.<a name=159:2></a> England is pretty much in the same state -- more than one place where conversions are somewhat numerous, but nothing very striking.<a name=159:3></a> But the condition of brethren has evidently improved; there is more conscience, more life.<a name=159:4></a> All the labouring brethren who have gone about the country have returned happy, and with their souls refreshed; and God is acting in a striking way in the midst of the difficulties of London.<a name=159:5></a> Brethren can see it at a glance.<a name=159:6></a> Everything is not settled, but evil has manifested its powerlessness.<a name=159:7></a> We have had only to allow God to act, and who can do so but Himself?<a name=159:8></a> As to myself, it is the resolution I have taken from the beginning, and I bless His name for it.<a name=159:9></a> We do not sufficiently consider that it is He who works the good, and He alone who can do it, and He arranges everything.<a name=159:10></a>

		I have been very ill, dear brother: I mean my strength has sunk under the effect of too much work, and of my age, then of a serious fall while travelling.<a name=159:11></a> I did not know whether it was not God's will to take me out of this poor world .<a name=159:12></a>.<a name=159:13></a>.<a name=159:14></a> .<a name=159:15></a> I had peace, I had not any doubt, but at first I felt the ruin of the vessel, when I was alone at night with the Lord.<a name=159:16></a> The thought of being with the Lord soon became uppermost, and I was happy in going to Him, if it was His will.<a name=159:17></a> What was in question was the activity of my affection for the Lord, and not at all the assurance of faith.<a name=159:18></a> That it would be better to be up there with Him, I did not doubt; His love is to my heart a treasure more precious than ever, of infinite value: it is the effect of this experience.<a name=159:19></a> I am better now, humanly speaking: the time of my departure has not yet come.<a name=159:20></a> I work as usual in my study; I have been present at the Sunday morning meeting, and have taken part in it; then I have been at two meetings for reading the word.<a name=159:21></a>

		I asked myself whether God's will was still to use me for the brethren: on one side that, on the other to be with Himself.<a name=159:22></a> I do not cling to life, but I should desire to finish my course; and brethren have not yet got out of all the difficulties of their position.<a name=159:23></a> But God is there; I do not by any means doubt that He will fully accomplish the work of His goodness, and the courage of brethren is revived by His grace.<a name=159:24></a> Those who seek good are more united than ever.<a name=159:25></a> I am working quietly -- happy, profoundly happy in His love, with little strength, but sustained: bearing brethren on my heart, and reckoning on the Lord for them.<a name=159:26></a> It becomes me to remember that I have passed my eightieth year.<a name=159:27></a> Whether here or there, Christ is everything.<a name=159:28></a>

		[J G Deck] DEAR BROTHER, -- .<a name=161:1></a>.<a name=161:2></a>.<a name=161:3></a> As to the difficulty in England, you were all wrong in supposing that brethren were not aware that baptism had to say to it.<a name=161:4></a> They were aware, but it was all on one side.<a name=161:5></a> Two years ago, one of them had said brethren must split on this point .<a name=161:6></a>.<a name=161:7></a>.<a name=161:8></a> .<a name=161:9></a> For my own part, it was a complete demoralisation of brethren that moved me; and this has fully come out, and those in whom this want of principle really prevailed, form now a party, and seem likely to break off in one or two places where they prevailed.<a name=161:10></a> But in general consciences have been awakened, and the change for the better is strongly felt .<a name=161:11></a>.<a name=161:12></a>.<a name=161:13></a> .<a name=161:14></a> There was a strong movement to leave brethren a year or more ago, on account of the demoralisation I have spoken of; which, having been deeply exercised about it, I resisted, and we have been spared that, and the Lord has wrought wonderfully.<a name=161:15></a> One after another has got clear, and the body of gatherings in London are united in their decision: in fact, there is more union than ever.<a name=161:16></a> The deep impression of how the Lord has wrought is effectual as the things He has done, His hand has been so manifest.<a name=161:17></a> And now, dear brother, if you were to become a Paedo-baptist, I should not be a bit more attached to you, and if you love Christ better, as I trust you may daily, I should.<a name=161:18></a> I never was satisfied with the manner of my baptism, though I felt it could not be repeated: I had been received into the ostensible body with <i>bona fide</i> intention of doing so, and could not be let in again.<a name=161:19></a> I think the principle more right than Baptist ones.<a name=161:20></a>

		Since I wrote to you I have been at, what is called, death's door -- told that if I attempted to go upstairs I might die on them.<a name=161:21></a> The action of my heart failed, and often at night it felt as if it would cease entirely.<a name=161:22></a> The first feeling of the break up of the vessel was a solemn one.<a name=161:23></a> It was not doubt of the Lord's love, or of the perfectness of His work, but the fact of the breaking up of the status of my existence; but it has left, through grace, the profoundest consciousness of association with Him, and of His love, and of the Father's too, and as if I had left the world behind me: and this sense of His love is very sweet and of association with Himself.<a name=161:24></a> I am much better, though a really good night's rest is unknown to me, but study work I can do as ever through mercy; but am, for my thoughts so to speak, a dead man, for the other world: we all ought to be so, and I had long so held the truth, but it is another thing to be there.<a name=161:25></a> All I have taught has come back to me as divine truth from God, and that is a great comfort.<a name=161:26></a> I have nothing to regret but my own poor walk, though I had no object but Christ.<a name=161:27></a> But of Jacob and Israel it shall be said, "according to this time" -- the end of the wilderness -- "What hath God wrought.<a name=161:28></a>" My mind is as fresh as ever: so there is your poor old friend, John Darby, looking for Christ in you and nothing else, and knowing He is there.<a name=161:29></a>

		E L Bevir, You have a more favourable opinion of the Revision than I have.<a name=162:1></a> It is not that many passages have not been rightly corrected -- many as I did myself, so that I cannot complain; and I think there are many well composed.<a name=162:2></a> But there is, it seems to me, no acquaintance with the mind of God, and great fundamental truth lost or marred.<a name=162:3></a> Look at Romans 1: "a righteousness of God by faith," is not known to scripture.<a name=162:4></a> It is "revealed by [on the principle of] faith.<a name=162:5></a>" So (Colossians 1: 16) "in Christ all things were created.<a name=162:6></a>" They are wholly ignorant of the commonest force of ejn in Greek: so again: "Grieve not that holy Spirit of promise in which you are sealed.<a name=162:7></a>" (Ephesians 4: 30.<a name=162:8></a>) Now all this baffles a plain man, and on fundamental truths; and the word of God is for plain men.<a name=162:9></a> They are wholly ignorant of the force of English tenses; as the difference of 'saw' and 'have seen.<a name=162:10></a>' Both are past, but the shade of difference practically often of importance.<a name=162:11></a> They have not an idea of 'have.<a name=162:12></a>' The English auxiliaries vary the force without changing the time, or have two times, the participle and verb.<a name=162:13></a> 'Has' is present; 'was' present at another time, known from the phrase, <i>not</i> the word.<a name=162:14></a> I was comforted when it came out, finding several things good, and though the criticism of the Greek text vulgar, and the fashion, yet what was infidel or loose avoided.<a name=162:15></a> But when I read a chapter or two, I found it, with just corrections, for practical use a total failure.<a name=162:16></a> The Americans have generally the advantage of them .<a name=162:17></a>.<a name=162:18></a>.<a name=162:19></a> .<a name=162:20></a>

		[C Brockhaus] [From the German.<a name=163:1></a>] BELOVED BROTHER, -- I thank you from my heart for your affectionate letter.<a name=163:2></a> You must not think that, when I said those speaking French were my field of labour, I loved the French more than the German brethren.<a name=163:3></a> I do love the French brethren much, as God has much blessed my work there, and I have experienced all manner of love and kindness from them.<a name=163:4></a> I lived amongst them, and I bear them witness that nothing could exceed their friendliness; besides they are simple and generous.<a name=163:5></a> A peasant in France is nothing worth, and that is always profitable for all Christians.<a name=163:6></a> The blessing too has been great: at Pau, for instance, when I began to work there, it was said there were thirty Protestants and three Christians; now there are almost one hundred that break bread: besides a National church and an Independent congregation.<a name=163:7></a> In the south of France everything was pure unbelief, openly; now in most villages there is an assembly, often a numerous one.<a name=163:8></a> Yes, my heart says with joy, rich and poor they have all evinced continued love and kindness.<a name=163:9></a> One could hardly love brethren more than I the French; but in my spirit and natural temperament I have much more affinity with the Germans than with the French -- more readily <i>at home</i> (French has not the word).<a name=163:10></a> What I wanted to say was, that I felt God, out of England gave me the French speaking countries as a field of labour perhaps America also, and in fact this did not fail.<a name=163:11></a> In His constant goodness He added part of Germany.<a name=163:12></a> I feel, indeed, how poor my labour has everywhere been, and that God alone is the worker of any good result.<a name=163:13></a> Who could be that?<a name=163:14></a> What source of good is there if not God?<a name=163:15></a> and there everything is good.<a name=163:16></a> I always thought that; and have learnt it too, and praise God that I am nothing and God everything.<a name=163:17></a>

		Death has been realised in my experience, dear brother -- no new principle, nothing new as regards truth, no doubt of His love, or that Christ is perfect righteousness before Him.<a name=163:18></a> But I found the breaking of every sort of link with life as it is here below a real thing.<a name=163:19></a> Now this experience has been very useful to me.<a name=163:20></a> I have a much deeper sense of the grace of God and of the value of Christ -- no new truth, I believe -- and my soul rests upon the truths that I have long learnt.<a name=163:21></a> All has been made good to my soul.<a name=163:22></a> But the consciousness of love is quite another thing.<a name=163:23></a> I feel that I belong to the other world.<a name=163:24></a> For long years it was my object, because I looked for the glory of Christ, and nothing else but the salvation of souls.<a name=163:25></a> But it is sweet to belong to the Father's house and to feel that and to realise in closer consciousness a deeper sense of the endless love and pure grace of the Father, and what Christ and His love is.<a name=163:26></a> I know that He is my righteousness, and I have not to think of myself, except of my footsteps here, and it is good to think of God as the Father, and of Christ His Son.<a name=163:27></a>

		Miss Walter, I have had it on my mind to write to you ever since I heard you were sick.<a name=165:1></a> But I have been a great deal more sick myself -- more over-worked and broken-down than ill, but so that for some time, though I felt all was in the Lord's hands, I hardly thought I should recover my strength, but leave this passing scene.<a name=165:2></a> And this hindered my doing anything but what came necessarily to hand to do.<a name=165:3></a> I felt it a solemn thing: it was not doubt as to God's or Christ's love, or the efficacy of the blessed Lord's work in justifying, but the breaking up of the life and its state in which I had lived hitherto, and its being gone.<a name=165:4></a> But it was a useful experience.<a name=165:5></a> It broke the link with present life a good deal, and made Christ's and the Father's love everything, and much more real to me, and this is a great blessing.<a name=165:6></a> I am a great deal better, still feel the effect of it; but, thank God, the effect in the realisation of Christ's love in my spirit is not gone.<a name=165:7></a> I did not doubt it before, but I have a keener sense of belonging to another world, though for a little moment remaining in this -- that is, Christ and the Father's house is all.<a name=165:8></a> Now it has not come as near you: still your conscious decrease of strength, if it has not been such as to give a conscious snapping of the thread of life, still tells of its passing away.<a name=165:9></a> I trust with care you may be better and refreshed in spirit.<a name=165:10></a> Still I believe it is good to look the truth of it in the face.<a name=165:11></a> I found sovereign grace more precious than ever.<a name=165:12></a> That I knew had met all my sins; of that there was no question: but the personal love of the Father and Christ was what the sense of was so greatly increased: thank God!<a name=165:13></a> It was a comfort to me that all I had taught and laboured in was of God and from God.<a name=165:14></a> It was not on this a question of the workman at all but of the truth: I had long known, and gladly, that I was nothing.<a name=165:15></a>

		Remember that all things work together for good to those that love God, called according to His purpose, and dwell on the perfect divine love of the Father in giving the Son, and His unknowable (in its extent) love in accomplishing all for us.<a name=165:16></a> And then He loves you now.<a name=165:17></a> I have not a doubt, though much better, that all this was from God's hand; and so surely it is with you according to that love, only personally applied, which gave Christ for us -- could not be greater.<a name=165:18></a> Not a sparrow falls to the ground without our Father, and He assures us we are of value to Him.<a name=165:19></a> He makes no mistakes, and there is nothing that escapes His eye and hand.<a name=165:20></a> "He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous" -- what a mercy!<a name=165:21></a> It is not death in itself which is present to you, that is another thing, but the course of life is broken with you for the moment, and even if you recovered strength, as I trust you may, and rejoice in God's present goodness, still the experience will have been there, and give a tone to life, and that is a great gain.<a name=165:22></a> "As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field so he flourisheth.<a name=165:23></a> For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more.<a name=165:24></a> But the mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him.<a name=165:25></a>"

		As to Romans 6 of which you speak: it is not out of experience, as redemption -- a work done for us, accomplished, and where accomplishment and value is owned of God -- Christ has died for our sins and, as to imputation, we have no more conscience of sins.<a name=168:7></a> This (Romans 6) is connected with our state, and yet in one sense it closes experience, that is, the efforts of the soul to get at rest by victory.<a name=168:8></a> Chapter 7 is the experience that we cannot succeed; even where to will is present, we have no strength.<a name=168:9></a> When fully, experimentally, convinced of this, we find through grace, that as to the flesh we died in Christ's death; that what the law could not do, God sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin has condemned sin in the flesh -- not forgiven, that cannot be; but that the sin I find working in me and distressing my soul, and which I condemn and hate, but is still there, God has condemned in the cross, so that that condemnation is accomplished for me; but that it was wrought in death, so that if I was there, or am now for faith in what Christ took, it is in death -- Christ's death, the condemnation over, the death come -- I died with Him; so that the condemnation is passed, but I have died for faith.<a name=168:10></a> In Colossians 2, 3 it is God's estimate of this my state, "Ye are dead:" in Romans 6 it is faith's through grace; I reckon myself dead, because Christ who is my life died.<a name=168:11></a> In 2 Corinthians 4: 10, you have the apostle carrying it out in practice.<a name=168:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, Christ's work outside us, for us, is done entirely outside us and accepted of God; we believe in it and God's acceptance of it.<a name=168:13></a> But in being dead with Christ, though it put an end to the experience of my own useless struggles, it is something I reckon as to myself; and while it is judicial (according to Colossians 3), and hence is the way and only way of liberty, as I know God so accounts it about myself, yet I have by faith to reckon it according to what Christ has done once for all.<a name=168:14></a> I do reckon myself to have died with Him, and God so accounts me as having Him who did die as my life.<a name=168:15></a> Still, it goes on in my heart, and so far is experimental.<a name=168:16></a> I believe that the sin was condemned of God on the cross, and that God does so reckon it (Colossians 3); but Romans 6 takes it up on the faith side, and I reckon myself -- that is not judicial, though based on faith in what is, namely, Colossians 3, Romans 8: 3 -- and I have to carry it out according to 2 Corinthians 4.<a name=168:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is then experimental, as that which is the exercise of faith in us, and taking what has taken place in Christ as true of us; not a work done about us and available as accepted of God: it is so far judicial, that it is in seeing the work accomplished, and judicially in Christ, we obtain liberty with God in spite of flesh, and power in the law of the Spirit of life.<a name=168:18></a> Conflict remains, because the flesh and temptation are there, vigilance and diligence called for just because we are delivered, to maintain holiness and communion.<a name=168:19></a> The thought of imputation is gone or acceptance connected with it; till then, even if justification be known, it is a question of acceptance if not of righteousness.<a name=168:20></a> That question, as well as that of our sins, was settled on the cross, and we are free, free with God, but free to be holy, and that is real deliverance; we pass from the effort of a captive against his chains, to conflict, with the strength of Christ, against the enemy.<a name=168:21></a> Jordan and Colossians have come in, for Romans only insists on death with Christ, not on resurrection; life there is in Christ but not resurrection with Him.<a name=168:22></a> Ephesians is another thing, but that would be too large a subject now.<a name=168:23></a>

		[R T Grant] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I have long had before me as a present purpose writing to you, though I had no special subject before me, but I was brought very low, and for a little while it was more a question of leaving this world altogether than of writing letters.<a name=170:1></a> I am better: God did not see good to remove me at present, though for a little while my heart was looking that way.<a name=170:2></a> It is a good thing to have it near one.<a name=170:3></a> It was the action of the heart giving way from overwork, and I had a bad fall on that, and being in my eighty-first year I am still feeble under it, but sensibly better.<a name=170:4></a>

		As regards the question you put, it has exercised saints, and the case has been before us of old, but one would not accept a person who would not worship Christ.<a name=170:5></a> I took this same ground at Auburn, in Maine.<a name=170:6></a> There are certain vital truths connected with the Person of the Lord, which, when possessed, guard the soul from interpretations to which the soul who merely follows the words may be liable.<a name=170:7></a> Tell me I am not to worship Christ: you take away the only Christ I know.<a name=170:8></a> I have none other but one I do adore and worship with a thankful heart which owes all to Him.<a name=170:9></a> The object of John 16: 27 is to give immediate confidence in the Father, in contrast with the spirit of Martha, chapter 11: 22.<a name=170:10></a> Here the Lord says, "I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you: for the Father himself loveth you.<a name=170:11></a>" Further, the question is not of worship here at all, they should ask Him nothing (ejrwtw') but were to beg (aijtevw) the Father in His name.<a name=170:12></a> But all the angels of God are to worship Him, every knee to bow to Him.<a name=170:13></a> But more; calling on the name of the Lord is, so to speak, the definition of a Christian.<a name=170:14></a> Paul thrice besought the Lord to take away the thorn, and the Lord heard his cry and answered.<a name=170:15></a> Stephen was "invoking and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.<a name=170:16></a>" Christ is the Adonai of the Old Testament, as Isaiah 6 and John 12 and indeed Psalm 110 and other places.<a name=170:17></a> The Sitter on the throne and the Lamb are associated in Revelation 5: 13; indeed, it is a question if chapter 4 be not the Son in His divine Person.<a name=170:18></a> You cannot separate the Ancient of Days and Christ in Daniel 7, though as the Son of man, He is brought before Him; for in verse 22 the Ancient of Days comes.<a name=170:19></a> And judgment is committed to the Son "because he is the Son of man" -- yet "that all men should honour the Son even as they honour the Father.<a name=170:20></a>" I do not quote passages to prove His Deity -- that He and the Father are one, the fulness of the Godhead dwelling in Him bodily; that He was God, and created all things -- as it is not called in question.<a name=170:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the use of the Lord's name in addressing the Father, if it be that in substance the prayer is not in His name, I reject it altogether.<a name=170:22></a> The use of the blessed Lord's name did not belong to a lower state, for He says, "Hitherto ye have asked nothing in my name," whereas on His going away He says, "Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name," so that it belongs distinctly to this time.<a name=170:23></a> If it is merely the form of words, it is another thing; we may get into any routine of words and lose the force.<a name=170:24></a> But our prayers are only rightly directed to the Father in the name of Jesus; and in walking down here, it is not as being in Him we pray, nor is that praying in His name -- true as it is that we are in Him.<a name=170:25></a> It is rightly addressed to the Father according to all the value of Christ to the Father, but as a separate Person, and separate from the Father too.<a name=170:26></a> It will not do to deny the mediatorship of Christ, the Man Christ Jesus, between God and man.<a name=170:27></a> He is both present with God, and Advocate with the Father.<a name=170:28></a> The loss of the <i>mediatorial</i> place of the blessed Lord would be the loss of Christianity.<a name=170:29></a> To "<i>us</i> there is but one God the Father;" "and one Mediator between God and men, the man Jesus Christ.<a name=170:30></a>" His divine nature is not the question in this, and I know of no right prayer that is not in His name; it is not in Him, but "through him we both have access by one spirit to the Father.<a name=170:31></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One who refused to worship Christ, or who did not own His mediatorship and that in every aspect, I could not walk with.<a name=170:32></a> But I think that worship of the Father and the worship of Christ as Mediator has a different character.<a name=170:33></a> In worshipping the Father I go to one who in infinite, uncaused love (the form and glory of Godhead never left) has revealed Himself to me, brought me into the place of son, not spared His own Son for me, reconciled me to Himself by Him, and given me His Spirit that I may have the consciousness of the place He has put me in, so that I cry, Abba, Father.<a name=170:34></a> It is all through Christ but I know the Father and what He is through Him -- alas, yet how imperfectly!<a name=170:35></a> yet so as to joy or glory in God.<a name=170:36></a> It is God, but God known as Father, John 4: 23: John always makes the difference.<a name=170:37></a> So Christ tells us He was going to His Father and our Father, and His God and our God.<a name=170:38></a> It is what the Father is in Himself to whom we are brought, and as revealed in love in the Son, we being made sons, that is specially before us in worshipping Him, though all blessings flow from Him.<a name=170:39></a> Now in the worship of Christ become Mediator, I own His divine title though He laid aside His glory -- now taken again -- but it is One who has come down to me, has lived and died for me, loved me, washed me from my sins in His own blood.<a name=170:40></a> He was slain and has redeemed to God those far from Him; has made Himself of no reputation; and in unutterable grace to me, has been in all points tempted like as we are, sin apart, can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities.<a name=170:41></a> Now I quite admit a child owes worship to a loving Father -- all right; but sorrows, exercises, thorns in the flesh, cases where I want sympathy, my wants, and then the administration of everything in the church, connect themselves with my looking to and worshipping Christ viewed as Mediator.<a name=170:42></a> It is not a person simply as made partaker of the divine nature, and through the Spirit knowing the Father through the revelation of the Son, who worships the Father as so knowing Him.<a name=170:43></a> I come more into the scene as knowing Christ a tempted Saviour, as a Friend tried in the circumstances in which we are.<a name=170:44></a> Were He not God this would lose all its value, but it is of inestimable value to every exercised soul.<a name=170:45></a> But it is evident that it connects itself more with my state down here.<a name=170:46></a> It is just what is precious.<a name=170:47></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is true, that the work of Christ has been so divine and glorious, God Himself glorified in it, that it lifts us up to worship Him in respect of the excellency of what He has shewn Himself to be in that, and so we rise up to Godhead: for hereby know we love because He laid down His life for us.<a name=170:48></a> This it is important to lay fast hold of for His glory.<a name=170:49></a> We at once see the unity of thought, purpose, mind, nature, in the Son and in the Father.<a name=170:50></a> Still it is practically true that souls are apt to rest in looking at Christ, however justly, in the mediatorial aspect which concerns themselves, and their worship descends to this.<a name=170:51></a> It is not the blessed nature of God in which they joy and glory, and that known in a Father's love as their Father, but in the grace and service and benefits of which they are the objects and recipients, found in Christ.<a name=170:52></a> Now this cannot be separated when true from the source of love in Him as a divine Person, but is connected with our wants, infirmities, and failures in a word -- which, though divine grace, refer to self, and in which we ought to think of self, that the sense of it may be real, and we filled with divinely given thankfulness.<a name=170:53></a> Both are right, both are sweet, and what we have to cultivate by grace, but different.<a name=170:54></a> One lifts us up simply to God for our new man to dwell in and delight in, and surely worship Him.<a name=170:55></a> The other brings down that love in sympathetic goodness to our state, though felt and estimated by the new man -- God revealed, but as entering into all we are, and all we want, and that even to our sins.<a name=170:56></a> Now that the adoring recognition of this is true worship I fully admit, and the exclusion of it wholly wrong and deadening to the affections of the soul; but it is a different thing from the soul, by the Holy Ghost, being with and adoring the Father, to whom Christ has brought us, loved as He is loved.<a name=170:57></a> I apprehend there was the tendency in -- 's teaching, desirous of reaching to the former, to set aside the latter, and that was all wrong; but I fear brethren active in the matter had not learned to appreciate the difference between the two.<a name=170:58></a> The result was attack and then personal defences, and many things defended by others as right which were rash and ill-advised statements which might have been corrected.<a name=170:59></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Take hymns and see how many you have addressed to the Father, or which continue to have Him and not ourselves for their subject after the first verse?<a name=170:60></a> You may, perhaps, have hymns to the Father; but in revising the hymn book I found how grave a question the doing it had raised for me as to this: though our spiritual state affects everything we do, yet it requires a more spiritual state than hymns to Christ, though He be worthy of equal honour.<a name=170:61></a> But while I make this difference, you cannot separate them by a sharp mathematical line, so to speak.<a name=170:62></a> Affections do not flow in that way.<a name=170:63></a> And the love of the Father and the Son run into one another.<a name=170:64></a> If the Father did not spare His Son, the Son in the same divine love gave Himself.<a name=170:65></a> We have known the Father through His revelation of Him.<a name=170:66></a> "He that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also.<a name=170:67></a>" The incarnation, and service which follows it in grace, has given a special character to our heart relationship with Christ, but after all, all is of the same divine source.<a name=170:68></a> Worshipping the Father as being in Christ has been spoken of, as substituting it for worshipping Christ; but I find no such thought in scripture.<a name=170:69></a> In Christ is our place and privilege; worship is a separate thing which springs through grace from our hearts individually, or, yet rather, collectively; but worshipping in Him I find no trace of in scripture.<a name=170:70></a>

		Dear Mrs.<a name=174:1></a> Browne, -- I was very glad to hear of these different souls whom God is leading on.<a name=174:2></a> It is always so pleasant to see God working in blessing, and souls opening under the rays of His grace, for what He does, though it may be in a short moment, is eternal .<a name=174:3></a>.<a name=174:4></a>.<a name=174:5></a> .<a name=174:6></a> It is not a good sign when people do not like a yoke being put upon them if the yoke be God's word.<a name=174:7></a> "Take my yoke upon you and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly of heart.<a name=174:8></a>" We like our own will.<a name=174:9></a> There may be a bondage which is not of Christ, if it is that of man on the new man, but subjection of will is the secret of all peaceful walk in this world.<a name=174:10></a> It is Christ's work which gives peace to the conscience; but it is a subdued will, having none of our own which in great and in little things makes us peaceful in heart in going through a world of exercise and trial.<a name=174:11></a> All in us, morally speaking, is sin, and having done with that, we live in what the Father is for us, and on what Christ is a wondrous exchange.<a name=174:12></a> Self is always alienation from God; that is, in its working.<a name=174:13></a>

		This anti-christian statement that sinners of the Gentiles have no need of forgiveness is connected with, partly founded on, a false interpretation of 1 John 1: 9, as if it applied only to believers, that they are cleansed from particular sins; but though this may be supported by souls not yet set free, it is not in the passage.<a name=179:48></a> It is not, if we fail the blood of Christ cleanses us, but "if we walk in the light, as God is in the light .<a name=179:49></a>.<a name=179:50></a>.<a name=179:51></a> the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin" -- from All sin, not from any particular fault.<a name=179:52></a> It is the christian state or standing in the light as God is, and cleansed so as to be fit to be there.<a name=179:53></a> After that John speaks of particular sins: "These things write I unto you, that ye sin not.<a name=179:54></a> If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father.<a name=179:55></a>" (1 John 2: 1) There is no re-shedding of blood, no re-sprinkling of blood in scripture "The worshippers once purged have no more conscience of sins": "By one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.<a name=179:56></a>" It is not that we do not offend, but there is no imputing of the sin as guilt: "Blessed is the man to whom the Lord doth not impute sin.<a name=179:57></a>" And in Romans 4, where this is found, it is expressly declared it is not for the circumcision only.<a name=179:58></a> It is for all those who believe, "though they be not circumcised, that righteousness might be imputed to them also.<a name=179:59></a>" Your teaching has forgotten that there were those who were not Christians, who were not under law either, and accounted righteous by faith and forgiven their sins.<a name=179:60></a> See Romans 4, where this point is fully discussed to set aside what you hold.<a name=179:61></a> "There is one God, and one mediator between God <i>and man</i> the man Christ Jesus; who gave Himself a ransom <i>for all</i>, to be testified in due time.<a name=179:62></a>" A ransom is that by which redemption comes, is wrought; to have the good of it Christ must be believed in: but as the righteousness is of God, it is as good for the Gentile as for the Jew, and is needed by the Gentile as the Jew.<a name=179:63></a> "There is no difference.<a name=179:64></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will now take up the question which your teacher connects with redemption, and where he is very confused.<a name=179:65></a> He declares he has only the earnest of the Spirit -- he does not say of what, only goes on to the redemption of the body.<a name=179:66></a> That we are waiting for that is all true (Ephesians 1): but in the previous part of the chapter, what is spoken of redemption is spoken of a something we have, "to the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.<a name=179:67></a> In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins.<a name=179:68></a>" According to the teaching you have now, this is Jewish, though there is not a word about law or Jews.<a name=179:69></a> You are not accepted in the Beloved, you have not redemption and forgiveness, and in your madness pretend you did not need it.<a name=179:70></a> The passage speaks of those who are chosen in Him before the foundation of the world: I suppose there were no Jews or Gentiles when "predestinated to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will.<a name=179:71></a>" All this belongs, according to this passage, to those who have redemption through His blood.<a name=179:72></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You are taught that redemption is 'only to the state in which <i>Adam was</i>, that is, Eden: as he was earthy, such are they who are earthy, and can, by redemption, <i>only</i> be brought to the state in which Adam was before he fell!<a name=179:73></a>' Why so?<a name=179:74></a> Why is the sacrifice of God's Son, made sin for us, to produce no other effect than creation?<a name=179:75></a> I read: "He hath made him to be sin for us, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him"; or, as we have just read, "We have the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace"; "He hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ.<a name=179:76></a>" (Ephesians 1) Besides, redemption is identified with the forgiveness of sins.<a name=179:77></a> What has that to do with innocent Adam?<a name=179:78></a> If it be the intervention and work of God, it has the effect purposed of God, and according to the worth of that work; and that is, that we should be "heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ.<a name=179:79></a>" (Romans 8: 17) "So that in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.<a name=179:80></a>" (Ephesians 2: 7) The whole train of thought in your doctrine denies the whole scheme and revelation of Christianity, which sets us redeemed and forgiven in the second Man, the last Adam, in all that belongs to Him as the glorified Man, as the Son of man.<a name=179:81></a> You get the same truth in Galatians 4: 7, where it applies expressly to Gentiles.<a name=179:82></a> (See verse 8) "Christ was made under the law to redeem them that were under the law," but He was also made of a woman, the Mediator between God and <i>man</i>.<a name=179:83></a>

		We are told 'he could not say all have sinned till he proved the Jew guilty; and now having quoted their own scriptures and prophets, he proves them guilty, now he writes "all.<a name=179:84></a>" 'All right; but then the Gentile is guilty, has sinned, but being dead does not require forgiveness.<a name=179:85></a>' 'We have all sinned, are all guilty, but do not require forgiveness.<a name=179:86></a>' It is a shame to have to reason about such stuff!<a name=179:87></a> And then he impudently says exactly the contrary of what the passage says, 'He brings in the free justification from the law.<a name=179:88></a>' Scripture (Romans 3: 21, 22) says "But now without law [apart altogether from it] the righteousness of God is manifested"; and to whom?<a name=179:89></a> -- those under the law to justify them from it?<a name=179:90></a> Not the least, but "the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference: for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God, being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, etc.<a name=179:91></a>, etc.<a name=179:92></a>, that he might be just and the Justifier of him that believeth.<a name=179:93></a>" Hence in chapter 4: 11 he expressly tells us it comes on the uncircumcision, not to justify from the law, for they were not under it, but without law, having nothing to do with law (cwri;" novmou).<a name=179:94></a> Now you are taught that when Jews are proved to have sinned and be guilty, all are -- Gentiles as well as Jews; and also that 'the word no difference applies between Jews and Gentiles, not between Jews and God.<a name=179:95></a>' All right: but then Gentiles have sinned, and Gentiles are guilty.<a name=179:96></a> All the world is guilty: all, Gentiles as well as Jews, have sinned.<a name=179:97></a> "Being justified freely by his [God's] grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.<a name=179:98></a>" Now this justification and this redemption is directly and unquestionably applied, and formally said of all those who had sinned, all Gentiles and Jews, for there is no difference.<a name=179:99></a> All this is largely confirmed and developed in Galatians 4.<a name=179:100></a> I do not dwell on Ephesians 1, 2, 3, where Jews and Gentiles are carefully identified in the same privileges, according to the eternal purposes of God, the middle wall of partition being broken down -- Jews and Gentiles, they are all chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world -- it would be to expound the whole epistle.<a name=179:101></a> To say those spoken of in the beginning of chapter 1 are privileges only of Jews, is to talk nonsense in defiance of what is said.<a name=179:102></a> It is all the saints and faithful at Ephesus, who were chiefly Gentiles (see Acts 29: 9, 10); and Gentiles are carefully introduced, as his own mission is developed in chapter 3 where he calls himself prisoner for them -- Gentiles.<a name=179:103></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I turn to another point: 'God is not Creator of the unconverted!<a name=179:104></a>' It is denied 'that we, before we were saved, were created by God!<a name=179:105></a>' I have been asked for a text.<a name=179:106></a> I quote Acts 17: 25, 28: "He giveth to all life, and breath, and all things; and hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation.<a name=179:107></a>" He is addressing the heathen and says, "For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.<a name=179:108></a>" 'Adam [before he fell] was God's creature.<a name=179:109></a>' Genesis 6: 7: God says, "I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth.<a name=179:110></a>" But according to this teaching, He had not created at all what He was going to destroy.<a name=179:111></a> Malachi 2: 10: "Hath not one God created us?<a name=179:112></a>" Even the poor women have a chance of thinking themselves God's creatures.<a name=179:113></a> "For neither was the man created for the woman, but the woman for the man.<a name=179:114></a>" So in Ephesians 3: 9: "God who created all things.<a name=179:115></a>" Ecclesiastes 12: 1: "Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth.<a name=179:116></a>" Will it be said He is the Creator as well as the Redeemer of the Jews, not of the Gentiles?<a name=179:117></a> Then He is God of the Jews, and not of the Gentiles, not "of the spirits of all flesh" (Numbers 16: 22; 27: 16); and Jews and Gentiles are distinct races of beings, have not a common Creator.<a name=179:118></a> John 8 refers to Jews.<a name=179:119></a> Further, if it be because we come in by ordinary generation, then nothing is created of God; for not a tree, not a bit of grass, but comes from another, as is written, whose seed is in itself.<a name=179:120></a> 'God created nothing but the earth, and what was first upon it.<a name=179:121></a>' Then "the things which are seen" (Hebrews 11: 3) has no sense.<a name=179:122></a> John 8: 44 is referred to: there is not a word about creating.<a name=179:123></a> They had the spirit of Satan, murder and lying -- he was the father of it.<a name=179:124></a> It was their moral character.<a name=179:125></a> So in 1 John 3: 8: 'creature, or God's only work in creating.<a name=179:126></a>' This is because the word "made" is used, and that they are begotten of Adam.<a name=179:127></a> The poor women were never (not even Eve innocent was) created of God; nothing therefore at all that exists, is created of God!<a name=179:128></a> Genesis 1: heaven and earth were created.<a name=179:129></a> God created great whales, and all that moves in the sea.<a name=179:130></a> (verse 21) The difference of "created" and "made" is imaginary.<a name=179:131></a> God said, "Let us make man.<a name=179:132></a>" .<a name=179:133></a>.<a name=179:134></a>.<a name=179:135></a> "So God created man.<a name=179:136></a>" (Verses 26, 27) And He rested "from all the work which he had made," and in it "he rested from all his work which God created and made" (Chapter 2: 2, 3 -- lit.<a name=179:137></a> "created to make"), and "these are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens.<a name=179:138></a>" (verse 4) In Hebrews 11: "By faith we understand," etc.<a name=179:139></a> Now that is exactly creation.<a name=179:140></a> Colossians 1: 16: "For by him [the Son] were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones," etc.<a name=179:141></a> But the coming in of sin, we are told, has made the difference -- not as to his being God's creature: "he that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning.<a name=179:142></a>" And "in this are manifest the children of God and the children of the devil.<a name=179:143></a> Whoever does not practise righteousness is not of God.<a name=179:144></a>" We are the children of Abraham, if we are in Christ; but of creation not a word, whereas sons of Belial is a common expression.<a name=179:145></a> They are morally his offspring by murder and falsehood; as the Lord called Peter, Satan, when hindering His obedience unto death, through the influence of the world's Prince.<a name=179:146></a> As Christ says in this chapter, "Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.<a name=179:147></a>" (John 8: 23) To be in the spirit of this world was to be from beneath.<a name=179:148></a> I might add as to present creatures Psalm 104, which celebrates creation as it is, and when we read verse 30, after speaking of creatures dying and returning to their dust, "Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth.<a name=179:149></a>" The guilt of the heathen was that they "served the creature more than the Creator.<a name=179:150></a>" To Elihu who gives us the thought and mind of God in contrast with Job and his friends (Job 33: 4, 6) "the spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.<a name=179:151></a>" Yet he is speaking of natural life: "I also am formed out of the clay.<a name=179:152></a>" Again, chapter 34: 14, 15: "If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath, all flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again to his dust.<a name=179:153></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As far as I can gather what is taught (for the statement is obscure), the possession of eternal life is denied.<a name=179:154></a> That we have the earnest of the Spirit till the full development of it in glory is true.<a name=179:155></a> But at present I am told I <i>only have</i> the earnest of the Spirit.<a name=179:156></a> But it is said that life is mine by faith.<a name=179:157></a> The earnest of eternal life is not scriptural thought.<a name=179:158></a> Leaving the statement there, I give the positive statement of scripture.<a name=179:159></a> First, it is because we are sons that the Spirit of God's Son is given to us: so that we must have life, be sons, to be sealed and cry, Abba, Father.<a name=179:160></a> More is needed, but this is clear; you must be a son, which is by faith in Christ Jesus (Galatians 3: 26), or it is false to say, Abba, Father.<a name=179:161></a> This is by the Spirit given to us.<a name=179:162></a> (Galatians 4: 6) But I will cite direct statements.<a name=179:163></a> John 3: 36: "He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life.<a name=179:164></a>" John 5: 24: "He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.<a name=179:165></a>" 1 John 5: 11, 12: "And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.<a name=179:166></a> He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.<a name=179:167></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this is the result of this short statement of the teaching you accept.<a name=179:168></a> You deny God is our Creator.<a name=179:169></a> You deny redemption, except of the body at the end.<a name=179:170></a> You deny that we have need of forgiveness of sins when converted to God; and unless an obscure sentence be cleared up, you deny we have eternal life -- we have only the earnest of the Spirit.<a name=179:171></a> Now I do not touch on ecclesiastical questions, though you seem to me in this also to have cast the truth overboard; but you cannot expect to be owned to be Christians, denying all these fundamental truths.<a name=179:172></a> It is impossible.<a name=179:173></a> You may ask why I call you brethren I do so, because I trust you may be delivered from these sad delusions of the enemy, in which the fundamental truths of Christianity, as to its application to us, are denied.<a name=179:174></a> I might have reasoned a great deal on the statements on which I comment, but I have preferred citing scripture as the adequate reply.<a name=179:175></a> May the Lord deliver you from the delusion of the enemy.<a name=179:176></a>

		[W Loughlan] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I -- indeed I might say we, for the brethren invited to meet the American labourers were here, and it naturally passed on to several -- was greatly rejoiced to hear that God had graciously made your mind clear as to your true position and Christian path before Him.<a name=186:1></a> I have been more than fifty years in it, and have never had a shade of question on my mind.<a name=186:2></a> I have seen failure in myself and others, but it remained in scripture where God had put it.<a name=186:3></a> I am additionally thankful that it is from scripture, not from persuasion, that you have learned it.<a name=186:4></a> God can of course use others to lead us on, but we know better on what we rest when it is in scripture itself we have found it.<a name=186:5></a> Difficulties I have no doubt you will find; there are a certain class which are only in the path of faith, but the joy of the Lord is with us in them.<a name=186:6></a> In the last days, too, perilous times shall come we read, and that we must experience, but the light and strength of the Lord is there.<a name=186:7></a> What a bright picture we have in Luke 1, 2 of the poor and unknown remnant who walked with God in the midst of the unparalleled wickedness of Israel!<a name=186:8></a> As to your outward path God will shew it to you.<a name=186:9></a> We have only to find His will, and we shall find Him in it.<a name=186:10></a> -- will I dare say, have told you of our meetings here: there was much happy communion in it.<a name=186:11></a>

		MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I was very glad to get your letter and hear of the saints too.<a name=186:13></a> People newly come out always need pretty constant pastoral care, and especially in colonies where the tendency is to loosen all the habits.<a name=186:14></a> It is a comfort to know, that through all the Lord will keep His own; I do not mean that labourers and all saints should not be exercised as to it, but that when they see failure they have this to fall back upon.<a name=186:15></a> But we desire to see them as a watered garden.<a name=186:16></a> What a joy it is when we see them so!<a name=186:17></a> It is the power of the Spirit of God which makes them united and happy together, but then He must work in the individual heart, that it may be so, that they may be as "willows by the water-courses.<a name=186:18></a>" And there is grace enough in Christ to do it.<a name=186:19></a> The text has often been a comfort to me, "My grace is <i>sufficient</i> for thee"; but then we must learn, and experimentally -- so Paul himself was obliged to do -- the other part practically; and this is a very great thing to learn practically -- I mean that we are nothing: we all know that it is true but to walk in the sense of it.<a name=186:20></a> It makes the difference between one saint and another; only we must refer to Christ in grace, or we might get discouraged.<a name=186:21></a> But a man who is discouraged is not really there: he does not find strength; but where is he looking for it?<a name=186:22></a> When we are really nothing we look to Christ, and we know that He can do everything and, while contending in prayer for a blessing, we know that He does, and orders everything.<a name=186:23></a> I was saying to a young clergyman recently out, and fearing as to the future of brethren -- the Christian has no future but glory.<a name=186:24></a> All he has to do is to do God's will at the moment, and the rest is all in God's hands; only we know that glory awaits us.<a name=186:25></a> But this does suppose a just sense of our own nothingness, and blessed confidence in God, so that knowing His love we can leave all to Him, knowing that He does all at any rate, and that He will make all issue in blessing.<a name=186:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have not much to tell you of these countries.<a name=186:27></a> Dr.<a name=186:28></a> Wolston thought of asking the American labourers to England, and they came gladly to meet in a home conference those of us who had laboured there, and they enjoyed it amazingly, and we all got unusual blessing.<a name=186:29></a> They went round too to various gatherings as the Lord led, and I hear their ministry was very fresh and they enjoyed it much.<a name=186:30></a> I quite trust it may be a means of real blessing.<a name=186:31></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the difficulties among brethren, it is a moment in which there is a very great and organised effort to make a party against righteousness.<a name=186:32></a> It is of course sorrowful, but in effect I do not know that it is more than the needing sifting of God's hand.<a name=186:33></a> My weak state makes it a little trying to me, but I trust the Lord and work on.<a name=186:34></a> There is much to be thankful for, but it is a sifting process at present, and we have to await the result of God's dealing.<a name=186:35></a> The preservation of His testimony is what I look and pray for.<a name=186:36></a> Nor do I doubt of it, but I have left all in His hands, only answering letters written to me.<a name=186:37></a>

		The Lord be abundantly with you, dear brother.<a name=186:38></a> He is all to us, and soon will be so without a cloud, and that will be a blessed time.<a name=186:39></a> I have happy accounts of God's work both in France and Switzerland -- in the former where they had, a good while, gone a good deal to sleep.<a name=186:40></a> May we be found watching and waiting for Him!<a name=186:41></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the revised version I think very badly of it indeed.<a name=186:42></a> Individual passages are more accurately translated, but they have not had the mind of God at all, and that on fundamental points.<a name=186:43></a> I have written a paper on it, to be printed, not published.<a name=186:44></a> I have had a slight paralytic stroke -- very slight indeed, but it disables me a little in my activities.<a name=186:45></a>

		Dear P Gibbs, It is time I should write to you.<a name=188:1></a> It was not for want of often thinking of you that I have not, but what little strength I have has been spent on the French Old Testament and the English New, both laborious work.<a name=188:2></a> But I felt you were a good deal isolated, and was longing to write a line .<a name=188:3></a>.<a name=188:4></a>.<a name=188:5></a> .<a name=188:6></a> All around God is carrying on His clearing work.<a name=188:7></a> What I am anxious for is that brethren should see it is His hand which has indeed wonderfully interposed; but that calls for lowliness and thankfulness.<a name=188:8></a> The sense of His goodness always humbles.<a name=188:9></a> Exulting is never right; but what ground for it when we have allowed to come in and grow up amongst us what God in His mercy has to put out?<a name=188:10></a> Still we have great cause for thankfulness and one thing I have noticed too, that God has never stopped His work by and amongst brethren.<a name=188:11></a> It is nothing very great, but it has constantly gone on, and is now too shewing itself .<a name=188:12></a>.<a name=188:13></a>.<a name=188:14></a> What I have specially had in my mind to pray for as to this is, that He would maintain His testimony, the testimony He raised up among brethren.<a name=188:15></a> Nothing is better than visiting work, without assuredly depreciating the gospel.<a name=188:16></a> What I feel is to be done, and as far as able always have done, is to seek to present Christ according to the state of the soul one has to say to.<a name=188:17></a> I never bother myself about brethren, if God gathers them it will be well; but my business is one -- what does that soul want?<a name=188:18></a> It may be deeper conviction of sin: it may be, that Christ has made peace; but whatever it is, that is what I have to bring, and look to Him to seal the word and make it good; and then feed on Him for oneself, for He is there in grace for us, and unsearchable riches in Him.<a name=188:19></a>

		[Alek Robertson] DEAR BROTHER, -- I must be brief.<a name=189:1></a> I believe Christ bound the strong man in the wilderness after the Holy Ghost coming upon Him, and the Father owning Him as His Son.<a name=189:2></a> The relationship and position of accepted man being established there, He goes as such, led of the Spirit, to be tempted of the devil, who sought, if He were a Son, to get Him to put Himself out of the place of a servant and failed.<a name=189:3></a> The strong man was bound and He proceeded to spoil his goods, delivering all from his power; but that as his temptations were as to this world and the effects of sin, sin itself remained.<a name=189:4></a> He departed from Him for a season (Luke), and then the consequence of taking up the sinner, which was a second thing, came upon Him.<a name=189:5></a>

		[E J Harding] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I was glad to receive your kind letter, and to know that you are happily arrived and quietly established at -- , though it be a somewhat cold climate; but it is hardly colder for you Canadians than Canada for us English, and I liked it.<a name=190:23></a> But, here or there, it is where God would have us, that is our place, and where we may expect a blessing and the consciousness of His presence.<a name=190:24></a> He may and does keep us, in His patient and perfect goodness, everywhere, but it is in the way of His will that His presence is revealed to us, so that we walk in the light of His countenance.<a name=190:25></a> He kept Abraham in Egypt, but he had no altar from Bethel back to Bethel.<a name=190:26></a>

		I trust fully that you are both in that way; I do not think it an evil that a young married couple should go through the rough of life a little together at the beginning; it binds their hearts together.<a name=190:27></a> Surely there is a far higher and better bond, but as to circumstances the comfort each is to the other, and the sustaining help each is to the other, bind their hearts together for life down here is made up of small things.<a name=190:28></a> If it were only when a husband comes home cold and tired, finding ease and a welcome and comfort, as far as may be, and the like, there is the continuous sense of one caring for the other, and that is a great point.<a name=190:29></a> They are thrown on one another, and where affection is, this cultivates it, and I believe this is of all importance; and then what accompanies it, entire confidence one in another.<a name=190:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But this is all maintained, dear brother, by Christ being all to each, for self is thus set aside, and the grace of Christ working in the heart overcomes all difficulties, and, while Christ is the motive which rises over all, makes the other the object of affectionate and considerate service.<a name=190:31></a> But for our own sakes too He is everything, light to the soul, but the blessed expression and communicator of the love of God; and for this there must be real diligence.<a name=190:32></a> All that is around us, and even real duties, are constantly soliciting us away from Him, and tending to weaken us spiritually.<a name=190:33></a> When we cleave to Him, all goes on smoothly in the heart, in the consciousness of His love: we know how to confide in and count on Him, nothing separates us from His love.<a name=190:34></a> The distractions of the world lose their power, because the heart is elsewhere: nine-tenths of our temptations would not be such at all; as a mother who thought her child was run over by a train would not see fine things in the streets on her way down.<a name=190:35></a> And what are really our duties we should serve Christ in.<a name=190:36></a> A holy intimacy with Christ is the strength and light of the soul, and He encourages us in it, for He is full of love.<a name=190:37></a> How near He brings Peter at the end of Matthew 17.<a name=190:38></a> The tribute was the tribute to the temple, to Jehovah, and while He shews He knew all and could command the creatures -- the fish to bring the exact needed sum -- He says to Peter, "Lest we should offend them," -- you and I are children, we do not owe the tribute, and -- "that give for me and for thee.<a name=190:39></a>" And He spoke as intimately and familiarly to His disciples about His death as He did to Moses and Elias.<a name=190:40></a> It is a gracious and blessed Saviour we have; He delights in our being near Him, and soon will have us so for ever, and like Him too.<a name=190:41></a> May He make you more and more like Him daily!<a name=190:42></a> Oh!<a name=190:43></a> cultivate intimacy with Him; it keeps the conscience alive and the heart happy.<a name=190:44></a> You may be comparatively a young Christian, and I an old one; but He is all we want, each of us, and suited to each.<a name=190:45></a> You can have Him to keep you in the journey before you, and I can look back and see a patience and a faithfulness, a goodness beyond all my thoughts and all my praise.<a name=190:46></a> It is a sweet thought that in going on I am drawing near being with Him for ever.<a name=190:47></a> If spared, you have more of the toil of the way; with me it is almost over.<a name=190:48></a> You have a helpmeet, and I have trod it alone; but all is lost, so to speak, in His grace and faithfulness.<a name=190:49></a>

		[Mr Jeffreys] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I agree much with what you say at the end, that one must find it in the whole as a revealed fact.<a name=195:1></a> Thus we need His blood-shedding, His death, His forsaking [on the part] of God; all together make up His work.<a name=195:2></a> But when He shed His blood, He did not suffer; He was already dead.<a name=195:3></a> And this was important.<a name=195:4></a> Had the soldiers killed Him He would not have laid down His own life, it would have been taken from Him.<a name=195:5></a> Had He not shed His blood, the great sign that His life was given would have been wanting.<a name=195:6></a> Now, I get what expiated and what purified in His death; but He laid down life Himself.<a name=195:7></a> Then being forsaken of God -- none of us can fathom what it was to One who had dwelt in the bosom of the Father, to find His soul as a man forsaken of Him, and that as made sin.<a name=195:8></a> In the measure in which He knew holiness and love, and that was absolute, He felt what it was to be [made] sin before God and forsaken.<a name=195:9></a> And though the physical death came after, then He, morally speaking, drank the cup.<a name=195:10></a> It was necessary He should freely give up His own spirit, all being finished, in peace.<a name=195:11></a> John's word is not "He gave up the ghost," but "gave up his spirit" -- a divine act when all was done -- and in peace and confidence as a man, as in Luke, "Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit.<a name=195:12></a>" The use of the word Father is important here.<a name=195:13></a> He does not say "My God" in His life -- not even in Gethsemane for He was in full communion with His Father.<a name=195:14></a> In the forsaking it is "My God," though in perfect submission, and saying "My.<a name=195:15></a>" After His resurrection He uses both, in His message by Mary Magdalene; for now God was for us in righteousness and we children.<a name=195:16></a> But "Father into thy hands" is perfect peace in the enjoyment of sonship.<a name=195:17></a> But He must actually die, or nothing would have been done; but the sting and curse were gone out of it; and He laid down His life in communion with, and in obedience to, the Father.<a name=195:18></a> It is when really already dead, that His blood which had all the value of that death was shed (with the water) to cleanse from sin.<a name=195:19></a> It must have the value of death in it, yet death not be by it.<a name=195:20></a> Sin gives death its sting, and that must be borne -- yet death have none but be the free giving up of His own spirit.<a name=195:21></a> All this was accomplished.<a name=195:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We learn it in parts, but it all made one great sacrifice, from meeting with God as made sin, His personal dignity in giving up His own life, and in the shedding forth the blood and water when all was finished -- the shedding forth that in which its value is applied to us.<a name=195:23></a> But it is of all moment to view it adoringly, and not in dissecting it, as it were; only fully recognising as far as we can the import of drinking the cup where all the ingredients that sin had put into death are found It is in the spirit of adoration -- and withal, knowing what sin is -- we must dwell on it, but the glory of His person giving Himself for God the Father's glory and then for our sins, and made sin for us, and devoted love to Him -- that we must look at it.<a name=195:24></a>

		Next, Acts 13: 2 was not the assembly.<a name=197:8></a> The prophets were fasting and praying together and the Holy Ghost spoke with authority by one of them, "Separate me.<a name=197:9></a>" The state<a href="#197:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a> of the individuals sent had nothing to do with it.<a name=197:10></a> God in His government may employ a fitting vessel, but no state of fitness can separate by divine authority a person for a specific apostolic work.<a name=197:11></a> And this is the point: the free action, and divine authority of the Holy Ghost; that is, of God.<a name=197:12></a> I have no doubt, as a general rule for edification, usefulness in service depends on the state of the servant, but to use this as a plea for denying the direct action of the Spirit is ruinous.<a name=197:13></a> It is not a chandelier of light, though each should be filled with the Spirit, but the personal free action of the Spirit.<a name=197:14></a> Scripture recognises the diligent use of the word, "Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them," etc.<a name=197:15></a>: but to use this to deny the sovereign freedom of the Spirit is also ruinous and destroys our dependence on and guidance by Him.<a name=197:16></a> In Acts 8 we have first "the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip.<a name=197:17></a>" Now, I do not doubt that the Lord chose a fit person in Philip, but the angel's speaking to him was not the state of Philip's soul.<a name=197:18></a> Then we find the Spirit telling him to go to the chariot.<a name=197:19></a> Then the Spirit "caught away," -- a word in Greek or English leaving no pretext for the interpretation<a href="#197:f3"><sup class="footnote-link">+++</sup></a> given to it -- "and the eunuch saw him no more.<a name=197:20></a>" In Paul's journey the Spirit of Jesus did not allow him to go into Mysia, and they were forbidden to preach in Asia or Bithynia.<a name=197:21></a>

		It is alleged that this independent action of the Spirit belongs only to the Old Testament, as Saul, Balaam<a href="#197:f4"><sup class="footnote-link">++++</sup></a> etc.<a name=197:22></a> This is a mistake: Caiaphas prophesied.<a name=197:23></a> It will be said that this was in Judaism.<a name=197:24></a> But Paul teaches it doctrinally (1 Corinthians 13) "Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not love, I am .<a name=197:25></a>.<a name=197:26></a>.<a name=197:27></a> nothing.<a name=197:28></a>" The very fact of tongues is an independent action of the Spirit, for they did not understand what they said, and if there was not an interpreter were to remain silent.<a name=197:29></a> Tell me that this is lost -- I understand you, but then do not deny that the Holy Ghost so acted.<a name=197:30></a> But there is a difference to be made between 1 Corinthians 12 and Ephesians 4.<a name=197:31></a> In the former the Holy Ghost down here acts with divine authority and power, but it is simply giving power (in gifts) to whom He will; but "the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets," not more than "two or at the most three" were to speak.<a name=197:32></a> The word of God, the authority of Christ in the church, ordered the exercise of the power.<a name=197:33></a> If a man spoke with tongues, and -- it was so completely the Holy Ghost -- he did not understand what he said (a case supposed) he was to be silent, unless he or another could interpret.<a name=197:34></a> The apostle preferred to speak with his understanding, and edify the assembly, to which end all was to be directed.<a name=197:35></a> In the latter case (Ephesians 4), it is Christ ascended on high, who, having received the Holy Ghost from the Father, gives for the spiritual need of the church (and here there are no gifts which are miraculous, in the ordinary sense, but) "apostles and prophets evangelists, pastors and teachers," and the promise that these will continue to the end, and then (verse 16) what every joint supplies in the measure of every part.<a name=197:36></a>

		But the Holy Ghost has been given, and come down, and all goodness and wisdom in exercise is from Him.<a name=197:37></a> He formed the body, He also makes us members.<a name=197:38></a> Even Christ "by the Spirit of God cast out devils.<a name=197:39></a>" We are to be "led by the Spirit," and surely in the most solemn part of our lives here, our spiritual activity in the church of God, this is not to be given up, and we do without it.<a name=197:40></a> This is not giving up, or acting without, our understanding.<a name=197:41></a> The apostle preferred action with understanding, but that did not exclude the direct action of the Spirit.<a name=197:42></a> Men speak of impulse,<a href="#197:f5"><sup class="footnote-link">+++++</sup></a> so that the notion of the Spirit's action is lost, and it is of man.<a name=197:43></a> But if it is not of the Spirit, it is merely of man.<a name=197:44></a> The apostle would have the Spirit and the understanding.<a name=197:45></a> (1 Corinthians 14: 15.<a name=197:46></a>) The saying we could not then judge is a strange blunder of human reasoning, for it was when there was direct revelation they were called on so to judge.<a name=197:47></a> Faith, direct looking to God and His power, is identical with the action of the Spirit in its source and results; and what is called faith in Hebrews 11.<a name=197:48></a> is constantly referred to the Spirit in the Old Testament.<a name=197:49></a> All direct action of God as to the creature, and finally in divine things, from creation on, is by the Spirit in scripture: no good thought in us but from the Spirit, no wisdom.<a name=197:50></a> It is the Spirit that lusts against the flesh.<a name=197:51></a> Waiting humbly on the Lord, that He may lead us to act, or not to act, and lead us in acting, and that habitually and in all things, is not acting from impulse, but the contrary, and the leading will not fail.<a name=197:52></a> If we are to judge, what are we to judge -- whether what is said or done is of the Spirit, or not?<a name=197:53></a> If it is not of the Spirit, it is of the flesh: only the paramount authority and order of the word, which is certainly by the Spirit is maintained.<a name=197:54></a>

		[From the French.<a name=201:1></a>] -- - As to affairs in England, it would be difficult to give you a detailed history; but the principle is simple enough, and it is with this we must be occupied, so as to discern what is of God and what is of Satan, and be guided in our walk to the glory of God.<a name=201:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You know that the natural tendency, as numbers increase in the assemblies, is that the heart wearies a little of the truth, which at the outset had authority over us to cause us to walk in the truth in.<a name=201:3></a> separation from human systems; and at the same time the mind gets more and more occupied with persons who compose the assembly, till at last the truth gives way to the persons in our hearts, the conscience to the intelligence, Christ to the man, and brethren become, in another way, a system of the worst description: this is Satan's aim, and it is in this way that he assails the brethren.<a name=201:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first fruit from this bad root is, that brethren are occupied with themselves to the exclusion of other Christians who are equally members of the body of Christ: they think of themselves more than of the Lord.<a name=201:5></a> They do all they can to keep the gathering together, losing sight more or less of the great truths which have acted upon hearts individually, and which truths formed the gathering, not as a great work visible and recognised on the earth, but as a <i>testimony</i> from God and for the glory of Christ in the midst of Christianity.<a name=201:6></a> It is of the last importance that we should continually remember that brethren are a testimony and <i>nothing</i> else; that is to say, that it is the truth that has kept us for the glory of Christ, and not we ourselves.<a name=201:7></a> This is easily forgotten.<a name=201:8></a> I have particularly noticed proofs of this in Switzerland for the last six years at least.<a name=201:9></a> A late fruit from this root is, that christian conscience has become valueless from neglect of its promptings, and ceases to act.<a name=201:10></a> From this it results that brethren are feeble, and become guilty, even in matters of simple righteousness, in such a way that even the world would condemn them.<a name=201:11></a> The assemblies of God are little thought of as such, and the presence of the Lord Jesus in the assembly is forgotten and ignored.<a name=201:12></a> This is what has happened in England, but the Lord loves us too much to allow such a state of things without reminding us.<a name=201:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the test is general; it touches closely each one: that is why so many assemblies, and brethren individually in each assembly, are affected by it.<a name=201:14></a> In some cases the assembly is of one mind; in others there are two parties, more or less equal one holding on to the truth at any cost, the other thinking more of only what is on the surface; and there may be other reasons acting upon many, leading them to follow a course which seems to them more easy.<a name=201:15></a> It has always been thus.<a name=201:16></a> Lot walked a long time with Abraham without his faith being put to the test: when the time for the test came he must walk alone, and then is seen for the first time the measure of truth that he really possessed in his soul.<a name=201:17></a> This is what is happening at the present time, and no one can determine the precise moment when such and such a soul will be put to the test; and we should be wrong in forcing or hastening the test in any way whatever, and even when it is there, to suppose that every one will be tested in the same manner.<a name=201:18></a> All this is in God's hand: nevertheless when such a sifting does come, happy are they who profit by it, receiving the test as from God with searching of heart; or better, seeking to get into the presence of God that He may search it, so that all that interferes with the glory of Christ shall be judged and put away.<a name=201:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We must have patience, and help each other: a lack of patience has caused some to act too quickly, and though they acted with the best possible intentions, of separating themselves from evil, the result has been unsatisfactory.<a name=201:20></a> We are quick at seizing the reins when we see danger ahead; but the Lord knows better than we do what has to be done: in due season He will deliver all who look to Him.<a name=201:21></a> But this must be real not trying to escape the test, or to delay the time of action when the evil is clearly manifest.<a name=201:22></a> Another valuable lesson the Lord would teach us is, I think, to occupy ourselves more before Him with the state of individual consciences.<a name=201:23></a> It is easy to neglect pastoral work.<a name=201:24></a> One is inclined to act by means of outward pressure, instead of waiting for the inward action of the Spirit, who would lead the assembly by the healthy and spontaneous action of all who form part of it.<a name=201:25></a> This ought always to be the aim, but alas!<a name=201:26></a> very often it is not possible on account of a corrupt influence which has been already too active, and for too long a time, so that morally, many have become incapable of a spiritual judgment; thus division is inevitable when the test comes to the door.<a name=201:27></a> But in any case we ought to wait until God sends the test.<a name=201:28></a> A man cannot be hung because he intends to kill me.<a name=201:29></a> We must wait until the act is accomplished before taking action, doing all we can, at the same time, to raise the spiritual standard by a healthy ministry of the word, as the Lord in His grace may give us.<a name=201:30></a> Then when the test does arrive, some, at least, will be able to act according to God.<a name=201:31></a>

		The present struggle is between intelligence and the Spirit.<a name=201:32></a> It is a subtle thing which exercises the heart to its depths -- must I be guided by my intelligence according to the things that I know, or must I walk in dependence on the Lord.<a name=201:33></a> Some pretend to be an expression of the assembly of God when their acts prove that they have no sense of the Lord's presence in their midst.<a name=201:34></a> To admit their pretension, would evidently be to deny the presence and action of the Spirit of God, for such walk by human intelligence, and override conscience.<a name=201:35></a> This is what happened at Ramsgate, and a division was the result.<a name=201:36></a> All was inquired into in London, and three meetings with a week's interval were held on the subject, and every facility was given to arrive at a correct knowledge of facts, in order to come to a conclusion according to God, and this not by any preconcerted measures, plans, or arrangements, but simply through God's intervention in rather a remarkable way.<a name=201:37></a> Many .<a name=201:38></a>.<a name=201:39></a>.<a name=201:40></a> wished to set aside the decision arrived at on that occasion, and to walk in their own way: hence the reason of the present trouble.<a name=201:41></a> The principles involved I have endeavoured to shew to a certain extent.<a name=201:42></a> It is scarcely necessary for me to inform you, that the above inquiry was forced upon the assembly in London through a letter of commendation from an assembly in Kent where the difficulty arose; it was necessary to come to a decision, because all means during several months had been used to induce the opposing ones to humble themselves, but without fruit.<a name=201:43></a>

		J Dunlop, I am not a Baptist as you know, but the whole thought of baptism in the Prayer Book is equally wrong and absurd.<a name=204:1></a> It was not this brought me out but the presence of the Holy Ghost, and the unity of the body.<a name=204:2></a> But baptism is to death; no hint in scripture of giving life.<a name=204:3></a> The only connection with resurrection is Colossians 2; but it is to Christ's death.<a name=204:4></a> Regeneration is only twice used -- Matthew 19 and Titus 3: in both it is a change of position; in Matthew, the millennium; in Titus, distinguished especially from the renewing of the Holy Ghost of which we are born by the word -- the incorruptible seed of God.<a name=204:5></a>

		It is overlooked that we are baptised to something -- as to Moses, to John's baptism for the remission of sins -- that is associated with some system introduced for our blessing.<a name=204:6></a> Now forgiveness of sins is one grand feature of Christianity -- "repentance and remission of sins.<a name=204:7></a>" And the person by this door of entry, as an initial rite, is introduced into the divine sphere where these things are.<a name=204:8></a> God has been pleased to set up a system where these things are, and so when Saul became a Christian by the revelation of the Son in him, he entered by baptism into the enjoyment of this privilege.<a name=204:9></a> So it is said to save us in Peter, but guarding against attributing it to the mere rite.<a name=204:10></a> But the connection of life with it is never found in the word.<a name=204:11></a> But the English service is too ridiculous.<a name=204:12></a> It gives as a present thing by it, forgiveness of sins to an infant who has never committed any, and then has no real forgiveness by redemption at all, pretends only to governmental by absolution.<a name=204:13></a> They wash the infant's sins away who has not any, and when it has, has nothing for them -- pretends to give life withal by it of which not a trace is to be found in scripture, but is directly attributed to other things.<a name=204:14></a> Saul was baptised like others as the formal professed entrance into God's confession on earth, the institution where these things were.<a name=204:15></a> The twelve were sent to baptise the Gentiles who heretofore were strangers to it, a commission never carried out (Galatians 2), but not to circumcise them, and this from Galilee, not from heaven -- Paul, with the things to be had, not to establish that wherein they were to be had, and from a heavenly Christ.<a name=204:16></a> The Baptists have lost the scriptural truth of a place instituted of God where His blessing is, as the Jews formerly and Christendom now -- neither judged as heathen; and the Prayer Book, following Popery, puts the possession, as if the being in the place of it was that.<a name=204:17></a> Even unconverted, we are not heathen -- perhaps were, but not heathen [now], and judgment (when incurred) on a different ground.<a name=204:18></a>

		Dear Miss Pygrave, -- I answered your questions by mistake to another person who had written to me about the same thing.<a name=208:1></a> The two cases were, one in the Western States where a German (for all this is German, whose religion is characteristically for this world) began by healing his neighbours, he says -- and I had no reason to doubt it by looking to God in faith; perhaps got puffed up, and worked by Satan's power so as to lay a man, who himself told me about it, like a log on the floor, without the use of his limbs; and then it turned to a system of corruption, so that he had to flee the country for his life and said afterwards that at the end it was Satan's power.<a name=208:2></a> The other was a more reputable case: a Lutheran clergyman who used to heal persons, but connected it with all the false Lutheran doctrines of baptismal regeneration, etc.<a name=208:3></a> I knew personally the case of some really good people at Boston, where it was connected with perfectionism and higher life, falsifying and discrediting by error what is greatly wanted in the church -- to be able to say, "To me to live is Christ.<a name=208:4></a>" Dorothy Trudel never had peace, nor a plain gospel, till her death bed.<a name=208:5></a>

		But no mistakes of men take away the plain force of God's word and that He does answer the prayer of faith.<a name=208:6></a> James 5 supposes the church in order, and that those, who in a certain sense represented it, could be sent for -- where God's order was going on and His government regularly administered in the church.<a name=208:7></a> That is not the case now, but if those who are practically such, and have personally faith (that looks through the ruin to the source of good according to the order) and believe, God will still hear the prayer of faith: I do not doubt it.<a name=208:8></a> In general it is only looking for so much physical relief, generally turning aside from what is heavenly.<a name=208:9></a> There may be faith in the person also; sending for the elders supposes something of this.<a name=208:10></a> But while I fully believe there may be such answers to prayer, the books about them seem to me full of error, and, while there may be some faith as to what is physical, not calculated to edify.<a name=208:11></a> But the very prayers of the Establishment for rain, etc.<a name=208:12></a>, suppose the principle.<a name=208:13></a>

		[J G Deck] BELOVED BROTHER, -- I too have been laid aside, and in a great measure am, nor can I walk properly without an arm and a stick, nor do I preach.<a name=213:1></a> Through mercy my mind has been left clear, and I am here at my post, beset with those in person and by letter who are getting clear in our present, I might almost say our late, trials.<a name=213:2></a> God has been sifting us and it is nearly over: as I have said, we cannot halloa as those that are out of the wood, but we can see the light through the trees, and in that light there is light.<a name=213:3></a> Already it has been a real blessing to brethren; and, what is a mercy, work has gone on all the time -- gathering a little stopped in London, but not even there hindering conversions -- and a fresh spring and knitting together which there was not before.<a name=213:4></a> God is full of goodness.<a name=213:5></a> I heard from -- , and he mentioned more energy in evangelising which, with looking to God, is the real remedy .<a name=213:6></a>.<a name=213:7></a>.<a name=213:8></a> .<a name=213:9></a>

		They do not mind working on another man's foundation: an apostle could not help it, still if there be faithful devotedness and the place be really filled, God is above this danger too; if it be not filled it may be humbling, but we could not desire that God should not call these poor souls, because we were not the instruments.<a name=213:10></a> Still I have always felt it in France, where we had begun the work, an humbling thing if inroad was made on it, and that has happened where there has been a decay of spiritual energy.<a name=213:11></a> There is a government of God in these things.<a name=213:12></a> Paul had to say to such, and there is a time and a guidance when such happens: "he followeth not with us" will not do, if he preaches Christ.<a name=213:13></a>

		And now, dear brother, take courage.<a name=213:24></a> The Lord watches over us, makes <i>everything</i> work together for those who love Him -- may exercise, chasten us because He loves us; but His love is shed abroad in our hearts by His Spirit which He has given us.<a name=213:25></a> The <i>proof</i> is, Christ dying for us when sinners, pure sovereign grace doing what was needed; the power of enjoyment is, the Holy Ghost in us.<a name=213:26></a> I think you will find the "ifs" in scripture attach themselves to the journey here.<a name=213:27></a> There is an absolute finished redemption in which there is no if, but a "stand still and see the salvation of the Lord" -- a finished work and, with a short prefatory work of pure grace and divine power, it is "ye have seen .<a name=213:28></a>.<a name=213:29></a>.<a name=213:30></a> how I bare you upon eagles' wings and brought you unto myself.<a name=213:31></a>" Then they must get through the wilderness to get to Canaan.<a name=213:32></a> It is the experimental learning of what we are, and if life is not there it is just a profession, like a Christendom; but if we have life, thus we get experience, "to humble thee and to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart.<a name=213:33></a>" Here we need, not a finished work save as the basis of all, but an ever living Father and Saviour: we work out our own salvation with fear and trembling, but there we have such -- it is God that works in us.<a name=213:34></a> He gives us eternal life; we are personally known in precious grace; kept by the power of God.<a name=213:35></a> It is dependence, but on what cannot fail; an exercise of faith, perhaps, but counting on faithfulness just as sure, but by a living action, not a finished work.<a name=213:36></a> (See 1 Corinthians 1: 8) And then at the end He adds, that there may be no confusion as "at this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, what hath God wrought!<a name=213:37></a>" (Numbers 23: 23) That is a good story: go and hear Moses at the bottom of the mountain -- "stiffnecked" and "rebellious," but above, with the answer He hath not seen it: red heifer for failures, priesthood to help us along (to the) close, and then comes God's judicial estimate of what He has wrought.<a name=213:38></a> It is a blessed history, but sweet to trust Him by the way, and we need it.<a name=213:39></a>

		[P Gibbs] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- The unity of the Spirit is what occupied us at Croydon, and though I think I have it clear in my mind, I have some difficulty in making it so to others.<a name=218:1></a> The grand fact is, there is one Spirit as there is one body; not only abstractedly, but actually one, forming the body, putting each member in its place in the body; and He is the source of every proper thought and act in the church, now the fact is there.<a name=218:2></a> No doubt the end of Ephesians 2 is the great example of two made one, but then that was brought about by death and resurrection putting all on a new footing, bringing in a new state of things founded on it.<a name=218:3></a> It is of the unity of this new state of things that the Spirit is the power and characteristic.<a name=218:4></a> Now the Holy Ghost brings all these things into harmonious detail, and gives fellowship in them in that harmony; there then is the unity of the Spirit, and this may be of course in a thousand details, wherever the Spirit works.<a name=218:5></a> I do not think we can bring in verses 4-6; not that the Spirit has not to do with them, but that they are collateral subjects formed by the same Spirit.<a name=218:6></a>

Protestantism, but not having the ecclesiastical tendency, running to the end, and treated as the world; Philadelphia being neither popery nor Protestantism, but a return to divine principles, that too running on to the end that is, the Lord's coming for us; and Laodicea, being none of these but all the dissent which has sprung from Protestantism itself going on also to the end? 3.

		MY BELOVED BRETHREN<a href="#220:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>, -- I feel, in undertaking a few words here, on the one hand a great responsibility, but on the other a real joy of heart, when my mind turns towards that which, I believe, the Spirit of God calls for.<a name=220:1></a> That we have passed through a time of humiliation, pain, and exercise of heart, every one feels, no one denies.<a name=220:2></a> The state of the brethren required it, "for he doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men;" but "whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.<a name=220:3></a>" But then He does receive us -- a very great mercy and blessing.<a name=220:4></a> Think what it is to be received as His testimony and witness on the earth, poor and unworthy as we are!<a name=220:5></a> Nor, immense privilege though it be, do I speak of it, as such, as acquired privilege.<a name=220:6></a> "Ye are my witnesses," says Jehovah to Israel.<a name=220:7></a> That is the position and responsibility they were placed in.<a name=220:8></a> Every Christian is such in his place, that the life of Jesus may be manifested in their mortal bodies.<a name=220:9></a> The seven churches have been so widely introduced into this subject, that it will be well to inquire a little into their true character.<a name=220:10></a> There can be no doubt, I think, of their presenting a rapid but most perspicuous sketch of the course of Western Christendom, when through the operation of God it had come into the position of human responsibility.<a name=220:11></a> First, its full ecclesiastical character, till it comes -- after time is given it to repent -- under God's judgment; and the kingdom, and the Morning Star -- Christ in heavenly character -- are substituted for it.<a name=220:12></a> Thereupon you have a collateral picture of Protestantism running on coincidently after the Reformation, till it be rejected.<a name=220:13></a> That part of Christendom had been cleared of its Paganism, and there was much activity connected with this; but Christ had not His place in the heart of Christendom.<a name=220:14></a> It had "a name to live, but was dead.<a name=220:15></a>" It is treated as the world, and the Lord comes on it at an unexpected hour, which is the world's portion.<a name=220:16></a> Every one will have remarked the condition given in each assembly, as the ground of special blessing, "to him that overcometh.<a name=220:17></a>" But remark, it applies to the difficulties and dangers that tend to hinder faithfulness in the position in which the particular assembly finds itself.<a name=220:18></a> Some special reward may then be the recompense.<a name=220:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is more in these churches to remark, which characterises them.<a name=220:20></a> The character -- here [Philadelphia] it is Christ's holiness and truth.<a name=220:21></a> However great His love -- as it is infinite and unchangeable -- His active goodness, what characterises our knowledge of Him, is His Holiness and truth -- what we want of Him and characterises our testimony.<a name=220:22></a> This is of all moment.<a name=220:23></a> That in spite of the power of evil, He it is who holds the door open or shut as He pleases.<a name=220:24></a> This is not operation of gift and grace in the labourer, but that He can open the door of access to souls.<a name=220:25></a> But this was not all.<a name=220:26></a> In the midst of all that was going on He knew their work, and He had set before them an open door, and no man should shut it.<a name=220:27></a> His eye was on them for good.<a name=220:28></a> The testimony of grace was to be borne, and should not be hindered.<a name=220:29></a> Those who set up for traditional religion, would be forced to recognise them, and own that Christ had loved them.<a name=220:30></a> Further, the danger is not becoming Laodicean, but apostasy.<a name=220:31></a> Laodicea has its own dangers for Laodicea.<a name=220:32></a> But, through grace, they had not only kept fast hold of the believer's hope, but of Christ's patience as to its accomplishment -- "kept the word:" divine authority in that book.<a name=220:33></a> Christ, to whom all the promises belonged, and to whom it had been said, "Sit at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool," seemed to have sat very long expecting till His enemies were made so.<a name=220:34></a> But these saints waited, as He had waited, the accomplishment of the promises.<a name=220:35></a> God was not slack, but long-suffering.<a name=220:36></a> It is very remarkable to notice that Christ never puts His coming beyond the life of the person He is speaking of or to.<a name=220:37></a> The five wise and foolish virgins were the same who slept and wake: so in every case, with one exception -- which makes it stronger -- that Peter should die: but He was not speaking of His coming.<a name=220:38></a> Now, centuries have passed, generations succeeded each other, are we with present earnest desire waiting for God's Son from heaven?<a name=220:39></a> He abides God's time.<a name=220:40></a> Are we firm in hope and present faith while doing so?<a name=220:41></a> This was a condition -- not to be fulfilled, but that was -- by the faithful of Philadelphia, and they would accordingly escape the hour of temptation which would come on all the world.<a name=220:42></a> But the Lord said more, He was coming quickly, they were to hold fast what they had, that none took their crown.<a name=220:43></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What certainly chiefly characterises the saints in Philadelphia is the analogy of their position to that of Christ -- at the close of a dispensation, no apparent strength, but the door held open to Him by the porter.<a name=220:44></a> They keep His word, they do not deny His name, and specially they keep "the word of his patience.<a name=220:45></a>" The way they are identified in the glory cannot but strike every one -- blessed thing too!<a name=220:46></a> What characterises Him -- most important for us to note -- is truth and holiness: truth, and as a girdle of the loins, for it is the truth that sanctifies.<a name=220:47></a> There is no specific Laodicean characteristic in Philadelphia -- each has its own -- nor Philadelphian <i>faithfulness</i> in Laodicea.<a name=220:48></a> Each belongs to each.<a name=220:49></a> The danger we have seen was quite different.<a name=220:50></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And now, what I would beg of brethren is, not to be occupied with evil, but if the Lord has set before them an open door -- and He graciously has -- their part is to profit by it; to hold steadfastly by truth and holiness, by which Christ characterises Himself, and be ever as men that wait for their Lord, keeping the word of His patience: and God will assuredly bless them.<a name=220:51></a> It is not merely doctrine, but activity guided by doctrine, and a path formed on that of Christ.<a name=220:52></a>

		APPENDIX
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My Dear Mr Lovett, -- My mind is extremely remote from any purpose of institution, but I was led by our conversation to look into the evidences of the practice of the early church upon the subject, on the principles of which, though feeling the opportunity of instruction, I felt no doubt.<a name=225:1></a> For I cannot but feel that the religion of which we profess membership, is not an imposition of observance, a law of carnal commandments contained in ordinances (as indeed it would contradict the whole purpose and counsel of God), but an admission to privileges, exceeding great and precious promises, whereby we are made partakers of the divine nature; not merely in our hearts, but that, in respect of our consciences, no man should judge us in respect of a sabbath, or of a new moon, "which are a shadow of things to come.<a name=225:2></a>" Nor is this any licence to evil, because we are only so far become therein free, as in that we live we live unto God, for all that is in the flesh can never be free from condemnation of the law; but we as alive again from the dead, are not under the law, but made free.<a name=225:3></a> True it is that, being in the body in respect of its weakness, even to those who have received the first fruits of the Spirit, grace is ministered; also under ordinance, of which I see Christ Himself, the comprehensive centre; and, for that man is prone to go astray and not only in respect of individuals but more especially when according to the dispensation of God congregations take place, the order of righteousness must be maintained; in this respect laws must be enacted.<a name=225:4></a> Yet this is no part properly of Christianity, but the appendage of its dispensation; and even in scripture itself I distinguish between these two things.<a name=225:5></a> My mind would gladly go into the nature of precept, which it has had great delight in inquiring into, but it would be far too wide a subject to indulge in.<a name=225:6></a> However, in what I give you full leave to account a speculation if you please, I remember, though admiring that God should have afforded such apprehension to a heathen, Socrates ended where Christianity began.<a name=225:7></a> He speaks of all the appetites of his flesh as nails which fastened him down to wretchedness and misery, and speaks of death as a benefit which should deliver his soul from this; his other hopes seem to be wholly vague.<a name=225:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But if we consider the nature of the law we shall find its end to be rest from labour; the desire of entering into rest was the foundation of the hopes of the [Jewish system].<a name=225:9></a> It knew the labour of the present, and rest therefore morally was its hope; to it, therefore, the sabbath was afforded, the symbol of that rest derived from the cessation of God from the labours of creation.<a name=225:10></a> But we are admitted in some sort by hope within the veil; we know that that rest is not a resting day nor night from the undivided glorifying of the ever living God.<a name=225:11></a> This is the new life.<a name=225:12></a> To us therefore the earnest is afforded, by Him who is the resurrection, was the Author and Firstborn of the new creation, of this living rest which remaineth to the people of God, aptly signified by the Lord's day.<a name=225:13></a> Both, you see, affirmed one day as God's, the witness of His universal right; and, so far, both concur.<a name=225:14></a> But to us the mystery is far more fully revealed, and we have the Lord's day -- not a compulsory recognition of right, but the blessed pledge of our inheritance amongst the saints.<a name=225:15></a> To him therefore who refuses this, and will not recognise himself as the child of eternity, which is all God's, but will put himself under the law from the freedom of sonship; to him the Sabbath arises again, an unalterable claim of a jealous God.<a name=225:16></a> I cannot enter here into the statement of how I distinguish Christianity from all that preceded it, or is out of it, of which the Jewish system is an imputably defined covenant; but I go to what led me to write to you, to communicate to you what my books afforded me on the view which struck your mind.<a name=225:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the state of the case seems that all the East observed the Sabbath as well as Sunday; at least the observance of it was settled at the time of Athanasius, when there was, as on Sundays, communion (which, generally speaking, was on these days only), with this difference that they always stood praying on Sunday; indeed that from the first century the Ebionites always observed Saturday as well as Sunday, but they observed it as Jews.<a name=225:18></a> They commenced in the first century of Christianity, and became a distinct sect in Hadrian's time.<a name=225:19></a> The origin of its observance seems uncertain in the East; it was observed as a festival by the church except at Milan.<a name=225:20></a> As a fact it was introduced into Spain about A.<a name=225:21></a>D.<a name=225:22></a> 300 by the council of Illiberis .<a name=225:23></a>.<a name=225:24></a>.<a name=225:25></a> .<a name=225:26></a> Constantine passed a law that Christians should not work of a Sunday, except agriculturists, who were not to neglect the seasons God afforded them.<a name=225:27></a><a href="#225:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> .<a name=225:28></a>.<a name=225:29></a>.<a name=225:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I adduce these evidences of the course and practice of the church then as to the Sabbath and its nature.<a name=225:31></a> All refer the observance of Saturday to deference for the Jews for its origin.<a name=225:32></a> Augustine is the first, I find, who directs that the honours of the Jewish Sabbath should be transferred to Sunday.<a name=225:33></a><a href="#225:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a> At this time the Gallic councils forbid rural labour.<a name=225:34></a> In the sixth century early, the council of Orleans says, "Because the people are persuaded that they ought not to travel on the Lord's day with horses and men and carriages, nor prepare any victuals to eat, and use no exercise pertaining to the cleanliness of man and horse .<a name=225:35></a>.<a name=225:36></a>.<a name=225:37></a> .<a name=225:38></a> And we think they ought to abstain by which more easily coming to church they may be at leisure for prayer"; and many councils under Charlemagne, etc.<a name=225:39></a>, enforce further strictness.<a name=225:40></a> By both the Theodosiuses spectacles were prohibited on Sunday; but it will be remembered that attendance on them any day was excommunication, before the empire became christian.<a name=225:41></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the earlier councils I find only enforcement of attendance on worship; in the still earlier fathers statements of the devotional services of the Lord's day, and nothing more.<a name=225:42></a><a href="#225:f3"><sup class="footnote-link">+++</sup></a> .<a name=225:43></a>.<a name=225:44></a>.<a name=225:45></a> Gregory the Great, the author of many of our prayers, says that Antichrist will renew the observation of the Sabbath.<a name=225:46></a> I would mention here that, though Brigham himself affirms it, I do not find direct evidence of Saturday being a day of divine service in the week Tertullian has another passage to the effect of the above.<a name=225:47></a> I have given no evidence of Sunday being a day of special devotion from the beginning, as it is not questioned, but there is abundant direction.<a name=225:48></a><a href="#225:f4"><sup class="footnote-link">++++</sup></a> .<a name=225:49></a>.<a name=225:50></a>.<a name=225:51></a> I find, by the bye, both my learned compilers informing me that the Essenes (which is singular considering their general principles) only among the Jews, and the antichristian Dositheus carried the Sabbath to the excessive strictness.<a name=225:52></a> They interpreted the command of continuing where they found themselves on the entering in of the Sabbath, to their very posture.<a name=225:53></a> The Jews determined two miles to be the place where they were, and so held it lawful to travel two miles all around because they did not go out of the place where they were; how foreign to the perfect law of liberty!<a name=225:54></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I confess my apprehension of the nature of the christian Lord's day (Sabbath clearly it never was called, in scripture or anywhere else, for many centuries) would make it consistent that there would be no direction in the New Testament concerning it, and consequently little notice of it in the early fathers -- and of its actual ordinance there is abundance: notice of this seems to flow with its habit of observance.<a name=225:55></a> This no way detracts from its validity in my mind, in fact but founds it on clearer and christian ground: but I am running into the expression of my opinion, of which I would only say that I would be a Christian and not a Jew.<a name=225:56></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Socrates, the historian, says, in a long and valuable chapter, that the apostles and evangelists have by no means left the yoke of bondage on those who come to the preaching of faith but have left the feast of the Passover (he writes of Easter and other feasts) to the good disposition of those who received benefit in them; and that the observance of Jewish types is abolished.<a name=225:57></a> I do not forget that the Sabbath is in the first table as I have observed that God by His prophets identifies it with the recognition of Himself, placing it, I think, on a much higher ground than formal ordinance.<a name=225:58></a>

		In two ways it thus dwells upon, and because of this seeks, Jesus.<a name=228:13></a> [First as] the unfathomable love of God, that is of love in Himself, he learns and knows that it is this too in itself, yet not as separate from the revelation in Jesus' body, therefore the apostle adds, "Herein is love," etc.<a name=228:14></a> Secondly, that it may be brought near to familiarise and make [known] yet diminishing nought of its fulness, it is brought into intelligence in the incarnation, and death especially, of the blessed Lord Jesus our Head.<a name=228:15></a> Therefore he says, To know "the breadth and length and depth and height .<a name=228:16></a>.<a name=228:17></a>.<a name=228:18></a> that ye might be filled into (or 'unto,' that is, of what fills and its extent) all the fulness of God.<a name=228:19></a>" So, hereby know we love "because he laid down his life for us.<a name=228:20></a>" It is the stepping-stone of weakness and emptiness and necessity unto that fulness, and the resting-place of the soul, as to its natural powers, at this inexhaustible fulness of God.<a name=228:21></a> Yet this is indeed learning the heavenly, having God, the peculiar and distinctive privilege of those quickened by the Spirit, which alone gives capacity to know and fathom such a thought.<a name=228:22></a> But as a motive of conduct it is infinitely wholesome that we should feel pained at how little we reach the fulness of God (for it is in this He has acted towards us, and as Christ is the order of this towards us, so is He of it towards Him) by His Spirit, and ever seek for more full manifestations of the <i>power</i> of this in us, accompanied by simple apprehension.<a name=228:23></a>

		[J M Code, Westport] MY BELOVED BROTHER, -- I would not leave the country without a line in the Lord to you, though it has been delayed by things pressing upon me: indeed I felt I owed it for all the comfort and refreshment I got at Westport.<a name=230:4></a> It is a refreshment now to sit down and write a line simply as in the Lord, from settling controversy with heresy, and looking over papers for [the] Witness and the like, all which I suppose needful, but in which one's spirit no way flows free and blessed in Christ as when in the sphere, and so unhinderedness in principle, of one's own joys -- of Christ's joys (what a blessing to be made partakers of them -- may we -- and what holiness it requires!<a name=230:5></a>) of His sorrows, too.<a name=230:6></a> Oh, what holiness!<a name=230:7></a> for we must be partakers of the power of His resurrection in order, in the power of that holiness, to feel what sin is, and enter in love into the conflict with the power of evil, in spiritual conflict and endurance which Christ's Spirit has according to where He has been and where He is -- in us according to where He is, where we are, and also for sympathy and comfort where He was.<a name=230:8></a> It always or love in holiness, brings us into deep conflict, a holy conflict which can be carried on only in sympathy and intercourse with Him, whence indeed and where it flows: its result may be happiness, perhaps peace, and patience.<a name=230:9></a> Patience in the hall and before Judas was conflict in Gethsemane: it was gone through with the Father there.<a name=230:10></a> Only that as Christ could say, "The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me," so we, as far as we walk in the Spirit, will and ought to say, to Christ with whom we are one, The reproaches of them that reproached Thee have fallen on me.<a name=230:11></a> Then we must, like Him in some measure, take care to be faithful witnesses, "The spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you.<a name=230:12></a>" Oh, if we could be much alone with Him, what fruit might we say would flow!<a name=230:13></a>

		Do not faint, dear brother, for if we really labour we must be more or less in conflict, trial, and sorrow; for it is a work of faith, if a labour of love and patience of hope; because though blessed fruits be by the way, and we may see them ripening, it is the great in-gathering is the time of joy.<a name=230:21></a> And it is a distinct view and reference to that that gives our work a real deep holy character, such as His was, and will prove real in that day.<a name=230:22></a> You must labour in sorrow, for it is in the midst of evil, if you would reap in joy; and if we get our corn up into shocks, still it is unprotected out in the field, and we have the watchful care and anxiety till it is housed, though we may rejoice sometimes in a fine day while going on.<a name=230:23></a> I pray the Lord to be abundantly with you, and sustain your soul in patient abounding labour towards Him to whom we owe so much.<a name=230:24></a> My love to all the saints, and the whole church.<a name=230:25></a> I had an interesting journey from Athlone with two who discussed and entered into all things fully .<a name=230:26></a>.<a name=230:27></a>.<a name=230:28></a> .<a name=230:29></a> Watching over the saints I feel a very primary thing.<a name=230:30></a> Ever, dear brother, with many prayers that you may be blessed and stedfast with all the saints.<a name=230:31></a>

		The remembrance of it is extremely precious to me, and that has been to me, dear brethren, of great blessing, and by the Spirit of God who acts in me, I feel often at my dear Geneva amongst you, while blessing God with all my heart for the testimony of His love, which He has given me in the love of you all, my dear brethren, and my heart expands in thinking of the ties which His goodness has established between you all and my feeble heart.<a name=232:6></a> You do not know how it has opened my heart, and how I found the grace of God in my visit to the brethren of Geneva; and I find my joy again in beginning to write this letter.<a name=232:7></a> A stranger previously, and for the most part unknown, I found a welcome which was the manifestation of the operation of the Holy Spirit, and one is always happy when one finds oneself in subjection at the work of God.<a name=232:8></a>

		I will communicate to you news of us, dear brethren, persuaded that you will take interest in it.<a name=232:9></a> Our dear brother -- will have communicated to you something of this.<a name=232:10></a> Our meeting, where I was able to work in public almost for the first time since my return, has been I believe of great blessing There was a spirit of love and of confidence and of liberty; which always flows from this, which struck even our enemies who were present, and which acted powerfully upon those who there took part.<a name=232:11></a> There were a great number of brethren, instructed ones of all classes, a hundred and more from nearly all parts of England and from Ireland.<a name=232:12></a> We should have much wished to see some of our Swiss brethren, but God orders all these things.<a name=232:13></a> Besides this kindling of love, and the communications of their light among the brethren, and these communings (so sweet) of brotherly love making us anticipate the great congregation which will assemble itself around the Lamb, the direct action, actually manifested, of the meeting was rather upon those who were not of the Anglican establishment.<a name=232:14></a> Several deacons who had left their society as not being based upon the word, were much strengthened and confirmed; there was a Presbyterian minister and an Independent fully convinced that their position was false, and they have both acted since in accordance with their convictions.<a name=232:15></a> This will produce much more effect in these countries than if it were an Anglican who had left his parish, and will bring out more into light what we seek, and, whatever feebleness there may be, the gathering together of the church of the living God and not any sect, and that we are not opposed to such or such a sect, in particular; and this is what already has taken place, for the report of it has been spread in the two most populous parts of England, namely, London and Lancashire.<a name=232:16></a> However, that does not as yet come to much; God only knows what the result will be.<a name=232:17></a> It will be, at least, of Him, for we are very feeble, whether as to the number of brethren or as to the number of ministers.<a name=232:18></a> So much the better, in a sense.<a name=232:19></a> But there is a great movement, though much hidden, among dissenters: those whom I have met, dare not defend their system by the word, and I hear everywhere that they confess constantly in private that there is something bad in their state somewhere; that is indeed the state of all the systems here, stronger outwardly and more active than ever, but all on the quicksands, and trembling within.<a name=232:20></a> What I remark is, that they are more openly attached to the world, and act consequently more openly for their private interests, whether established or dissenting.<a name=232:21></a> It is God alone who can withdraw His own from the judgment which must come upon the world.<a name=232:22></a> I feel it more and more each day; with much external display, the Establishment becomes every day more popish, the dissenters more feeble.<a name=232:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As for ourselves, our meeting has been, by the grace of our God, in very great blessing.<a name=232:24></a> All have felt it, more than any previous meeting.<a name=232:25></a> Its character was a little different.<a name=232:26></a> We were more in public, and there were other circumstances.<a name=232:27></a> God continues, my brethren, to bless our little flocks.<a name=232:28></a> They have much increased in Ireland since my leaving, and are walking happily in love; it is only, however, a small thing: the enmity against them increases greatly every day.<a name=232:29></a> Their conduct, however, from that which I hear, produces effect, gathers strength in the consciences of those who surround them in several places.<a name=232:30></a> In England also there are several flocks recently formed, as that which -- visited at Hereford, whence I write; and a great increase in the numbers of brethren in the North (Cumberland), and I am invited this week to visit Edinburgh, where thirty-six are gathered together.<a name=232:31></a> As to our churches formed longer ago, several have also been increased since my going away, and there have been in several parts several conversions, insomuch that (although in great feebleness) we ought to thank God for what He is doing.<a name=232:32></a> Still, as in Ireland, the enmity both of Anglicans and dissenters increases also.<a name=232:33></a> It is what the children of God must always expect, "Ye know that the world hath hated me before it hated you," the Lord says.<a name=232:34></a>

		You see, dear brethren, I have believed that you would take interest in all that concerns us, as I do in all that concerns you, as if I were amongst you, as I have been, with my heart fully occupied and blessed, so many times.<a name=232:35></a> May God, who is good, who alone can establish and strengthen us by His grace and His power, be constantly with you, and may His presence be powerfully felt, dear brethren, amongst you.<a name=232:36></a> Be united, closely united, united in that charity which is the bond of perfectness.<a name=232:37></a> No blessing without that; nothing will be lacking where love abounds.<a name=232:38></a> Perhaps we are not perfected in the order in which we are, as to ourselves here.<a name=232:39></a> I am persuaded that we are very far from perfection.<a name=232:40></a> The only thing which would give me fear for our brethren here would be to see a high idea of themselves, and satisfaction in their present state beginning to rise up among them; for when I compare this state with the Bible, I find such a distance, although we are, and we ought to be, deeply thankful for what God has given us and shewn.<a name=232:41></a> But if there are imperfections it is love and union which will prevent their bad effects, and which will give room to weigh circumstances and to find the remedies that the word of God can furnish to spiritual wisdom; at least that love is the bond of perfectness.<a name=232:42></a> I pray God with all my heart that you may be united in heart and in the practices of brotherly love which so much nourishes that love, and that your ties may be strengthened and drawn closer by the Spirit of God, bound fast together in the strength of our eternal union with Christ, and in the strength of the grace which flows like the precious oil poured on the head of Aaron, and which went down unto the skirts of his garments.<a name=232:43></a> If I may further, dear brethren, express the wishes of my heart for you, it is that you may be large-hearted towards all Christians, and rigid in discipline towards yourselves; a discipline, nevertheless, of love.<a name=232:44></a> We are priests, I believe, to separate that which is pure and impure it is true, but to discern, to purify, and to <i>restore</i>; to wash each other's feet -- not judges of what is not of God.<a name=232:45></a>

		BELOVED BROTHER, -- A little more leisure enables me to take up my pen to write to you, having long had your letter lying on my table for that purpose.<a name=237:1></a> I know not, but I have a little lingered in my energies or I should have been out of this before now; as it is, with what I have to do I shall hardly be in England before the winter is passed.<a name=237:2></a> The Lord however knows, but it seems to me -- and yet who knows what the morrow brings forth?<a name=237:3></a> -- that certain duties lie before me in -- .<a name=237:4></a> There is considerable blessing in certain portions of the work, but in all the older Christians a certain languor seems to pervade.<a name=237:5></a> I know not, alas!<a name=237:6></a> whether I ought not to class myself among the number.<a name=237:7></a> It is not that I have not laboured plenty; but labour, and labour of faith or love is quite a different thing.<a name=237:8></a> The Lord fill us with His own Spirit.<a name=237:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Your letter, beloved friend, left the hope in my heart that you might have gone about and visited many places, whatever your centre or Antioch might have been; since then much time has elapsed, and many circumstances.<a name=237:10></a> Lately I have received more than one letter speaking to me of the propagation of Plymouth views, one adding that you had yielded.<a name=237:11></a> Whatever the first effect, my soul was with the Lord about them, so as to enjoy perfect peace.<a name=237:12></a> I trust His love.<a name=237:13></a> I feel more distrust of myself, still I trust in Him that <i>He</i> will be with me in all my ways as to it.<a name=237:14></a> But the subject is one of sorrow to me.<a name=237:15></a> As to mere details of prophecy my mind is quite open, nor do I find that difference of view, when the view is kept open towards Christ, hinders the fullest sympathy in service.<a name=237:16></a> But I do feel the position of Plymouth in the testimony of the latter day is completely changed.<a name=237:17></a> It was the power of union and brotherly love, the Philadelphian spirit, which stood as a burning bush in the church; and this was a distinct and positive testimony; as poor dear -- said of you, Get into that slough of love at Plymouth and you are lost.<a name=237:18></a> Various portions of light and truth might be furnished by different brethren, and supposing difference or mistake, they dwelt together in unity and were glad to communicate to each other their thoughts even that they might be corrected; and progress was made in the truth.<a name=237:19></a> But this has, if not absolutely, all as one disappeared; a hard and rigid dogmatism of view has entirely replaced it: nor am I aware of any one place where the views adopted at Plymouth have been the means of gathering the saints, though they have been propagated in many gatherings, and this is not an unimportant feature to my mind and worthy of your study.<a name=237:20></a> I do not say that there is no love at Plymouth: there is in many a Wesleyan or dissenting church within.<a name=237:21></a> But Plymouth has ceased to represent this: it represents an opinion, and, alas!<a name=237:22></a> yet -- is not conscious of what an immense FALL this is, but rather glories in it.<a name=237:23></a> If a strange Christian or a brother from another place were to go there, the consequence would be, not that he would find the testimony of the power of love in union and the truth delighted in and sought out, but that he would be instantly subjected to a process of imbruing his mind with certain views.<a name=237:24></a> Alas!<a name=237:25></a> how sorrowful!<a name=237:26></a> and as I have said -- not to be aware of what a dreadful fall this is.<a name=237:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To me the testimony once rendered was the proof needed in the church of the presence of the Spirit: comparatively, a view of the details of prophecy was absolutely nothing, and the assiduity of their propagation a moral evil; but that I pass over.<a name=237:28></a> I have seen some of the statements, such as the manuscript letters once circulated, much of which were even contradictory, and some things to my mind absurd.<a name=237:29></a> Patiently proposed they would have been the subject of gracious consideration and separation of true and false.<a name=237:30></a> But this is not the style of the instruction.<a name=237:31></a> Of the future that this holds out I do not pretend to judge: whether the Lord means to sink the testimony into the general mass, and so annihilate it, and have views as the only result; or raise up a new one by the determinate action of His Spirit -- of this I know nothing, but I have the most perfect and entire confidence in His fidelity and love, so that I am entirely happy as to it looking simply to Him.<a name=237:32></a> I trust to be enabled by Him to walk abidingly near Him in respect of this, for I doubt not His fidelity.<a name=237:33></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If I know my own heart I am not anxious for an opinion: I feel assured that the doctrine of the church is lost in this teaching.<a name=237:34></a> This I think serious, but I am ready to hear everything; but the more I study the more I see (and it has greatly increased in clearness to me lately) this doctrine overlooked, or unknown, or obscured in their views.<a name=237:35></a> God's teaching is not to me doubtful on this.<a name=237:36></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have not read all, but I am perfectly assured that the papers on the Revelation are based on an entirely false interpretation of Psalm 110: the basis is all false; but I desire to learn onward myself for the service of the precious church of God, and to move not a thought or a word in all patience but as He shews it to be for the service of the church of God -- His service, when it is His will, as well as if it is His will; for power is with Him and blessing as well as truth.<a name=237:37></a> The point important to me in truth is the loss of the doctrine of the church; in this I have no doubt that I am taught of God as far as I have gone, however much I may have yet to learn -- alas!<a name=237:38></a> how much!<a name=237:39></a> but my desire is unity in love.<a name=237:40></a> God knows how long this is to last, or if St.<a name=237:41></a> Paul's sighs are to be ours also.<a name=237:42></a> At any rate, His will be done: as yet something of it subsists -- at any rate in some parts where there is as much difference of opinion, but where brethren are more valued than an opinion.<a name=237:43></a> Peace be with you, beloved brother.<a name=237:44></a> My soul is in singular peace as to all this, though not without grave and serious thoughts; for we are in serious times.<a name=237:45></a> I trust my love is not diminished but increased, but I feel more and more the Lord's servant, and so of the brethren.<a name=237:46></a> He that is nearest to Christ will best serve Him, and there is no serving Him without it.<a name=237:47></a> The principle of anticlericalism is making way in and through all that is active for the truth, even where there is notable opposition to them that have been in testimony to it.<a name=237:48></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Love to all the brethren very tenderly in the Lord.<a name=237:49></a> May His abundant grace be shed upon and penetrate their hearts, and all holiness of conversation abound so that His Spirit may be free amongst them.<a name=237:50></a> Peace, peace be with them and His presence: my desire is brotherly love.<a name=237:51></a>

		BELOVED BROTHER, -- I reply at once to your letter.<a name=239:1></a> I did receive your letter, which lay a good while on my table from constant occupation both of writing and ordinary service at Geneva, where I spent two months.<a name=239:2></a> I enter into and enjoy the first part of your present letter and profit by the connection of the passages with the seventh; as to the latter part, it is remarkable that the question you put had occupied me independently of these questions in a particular manner for a good while back and I had added a long note to a tract on Romans 11<a href="#239:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> on other points which discussions here had given rise to, and I feel that I brought out the point very precisely.<a name=239:3></a> And it is precisely on this point, much more clear than heretofore in my mind, that I feel that Plymouth has lost, or for the most part never has attained, the idea which seems to me essential to the church -- that is, which essentially distinguishes it in its privileges.<a name=239:4></a> I knew that the system which prevails there placed the church on the same ground as Israel in the millennium, and it was one of the things which convinced me that the notion of the church was <i>entirely wanting</i>.<a name=239:5></a> Israel will have many things which we have, but had not all that which distinguishes the church -- those who have prohlpivkasi "pre-trusted in Christ," (Ephesians 1: 12.<a name=239:6></a>) Israel believes when they see, but "blessed are they who have not seen, and yet have believed.<a name=239:7></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But my answer to your question, Has the church any spiritual things which it has not received through Israel?<a name=239:8></a> is -- ALL <i>that is properly essential to it as the church</i>.<a name=239:9></a> The church can be looked at as coming in under the promises and grafted in on the spiritual things of Israel, but it is only the lowest form in which those who compose the church can be considered (nor is it then ever called the church that I am aware of) and only in respect of its administration down here; and in this point of view it will terminate and be cut off to make place for something else.<a name=239:10></a> But is that all the idea we are to have of the church, and are those who believe in Christ, when He is not seen, in no different position from those who believe in Him when He is seen?<a name=239:11></a> Is union with Christ when He is <i>hid in God</i> the same thing as belonging to Him when He is seen in the exercise of judgment in the earth?<a name=239:12></a> Though His life [be theirs] the knowledge of Christ is quite other, as well as the position of the faithful.<a name=239:13></a> Will they suffer with Christ; are they conformed to His death having the fellowship of His sufferings; are there no sympathies, no knowledge of Christ which is connected with this which cannot exist when He is reigning?<a name=239:14></a> Even the very term Son has a different force here; when God sets forth His Son as King in Zion, He calls on the kings of the earth to kiss Him, and gives as basis of the [decree] which places Him there that He is His Son; "this day have I begotten thee.<a name=239:15></a>" Is this the way we know the Son?<a name=239:16></a> I admit the truth of what is stated at Plymouth.<a name=239:17></a> The evil is this, that all the higher part of truth is left out, and everything which expresses it reduced to this level.<a name=239:18></a> Does "To us a son is born, to us a king is given" satisfy the desires of your heart in your knowledge of Christ?<a name=239:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And now let me take up certain expressions which bring this out.<a name=239:20></a> You speak of union with Christ risen: well, it is clear that it is with Christ risen, and not with Christ alive after the flesh or in the grave, that I am united.<a name=239:21></a> But I do not believe the scripture ever speaks of union with Christ risen simply as our portion; at least it is not what is habitually set forward as the acme of the glory.<a name=239:22></a> We are <i>set down</i> in heavenly places in Him -- will the Jews be that in the millennium?<a name=239:23></a> Our life is hid <i>with Him</i> in God -- will He be hid in God in that day?<a name=239:24></a> The fact is that the highest privileges of the church are no matter, not merely of Israel's spiritual privileges, but of promises at all; because union with the Son of God one with the Father is no part of promise, but the basis of a mystery hidden from ages and generations, which gives a body to Christ independent of all question of Israel and Gentile, which knows the Son of God as its source above all distinction of Israel and Gentile.<a name=239:25></a> In the administration of the promises, I find Jew first and then Greek -- in the church, neither Jew nor Greek; in the administration of the promises, I find Gentiles grafted in who were a wild olive, and natural branches never grafted in at all: but all this relates to the administration of promises here below so that I find the seed of Abraham in the church, the Gentiles fellow-heirs and partakers of His promise in Christ.<a name=239:26></a> But I know not where union with the Son of God is promised, where to be loved by the Father as the Son is loved is promised, the result of which is to give us a place with Him in the kingdom -- the immense privilege of suffering with Him now, to see Him as He is, to be like Him.<a name=239:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If it be answered that this will be the result, after the millennium, for Israel during the millennium, I answer: first, there is no such revelation in the word; and secondly, it cannot be, because the Son will have given up the kingdom and be subject that <i>God</i> may be all in all; and further, the distinction of Jews and Gentiles is kept up in the millennium, so that there can be no body of Christ, nor the Spirit, or consciousness in their relationships of the body of Christ which depends on <i>union with Him hidden in heaven</i> in virtue of a life which in its power, thus revealed in heaven, knows neither Jew nor Gentile.<a name=239:28></a> I do not recognise that resurrection shuts out distinction between Jew and Gentile (though there be in it the power of a life which does, when its full result is revealed), for "the sure mercies of David" are founded on it -- but the church union with Christ hid in God does.<a name=239:29></a> If you examine the epistle of St.<a name=239:30></a> Peter writing to the Jews he never names the church; indeed St.<a name=239:31></a> Paul alone does.<a name=239:32></a> St.<a name=239:33></a> Peter sees Jesus to the cloud, and sees Him when He is [manifested] out of the cloud again -- St.<a name=239:34></a> Paul only in heaven and the church united to Him there, to Him who said, "Why persecutest thou me?<a name=239:35></a>" St.<a name=239:36></a> Paul Justifies in its administration by the prophets, a system whose principle and root was above all that they had said.<a name=239:37></a> Union with a Saviour hid in God formed no part of the revelation committed to them, nor of the promises made to Abraham though those who have this union are heirs of the promises because one with Him who is so.<a name=239:38></a> But union with a Saviour hid in God, the Son one with the Father Himself, so that we are one body with Him, of His flesh and of His bones, is of the essence of the church; and I cannot see that this forms a part of Israel's privileges in the millennium, for then there could not be Jews, and Gentiles their servants and dependants.<a name=239:39></a> They will enjoy the fruits of His resurrection, but they cannot be said to be risen with Him; they will enjoy the results of His having gone and received the kingdom from the Father but they will not be sitting in heavenly places in Him, for He is not there.<a name=239:40></a>

		In a word, all that is distinctive to the church is lost in this system, for that which is distinctive to it is not the subject of promise; though the church is heir by her union with Christ of the promises which are in Him as the true seed of Abraham; for "to Abraham and his seed were the promises made.<a name=239:41></a>" But is that all?<a name=239:42></a> Where is the promise which conveys to me, "In that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you?<a name=239:43></a>" And even in administration, when all things are united in one head in Christ for the administration of the fulness of times it cannot be added for them "in whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things, after the counsel of his own will.<a name=239:44></a>" These words are the Spirit's contrast of the church -- "that we should be to the praise of his glory," etc.<a name=239:45></a> Many, many are the consequences which flow from this: to be ignorant of it may be loss, but to set it aside -- I will not say oppose it -- is more than loss.<a name=239:46></a> I can only give you the outline of the principle.<a name=239:47></a> It is a matter of faith and divine teaching which God gives according to His sovereign goodness; but if this be a part of the glory of Christ, the privilege of the church, and the glory of God in the church throughout all ages, it is a serious thing that Christ should, in the minds of saints, be shorn of it, and their condition, and consequently their affections, reduced to those of Israel in the latter day, and deprived of Christ as He is given to the church.<a name=239:48></a> That is where I see the evil, and I trust, carry it to God.<a name=239:49></a> I rejoice in all the joy and blessing of the saints, and I trust that a true apprehension of the relationship between Christ and the church will be manifested in holy and patient love, that others may profit by it if so it be.<a name=239:50></a> May the abounding of the Lord's peace and grace be with all the brethren.<a name=239:51></a> "The wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated .<a name=239:52></a>.<a name=239:53></a>.<a name=239:54></a> without partiality and without hypocrisy; and the fruits of righteousness are sown in peace to them that make peace.<a name=239:55></a>"

		MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I hardly know how to give you any answer without going into a long detail of evil that I shrink from when needless, otherwise than by stating to you what I stated to the meeting when I left.<a name=243:1></a> I do not know whether you are aware that Mr.<a name=243:2></a> Harris, though he did not leave communion, declines further ministry, and proposes leaving Plymouth.<a name=243:3></a> I stated that practically I felt God was displaced -- that was the general ground.<a name=243:4></a> I then stated three things: subverting the principles of our meeting; evil and unrighteousness unconfessed and unjudged; and the refusal to re-establish a certain Friday meeting where anything occurred was considered, so that the means of remedy were cut off -- this had been sought previously, and the proposal entirely slighted.<a name=243:5></a> I expressed my love to all and value for many, that I believed the great body quite innocent in it, but that there was one Table and one bread, and that they were therefore responsible, and as I felt so myself I could not identify myself any longer with the evil I knew.<a name=243:6></a> I did not go into any details then; since, I did, on the demand of a large body, but stated only what had led to my leaving though, alas, much more was known to me.<a name=243:7></a> The great body have felt Harris's leaving very much; he was the only one (brother) who visited the poor.<a name=243:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The evil was both in the assembly and in individuals, and in individuals leading and taking a prominent part -- I judge positive actual evil, and it seems to me of a very sad tendency.<a name=243:9></a> I have great peace since I left, only doubting very much whether I should not have done better to have left before, when I first thought and spoke of it.<a name=243:10></a> It may have made my way clearer, but only by the most sad means of much more individual evil, and grievous evil in the public assembly.<a name=243:11></a> At any rate, patience has been had.<a name=243:12></a> I think they are comfortable at the results, but I see no softening of heart or repentance in those who have been leading it on -- indeed much evil in many.<a name=243:13></a> Such is all the sad tale I have to tell you; to enter into all the details would only make you miserable and me, too, and I am not aware that it would do any one any good; publishing evil of others is seldom glorifying God.<a name=243:14></a> Kindest love to all.<a name=243:15></a>

		Dearest Alex Ord, -- It is to know where the marks are not, not where they are, which is difficult.<a name=244:1></a> Compare Acts 2 and 4 and see; though I admit that did not last long.<a name=244:2></a> The great yet simple secret is the presence of the Holy Ghost in the body being lost as to power (for He is there), disowned.<a name=244:3></a> The ruin then shews itself in various ways, leaning on human wisdom; leaning on clerical importance to give decency and credit to the world; so that it can join the church without suffering or the cross; leaning on particulars, "I am of Paul," etc.<a name=244:4></a>, for schisms in the early church were not separations.<a name=244:5></a> I suspect the first separation to have been a godly, though an ill-formed thing, that of Novatus; corruption drove him to it, but he had enough of corrupt principles, or habits rather, in his mind, to go wrong in the formal ground of separation; the incapacity to discern the working of the enemy; the having ceased to expect the Lord; not merely divisions but the scattering of the sheep, so that they are not in any division at all, but in the world (Satan's place) alone.<a name=244:6></a> Scattering I think much stronger than division: "he catcheth the sheep and scattereth them.<a name=244:7></a>" Nay worse, the building up of immense worldly systems with perhaps some sheep in them, hidden, and starved often too, and calling these immense systems the church; setting up Satan in it as in popery, or selling what they pretend to be the bride of Christ, and where many of Christ's sheep are, to kings and princes for money; yea seeking them, as Jeremiah reproaches Judah, instead of their seeking it.<a name=244:8></a> Is not this ruin?<a name=244:9></a> Say a few of us have escaped and fled out.<a name=244:10></a> Why so?<a name=244:11></a> Because it was all ruin.<a name=244:12></a> The denial of the Spirit would be found in the denial of gifts, or in gifts denying the body, no matter which, for the Holy Ghost is in both.<a name=244:13></a> But ruin is found in this that the church, such as God formed and fashioned it, <i>does not exist at all</i> save as He sanctions two or three meeting in the name of Jesus.<a name=244:14></a> When this is done, if it be in the spirit of the unity of the whole body (woe to them if it is not) the Lord will be there.<a name=244:15></a> I am not uneasy about a hundred meetings; they broke bread from house to house.<a name=244:16></a> If it were separating in heart from brethren, or a fleshly spirit of self-will or self-importance, or excluded any saints really walking as such, then of course it would be evil; and a spiritual person would find it out the first day; but, if in unity and love, twenty meetings in a town are all one to me.<a name=244:17></a> I like small gatherings provided they are really in the unity of the Spirit.<a name=244:18></a> The brethren may come to need them yet.<a name=244:19></a> Great power, I believe, would bring them; little power needs them.<a name=244:20></a> It is clear self-importance or chagrin may set them up without God; but that which has brought in the ruin I believe to be moral.<a name=244:21></a> "All seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's"; "All men forsook me.<a name=244:22></a>" "All they which are in Asia are turned away from me" -- not from Christ absolutely, but they would not go the whole path of faith with the apostle; they feared the cross, the rough and unseemly road the Spirit of God led them.<a name=244:23></a> The world had come in in the shape of ease and respectability; it is the first form which the devil puts on, for it is order and comeliness for the flesh; but it is the world and Satan, hence power is wanting for the purpose of resisting the other forms, heresy (in opinion) and clericalism; and the vessel of power becomes obnoxious because his standard troubles the conscience, instead of his spiritual power acting on the heart as well (for when the former is reached in a Christian, and not the latter, he kicks against it) and the church goes its own way into the hands of Satan in a worldly clerical road.<a name=244:24></a> Wise was God indeed to choose not many mighty, not many noble, not many rich; they find it hard to submit their comforts and comeliness to God's.<a name=244:25></a> A rich body of Christians will become practically poor and simple, or practically worldly.<a name=244:26></a> Such is my thought said in haste.<a name=244:27></a>

		The ruin I see how none can deny; our feelings in it are a further question because they depend on our sympathies with Christ, and that is spiritual power.<a name=244:28></a> Every one would not [have] wept over Jerusalem even though not going with its guilt.<a name=244:29></a> I judge that dwelling on divisions marks a very feeble estimate of the state of ruin the church is in, but if it be not a name for acquiescence in evil, which is an abomination, I hail every apprehension of the truth.<a name=244:30></a> Whatever the door of approach, once in the truth by divine teaching, it will be perceived on every side as men grow in the conscience of what the church is.<a name=244:31></a> For where is the bride of Christ, His beautiful flock which He gave us?<a name=244:32></a> But, I judge, divisions are rather falsely apprehended, for what are called such in scripture were not separations, but divisions in spirit, etc.<a name=244:33></a>, among those united; separation there was none but of abandoners of Christianity.<a name=244:34></a> I remember the text alarming me on quitting the Establishment, "They went out from us because they were not of us," till I said, To be sure, because I was not of them; that is just the truth, and I would not be.<a name=244:35></a>

		Edward Foley, I do not judge temperance societies to be good or scriptural, because they impose another law, and give other motives and other obligations, than scripture or the doctrines of Christ give, and though in particular instances where followed with an unfeigned desire for good, God may have in sovereign mercy overruled them for good (as I dare say may have been the case), yet their general moral effect has been harmful, as all unscriptural things must be.<a name=246:1></a> But this is not the ground I go on here, though it is a monstrous thing to substitute an unscriptural invention of man for the institution of God, in a matter which, as to institutions, forms the central expression of the christian system.<a name=246:2></a> Further, I think all vows or undertakings of this kind to be positive sin: and am I really to give up the scriptural remembrance of Christ to support a system whose basis I believe to be really (though unwittingly) a sin?<a name=246:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But what is the character of the act?<a name=246:4></a> It is not respecting the scruples of others, and leaving them free to act on them, even if seeking to enlighten them, but it is claiming to impose a law instituted by man on the whole church of God, a law which they cannot pretend to see in scripture.<a name=246:5></a> This is not respecting individual conscience, nor could I tolerate that the institution of Christ should be subordinated or made to vary for the fancies of men.<a name=246:6></a> It is not a question of a certain number at -- , who may perhaps have no very clear idea of the importance of the question.<a name=246:7></a> You are changing the institution of Christ for the whole church of God, if indeed in principle you count yourselves one body with it, and imposing unscriptural inventions on the whole body of Christ.<a name=246:8></a> Supposing other Christians to come to -- who have clear enough judgment to condemn morally the whole notion and principle of temperance societies, and who felt scandalized at the institutions of Christ being subjected to the inventions and vows of men, what are they to do?<a name=246:9></a> I avow to you I would not break bread where I saw Christ's order (in a most touching part of His service too) made the sport of man's inventions.<a name=246:10></a> It is the very idea of the dishonour done to the Lord's institution which offends me: the acquiescence of twenty or thirty saints in -- , dear as they may be to me, could not affect that.<a name=246:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To me, therefore, I avow to you, it is intolerable: I mean the pretension <i>to subject the whole church of God</i> (for, let it be well weighed, that is what it amounts to) to a notion which is not or cannot be pretended to be a rule of scripture, and which I judge to be sinful in its very nature, and to subject the institution of Christ to it.<a name=246:12></a> I judge Christians ought not to break bread where it is knowingly done.<a name=246:13></a>

		[J Lakeman?<a name=248:1></a>] BELOVED BRETHREN, -- I have no intention of commenting on the proceedings in the case of poor Mr.<a name=248:2></a> Morris, as I never had any part in it, and believe that the enemy and not the Spirit of God was working in the whole matter; but as some one has sent me "A Letter addressed," etc.<a name=248:3></a> (I do not know who), I felt desirous to make a remark to you, beloved brethren, whose names are appended to it, as to all who concur, though there be but one to whom I am known after the flesh, and present to you a very important principle which seems to me involved in the statement you have made -- or, at least, leaves it in a dangerous uncertainty: that union in "faith in the blood of Christ, the Son of the living God," is to become a kind of allowance of error in those who may claim fellowship on that ground.<a name=248:4></a> This principle, I judge, it is of all importance to repudiate.<a name=248:5></a> Whatever means may be used, I am bound to see that no man fail of the grace of God, and that there be no root of bitterness, whether it be manifested in doctrine that alienates from God, or in any carnal workings.<a name=248:6></a> I should fail in charity towards humble, simple souls did I not.<a name=248:7></a> Heresy is a work of the flesh, as other grosser things, and surely has to be checked: words may eat, as doth a canker.<a name=248:8></a> Errors are often found to affect fundamental truth which many a simple saint may not perceive to do so.<a name=248:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another thing I apprehend sorrowful in your paper; you appear at least to excuse the doctrine, and you lay as a basis of this, that the only sense in which it would be said to affect the doctrine of the cross is asserting that there is another way of obtaining pardon of sin besides the death of the Lord Jesus.<a name=248:10></a> Do you think, then, that Satan will always declare his object?<a name=248:11></a> This is surely most dangerous ground to take.<a name=248:12></a> Supposing it was said that the Divinity of Christ was not necessary seeing suffering was not eternal -- an argument, I apprehend, difficult to answer -- or for whatever other reason; would that not affect the doctrine of the cross?<a name=248:13></a> An inefficient atonement is as bad as another.<a name=248:14></a> I use the word suffering instead of punishment, because it seems to me that the word punishment is used a little equivocally; and that to call eternal punishment where the punished person no longer exists is something very like evasion.<a name=248:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What pains me is that you seek to justify the doctrine or excuse it, and not merely to blame the conduct of certain parties as to Mr.<a name=248:16></a> Morris.<a name=248:17></a> Degrees in punishment do not do away to my mind with what we mean by infinite punishment, no more than degrees of glory with infinite bliss.<a name=248:18></a> You give out a deliberate opinion and commit the whole of the meeting to it, not that M.<a name=248:19></a> was ill-treated, but that his doctrine does not affect directly, or undermine, the value of the cross or of the Person, work, or blood-shedding of our blessed Lord and Saviour.<a name=248:20></a> He who communicates with you must do so on the footing of accepting this theological statement -- at least, that he is bound also to accept all such, and hold full communion anywhere and everywhere with Mr.<a name=248:21></a> M.<a name=248:22></a>, and any others who receive and publicly propagate this doctrine.<a name=248:23></a> This is a very serious position you have taken.<a name=248:24></a> It effectually identifies you with M.<a name=248:25></a> and his doctrine.<a name=248:26></a> For if it does not directly nor indirectly affect that, and you pronounce him guiltless in holding it, you oblige communion with those holding it and teaching it.<a name=248:27></a> It is not, you say, connected with faith in Him: an astonishing statement, as I know of no truth that is not.<a name=248:28></a> If any person is convinced that your theology is wrong, and that the wonted doctrine of Christians is to be maintained, and resistance distinctly to be made to the view in question, or that seeking followers for it is heresy, you exclude them completely from your communion: because that serious error and truth are to be on the same terms in communion is a principle insupportable in the church of God.<a name=248:29></a> You affirm it is not important, hence nothing ought to be done.<a name=248:30></a> You will find it hard to convince the great body of Christians of it.<a name=248:31></a> And indifference to error makes truth no truth at all.<a name=248:32></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I say nothing of the excommunication, as you well know I could have nothing to say to it; and I see in your tract the expression of that of which I have been long conscious -- the result of what all know I have considered a work of Satan elsewhere.<a name=248:33></a> But I look to the goodness of God, dear brethren, to set it all right: His power is above all the workings of the enemy.<a name=248:34></a> I have never been at in my life, and it is very possible never may, but as your letter was sent to me, I should have failed in faithfulness and in love, too, if I had not communicated with those who have signed it, and with all the brethren adhering to it.<a name=248:35></a> It is not a blame of the excommunication, but a theological judgment on the doctrine as a ground of the reception of persons teaching it.<a name=248:36></a> You have committed the meeting to the doctrine being harmless and blameless.<a name=248:37></a> I only want to press this fact, beloved brethren, on your consciences before God, and that you may consider the position in which it places yourselves and others.<a name=248:38></a> Though I address my letter necessarily to one, I shall feel thankful if it were communicated to all.<a name=248:39></a> I have nothing to add but unfeigned affection in Christ to all.<a name=248:40></a>

		[From the French.<a name=251:1></a>] [J R Rossier] DEAREST BROTHER, -- It appears to me that what is said in Romans 8: 13 is, like a great many of the <i>dicta</i> of St.<a name=251:2></a> Paul, the expression of an abstract principle which belongs even to the nature of things, or rather of God Himself and His principles of government, comprehending certain great truths connected with them, as, for example, here, "through the Spirit.<a name=251:3></a>" Any man whosoever who lives according to the flesh, shall die; this is the end of a life according to the flesh.<a name=251:4></a> He reaps what he has sown: one may listen to the flesh, and that for long enough; and the remorse and anguish and distress, and, in the end, the getting out of this condition, shew that there was a principle which was struggling with the flesh, and to which God, at last, gives the victory.<a name=251:5></a> Still we may be in doubt for a time under what principle such a case ranges itself, but God knows those that are His.<a name=251:6></a> In Romans 2: 6-10 there is a similar abstract principle, of which the apostle makes use in connection with the introduction of the Gentiles.<a name=251:7></a> Also it is not a question of the Spirit in chapter 8; he had already said enough to introduce the power by which this life acted, and the principles or the rule by which it was guided.<a name=251:8></a> In this point of view the passages seem to me very simple, only, as it has happened in so many cases, in the application there are to our undiscerning eyes some very equivocal cases -- but this is a matter of discernment which, besides, does not concern us often, and does not touch the interpretation of the passage .<a name=251:9></a>.<a name=251:10></a>.<a name=251:11></a> .<a name=251:12></a>

		Dearest A Ord, -- As regards Isaiah 66, there cannot be a doubt that the Lord's words refer to Hinnom, where they burnt the filth of Jerusalem; Isaiah 66 refers to the same; Gehenna is the valley of Hinnom.<a name=252:1></a> I take the passage as simply as possible, that the apostate Jews judged at the coming of the Lord will be then a memorial of their folly and the Lord's judgment to those who come up; their carcases also I take simply as such (it is used, it seems, of man or beast), left there an instructive spectacle of divine judgment terrible to behold.<a name=252:2></a> But this is just what shews that it has nothing to do with souls, nor resurrection for judgment.<a name=252:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the use of Gehenna in the New Testament, beyond all controversy, goes beyond this.<a name=252:4></a> In Mark 9: 42-48, it is evident it is no question of the judgment of Jerusalem at the last day.<a name=252:5></a> But Luke 12 puts it out of all question, where the Lord says, "Fear him, which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell;" and, Matthew 10: 28, "Able to destroy both soul and body in hell.<a name=252:6></a>" These passages shew that though the Lord uses the figure of the valley of the son of Hinnom, He uses it figuratively in reference to what is not of this earth; and hence "worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched" must be used in a like way.<a name=252:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The quotation of Isaiah 66 is absolutely futile, and proves nothing at all about the matter, save as a figure; and the figure is, that the judgment should not disappear, as in ordinary cases.<a name=252:8></a> I know they would use the word "destroy," but that is not the question here, but the value of Isaiah 66.<a name=252:9></a> I have discussed it elsewhere; it is false to suppose it means to cause to cease to exist.<a name=252:10></a> I do not remember the three passages in which aijwnivwn is used for the past, but I think there is pro; crovnwn aijwnivwn used in reference to all the dispensed ways of God.<a name=252:11></a> The promise of eternal life was in eternity, before the question of dispensational dealings, for in Christ was life, and we receive of His fulness; but the word crovno" here gives the clearest force (it is 2 Timothy 1: 9) to aijwvnio" as aijw'na tou' kovsmou touvtou .<a name=252:12></a> There is no doubt that aijwvn is used in this way, the end of this aijwvn, etc.<a name=252:13></a>; that is not the question: is it not used in an eternal sense?<a name=252:14></a> Now several passages prove it is; as eternal God, eternal Spirit, eternal covenant, eternal life, along with which is eternal punishment.<a name=252:15></a> As to Romans 2: 6-10, there is no doubt that eternal life is presented as the portion of those who are characterised by the conduct there described, leaving aside, that is, Jew and Gentile, and fixing the portion given of God on realities, realities of moral state, be they found in Jew or Gentile.<a name=252:16></a> I do not see any difficulty here; he shews plainly enough how this can be found in a man, that is, solely through Christ, but it is found in those that are really His.<a name=252:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to Romans 5, it is not exact to say that all sinned in Adam; though, as a general expression, I should apprehend a person.<a name=252:18></a> All fell in him who descend naturally from him, and are under sin, katestavqhsan aJmartwloi;, which it is important to maintain; but in dealing with conscience we have always ejfj w| "for that all have sinned.<a name=252:19></a>" Death does not merely follow as a corruption of nature -- that is a terrible mistake; death came on Adam and all his descendants at once by sin, as a judgment of God -- a very different thing.<a name=252:20></a> Moreover, Satan has the power of death; that is not mere corruption of nature, as the Lord fully felt, who had no corruption of nature.<a name=252:21></a> "Sinned" is ambiguous, because it conveys the idea of personal responsibility in will; all were involved in sin, in Adam's sin.<a name=252:22></a> If you have further difficulty in this, let me know, for it is important to be clear .<a name=252:23></a>.<a name=252:24></a>.<a name=252:25></a> .<a name=252:26></a>

		I have no doubt the Lord is sifting, most rightfully, and I am disposed to think God in grace has stepped in and turned the tide, and that blessing may flow -- I speak of England.<a name=252:27></a> But the sifting was needed; corruption and laziness, Laodiceanism, was creeping in, and fearfully; it was quite polite to be a brother.<a name=252:28></a> Peace be with you.<a name=252:29></a> Kindest love to the brethren around you.<a name=252:30></a> The Lord be with them and all His beloved ones.<a name=252:31></a>

		[T K Rossier] [From the French.<a name=254:1></a>] DEAREST BROTHER, -- I apply myself to the critical questions in order.<a name=254:2></a> I see no proof whatsoever that either Elijah or Moses is one of the two witnesses; I see that the two witnesses are in the same moral position as these two saints, but no proof that they are identical.<a name=254:3></a> Besides, if John the Baptist was not Elijah, he never can be literally.<a name=254:4></a> That the same person should be "angel of his presence," and afterwards be man, is indeed possible; but one who is not a certain individual can never become so literally.<a name=254:5></a> "In the spirit and power of Elias," well and good, but we are speaking of personal identity.<a name=254:6></a>

		I believe that the 144,000 of Revelation 7 are the twelve tribes as a whole; the mystical number of the elect of Israel in its totality; the 144,000 of chapter 14, the special remnant which will have suffered intelligently in the times of trouble at Jerusalem, and which, having been in the same position as Jesus on the earth (according to the thought of grace) will be with Him in the earthly royalty, although they will not be in heaven.<a name=254:7></a> They understand and learn the song, being more associated with heaven than any other.<a name=254:8></a> They form a part necessarily of the whole; this is the reason I said not absolutely.<a name=254:9></a>

		Again, as to Hebrews 10: 12, you are mistaken in supposing that there is transposition, for there is none; on the contrary, I say, that to connect eij" to; dihneke;" with prosenevgka" is neither order nor sense, and that a person who in some measure seized the habits of expression could not connect them.<a name=254:10></a> Mivan .<a name=254:11></a>.<a name=254:12></a>.<a name=254:13></a> prosenevgka" qusivan eij" to;dihneke;" is not, I take it upon myself to say, without pretending to be very learned, which I by no means am, a Greek expression, nor is it even intelligible; whilst eij" to; dihneke;" ejkavqisen as the effect of this sacrifice is perfectly natural, and follows, and connects itself with the train of reasoning; and that no other way of taking the words is admissible.<a name=254:14></a> Besides, eij" to; dihneke;" is not the same thing as eij" to;n aijw'na; it is used in contrast to the business of the Jewish priest, who got up, and remained standing, being a priest, and in order to renew the sacrifice, whilst Christ is seated <i>continuously</i>.<a name=254:15></a> This force of the word becomes so much the more manifest because the use of the word with sacrifices has quite a different sense in this chapter even, and to attach to it the sense that you suppose in connection with the sacrifices would overturn the whole reasoning of the apostle.<a name=254:16></a> In the sense that I attach to it, all is simple (and it is its true sense).<a name=254:17></a> Look at verse 1.<a name=254:18></a> You have there sacrifices offered continuously eij" to; dihneke;".<a name=254:19></a> Give to the word in this passage the sense that you desire to give it in verse 12, and the apostle cuts the ground from under his feet before beginning his reasoning.<a name=254:20></a> The priests offered them <i>continually</i> -- nothing more simple.<a name=254:21></a> Efavpax is the word to express what you desire to attribute to eij" to; dihneke;".<a name=254:22></a> I take eij" to; dihneke;" (verse 14) in the same sense; there is no interruption in their perfection which demands a fresh sacrifice.<a name=254:23></a> (Apply this to the question of forgiveness.<a name=254:24></a>) This implies perpetuity, because if the sacrifice is not renewed, its efficacy is perpetual; but the conclusion that the apostle draws from it is oujk e[ti prosfora; peri; aJmartiva".<a name=254:25></a> There are many of these things about which I have deliberate convictions, and of which I am more or less ready to give an account, but on which I do not insist when I do not see that the profit of souls is involved in it; and about which in any case I do not like to enter into a contest, because this very seldom tends to profit.<a name=254:26></a> Here, for example, I do not admit that the original <i>bears</i> any other translation than that of the English version .<a name=254:27></a>.<a name=254:28></a>.<a name=254:29></a> .<a name=254:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to myself, you should never consider it a reproach to have thought differently from me.<a name=254:31></a> In general, I like better reading what is not according to my own thought, because one always gains (if there is piety, and the foundations are solid) something by reading it.<a name=254:32></a> Divine truth is of such vast extent, and is so many-sided, taking up the nature of God, His dispensations, His ways with men, their responsibility, the positive revelations of His counsels, the moral and eternal relations which flow from what He is, and from what other beings are; that on all points the truth may be looked at in many ways, and one fills up the gap left by the others.<a name=254:33></a> I see this even in the apostles.<a name=254:34></a> John speaks of the nature of God; Paul of His counsels; Peter of His ways.<a name=254:35></a> All have the same truths; only as one goes on everything becomes increasingly absorbed in Christ, and if even there were mistakes in what the man writes, one eliminates them through grace, and one takes what is given of God, which is not according to one's own way of looking at things.<a name=254:36></a> So that it does not trouble me to find in your work ideas different from my own.<a name=254:37></a> Besides, if the foundations are well maintained, I like that there should be great breadth amongst brethren, and not a party formed upon certain views, provided also that devotedness and separation from the world, and the truths that lead us to this, be also maintained in all their energy, because the blessing of souls is in question in this.<a name=254:38></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I think, indeed, dear brother, that, as you say, you have studied too much, and read the Bible too little.<a name=254:39></a> I always find that I have to be on my guard on this point.<a name=254:40></a> It is the teaching of God and not the labour of man that makes us enter into the thoughts and the purpose of God in the Bible.<a name=254:41></a> We search it without doubt, but the cream is not found through much labour of the mind of man.<a name=254:42></a> I do not think that any one will believe that I do not wish that it should be much read, but I do wish that it should be read with God.<a name=254:43></a> It seems to me that there is too much labour in your way of reading it; but in this, as in all else, man learns himself, and purifies himself.<a name=254:44></a> I doubt whether the literal application which you sometimes make is warrantable, and whether the ways and the scope and the purposes of God bend and limit themselves to human accuracy, to what man divines as to accuracy.<a name=254:45></a> I am perfectly sure that all is <i>divinely</i> accurate, but the subject being vast, and seen only in part, to reduce it to human accuracy is, at times, simply to falsify everything.<a name=254:46></a> I see two ends of an immense rainbow, I suppose that they never meet.<a name=254:47></a> Were I able to see the whole, I should only deem that my parallel line has only destroyed the bow; that not only are the beauty and the unity lost, but that which was in the nature even of the refraction which is necessary to the existence of the phenomenon.<a name=254:48></a> The word of God is the communication of divine things to the understanding (rendered capable by the Spirit) of man; but we know in part, and the whole not being communicated as God knows it, as indeed it could not be, and ought not to be, we often lose it by attempting to put it into a frame.<a name=254:49></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		After this long, but as to its principle, important preface, I come to the wise and foolish virgins.<a name=254:50></a> I think that the virgins who accompany the queen (Psalm 45) are probably the cities of Judah; but the use of the same figure to signify the same thing (a thing common enough among students of prophecy) often betrays the one who uses them thus into serious mistakes; and there is still less ground for this when the nature and the moral order of the writing is entirely different.<a name=254:51></a> That the virgins in Matthew 25 should be the cities of Judah, is a thought that never crossed my mind till I saw it in your letter, and it seems to me that the passage would not allow of it for an instant.<a name=254:52></a> I have never had any other thought than that which interprets them as Christians, from the rejection of Christ till the rapture of the church.<a name=254:53></a> Bellett, for a moment, wished to make it the Jewish remnant.<a name=254:54></a> I did not deny the analogies, but he gave it up himself.<a name=254:55></a> I am fully and perfectly assured that it is disciples during the Lord's absence, not the church as a body, but those who take the place of professors in the responsibility that attaches to it.<a name=254:56></a> Up to the end of verse 30 in chapter 24, we see what concerns the Jews and Israel as a body complete and entire: all His elect are gathered from this whole people.<a name=254:57></a> He resumes (chapter 25: 31) to shew the judgment of the Gentiles; between the two the Lord gives the instructions needed for His own during His absence.<a name=254:58></a> This is why the bride is not named.<a name=254:59></a> I admit that chapter 24: 32 to 44 looks at the judgments in relation to the earth, and does not speak of the rapture of the church; but from verse 45 the Lord considers the conduct of His people as to their responsibility during the whole time of His absence.<a name=254:60></a> In the parable of the talents it is so unquestionably; in this 24: 45-51) that of servants.<a name=254:61></a> The thing is clear <i>in principle</i>.<a name=254:62></a> Now, when responsibility is in question for any one, it is always a question of the manifestation of Jesus.<a name=254:63></a> This is what takes place here.<a name=254:64></a> The conduct taken account of is during His absence.<a name=254:65></a> When Jesus appears the effect of this conduct will appear; thus the tovte is but the time of the application of the manifestation of Jesus to the conduct which preceded it.<a name=254:66></a> Now the conduct here is the conduct of professors, I do not at all doubt.<a name=254:67></a> All the elements of the parable confirm for me the application that I make of it.<a name=254:68></a> I do not see in the case of the Jewish remnant or of the cities of Judah, anything resembling the going forth of the virgins to meet the Bridegroom, the sleep during the delay of His coming, the awakening afterwards which causes them to rejoin the Bridegroom before He reaches the bride -- such as takes place in the case of the virgins.<a name=254:69></a> Nothing is more simple than the application of it to professors.<a name=254:70></a> Going out to meet Jesus is the calling of the faithful; alas!<a name=254:71></a> they have fallen asleep.<a name=254:72></a> The cry of the Bridegroom awakes them, because they accompany Him when He comes to Jerusalem.<a name=254:73></a> In the parable they have nothing to do with the bride.<a name=254:74></a> The heavenly bride is never the relation of the members of the church in their responsibility; the bride enjoys without fail her privileges in heaven.<a name=254:75></a> The Bridegroom does not enter, as you make Him do, into His earthly kingdom before the marriage at Jerusalem: it is there that He is king.<a name=254:76></a> There is no question of the Son of man in the parable; the passage where the expression is found (verse 13) is rejected by all the editors.<a name=254:77></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to your remaining explanations, I consider them without foundation, because when Christ will be at Jerusalem, Antichrist will be destroyed.<a name=254:78></a> It seems to me that you seek for details too much, instead of seizing the bearing of the passages.<a name=254:79></a> You say, dear brother, "that it is certain that the word of the Lord tells me that when the Lord shall descend with the church, then the kingdom shall be likened unto the virgins.<a name=254:80></a>" Allow me to tell you that the word of the Lord does not say so at all.<a name=254:81></a> You think, I do not doubt, that you can prove that this is what the passage means, but the word of the Lord does not say it.<a name=254:82></a> I admit that the church is not presented here as the heavenly bride, but the virgins are not presented as friends of the earthly bride, or in any relation with her whatsoever, but <i>exclusively</i> of the Bridegroom, which is the place of the <i>church alone</i>, that is, of its members, for we are not speaking here of angels.<a name=254:83></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the result of your researches, I do not see any harm in your having given it forth, but it is possible that you would have done better if you had kept your work for some time in order to weigh it in the presence of fresh light; but God makes all things work together to the greatest blessing of those who love Him.<a name=254:84></a> It is my habit scarcely to put one foot before the other in the study of the word, and to give forth nothing until I am able, in measure, to say (while still liable to make mistakes, of course), This is <i>the</i> mind of God.<a name=254:85></a> This makes me go on very slowly, but I seldom have to retrace my steps -- a few details that I have adopted from others, without observing it, affecting sometimes, but rarely, the thoughts that I have received.<a name=254:86></a> And now I am about to make a confession to you which may perhaps annoy you; I have not read your work on the Revelation, except a part on the seven churches.<a name=254:87></a> I had more than one reason; amongst others, I do not like reading in fragments anything on which I have to form a judgment; I take the whole.<a name=254:88></a> I am waiting until the whole has come out, and I shall gain this by it, that the controversy will be over, and that I can with greater calmness make my own of what is good, and pass over the rest in silence.<a name=254:89></a> This is what I do when I have time to read works, which is seldom the case.<a name=254:90></a> We need to know how to use the word by the Spirit; without this the letter killeth; it is only a labour of which the mind of man is capable, nothing but a concordance is needed for it .<a name=254:91></a>.<a name=254:92></a>.<a name=254:93></a> .<a name=254:94></a> I own that I think that you rest in the letter in such a way as often to lose the purpose of God .<a name=254:95></a>.<a name=254:96></a>.<a name=254:97></a> .<a name=254:98></a> I do not doubt that I shall find useful things, and others that I can profit by in many ways, although I do not accept the conclusion to which they lead you.<a name=254:99></a> I often find brethren who have received ideas from the Spirit of God, and I profit by these; the conclusion which they draw from them, what they like as the system which they have formed from them, I totally reject; this is by no means an unusual case.<a name=254:100></a> A good many brothers seek edification, and are not able to suck the honey and leave the flower, however beautiful it may be, without further occupying themselves with it; sounding, comparing, judging between rival systems is not their part.<a name=254:101></a> This is the reason I have thought that perhaps it would have been better to devote <i>Le Tmoignage</i> to what would not have required this kind of labour -- but no matter.<a name=254:102></a> In short, when all has appeared, I hope to read it and examine .<a name=254:103></a>.<a name=254:104></a>.<a name=254:105></a> .<a name=254:106></a> A want of agreement about details is not for me a reason for controversy; it must be something essential.<a name=254:107></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to repentance, God proposed it as a matter of government and of His ways with man, as a means of obtaining pardon; and if Israel had repented in this sense they would have been pardoned.<a name=254:108></a> In the end they will have received double for all their sins.<a name=254:109></a> In fact, God forgave His people individually, always in view of the work of Christ.<a name=254:110></a> (Romans 3: 25, 26.<a name=254:111></a>) We must never forget this; otherwise the foundations are shaken, and the meaning of all the sacrifices from Adam on.<a name=254:112></a> <i>If</i> man had received Christ, this would have proved that he was good, and there would have been no need of the sacrifices; but it was far from being so, as the rejection of Christ has proved.<a name=254:113></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the other point, it is impossible that our sins should be imputed to us; "once purged" we "have no more conscience of sins.<a name=254:114></a>" God, as judge, sees the blood which has taken them away, and His unchangeable righteousness has now been manifested.<a name=254:115></a> It is here that we find the force of eij" to; dihneke;" .<a name=254:116></a> Besides, when once sprinkled with the blood of Christ this sprinkling is not repeated, its efficacy lasts for ever; but with the Father I seek forgiveness as from a Father whom I have offended.<a name=254:117></a> I am humbled before Jesus because I have dishonoured Him, but I have no thought that anything can be imputed to me which demands the sprinkling of blood.<a name=254:118></a> The ashes of the red heifer, and the washing of the feet are the figures to apply here; the sprinkling of blood has been made, and it is not repeated.<a name=254:119></a> In the sense of imputation and sprinkling, forgiveness is not now sought; in the sense of having offended one's Father, it is.<a name=254:120></a> The confession of one's faults with humiliation is all right, if grace is fully maintained before the heart.<a name=254:121></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I beg you earnestly, dear brother, to be diligent about your temporal business.<a name=254:122></a> You know well that I am very far from wishing to see you leave your work, but what our hand finds to do we are to do it with our might.<a name=254:123></a> Limit your expenses at once, if they exceed your income, and arrange your business as a good steward of the Lord.<a name=254:124></a> Disorder in one's business is dishonouring to the gospel, as being careful to increase our wealth like the world dries up (one can do no more) the soul.<a name=254:125></a> The word has told us that it is the way and the root of every sort of evil.<a name=254:126></a> But the principles are simple; to live simply in order to be able to give of what one has, and to be faithful in one's own things, making use of them as having been entrusted to us to have in order to use them according to the Lord.<a name=254:127></a> The Book of Proverbs teaches us clearly in detail about these things.<a name=254:128></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a practical difference between oneself and one's sins.<a name=254:129></a> The renewed soul is much more pained at the discovery of the root which shoots up after the knowledge of the love of Jesus, than at the remembrance of past sins, the forgiveness of which it much more easily understands.<a name=254:130></a> Besides, you put the judgment of self before the judgment of sins, whereas sins committed generally act first on the conscience; after that comes the experience of what the flesh is, and this is so true that often in the early days of conversion one thinks that there is no more sin in one.<a name=254:131></a> That of which I have spoken as coming afterwards is not exactly the knowledge of sin in oneself when judging it, but the fact of <i>being in the presence of God</i> -- what we are in the presence of the light.<a name=254:132></a> To judge the flesh, myself, is a different thing from being in the presence of God in judgment, being such.<a name=254:133></a> What you quote from your letter to -- is perfectly right.<a name=254:134></a> When he says that the knowledge of self is the business of the whole life, I think this a very sad idea.<a name=254:135></a> God makes us known to ourselves simply as a means; the object of life is to know Christ.<a name=254:136></a> Fathers in Christ have known Him who is from the beginning; and one does not even know oneself except by knowing Him.<a name=254:137></a> To be occupied only with evil (and there is nothing but evil in oneself) is a sad life, and it is not the thought of God.<a name=254:138></a> His desire is that for our happiness we should be occupied with Him.<a name=254:139></a> It is a thought as false as it is sad, and it means nothing but ignorance of the grace of our God.<a name=254:140></a> The truth is just the opposite of this, that I ought to be occupied only with Christ, and that this is the grace of God to me.<a name=254:141></a> Sometimes, when I have neglected to do this (so much the worse) to bring me back again He is forced to occupy me with myself; but I cannot say that the knowledge of myself is the first element of faith -- the knowledge in general that we are sinners, and even that there is no good in us -- be it so, but we know ourselves badly, very badly, and God causes us to pass through a spiritual eighth of Deuteronomy in order to understand our dependence on Him and His grace, a very difficult lesson for the heart of man to learn.<a name=254:142></a>

		[W K] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I am at last come to England, and with the hope, the Lord willing, of working there a while exceedingly happy in the thought that it is with the Lord's will.<a name=262:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My declaration at Rawstorne Street was, in general purport that, without condemning or justifying any one, not having been here, nor even knowing what had been done, I began on my own definite ground of Christ, and the unity of the church of God; that I felt the need of being on the ground of, and occupied with Christ, and seeking the blessing of His church -- not as undecided, but because the question was for me decided, and that, being on the Lord's ground, as I did not doubt I was, and a service to perform to Him, I could deal with each case individually as it arose, as His servant.<a name=262:2></a> I believe it relieved and set free many who were arrived there in need and desire, and this furnished the positive expression to their minds.<a name=262:3></a> I am very immovable on this ground, the Lord's strength helping me.<a name=262:4></a> I accepted the entire humiliation; and told them that I thought we should only have a blessing in proportion as we did.<a name=262:5></a> I believed I had failed but not in being decided but in being so too little, or rather too late; so that I bowed but that I believed the Lord now permitted me to resume my course -- I believe with more blessing than ever, though different (less agreeable, perhaps, but more real and deeper).<a name=262:6></a> I feel very strongly indeed on the ground I am on, and that it is the Lord's, of and with Him, however poor an instrument I may be when there.<a name=262:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have not entered into the discussions on Craik's doctrines.<a name=262:8></a> I dread dissecting, if I may venture so to speak, Christ, it is not the way to honour Him.<a name=262:9></a> Very few will speak so as not to commit themselves; "No man knoweth the Son but the Father.<a name=262:10></a>" We may know many precious things of Him which enable us to condemn error, but nice definitions of what He was, and how He was it, human language and human thoughts are not competent to, I judge.<a name=262:11></a> I do condemn many things I have heard said, but I have not examined into the details of the teaching objected to, having been out of the country.<a name=262:12></a> Most of the papers I have never read, nor have I an intention, unless for the need of some soul; that is the ground I go upon, each individual soul to whom my service applies, and I wait till the Lord brings things before me.<a name=262:13></a> I have seen and heard what I doubt not is very bad, and fear it is much worse.<a name=262:14></a> I have also looked at Bellett's paper.<a name=262:15></a> I see expressions liable to objection, but I have no doubt of his soundness of soul and doctrine as to Christ.<a name=262:16></a> I apprehend I judge what he says; but it says, I think, nothing; revelations of what Christ is, or of such, I accept -- definitions, scarcely, for what is it that defines?<a name=262:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I had a letter from -- which I answered.<a name=262:18></a> I do not think his conscience is adequately awake to the evil at Bethesda; but I have never thought that souls have been sufficiently individually dealt with.<a name=262:19></a> When one is on unquestioned ground with Christ Himself, one is able then to do so.<a name=262:20></a> That is the ground I take, and with God's help I shall not get off it.<a name=262:21></a> I act broadly as being right; we shall see whether God sanctions and justifies it.<a name=262:22></a> I hope to act in grace, being right.<a name=262:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I know nothing of how anybody has been dealt with anywhere; I am willingly ignorant of abroad: it is undesirable to meddle in the details of what you cannot be answerable for in principle, and are unable to set on any footing in which your conscience can act.<a name=262:24></a> I refer to your question as to Plymouth.<a name=262:25></a> I repeat, I begin and afresh on the broad ground of my service to Christ.<a name=262:26></a> If alone, I act alone; if with others, so much the happier for me.<a name=262:27></a> I apprehend things are opening out in a renewed and somewhat altered character of service in England -- altered as to form and machinery of work, I mean, but this is only beginning, but so it seems to me: what our need is is spiritual energy and love to work.<a name=262:28></a> But God is, I believe, working to produce a new movement in work.<a name=262:29></a> Here they seem to me in a very gracious spirit, humble, and accepting the humiliation as of the Lord, and hence surely for good; and the meetings I have been at have been happy, serious, and godly, free too with a very godly freedom.<a name=262:30></a> I have been very happy at them.<a name=262:31></a> There is less dispersion than I supposed; I should think it had all done them a deal of good: indeed, the gracious Lord makes all things work together for good.<a name=262:32></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I close.<a name=262:33></a> I am working hard, having much study work, but happily; occupied somewhat with books in connection with attacks on scripture; it has at any rate enhanced it to my eyes.<a name=262:34></a> What a difference when you have found the universal mind of God in the word!<a name=262:35></a> In vain people reason -- if kept by grace -- there they are, blowing with their breath at a mountain to upset it; it remains just where it was, and the character of presumption looks like madness if it was not malice, and the total ignorance of what they are, and what the mountain is -- the only thing proved; but the believer gets truth out of it, and the eternal power of the word is more clearly recognised.<a name=262:36></a> Peace be with you, dear brother .<a name=262:37></a>.<a name=262:38></a>.<a name=262:39></a> .<a name=262:40></a>

		[To the same.<a name=264:1></a>] Dearest W K, -- I do not hold that the church is to be ignorant of the times because her period is not determined by them; There are many antichrists, whereby we know that it is the last time.<a name=264:2></a>" Surely if Pharisees ought to have discerned [Matthew 16: 3], we ought.<a name=264:3></a> She ought by the word morally to discern all things, but she is doctrinally by the word set outside these times and signs.<a name=264:4></a> The Revelation is given to the church that she may understand her place; that does not necessarily place her in it.<a name=264:5></a> She is not of time, though in it; not of the world, though in it.<a name=264:6></a> As to the second remark as to the author of the Apocalypse being the same as of the Gospel, etc.<a name=264:7></a>, it is merely ignorance, which would lead me to judge the author incapable of any sound judgment at all about the matter.<a name=264:8></a> The relation of the Father to His children never appears in the Revelation.<a name=264:9></a> It is the throne, and the language and style and spirit so unique as to prove totally the contrary to what you refer to.<a name=264:10></a> -- would have been wiser if he had heard both sides, but in his position he is not likely to be free from the deceit of the enemy .<a name=264:11></a>.<a name=264:12></a>.<a name=264:13></a> .<a name=264:14></a> I do not meddle with other people's judgment as to Bethesda, because I have my own, and as I believe this is a deceit of the enemy; unless delivered from it I do not expect a sound judgment.<a name=264:15></a> The word abiding in us, and the unction of the Holy One can alone deliver us from the world, and Antichrist in his various forms.<a name=264:16></a> The world and its spirit are not discerned else, so that I expect delusion.<a name=264:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have not seen the last edition of Hor Apocalyptic.<a name=264:18></a> I read the third, I think, a year or two ago.<a name=264:19></a> As to four parts of the earth, there seems no ground for it at all.<a name=264:20></a> The Vulgate follows the corrected order of the words adopted by all the editors.<a name=264:21></a> As to the "measure of wheat," others have had the same thought before him; still one man's daily food for his whole wages is at least a scarcity, for as the commentaries say he may have a wife and children, and at any rate must have a house and clothes; however it would prove scarcity, and exact measurement rather than famine: moreover, I pronounce nothing upon it.<a name=264:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to Hebrews 12: 22-24, kaiv divides the terms.<a name=264:23></a> You are come to Mount Zion; to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem; to an innumerable company of angels, the general assembly; to the church of the firstborn whose names are written in heaven; to God the Judge of all; the spirits of just men made perfect; Jesus, Mediator of the new covenant; and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel.<a name=264:24></a> It ascends from the lowest point of millennial glory uniting heaven and earth, the earthly seat of royal grace in contrast with Sinai the nation's responsibility (Zion was after Ichabod), and then gives the heavenly Jerusalem in contrast with earthly Zion as in general the city of heavenly glory.<a name=264:25></a> He then opens out the whole panhvguri" the great multitude of angels just there meeting his eye; then as a special company he singles out the elect heavenly church: this gives the full display of grace in its heavenly character.<a name=264:26></a> Then he rises up to God, but in the character of righteousness which, whatever the life-giving grace needed, was His character in connection with the Jews or Israel, "God, the judge of all;" hence he next sees "the spirits of <i>just</i> men [an Old Testament designation, as Zacharias and Elizabeth in Luke] made perfect," (perhaps from the use of that word for the winning combatants not yet crowned) that is, the saints of the Old Testament; then, to the means of establishing the new covenant with Israel, "Jesus, the Mediator of the new covenant," and the blood which cried for grace for the earth, for sinners and for Israel.<a name=264:27></a> The whole order of things in connection with millennial blessing is introduced, giving withal the present condition of souls, and the efficacy of what was accomplished to bring it in, leaving it, as continually in the Hebrews, open to heavenly or earthly accomplishment, though addressing those concerned in the heavenly.<a name=264:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have no great light and no great difficulty as to the glorious place.<a name=264:29></a> I believe there will be a visible glory which will have in a certain sense a place for man to see it; it is the glorious state of the saints, not the saints simply.<a name=264:30></a> But then we must not leave out what is the very object and value of a symbol moral characterisation.<a name=264:31></a> In Hebrews it is a place, but that place is the church's glory hereafter, which, for instance, Abraham may enjoy, though not it.<a name=264:32></a> In Hebrews it is always an objective thing, for the epistle never rises to it as a condition .<a name=264:33></a>.<a name=264:34></a>.<a name=264:35></a> .<a name=264:36></a>

		[To the same.<a name=266:1></a>] My Dear W K, -- Not having any proper answer further on your mere summary of Mr.<a name=266:2></a> Brock's, I put your letter to be answered as soon as I could, having already replied to the particular arguments you had asked me about.<a name=266:3></a> I am occupied with Newman, so that answering error and grasping systems of it, I had pretty near enough of for the moment, but I have made some progress in it.<a name=266:4></a> I have not the least doubt that Dr.<a name=266:5></a> Lees denies any real sacrificial atonement.<a name=266:6></a> The patristic Platonic form of denying the divinity of Christ is ancient now, and accompanied with the denial of atonement and everlasting punishment.<a name=266:7></a> Thus in Bristol, a man teaches that in Christ God was manifest in the flesh, not <i>He was</i> God, etc.<a name=266:8></a> They hold that the Logos or <i>wisdom</i>, not word of God, dwelt abundantly in Christ, so that what God was was manifested in Him, that He was <i>Lord</i> and is now glorified.<a name=266:9></a> They hold forgiveness by love, not by expiation.<a name=266:10></a> There are various shades, from a subtle Platonism, such as Justin Martyr's, almost allied to orthodoxy, down to Newman's, who went on to the denial that Jesus was the Christ and of all revelation.<a name=266:11></a> He passed through this phase, if phase it can be called, where really all is denied.<a name=266:12></a> The Logos is not held to be a person: God's wisdom in God was manifested in Jesus.<a name=266:13></a> Hence he speaks of God's being the spirit and source of all wisdom and love.<a name=266:14></a> One is manifested in Christ, that is, the lovgo" (reason or wisdom) was, and the love or mercy announced in the mission of the Messiah, and <i>therefore</i> in the forgiveness of sins.<a name=266:15></a> This excludes evidently expiation, and denies that Jesus was God in any personal sense.<a name=266:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to begotten, not made, it is ambiguous: he may believe Christ to be Son as born into this world, or he may hold the Platonic notion, modified by Christian doctrines as Justin Martyr (if my memory does not deceive me, though elsewhere orthodox), that is, that the lovgo" was eternal in God as His wisdom or mind, but was begotten and produced into a distinct existence before and for the creation.<a name=266:17></a> His creed does not say which, and I cannot determine; but the real existence of the lovgo", as a very Person, uJpovstasi", who could be with God from all eternity, I am confident he does not hold.<a name=266:18></a> He believes in one God the Father and one Lord Jesus, using this to exclude Jesus from being Himself God (though man also), and making Him only the wisdom of God manifested in this man, begotten perhaps in a remarkable manner by the Holy Ghost.<a name=266:19></a> As to the Holy Ghost, I cannot tell what he holds.<a name=266:20></a> I <i>suppose</i> some vague idea of an emanation.<a name=266:21></a> Newman calls it, though an avowed infidel, God in the heart.<a name=266:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a speculative Platonic system, using Christianity to enlarge its system and incorporate its ideas; but there is no faith at all in the Person of the Lord Jesus Christ, none really whatever, nor in expiation.<a name=266:23></a> This kind of thing is emerging now a good deal .<a name=266:24></a>.<a name=266:25></a>.<a name=266:26></a> .<a name=266:27></a>

		MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I doubt the John the Baptist half week, the cycle system is interesting, at least that part which relates to the time of judgment not counting, but it seems to me the reasoning is entirely in a circle.<a name=267:1></a> This does not make me reject it, because if the moral proofs are adequate they are the strongest for a child of God; on that I am not prepared to pronounce.<a name=267:2></a> But it is externally proved by what it has to prove.<a name=267:3></a> I am printing, or ought to be, on Daniel (I left it in France) a critique on Gaussen -- short, but destroying in toto all his alleged foundation.<a name=267:4></a> I do not feel a very great inclination to nourish myself with all the errors propagated on the subject of prophecy, nor to occupy general readers with them.<a name=267:5></a> To say that 1 Corinthians 15: 28 explained in the ordinary way makes the first coming an exaltation of Christ and the second a humiliation, is nonsense.<a name=267:6></a> God humbled Himself in becoming man, but man was exalted to reign.<a name=267:7></a> The passages quoted as to paradidw' ("delivers up") prove nothing at all; they all relate to teaching.<a name=267:8></a> Who in English would reason that b cause I delivered a lecture, it was evident that when I deliver a prisoner I keep him still!<a name=267:9></a> If a kingdom be delivered up by man to God, that God may be all in all, it is that the human holding of it should cease -- its mediatorial character paradivdwmi signifies giving up to another.<a name=267:10></a> I admit the emphasis on the word God, because man has held the kingdom, but it is precisely what shews the force of the passage.<a name=267:11></a> He must reign <i>till</i> -- and then He will give up the kingdom.<a name=267:12></a> Nothing can be more simple.<a name=267:13></a> It is not Christ who makes all things new, but God.<a name=267:14></a> Christ reigns, subdues all things, work that God the Father has entrusted to Him, all in this creation.<a name=267:15></a> Then comes all things new of the new creation, where justice does not reign but dwell.<a name=267:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Citing 2 Samuel 7: 13 is confounding His reign as Son of David with the universal glory spoken of in the New Testament which is a totally different thing.<a name=267:17></a> Daniel 2: 44 is the worldly kingdom also; 7: 14 also -- peoples, nations, tongues, languages.<a name=267:18></a> Luke 1: 33 is the kingdom over Jacob, the throne of David.<a name=267:19></a> 2 Timothy 4: 1 proves nothing at all save that His appearing is the time of His kingdom.<a name=267:20></a> 2 Peter 3 proves the instability of created things against those who based their hopes on their stability, and laughed at the coming of the Lord.<a name=267:21></a> None of these passages, nor any in the Old Testament, touch the universal headship of Christ spoken of in the New Testament, the eighth Psalm alone giving in its general language the connecting link.<a name=267:22></a> In another sense, Christ does reign for ever and ever, and so do the saints; but it is not the human kingdom in contrast with God's being all in all.<a name=267:23></a> "We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty," is the language of Revelation 11 -- the worldly kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, that is, it is the power of God as contrasted with man, begun in His taking in hand judgment and rule in the world; and that power could never cease.<a name=267:24></a> The kingdom thus viewed is God's in contrast with man's evil, and that is for ever.<a name=267:25></a> In 1 Corinthians 15, which is as clear as possible, it is Christ as man having held it for purposes of subjection, who gives up this special kingdom which puts down other authority, to God that the power may be God's exclusively.<a name=267:26></a> As partaking of the divine glory we reign for ever and ever (Revelation 22), but it is not in war or in judgment given to man.<a name=267:27></a>

		My mind had gone on to fresh inquiry on the sufferings of Christ in applying the sufferings of Gethsemane more exclusively to the effort of Satan as the power of darkness, though using the cup Jesus had to drink, in the view of oppressing Him; and that this was closed before He left it, and thus Satan's power of death properly closed.<a name=267:29></a> On the cross it was the wrath of God, and out of that also Jesus emerged before giving up His Spirit to His Father.<a name=267:30></a> This, connected with what death is, and what life was, had occupied and interested me a good deal.<a name=267:31></a> All that relates to Him is blessed.<a name=267:32></a>

		Dearest A Ord, -- I have very happy news in general from the south of France, but nothing since the Revolution save that they were quiet.<a name=271:1></a> I should feel cordially disposed to join in any humiliation with brethren, and feel it very desirable.<a name=271:2></a> I think Wigram dreaded a little the appearance of a distinct formal body.<a name=271:3></a> If this meant not owning <i>all</i> saints as one, I should indeed object to it as ruinous and sectarian; but that brethren so called, as such, should publicly (as far as that is used in a christian sense) take the place of humiliation, I should feel most desirable; I wait only the Lord's time for its accomplishment.<a name=271:4></a> I quite take this ground myself before God, and before all those who walk wrong, other Christians and all.<a name=271:5></a> I trust God is working, in His grace, very fruitfully in the hearts of His saints: may He keep us humble, and near Him, so that we may not yet more need humiliation.<a name=271:6></a>

		I apprehend as to the passages, that Hebrews 6, they were called to learn, that is, go on from what had been learnt in a puerile way of truth and Christ, and go on to what the Holy Ghost had brought out of the powers of the world to come If they had left this latter, it was no good to go back to lay the old foundation again: if they had it, they ought to go on to something else, so that it was no good his speaking of the old part.<a name=271:7></a> All short of the Holy Ghost's revelation of a glorious Christ would connect itself with the beginning of Christ, I apprehend.<a name=271:8></a> Paul was bringing <i>Hebrews</i> out, just before the destruction of Jerusalem, of what linked them with what was ready to vanish away -- outside the camp -- into that which he had founded as the church in connection with Christ glorified: only this, for this reason, somewhat transitional, the church is not itself developed, only the power of the new thing.<a name=271:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Covenant is an obligation to another which does not enter into the idea of being my own body, or my own child; but then those who form this body, or are these children, are subjects of what in substance was a covenant, though I do not know that it is called so, for the word covenant is rather what God has condescended to assure man's heart by; but when Christ says, "Lo, I come to do thy will," He undertakes something and the Father having given Him power over all flesh to give eternal life to those whom He has given to Him, He accomplishes all, so as to present them according to the thoughts of the Father's love perfect to Him.<a name=271:10></a> All this ordering of wondrous divine counsels, Christ having undertaken all needed, and obtained by redemption, and given, as the Father has sent, the Holy Ghost to accomplish the rest in us, being, so to speak, undertaken by parties, if one may reverently so speak, has been called a covenant; and I apprehend the apostle speaks so alludingly when he says, "through the blood of the everlasting covenant.<a name=271:11></a>" But in general, save as an allusion, covenant is an inferior idea to this taking up their own place in this glorious counsel of God by the Persons in the Trinity.<a name=271:12></a> I doubt that scripture would speak of their covenanting among themselves, as if they had had to bind or assure one another.<a name=271:13></a> It is called for us an everlasting covenant, but this, though it embraces all this really, is rather the idea of God assuring man by its being an immutable, unchanging thing, secured to man by Christ's blood: not the Persons binding themselves among themselves.<a name=271:14></a> However, this is a matter of words, and those who use the expression; though they lower the notions of divine things.<a name=271:15></a> It is well to be true to these, because one is here to God's glory, and no stumbling-block is put in the way of others; but those who use these ways of speaking are so in purpose of heart, and substantively; so that one may be at ease with them.<a name=271:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I should not answer very dogmatically as to Genesis 4: 7.<a name=271:17></a> Those who take the sense of sin-offering argue on that on account of which you argue against it, the word being applied to the lying down of an animal, the victim is there before you at your door.<a name=271:18></a> "If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted?<a name=271:19></a> -- and unto thee shall be his (Abel's) desire, and thou shalt rule over him.<a name=271:20></a>" Then there is the parenthesis, "If thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door.<a name=271:21></a>" Now I do not doubt that this speaks of the culpability of Cain; the only question is, if it does not present this culpability, as God has presented it to us, that is in Christ as the sin-offering.<a name=271:22></a> Other translations take the whole thing in another sense; I apprehend that the primary sense is, sin is there before you; you meet it in going forth; it lies at your door.<a name=271:23></a> He could not escape finding it attached to him: only God has laid it before us in the sin-offering in Christ.<a name=271:24></a> I do not doubt the English is right, and in general the other translations wrong.<a name=271:25></a> I believe these were all the passages you asked me about, so I close, dear --

		DEAR BROTHER, -- I was very happy to receive your letter and those of our brethren.<a name=280:3></a> The account B -- gives us of your position at -- and in its neighbourhood has greatly interested the brethren at our conference.<a name=280:4></a> They were just discussing the question of how it could be managed to have more frequent intercommunion between the labouring brethren, and also to knit more closely the links of brotherhood among the labourers, whilst leaving each one to full individual liberty and to the guidance of the Spirit of God in his work.<a name=280:5></a> At the beginning this was less difficult.<a name=280:6></a> The field was smaller, and they saw one another oftener, the whole of the work was more easily surveyed, and all was done more in fellowship.<a name=280:7></a> Now that the field has greatly widened and increased on more sides than one, sometimes a labourer and a flock find themselves rather isolated, seeing nobody else for a year or two.<a name=280:8></a> The brethren who travel in the work are, up to a certain point, a medium of fellowship; yet there is room for improvement in this respect.<a name=280:9></a> Your letters came just in time to make us feel how much these communications interested hearts in the labours and services of a brother.<a name=280:10></a> In the main this was what took place everywhere more or less, and it was felt one self-same work of the Holy Spirit which unites us in the ways of the love of our God.<a name=280:11></a> I hope to see you at the end of the summer .<a name=280:12></a>.<a name=280:13></a>.<a name=280:14></a> .<a name=280:15></a>

		Dearest W Kelly, -- I trust you will have found blessing at the meeting; I have no doubt the Lord's hand was most abundantly in it.<a name=280:18></a> Of course it can be only so far as our hearts really humble themselves, each one for his own evil, before God, that we shall find real and permanent blessing.<a name=280:19></a> At the meeting at Bristol, I declared that I had withdrawn my original circular as to Bethesda.<a name=280:20></a> This took a stumbling-block out of the way of others, and left the ground entirely on its own merits, putting me entirely out of the question.<a name=280:21></a> I was questioned on it and cross-questioned: I only resumed all my liberty, that is, position of duty to Christ for my future path; so that Bethesda stands on its own merits, and the discussion on it and its relationship with brethren I am totally free from, as that is the only act I ever had to say to.<a name=280:22></a> This I felt its effect, I withdrew it as taking away a difficulty from others, only taking care I should be bound to nothing as to my course by it.<a name=280:23></a> It was asked; I have acceded.<a name=280:24></a> I did not see any great sense (feeling, I did) in asking the withdrawal of it; but if it met that feeling I was content, provided I was free to do what was right unconditionally in whatever I have to do, that is, that it was understood I preserved this liberty intact.<a name=280:25></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now as to the millennium, Mr.<a name=280:26></a> Browne's reasonings are null, because at the beginning, the Fathers did expect the Lord as a present thing; during the 1260 years they thought very little about it, and at the end it did not hinder the present expectation.<a name=280:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards the word "hour" (John 5: 25, 28), I know of no one who has spoken of an unbroken resurrection hour.<a name=280:28></a> Wra has nothing to do with the continuity of other facts which may occur in it, but of the unity of the epoch, so as to make one time or season of it.<a name=280:29></a> Thus it is used for a year because it is one epoch; yet spring, summer, and winter, seed-time and harvest, very opposite and not continuous facts, are found within it.<a name=280:30></a> The hour is not the hour of resurrection, but resurrection takes place in it.<a name=280:31></a> This indeed is evident upon the face of the passage.<a name=280:32></a> If the hour derive its character from the resurrection, the whole argument is certainly unfounded; for there are two resurrections distinct in character, and no continuity derived from them.<a name=280:33></a> If it does not derive its character from the resurrection, then the fact of having two resurrections in it, a thousand years apart, does not destroy its continuity.<a name=280:34></a> Two periods were in the first "hour" (verse 25) characterised by Christ's presence and Christ's absence: the wra derives its unity, not its continuity, from something else.<a name=280:35></a> There was an epoch when souls should rise at the voice of the Son, another (verse 28) when bodies should.<a name=280:36></a> What gave unity to that epoch is another question; of the answer to it I have little doubt -- the presence of the Lord in glory, and the kingdom in that power in which He rose from the dead.<a name=280:37></a> They were not to marvel if He quickened souls, for, at another epoch, He would be in such manifestation of power that He would raise the dead.<a name=280:38></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I know nothing of a voice in 1 Corinthians 15: 51.<a name=280:39></a> There is a trump (but the wicked have clearly no part in the statements here); there is the <i>archangel's</i> voice in 1 Thessalonians 4: 16: so that I do not exactly know what is meant about a voice, twice citing <i>these</i> passages.<a name=280:40></a> But a <i>common</i> resurrection is totally unscriptural, and the argument goes much further than the millennium.<a name=280:41></a> <i>All</i> scripture shews a distinct act of resurrection, if there be only a minute between; them that are Christ's are not <i>confounded</i> with the others, whatever the interval.<a name=280:42></a> There is nothing whatever said of a trumpet sound with the wicked; they are carefully excluded in the two passages where the trumpet is spoken of.<a name=280:43></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The argument as to 2 Peter 3 has, with equal confidence, been used for burning the earth at the beginning of the millennium.<a name=280:44></a> But I do not admit the day of the Lord to be a day, but a period; in that period, were it a million years, the heavens will pass away.<a name=280:45></a> In the passage itself twice the apostle declares to us its importance with God.<a name=280:46></a> I do not see anything very new or very wise in this settlement of the matter -- very reasonable to put it out as his way of thinking; but the mass of testimony, of direct instruction which it controverts, makes the nice casuistry it is founded upon of no comparative weight.<a name=280:47></a> But it is all very well it should be discussed.<a name=280:48></a>

		[W Kelly] DEAR BROTHER, -- I forgot to notice 1 Thessalonians 4 Sir E.<a name=282:1></a> Denny raised the question on some statement of Trotter's, and was even anxious about it, which I was not.<a name=282:2></a> All were agreed as to doctrine.<a name=282:3></a> I have long hesitated over the passage, having thought of bringing the souls back, bringing them up from the dead, and their coming with Christ with the rest when He appears You will remark that it is <i>God</i> brings with Him, not Christ, this had rather long ago made me hesitate if it was not God raising them as Christ (the sun would be as suzhvsomen): they will be brought from the dead as much as, and as Jesus.<a name=282:4></a> However, on the whole, I am disposed to think it is "bring with Him" when He comes and appears, the result of their resurrection.<a name=282:5></a> They will not be absent, or lose their place in the glorious appearing, no more than Jesus did by dying; they will rise first even.<a name=282:6></a> <i>God's</i> bringing them with Him is not out of the order of the apostle's thought; "which in his times he shall shew who is the blessed and only Potentate;" God shews the appearing of Jesus; so He brings the others and shews them with Him.<a name=282:7></a> But I am not prepared to dogmatise on it, nor to say as teaching, that is God's mind in the passage, at which Sir E.<a name=282:8></a> is astonished.<a name=282:9></a>

		It is needful for us that we should pass through the sorrows as well as the joys of the work of the Lord, happy if our sorrows are His and His joys ours.<a name=283:3></a> The nearer we are to Him, and the more we thus reproduce the faithful image of what He is, the more we shall encounter the opposition of the world when it awakes; and still more shall we experience the want of sympathy from Christians who will not walk in His footsteps; and they will even oppose us, forming as they do for themselves a system on principles that are less according to God.<a name=283:4></a> What trouble St.<a name=283:5></a> Paul had because he insisted on maintaining the gospel at the height of the grace which had been revealed to him!<a name=283:6></a> We shall not escape it.<a name=283:7></a> But if we suffer with Jesus, we shall reign with Him.<a name=283:8></a> In short, your account has given me joy.<a name=283:9></a> For the testimony, it needs decided, morally decided persons, persons who for the love of Christ have broken with the world.<a name=283:10></a> One such is worth more than a thousand laggards; I am speaking of the testimony.<a name=283:11></a>

		Dearest A Ord, -- It would have been a joy to me to have assisted at your meeting at Torquay; I am most glad the brethren meet together, and thus place themselves before God.<a name=284:1></a> God alone knows what He can do in breaking down barriers, and uniting in testimony those separated.<a name=284:2></a> But I fear, humanly speaking the world has too strong a hold on those with whom I cannot walk, to hope, humanly speaking, much.<a name=284:3></a> It is not as a reproach to them I say this, for there ought to have been spirituality to prevent it, and grace to overcome it; so that before God I take every share of blame and humiliation; but I fear, sadly fear, it is the part which, in a measure, accepts the worldliness, which is broken off, save some dear souls, who are just the grief of heart to me and others, who may have innocently entered.<a name=284:4></a> I should always more earnestly urge taking up each individual case; but I apprehend the path of those who walk by faith is to pursue in peace their course, seeking all that God can give them of souls for Him in earnestness of zeal in these latter days.<a name=284:5></a>

		The only remark I have to make as to the meeting is that I judge the study of scripture would be a most useful part of it; to take a book or chapters, as God.<a name=284:6></a> may direct you, and study it detailedly and diligently onward; this kind of meeting, or employment of time in great part at the meeting, I am persuaded would be of the greatest use, and place the hearts of brethren most usefully before the word.<a name=284:7></a> We have at this moment a meeting of this kind at Lausanne .<a name=284:8></a>.<a name=284:9></a>.<a name=284:10></a> .<a name=284:11></a>

		The connection of hJma" and aujtou" is not so difficult (Revelation 5: 9, 10) because the elders were offering up the incense of the prayers of others in their vials and the aujtou" is extraordinarily far from hJgovrasa"; though Revelation Greek is unusual.<a name=285:8></a>

		As regards Maurice, it is a mind dissatisfied with the stupidity and narrowness of dead orthodoxy and having no spiritual reins from God by the word and Spirit, that has run loose to make a God such as he would have -- and the common course of middle-age heresies.<a name=285:9></a> Often real witnesses and sufferers for God and the truth, but not guarding themselves from the seductions of mental heresies -- sometimes, no doubt, this last a one; and the persecuting church, which kept nominal truth (a thing the Fathers never did), was very glad to lump them all up together, charge them all with the worst things, and burn them, doing the devil's work with both hands earnestly in another way.<a name=285:10></a> They seldom escaped the superstition and paganism of the hierarchical iniquity and corruption, without the mind getting loose, and meddling with and spoiling the things of God.<a name=285:11></a> It is this that shews what a total ruin the church of God was and is.<a name=285:12></a> I have found a solemn and most affecting consideration -- what love God must have had to His elect to carry them through it all, and bear with them, as He does indeed with as cold and lifeless ones in, perhaps, things more hateful to Him than these helpless wanderings of mind.<a name=285:13></a> Such is M.<a name=285:14></a>'s case, in a measure, but he has the misfortune to be the original mover in the mental wandering.<a name=285:15></a> Will is in it, and hence, I fear, unless God steps in, that it is one of the many ways in which the devil is let loose in these days to unsettle everything.<a name=285:16></a> Men cannot be satisfied with death; God Himself is rousing them; and Satan would seek to bring in an activity not subject to, and outside God's word, the only guide in such cases, not merely into truth, but hindering the will from being active, which, acting by the mind, just makes heresy, and (whatever the thoughts) cannot profit, because it makes God subject to it.<a name=285:17></a> I do not see much grace in M.<a name=285:18></a>; he will have, not truth, but liberty to put God out his own way.<a name=285:19></a> He is not willing to suffer, nor suffer for the truth; he likes the Establishment; it is a comfortable place -- so it is, no doubt -- and he would seek to maintain a liberty in it which would leave free his will without its costing him anything.<a name=285:20></a> God may lead him into subjection, but I do not see it yet.<a name=285:21></a> In the present universal unsettling it is possible God may allow this one in addition, and not allow the dead barrier of orthodoxy and authority to settle and quiet the matter; sometimes for souls for His elect's sake, He does.<a name=285:22></a> If I can, I will look into it.<a name=285:23></a>

		[To the same.<a name=288:13></a>] Dearest W Kelly, -- As regards Mr.<a name=288:14></a> Aitkin's letter, I think it the most arrant stuff I ever came across, but falling in with the current of the principles by which Satan is generally working now -- very proper and likely to deceive rich or poor, putting conscience to sleep, and settling in the apostate form of self-righteousness; namely, the "voluntary humility" connection with ordinances.<a name=288:15></a> I have no doubt from some parts of it there is a direct power of Satan in it, the points of conformity to Irvingism and Popery leave no doubt at all on my mind.<a name=288:16></a> I stated long ago my fears to -- .<a name=288:17></a> This paper leaves me no doubt upon it.<a name=288:18></a><a href="#288:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> It does not follow that no Christians may not get into it, to their almost [certain] ruin but for Christ; as there did into Irvingism, and I dare say, and indeed know, there are into Puseyism.<a name=288:19></a> But it is entirely to be treated as Satan's work, whatever Christians may get into or work in it, as there are in popery itself.<a name=288:20></a> But it is to be treated as directly Satan, and it will have no force.<a name=288:21></a> I have been looking over Archdeacon Wilberforce's book, and noticing the main point of it.<a name=288:22></a> The letter falls in with a mass of previously prepared habits of error in the mass of minds, and some fresh truth which gives a gloss of new knowledge calculated to take among the ignorant, to whom it is wondrous, so as to have an attractive and subtle character in this respect; but I denounce it as directly and positively Satan <i>in se</i>.<a name=288:23></a> I keep the letter to have a copy, but, as I do not know to whom it is addressed, shall not use it beyond myself without knowing to whom, and with their permission.<a name=288:24></a> I keep it for my own reference, which, as shewn to me, I feel free to do, not to mis-state or mis-conceive anything in it.<a name=288:25></a>

		MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I know the love of the brethren will be glad to hear of me, and that they will rejoice to hear something of the work .<a name=290:1></a>.<a name=290:2></a>.<a name=290:3></a> .<a name=290:4></a> The Lord has been most gracious to me; even the weather has favoured my work.<a name=290:5></a> I was at Haarlem and Amsterdam, besides breaking bread at Ostend with a Dutch family.<a name=290:6></a> The Lord so ordered it that a brother I well knew who was the means of their conversion, was on a visit to them, and I thus came to know them.<a name=290:7></a> The wife and her sister true and decided, the husband, a personal friend of the king, much less so, though very decidedly converted.<a name=290:8></a> Thence I went through Rotterdam to Haarlem, where I was able to hold a good deal of intercourse with those who speak French.<a name=290:9></a> I knew a brother there also, with his wife, having stood alone for the Lord's sake.<a name=290:10></a> I felt the Lord with me.<a name=290:11></a> We broke bread there again on Sunday; there also I made acquaintance with another Dutch family, converted and safe as to their path through the means of brethren at J.<a name=290:12></a> I held a meeting in the room of a brother with whom some meet, rather in a disputing way, but amongst whom several are getting clear, and again in a fuller room where many came.<a name=290:13></a> I made also a good many visits and felt the Lord very much with me.<a name=290:14></a> The brethren I first mentioned accompanied me and stayed some days to make more.<a name=290:15></a> The door seems decidedly open in Holland, chiefly among the upper classes on account of the language .<a name=290:16></a>.<a name=290:17></a>.<a name=290:18></a> .<a name=290:19></a> I can already use the Bible pretty readily in Dutch, but that is not speaking.<a name=290:20></a> I then left for Germany.<a name=290:21></a> The first ten days the labouring brethren met together to study Scripture.<a name=290:22></a> We read John's Gospel, 1 John, Galatians, Matthew and a part of Luke, with very much of the Lord's presence, and I trust profit to all.<a name=290:23></a> Matthew and Luke were only a synopsis, but I never had Matthew so clear.<a name=290:24></a> On the Monday after I set off to the hills to visit one of the working districts, the first time.<a name=290:25></a> They were not in a happy state.<a name=290:26></a> They do not break bread there yet.<a name=290:27></a> The clergy are rationalists, but there is little life and union in those who meet to seek better edification; however, we had a meeting and I said some things in German.<a name=290:28></a> Then to a very dear brother's, chief smith in a manufactory, where I held a meeting and slept.<a name=290:29></a> Before the meeting I dictated an article on Romans 4-8, for the brethren's publication -- also a compendium.<a name=290:30></a> Thence, three hours' walk to a village in the hills where we finished the paper and translated some of Romans, and had a meeting in the evening.<a name=290:31></a> The next day to a very wild village in the hills three hours further across the waste, mostly new, where we had a meeting and conversed on Scripture.<a name=290:32></a> The next day six hours' walk further up the hills to a brother engaged in the work, who has been greatly blessed there.<a name=290:33></a> I stayed there Friday evening, Saturday and the Lord's day, and it was pretty much a meeting, save Saturday evening, all the time.<a name=290:34></a> We read most of Ephesians through.<a name=290:35></a> They came from five hours round and more, so that we were many on Sunday and had a very happy day -- not merely the joy that accompanies such a meeting with a little excitement, but I really believe the Lord's presence and blessing; we broke bread in the afternoon.<a name=290:36></a> Many could not get there.<a name=290:37></a> In the evening, I spoke on the Lord's coming.<a name=290:38></a> I cannot expatiate in German, but I can set forth the truth, and they understand me very well now.<a name=290:39></a> At 12 at night I got with a lantern through the wood and took the coach back.<a name=290:40></a> You may suppose it was not Hornsey Place or Tollington Park.<a name=290:41></a> In these villages no question of meat in four out of six places, but rye bread and vegetables and a slice of bacon.<a name=290:42></a> One night I slept on chairs, another on straw.<a name=290:43></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I made through mercy six hours' walk the next day, and held the meeting without being tired; but the beloved people give me their best with all their heart.<a name=290:44></a> In the last two places they were very hearty in the Lord.<a name=290:45></a> We had a sort of meeting on the way from the last named place but one.<a name=290:46></a> The evening before they thought it wiser not, so we held it where I mentioned on account of the police, and we visited them on the way.<a name=290:47></a> I thought to have gone further, but we deferred in the hope of getting through a version of the New Testament which is grievously wanted here -- a serious undertaking -- but I have been long exercised in it in English and French, so that it is easier for me of course.<a name=290:48></a> I have a native German for the actual form of the phrases, and I have a Dutch (which is the best I know), English (which rivals it), and pure German translations to refer to, with my two critical Greek Testaments.<a name=290:49></a> We have done Romans and now there is a moment's hindrance, but I trust the Lord to remove it, and I feel assured that I shall get through this work also.<a name=290:50></a> My journey up the hills was very happy and, thank God, on Scriptural subjects I can make myself very well understood in German.<a name=290:51></a> I have been of course at the meetings, but I only knew the principal brothers much, for usually they are occupied much at their manufactures, and at the study with the workmen; and having only an imperfect knowledge of the language, it is helpful to myself, I find, to get out into the villages and be with the saints, where from their position it is as a stream in a thirsty land.<a name=290:52></a> The blessing is very real and continues; trials and proofs of the flesh accompany it.<a name=290:53></a> You will suppose I would draw no false pictures.<a name=290:54></a> In many towns I have spoken of there is trial from coldness and failure; nevertheless there have been a good many conversions, and the working of God's Spirit is large and undoubted, and most of those I saw are rejoicing in the conscious acceptance of it.<a name=290:55></a> Many of these poor peasants are as advanced in substantial knowledge as the brethren in London are, and in many the life of the Spirit is very sensible.<a name=290:56></a> The Lord bless you, beloved brother, and all the beloved brethren in London.<a name=290:57></a> My heart desires their blessing and their growing up into Christ in everything.<a name=290:58></a> Peace be with you all.<a name=290:59></a>

		I have been myself mixed up with the work on the Continent only since the end of 1837, and since then the Lord has certainly granted a large and rich blessing, at least in proportion to our poor faith and efforts, and has raised up many dear labourers in His vineyard, though their number be, as the Lord has warned us, still so small.<a name=292:5></a> But His ways are perfect.<a name=292:6></a> It began in Switzerland.<a name=292:7></a> I preached and taught what I knew.<a name=292:8></a> And the full and holy liberty of the gospel, the assurance of salvation in contrast with the law, the standing and privileges of the church, and the coming of the Lord Jesus to receive her to Himself, together with the dwelling of the Holy Ghost in the church and in each member here below, were spread abroad and received by many.<a name=292:9></a> Gradually assemblies were formed by the truth; subsequently some young men who desired to work for the Lord wished to read the scriptures with me.<a name=292:10></a> I feared a little giving up my own work but would not refuse them, and for a year at one time and a good part of one at a subsequent period, I had ten or twelve, not always the same, with me, and we studied the word together.<a name=292:11></a> Most of them are now engaged in the work.<a name=292:12></a> They gradually got into work as the Lord called them.<a name=292:13></a> Others, already long labourers in the field got clearer light and worked with it so that many conversions took place, and gatherings were formed by the working of God's Spirit.<a name=292:14></a> This took place chiefly in three cantons, Geneva, Vaud and Neuchtel the whole extent of the three not being very great.<a name=292:15></a> Still many hundreds were gathered and through grace persevere.<a name=292:16></a> Perhaps small and great there are fifty gatherings in all, of which the largest may be about 200, another 170 or 180, one or two of 100, and so on to very small ones.<a name=292:17></a> The most of the work took place in the course of a few years, but then in some districts there was a decline of energy, in some places very sensibly; and there were no circulating active labourers, though the gatherings persevered.<a name=292:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord had much blessed the word in the mountain valleys; there had been about 70 or 80 converted in three or four months.<a name=292:19></a> Latterly, thank God, the Lord has revived His work, and for three or four years back there has been pretty constant progress and conversions in Neuchtel and latterly a very considerable blessing to the canton of Vaud, partly on new ground, partly on the old.<a name=292:20></a> In general the accounts are happy.<a name=292:21></a> The Lord sent them back one or more active servants of His grace and labourers in His field.<a name=292:22></a> Some of them, young men, went to France, some of them having come indeed thence, and one or two others who had received the truth clearly and given up everything to serve the Lord.<a name=292:23></a> A brother whom God raised up in France and who devoted himself to the work, but preached the law, had through his devotedness opened the way in a very wide country though he was not clear.<a name=292:24></a> God had used him independently of the work in Switzerland.<a name=292:25></a> He fell sick and one of our brethren went to help, three of them who had broken bread with me being of that country.<a name=292:26></a> In some four years 300 or 400 received the truth there.<a name=292:27></a> God raised up some labourers also, one of whom has worked in Switzerland.<a name=292:28></a> Also one of our Swiss brethren went further on into the mountains; there are I suppose, in all there, some 700 at least or more who were converted.<a name=292:29></a> The blessing was remarkable these four or five springs in succession.<a name=292:30></a> They had leisure then.<a name=292:31></a> There was no preaching without a conversion.<a name=292:32></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Last year there was a good deal of blessing in a part of the field.<a name=292:33></a> The work under God's hand went further south, where another French brother also who had received the truth went down to work.<a name=292:34></a> In general all was dark and opposed with the exception of three towns and one village.<a name=292:35></a> I joined in the work at this time.<a name=292:36></a> There many meetings have been formed, some of them numerous.<a name=292:37></a> Last year in one station which had seemed motionless, first some sixty in a short space and then, after a smart persecution and fines and imprisonments, some forty more were converted, and in the east the Lord worked simultaneously, and some 300 came together in three or four villages.<a name=292:38></a> One of these has been dreadfully decimated by the cholera last year, but the brethren continue and even with more seriousness since Quite at the other side of France (Casta Tarbes and Orthez) a Christian but lately deceased, who had laboured there before, returned and worked there.<a name=292:39></a> It is directly at the foot of the Pyrnes close to Spain.<a name=292:40></a> There also there were conversions and some 200 meet in five meetings; lately the Lord has been working sensibly afresh there, more truth; thence also in Lot et Garonne, the Lord has gathered a good many, and also on the Tey.<a name=292:41></a> Lately He has been at work also along the Rhone in the Departments (counties) of Upper and Lower Rhone.<a name=292:42></a> This is a work only beginning, where a French brother once a clergyman has been and is active.<a name=292:43></a> The first work I spoke of in France was west of the Rhone.<a name=292:44></a> It then extended east of the Rhone, and there a good many meetings were gathered and many conversions, in one part almost entirely Roman Catholics.<a name=292:45></a> There the brethren have been fined and imprisoned, but it did not hinder the work.<a name=292:46></a> In Marseilles and near to the foot of the Alps in the Isre, the Lord also has blessed the word and gathered souls; so in the Department Hrault and Auvergne, the Lozre, though the gatherings are not so numerous in these, but in some lately the Lord has been working sensibly.<a name=292:47></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Lately, these two last years, the Lord has been working in Germany.<a name=292:48></a> Some years back the truth was brought into the neighbourhood and tracts of brethren setting it forth were pretty widely distributed.<a name=292:49></a> There were conversions and the truth spread and some gatherings were formed.<a name=292:50></a> But some two years ago in the town I am in, where there were many Christians connected with the Establishment, a new work went forth.<a name=292:51></a> They had learned that they were not under the law but under grace.<a name=292:52></a> There was a society employed readers and preachers.<a name=292:53></a> The clerical part of the society sought to hinder the liberty of their service and their preaching.<a name=292:54></a> Those whom God had called and who had learned what God's liberty is, could not give up their service, and they came out and laboured trusting to the Lord.<a name=292:55></a> These have been largely blessed over a pretty wide extent of country from the borders of Holland to Hesse and Nassau, perhaps some sixty or eighty miles; as has the first work I spoke of near the Rhine.<a name=292:56></a> I cannot say how many there are, but a good many hundreds of which the greater number <i>far</i> have been converted within these two years.<a name=292:57></a> The conversions, thank God, continue.<a name=292:58></a> In Hesse they are a good deal persecuted in every way.<a name=292:59></a> Lately the secretary of the local tribunal was converted.<a name=292:60></a> He was ordered out of the country in eight days; but the Lord blesses the work much.<a name=292:61></a> They have been persecuted around the country, but at present are quiet.<a name=292:62></a> The king personally favours the saints and religious liberty.<a name=292:63></a> He has received most, if not all the tracts and sent to thank me for them.<a name=292:64></a> He sent to see a brother who was in Berlin, but he was gone; perhaps the Lord so ordered it for good.<a name=292:65></a> There are here some seven or eight, more or less entirely devoted to the work, and others who labour in their neighbourhood.<a name=292:66></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It has extended into the province of Guelderland in the kingdom of Holland; the numbers are not great there, but they are getting on very happily.<a name=292:67></a> My own work in Holland was not much, but I was very happy there and felt the doors were open.<a name=292:68></a> I knew a brother who was travelling with his wife for her health -- was brought to see clearly and remained faithful and I went to visit him.<a name=292:69></a> Another was blessed through means of a French brother in Italy, and others came to see clearly through a brother in Geneva, in Switzerland.<a name=292:70></a> So does God prepare things when He is pleased to work.<a name=292:71></a> When I landed at Ostend, I could spend my Sunday with the 2nd family and we broke bread together.<a name=292:72></a> The brother, set clear in France, opened Haarlem to me and Amsterdam, so that I had intercourse with many and meetings there, and he was holding meetings at Leyden which are well attended.<a name=292:73></a> The third is in Amsterdam and I hear he as well as another also got clear (long a Christian) through the tracts and my visits; they are going on very steadily and well.<a name=292:74></a> They have broken bread together.<a name=292:75></a> I know not whether they do it regularly, as it was all new to them; but desires were awakened in many and they wish me to visit them again.<a name=292:76></a> I do not speak Dutch, so that I can only speak with those who know French or perhaps German; but that does not hinder the Lord.<a name=292:77></a> For those who receive in French communicate it to others in Dutch.<a name=292:78></a> But I was very happy in my short work there, and felt that the Lord had opened many and happy doors there.<a name=292:79></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		At Frankfurt also they meet; and at Hamburg in Lippe and nearer Frankfurt, Khenbach Bdingen, there are outposts and centres of work for brethren.<a name=292:80></a> But the Lord has strengthened and blessed the gatherings in these places, and through them and the visits of brethren the work has reached other villages also.<a name=292:81></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such, beloved brethren, is in few words a brief general account of the work.<a name=292:82></a> I rejoice to give it to the brethren; but I must beg that nothing like publicity be given to it.<a name=292:83></a> It is for brethren, for their hearts and prayers, that they may bless God and pray for the brethren that they may glorify God, that He may bless the work and guide those gathered in holiness and devotedness and love.<a name=292:84></a> But it is to be between them and God, and not to talk of to men.<a name=292:85></a> Were this done I should expect some chastening and humbling.<a name=292:86></a> I have so often seen works hindered and spoiled when brethren, perhaps with the best intentions, have made a noise about them, that I dread much anything of the sort.<a name=292:87></a> God is pretty jealous of it.<a name=292:88></a> He is working on -- man frail is full of weaknesses and shortcomings.<a name=292:89></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am sure I have felt (in my small though widely-scattered path) all sorts of feebleness of faith; but God has worked wonderfully and His blessed truth has been widely spread by it even outside those gathered.<a name=292:90></a> I ask (not a mystery) but that it may be between God and the souls of the brethren.<a name=292:91></a> Greet them heartily.<a name=292:92></a> I long to see them and hope to do so if God will.<a name=292:93></a>

		I was a lawyer; but feeling that, if the Son of God gave Himself for me I owed myself entirely to Him, and that the so-called christian world was characterised by deep ingratitude towards Him, I longed for complete devotedness to the work of the Lord, my chief thought was to get round amongst the poor Catholics of Ireland.<a name=297:6></a> I was induced to be ordained.<a name=297:7></a> I did not feel drawn to take up a regular post, but, being young in the faith and not yet knowing deliverance, I was governed by the feeling of duty towards Christ, rather than by the consciousness that <i>He</i> had done <i>all</i> and that I was redeemed and saved; consequently it was easy to follow the advice of those who were more advanced than myself in the christian world.<a name=297:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As soon as I was ordained, I went amongst the poor Irish mountaineers, in a wild and uncultivated district, where I remained two years and three months, working as best I could.<a name=297:9></a> I felt, however, that the style of work was not in agreement with what I read in the Bible concerning the church and Christianity; nor did it correspond with the effects of the action of the Spirit of God.<a name=297:10></a> These considerations pressed upon me from a scriptural and practical point of view; while seeking assiduously to fulfil the duties of the ministry confided to me, working day and night amongst the people, who were almost as wild as the mountains they inhabited.<a name=297:11></a> An accident happened which laid me aside for a time; my horse was frightened and had thrown me against a door-post.<a name=297:12></a> During my solitude conflicting thoughts increased; but much exercise of soul had the effect of causing the scriptures to gain complete ascendancy over me.<a name=297:13></a> I had always owned them to be the word of God.<a name=297:14></a>

		When I came to understand that I was united to Christ in heaven, and that, consequently, my place before God was represented by His own, I was forced to the conclusion that it was no longer a question with God of this wretched "I" which had wearied me during six or seven years, in presence of the requirements of the law.<a name=297:15></a> It then became clear to me that the church of God, as He considers it, was composed only of those who were so united to Christ, whereas Christendom, as seen externally, was really the world, and could not be considered as "the church," save as regards the responsibility attaching to the position which it professed to occupy -- a very important thing in its place.<a name=297:16></a> At the same time, I saw that the Christian, having his place in Christ in heaven, has nothing to wait for save the coming of the Saviour, in order to be set, in fact, in the glory which is already his portion in Christ.<a name=297:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The careful reading of the Acts afforded me a practical picture of the early church, which made me feel deeply the contrast with its actual present state, though still as ever, beloved by God.<a name=297:18></a> At that time I had to use crutches when moving about so that I had no longer any opportunity for making known my convictions in public; moreover, as the state of my health did not allow me to attend worship, I was compelled to remain away.<a name=297:19></a> It seemed to me that the good hand of God had thus come to my help, hiding my spiritual weakness under physical incapacity.<a name=297:20></a> In the meanwhile, there grew up in my heart the conviction that what Christianity had accomplished in the world in no way answered to the needs of a soul burdened with the sense of what God's holy governmental dealing was intended to effect.<a name=297:21></a> In my retreat, the 32nd chapter of Isaiah taught me clearly, on God's behalf, that there was still an economy to come, of His ordering; a state of things in no way established as yet.<a name=297:22></a> The consciousness of my union with Christ had given me the present heavenly portion of the glory, whereas this chapter clearly sets forth the corresponding earthly part.<a name=297:23></a> I was not able to put these things in their respective places or arrange them in order, as I can now; but the truths themselves were then revealed of God, through the action of His Spirit, by reading His word.<a name=297:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What was to be done?<a name=297:25></a> I saw in that word the coming of Christ to take the church to Himself in glory.<a name=297:26></a> I saw there the cross, the divine basis of salvation, which should impress its own character on the Christian and on the church in view of the Lord's coming; and also that meanwhile the Holy Spirit was given to be the source of the unity of the church, as well as the spring of its activity, and indeed of all christian energy.<a name=297:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards the gospel, I had no difficulty as to its receive dogmas.<a name=297:28></a> Three persons in one God, the divinity of Jesus, His work of atonement on the cross, His resurrection, His session at the right hand of God, were truths which, understood as orthodox doctrines, had long been a living reality to my soul.<a name=297:29></a> They were the known and felt conditions, the actualities, of my relationship with God.<a name=297:30></a> Not only were they truths, but I knew God personally in that way; I had no other God but Him who had thus revealed Himself, and Him I had.<a name=297:31></a> He was the God of my life and of my worship, the God of my peace, the only true God.<a name=297:32></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The practical difference in my preaching, when once I began to preach again, was as follows: When a parson, I had preached that sin had created a great gulf between us and God, and that Christ alone was able to bridge it over; now, I preached that He <i>had</i> already finished His work.<a name=297:33></a> The necessity of regeneration, which was always a part of my teaching, became connected more with Christ, the last Adam, and I understood better that it was a real life, entirely new, communicated by the power of the Holy Spirit; but, as I have said, more in connection with the person of Christ and the power of His resurrection, combining the power of a life victorious over death, with a new position for man before God.<a name=297:34></a> This is what I understand by "deliverance.<a name=297:35></a>" The blood of Jesus has removed every spot from the believer; every trace of sin, according to God's own purity.<a name=297:36></a> In virtue of His blood-shedding, the only possible propitiation, we may now invite all men to come to God, a God of love, who for this object, has given His own Son.<a name=297:37></a> The presence of the Holy Ghost, sent from heaven to abide in the believer as the "unction," the "seal," and the "earnest of our inheritance," as well as being in the church, the power which unites it in one body and distributes gifts to the members according to His will; these truths developed largely and assumed great importance in my eyes.<a name=297:38></a> With this last truth was connected the question of ministry.<a name=297:39></a> From whence came this ministry?<a name=297:40></a> According to the Bible, it clearly came from God by the free and powerful action of the Holy Ghost.<a name=297:41></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		At the time I was occupied with these things, the person with whom I was in christian relation locally, as a minister, was an excellent Christian, worthy of all respect, and one for whom I have always had a great affection.<a name=297:42></a> I do not know if he is still living, but since the time I speak of, he was appointed to be archdeacon.<a name=297:43></a> It was, however, the principles, and not the persons, which acted on my conscience- for I had already given up, out of love to the Saviour, all that the world could offer I said to myself: "If the Apostle Paul were to come here now he would not, according to the established system, be even allowed to preach, not being legally ordained; but if a worker of Satan, who, by his doctrine, denied the Saviour, came here he could freely preach, and my christian friend would be obliged to consider him as a fellow-labourer; whereas he would be unable to recognise the most powerful instrument of the Spirit of God, however much blessed in his work of leading multitudes of souls to the Lord, if he had not been ordained according to the system.<a name=297:44></a>" All this, said I to myself, is false.<a name=297:45></a> This is not mere abuse, such as may be found everywhere; it is the principle of the system that is at fault.<a name=297:46></a> Ministry is of the Spirit.<a name=297:47></a> There are some, amongst the clergy, who are ministers by the Spirit but the system is founded on an opposite principle; consequently it seemed impossible to remain in it any longer.<a name=297:48></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I saw in scripture that there were certain <i>gifts</i> which formed true ministry, in contrast to a clergy established upon another principle.<a name=297:49></a> Salvation, the church, and ministry, all were bound together; and all were connected with Christ, the Head of the church in heaven, with Christ who had accomplished a perfect salvation, as well as with the presence of the Spirit on earth, uniting the members to the Head, and to each other, so as to form "one body," and He acting in them according to His will.<a name=297:50></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In effect, the cross of Christ and His return should characterise the church and each one of the members.<a name=297:51></a> What was to be done?<a name=297:52></a> Where was this unity, this "body"?<a name=297:53></a> Where was the power of the Spirit recognised?<a name=297:54></a> Where was the Lord really waited for?<a name=297:55></a> Nationalism was associated with the world; in its bosom some believers were merged in the very world from which Jesus had separated them; they were, besides, separated from one another, whilst Jesus had united them.<a name=297:56></a> The Lord's supper, symbol of the unity of the body, had become a symbol of the union of this latter with the world, that is to say, exactly the contrary of what Christ had established.<a name=297:57></a> Dissent had, no doubt, had the effect of making the true children of God more manifest, but here they were united on principles quite different from the unity of the body of Christ.<a name=297:58></a> If I joined myself to these, I separated myself from others everywhere.<a name=297:59></a> The disunion of the body of Christ was everywhere apparent rather than its unity.<a name=297:60></a> What was I to do?<a name=297:61></a> Such was the question which presented itself to me, without any other idea than that of satisfying my conscience, according to the light of the word of God.<a name=297:62></a> A word in Matthew 18 furnished the solution of my trouble: "Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.<a name=297:63></a>" This was just what I wanted: the presence of Jesus was assured at such worship; it is there He has recorded His name, as He had done of old in the temple at Jerusalem for those who were called to resort there.<a name=297:64></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Four persons who were pretty much in the same state of soul as myself, came together to my lodging; we spoke together about these things, and I proposed to them to break bread the following Sunday, which we did.<a name=297:65></a> Others then joined us.<a name=297:66></a> I left Dublin soon after, but the work immediately began at Limerick, a town in Ireland, and then in other places.<a name=297:67></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Two years later (1830), I went to Cambridge and Oxford.<a name=297:68></a> In this latter place, some persons who are still engaged in the work, shared my convictions, and felt that the relation of the church to Christ ought to be that of a faithful spouse.<a name=297:69></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		By invitation I went to Plymouth to preach.<a name=297:70></a> My habit was to preach wherever people wished, whether in buildings or in private houses.<a name=297:71></a> More than once, even with ministers of the national church, we have broken bread on Monday evening after meetings for christian edification, where each was free to read, to speak, to pray, or to give out a hymn.<a name=297:72></a> Some months afterwards we began to do so on Sunday morning, making use of the same liberty, only adding the Lord's supper, which we had, and still have, the practice of taking every Sunday.<a name=297:73></a> Occasionally it has been partaken of more often.<a name=297:74></a> About that time also some began to do the same in London.<a name=297:75></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The unity of the church, as the body of Christ, the coming of the Lord, the presence of the Holy Ghost here below, in the individual and in the church; an assiduous proclamation of the truth, as well as the preaching of the gospel on the ground of pure grace and that of an accomplished work, giving in consequence the assurance of salvation when received into the heart by the Spirit; practical separation from the world; devotedness to Christ, as to Him who has redeemed the church a walk having Him only as the motive and rule; and other subjects in connection with these -- all this has been treated of in separate publications as well as by means of periodicals; and these truths have been largely spread abroad.<a name=297:76></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A good many ministers of the national church left nationalism in order to walk according to these principles, and England became gradually covered with meetings, more or less numerous.<a name=297:77></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Plymouth being the place where most of the publications originated, the name "Plymouth brethren" became the usual appellation given to such meetings.<a name=297:78></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In 1837 I visited Switzerland, and these truths began to be known there.<a name=297:79></a> I returned there more than once.<a name=297:80></a> The second time, I remained a considerable time at Lausanne, where God worked in conversions, and gathered a number of the children of God out of the world.<a name=297:81></a> There were already, in Switzerland Dissenters who had suffered faithfully for the Lord during twenty years previously.<a name=297:82></a> But their activity had declined considerably, and it even seemed that the movement was about to disappear.<a name=297:83></a> The work of the brethren has, to a certain extent by the goodness of God, filled the country, conversions having been numerous.<a name=297:84></a> In German Switzerland, the work spread to a much less degree.<a name=297:85></a> On two occasions of my spending a protracted time in Lausanne, some young brothers who desired to devote themselves to gospel work spent nearly a year with me in order to read the Bible.<a name=297:86></a> We also partook of the Lord's supper together every day.<a name=297:87></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		At the same time, quite independently of what was going on in Switzerland, a brother who was labouring in France had awakened an interest in a considerable district where the people were, in general, plunged in infidelity and darkness.<a name=297:88></a> Some also of the young brothers of whom I have spoken, and two or three others whose acquaintance I made, but who never stayed with me, went to work in France.<a name=297:89></a> Other labourers, belonging to societies, believing that they would be happier working under the Lord's immediate direction, and not as subject to committees, gave up their salaries, considering such arrangements to be unknown, both in fact and in principle, to the scriptures, since their very existence attributed to the possession of money the right to direct the work of the Lord: these began to work in simple dependence upon the Lord, trusting to His faithful care.<a name=297:90></a> God raised up others also, though it still remains true that "the harvest is great and the labourers are few.<a name=297:91></a>" God has blessed these labourers by conversions, numerous, thank God, especially in the south of France.<a name=297:92></a> From the beginning I have visited these countries and shared with joy the troubles and fatigues of these brothers; but it is they who have actually laboured at the work.<a name=297:93></a> In some places, I had the first troubles; in others I have only visited, taken part and helped, when the work was, thank God already begun.<a name=297:94></a> He gave us to be of one heart and one soul, mutually to be helpers of one another, seeking the good of all, whilst recognising our individual weakness.<a name=297:95></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Almost about the same time, in the eastern part of France, a like work had begun, independently of this one.<a name=297:96></a> It has also been visited, so that at the present time the work extends from Ble to the Pyrnes, with a fairly large gap in the districts of which Toulouse forms the centre.<a name=297:97></a> The country is more or less covered with meetings, and the work, by God's grace, is still going on.<a name=297:98></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I ought to say that I have never meddled in any way with the calling nor with the work of the brethren who studied the Bible with me.<a name=297:99></a> As regards some, I have the conviction that they had not been called to it, and they have, in fact, gone back into the ordinary routine of life.<a name=297:100></a> As to others, I only helped them in the study of the Bible, in communicating to them the light which God had given me, but leaving entirely to themselves the responsibility of their calling for the work of evangelisation or teaching.<a name=297:101></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We had the custom of gathering together occasionally for some time, when God opened the way for it, to study scriptural subjects together, or books of the Bible, and to communicate to one another what God had given to each.<a name=297:102></a> During several years, in Ireland and England, this took place annually in large conferences which lasted for a week.<a name=297:103></a> On the Continent, and latterly in England, they have been less attended; and consequently, with fewer numbers, it has been possible to spend a fortnight or three weeks studying some books of the Bible.<a name=297:104></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My elder brother, who is a Christian, spent two years at Dusseldorf.<a name=297:105></a> He is engaged in the work of the Lord, wherever he may happen to be at the moment.<a name=297:106></a> He has been blessed to several souls in the neighbourhood of Dusseldorf.<a name=297:107></a> These, in their turn, have spread the light of the gospel and the truth, and a certain number of persons have been gathered in the Rhenish provinces.<a name=297:108></a> Tracts and various publications of the brethren have been translated and largely distributed; and light as to the soul's deliverance, the true character of the church the presence of the Holy Ghost here below, and the Lord's return, has been disseminated.<a name=297:109></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Two years later, helped, I believe, by the knowledge of these truths, but entirely independent of this work, a movement of the Spirit of God began at Elberfeld.<a name=297:110></a> There was in that town a "Brotherhood" which employed twelve labourers, if I am not mistaken, whom the clergy sought to forbid from preaching or teaching.<a name=297:111></a> Enlightened as to the ministry of the Spirit, and moved by love for souls, they would not submit to this interdict.<a name=297:112></a> Seven of these labourers, I believe, and a few members of the "Brotherhood" detached themselves from it, and certain of them, with others whom God raised up, continued their gospel work, which spread from Holland to Hesse.<a name=297:113></a> Conversions have been very numerous, and many hundreds assemble at the present time to break bread.<a name=297:114></a> More recently the work has begun to get established in Holland, as also in the south of Germany.<a name=297:115></a> By means of other instruments, two meetings in Wrtemberg already existed.<a name=297:116></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Gospel preaching in Switzerland and England has led to the formation of some meetings amongst emigrants to the United States and Canada; the evangelisation of negroes led to others in Jamaica and Demerara, as also amongst the natives of Brazil, through a brother who went there and has since died.<a name=297:117></a> I am not aware of any other who knows the language sufficiently to continue this work, which has been blessed.<a name=297:118></a> The English colonies of Australia have also meetings; but this sketch will be sufficient for you.<a name=297:119></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Brethren do not recognise any other body but the body of Christ, that is to say, the whole church of the firstborn.<a name=297:120></a> Also they recognise every Christian who walks in truth and holiness, as a proved member of Christ.<a name=297:121></a> Their hope of final salvation is founded on the Saviour's expiatory work, for whose return they look, according to His word.<a name=297:122></a> They believe the saints to be united to Him already, as the body of which He is the Head, and they await the accomplishment of His promise, expecting His coming to take them to Himself in the Father's house, so that where He is, there they may be also.<a name=297:123></a> Meanwhile, they have to bear His cross and to suffer with Him, separated from the world which has rejected Him.<a name=297:124></a> His person is the object of their faith, His life the example which they have to follow in their conduct.<a name=297:125></a> His word, namely, the scriptures inspired of God, that is to say the Bible, is the authority which forms their faith; it is also its foundation, and they recognise it as that which should govern their conduct.<a name=297:126></a> The Holy Ghost alone can make it effectual both for life and practice.<a name=297:127></a><br>185 -- .<a name=297:128></a>

		[W K] DEAREST BROTHER, -- .<a name=306:1></a>.<a name=306:2></a>.<a name=306:3></a> As far as I have seen <i>everywhere</i>, this connection with Bethesda is united with the returning influence of the world and, through the appearance of devotedness at B.<a name=306:4></a>, united to real worldliness, that is, a fair show in the flesh, universally falseness, want of openness and straightforwardness.<a name=306:5></a> It is a question of deliverance of souls from the deception of a system I left long ago, somewhat painted over.<a name=306:6></a> I have not a trace of doubt as to its character.<a name=306:7></a> It may be a matter of humiliation that there was not more power to stay and keep it out, but its character is clear to me as the sun at noonday.<a name=306:8></a> I have no more thought of walking with it than of abandoning all the principles on which grace has made me act these thirty years.<a name=306:9></a> But separation is a very serious thing, or rather the attempt to form a second table, as men speak; because if the Lord removes the candlestick, He does not always light up another.<a name=306:10></a> It is not His way; He is judging and removing it, and power is needed for lighting it up.<a name=306:11></a> Conscientiousness though equally honoured of God, is not this.<a name=306:12></a> Great quietness and isolatedness is the path called for in such cases.<a name=306:13></a> I met today, in a French tract which had no reference to these matters, a principle I have always accepted, that I would never separate where I could recognise the body as on the principle of the church of God after I had left it; and the principle is an evident and plain one.<a name=306:14></a> I might avoid going to the place if I could do nothing better.<a name=306:15></a> When one has to separate, then quietness and retiredness is the path till God comes in afresh .<a name=306:16></a>.<a name=306:17></a>.<a name=306:18></a> .<a name=306:19></a> Things always find their level, individual level, in a sifting.<a name=306:20></a>

		J H Eccles, It is a great mistake to think that I am less decided as to neutrals; it is quite the contrary.<a name=307:1></a> Neutrals, when Christ has been dishonoured, are in the worst position of all, and I think Christ has been dishonoured, I mean at Bethesda.<a name=307:2></a> I do not understand how any one caring for Him can think otherwise, and I believe the Lord is distinctly putting His seal on those who are faithful, and that the <i>moral</i> standing of those who are not is <i>lowering</i> every day.<a name=307:3></a> That is not saying that there are not a great many faults among those who have stood firm, but failure on a sound standard is a very different thing, bad as it is, from lowering the standard.<a name=307:4></a> -- wrote to me inviting me to Barnstaple, to come and have intercourse, more than half a year ago: I wrote word when the dishonour done to Christ was judged, till then not.<a name=307:5></a> I leave myself, of course, entirely open to meet any one when the Lord leads to it; but it will not, the Lord helping, be on the ground of being not decided as to neutrals.<a name=307:6></a> My principle is the same as ever; my experience has made me more so .<a name=307:7></a>.<a name=307:8></a>.<a name=307:9></a> .<a name=307:10></a>

		DEAR MISS -- , -- Your question depends on many points in the state of the soul.<a name=309:1></a> The first question would be -- have you ever got settled assurance of conscience before God so that that should be true of you which is said, "The worshippers once purged should have no more conscience of sins"?<a name=309:2></a> When we have not this, every fault mixes itself up with the question of the light in which God views us, and the question is not restoration, but recovering some sense of standing before God, which is a very different one.<a name=309:3></a> God is not really known in love, though we may believe generally that He is so since He has visited us in mercy.<a name=309:4></a> If I am not out of Egypt, that is, if I have not a clear knowledge of God as a redeeming God, and I am looking to God who defends me against His judgment by blood, my thought of Him is yet wholly imperfect, my failures give fears, not pain properly, to my spirit.<a name=309:5></a> The great point is then to know and believe that He has redeemed us in love, and taken us in the resurrection of Christ out of the whole state and condition I was in before; that He justifies me, not that I am justified before Him -- and both are right, but the former only is liberty.<a name=309:6></a> When this is fully known love is never doubted, but we are brought to feel it is grieved; but it is therefore still known to be there; and hence, when the heart really looks to Him it is soon restored, though the Lord may keep it so long in suspense, as to communion, as may be necessary to probe the heart as much as needed.<a name=309:7></a> If you have the full assurance that God is love to you at all times, the witness of His Spirit in communion will soon be restored to you.<a name=309:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is another question.<a name=309:9></a> When I have not a positive sin on my conscience, I cannot properly excommunicate myself.<a name=309:10></a> Hence, the separating myself (as to profession outwardly, of course, I mean) from the unity of the body of Christ, of which the Lord's supper is the sign, is a very serious thing; and we are not justified in doing it except on very positive ground.<a name=309:11></a> If I felt there had been serious neglect of God, and He was positively dealing with me seriously about my sin, I should rather stay away, but it is a very serious thing when once one sees that it is the unity of Christ's body; but then one ought to take up the matter very seriously indeed with one's self.<a name=309:12></a> In many, the abstaining from communion is much too light a matter.<a name=309:13></a> On the other hand, if it be as is the case in some souls, only a distrust of God's love, of which the enemy is taking advantage, abstaining from it would only increase the uncertainty of soul.<a name=309:14></a> The word of scripture is not, Let a man examine himself, whether he should eat, but, "Let a man examine himself, and so let him eat.<a name=309:15></a>" This is the general rule; not to do it lightly -- but, in judging evil, to do it.<a name=309:16></a> If the peace I first spoke of is not possessed, we cannot judge rightly, because restoring love is not known.<a name=309:17></a> The first great question for you is, Do you know really the love of God in an assured conscience (not merely attracted heart)?<a name=309:18></a> If so, I should say, go -- but do it seriously, so as not to trifle with any evil -- unless some definite dealing of God with you about evil be in hand, then you would do well to refrain till that be settled.<a name=309:19></a> I know not whether speaking thus generally (I could only do this, of course) will be of any avail.<a name=309:20></a> Look to the Lord; He will guide the meek in judgment, and such as are humble them will He teach His way; and trust His love, only truly judge yourself.<a name=309:21></a> If I can be of any further use I shall be happy.<a name=309:22></a>

		The table is the place of full communion; but it is a different thing to stay away voluntarily, when one is there, and to hesitate in going at first.<a name=309:24></a> Seek whether you have ever had your conscience fully at peace with God, and then, daily power for communion, which is surely in Christ for you when walking in the way of God's will.<a name=309:25></a>

		Mons.<a name=310:1></a> Pignet, The common notion is that brotherly love is charity, and indeed its most perfect form: this is a mistake, as this passage (2 Peter 1: 7) shews.<a name=310:2></a> That brotherly love is a most sweet and precious fruit of grace, is most true -- precious in the heart that is filled with it, and precious in its mutual development; but it is not charity.<a name=310:3></a> We are told to add to brotherly love charity.<a name=310:4></a> The reason is simple: if brotherly love, brethren are the object, and though when genuine and pure it surely flows from grace, it easily in us clothes itself with the character which its object gives it, and tends to limit itself to the objects with which it is occupied, and be governed by its feeling towards them.<a name=310:5></a> It is apt to end in its objects, and thus avoid all that might be painful to them, or mar the mutual feeling and pleasantness of intercourse, and thus make them the measure of the conduct of the Christian.<a name=310:6></a> In a word, where brotherly love ends in itself, as the main object, brethren become the motive and governing principle of our conduct; and our conduct as uncertain as the state of our brethren with whom we may be in contact.<a name=310:7></a> Hence the apostle says, "Above all these put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness"; and another apostle, "And to brotherly kindness charity.<a name=310:8></a>" Now charity is love; but will not this seek to exercise brotherly kindness?<a name=310:9></a> Undoubtedly it will, but it brings in God.<a name=310:10></a> "God is love.<a name=310:11></a>" "He that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.<a name=310:12></a>" Hence it brings in a standard of what true love is, which mere brotherly kindness in itself never can.<a name=310:13></a> It is the bond of perfectness, for God, and God in active love is its measure.<a name=310:14></a> Brotherly kindness by itself has the brother for the object: charity is governed by, exists in virtue of the conscious presence of God; hence whatever is not consistent with His presence, with Himself, with His glory, cannot be borne by the heart who is filled with it.<a name=310:15></a> It is in the spirit of love that it thinks and works, but in the Spirit of God, by whose presence it is inwardly known and active.<a name=310:16></a> Love was active in Christ when He said, "Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers"; in Paul when he said, I would that they were even cut off which trouble you.<a name=310:17></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Charity, because it is God's presence, and that we feel His presence, and look to Him in it, is intolerant of evil.<a name=310:18></a> In mere brotherly kindness, the brother being the object before my mind (and, if God's presence be not felt, we do not realise it, nature coming in so easily and here in its most unsuspected and kindly shapes), I put man before God, smother up evil, keep kindness going, at any rate so far exclude and shut out God.<a name=310:19></a> Charity is His active presence though it will be in love to man- but it gives to God all His rights.<a name=310:20></a> He it is that is love, but He is never inconsistent with Himself.<a name=310:21></a> His love to us was shewn in what was the most solemn proof of His intolerance of evil, the cross.<a name=310:22></a> There is no true love apart from righteousness.<a name=310:23></a> If God is indifferent to evil, is not righteous, then there is no love in grace to the sinner.<a name=310:24></a> If He abhors evil, cannot suffer it in His presence, then His dealings with us as sinners shew the most perfect love.<a name=310:25></a> If I have ten children, and they go wrong, and I say, 'Well, I am to shew love to them,' and I take no account of their evil ways; or if some of them go wrong and I treat them as if there was no difference to my mind in their well doing or evil doing; this is not love but carelessness as to evil.<a name=310:26></a> This is the kind of love looked for by unconverted man, namely, God's being as careless as to evil as they are; but this is not divine charity which abhors the evil, but rises over it, dealing with it either in putting it away or in needed chastenings.<a name=310:27></a> Now if God were indifferent to evil there is no holy being to be the object of my love -- nothing sanctifying.<a name=310:28></a> God does not own as love what admits of sin.<a name=310:29></a>

		There is a wrong spirit of judgment: if I occupy myself needlessly in thinking of others, and expressing an opinion of them; if in questionable cases I ascribe, even in my mind, wrong motives; nay, if I do not hope in such cases that the right motive is at bottom, I am in the spirit of judgment, and away from God.<a name=312:26></a> If severity of judgment on the person, when I am bound to judge he is faulty, possesses my soul, thus is not the Spirit of God.<a name=312:27></a> But to weaken the plain, unequivocal and avowed estimate of right and wrong under the pretence of not judging; or to deny the knowledge of one another, and mutual love among the saints, under pretence that we have not a right to judge, is of the enemy, and a mere cover to a man's conscience to avoid the conscious pressure of that judgment on himself.<a name=312:28></a> If I am to maintain a divine standard of right and wrong, I must judge those who do wrong to be doing so.<a name=312:29></a> I am not always called to occupy myself about them -- then, if volunteered, the spirit of judgment comes: but if I am, I must judge according to the word of God.<a name=312:30></a> If I am to love the disciples of Jesus, the saints of God, "the brotherhood," I must know who they are If there is a disposition to distrust, or to impute motives, then the spirit of judgment is at work.<a name=312:31></a>

		Dearest W Kelly, -- As regards the introduction of Matthew's version into Luke (11); it is remarkable enough that it is in the Itala and not in the Vulgate.<a name=314:1></a> Its presence in D is thus understood.<a name=314:2></a> It is a practical Latin arrangement.<a name=314:3></a> C however has it, not latinised, but has it substantially.<a name=314:4></a> A, I think, fails here.<a name=314:5></a> Jerome doubtless corrected from Eastern copies for the Vulgate.<a name=314:6></a> I cannot therefore myself doubt that B etc.<a name=314:7></a> have it right.<a name=314:8></a> All seem to be agreed as to "Deliver us from the wicked one" not being there, at least Scholz, who does not accept other changes.<a name=314:9></a> But I think Luke, who always takes up the general present principles of the kingdom and not its dispensational arrival, would very naturally leave out a phrase which I apprehend has special reference to Satan's power in that day.<a name=314:10></a> Saving out of temptation, watching and praying lest we enter, is clearly of all times: deliverance from the wicked one is when he has special power, as he has for a short time.<a name=314:11></a>

		But, on the other hand, it is a mistake to think we partake by breaking the bread, or that we break it.<a name=315:6></a> The whole force of the thing consists (as to this point) in our partaking of already broken bread.<a name=315:7></a> It is His body broken for us that we take and eat.<a name=315:8></a> We are not the breakers of His body, properly speaking.<a name=315:9></a> So that, I apprehend, the true partaking of the Lord's supper is after the bread is broken.<a name=315:10></a> The breaking of the bread now is, of course, a necessary accident to such participation, but is no part of the communion at all.<a name=315:11></a> And every one acquainted with scripture on the point, knows that "blessing" means simply giving thanks, and not consecrating the bread.<a name=315:12></a> See 1 Corinthians 11: 24 and compare Matthew 26: 26, 27; Mark 14: 22; and Luke 22: 19.<a name=315:13></a> So in Luke 9: 16, the miracle of the loaves and not the Eucharist, He blessed them and brake; in John 6: 11, 23 Mark 8: 6, 7 (also Mark 6: 41), the terms are united; in Matthew 14: 19 He blessed, and in chapter 15: 36 gave thanks.<a name=315:14></a> In 1 Corinthians 14: 16 we find incontestable proof of what indeed the previous passages can leave no doubt on to a reasonable mind.<a name=315:15></a> "Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?<a name=315:16></a>" Blessing is blessing God, a giving of thanks.<a name=315:17></a> So the apostle says, in chapter 11, "the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread; and when he had given thanks," and in 1 Corinthians 10 "the cup of blessing which we bless.<a name=315:18></a>" Matthew and Mark, speaking of the bread, say He blessed; and speaking of the cup, say He gave thanks.<a name=315:19></a> In Luke it is simply, He gave thanks.<a name=315:20></a> Thus, the blessing which precedes the breaking of the bread is a giving of thanks; and in this, of course, all join, as in every thanksgiving, though one may utter it.<a name=315:21></a> Every saint is essentially competent, though in a large congregation godly order of mind may leave it to such as may have justly earned the respect of the body; yet, as the feeling of priesthood is readily slipped into, I should think it desirable that it were not always one.<a name=315:22></a>

		The <i>breaking</i> of the bread is in itself no religious act; it represents the putting of Christ to death, and, as an outward act, was consummated by wicked men.<a name=315:23></a> But the Lord did break it in the last supper, shewing it was a dead Christ they had to feed on; and hence he who gives thanks breaks the bread.<a name=315:24></a> The communion comes after and is on a broken body.<a name=315:25></a> The breaking is the killing of Christ, and though absolutely necessary as a figure, because His death was absolutely necessary and is the very point shewn forth, yet the act of doing it is no religious part of the thing which one has a privilege in doing.<a name=315:26></a> And as to pouring out the wine, it is done no doubt often, but is no part of the Lord's supper at all.<a name=315:27></a> The wine is, in the institution, supposed to be already in the cup, still pointing to the great fact, that the communion refers to an already dead Saviour.<a name=315:28></a> The blood is out of the body -- "my blood which is shed for you.<a name=315:29></a>" The act of pouring out would not represent death, because the body is not thus represented, and hence it is not referred to at all.<a name=315:30></a> The already shed blood is given thanks for or blessed, already poured out: "the cup which we bless," etc.<a name=315:31></a> There is the breaking of the bread as significative of the breaking of His body; but this is preparatory to communion.<a name=315:32></a>

		It is this consideration which shews the terrible import of the Roman Catholic doctrine as to the Eucharist, and how Satan has taken them in their own wisdom and, so to speak, mocked them.<a name=315:33></a> The laity are deprived of the cup and are consoled by what is called the doctrine of concomitancy; namely, that the body, blood, soul, and divinity of Jesus are in the bread (indeed in both species).<a name=315:34></a> But if the blood be in the body, and not shed and separate, <i>there is no redemption</i>.<a name=315:35></a> It is shed blood, not blood in the body, which is the power of redemption; without shedding of blood there is <i>none</i>.<a name=315:36></a> This confirms the view, taken above, that it is a body already broken, and blood already shed, of which we partake.<a name=315:37></a> Thus, though the bread must be broken as it was by Christ, by him who gives thanks, this is but preparatory and forms, strictly, no part of the communion; and, as representing the putting Christ to death, it is no part of the holy service itself, though needed to shew that it is of a dead Christ we partake: it is of no living, existing Christ, but of a dead Christ, and there is none such.<a name=315:38></a> Remark further, how this sets aside transubstantiation and consubstantiation; for no such Christ exists as that celebrated in the Eucharist.<a name=315:39></a> As in the Passover a slain lamb, so a dead Christ is represented there, and shed blood; but there is no dead Christ now, He is alive again for evermore.<a name=315:40></a> As risen with Him, we remember the sorrows and sufferings which gave us a place there.<a name=315:41></a> That atoning death is accomplished and passed, and sin is put away for us, and we are alive with Him for evermore.<a name=315:42></a>

		I feel what a world of sorrow it is, and how real a share you have in that sorrow; but a world where, if sin and sorrow have entered in, grace has come in after them; and now love has risen above all the sin and sorrow, and, having entered into the worst of all it could bring on us, has given us a place out of it all: into the place from which it flowed the spirit of your dear wife has entered, and is with Him who entered into all that sorrow here that He might deliver us from it all; and, if you remain in the scenes of it down here, that very love has revealed itself by coming down <i>into them</i> that we might have it here.<a name=318:4></a> Jesus was a man of sorrows, and indeed none like His.<a name=318:5></a> And His love is perfect sympathy as well as deliverance.<a name=318:6></a> Look to this, dear brother, and you will find it in your sorrow, and raising you out of it, not by destroying the feeling, but by coming into it, taking all human will out of it which causes regret and bitterness, and bringing His will into it, and Himself in love with us in it.<a name=318:7></a> His grace is sure, in its path does not fail; nothing escapes or happens without it.<a name=318:8></a> This.<a name=318:9></a> is a great comfort -- first our will, subtle as it is and meddling with the best affections, is broken and there is submission; then comes the sense of positive love.<a name=318:10></a> Any sense of failure even on our part, if such there be, is lost in the sense of the perfect love and ordering of God.<a name=318:11></a> He takes the place of the reasoning of our minds and all is peace.<a name=318:12></a> This is a wonderful thing, for after all even as to our ways we cannot answer Him nor account for one of a thousand.<a name=318:13></a> He does use all to set our hearts right, and gives softened peace like a river.<a name=318:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I will not trespass on you, dear brother, with many words at this moment.<a name=318:15></a> Only look to Jesus, and believe in and count on the love of God towards yourself -- towards her there is no difficulty, she is where all is clear -- for your dear little ones and believe that He is sufficient, and wait upon Him who knows our sorrows and difficulties and trials.<a name=318:16></a> Be assured of my unfeigned sympathy, for indeed I feel that your loss has been very great, but I am sure my God is able to supply all your need according to His riches in glory.<a name=318:17></a> Peace be with you: be much with Jesus, and the God of peace shall keep your heart.<a name=318:18></a>

		J A Von Poseck, Our partaking of the divine nature is a real<a href="#320:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> thing.<a name=320:1></a> "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.<a name=320:2></a>" All are born of God.<a name=320:3></a> Christ is become our life: He is "that eternal life which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us"; and hence it can be said, "Which thing is true in him and in you.<a name=320:4></a>" But that "light was the light of men.<a name=320:5></a>" Christ was "the image of the invisible God.<a name=320:6></a>" This life was a true, moral, subsisting thing, which could be communicated.<a name=320:7></a> There is a divine power in it which contains and unfolds all things that pertain to life and godliness.<a name=320:8></a> It is faith which lays hold, by the power of the Spirit of God, on that which is life, that is, Christ.<a name=320:9></a> We are "the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.<a name=320:10></a>" Christ is the Word -- the expression and revelation of all that is in God; and we, in knowing Him, are renewed in knowledge after the image of Him that created us.<a name=320:11></a> The word, as a testimony, is the seed of life when brought into the heart by the power of the Holy Ghost; because it is the revelation of Christ, and the bringing in, by that power, of Christ livingly there.<a name=320:12></a> It is Christ, by the word, by faith, in the power of the Holy Ghost, the operation being the operation of God.<a name=320:13></a> But it is by the revelation of Christ.<a name=320:14></a> Hence, we are said to be begotten by the incorruptible seed of the word (1 Peter 1: 23); and James 1: 18, "Of his own will begat he us by the word of truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.<a name=320:15></a>" And so it is expressed here.<a name=320:16></a> Grace and peace are to be multiplied, "through the Knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord, according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us by glory and virtue, whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises, that by these ye might be made partakers of the divine nature.<a name=320:17></a>" It is not a law to flesh, calling them to walk rightly where man already was; but a call by glory and virtue to get on to this new place of peace in which Christ is, and that by the revelation of Him glorified, and the assurance of our portion in it.<a name=320:18></a> But thus, by divine power, it is livingly communicated to the soul.<a name=320:19></a> But this is the glory of the divine nature in a man, into which we are to be formed: but we are livingly formed by its revelation in the power of the Holy Ghost now.<a name=320:20></a> It is the real communication of the divine nature.<a name=320:21></a> Only Peter looks at it, even in its affections, desires, qualities, as under the impress of the revelation of Christ, rather than as the simple fact of life.<a name=320:22></a> But all scripture tells the same truth.<a name=320:23></a> For every nature has its own character, knowledge by which it lives and is formed, its tastes, and spirit, and objects, which make it what it is, though its existence is the first and wonderful truth.<a name=320:24></a><br>[1860.<a name=320:25></a>]

		J A Von Poseck Two things require to be noticed in replying.<a name=321:1></a><a href="#321:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> First, the supposition of the same degree of knowledge in all is quite, as it seems to me, unfounded.<a name=321:2></a> Secondly, we are little aware of the immense difference of common knowledge current in the church by the presence of the Holy Ghost -- that unction from the Holy One by which we know all things, which will not be then thus present with the remnant; though He will act in producing longings after deliverance and good in the hearts of the remnant, and directing their thoughts to the scriptures of truth, with an intelligence which the cravings of want alone give.<a name=321:3></a> Another point to be noticed is that there are wise ones, who "instruct the many in righteousness" -- wise ones who understand.<a name=321:4></a> How many now appreciate the real calling and standing of the church of God?<a name=321:5></a> The godly of that day will cry to Jehovah in their distress, and the more profoundly convinced they are of their sins, the more will they understand the prophetic declarations.<a name=321:6></a> They are directed to the law and the testimony, all that is in the Old Testament, and all short of the church, I apprehend, in the New Testament open to them, such as Matthew and Hebrews.<a name=321:7></a> Certainly all concerning Christ, as revealed in prophecy, is before them.<a name=321:8></a> They will not understand personal forgiveness and acceptance till they see Him: the rejection of Messiah they may feel as their national guilt.<a name=321:9></a> How many now have not found personal acceptance with God?<a name=321:10></a> The repentance after seeing Him will be wholly different in nature and kind from that before; it will be under grace, and less egotistic.<a name=321:11></a> Psalm 8 can be only <i>hope</i>, with a question -- shall I be there?<a name=321:12></a> But the thought of Messiah, as they have not pardon, will be at the utmost as in an awakened soul who has not the Spirit -- the sense of a guilty nation, uncertain whether they will participate in a blessing which faith believes will come.<a name=321:13></a> The degree of the sense of guilt will, of course, vary.<a name=321:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I apprehend the Psalms are specially calculated to minister expression and direction to their feelings in that day.<a name=321:15></a> Isaiah 53 gives hope to the nation, not peace then to the individual.<a name=321:16></a> They may know from Psalm 68 that He is gone to heaven, from Psalm 110 that He is at the right hand of God.<a name=321:17></a> How little the Jews understood it we learn from the Saviour's question.<a name=321:18></a> (Matthew 22: 43) But though there will be individual wants, the nation, their common lot, will be more in their thoughts than personal forgiveness and peace; God's government rather than individual salvation.<a name=321:19></a> And all is coloured by this.<a name=321:20></a> When they see Him, each will mourn apart.<a name=321:21></a> Some, I hardly doubt, will have seized the Old Testament instruction as to Christ -- perhaps those who are killed and taken up, the saints of the high places.<a name=321:22></a> Yet even they will, as to their testimony, be more associated with the God of the earth than we.<a name=321:23></a> As regards Daniel, the wise will understand.<a name=321:24></a> But he does not speak of atonement nor any passage I know but Isaiah 53; and that is for the nation as they would then understand it.<a name=321:25></a> I cannot doubt the guilt of a rejected Messiah will shine in on some souls as regards the nation.<a name=321:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The difficulty for a Christian is to enter into the state and habits of thought of those concerned in these prophecies in that day.<a name=321:27></a> It is clear that all the Old Testament prophecies will be before them.<a name=321:28></a> But the Holy Ghost, not dwelling in them to guide into all truth, they will seek in distress of soul the answer to their need and circumstances with the feelings of a people.<a name=321:29></a> And the wise will instruct the many.<a name=321:30></a> I apprehend the church, and the divine glory of the Person of Jesus, will be understood by none till they see Him -- certainly not the church -- and then only from without.<a name=321:31></a>

		MY DEAR SISTER, -- I was right in reading the postscript of your sister's letter, for, as I supposed, it shews much more of the state of her mind than all the rest.<a name=329:1></a> She has her mind bent on a place of ministry; and I do feel that, blest as she has been, she is on the brink of a precipice, though, as yet, she may not have fallen into it.<a name=329:2></a> I do not question that women had gifts.<a name=329:3></a> It is evident; the scripture is quite plain.<a name=329:4></a> So that all the passages brought to prove this, prove only what is fully admitted, before the real question is touched.<a name=329:5></a> Further, that women laboured in the Lord, that is also true, as I doubt not many have most sweetly, even in these days; and for my own part I should most entirely rejoice in it.<a name=329:6></a> But that is not the question.<a name=329:7></a> The question is about the assemblies of God: and these the word of God is as plain as possibly can be, to forbid it positively.<a name=329:8></a> In 1 Corinthians 11 after giving directions for the modesty of the manner of a woman's praying or prophesying, he goes on to speak of their coming together in verse 17: the previous part having nothing to do with an assembly, the directions for which commence with verse 17.<a name=329:9></a> He continues on through chapter 14.<a name=329:10></a> the question of assemblies, having treated of gifts in themselves, and compared with charity (chapter 13) as necessary to the subject, and resumes fully in verse 23 the assembly; and having spoken of "all assemblies of the saints" -- God being the author of peace in them -- He says positively, "Let your women keep silence in the assemblies, for it is not permitted unto them to speak.<a name=329:11></a>" In 1 Timothy 2 the apostle says, "I will therefore that men pray everywhere .<a name=329:12></a>.<a name=329:13></a>.<a name=329:14></a> .<a name=329:15></a> In like manner also that women adorn themselves .<a name=329:16></a>.<a name=329:17></a>.<a name=329:18></a> .<a name=329:19></a> Let the women learn in silence with all subjection: but I suffer not a woman to teach .<a name=329:20></a>.<a name=329:21></a>.<a name=329:22></a> but to be in silence.<a name=329:23></a>" Now if the gifts were denied to have been given to women, passages may be produced which plainly shew they had them, and overthrow such denial; but there is nothing whatever to modify these rules.<a name=329:24></a> Only two or three prophets were to speak in the assembly; there might be twenty that had gifts in it, but the order of the assembly was such for men: for women it was to hold their tongues.<a name=329:25></a> The possession of a gift by a man did not warrant their breaking the rule laid down by the apostle, whose directions were of authority; nor did the possession of a gift by a woman warrant her breaking the rule as to woman.<a name=329:26></a> There being neither male nor female in Christ Jesus has nothing to do with gifts in assemblies, but their unity in life and privileges in Christ.<a name=329:27></a> No question of expediency can warrant departure from scripture regulations, and departure from them will soon end in sorrow and confusion.<a name=329:28></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		My advice to your sister is, that it is she herself that is setting aside one passage by another: because I admit all her passages recognise the gifts in women and their labour.<a name=329:29></a> But as man's exercise of gift was regulated (the spirit of the prophets being subject to the prophets), so also was woman's, and differently: they were not to speak at all in the assemblies, nor to teach.<a name=329:30></a> You should urge upon your sister these passages, and that she is going positively contrary to the word of God; and I say to you, I do really think she is in a very dangerous path.<a name=329:31></a>

		There is nothing said of raising saints from the dead under the seventh trumpet, though I do not object to the conclusion that as it is the winding up of God's appeals to the world and the introduction of the world-kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, so it announces the judicial recompense in broad terms up to the end.<a name=336:9></a> The time of award to His "servants the prophets, and to the saints," etc.<a name=336:10></a>, does not fix it as the moment of their resurrection -- they may well have been raised before.<a name=336:11></a> At any rate, nothing of the kind can be built on a passage which is silent as to that for which it is alleged.<a name=336:12></a>

		Nor is there the least warrant to connect "the seventh trumpet" with "the last trump" of 1 Corinthians 15, nor even with the "great sound of a trumpet" in Matthew 24.<a name=336:13></a> "The seventh" is of course the closing one of the Apocalyptic series and of the general course of the book up to the kingdom.<a name=336:14></a> "The last trump" of 1 Corinthians 15 means Simply the final summons when the heavenly saints leave their earthly sojourn to join the Lord -- a figure, like others in the chapter, taken from familiar military matters.<a name=336:15></a> The trumpet in the gospel all rather connected with the divine call to gather Israel from all lands according to the prophets.<a name=336:16></a> There is no doubt that when this point is reached all the departments of the kingdom, heavenly and earthly, will be occupied and displayed by Christ, the risen saints, and the people of God, nor will it cease till every creature, even of the lost, bows and confesses that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.<a name=336:17></a> Daniel and Job will be there, of course, among the rest.<a name=336:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This depended on individual spirituality and divine teaching; only we must remember it could not be said, "Ye have an unction from the Holy One and ye know all things.<a name=347:7></a>" They had not the Holy Ghost, the Spirit of truth, to guide into all truth.<a name=347:8></a> This makes all the difference as to intelligence.<a name=347:9></a> Further, it was not the intention of God, while the veil was unrent, to put the consciences of saints in the position in which the rending of it was to set them -- so that "the worshippers once purged should have no more conscience of sins.<a name=347:10></a>" Alas!<a name=347:11></a> many Christians are in a Jewish state in this respect.<a name=347:12></a> Had this been the case, the free admission of the Gentiles by faith on the same footing would have been the consequence, as this was not intended.<a name=347:13></a> On the other hand, there was the thought, that the time was coming when the nation's sins and iniquities would be remembered no more, and this faith could look forward to, as to the then rejoicing of the Gentiles with His people, and a heavenly portion for the departed saints.<a name=347:14></a> This leads back to the original promise of the seed of the woman bruising the serpent's head; and it, again, held out to faith a full restoration of man from the ruin, which though vague might have been complete in expectation.<a name=347:15></a> The clothing with skins, and Abel's sacrifice, and Noah's, point to covering and acceptance through a sacrifice; Isaac's, to the faith of resurrection.<a name=347:16></a> But when sacrifices were legally instituted and the law given, hopes of forgiveness and restoration in peace in a coming age, but no purged conscience, save occasional at the present time, marked the condition of the worshipper.<a name=347:17></a> Before that time it was a larger expectation of restoration and goodness, and founded on sacrifices and covering iniquity and nakedness before God; but, though larger and more complete, more vague, of course, by the seed of the woman, resurrection and heavenly things coming in.<a name=347:18></a> For this both Enoch and Abraham, and even Job, furnished evidence.<a name=347:19></a> Under the prescription of the law the conscience was more brought under the yoke, present occasional forgiveness by a sin-offering more definite, but it was narrowed into present occasional clearing, and the hope of deliverance put into the age to come and connected with Messiah, as we know also it will be.<a name=347:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With all this was connected a feebler estimate of sin and of the need consequently of divine righteousness, though this was prophetically intimated, but also in the age to come.<a name=347:21></a> There was sense of sin, of being shapen in iniquity (but no intelligence of a conflict between flesh and Spirit) and thus as a present thing righteousness looked for in the Lord; but, before the law, divine favour and the averting a curse by sacrifice; under the law, a definite sin-offering meeting the actual sins of the individual or of all, and a general sense of maintenance of heart in divine favour by the day of atonement -- the state as I have said in which most Christians are.<a name=347:22></a>

		Chapter 2.<a name=360:16></a> The apostle condemns the philosophers, who moralised and were not better than the mass, and who were thus treasuring up wrath for the day of wrath.<a name=360:17></a> For God demanded realities.<a name=360:18></a> The form of the law would be of no avail.<a name=360:19></a> All shall be judged according to their works, whether Jew or Gentile; and the Gentile who, pressed by his natural conscience, fulfilled what the law required, would be in a better case than the Jew who possessed that law and who broke it.<a name=360:20></a> As many as had sinned without law should perish without law, and those who had sinned under law should be judged by law, in the day when God should judge the secrets of the hearts of men (not the conduct of the nation by earthly judgments) according to the gospel committed to the apostle.<a name=360:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Such is the general exposition of the ways of God in judgment upon every soul of man, judgment founded on the testimony of the creation, the knowledge which man (in Noah) had got of God, the testimony of the natural conscience, the positive testimony of the law, adding that one despised the goodness of God which was leading man to repentance.<a name=360:22></a> But the Jews, who pretended to special privileges, needed a few words beyond this.<a name=360:23></a> The apostle, by the law itself, brings them out guilty.<a name=360:24></a> The Jew, towards the Gentile, boasted in the law, in the light he had, in the divine teaching he had, and afterwards he did the very contrary of that which that light and that law required from him.<a name=360:25></a> Again, I say, God demands that which is real and true, and the Gentile, who, having no law, did what the law required, should be in a better place than the Jew, who had the law and broke it.<a name=360:26></a> Had not the Jew then any superiority above the Gentile?<a name=360:27></a> He had, without any doubt, and every way.<a name=360:28></a> Specially he possessed the oracles of God.<a name=360:29></a> Now, says the apostle, let us see what they say.<a name=360:30></a> The Jew was saying, They are for us alone; the Gentiles have nothing to do with them.<a name=360:31></a> I agree to it, says the apostle.<a name=360:32></a> Whatever the things the law says, it speaks to them who are under the law.<a name=360:33></a> It will shew you therefore what you are.<a name=360:34></a> Here you are: not one righteous, not one who seeks after God, not one who understands.<a name=360:35></a> According to your assertions, that is what it says of yourselves.<a name=360:36></a> The Gentiles have nothing to do with it: outside all righteousness and slaves of sin, it is no question of them here.<a name=360:37></a> Such then is the picture that God gives of your condition, and every mouth is stopped, and all the world become under judgment to God.<a name=360:38></a>

		I come now to what led me to send you these lines -- the remedy which God Himself has prepared, and which He presents to us, for the condition of wretchedness into which sin has plunged us.<a name=360:39></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		From chapter 3: 21 to the end of chapter 5: 11, the apostle takes up the question of sins; and from verse 12 of this last chapter to the end of chapter 8, the question of sin.<a name=360:40></a> In both cases he shews the blessing which is the result of God's intervention in grace.<a name=360:41></a> At the end of chapter 3 the blood of Jesus is presented to us as the means of our justification.<a name=360:42></a> God Himself has presented Jesus to us, as a mercy-seat, through faith in His blood.<a name=360:43></a> The righteousness of God in the passing by the sins of the Old Testament believers is manifested, righteousness which becomes the foundation of our hopes in the present time, that is to say, since the accomplishment of the work of Christ.<a name=360:44></a> In chapter 4, he speaks of the effect of the resurrection of Christ on this question.<a name=360:45></a> He has been delivered for our offences, and has been raised for our justification.<a name=360:46></a> The efficacy of the death of Christ has been clearly shown by the resurrection, as well as the power of a new life for us -- the life of Jesus risen -- which has its place, when all our sins have been atoned for by Christ.<a name=360:47></a> But all this refers to sins -- to what has been committed: He has been delivered for our offences, and has been raised for our justification.<a name=360:48></a> The first eleven verses of chapter 5 shew us the blessings which flow from this, peace and grace now, glory in hope, and the knowledge of the love of God by the Holy Ghost which is given to us; so that we also boast in tribulations, being made capable, through that love, to interpret them; then we make our boast in God Himself.<a name=360:49></a> This chapter goes even farther than the eighth in this, that the fifth presents to us more God Himself in His sovereign grace, and our joy in Himself; whereas the eighth chapter shews more our position before Him and what He is for us.<a name=360:50></a> Nevertheless, in the latter, there is deeper experience.<a name=360:51></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		At chapter 5: 12 begins the teaching of the apostle with respect to sin.<a name=360:52></a> The difference is evident.<a name=360:53></a> If it be a question of sins, you, my reader, you have yours, and I, I have mine.<a name=360:54></a> If it be a question of our nature, of our flesh, we are but one, one sole nature, one sole mass.<a name=360:55></a> Hence the apostle turns to the heads or sources of our nature, whether as to good or as to evil: Adam and Christ.<a name=360:56></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, to the end of chapter 8, it is a question of sin, and not of sins.<a name=360:57></a> Sin shall have no dominion over you -- sin taking occasion by the law.<a name=360:58></a> Here Christ died to sin, not for our sins.<a name=360:59></a> I learn, not what I have done, but what I am.<a name=360:60></a> I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, good does not dwell.<a name=360:61></a> Thus the experience is deeper; often, also, gone through after having understood the forgiveness of our sins, and, consequently, casting the soul into perplexity and uncertainty.<a name=360:62></a> But peace, also, is much deeper when once it is founded on the truth which is taught here; but it is learnt in an experimental way.<a name=360:63></a> My faith here does not rest upon the fact that Christ died for my sins, but on the truth that, He being dead, I am dead with Him.<a name=360:64></a> Hence, mark it well, there is no question of forgiveness here.<a name=360:65></a> I forgive my child his faults; I do not forgive the evil disposition which produced them -- I try to correct it.<a name=360:66></a> The correction of sin in the flesh is death.<a name=360:67></a> Now, we are dead in Christ.<a name=360:68></a> The apostle begins this teaching, by shewing that, by the obedience of Christ alone, those who are linked with Him in the sight of God, are constituted righteous; that, as Adam's disobedience placed in the position of sinners before God all those who were connected with Adam by descent, so the obedience of Christ placed all those who would be found connected with Him by grace in the position of righteous persons, and this in contrast with the law that killed each guilty sinner for his own faults.<a name=360:69></a> No doubt we, each one of us, have committed our own sins, completing the evil each one to his own account.<a name=360:70></a> But it is none the less true, that, if by the disobedience of Adam we are constituted sinners, the obedience of Christ has constituted us righteous -- us, I say, who believe in Jesus.<a name=360:71></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The objection made to the doctrine of justification by the obedience of Christ first presents itself to the apostle: the value of the work of Christ does not stop in Him who accomplished it, but it extends to others; it matters little, therefore, if they continue to live in sin.<a name=360:72></a> Here is the answer: How live, if we have <i>died</i>?<a name=360:73></a> It is a very simple thing.<a name=360:74></a> We are baptised unto His death, identified with Him in the likeness of His death.<a name=360:75></a> Our portion -- in that He died to sin once for all, and that He lives to (or, for) God -- is to reckon ourselves dead, and alive to (or, for) God in Christ Jesus.<a name=360:76></a> We thus obey, according to the new life of which we are made partakers.<a name=360:77></a> This same truth as to death applies (chapter 7) to the law, for it rules over a man as long as he lives.<a name=360:78></a> But we have died; nature, the old man to which the law applied, no longer exists.<a name=360:79></a> We were in the flesh: we are not in it (that is, not in Adam), but in Christ.<a name=360:80></a> The end of chapter 7 is the experience gone through, of the effects of the law on the soul of a renewed man still under law; known now as being spiritual.<a name=360:81></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In these experiences the soul learns, by the teaching of God, that sin is not the true I (which, in effect, detests sin), but is the sin that dwells in me; then, that sin has dominion over the I, although the latter wills that which is good.<a name=360:82></a> The soul learns that in it (in the old I, that is to say, in the flesh) good does not dwell.<a name=360:83></a> Such is the lesson which is so needful, but so humbling.<a name=360:84></a> One has come to the end of what man is viewed as he is, a child of Adam, enmity against God; but he who, though not willing it, had been a slave, is delivered through redemption.<a name=360:85></a> He is in Christ dead to sin, and alive to God by Him.<a name=360:86></a> He gives thanks to God; he is not in the flesh at all.<a name=360:87></a> It is not, as we have said, Christ dead viewed as bearing our sins in His body on the tree, that the believer owns as his Deliverer, however precious and needful this truth may be; but Christ dead to sin, and the believer dead with Him.<a name=360:88></a> Our resurrection with Him is less in evidence here; but we must reckon ourselves dead, and alive to (or, for) God by Him.<a name=360:89></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus this second part of the teaching of the epistle shews us as dead, as to the old man, as regards the flesh, for faith (that is, as to our position as children of Adam), and alive to (or, for) God by Christ.<a name=360:90></a> The effect of the desires of the new man, when we are under law, is to render us unhappy; but we learn, through this moral discipline, to have done with the flesh for faith, by distinguishing between self and the flesh, and having learnt that the flesh is too strong for me.<a name=360:91></a> But then redemption comes in; and we are in Christ risen, and not in the flesh; we belong to the second husband, Christ risen, and not to the first.<a name=360:92></a> But we learn that the flesh has been -- not forgiven, but -- condemned.<a name=360:93></a> When?<a name=360:94></a> When Christ was made (a sacrifice) for sin.<a name=360:95></a> The flesh is dead and condemned already, when I belong to Him who is risen; but I am not in the flesh, I am in Christ.<a name=360:96></a> In this second part of the doctrine, we find therefore our place in Christ, before God; as we saw in the first, that God has blotted out our sins, as responsible beings in the flesh, by the death of Christ.<a name=360:97></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not develop the happy consequences which the apostle draws from this in chapter 8.<a name=360:98></a> We are children; the Holy Ghost dwells in us, shews us our inheritance, helps us in our weaknesses; while everything is secure, seeing that God is for us, as He who gives and He who justifies, and that His love in Christ (who has, in grace, gone through all our sorrows, and is now at the right hand of God) keeps us when we realise the experience of it.<a name=360:99></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapters 9, 10, 11 conciliate there being no difference between Jew and Gentile, with the special privileges of the Jews; they form a supplement, added to the main doctrine of the epistle.<a name=360:100></a> But I have attained my object, if I have presented clearly to the Christian the difference of the work of Christ for our sins (chapter 3: 21 to 5: 11), and of Christ dead to sin, and ourselves dead with Him, so that, for faith, we have done with sin (chapter 5: 12 to the end of chapter viii.<a name=360:101></a>), sin having been condemned when Christ died on the cross, and ourselves as having part in His death, dead with Him to that which was condemned, belonging also to the second husband -- Christ risen.<a name=360:102></a> We have peace through forgiveness; deliverance, by the Spirit of life, in that we are in Him, and alive by Him, in consequence of accomplished redemption.<a name=360:103></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ died for sins; Christ dead to sin, and we in Him, in consequence of redemption: such is the doctrine of the Epistle to the Romans, which distinguishes clearly its two parts.<a name=360:104></a>

		[Mr Biava] [From the French.<a name=365:1></a>] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I received your note in due time, but waited to read your paper before replying; and I was going about to meetings from morning till night, sometimes because brethren from the neighbourhood were brought together, sometimes (in Ireland) because there was a remarkable movement there.<a name=365:2></a> I have been overwhelmed with work; still, I have read it.<a name=365:3></a> I have but one observation to make.<a name=365:4></a> You give <i>the</i> churches a more formal position than they have in my mind.<a name=365:5></a> I do not speak of error, for I see plainly that you recognise the church as the body of Christ, but only of an impression left on my mind.<a name=365:6></a> I do not recognise that there may be members of a church; I do not know that you said so: it is only an impression.<a name=365:7></a> Perhaps what comes nearest to it is the expression 'the several members with their respective churches.<a name=365:8></a>' This does not say so, it is true; but it would perhaps imply it to those who are accustomed to this thought.<a name=365:9></a> Do not think, dear brother, that I say this because I wish to find fault with the pamphlet; I thought it very good, and I am pointing out the one thing that presents itself to my mind as possibly raising a question.<a name=365:10></a> I hope it will be a summary very useful to your countrymen.<a name=365:11></a> I intended to have written to you when I had read half your paper over again, and had a little more quiet here in Edinburgh .<a name=365:12></a>.<a name=365:13></a>.<a name=365:14></a> .<a name=365:15></a>

		I believe Christ is competent to enter into all the sorrows of the human heart by means of what He went through, sin apart I believe in a special manner He entered into the sorrows of Israel.<a name=375:13></a> The fundamental and mischievous error of my accusers is, assuming (just Newton's error) that entering into the sorrows of any one's position meant being in the state or relationship which brought the sorrow on.<a name=375:14></a> But I think the doctrine of my accusers horrible, and a total denial of the truth of Christ's sufferings.<a name=375:15></a> It is those who have been under the pestilent influence of thinking sorrows or sufferings of heart in Christ implied the state that had brought them on man (an error on which all H.<a name=375:16></a>'s reasonings with me depend), who are troubled and uneasy.<a name=375:17></a> My good friends will have to learn that they can go wrong as well as those they are in such a hurry to condemn.<a name=375:18></a> If they fall into the snare of taking other people's representations of my doctrine, or read my words under the effect of them, they will have to deal with God about it, and see why.<a name=375:19></a>

		As regards my taking up the matter on my return, I did fully take it up, and searched my own publications, scripture, and my accusers' correspondence, as fully as I could.<a name=375:20></a> I replied to every one who wrote to me honestly to inquire.<a name=375:21></a> If brethren.<a name=375:22></a> think I am going to give up my direct service committed to me (however unworthy I may be) by the Lord, to pander to what I believe to be mere wicked accusations, I can only say I cannot do so.<a name=375:23></a> I am persuaded that more spiritual apprehensions of the sufferings of Christ, and true knowledge of conflict in their own souls, would have made brethren capable of juster decision in the matter.<a name=375:24></a> Not suspecting the kind of attack and accusations, expressions might be found in my papers which gave a handle to them; hence I have taken no high ground, but patiently awaited brethren's minds clearing up.<a name=375:25></a>

		I do not think an upright willing mind could for a moment have interpreted what I have said as has been done.<a name=375:26></a> It amounts to the allegation that Christ was a condemned sinner, a saint through grace, and learning when a sinner.<a name=375:27></a> I do not believe my adversaries think I hold this, however my expressions may afford a handle to what they say; and I must take them (my accusers) as I find them, seeking to feel as God would have me feel, but I do think that their views ought to have awakened brethren's minds to a sense of the false grounds on which their accusations rest.<a name=375:28></a> What they deny forms an integral part of my Christianity.<a name=375:29></a> I should as much think of giving that up, as of accepting their views.<a name=375:30></a> But I have not neglected the subject since I left England .<a name=375:31></a>.<a name=375:32></a>.<a name=375:33></a> .<a name=375:34></a> But see what I have to deal with, or rather what troubles the minds you speak of.<a name=375:35></a> It is alleged that I say Christ entered into the experiences of souls, etc.<a name=375:36></a>, which I cannot find -- this means in their minds that He had these experiences, and He is then considered as Himself involved in them from God.<a name=375:37></a> And it is next added, it must be from the relationship He was in; not one word of which I have ever said or thought, and it flows from the abominable false principle that Christ suffered only from atonement or sympathy; that is, that besides atonement He never really suffered at all, and if there were any other, He must have been in the relationship that caused it.<a name=375:38></a> I must again express my astonishment that such doctrine, which is avowedly Mr.<a name=375:39></a> H.<a name=375:40></a>'s, has not opened people's eyes.<a name=375:41></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The only real ambiguity I know in what I have written is the word suffering, because suffering may have the sense of outwardly inflicted pain, and inward sense of any evil; and when I say Christ passed through these sufferings, it may be taken as inflicted on Him (and as to circumstances, outwardly in the main He did go through them), or as inwardly entering into the pain and grief of it, in whatever way brought to His soul, As to His being in the relationship and meriting it (or, as Mr.<a name=375:42></a> H.<a name=375:43></a> wrote to me, God smote the wrong person), I can only look at as an evil denial of all Christ's true sufferings except atonement.<a name=375:44></a> But the ambiguous sense of the word suffering gave probably a handle to those who sought it.<a name=375:45></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the alleged entering into the experiences, allow me to ask: Do you think Christ can enter into the sorrows of a broken and contrite heart, fearful, and pressed within?<a name=375:50></a> If so further, do you think what He went through on earth enables Him to do it in a special way?<a name=375:51></a> Yet it has nothing to do with His being contrite -- though I by no means think this is the highest way of looking at it.<a name=375:52></a> The true aspect of it all is objective, the "man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.<a name=375:53></a>" I believe I have no more to add as to the papers called in question.<a name=375:54></a>

		Those who have written against me were fully aware that I denied holding what they allege to be my views long before their pamphlets came out.<a name=375:56></a> There is another source of their error.<a name=375:57></a> Having assumed that smiting is infliction of atoning wrath from God, or, at any rate infliction from the state or position Christ was in, they have concluded I involved Him in this position.<a name=375:58></a> Now Messiah was cut off, the necessary consequence of Israel's state.<a name=375:59></a> In this He did go to accomplishing the work of atonement, or wrath against sin, which He bore from God; but in scripture it is not used for the atoning part of the work.<a name=375:60></a> In God's wisdom that in which Messiah was cut off was made to be the accomplishment of atonement for Israel and for us.<a name=375:61></a> It is this the Jews discover in Isaiah 53.<a name=375:62></a> The mingling both would not stumble me, but it makes the Psalms unintelligible and has led those who deny scriptural language as to it, to deny all Christ's sufferings, except atonement.<a name=375:63></a>

		MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I cannot but regret that this thought has laid hold of your mind.<a name=386:1></a> It goes far more deeply into the centre of Christianity than mere human notions of measured punishment.<a name=386:2></a> The immortality of the soul lies at the root, and with it, responsibility, repentance, and atonement; all of which are wholly gone in this human scheme.<a name=386:3></a> The character and evil of sin, and divine judgment, are equally involved; and wherever it acquires power over the mind, the whole state of the soul is changed and loses reality and integrity before God.<a name=386:4></a> It is not merely a question of comparatively obscure passages in the Revelation, but of our nature, and the whole nature of our relations with God.<a name=386:5></a> If the soul be immortal its state in judgment continues; if not, we are only a superior kind of animal, more intelligent perhaps, but morally the same, and our responsibility, as such, gone.<a name=386:6></a> If temporary punishment is adequate, Christ had to bear no more.<a name=386:7></a> I say this not to prove anything, though for one who possesses the truth in his conscience it proves a great deal; but to shew you what is involved.<a name=386:8></a> If a man was to prove to me that a doctrine involved unholiness, I should know without more it was false; as was said to me yesterday I am free to sin -- that must be false interpretation.<a name=386:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I will first shew you how false your presentation of things is, as to "all live unto him.<a name=386:10></a>" There is no implication.<a name=386:11></a> The doctrine to which it is an answer denies the immortality of the soul and holds consequently that as the soul is not immortal, death is ceasing to exist, as in the case of the beasts that perish.<a name=386:12></a> Now the passage quoted is a direct formal proof that death is no such thing, but that when dead, they are alive to God as before.<a name=386:13></a> It formally and explicitly denies their doctrine.<a name=386:14></a> But you say, "These shall go away into everlasting punishment," implies everlasting punishment.<a name=386:15></a> It implies nothing about it, it states it; just as it states that the others go away into "everlasting life.<a name=386:16></a>" Neither imply anything, they state the fact.<a name=386:17></a> If it had been said "everlasting fire," it might have been alleged truly or falsely, that though the fire was eternal, they were not.<a name=386:18></a> But they go into "everlasting punishment," which is not so, if they do not exist.<a name=386:19></a> There is no punishment if no one is there.<a name=386:20></a> Again, you say "the smoke of their torment" modifies.<a name=386:21></a> How does it modify it, if it is their torment, not the smoke of the fire?<a name=386:22></a> It is the smoke of what they are undergoing.<a name=386:23></a> If death is not ceasing to exist (and scripture is carefully certain as to this, killing the body is not killing the soul); if the duration of punishment is the same as of life, as of God, as of redemption, the case is clear statement, not implying.<a name=386:24></a> The truth of the ground taken by those who hold these doctrines is that we have existence as animals; all their arguments turn on this.<a name=386:25></a> If this be so, responsibility is gone.<a name=386:26></a> A dog and an elephant are not responsible, have not to repent, Christ has not to bear their sins.<a name=386:27></a> Give them eternal life!<a name=386:28></a> no gospel is needed for them.<a name=386:29></a> Christ has nothing to bear for them.<a name=386:30></a> They need no atonement.<a name=386:31></a> They do not hate God as man in the flesh does.<a name=386:32></a> If, as in your theory, men endure temporary punishment (a cruel system unworthy of God), then Christ had only that to bear for me.<a name=386:33></a> Sin has only that measure of evil.<a name=386:34></a> All the glory of His work, and my sense of sin, sinks down in proportion.<a name=386:35></a> Nor did I ever find one person who held these views, who had not at least mentally lost the atonement, nor can it be otherwise.<a name=386:36></a> For one who has only an animal soul cannot be responsible; be he saved or not, no atonement was needed.<a name=386:37></a> Christianity is gone in this system.<a name=386:38></a> If I have an immortal or undying soul and hate God, when judicially cast out (being such) my torment is infinite, as far as a creature can use the word.<a name=386:39></a> This I understand -- feel in a measure -- only not with finality of course present -- but if it is only inflicted punishment for a term, without any object, but purely gratuitous, it seems an easy scheme to man, but it is God taking pleasure in useless punishment when they are going to end their existence after all.<a name=386:40></a> What "eternal" means is clear from scripture: "The things that are seen are temporal, the things that are unseen are eternal.<a name=386:41></a>" It means what is the opposite to "for a time.<a name=386:42></a>"

		[W Kelly] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I have got frightened on seeing the title page of what you are publishing of my old papers: I thought nothing -- as all but two had been published, and they gave some historical insight into the first starting-point of brethren -- of their being published again; nor do I.<a name=389:1></a> It is the title page only that frightens me.<a name=389:2></a> It has a kind of pretentious look, making a kind of author of me who attaches himself to his works and his works to himself, which is not really the case.<a name=389:3></a> I feel as little as it is possible to feel I believe of authorship, save in the first place that what God does not give is useless in the church, or worse; and, not having naturally that kind of pride, sometimes I do not like what I have written, sometimes I do.<a name=389:4></a>

		Do you know, I am somewhat afraid that this publication has brought out Hall and Dorman, worked on them, I mean, to take the place they have.<a name=389:5></a> They will have felt that it was committing them to a kind of system of leadership, not by anything I am doing now, for, as you know, I have not been, so to say, in England; but as a programme of doctrine which was put forth.<a name=389:6></a> I have never had the most distant idea of any unsoundness of doctrine in what they took up, nor have not; nor have any peculiar views at all on Christ's personal or relative position.<a name=389:7></a> So that while, of course, willing to correct or improve expressions, I believe there is edification, not error, in the papers.<a name=389:8></a> I should be sorry that deeper apprehensions as to Christ's sufferings should stumble any, for that is all there is.<a name=389:9></a> I know not that charity could have done more to remove it; or that it would have been right to deprive the saints of blessing (which has been some five years before them) as if it was error; but I leave all that to God.<a name=389:10></a>

		It is the title page of the book I speak of as having a somewhat pretentious air on my part, though I had nothing to say to it.<a name=389:11></a> I do not know if it could be remedied now, and another title given -- "a collection of tracts and papers, some out of print or never published, by J.<a name=389:12></a> N.<a name=389:13></a> D.<a name=389:14></a>," or some such thing.<a name=389:15></a> I have not the least objection to their seeing the light, though the form frightened me.<a name=389:16></a> I never liked putting "the author" in any tract of mine, feeling there was no good in anything God was not the author of.<a name=389:17></a>

		[W Kelly] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I am on my way by Montreal to New York, where they look for me.<a name=392:4></a> I found your B.<a name=392:5></a> T.<a name=392:6></a> and pamphlet here.<a name=392:7></a> I have nothing to reply.<a name=392:8></a> I suppose the paper was one in my MS.<a name=392:9></a> books, and so not guarded against expected adversaries; but I have had the question before me often.<a name=392:10></a> The opposition is only ill-will, and were I to seek to cavil, I might reply that Christ shed no blood in dying at all.<a name=392:11></a> It was not by taking blood from Him as a victim that He died.<a name=392:12></a> The water and blood that were shed were when He was dead -- and it is vital to hold that He gave up His life and that it was not taken from Him by shedding His blood.<a name=392:13></a> I quite admit He had really to die.<a name=392:14></a> But the reality of His drinking the cup of wrath, which unquestionably from scripture was accomplished before He gave up His spirit, is of the last importance.<a name=392:15></a> I do not believe there is in the objection any love of the truth, any real, serious concern about Christ, any deep sense of need met by the blessed Lord's sacrifice, anything but ill-will, and I have no answer to give, and am quite unmoved at such an one's accounting it heresy.<a name=392:16></a>

		-- - As regards the first query<a href="#393:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> the intelligence of the passage supposes a clear apprehension of the Christian's individual position before God, and is the expression of that position in, if I may so speak, its dissected characters.<a name=393:1></a> It does not speak simply of full and perfect forgiveness of sins through the blood of Christ and of a righteousness of God manifested therein (that is found in the end of chapter 3); but unfolds the elements of the position of the believer before God as reckoning himself dead to sin, baptised to Christ's death and alive to God through Jesus Christ our Lord, as having discovered not that we had, sinned, and come short of the glory of God (that again is found in chapter 3), but that in him, that is in his flesh, dwelleth no good thing.<a name=393:2></a> He has learned not what he has done merely, but what he is.<a name=393:3></a> Hence the simple fulness of grace is more largely stated in chapter 5, which closes that first part at verse 11 -- God's love to the sinner, so that we joy in Him, knowing His love.<a name=393:4></a> It is God towards the sinner and so known.<a name=393:5></a> Chapter 8 is the believer before God, his privileges fuller, but grace and divine love in itself not so absolutely stated.<a name=393:6></a> One is God Himself to the sinner, the other the believer's standing with God In chapters 3-5.<a name=393:7></a> Christ has died for our sins when we were sinners: now is added, we have been baptised to His death and are to reckon ourselves dead; the bearing of which, moreover, on the law and our experience under it is reasoned out by the Spirit in chapter 7.<a name=393:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having prefaced this, which will make the answers more intelligible, or at least lay the ground for them if apprehended, I reply, Old Testament saints could not be described as not in the flesh, but in the Spirit.<a name=393:9></a> The Spirit is the seal of our new position in Christ, promised in the prophets and by the Lord, and received by Him for us after His ascension (Acts 2: 33), and given as the Spirit of adoption, and uniting us to Him ascended.<a name=393:10></a> The distinction of flesh and Spirit is founded on the descent of the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost, and the possession of the Spirit promised by Christ, and the present fruit of His redemption work.<a name=393:11></a> In His time on earth John could say, "The Holy Ghost was not yet, because that Jesus was not yet glorified.<a name=393:12></a>" And lust was in the Old Testament saints, but now the flesh working lusts against the Spirit, and freedom by the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death is known only to those who have the Spirit, given consequent on an accomplished redemption.<a name=393:13></a> It is clear they could not be in the Spirit if the Spirit was not given, and scripture is as clear on this as words can make it.<a name=393:14></a> The gift of the Spirit was such and so dependent on Christ's going away, that it was expedient for them He should do so.<a name=393:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have said above 'if apprehended,' because it cannot be but by experience.<a name=393:16></a> Forgiveness I can understand in a certain way if I have it not, for men are forgiven their faults by parents, etc.<a name=393:17></a>, and the burden of debt being removed is also intelligible.<a name=393:18></a> But being dead and reckoning myself dead when I feel myself alive is not so easy even to understand, till divine grace, teaching me to submit to God's righteousness, has set me free in the consciousness of a new position in which, alive in Christ, I treat the flesh as dead.<a name=393:19></a> It is called "the Spirit of Christ," because it is that which forms us in living likeness to Him: it is Christ in us in the power of life.<a name=393:20></a> This was perfectly displayed in His life in itself: in us it is realised in the measure in which we walk in the Spirit, as we live in the Spirit.<a name=393:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Some further remarks will clear this point.<a name=393:22></a> The inquirer may remark, that it is called "the Spirit of God," "the Spirit of Christ," and "the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus.<a name=393:23></a>" I need not say that it is the same Spirit.<a name=393:24></a> But in the first, it is in contrast with the flesh.<a name=393:25></a> (See Galatians 5: 17) In the second, it is that form of life in which its own qualities are displayed as in Christ Himself.<a name=393:26></a> In the third, it is the pledge of final deliverance and glorifying of the body itself into the likeness of Christ glorified -- here spoken of however not farther than the quickening of the body by reason of it; but it goes on to the quickening of the mortal body itself.<a name=393:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards oujk e[stin aujtou' (verse 9), all here is spoken of the Christian as such, subjectively perfect as to his christian state: he who has not Christ's Spirit is not His.<a name=393:28></a> It is not a question of what he may be afterwards, or whether he is a sheep, or, so to speak, aujtw'; but even if God be working in him to lead him to Christ, he is not yet His in fact until he has His Spirit.<a name=393:29></a> Redemption and assurance of faith have been so set aside in evangelical teaching (though not at the Reformation -- assurance was insisted on then as alone justifying faith) that many persons who have the Spirit of Christ, which is that of liberty and adoption, are afraid to be free and to say they are children, and yet they have the Spirit of adoption.<a name=393:30></a> Such are surely His; but none can be said to be His ( aujtou' ) till they have His Spirit.<a name=393:31></a> All men are Christ's in a certain sense; all His sheep are His own in another: but none can be said to be His when they have not His Spirit.<a name=393:32></a>

		The sa;rx is not dead; sa;rx would not do at all here (verse 10); when the sw'ma is alive, active in will, it is sa;rx, and there is sin.<a name=393:33></a> Hence if "Christ be in you" -- not simply, if I am born of God (which a man is in Rom 7), but, if Christ be in me I reckon myself dead; I am, in the true Christian estimate, dead (compare Colossians 3) -- "the body is dead" because its only produce, if alive, is sin.<a name=393:34></a> It is for the Christian a mere lifeless instrument of the new man, of the Spirit that dwells in me.<a name=393:35></a> It is to be remarked here, that in this part of the chapter the Spirit is looked at as the source of life, though as dwelling in us: it is the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus.<a name=393:36></a> Afterwards, it is looked at personally as acting in us; hence it is said, the "Spirit is life.<a name=393:37></a>" I own and recognise only the Spirit that dwells in me as the source and spring of life in me, because righteousness is what I seek, and its fruit in contrast with flesh, a contrast fully made previously.<a name=393:38></a> Pneu'ma is surely the Spirit of God, but dwelling in us, and the source of and characterising life.<a name=393:39></a> The Old Testament saints could not be said to be of Christ thus, as is apparent from what has been said.<a name=393:40></a> The saint really under law, in the Romans vii.<a name=393:41></a> state, could not either be said to be aujtou'.<a name=393:42></a> But we must remember, that many are practically under law by false teachers keeping them there, who are not really, but in secret look to God as their Father.<a name=393:43></a><br>[1867.<a name=393:44></a>]

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This transition is, if possible, still more clearly marked in Luke at the end of chapter 13.<a name=400:12></a> The rupture between Jehovah and Jerusalem is complete: the house which belonged to the children of Jerusalem, once the "house of God," is abandoned, and they will not see the Lord until Psalm 118 is accomplished in their repentance.<a name=400:13></a> Then in chapter 14, the change in the ways of God is clearly shewn, and the sphere of the activity of His grace is no longer the now rejected Israel, but the whole world, after having gathered in the poor of the flock of His people.<a name=400:14></a> (Vers.<a name=400:15></a> 16-24) Then the ways of God in sovereign grace towards man -- towards sinners -- are brought out in that treasury of grace and love, which is found in chapter 15; and in chapter 16, the Lord shews the use that man ought to make of that which he possesses according to nature, being now that which had been particularly proved in Israel -- a steward who was dismissed.<a name=400:16></a> He should make use of it in grace, in view of the future; instead of enjoying it as a thing possessed in this world.<a name=400:17></a> He should think of eternal habitations.<a name=400:18></a> It is here that the passage relative to the kingdom and to John the Baptist is found.<a name=400:19></a> His mission was the pivot of the change.<a name=400:20></a> <i>In this point of view</i> the mission of Christ on the earth -- His ministry -- was but the complement of that of John the Baptist.<a name=400:21></a> Compare Matthew 4: 17; 3: 2.<a name=400:22></a> Only the latter sung the doleful dirge of judgment, and the former the joyful song of hope and of grace, just as our chapter explains it to us.<a name=400:23></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Two great systems of God with respect to the earth are found included in His counsels, and revealed in the word.<a name=400:25></a> One depended on the faithfulness of man to the responsibility which weighed upon him, the other on the active power of God.<a name=400:26></a> These are the dispensations of the law and of the kingdom.<a name=400:27></a> But there was a moment of transition, when the kingdom was preached, and preached in the midst of Israel by John the Baptist and by Christ, without its having been established in power.<a name=400:28></a> The people were put to a moral test as to their use of the right of entering in.<a name=400:29></a> For the rest, the Prophets and the Psalms had indeed announced beforehand the character of those who were to have a part in the blessings of the kingdom.<a name=400:30></a> See Psalms 15, 24, 37, and many others; Isaiah 48: 22; 51, 57: 21; 56: 2, and a multitude of other passages.<a name=400:31></a> The sermon on the mount has put a seal to this testimony by giving it actuality.<a name=400:32></a> Now the preaching of the kingdom had for its effect to separate the remnant (namely, those who had ears to hear) from the evil and hypocrisy which reigned in the midst of the people, to prepare them for the entrance of the kingdom, if it had been established in power; and in fact, Christ being rejected, that they might become the nucleus of the assembly which, according to the counsels of God, was about to be revealed.<a name=400:33></a> Then the kingdom took the character of sowing and other similar forms, and not that of the kingdom of a king in power, and it continued to be preached as about to come; although the salvation and the glory of the church were to occupy, from the coming down of the Holy Spirit, the principal place in the doctrine of which the Spirit is the source.<a name=400:34></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was therefore at the moment when the relationships of Israel with God by means of the Messiah had become impossible and when the relationships founded on the law, and maintained by the testimony of the prophets, were drawing to an end, through the publication of the kingdom ready to be established and, in a certain sense, present in the person of the King -- it was at that moment that the Lord pronounced these words.<a name=400:35></a> Now the first thing that they state is, that "the law and the prophets were until John.<a name=400:36></a>" Israel was placed by God on that footing until John's ministry.<a name=400:37></a> They had but to observe the law, and to rejoice in the hope given by the prophets, and all was well.<a name=400:38></a> This was no longer the case after John.<a name=400:39></a> The kingdom was not established; if it had been, the power of God would have settled everything.<a name=400:40></a> Order and peace would have reigned; the remnant would have been blessed in the kingdom where the King would have reigned in righteousness.<a name=400:41></a> But it was not so; it was preached, and preached by prophets -- and by those who were more than prophets -- and by prophets who were reviled and rejected, and for whom the wilderness and death were an abode or a reward.<a name=400:42></a> The hypocritical nation, a generation of vipers, would have nothing of it.<a name=400:43></a> It was only the energy of faith, going through sufferings, which could seize on it.<a name=400:44></a> Satan and the heads of the nation would do all they could to prevent people from entering, and even soil their hands with the blood of the righteous.<a name=400:45></a> Those who preached the kingdom suffered, and those who entered it were to have their portion with them.<a name=400:46></a> The kingdom was not being established in power; the King did not reign; He was preached.<a name=400:47></a> It was only by violence that one forced one's way into it.<a name=400:48></a> It was the violent ones, those who were not stopped by obstacles and opposition, but who opened to themselves a way through all, these alone it was who were securing a place for themselves.<a name=400:49></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is only this difference between Matthew and Luke, that Matthew speaks exclusively of the character of those who seize on the kingdom, and the position of the latter, and does not therefore go beyond the application of these thoughts to the Jewish people.<a name=400:50></a> Luke had formally spoken of the highways and hedges, and had by his expressions opened the door to the Gentiles without formally pointing to them as the "whomsoever," so often quoted by Paul.<a name=400:51></a> "Every one," he says, "forces his way into it.<a name=400:52></a>" Since it was a matter of preaching and of faith, the Gentile who would listen to the preaching and have that faith would enter in, like any other.<a name=400:53></a> Nevertheless, he only opens the door by a principle, according to the doctrine of that gospel from chapter 4.<a name=400:54></a> The parable which follows these verses in Luke goes farther.<a name=400:55></a> It decidedly opens heaven, and completely overturns the Jewish system, which made earthly blessings to be a proof of God's favour.<a name=400:56></a>

In 144 times there seems little difficulty, it is Moses shewing Israel their Jehovah was Elohim, and therefore it is always in the form of reported speech I have classified the 49 [remaining] different passages. First, where persons speak of Elohim as Jehovah, not in reported but in direct speech, as Genesis 28: 21; 32: 9. If they used the word Jehovah, then Elohim was known to them by that name. Secondly, men calling on the name Jehovah, not on Elohim as if at that time they began to know Him as Jehovah, this, however in the form of reported speech, does not present the same difficulty. Thirdly, angels using the name Jehovah directly to men. Fourthly, God Himself using the name directly to Abram and Jacob. Genesis 15: 7; 28: 13.) If "Jehovah" was known before its formal revelation, without knowing its meaning, is this analogous to the other [names]: namely, Shaddai not known till Abraham; Abba not known till HE declared it and sent forth the Spirit into our hearts?

		[F B Wride] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I have no doubt at all, that a person, who never has been baptised, ought to be, before they break bread.<a name=418:1></a> If a person be inside without one's being aware of it, or even were dying, or only waiting the possibility of doing it, one might bear and wait, but it is clear that in scripture they came in externally by baptism.<a name=418:2></a> I have baptised a great many Quakers' and Baptists' children who never had been and when I found unbaptised persons breaking bread, spoken with them, though then waiting till they saw clear.<a name=418:3></a> But it is not order.<a name=418:4></a> I look at it as the orderly entrance among Christians -- the company God has upon earth.<a name=418:5></a> I think from scripture the children of those within have the privilege to be brought in; "Of such is the kingdom of heaven:" and they are holy, not unclean as the children of a Jew who married a Gentile.<a name=418:6></a> The being a member of the body is through the baptism of the Holy Ghost.<a name=418:7></a> But precepts are given to children, and they are to be brought up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.<a name=418:8></a> Having been once thus admitted, they cannot be admitted over again.<a name=418:9></a> But I never seek to persuade any one of children's baptism.<a name=418:10></a> The only commission to baptise was to the twelve to baptise Gentiles (not Jews), and it went from resurrection not ascension; they were (to) disciple nations and baptise them.<a name=418:11></a> This they afterwards left to Paul, who tells us he was not sent to baptise; though clearly it was not abrogated.<a name=418:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not add any argument against baptist views.<a name=418:13></a> Its being obedience is given up by all who have really looked into scripture.<a name=418:14></a> The Lord's supper is the sign of the unity of the body, and that is the bond we own; but it is quite clear from scripture, that when people become Christians they were admitted by baptism amongst the rest: but it has nothing to do with the unity of the body, but admission by a form which expresses Christ's death as their way in.<a name=418:15></a> When thus admitted, they are in once for all, and cannot be admitted again.<a name=418:16></a> Hence, even Baptists, if they found a person, baptised by them, unconverted, who afterwards believed, they would not baptise them again; and they are right in my judgment.<a name=418:17></a> If a person breaking bread was found never to have been baptised at all, I should merely rectify an irregularity as quietly as possible.<a name=418:18></a> It is as men speak, the cart before the horse.<a name=418:19></a> We have a case here of a young person just brought to the Lord, and it is quite understood she was to be baptised first.<a name=418:20></a>

		It is not "our gospel" with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven, but "this gospel of the kingdom" that was preached when John Baptist was there, and by the Lord Himself.<a name=423:21></a> Let it be remembered now that we have no date for the rapture of the church -- that the dates begin with a week of Daniel 9, and half a week of great tribulation when the sacrifice is made to cease.<a name=423:22></a> But this does not affect the general testimony of Matthew 24 which may begin before the week, and be carried on among the Gentiles during the great tribulation at Jerusalem.<a name=423:23></a> Only the Church must be caught up, it seems, before the accomplishment of a renewed testimony of the kingdom apart from what has gathered the Church.<a name=423:24></a> The final previous testimony to the nations is found in Revelation 14: 6.<a name=423:25></a> This takes away all date from the testimony to the nations, save the relative one that the Church is gone.<a name=423:26></a> But when we remember that all is done with accelerated rapidity in that day, a nation born in a day, a short work to be made on the earth, that before Zion travailed she brought forth, that for the elect's sake God has shortened the days, we may look for a more rapid accomplishment of this work of testimony among the Gentiles also.<a name=423:27></a> There is another mission in Isaiah 66, but this is when the Lord has appeared in glory and judged all flesh, and it results in bringing up scattered Israel.<a name=423:28></a> The dispensational value of the gospel of Matthew has not (I think) been adequately estimated by students of the word.<a name=423:29></a><br>[1873.<a name=423:30></a>]

		DEAR BROTHER, -- I must answer Yes, and No.<a name=424:1></a> The Lord by His death has annulled his power (Hebrews 2), but death is not yet formally abolished: it is the last enemy that will be.<a name=424:2></a> The church and the Christian ought to be out of Satan's power: Christ has so gotten the victory that those who are His when He comes will not die at all.<a name=424:3></a> Still in himself Satan remains, having the power of death, and death itself is not gone.<a name=424:4></a> Hence we read of delivering to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the Spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord; but the Christian is not properly under his power at all.<a name=424:5></a> Death belongs to him: Paul, Apollos, life, death, things present and things to come, But if he gets out of christian walk he may be subjected to it, yet not so as to be out of the control and reach of God's hand.<a name=424:6></a> We see the connection of God's chastening and Satan's power in Job.<a name=424:7></a> He is not yet bruised under our feet.<a name=424:8></a> When allowed he may have this power.<a name=424:9></a> "Satan shall cast some of you into prison.<a name=424:10></a>" "Be thou faithful unto death and I will give thee a crown of life.<a name=424:11></a>" .<a name=424:12></a>.<a name=424:13></a>.<a name=424:14></a> Hence, so far as we are not walking in the power of that life we may come under it, but not without God's hand who uses it for chastening.<a name=424:15></a>

		MY DEAR BROTHER, -- There are many points to be made clear in your letter: first, as to Hebrews 12, it has nothing to say to continual cleansing; "the blood of sprinkling" is a general expression drawn from Judaism, blood being so used for cleansing.<a name=425:1></a> But it is used in contrast to Abel's blood which cried for vengeance, Christ's for mercy, and indeed speaks of prospective millennial blessing, and the gathering together in one of all in heaven and earth.<a name=425:2></a> That the blood of Christ remains in perpetual value before God, I do not doubt a moment; but, spiritually speaking, it has been sprinkled, and that is presenting it to God, <i>not sprinkling</i> it on anything of ours.<a name=425:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the great point which wants clearing up is confounding imputation and communion and its interruption.<a name=425:4></a> First John speaks of fellowship or communion, not of imputation.<a name=425:5></a> The priesthood in Hebrews is not for sins, save in the one great act of reconciliation -- it is for mercy and grace "to help in time of need" (chapter 4) -- for the simple reason that "by one offering he hath perfected <i>for ever</i> them that are sanctified" through it; and "for ever" signifies without break or intermission: as He is sitting constantly (Hebrews 10: 12) at the right hand of God, we are constantly perfect.<a name=425:6></a> (verse 14) Hence "the worshippers once purged should have no more conscience of sins.<a name=425:7></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to sins after conversion, the whole thing is a mistake, leaving out Christ's work, and thinking of the state of our conscience and the Spirit's work in us.<a name=425:8></a> The sins we have committed can alone be on our conscience, but as to the effectual work that puts them away, all our sins were future when Christ bore them.<a name=425:9></a> Did He bear our sins up to the day of our conversion and not after?<a name=425:10></a> If so they never can be forgiven at all, and we must be lost; He cannot die any more; "for then must he often have suffered.<a name=425:11></a>" Read Hebrews 9, 10, which treat these questions elaborately.<a name=425:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Washing with water is quite another thing; it is the application of the word by the Holy Ghost.<a name=425:13></a> Once thus born, that work cannot be repeated, but the least word or evil act interrupts communion, and the soul must be restored to communion.<a name=425:14></a> So Christ is Advocate to this effect; but there (1 John) fellowship is treated of; and the ground of this advocacy, instead of imputation, is, that the righteous One (our righteousness) is always there, and the blood of propitiation always valid.<a name=425:15></a> We are in Christ, and there is no condemnation for those who are in Him; and in another aspect He always appears in the presence of God for us.<a name=425:16></a> The sprinkling of the leper does not affect the question: there was no repetition of fault for renewed cleansing; it was, when cured, the ground of all restoration to communion.<a name=425:17></a> Sins are worse after believing, for it is sinning against known love; and the measure of responsibility is greater; we are "to walk as he walked," and manifest the life of Jesus in all things.<a name=425:18></a> Nor is anything passed over.<a name=425:19></a> Advocacy may restore, and we judge ourselves -- else we are judged, chastened that we may not be condemned.<a name=425:20></a> I think it is a mistake to apply "the blood of Jesus cleanseth us" to past or present faults.<a name=425:21></a> It is an abstract statement, as I may say, Medicine cures the ague.<a name=425:22></a> "If we walk in the light, as he is in the light," is the same; it is the Christian's place as such.<a name=425:23></a> "Hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience," etc.<a name=425:24></a> (Hebrews 10: 22), refers, I have no doubt, to the priest's consecration which was done once for all.<a name=425:25></a> The value of Christ's blood was the ground for everything, we cannot account of it too highly, but it was the golden plate with "holiness to the Lord" which met the iniquities of their holy things.<a name=425:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe I have answered from scripture all that you inquire of, or given what meets them all, at least.<a name=425:27></a> If anything remains not cleared up, I shall be glad to write again.<a name=425:28></a> It is well for the saints to be clear on these things, and in these days especially.<a name=425:29></a>

		DEAR MRS.<a name=429:1></a> -- , -- I find the same confusion of sin and sins as among them all consciously and wilfully, the same gross mistake as to where we are to be conformed to Christ.<a name=429:2></a> It is the fruit of the generally low estimate of what Christianity is, and in judging this may be useful.<a name=429:3></a> Do doubts and fears depart by surrender to Jesus?<a name=429:4></a> Take his use of 1 John 3: 6 and compare 9, and see if it be just.<a name=429:5></a> In 13 all is the same confusion and a perpetual cleansing by blood, which though to be borne with as ignorance, is all wrong.<a name=429:6></a> Also it applies to sins, not sin.<a name=429:7></a> Again in 1 John 1: 8 confusion of sin and sinning, "an omission deliberately decided on," puzzled her, and trust in Jesus settled it.<a name=429:8></a> But, he that knows to do good and does it not, to him it is sin.<a name=429:9></a> It ought to have been a cause for distress, and was not inventing a cause for it.<a name=429:10></a> I judge there was very real mischief done her by her new news.<a name=429:11></a> She was intensely happy after a thorough evil working of sin in her, various ways of gratifying suggesting themselves to her mind; she was delivered, and no doubt the Lord makes us happy in delivering us, but she appears to me to take this sinful nature and positive dominion of sin in her for a time, uncommon easy.<a name=429:12></a> I admit all the grace that delivers, the positive intervention of Christ that delivers, but I should have been, while blessing Christ for His grace, miserable at having had all this working in me; have said, 'if you had been fuller of Christ this would not have been the case -- there has been negligence in prayer, want of diligence of heart, consequent want of the sense of God's presence -- my fault has given Satan an advantage over me.<a name=429:13></a>' I see no trace of what she ought to have felt after such evil working in her heart.<a name=429:14></a> I do not stop to notice a very demonstrative nature and much reference to feelings, not that I think that the most expressed are the deepest; but all these traits tell me the low ground they are upon, comparing themselves with themselves -- themselves it may be set free, in which I rejoice, but all judged of by feeling of deliverance compared with previous bondage, all about themselves, and I may say, nothing about Christ.<a name=429:15></a> It is a sign of christian youth, not of maturity -- a babe in Christ speaks of what it feels, a mature Christian of what is in Christ.<a name=429:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All this may be useful in rousing to wants of soul something better than what is going.<a name=429:17></a> But it is a pity that if so, there should be so little knowledge of self and knowledge of Christ in it.<a name=429:18></a> It is interesting to see deliverance, but to give it out as a kind of wonderful standard is a mistake.<a name=429:19></a> It may be well that this side of what a Christian may feel should be set before souls.<a name=429:20></a> But you cannot but see that it is all what is produced in us, not what is in Christ and what Christ is.<a name=429:21></a> I do not want to depreciate spiritual attainment nor faith in promises.<a name=429:22></a> There are cases where we have to watch that mere knowledge does not displace and enfeeble it, but I cannot accept its being substituted for Christ where too the heart has not given itself up altogether to the Lord, the declarations of those who have may awaken the conscience.<a name=429:23></a> Many, alas, are far from having done it, and if not watched the world and self creep in, let it be judged.<a name=429:24></a> But I ask after reading the book, if Miss F.<a name=429:25></a> K.<a name=429:26></a> H.<a name=429:27></a> and Mr.<a name=429:28></a> W -- do not rest on the mind more than Christ.<a name=429:29></a> This may be useful to awaken, not to mature.<a name=429:30></a> And now mark how dangerously and mischievously scripture has to be changed for the system.<a name=429:31></a> He adds to sinning, wilfully and consciously.<a name=429:32></a> Scripture says if a man sin wilfully there is no remedy, and what so grieved Paul certainly was not sin in Romans vii.<a name=429:33></a> Further, unconscious sins if they flow from carelessness are a more serious ground of judgment maybe than conscious ones.<a name=429:34></a> Again, "goes on cleansing," which was what comforted this lady, is quite false, and mischievously so.<a name=429:35></a> It is a bad sign when we have to change scripture to make it do.<a name=429:36></a> So, complete in Him; this is what all Christians are said to be.<a name=429:37></a> I do not doubt true heartedness and sincerity -- superiority to myself in many feelings, but I cannot see maturity in Christ.<a name=429:38></a> As I have said, a young Christian speaks much of self and what it feels natural when they are young -- old ones who know themselves, much of Christ.<a name=429:39></a> I do not find in any of them Christ has His place.<a name=429:40></a> It is well to awaken, but putting it as a model lowers the standard and means of advance towards it.<a name=429:41></a> What is beneath the surface is hidden by the glowing expressions of what is in it.<a name=429:42></a> I want to get the spectrum of what the sun is made of, and not merely the photosphere, and then Christ will have a larger place Himself.<a name=429:43></a>

		As to the printing I am indifferent.<a name=431:18></a> I should prefer writing, because more connected with personal intercourse in giving them in, and less routine; because, too, if sent to printer, then they are without any consultation at all, and if the visitors do not come, which is then very likely, they must be given out without more, or struck out without communication with those who send them.<a name=431:19></a> But all these are merely instrumental means of getting things done, and if it all works well I am content .<a name=431:20></a>.<a name=431:21></a>.<a name=431:22></a> .<a name=431:23></a> The printing is to gain time; if all non-London meetings were off, half the time would be saved, and more real work done; and the casting of the responsibility on the different gatherings in each place I believe to be most important.<a name=431:24></a> In London we are all in one place, however large.<a name=431:25></a> I never could have said, If the papers are given up -- I might have said that if they were made independent churches -- I could not go with them.<a name=431:26></a> The papers were a real means of hindering this, and with all defects they had worked well .<a name=431:27></a>.<a name=431:28></a>.<a name=431:29></a> .<a name=431:30></a>

		[To the same.<a name=433:1></a>] Dear G C Makrow, -- It is fair to tell you that reflection has made me much more averse to printed papers than I was.<a name=433:2></a> I have not heard anything new from others which acted on me; the grounds of my increased objection have arisen in my own mind.<a name=433:3></a> I do not enter into details, for my difficulty has arisen from details in the first instance, and then from the whole tone and bearing of the thing.<a name=433:4></a> The mere fact of printing, or writing, is still nothing in itself to me.<a name=433:5></a> I still insist on all being put off the list who are not within London itself -- I have long done so.<a name=433:6></a> Not doing so was all very well to help little assemblies, newly formed, where no principle was concerned in it in any one's mind; but it subverts, as it stands now, the whole principle of local unity, which is the scriptural one as to localities -- holding the unity of all saints, as gathered into one, with that local unity.<a name=433:7></a> Helping, as a matter of grace, an assembly that was weak, was all very well, and all that thoroughly maintains general unity.<a name=433:8></a> Now the question as to the principle has been raised .<a name=433:9></a>.<a name=433:10></a>.<a name=433:11></a> .<a name=433:12></a> Grace will settle it peacefully.<a name=433:13></a> But my objection to the printed papers is quite other than it was when I wrote the reply to your letter.<a name=433:14></a>

		[H Turner] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- The work goes on so uniformly here, that there is little to relate.<a name=433:17></a> It wanted rousing so far as the brethren went -- no gospel, or even a room or a preacher.<a name=433:18></a> Yet my work has been of a peculiar kind, receiving all that came to the Tract Depot at 3 and 7.<a name=433:19></a>30.<a name=433:20></a> Various persons have come, ministers and others.<a name=433:21></a> Several have found peace, and what the true gospel ground is, and also the Lord's coming; and there for the present it rests .<a name=433:22></a>.<a name=433:23></a>.<a name=433:24></a> .<a name=433:25></a> I hope too, and with many, a plain gospel and a full one has been learned: some feed really on the Word, and are constantly there.<a name=433:26></a> But the state of souls, and even the best gospel they hear is deplorable, and the state of things felt .<a name=433:27></a>.<a name=433:28></a>.<a name=433:29></a> .<a name=433:30></a> Oh, if the Lord Himself was not the workman, how hopeless would be the thought of reaching all the souls that are in need.<a name=433:31></a> It is a comfort then to be able to look to Him, that His eye and grace may reach them.<a name=433:32></a> We read of the eyes of the Lord running to and fro through the earth to shew Himself strong in behalf of those whose hearts are perfect towards Him; and we may reckon on His grace too, to follow in faithful mercy all the need of His beloved people, and this is a consolation.<a name=433:33></a>

		We have had through this perfection question, which is only deliverance from Romans 7: the difference of full acceptance through Christ's work, as in Hebrews 10, and the washing of the feet with water very clearly brought out.<a name=433:34></a> The last is unknown to the Christians here: and making all forgiveness through re-sprinkling with blood diminishes the depth of holiness.<a name=433:35></a> It is men getting clear -- not clean really.<a name=433:36></a> I have been struck in connection with this, with the extreme jealousy of defilement in Numbers 19.<a name=433:37></a> It was no sprinkling with blood, but that being sprinkled in the tabernacle, and sin consumed -- then for communion, all unholiness and nature consumed on the cross, all defilement measured by that cross, and the word and Spirit (the water).<a name=433:38></a> Whatever touched was unclean; the priest was, the sprinkler was till even, all in the tent and that were not purged out -- all the value of the day of atonement supposed, and the question of communion raised.<a name=433:39></a>

		[H Turner] DEAREST BROTHER, -- The subject you write on has occupied me lately.<a name=434:1></a> The Romans is simply forgiveness and grace taken by themselves, as noted, down to chapter 5: 11.<a name=434:2></a> The full state of the Christian also is clear.<a name=434:3></a> These, though distinct, you cannot separate John 20: 22 and Pentecost -- as Romans 8 shews.<a name=434:4></a> Thus far all is simple.<a name=434:5></a> "Justification of life," I have lately seen, refers to chapter 5: 16, 17: still it is a real thing, meeting death coming in, and all sinning, and many offences.<a name=434:6></a> Still it seems to me liberty or deliverance has a double aspect -- before God, and from the law of sin.<a name=434:7></a> It is all in redemption, it is true; but, though brought to God -- delivered as well as forgiven -- there was no circumcision in the wilderness.<a name=434:8></a> The Red Sea brought out, the Jordan brought in; yet they coalesce.<a name=434:9></a> The wilderness formed no part of the object or purpose of God, but only of His ways.<a name=434:10></a> He does not say a word of it when visiting Israel in Egypt, nor is there in the song in Exodus 15.<a name=434:11></a> Deliverance is complete as to redemption at the Red Sea: they are brought to God.<a name=434:12></a> Through the death and resurrection of Christ we are forgiven and delivered: forgiveness sets us free before God.<a name=434:13></a> But Romans always looks at the Christian as a man on the earth, alive in Christ and justified, but here.<a name=434:14></a> There is no life but the life of Christ, in one sense never was; only now that He is risen He gives it according to the power and in the relationship into which He is entered.<a name=434:15></a> But life is not what is preached but Christ -- repentance and remission of sins: the state of our relationship with God in ourselves or in Christ.<a name=434:16></a> "Ye must be born again" -- however true is not gospel.<a name=434:17></a> The display of life in us will be according to what faith holds as to these relationships.<a name=434:18></a> The ordinary scriptural order was, when convicted, remission of sins, and thereon receiving the Holy Ghost.<a name=434:19></a> This gives not a new life, but a life in the relationships into which such an one was entered; and this gave not only liberty before God in the knowledge of forgiveness, but freedom from the law of sin and death.<a name=434:20></a> I then know not merely that Christ died and delivered me, put me in a new place relating to what was past (then does not go any further), but as in this new place that it is identified with power of life and death to sin, as Romans 8: 2, 3.<a name=434:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have no rudiments of the world spoken of in Romans.<a name=434:22></a> It is guilt, sin in the flesh, law, justification, life in Christ, being in Him, but so as to have no condemnation and freedom from the law of sin, as the flesh condemned on the cross.<a name=434:23></a> I learn then that I am risen with Christ, and talk of rudiments of the world, having put off the old man, and so on.<a name=434:24></a> It is all true that I am in Christ and Christ is in me (Romans 8: 1, 10); but a person is not in the christian state till he has the Spirit of Christ.<a name=434:25></a> (verse 9) To chapter 5: 11 it is simply God for us in respect of guilt and all its consequences in relationship with Him -- from chapter 5: 12, experimentally learned, our state.<a name=434:26></a> You have the Spirit in chapter 5; the love of God shed abroad in the heart.<a name=434:27></a> A person may go through chapter 7 before being in the beginning of chapter 5; it may be after, though it will be modified.<a name=434:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But however full the gospel you preach, if effectual it brings the soul to the consciousness of its then actual state with God.<a name=434:29></a> But it will never get into peace till it ceases from the search whether it has life, and looks to Christ as a Saviour.<a name=434:30></a> It is a matter of teaching that Christ is our life, nor is there any other; and now it is life as risen, but its movements must be according to our conscious relationship with God.<a name=434:31></a> The disciples had life in John 20: 22.<a name=434:32></a> In Romans 8 the Spirit is first named as source and power of life, and then as a personal Spirit in us: that is, both as John 20: 22, and Pentecost.<a name=434:33></a> But this only is the proper Christian condition as chapter 8: 9 shews.<a name=434:34></a> I would not say with the fullest gospel a man might not get into Romans 7, possibly by mixing it with ideas he had already.<a name=434:35></a> But the knowledge of salvation by the remission of sins, and thereon sealing, is the gospel order -- whatever we learn afterwards -- and life in that relationship; and that is life in resurrection in itself.<a name=434:36></a> But faith in the Person of Christ gives life, and thereon a person is not sealed nor has peace, but there is confidence -- not law -- forgiveness known, but imperfectly: so the poor woman in Luke 7.<a name=434:37></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The truth of risen life in Christ and the coming of the Holy Ghost are distinct; but now that both are fulfilled the divine order is the knowledge of the remission of sins and receiving the Holy Ghost, and thus the two are inseparable.<a name=434:38></a> Then I know, or may know, that I am in Christ; whereas the forgiveness known before by the gospel is of past sins -- what my conscience needed.<a name=434:39></a> The life we receive is in Christ risen, but I am not consciously -- much more than knowledge -- in John 20: 22, now that the Holy Ghost is come, till I receive the Holy Ghost.<a name=434:40></a> Romans 8 puts them inseparably together.<a name=434:41></a> I have to see that a man in faith's relationship is in Romans 7, or whether it is merely lack of knowledge; for in Romans 7 he has not in fact received the Holy Ghost, is not married to Christ.<a name=434:42></a> A man may have to learn himself afterwards, but if he has the Spirit he is married to Christ, though he may have to learn things experimentally.<a name=434:43></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards Titus 3 the renewing here is an absolutely new thing ajnakaivnwsi".<a name=434:44></a> Renewing when connected with justification always comes first.<a name=434:45></a> Justification is true only of a renewed person: we are sanctified to the blood of sprinkling.<a name=434:46></a> Brought into this new place administratively by baptism, and effectually by being created anew, we have this justification in hope of eternal life.<a name=434:47></a> The Holy Ghost does renew continually ajnaneou'sqai (Ephesians 4: 23) Colossians 1: 12 is always the state of the Christian, and the apostle looks at the Christian as in the Christian state (should even his mind be warped as in Galatians).<a name=434:48></a> Receiving the Spirit is an actual change of status not of title; but not merely knowing something.<a name=434:49></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I write with my head or nerves only just above water, but better and fully taken care of.<a name=434:50></a> It may be well to remember that, in a certain sense, the Red Sea closes the history.<a name=434:51></a> It is the salvation of Jehovah: the wicked come under death and judgment: the people of God are saved and brought to His holy habitation, as the thief went straight to Paradise.<a name=434:52></a>

		[H Turner] DEAR BROTHER, -- Your friend must be very prejudiced to think it Jesuitism, and not meeting the point that brethren are exclusive, because they will not go on in what they think disobedience, while they receive all true saints: as if my refusing to walk with some of a family who were doing what their father forbad proves surely [the want of] love to the rest of them, when I am free with all who are not disobeying This is a poor piece of reasoning -- a want of any clear conception of the case.<a name=437:1></a>

		I have run over M.<a name=437:2></a> Rainsford's: it is better than nine-tenths of what they get in the Establishment, but is as far as possible from clear truth.<a name=437:3></a> But his explanation of dead to sin is not sound at all, and leaves a person undelivered: it is a question of living in it or not, not of a penalty.<a name=437:4></a> No doubt Christ has taken the penalty, but there is a great deal more.<a name=437:5></a> And he leaves the Christian where he finds him, as to the point the apostle is treating, and I think, with a fuller statement of Christ being all, leaves saints where they generally are in the Evangelical world.<a name=437:6></a> His explanations and applications of scripture are very commonly incorrect.<a name=437:7></a> He knows nothing of the presence and anointing of the Holy Ghost -- union is by faith.<a name=437:8></a> Nor do I think there is real acquaintance with the exercises of a soul, nor of how scripture truth meets it.<a name=437:9></a> If a man is in Christ (and he puts him there at once as the first thing), penalty is gone (sin and sins being confounded), the man is judicially perfect but that is all: as to all else he is left pretty much where he was.<a name=437:10></a> Hence the extreme weakness of 13, and the false teaching of 14.<a name=437:11></a> Of deliverance from the power of sin in being out of Romans 7, he has not an idea.<a name=437:12></a> See again pages 190, 191, 214.<a name=437:13></a> This absolute identifying of "justified from sin" and "freed from sin" (the difference of which he notices to confound them again) characterises his state and doctrine -- besides confounding sin, and sins or guilt.<a name=437:14></a> Many other things I might remark, but the point of error in his teaching is the upsetting the special teaching of chapter 5: 12 to end of 8, specially 6, 7 and 8.<a name=437:15></a> That he makes Christ all for any souls is all well .<a name=437:16></a>.<a name=437:17></a>.<a name=437:18></a> .<a name=437:19></a>

		J G Deck, What I think serious in the state of all these bodies is, not one is really outside the camp.<a name=438:1></a> God has opened out much truth from His word, that is widely spread outside all gatherings; but there they do not move, and spoil it; but the loose brethren have generally lost it.<a name=438:2></a> For my own part, I feel what I have to do is to minister Christ to the want of the soul with which I have to do.<a name=438:3></a> As to a public testimony, though we may be humbled, the Lord is wise.<a name=438:4></a> If it were merely a question of New Zealand, Canada was worse till R.<a name=438:5></a> Evans went there.<a name=438:6></a> He was decided, and only one brother would let him into his house; now such a thing as a loose meeting is hardly known, and blessing has spread very widely.<a name=438:7></a> Christ suffices for the present state of the church, as for all.<a name=438:8></a> But one man in Israel's history went up to heaven without dying, and the state of Israel was such that he could not find a faithful man, though God knew such.<a name=438:9></a> There is no epistle where the apostle so much insists on courage as in 2 Timothy, when all was gone to the bad.<a name=438:10></a> My own deep conviction is that the church failed immediately the apostle was gone, just as Adam, and Noah, and Israel in Sinai, and the priesthood.<a name=438:11></a> The church as an historical body never knew what it was to be perfected for ever, and did not continue to own the Holy Ghost.<a name=438:12></a> God has taken us back to the Scriptures, to the word of God, and faith rests there owning the Holy Ghost as present till the blessed Lord takes us away.<a name=438:13></a> The standing of the Christian and of the church was lost at once with those to whom it was revealed, save as consigned to the written word.<a name=438:14></a> There I turn, owning the need and power of the Holy Ghost, while perfect acceptance in Christ is the starting-point for all our service as for all our hopes .<a name=438:15></a>.<a name=438:16></a>.<a name=438:17></a> .<a name=438:18></a> But I must close, casting myself on the Lord for all our service.<a name=438:19></a> The more we know of Him, the more we know He is everything.<a name=438:20></a> All else passes but He abides for ever, the Son of the Father's delight, and we associated with Him -- wondrous thought!<a name=438:21></a> but God's purpose, and now due to Him who has suffered that He may see the fruit of the travail of His soul and be satisfied -- satisfied in having us with and like Him.<a name=438:22></a> What infinite blessedness, and all to the glory of God for ever and ever.<a name=438:23></a> Must not our hearts be filled with it, and His love is our present joy!<a name=438:24></a>

		The thought of excusing oneself because it is the old man who acts is utterly false and evil.<a name=439:5></a> I am responsible and ought through the power of Christ who has set me free, to have kept the old man, or the flesh, if we are so to speak, down; not merely reckoning it dead, "but bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our body.<a name=439:6></a>" But it seems to me this paper<a href="#439:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> is defective in not adequately recognising the existence of flesh -- of what lusts against the Spirit.<a name=439:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not think there is any difficulty in scriptural statements where difficulties have not been made by those who wished to obscure the truth.<a name=439:8></a> When I say, "Not I, but Christ liveth in me," the soul taught of God knows that the I which does not live -- is not owned -- is the old Adam I.<a name=439:9></a> And when it says, "Not I, but sin that dwelleth in me," it gets the comfort of knowing, though not yet delivered, that the new life is a distinct thing.<a name=439:10></a> To the heart that walks experimentally, and is taught of God, all this is light, not obscurity.<a name=439:11></a> It is only so when false teachers seek to puzzle the soul.<a name=439:12></a>

		Next, I do 'attribute all evil found within to the old man.<a name=439:15></a>' Negatives are always dangerous things.<a name=439:16></a> 'As though' qualifies it, I admit, but very inadequately, because the evil is in and from the old man, or at least the flesh.<a name=439:17></a> The object of the sentence is right, but the form regrettable.<a name=439:18></a> So again: 'Strictly speaking, the old man has no present existence.<a name=439:19></a>' Now what is the meaning of this?<a name=439:20></a> Has the flesh no present existence?<a name=439:21></a> and am I not to distinguish it?<a name=439:22></a> I admit my responsibility fully to keep the flesh down, and I am to blame if I do not.<a name=439:23></a> But, though the old man may be used to signify my Adam existence without Christ, yet it is so used here as that the distinct existence of what lusts against the Spirit is ignored.<a name=439:24></a> We are told: 'If he find sin there, he must not plead for it in excuse that it is his old man [so far very well, only I should leave out 'for it,' and say 'in excuse' -- meaning plead for himself in excuse, not for it], but must honestly confess that it is himself.<a name=439:25></a>' I admit his fault, his responsibility fully.<a name=439:26></a> Through the Spirit he should have mortified the deeds of the body, and been full of Christ in the new man.<a name=439:27></a> But to say that it is himself, with the rejection of its being the old man, destroys, it seems to me, the force of the apostle's words: "Not I, but sin that dwelleth in me.<a name=439:28></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I admit the personal I.<a name=439:29></a> I admit the responsibility, and no excuse because the sin is there; but there is an ignoring the flesh, the two things contrary the one to the other, because scripture teaches, which it does, that the old man is put off.<a name=439:30></a> We are told the old man is of the past.<a name=439:31></a> In one passage the fact is admitted that the flesh lusts against the Spirit, but then how is what people really and experimentally mean by the old man, a part which has no present existence?<a name=439:32></a> If the paper adequately recognised the fact that the flesh is a present thing, I should not object at all to saying that the old man is a past thing; but this is not the case.<a name=439:33></a> I have put it off and put on the new; I am not in the flesh; and this is important, very important, to make clear.<a name=439:34></a> But the old man being habitually used for the flesh, even if incorrectly, and this being said to have no present existence, while the flesh is practically ignored -- I fear that defectiveness as to this latter point may mislead, as well as the error the paper justly combats.<a name=439:35></a><br>1875.<a name=439:36></a>

		MY DEAR BROTHER, -- .<a name=442:1></a>.<a name=442:2></a>.<a name=442:3></a> I write at once as to Hebrews 9 Diav is used for a state or condition, which affects the principle on which we act or receive anything, on which anything takes place.<a name=442:4></a> Thus, Romans 4: 11, dij ajkrobustiva"; Romans 2: 27, dia; gravmmato" kai; peritomh'".<a name=442:5></a> So it is in Hebrews 9: 11.<a name=442:6></a> As to paragevnomeno" though it be having come, it is not the act of coming e[rcomai, but being present in or for something by coming; coming into a certain condition, so that He is there, or come, in view of what is to be done when arrived.<a name=442:7></a> The verb in the sentence is eijsh'lqei ejfavpax, verse 12.<a name=442:8></a> He had taken the position of High Priest of coming good things; and this office was to be fulfilled, not in the present earthly tabernacle, but in a greater and more perfect one.<a name=442:9></a> The tabernacle is not, therefore, I think, the incarnation, for His priesthood (save the fact of atonement) was not on earth; it is exercised in connection with heavenly things, though there securing earthly ones for Israel: paragevnomeno" is entering into the condition of priesthood, not incarnation or glory, and that is connected with the heavenly tabernacle.<a name=442:10></a> The fact of His going in is in 24 as in 12; this referring to eternal redemption, which He had found; that, to the fact of His abiding presence before God there for us; but in both eijsevrcomai, the act of going in -- not paragivnomai what He had come to be or do, the condition entered into or in view.<a name=442:11></a> I do not consider dia; aimato", or tou' ijdivou aimato" as instrumental, but to be used in the sense already referred to.<a name=442:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The "end of the ages," or "consummation of the ages," are all the dealings of God with man to test his general condition.<a name=442:13></a> In this general sense the state of innocence comes in; but the proper connection is what is after the fall, yet not looking at man as lost, but testing his state and whether he was recoverable, or was lost and had to be saved.<a name=442:14></a> Without law; under law; God manifested in the flesh, were the great features of this.<a name=442:15></a> Hence in John 12.<a name=442:16></a> the Lord says, "Now is the judgment of this world.<a name=442:17></a>" Though there was testimony there were no religious institutions before the flood, unless the fact of sacrifices.<a name=442:18></a> There were after: government; promises to Abraham, shewing It was grace to one separated from an idolatrous world and head of a new race; the law; the prophets; and at last the Son as come, not as offered.<a name=442:19></a> Then God laid the foundation of His own purposes in righteousness
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The difference is that in John 1: 29 it is the sin <i>of the world</i>; in Hebrews 9 it is to put away sin more generally.<a name=442:20></a> Neither will have full accomplishment till the new heavens and the new earth.<a name=442:21></a> In this last passage we have to distinguish between it and bearing the sins of many.<a name=442:22></a> The last concerns us, and purging our conscience.<a name=442:23></a> I do not think it has been adequately seen how all good and evil has been brought to an issue in the cross -- in that place of sin before God, that is, in Christ made sin (though in the last words it is for us, 2 Corinthians 5: 21).<a name=442:24></a> We have the absolute wickedness of man and enmity against God in goodness; the complete power of Satan, "your hour and the power of darkness;" the prince of this world leading all men, the disciples having fled; man in his absolute perfection, in whom that prince had nothing, but there was perfect love to the Father and perfect obedience; man in absolute perfection, and that as made sin before God, where it was needed for God's glory, for it was where He was made sin that the obedience was made perfect, obedient unto death; God absolute in righteousness against sin, and perfect in love to the sinner.<a name=442:25></a> This, therefore, is the finished and so immutable ground of eternal perfectness.<a name=442:26></a> We cannot say as to the result sin is actually put away, save for us (2 Corinthians 5) who by the Holy Ghost know it; but the work is perfectly done on the ground of which there will be a new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness.<a name=442:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We must not confound "sin" and "sins.<a name=442:28></a>" He has borne the sins of many (they never can be remembered against us); loved and washed from them in His own blood -- our conscience, once purged, is made clean for ever.<a name=442:29></a> But sin is that alienation of all things, and first of all of our hearts, from God, which requires reconciliation of things in heaven and earth, which is not yet, and of ourselves which is; see Colossians 1: 20, 21, and many confirmatory passages.<a name=442:30></a> Christ then has been manifested for the total abolition of sin out of heaven and earth, defilement and alienation gone, besides <i>our</i> guilt being atoned for and our sins remitted; but both are by His sacrifice, in which God withal has been perfectly glorified in all that He is.<a name=442:31></a> The result is not yet wholly accomplished, nor will be fully till the new heavens and the new earth.<a name=442:32></a> The katacqovnia of Philippians 2: 10 are another thing; they bow but are not reconciled.<a name=442:33></a> I say this to avoid mistakes.<a name=442:34></a> The burnt-offering alone took the ground of sin, the sin-offering of sins.<a name=442:35></a> Romans also, 1: 17 -- verse 11, treats of sins; 5: 12 end of 8 of sin only, here only as to man on the earth: fevrein is as to sins; oJ airwn goes on to sin; sins are borne, sin put away.<a name=442:36></a> Of course <i>our</i> sins are wholly taken away, but that is "<i>our</i>.<a name=442:37></a>" He is never said to have borne the <i>sins</i> of all or of the world, or taken them away, but our sins, or those of many; but He is the oJ airwn of sin out of the universe, the taker-away of it, the result being not yet accomplished: eij" aJqevthsin (Hebrews 9: 26) is the result proposed, hJqevthse is not said.<a name=442:38></a> The work is done, the full result not yet brought about; but it is all in virtue of that, though power comes in to make it good, just as it does in the microcosm of ourselves, even as to the body in due time.<a name=442:39></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the question of "covenant" or "testament": "covenant" is always right, save in Hebrews 9: 16, 17.<a name=442:40></a> Even here it has been contested but it seems more simple to take it as "testament," an observation or allusion by the bye, diaqhvkh being in Greek covenant or testament or disposition.<a name=442:41></a> The voice of tou' diJaqemevnou has been the great bone of contention where it has been discussed- translated, if covenant, "the appointed" [sacrifice.<a name=442:42></a>] But this has seemed to me forced.<a name=442:43></a> Some have even made Galatians 3: 15, 16 "testament," but this, I judge, is entirely wrong.<a name=442:44></a>

		DEAR MR.<a name=444:1></a> -- , -- I do not know if you were at the meeting, and at any rate I can answer your questions undistracted here.<a name=444:2></a> Both sides of the gospel ought to be preached, and personal conviction of sin too, or repentance only founded on grace "my name.<a name=444:3></a>" As regards saint and sinner, a great many saints want a clear gospel, and at any rate rejoice in it, if they possess it.<a name=444:4></a> If sinners come, there ought to be a gospel for them.<a name=444:5></a> But a full plain gospel is good for both.<a name=444:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There is what I have called a teaching gospel, say, like Hebrews 9 and half 10, 2 Corinthians 3, and other places.<a name=444:7></a> The facts are generally known, and much gospel preaching must be on the worth and bearing of facts, and that on heart and conscience, but the more the facts are insisted on, the more power I believe there will be.<a name=444:8></a> Christ, and what He has done.<a name=444:9></a> Dwelling exclusively on meeting the sinner's need, though true, and revealing God's love, always sweet to the soul, lays a narrow basis for after-growth.<a name=444:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards the arrangement.<a name=444:11></a> If there is a desire in the assembly to have the gospel, and there is an open door, both being most heartily to be desired of the Lord -- and there is no evangelistic gift in the assembly -- I know nothing to hinder, without a dream, their saying "Come over and help us.<a name=444:12></a>" The individuals being employed to seek one to come, is merely that the whole assembly cannot do it, and get one they trust to do it for them, and it is to be supposed that he does it in fellowship with the assembly; but except the moving spring of love to souls, the assembly merely furnishes the external opportunity, as I might open my house for the same purpose.<a name=444:13></a> He who comes to preach does it in the free exercise of his gift in his own responsibility to the Lord; for such ministry is directly from the Lord, and to be exercised in responsibility to Him.<a name=444:14></a>

		DEAREST BROTHER, -- Not one of the passages which Mr.<a name=445:1></a> -- quotes applies to the question.<a name=445:2></a> That those who have occupations, as -- and others, should evangelise all they can, is all very well, but that is not being given up to the work of evangelising where God has called us to it.<a name=445:3></a> -- speaks of deacons or evangelists.<a name=445:4></a> But deacons are not evangelists.<a name=445:5></a> Serving tables was set up that the apostles might not be hindered in evangelising; and when Stephen and Philip became evangelists, they gave up their place as deacons, at any rate Philip, for he left Jerusalem.<a name=445:6></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Providing for one's own -- though, of course, a man is bound to cherish and care for his wife -- speaks of a wholly different and indeed opposite case; that the church should not be charged with widows who had children, but that they, or young members of their family, should provide for them.<a name=445:8></a> I have gone through them all, and none apply at all, unless 2 Corinthians 12: 13, 14; nor does that.<a name=445:9></a> Paul had no wife, and no home, and no fortune, and tells us he had no certain dwelling-place.<a name=445:10></a> He would not take from the Corinthians because they were fond of money, but talks of it as a wrong, and that it was an extraordinary thing (but he took from others for the gospel's sake); and in 1 Corinthians 9 he discusses the whole matter on the ground that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.<a name=445:11></a> Peter led about a sister, a wife, and Paul insists that he and Barnabas had the same right, so did the brethren of the Lord, and the apostles.<a name=445:12></a> (1 Corinthians 9: 5) So that the direction of the word is quite plain: and heaps of brethren have done so on the Continent.<a name=445:13></a> If they have families, no doubt they must have a house; but the Lord has taken care of them, and their families have been educated, and get on just as other people's have.<a name=445:14></a> In one case there were eleven children.<a name=445:15></a> Of course, such cases require faith in a woman to undertake when in it.<a name=445:16></a> I have often seen them have more courage than men.<a name=445:17></a> My experience is wholly against him, called to be an evangelist, taking up a means of providing by other occupation.<a name=445:18></a> It is putting this world and human care before God's calling; and their spiritual work is spoiled in its very root.<a name=445:19></a> It is a wholly different thing, and the opposite as to faith, where those who have occupations break out of their bounds to evangelise.<a name=445:20></a> If a man be called of God to give himself up to evangelising, that is another matter, but departing from the path of faith is a serious thing.<a name=445:21></a>

		[E Dennett] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- There are two quite distinct truths or objects of thought brought before us in the Lord's supper: the death of the blessed Lord, and His remembrance now He is gone: and the unity of the body as partaking of one loaf We have to avoid at the same time any breaking away from scriptural truth on the, one side, and harshness and narrowness of feeling on the other.<a name=446:1></a> If love to all the saints is not present in my spirit, I break the unity of the Spirit, while keeping it up in form rightly according to scripture in outward practice.<a name=446:2></a> On the other hand, I cannot deny in practice what scripture teaches, and especially in that which is given as a sign of the scriptural truth.<a name=446:3></a> The words, Table of the Lord, are used to signify that identification with Him in confession which was found in the priests partaking of the altar, and the heathens eating of what had been offered to idols.<a name=446:4></a> I do not therefore object to use "the Lord's table" as an expression significant of this.<a name=446:5></a> Hence it necessarily embraces in principle all that are His, if not excluded by just discipline.<a name=446:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, as the various denominations either let in anybody, or meet professedly as such denomination, though they may allow, being such, a stranger to partake of it, the unity of the body and Christ's presence <i>in the assembly</i> is lost to faith, and <i>they</i> are still the church.<a name=446:7></a> But pious persons going to the communion at one of these places can enjoy, according to their piety, the remembrance of Christ, and of His dying love.<a name=446:8></a> I believe they lose by it, and certainly do, the present sense of the unity of Christ's body as a present thing on earth, for their faith does not embrace it; and in a measure the sense of Christ's presence -- that is, as there in the assembly, though they may realise it by the Holy Ghost for their own souls.<a name=446:9></a> I do not attach importance to words; but I could not own, with the light I have as to the unity of the body, that these denominational ordinances are the Lord's table; but I am quite ready to believe that souls may go there with a deeper sense than myself of the Lord's love personally.<a name=446:10></a> I do exceedingly enjoy the sense of His love there; but more than that, I own, as associated in heart with Him, the unity of the body, of those He gave Himself to gather together into one,<a href="#446:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> and own it scripturally according to His will in practice in that in which He has given expression to it; and denominationalism by being such does the contrary.<a name=446:11></a> But if I walk with my feet in the narrow path, from which I dare not stray, and find blessing in it, I desire to have my heart large enough to embrace all God's children walking before Him; and I lose in spirit the very blessing I am speaking of if I do not.<a name=446:12></a> "Your love," says the apostle, "to all the saints," "to comprehend with all saints.<a name=446:13></a>" We cannot properly realise the love of Christ in communion without taking in in its place all He loves as His.<a name=446:14></a> "Fellowship one with another" is one of the three elements of the christian state, its import far larger than we are apt to think; and if hindered in its manifestation by others, it ought only to be stronger within in our hearts in grace, and thinking of them with the Lord Himself "Everyone that loveth him that begat, loveth him also that is begotten of him.<a name=446:15></a>" But then, if it is love for His sake, this will be in obedience.<a name=446:16></a> Hereby we know that we love the children of God, if we love God, and keep his commandments.<a name=446:17></a> I cannot go out of the path He has marked out, to be with those I yet love.<a name=446:18></a> It would not be true love to them, not the love of God, to be disobedient, and set them at ease in what was wrong, treating it as no matter.<a name=446:19></a><br>[1877.<a name=446:20></a>]

		It is not true that revelation is only of the ages.<a name=450:18></a> Proverbs 8, and every statement of God's counsels and plans must be before the ages, for they are the source of this: so 2 Timothy 1: 9; Titus 1: 2; where it is expressly before them, and yet the life is aijwvnio".<a name=450:19></a> Is that for the ages?<a name=450:20></a> "In the beginning was the Word" is not in the ages.<a name=450:21></a> Nor do I admit that God is a relative term, nor Spirit.<a name=450:22></a> "I am" is not the only term that implies abstract being.<a name=450:23></a> It has been seriously called in question whether it does at all when first used, whereas another word does in Hebrew.<a name=450:24></a> The LXX have so taken it, namely, as 'being:' but thus aijwvn is the same word and so defined by Aristotle and by Philo.<a name=450:25></a> But the whole thing is fancy, unwarranted by scripture.<a name=450:26></a> And it seems to me a real want of charity to encourage him in the propagation of error, which must shut him out from the fellowship of those who respect the word of God, strengthening his hands in misleading others.<a name=450:27></a> I feel this part deeply.<a name=450:28></a>

		[J U Truen?<a name=452:1></a> (Very indistinct writing)] [From the French.<a name=452:2></a>] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- Our brother -- has communicated to me the state of your mind regarding our brother .<a name=452:3></a> It is no question of brotherly affection, but of the truth of God.<a name=452:4></a> Many of those who are most firm with regard to his position as teaching the error, have known him much longer than any among you, and have loved him before you knew him; but it is a question of the effect of the error on souls, and "he that loveth father and mother more than me," said the Saviour, "is not worthy of me.<a name=452:5></a>" The point to ascertain is, if this error is such as to touch the foundations of faith and the integrity of the word of God.<a name=452:6></a>

		I know that -- speaks of the Greek, but the force of the word eternal is perfectly clear in the word.<a name=452:7></a> "The things that are seen are temporal, but the things that are not seen are eternal.<a name=452:8></a>" (2 Corinthians 4: 18) The word signifies that which is not for time: it is the opposite.<a name=452:9></a> I am alarmed when they talk of Greek to those who know nothing of it.<a name=452:10></a> I know Greek and have examined it carefully, and I do not at all accept what they say of it.<a name=452:11></a> But the passage 2 Corinthians 4: 18 is there, without any need of the Greek; and when it is said, "these shall go away into everlasting punishment," the word has the same force.<a name=452:12></a> It is said that God shall be all in all.<a name=452:13></a> But that takes place when Christ shall have given up the kingdom to God the Father, but at that time it is said (Revelation 21: 8), that the wicked "shall have their part in the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone.<a name=452:14></a>" This doctrine touches then the authority of the word, and thus the foundations of faith.<a name=452:15></a> For when God shall be "all in all," will the devils and the demons be saved?<a name=452:16></a> What they say [of the expression] is but a fable.<a name=452:17></a> It is only the human race that have profited by it, and God is not "all in all" according to their idea.<a name=452:18></a> But if the demons are saved, it is not true that the death of Christ would be necessary for salvation, for here are those who are more wicked saved without His having died for them.<a name=452:19></a> Further, Revelation 20: 10 says expressly the contrary.<a name=452:20></a>

		What we need to know then is, whether affection for an individual should lead us to renounce the truth of the word of God.<a name=452:21></a> I do not believe it would be charity to encourage a brother in evil doctrine by acting as if it did not matter.<a name=452:22></a> I have seen a long list of passages quoted by our brother that had no reference to the question.<a name=452:23></a> I have already read numbers of books that propagate this doctrine, and it is only an effort to twist the word, by human sentiment and reasonings to decide what God ought to do, and by no means submission to what He has said.<a name=452:24></a> It denies the expiation of Christ, for one can be saved without it: Judas himself, though "it had been good for that man if he had not been born," and the wicked, saved by means of long personal suffering, and not by the perfect redemption of Christ through faith, and that after their death in a sort of purgatory.<a name=452:25></a> Thus the evil of sin is attenuated.<a name=452:26></a> They invent on behalf of the man who has rejected Christ a sentimental mercy, which is not the mercy of grace, and which makes little of the blood and of the sufferings of Christ.<a name=452:27></a> Those who have openly rejected Him are saved like others, and it is a salvation that is not preached through Christ, who says that he that believeth hath everlasting life, and he that believeth not shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.<a name=452:28></a> They must find life somewhere else than in the gospel.<a name=452:29></a> I know they speak of "the restitution of all things," but they leave out what follows, the end of the sentence, "of which the prophets have spoken.<a name=452:30></a>" I do not deny that a Christian may be seduced by these things -- then it is desired that we should not judge him; but this is not according to the word.<a name=452:31></a> We only judge those who are within, and the word of God tells us to reject a heretic "after the first and second admonition.<a name=452:32></a>" I repeat, dear brother, there are those who have loved -- before you knew him, but that does not alter the truth of God.<a name=452:33></a> True charity is firm, whilst at the same time gentle, for the good of others.<a name=452:34></a> May God keep you, and restore our brother -- , is the wish and prayer of yours

		Dear Miss W Winslow, -- Conscience -- besides the sense of responsibility, obligation to God, which was before the fall, and belongs necessarily to all morally intelligent creatures -- is the knowledge of good and evil entered into at the fall, the sense of things being right and wrong; not a law imposed by authority, and the measure of the right and wrong, but the sense in ourselves that a thing is right, or a thing is wrong.<a name=454:16></a> "The man is become as one of us to know good and evil.<a name=454:17></a>" Heart is a very general expression for all the inner man: "if our heart condemns us" -- then it is conscience; my heart sheweth me, then it is spiritual perception; we are to love God with all our heart, then it is the ordinary modern sense; but in scripture, heart is all in which moral exercise is in us.<a name=454:18></a> "Once purged" is the conscience, as sin being imputed; (see Hebrews 9) "perfect as pertaining to the conscience;" and being done on the cross once for all, when known by faith it cannot change, for it is that one work known which changes not.<a name=454:19></a> Our feelings may be dull, and we may look to them, but the blood of Christ has always its same value in the sight of God.<a name=454:20></a> He cannot, as undervaluing it, see iniquity in us.<a name=454:21></a> Hebrew 10 develops this fully.<a name=454:22></a> There can be no altering or repetition of the blood.<a name=454:23></a> Imputed guilt does not exist for the believer: but he may fail, and by this his communion with God is interrupted; the operation of the Spirit is to humble him, and lead him to confession -- most profitable, but not communion.<a name=454:24></a> The word applied by the Spirit works in the soul to judge sin according to Christ's death, and then its putting away according to it, and so the enjoyment of the love which did it; and then communion is restored.<a name=454:25></a> Numbers 19 and John 13 and 1 John 2 develop this.<a name=454:26></a> Compare Ephesians 5: 26 of the church.<a name=454:27></a> The feeling and joy of assurance may be dimmed, but faith rests assured of the acceptance by God of the blood of Christ.<a name=454:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to temptation, I believe a person may so walk by the power of the Spirit, realising Christ, that no conscious evil thought may be there; but a state in which there is no temptation is a delusion.<a name=454:29></a> Nor is temptation all: there is the second class of flesh's working where there is no temptation, "now ye also put off all these.<a name=454:30></a>" Then there is failure in that sense of Christ's presence which hinders idle words, impatience of spirit.<a name=454:31></a> What is called the higher christian life is only the getting out of Romans 7 into 6 and 8 -- a very real thing; and that which the great body of teachers would have you content without, and this is all wrong, it is not the christian state.<a name=454:32></a>

		[Hayhoe] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- The case is evidently an exceptional one.<a name=456:1></a> Other considerations too enter into it, as to which I have no information, as whether the providence of God carried them to a place where they have no opportunity of breaking bread, or their own will, or worldly motives.<a name=456:2></a> Of this I say, because I know, nothing.<a name=456:3></a> But it would affect the question.<a name=456:4></a> The presence of one sister, if not sought, would not affect me much.<a name=456:5></a> They ought not, I think, to do it as a regular gathering so to speak; if they could occasionally get a brother to come, they might wait for such an opportunity.<a name=456:6></a> But if all this be impracticable I could not say that they should for ever be deprived of it.<a name=456:7></a> But in a country where other opportunities may evidently occur, they should do it only when their souls felt the need of it, and assuming that there were no other means of meeting that need, with no teaching or pretension to be a regular assembly.<a name=456:8></a> It is only a case of meeting a need when there is no other means There is neither male or female in Christ Jesus; but everything has its place and order in the church of God.<a name=456:9></a> And I repeat, it should not be as a regular assembly, but as meeting a need which could in no other way be met.<a name=456:10></a> May the Lord keep them near Himself.<a name=456:11></a>

		MY DEAR BROTHER, -- If the assembly decided that this person could not be received, as refusing to give up the 'Oddfellows,' the absence of some brethren would not be a reason for rescinding the decision; because that depends on the Lord's being there when gathered in His name, not on such and such an individual being there -- assuming that they have been regularly gathered in the Lord's name.<a name=458:1></a> I do not know much about 'Oddfellows,' but from what I do know I am surprised a Christian can be a member.<a name=458:2></a> It is a thoroughly worldly society.<a name=458:3></a> They could not be there in the name of the Lord.<a name=458:4></a> You say -- 'nothing against his walk;' but this was part of his walk.<a name=458:5></a> I could understand giving him time to think over it, if he were in before taking up the case.<a name=458:6></a> His refusal to give it up till he saw fit when it was brought before him, was a proof of his state of soul, and brings in another point: that the conscience of the individual is to judge of right and wrong, not the assembly.<a name=458:7></a> Now there are things that we must have latitude to individual conscience; but to lay it down as a rule, that an assembly is to submit in its walk to the judgment of my conscience is a bad state of soul.<a name=458:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The meeting of the assembly as such is not confined to the breaking of bread: whenever they agree to meet, due notice being given of it, they are met as the assembly.<a name=458:9></a> If it were done so as purposely to exclude some, that would be another thing.<a name=458:10></a> If godly, serious, brethren have difficulty in putting out, it is better to wait till the Lord makes the case clearer But this did not apply here, because it was the positive act of receiving which was in question: but his admission might be provisionally suspended in the same case till the matter was cleared up.<a name=458:11></a> But if it were merely factious opposition to the common mind of the assembly -- one who identified himself with evident positive evil -- he must cease or become subject to discipline himself.<a name=458:12></a> Such is the rule of the apostle in Corinthians.<a name=458:13></a> But such rules are only carried out by grace and the power of the Spirit of God.<a name=458:14></a> I can speak only of general principles, for very small circumstances change a case completely, and of course I have only heard one side.<a name=458:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I as a rule, too, object to brethren not in the gathering meddling with its discipline, because the conscience of the gathering is in question; though of course they may be helpful if given grace by God to judge maturely of things.<a name=458:16></a> But we are called to peace, and even a mistake in judgment ought not to disturb it.<a name=458:17></a> I attach great importance to the judgment of the assembly, but it must be the assembly as such, not individuals however true and wise, because of the promise.<a name=458:18></a>

		As regards the second question: the principle of meeting is the unity of the body, so that a person known as a Christian is free to come: only the person who introduces him should have the confidence of the assembly as to his competency to judge of the person he introduces.<a name=459:5></a> In London and elsewhere the name of the person introducing is given out; or if many know him, that is mentioned and they are responsible.<a name=459:6></a> Looseness is so prevalent now among the denominations that more care is needed; but I hold that every known Christian has the same title as myself; and membership of an assembly I totally reject.<a name=459:7></a> But I do not accept running out at a person's fancy: they may have been sinning or walking disorderly; and a person breaking bread is thereby subject to the discipline of God's house, if called for, just as if he had been constantly there.<a name=459:8></a> Nor do I accept any condition from them, as that they are free to go anywhere: the assembly is to follow God's word, and can bind itself by no condition.<a name=459:9></a> Nor do I impose any; because as the assembly is bound by the word and can accept none, so is the person subject to the discipline of the assembly according to the word.<a name=459:10></a>

		I have never changed my views at all.<a name=459:11></a> The practice is more difficult because of the growing looseness in doctrines and practice of all around.<a name=459:12></a> But if an assembly refused a person known to be a Christian and blameless, because he was not of the assembly, I should not go.<a name=459:13></a> I own no membership but of Christ.<a name=459:14></a> An assembly composed as such of its members is at once a sect.<a name=459:15></a> But the person who brings another is responsible to the assembly, and should mention it; for it is the assembly which is finally responsible, though it may trust the person who introduces another in the particular case.<a name=459:16></a> If it were a young Christian, or one of little maturity and weak in the faith, I should like to know what sure ground there was before allowing him to break bread, on the same principle as in all other cases.<a name=459:17></a>

		-- - The doctrine of the Reformation put forth the view that Christ died to reconcile His Father to us -- a statement every way erroneous, confounding the name of relationship in blessing with God in His nature; and teaching, what scripture does not, that Christ's work was to reconcile God to us, to change His mind.<a name=460:1></a> But others have used this to deny real propitiation and atonement.<a name=460:2></a>

		But not only do these passages shew the moral absurdity of this notion to every spiritually-intelligent Christian, but there is no such thought in scripture as the soul's sleeping.<a name=464:10></a> It is a beautiful expression, signifying that death was only falling asleep to awake again; but it is the man always that falls asleep, never the soul.<a name=464:11></a> Thus in the case of Lazarus.<a name=464:12></a> Then said He "plainly, Lazarus is dead [or has died].<a name=464:13></a>" That is, falling asleep means, plainly expressed, dying.<a name=464:14></a> So when Stephen was killed, he fell asleep -- Stephen did, not his soul: so "some are fallen asleep;" it is in contrast with, "some remain unto this present.<a name=464:15></a>" "All live to him.<a name=464:16></a>" Were the souls of the rich man and Lazarus fallen asleep?<a name=464:17></a> They tell me it is a Jewish figure.<a name=464:18></a> I agree with them: but it is not a figure of the soul being asleep.<a name=464:19></a> The falling asleep is always attributed to <i>the man</i>, never to <i>the soul</i>, and always means the Christian's dying; and is a beautiful expression for his not being, as we say, 'dead and gone.<a name=464:20></a>'

		I suppose the chapters alluded to are John 3 and 6.<a name=467:22></a> Now the latter chapter proves conclusively that it does not refer to the Lord's supper, for it affirms that every one is surely and finally saved who so eats of Christ.<a name=467:23></a> Christ Himself is the bread of life, and he that eats of it lives for ever.<a name=467:24></a> (verse 51) The 'sacrament' is nothing here; but more particularly, 'he that eats my flesh and drinks my blood hath everlasting life, and I will raise him up at the last day," -- that is, he has present and final salvation.<a name=467:25></a> We have, too, e[fagon, as well as trwvgw -- original faith as well as present exercise of it.<a name=467:26></a> In chapter 3 we have only entering into the kingdom, nothing even attributed to water, whatever it means; and then life distinctly attributed to the Spirit, only as communicating a nature, "is spirit" -- is water, would be simple nonsense.<a name=467:27></a> I have no doubt that it is the word as in Ephesians 5 and John 15, and the necessary sense of chapter vi.<a name=467:28></a> confirms it; but in any case it has nothing to do with the communication of Life, and verse 6 shews it; and a reference to Ezekiel 36, to which it so very plainly alludes, leaves no doubt, I think, of its force -- hence verse 10, and the expression, "earthly things," in verse 12.<a name=467:29></a> I may refer to another chapter, perhaps, as none is mentioned: communion of the blood and body of Christ (1 Corinthians 10), but as it is the same word as "partakers" and "fellowship" in what follows, as in verse 18 (not 17), there is no kind of difficulty or uncertainty.<a name=467:30></a> It is moral identification with what is set forth there (see verse 20).<a name=467:31></a>

		As to Matthew 16, all the false system of the Papists and Ritualists flows to this point, from their confounding Christ's building and man's.<a name=467:56></a> "I will build," says Christ, against that the gates of hell cannot prevail.<a name=467:57></a> That building is not finished yet.<a name=467:58></a> In 1 Peter 2, the living stones come, but we hear of no human builder.<a name=467:59></a> In Ephesians 2, all is fitly framed together, and "groweth unto an holy temple;" but no builder is named.<a name=467:60></a> In 1 Corinthians 3, we have a wise master-builder, Paul, and wood and hay and stubble -- the contemplated fruit of man's responsibility -- and warning against it (not Christ's being the builder) and corrupters: reward of labour lost, and the person saved, the person purged, in these cases.<a name=467:61></a> Now, these men attribute the title and privileges of Christ's progressive building to the wood and hay and stubble of foolish and bad workers among men; yea, many to the corrupters and corruption themselves.<a name=467:62></a> In all this they are not taught of God at all.<a name=467:63></a> He tells us where there is the form of piety, denying the power, to turn away.<a name=467:64></a> To say that the wood and hay and stubble built in by bad workmen, or positive corruption, is the body of Christ, is a very monstrous thing; nor is the house the same thing as the body.<a name=467:65></a> There is no recognition of a finished salvation, and that I am in Christ, and for ever, and united to Him by the Holy Ghost.<a name=467:66></a> The failure of the outward professing church is a positive declaration of scripture, and that perilous times would come in the last days.<a name=467:67></a> And we are referred to scripture as the only sure guide in those days.<a name=467:68></a> (2 Timothy 3)

		Dear Mrs.<a name=471:1></a> Bevan, -- I am somewhat surprised that -- should be so far back on these subjects.<a name=471:2></a> But I can only touch on what is important in it.<a name=471:3></a> Thank God it has never injured fellowship amongst us a moment.<a name=471:4></a> Those of baptist views were -- a few of them, really only one I think -- excited for a moment, not (as -- thinks) by some retaining tradition, but by a very great many who had had baptist views giving them up, and when there were families, having their children baptised.<a name=471:5></a> I had last week two letters from such to get their children baptised.<a name=471:6></a> This those seeing otherwise, cannot understand.<a name=471:7></a> The great and mischievous mistake which baptists make is not seeing that there is a place of blessing set up by God, besides the fact of individual conversion.<a name=471:8></a> "What advantage then hath the Jew?<a name=471:9></a> .<a name=471:10></a>.<a name=471:11></a>.<a name=471:12></a> much every way: chiefly that unto them were committed the oracles of God.<a name=471:13></a>" They were not converted, the apostle is proving them all under sin, and as to the Jews just by reason of this.<a name=471:14></a> Then they say that was of Jews.<a name=471:15></a> No doubt: but this the apostle transfers to the christian body.<a name=471:16></a> The Israelites he says, warning Christians (1 Corinthians 10), "were all baptised to Moses in the cloud and in the sea, and did all eat the same spiritual meat, and drank the same spiritual drink, but with many of them God was not well pleased.<a name=471:17></a>" .<a name=471:18></a>.<a name=471:19></a>.<a name=471:20></a> That is, there is a sacramental introduction into the place of blessing which does not secure a person.<a name=471:21></a> The apostle goes on to warn them of the like thing happening to them.<a name=471:22></a> I am not using this to prove that infants are to be baptised, but that there is (the ignorance of which is the spring of all baptists' thoughts, namely) something set up by God on earth where He has set His promises, His blessings -- now His Spirit.<a name=471:23></a> "Ye are God's building," says he.<a name=471:24></a> But if a man build in wood, hay, stubble, his work will be burned: that is, what was set up according to God on earth may be spoiled when entrusted to the responsibility of man, but it did not cease to be God's building.<a name=471:25></a> Again, Romans 11 is the direct assertion that the Gentiles were graft into the tree of promise, where the root and fatness of the olive tree were, and were to take heed lest they also should be cut off, if they did not continue in God's goodness.<a name=471:26></a> That could not be if it were real conversion; here they are brought in where the blessing was, and yet are cut off for unfaithfulness.<a name=471:27></a> Judgment begins at the house of God.<a name=471:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The tares are the devil's sowing by false doctrines: that does not apply to a child.<a name=471:29></a> The Lord received children entirely differently; "of such is the kingdom of heaven," "their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.<a name=471:30></a>" Again -- calls them heathen, the word of God calls the children of a christian parent holy; that is <i>the opposite</i> to heathen.<a name=471:31></a> If a Jew married a heathen the Jew who was holy profaned himself, and the children had no title to be received as holy.<a name=471:32></a> Grace reigns now, and if one party be converted this one sanctifies the unbeliever, and the children are holy, and have a right to the privileges of the place of God set up in blessing, as in the Jewish case he had not.<a name=471:33></a> The child is not sanctified, but holy in contrast with unclean; that is, in scriptural phraseology, has right to come in.<a name=471:34></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God does not recognise <i>individuals</i> unconverted as such, save as to responsibility and judgment, as to which He does fully recognise them.<a name=471:35></a> But -- is quite wrong when she says that God recognises no third class.<a name=471:36></a> He does recognise as the church (Christ does) what He spues out of His mouth in judgment.<a name=471:37></a> He does recognise as His servant him whom He cuts asunder and appoints a portion with the unbelievers.<a name=471:38></a> "Blessed is that servant .<a name=471:39></a>.<a name=471:40></a>.<a name=471:41></a> But and if that servant say in his heart, .<a name=471:42></a>.<a name=471:43></a>.<a name=471:44></a> " and he is judged as such, and by much more terrible judgment because he has been in that place.<a name=471:45></a> All this I refer to to shew that a state of things, and a <i>relationship with God</i>, is positively contemplated and taught in scripture, and <i>on which judgment depends</i>, which is not founded on personal conversion: not merely responsibility because of what they knew, but which is called church but spued out of Christ's mouth, or servant yet has a portion with hypocrites and unbelievers, yet the Lord is "the Lord of that servant.<a name=471:46></a>" We get plain directions in 2 Timothy 2, 3, what to do in this case: turn away, purge ourselves, etc.<a name=471:47></a>, when the corruption and evil have taken the form there designated.<a name=471:48></a> But it does not cease to be God's building because wood, hay, and stubble are built in; the Holy Ghost is there which makes it God's building.<a name=471:49></a> Scripture, therefore, does speak of a third class; that is, of persons in relationship with God and responsible according to that relationship and cut off, rejected, judged, but whom the Lord judges as "Lord of that servant," and individually even cut off from the olive tree into which it had been grafted.<a name=471:50></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Besides, children of God and children of the devil are not called so till manifested.<a name=471:51></a> Take a person unconverted, afterwards brought to the Lord: I do not call him chaff, he is not burned with unquenchable fire; dead and lost he is, but not chaff: that is manifested in judgment, may be before.<a name=471:52></a> This seems to me precipitate.<a name=471:53></a> Further -- would have them presented to God and sanctified, that is flesh (chaff) presented to God and sanctified.<a name=471:54></a> Nothing can be more totally unscriptural.<a name=471:55></a> When a parent comes to me, to the church or assembly in principle, to do this, as they naturally would as -- feels; I say I cannot receive what is born of the flesh but by death, the death of Christ, and I baptise them to His death: -- presents them, sanctifies them without it.<a name=471:56></a> As to putting on Christ, does not believe what she says.<a name=471:57></a> Does she mean that a believer when baptised really and actually puts on Christ, as to life and being in Him?<a name=471:58></a> In contrast with becoming or being a Jew or Greek, barbarian, Scythian, bond, free, he puts on none of these things.<a name=471:59></a> A circumcised Gentile puts on Judaism in his profession and place, a baptised person puts on Christ.<a name=471:60></a> If not, every baptised person would be saved, and those not would be lost.<a name=471:61></a> But -- does not believe that by baptism they put on Christ thus.<a name=471:62></a> It applies professedly and explicitly to every baptised person absolutely, without any condition or limitation, and so I take it.<a name=471:63></a>

		These views then to me are in every respect unscriptural, nor did I ever find a Baptist who could stand on scripture.<a name=471:64></a> They are conscientious, and if they think they are not baptised at all, of course they ought to be so; I have no quarrel with them.<a name=471:65></a> Paul was not sent to baptise -- the Twelve were to baptise the <i>Gentiles</i> -- but baptism was accepted by Paul as already instituted.<a name=471:66></a> But he had no mission for it; whereas a special revelation was given to him of the Lord's supper, though both were alike instituted by the Lord.<a name=471:67></a> The commission of the Twelve was never that we know fulfilled.<a name=471:68></a> It was to disciple <i>the nations</i> and baptise them.<a name=471:69></a> The commission was on and from earth, not from heaven.<a name=471:70></a> Luke's was from heaven, beginning with Jerusalem.<a name=471:71></a> Mark makes it necessary to salvation, because it was professedly becoming a Christian; and I have so used it with a Jew who said he believed but would not be baptised, it would kill his mother.<a name=471:72></a> I cite it to shew the force of the passage.<a name=471:73></a> The cases of Philip and Cornelius prove conclusively that it was not obedience, but admission into christian privileges and position.<a name=471:74></a> I am now in the midst of a great baptised profession in which 2 Timothy 2, 3 tell me how to act.<a name=471:75></a> I may add, it is not a testimony to privileges already conferred, but the act of admission to them.<a name=471:76></a> I am baptised to His death, not because I have died.<a name=471:77></a> I wash away my sins not because my sins are washed away.<a name=471:78></a> I put on Christ, and am not baptised because I have put Him on.<a name=471:79></a> That is, it is the <i>formal</i> entrance into the privileges, not a witness that I have received them.<a name=471:80></a> I see no trace in scripture of its being a testimony to others, though every faithful confession of Christ turns to a testimony.<a name=471:81></a> Most of the ground -- takes is given up by those who maintain baptist views among brethren as untenable before scripture.<a name=471:82></a> I have never sought to convince or influence any one, and have no intention to do so.<a name=471:83></a> If they are content to follow their conscience I have nothing to say.<a name=471:84></a> But I am sure if scripture be right their views are wrong.<a name=471:85></a> If there be any light which I have not got which would lead me to it, that is another thing; but I am sure they have false views of the whole matter according to scripture.<a name=471:86></a> The root I conceive to be, making it all individual and obedience (which is absurd for a man cannot baptise himself), and not seeing that there is a place of blessing, and ground established by God on earth, which is not individual conversion, but is responsibility -- branches grafted in but broken off.<a name=471:87></a>

		[H C Anstey] DEAR BROTHER, -- I have no wish to keep up the Bethesda question, not that I judge the evil as less than I thought it, but that from the length of time many there are mere dissenters, and know nothing of the doctrine; so that they are really in conscience innocent, though gone in there as they would into any dissenting place.<a name=474:1></a> If this brother had never had anything to do with B.<a name=474:2></a> as such, I should have asked him nothing about it, as happens every day.<a name=474:3></a> But your account is that his separation was on account of looseness in discipline.<a name=474:4></a> What I think I should do would be not to discuss B.<a name=474:5></a> but shew him, say J.<a name=474:6></a> E.<a name=474:7></a> Batten's confession, where he states what they taught, and ask him simply if he held any of these, as they were the things that had made the difficulty.<a name=474:8></a> I should not ask anything about B.<a name=474:9></a> If he does not hold them I should not make any difficulty.<a name=474:10></a> I should gladly have patience with a godly brother who had seriously a difficulty.<a name=474:11></a> If it were merely wilful I do not feel that an assembly is bound to satisfy his wilfulness.<a name=474:12></a> This principle is recognised in 1 Corinthians distinctly.<a name=474:13></a> Otherwise one perverse person might keep evil in the assembly perpetually.<a name=474:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the word is inspired <i>by</i> Him, and no path can be His which is not according to it.<a name=477:11></a> But in many details of life there is no positive direction.<a name=477:12></a> Here the Spirit will guide us, sometimes by motives, love to others or practical righteousness; charity to a soul, or christian kindness, may make me take a long journey, but in all Christ must be the one motive.<a name=477:13></a> Then and then only the eye is single, and when not single is evil and requires attention or one may take human kindness for christian love.<a name=477:14></a> When the blessed Lord heard, "he whom thou lovest is sick," He abode two days in the same place.<a name=477:15></a> Then God's time and will, living there He went.<a name=477:16></a> God had allowed death to come in for His glory and Christ's!<a name=477:17></a>

		This connects obedience, and being thus led.<a name=477:18></a> In the days of scripture there were voices of the Spirit.<a name=477:19></a> I do not expect this, but it shews that in its nature it was not unscriptural, and I believe He will guide us and may suggest things to do, but the mind must be subject and lowly to enjoy this guidance, and if any man lack wisdom, let him ask of God who giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him.<a name=477:20></a> Such as are <i>meek</i>, them will He guide in judgment, them will He teach His way.<a name=477:21></a> But it will be in the spirit of obedience, not the acting of our own wills, however hidden the motive.<a name=477:22></a> The state of the heart and the word <i>hidden in it</i> is always in question here.<a name=477:23></a> The <i>word</i> forms the judgment in forming the state of the heart without perhaps a particular text being in the mind, and God is faithful not to suffer us to be tempted above that we are able.<a name=477:24></a>

		Christ must be the only motive.<a name=477:25></a> His Spirit and grace form our spirits, besides His being ostensibly to oneself the motive (Luke 9: 55, 56), and the motive and tone of heart do correct and guide us from deceiving ourselves.<a name=477:26></a> But in everything we should be led of the Spirit; this supposes true liberty in Christ and known salvation.<a name=477:27></a> The Holy Ghost first shews us the Father's love is a Spirit of adoption in us; next shews that we are in Christ and Christ in us, and sheds the love of God abroad in our hearts.<a name=477:28></a> Its fruits are love, joy, peace, then the walk, longsuffering, temperance, etc.<a name=477:29></a> Thus if living near to God He may specifically lead us to special efforts in which the life and spirit of Christ is displayed.<a name=477:30></a> But general precepts help to guide here.<a name=477:31></a> Let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath, etc.<a name=477:32></a> This will guide in any suggested service.<a name=477:33></a> The mere fact of intending Christ's glory, though right, is not enough.<a name=477:34></a> Is it what will glorify Him, not me?<a name=477:35></a> Paul was to preach to every creature under heaven, but at a given moment not in Mysia, nor Phrygia, not in Asia.<a name=477:36></a> A reading meeting is in a general way a most useful thing, and I do well to use it diligently as other things, but we have to seek.<a name=477:37></a> But while the one object is the first great thing for light, the principle of obedience must come in; if not self-will, that is, our own will, is a spring of action.<a name=477:38></a>

		MY DEAR BROTHER, -- Another word is used for death as to the saints falling asleep, otherwise, in reasoning on man's state, death is often spoken of.<a name=479:1></a> But death and going to heaven have mischievously taken the place of the Lord's coming and being like Him.<a name=479:2></a> Going to glory when we die is quite unscriptural.<a name=479:3></a> As to funerals, I would not go to any where the clerical system is kept up, I did not to my father's.<a name=479:4></a> If it gives offence, you cannot expect other than the offence of the cross.<a name=479:5></a> As to the age of infants, the statement you refer to is as to when conscience begins to work.<a name=479:6></a> I have no doubt that little children are saved.<a name=479:7></a> We cannot fix a date, for it varies with each.<a name=479:8></a> Matthew 18 seems to me quite clear.<a name=479:9></a>

		It is true that when justification and sanctification come together in scripture, sanctification comes first, because the Spirit of God sets a man apart to enjoy the efficacy of Christ's precious blood, and this is important because evangelical teaching sets justification as a kind of imperfect work, and that we were made meet afterwards for something higher.<a name=479:10></a> This is not scriptural, as the thief was fit to go and be with Christ.<a name=479:11></a> There is progress, or ought to be; little children, young men, fathers, growing up to Him who is the Head in all things, changed into the same image from glory to glory, and perfecting holiness in the fear of God.<a name=479:12></a> But as to acceptance, "As he is, so are we in this world.<a name=479:13></a>" By faith in Christ I am quickened, and that life is in itself a perfectly holy thing, and believing in Him and His work I am perfectly justified.<a name=479:14></a> The actual state I am in then comes in question, but as to my person I am set apart to God.<a name=479:15></a> As to an assembly meeting, it is when those who compose it meet as such in Christ's name.<a name=479:16></a> What Paul's heart was upon was first to possess Christ; that I may win Christ, then that he might have part in the first resurrection.<a name=479:17></a> He was running for these.<a name=479:18></a> Philippians, though based on it, never treats of a finished salvation, but of the race we run towards the glory, towards being like Christ.<a name=479:19></a>

		It is a mistake sometimes made, and the fear of a reproach and discredit arising from having a person who does not honour the gospel in our midst, leads the saints, who desire it may be honoured, in a false course.<a name=481:4></a> Righteousness, specially when connected with character and honour, is rigid and repulsive because it is afraid of itself and for itself.<a name=481:5></a> Grace which dwells in perfect righteousness being above the thought of self, because it is divine in its nature, and being secure in perfect righteousness within, is gracious in tone without, can think for others.<a name=481:6></a> Such was Christ.<a name=481:7></a> How perfect in all His ways and love.<a name=481:8></a> He had never to think nor did not think what the effect for Himself would be of His intercourse with sinners.<a name=481:9></a> He thought entirely of and for others.<a name=481:10></a> This is the effect of intrinsic holiness and grace.<a name=481:11></a> He was holy enough to have no thought of aught else, and thus to be the companion of sinners for their sakes to deliver them, regardless of self.<a name=481:12></a> Now the Christian ought to be able through grace to do this, only he has to be on his guard for himself.<a name=481:13></a> There is this difference that the church has to be jealous and watchful for the glory of Christ and the holiness of the walk of its members.<a name=481:14></a> Still, I am persuaded that were we nearer the Lord, more thoroughly identified ourselves in spirit and walk with Him in the security of His grace, there would be more capacity to seize the good grace had wrought in others and be above the evil, dealing with it to heal in grace.<a name=481:15></a> For this no doubt straight paths must be made for the feet.<a name=481:16></a>
