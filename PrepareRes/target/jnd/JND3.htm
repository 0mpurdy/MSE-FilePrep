		THE DOCTRINE OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND AT THE TIME OF THE REFORMATION, OF THE REFORMATION ITSELF, OF SCRIPTURE, AND OF THE CHURCH OF ROME, BRIEFLY COMPARED WITH THE REMARKS OF THE REGIUS PROFESSOR OF DIVINITY¦
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I shall first shortly state the reasons which induce me to take notice of, and comment on, the "Remarks" upon the sermon lately preached at St.<a name=1:1></a> Mary's.<a name=1:2></a> If the Regius Professor of Divinity had simply undertaken to refute the sermon preached at St.<a name=1:3></a> Mary's, to which his remarks apply, it might perhaps have been unbecoming, or at the least premature, for a third person to enter into the discussion, or do more than watch its progress.<a name=1:4></a> But this is expressly disclaimed, and a very different office is assumed.<a name=1:5></a> "I must now come," says the pamphlet referred to, "to the exposition of the gospel; and I trust that I shall not be thought unreasonable or presumptuous, if I say at once that I am not entering into controversy.<a name=1:6></a>" It is true the author professes, at the close of the "Remarks," "I am not entering into controversy, but am merely stating facts.<a name=1:7></a>" But for this purpose he has said a great deal too much.<a name=1:8></a> "When the doctrine of the Church is misrepresented," he continues, "and there is danger of young disciples being misled, I feel it my duty as a faithful soldier of Christ to stand between the dead and the living, and to stay the plague.<a name=1:9></a>"

		This itself were language a little strong for any supposed or real misrepresentation of the doctrines of the Church of England.<a name=1:10></a> But the author has indeed altogether said too much or too little.<a name=1:11></a> If he meant to confine himself to the vindication of the doctrines of the Church of England from misrepresentation, he has said too much.<a name=1:12></a> If he meant to tell us what was

		not or what was the gospel, he should have surely said a good deal more.<a name=2:1></a> But that I may not leave it uncertain how much these remarks call upon every one to satisfy themselves on the whole principles of their faith, I shall conclude the quotation already adverted to.<a name=2:2></a> "The sermon now before me professes to contain an exposition of that gospel which Jesus Christ delivered to His apostles; but in the name of Paul, of Cephas, and of Christ, I say that this is not the gospel.<a name=2:3></a>" In saying this, the Regius Professor has laid the solemn responsibility upon every one concerned about his own soul of enquiring what his faith is; and whether it be founded in truth, if at all similar to what is thus authoritatively pronounced to be not the gospel; (for, what is the gospel?<a name=2:4></a> is a question of individual salvation, which men must judge of responsibly); and, I will add, responsibility to judge of that proposed to be substituted in its place, and to see what conclusions it will lead us.<a name=2:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This is no vindication of the doctrines of the Church of England from misrepresentation, nor a mere statement of facts.<a name=2:6></a> It is, in good truth, a standing between the living and the dead, if the author be right.<a name=2:7></a> If the preacher be right, and I follow the author of the "Remarks," I am not, according to the former, in the way of salvation.<a name=2:8></a> If the author of the "Remarks" be right, in receiving the doctrine of the preacher I am departing from the gospel of Christ: I am not amongst the living but the dead.<a name=2:9></a> I am justified therefore in the fullest comment upon the evidence brought to sustain such a charge; and in enquiring what are the grounds on which I am here called upon to believe that this is a deadly contagion, in which the Church of England has no part; and how far the Regius Professor is warranted in bringing the views which he does in these "Remarks" bring forward in opposition to, and as contravening, what he says is not the gospel.<a name=2:10></a> I am not here concerned to defend the preacher: with him the author says he will not enter into controversy; and it is his part, if he see good, to defend himself.<a name=2:11></a> But the author of the "Remarks" has thrown the whole question open, and forced it upon the judgment of every one who is interested in what the gospel is; for he has raised a controversy for every soul.<a name=2:12></a> I shall leave therefore the sermon itself unnoticed, and discuss merely the statements made in the "Remarks," as bearing on the general subject.<a name=2:13></a>

		contained in the preface to the Articles, I am led by Archbishop Lawrence and the Regius Professor of Divinity to travel into the mind of Cranmer, through the vacillating opinions of Melancthon.<a name=3:1></a> Those opinions we can judge of, according to the testimony of the author of the "Remarks" himself, only by the help of dates, and we must be certain of getting a right edition, before we can know what was that mind which he held, and which therefore Cranmer held, and which therefore the Articles are to be supposed to hold.<a name=3:2></a> I there read, that a person "shall not put his own sense or comment" on the Article, "but shall take it in the literal and grammatical sense.<a name=3:3></a>" The authority of this document I do not pretend to state: whatever it be, of this I am sure, that Archbishop Lawrence's Bampton Lectures, especially the last two, are a very singular comment on it.<a name=3:4></a> For my own part, I soberly think Article XVII to be as wise, perhaps I might say the wisest and best condensed human statement of the views it contains that I am acquainted with.<a name=3:5></a> I am fully content to take it in its literal and grammatical sense.<a name=3:6></a> I believe that predestination to life is the eternal purpose of God, by which, before the foundations of the world were laid, He firmly decreed, by His counsel secret to us, to deliver from curse and destruction those whom He had chosen in Christ out of the human race, <i>and to bring them, through Christ, as vessels made to honour, to eternal salvation</i>.<a name=3:7></a> I believe therefore that those who are endued with so excellent a gift of God, are called according to His purpose working in due time; that they obey the calling through grace; that they are freely justified; that they are adopted to be children of God; that they are made conformed to the image of His only begotten Son Jesus Christ; that they do walk holily in good works; and that at length, through the mercy of God, they do attain to everlasting felicity.<a name=3:8></a> And, I might ask, does the author of the "Remarks" believe this?<a name=3:9></a> that is, believing as he does that the Church, that is, every baptized person, is predestinated and chosen, does he believe all this of every such person?<a name=3:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But as the historical enquiry has been started, I shall beg leave shortly to follow it, that we may, as far as a brief opportunity allows, investigate the grounds on which the author of the "Remarks" states, that the Lutheran Church was the source from which the Church of England derives her doctrine; and that Calvinism was "a contagion flowing from the close

		contact into which those who fled from the Marian persecution were brought with the Calvinistic doctrines.<a name=4:1></a>" And here I must remark, that it appears to me that the Regius Professor of Divinity puts the Church of England into a very discreditable position.<a name=4:2></a> Choice between Lutheran and Calvinistic she may be allowed to make.<a name=4:3></a> That she drew her doctrines originally from Scripture; that her founders were themselves taught of God, so as to be able to teach others, or lay the basis of the Church they were about to rear or reform on the stable foundations of the word of God, is in no case suggested or supposed.<a name=4:4></a> In fact, when we would ascertain her thoughts and her foundation, -- we are directed to Melancthon.<a name=4:5></a> In the Bampton Lectures of Archbishop Lawrence, there is not an expression on which he remarks, of which he does not discover the words and the source in some German reformer.<a name=4:6></a> For my own part I cannot believe this: and it would seem to me an ill way of securing confidence in her doctrine, to lead the minds of students to so mazy and uncertain a path to discover her meaning and ascertain the foundations of her authority (however it may suit those who put their "comment on the Articles," instead of searching the authority of Scripture for their plain and grammatical meaning).<a name=4:7></a> But let us ascertain some of the facts.<a name=4:8></a> Peter Martyr and Bucer were Regius Professors of Divinity at Oxford and Cambridge respectively during the reign of Edward VI.<a name=4:9></a> "Bucer," the author of the "Remarks," states, "died in 1551, when Calvin had scarcely begun to propagate his peculiar opinions respecting predestination.<a name=4:10></a> His first public controversy was in that year, and his first publication on the subject in 1552.<a name=4:11></a>" Let us now see what were the views of Bucer, the Regius Professor of Divinity at Cambridge.<a name=4:12></a> After stating some of the difficulties usually objected to what are called Calvinistic views, he thus writes:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"But those who wish simply to follow the word of God easily free themselves from these.<a name=4:13></a> For, first, they firmly rest in this: that God Himself testifies concerning Himself, that out of the race of man, ruined by its first parent, He chooses some to re-form them to a new and blessed life; and has, or esteems the rest as vessels of His wrath, in whom he should shew examples of His just vengeance; whereby He should commend to the elect His mercy, because He translates them, born to the same death, into the inheritance of the divine life.<a name=4:14></a> This judgment of the Lord concerning men, the Scripture

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		everywhere preaches and inculcates; as well in the history of the Lord's acts, as in the oracles themselves; for Cain was rejected; Abel elected.<a name=5:1></a> In the time of Noah all were destroyed by the flood save eight men: and of the sons of Noah, blessing came upon two, a curse upon the third .<a name=5:2></a>.<a name=5:3></a>.<a name=5:4></a> .<a name=5:5></a> And where do we not see, as in whole peoples, so in private men, and these otherwise most closely united, that some are taken, others rejected?<a name=5:6></a> From these examples, therefore, and oracles, witnessing clearly the same thing, of which Scripture is full (in which, namely, the difference which God puts between men is declared), the saints have the fullest persuasion, that, before the foundation of the world, some are elected to life, appointed also before their doing anything, to that to which God at length brings them, namely, that in them He should give an example of His wrath, and that in that way His name should be sanctified in them.<a name=5:7></a> And, when they see it thus to be pleasing in the sight of God, they render thanks with our Lord to God the Father for this very judgment, as well that He hides this mystery of salvation from the wise and prudent of this world, as that He reveals it to the elect little ones; however He may will that the revelation of the mystery should be equally offered to both.<a name=5:8></a> Thence, whereas God nevertheless commands the gospel to be preached to every creature, and to call them to the communion of the gospel, be they who they may; the saints do not dispute why it is God's command to call them, whom nevertheless He will not have to come, yea, whom He hardens lest they should come: but they thus judge; it is the Lord who commands, it is our part therefore to obey, and to account it sufficient that in the meanwhile we so far serve the Lord as to the reprobate, that every excuse of their wickedness should be taken away from them, and they should be obliged themselves to confess that God justly condemns them.<a name=5:9></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, "When we speak of God, we all understand the Author of every good; and he who affirms that any good is not effected by God, does not hesitate to deny that He is God.<a name=5:10></a> For if ever so little good be not from God, then is He not the effecter of every good; therefore neither is He God.<a name=5:11></a> But, when these preposterous patrons of divine justice say, that all men are alike called by the gospel, and that like grace is offered and bestowed upon all, that they may follow, God calling them, and that men's embracing this grace of God is in their power, we will ask them, Whence is it that some, making good use of
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=6>[Page 6]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		their power, embrace the grace equally offered to all -- that some reject it, making bad use of their power?<a name=6:1></a> If they say, That is from man, not from God; now the chief good from which all the rest hang, the embracing the offered favour of God, is from man; and man has that which he has not received, nor is God now the effecter of every good; therefore neither is He God.<a name=6:2></a> This conflicts not only, as I have said, with Scripture, but also with common sense.<a name=6:3></a> But if it be from God that any one hears effectually and fallows God's calling, then in any case God does not give His grace to all equally.<a name=6:4></a> For to those who follow the call of the gospel He gives that very thing which He does not give to those who reject the gospel.<a name=6:5></a> It remains, therefore, as yet and always, that human reason is condemned in the judgment of God, if you permit it to judge about God, the judge of all.<a name=6:6></a> If therefore in practice it comes to this concerning the whole dispensation of our salvation, it is not wonderful if it happens, in that it so seemed good to God, that all mortals should be alike called by the gospel, although He may not wish that all should follow that calling: for many are called, few chosen.<a name=6:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"The saints therefore will ingenuously confess, yea and will preach, that God wills that the gospel indeed should be preached to all, and that thereby all mortals should be called to life; but that He does not will that all should believe the gospel, for neither does He bestow that on all, but hardens many, lest they should bear to hear it.<a name=6:8></a> It comes indeed, as He Himself says, to many unto judgment: and Paul teaches, that the gospel, which in itself is a power unto salvation unto all, is a savour of death unto death to them who perish.<a name=6:9></a> In that is fulfilled, that, 'Hearing, hear ye, and understand not; seeing, see ye, and perceive not.<a name=6:10></a>' When the blessed Paul preached Christ to all the elders of the Jews at Rome, undoubtedly he did it the Lord willing and commanding it: yet when many did not believe, he himself testified that the prophecy of Isaiah was fulfilled in them: 'Hearing, hear ye,' etc.<a name=6:11></a> God therefore willed that they should be called by the gospel, and yet should not come.<a name=6:12></a> So when Joab," etc.<a name=6:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He then enumerates other similar instances.<a name=6:14></a> "This, therefore is the method of God; thus it seems good to Himself, that all indeed should be called to Him by the eternal word, but not to draw all to Him by His Spirit; but howbeit that those who are not drawn cannot come to Him; nevertheless,

		"Philip Melancthon," he says, "is accustomed to say<a href="#7:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> that man had a free will in the affairs of civil life, but not in the affairs of the life which God approves.<a name=7:2></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again: "For it is certain that any one's obeying the call of God, which is the beginning of our whole salvation, is the gift and work of God, which God bestows on some, denies to others.<a name=7:3></a> For these He persuades that He may effectually influence, those not so; and these whom he effectually influences cannot but follow, and those cannot follow whom He does not effectually influence.<a name=7:4></a> He wills therefore altogether that some should hear, and hear effectually; some hear and despise.<a name=7:5></a> But why God so wills and does, blessed Augustine has only two things to answer: O the depth of the riches!<a name=7:6></a> and, Is there unrighteousness with God?<a name=7:7></a> adding, to whomsoever this answer is displeasing, let him seek more learned persons, but let him take care lest he find presumptuous ones: De Sp.<a name=7:8></a> et Lit.<a name=7:9></a> c.<a name=7:10></a> 34.<a name=7:11></a> Nor will those who are truly pious answer anything else.<a name=7:12></a>" Bucer on <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#9">Romans  9</a>.<a name=7:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the same commentary on the Romans, he confutes the presciential or Arminian notion of election, quoting Augustine writing against the Pelagians, against Origen and Ambrose: saying, You say, not of present but of future works -- that of future works Jacob was loved; but you contradict the apostle, saying, Not of works that it might be by grace, etc.<a name=7:14></a>; bringing also the evidence of an infant dying after baptism to shew that it could not be in prescience of future works.<a name=7:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		On <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>.<a name=7:16></a> "For the apostle in this place is occupied with teaching, that God destined us to salvation before we were, not merely before we had done anything good: and from this he sets about to prove, that this will of God concerning our salvation was certain and unmoved, which no creature could turn aside: as that which God draws from Himself and His own goodness, which cannot be changed; and without any respect to our merit which varies so miserably .<a name=7:17></a>.<a name=7:18></a>.<a name=7:19></a> .<a name=7:20></a> Therefore .<a name=7:21></a>.<a name=7:22></a>.<a name=7:23></a> praefinition, which we commonly call predestination, is that designation of God, by which He marks out with Himself, and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Hence also is the predestination of the bad.<a name=8:4></a> For, as God also forms these out of nothing, so He forms them to some certain end: for He does all things wisely, without any exception, even to the predetermined and good use of the evil.<a name=8:5></a> Also the impious are organs and instruments of God, as below, chapter 9.<a name=8:6></a> God made all things for Himself, the wicked also for the day of evil.<a name=8:7></a> But this theologians do not bear to call predestination, but they call it reprobation: but God does everything well and wisely.<a name=8:8></a> Therefore also everything has a determined end" (<i>nihil non destinatum</i>).<a name=8:9></a> After adducing instances he proceeds:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"But whereas God formed these and all other wicked men, who will deny, that He knew, before He formed them, to what He willed to use them; and that He then ordained and destined them to this?<a name=8:10></a> What therefore forbids us to say that there is a predestination of these also?<a name=8:11></a>"

		Again on <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1">Ephesians  1</a>.<a name=8:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"The term election is used in two ways: sometimes for election to some external office, as 'Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?<a name=8:13></a>' Judas the traitor was elected indeed to the apostleship; but to the inheritance of eternal life he was not elected.<a name=8:14></a> Again, election sometimes means a designation of some men, out of the common lost mass, to the knowledge of the will of God, and at length to eternal life, of the mere favour of God; and it is of that election the discourse here is, and of that Christ also speaks, 'I know whom I.<a name=8:15></a> have chosen.<a name=8:16></a>'
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"On the whole, election is the mere gift of God, and therefore favour, and not reward.<a name=8:17></a> Read Augustine; he certainly has the clearest and most evident testimonies.<a name=8:18></a> Election, therefore, is the destination and certain commiseration from eternity, before the world was constituted, by which God separated, from the universal race of lost men, those whom He was pleased to pity, to eternal life, out of His purely free mercy, before they could do anything good or bad.<a name=8:19></a> It is certain, I

		"And the words of the Holy Ghost are plain by which He ascribes the hardness of heart, the dullness of ears, the blindness of eyes, in Pharaoh, and therefore in all like him, not to the flesh, or the devil, but to God Himself, who owes no man anything, and does everything most justly.<a name=9:2></a> If, therefore, any one object, If nothing is done on the part of men, in what relates to election, which concurs with the divine work, God seems to be unjust, that He does not give the same reward to all: he is to be answered, There is nothing similar between God's thoughts and ours.<a name=9:3></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence we may estimate the value of the quotation of Dr.<a name=9:4></a> Lawrence<a href="#9:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> from Bucer, appended to his own views of the subject.<a name=9:5></a> "He who doubts about this (namely, about predestination), cannot believe himself to be called and justified, that is, cannot be a Christian.<a name=9:6></a> It is to be assumed, therefore, as a first principle of faith, that we all are foreknown, foredetermined, and separated from the rest, and selected for this, that we should be eternally saved; and that this purpose of God cannot be changed.<a name=9:7></a>"

		This Bucer was a man highly esteemed for his moderation and powers, and, having long resided at Strasbourg, was therefore invited over to assist in settling the Reformation in England, and was accordingly appointed Professor of Divinity at Cambridge.<a name=9:9></a> He had a very important share in the settlement of the English Liturgy, which was translated into Latin on purpose that he might revise, give his opinion and corrections; and many and material alterations were made accordingly at his suggestion and by his advice.<a name=9:10></a> In fact, this may be said to have been the formation of the Liturgy, or Book of Common Prayer: and from its validity the whole validity of the English succession hangs.<a name=9:11></a> For King Edward's first book was in truth (what King James was pleased, while a Scotch king, to designate

		One circumstance or two more may be mentioned to shew the estimation of Bucer, and, if need be, his intimate connection with Cranmer.<a name=10:5></a> It was by Cranmer he was invited into England: and, receiving triple the usual stipend during his life at Cambridge, he was buried in the University Church, the vice-chancellor ordering the members of all the colleges to attend his funeral.<a name=10:6></a>

		After much reasoning and scholastic discussion, in which, as Bucer, he says, "But since God does all things with a destined purpose, nothing by chance or fortuitously, beyond doubt whatever He creates and makes, He destines to some end and use.<a name=12:4></a> In this respect neither the impious, nor the devil himself, nor sins, can be excluded from predestination.<a name=12:5></a>" Then distinguishing, however, between the predestination of saints, as Bucer did, and what he says is more properly called reprobation, he thus defines them:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"I say, therefore, predestination is the most wise purpose of God, by which before all eternity He fixedly decreed, to call those whom He loved in Christ to the adoption of sons, to justification by faith, and at length to glory by good works, whereby they might be conformed to the image of the Son of God; and that in them might be declared the glory and mercy of the Creator.<a name=12:6></a>" "Purpose," he says, includes "will.<a name=12:7></a>" "But this will we ought to understand to be that efficacious will which they call of a consequence, i.<a name=12:8></a>e.<a name=12:9></a>, producing a consequence: by which is caused that the predestination of God should not be frustrated.<a name=12:10></a>" "By which He fixedly decreed.<a name=12:11></a>" "By these words we are taught that the predestination of God is immutable.<a name=12:12></a> For Paul says, in 2 Timothy, "The foundation standeth sure; the Lord knows those who are His"; and he quotes from the well-known conclusion of <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>; <a href="../bible/James.htm#1:17">James  1:17</a>; Isaiah, "I am God; I change not"; and Paul, "The gifts and calling of God are without repentance.<a name=12:13></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		Again: "There is ambiguity in that word <i>for</i> (Propter), how it is to be understood.<a name=13:6></a> For if good works are understood, as in truth they are, and are done because God predestinated us to this end, that we should live rightly (as the epistle to the Ephesians has it, to wit, that we are elect, that we should be holy, without blame before Him, and that God prepared good works that we should walk in them), as to this opinion, the proposition is to be affirmed.<a name=13:7></a> But if that word <i>for</i>, is to be referred to the efficient cause, as if good works, which God foresaw we were about to do, were as merits and causes which could move God that He should predestinate us, this sense we admit in no way .<a name=13:8></a>.<a name=13:9></a>.<a name=13:10></a> .<a name=13:11></a> For vocation, which is the effect of predestination, is the cause why we should be justified: justification is the cause of good works: and good works, although they be not the cause, are yet the means by which God leads us to eternal life.<a name=13:12></a> But none of them is the cause or the means why we should be elected by God; as, on the other hand, sins are the cause indeed why we are damned, not however why we are reprobated by God.<a name=13:13></a> For if they were the causes of reprobation, no one could be elected; for the condition of all is alike, for we are all born in sin .<a name=13:14></a>.<a name=13:15></a>.<a name=13:16></a> .<a name=13:17></a> These things being now thus settled, reasons are to be given, on account of which we deny that foreseen good works are the causes of our predestination.<a name=13:18></a>"

		He then argues, that justification would be of works if election depended on foreseen works; and that good works are the effect of predestination; and that if we were predestinated for foreseen works, Paul's exclamation about it would be nonsense.<a name=13:19></a> And he reasons, that foreseen works could be no such moving cause, from the cases of Tyre and Sidon, when God did foresee and did not spare.<a name=13:20></a> Then, again: "For

		He says, "We in no way say that grace is common to all, but that it is granted to some, and to others by the will of God it is not given": and he reasons, that it is theirs only that are drawn, and peculiar to them; and declares it absurd to reason that all are drawn, and some will not come," etc.<a name=14:10></a> That sufficient grace is not given to all -- that Tyre and Sidon had not what was sufficient -- that external vocation is common to predestinated and reprobate; and that thereby God does not mock them with general promises, but their damnation is rendered just.<a name=14:11></a> That all have not power to become the sons of God, but those who are born of the will of God, and that Christ is to be said to have died for all, "sufficiently, but not efficaciously.<a name=14:12></a>" That the reprobate subserve the divine purpose, to illustrate and declare the power of His sincerity; that the reprobate can do many good works to a certain extent, and, on the other hand, the predestinate fall into the grossest sins; instincing Saul, Solomon (who he seems to think fell away, "lapsus est, imo defecit"), Ahab, Joash, and quoting Ezekiel; and, on the other hand, David, Moses, Aaron: and that good works "sometimes subserve predestination, sometimes reprobation.<a name=14:13></a> Predestination through them brings the elect to life; and as to reprobation, they are sometimes reasons why the fall is made more terrible.<a name=14:14></a>" .<a name=14:15></a>.<a name=14:16></a>.<a name=14:17></a> "Sins also tend as to reprobation, so to predestination.<a name=14:18></a> For those who are reprobate, by them are drawn to eternal ruin.<a name=14:19></a> Those who are predestinate, through them illustrate the glory of God, when they are snatched out of them.<a name=14:20></a>"

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		After reasoning against its connection with works actual or prospective, he says, "But it is worth while to see how they get on when they say, on the one hand, that hope is a certain expectation; on the other, however, that it is a most firm dogma, that none can be certain of his salvation, unless it shall have been individually revealed to him by God.<a name=16:4></a> Here they feel themselves at a loss: they confess that it is difficult to see how that is certainty of hope.<a name=16:5></a> Here they miserably fret themselves, sweat, and use many glosses.<a name=16:6></a> First, they determine .<a name=16:7></a>.<a name=16:8></a>.<a name=16:9></a> that certainty of hope which flows from certainty of faith .<a name=16:10></a>.<a name=16:11></a>.<a name=16:12></a> .<a name=16:13></a> But they go farther, and say, that we by faith believe generally and absolutely that all the elect and predestinated will be saved, but that hope causes us to trust that we are of the number of the elect: as if hope had a particular knowledge subordinate to faith: that what had been generally comprehended through faith, should be separately applied to us through hope .<a name=16:14></a>.<a name=16:15></a>.<a name=16:16></a> lastly, they conclude, that the certainty of hope is less than that of faith: we on the contrary make the certainty of both equal.<a name=16:17></a> As much faith as we have, so much also we have of hope, for neither does faith retain any certainty for itself which it does not transmit to hope .<a name=16:18></a>.<a name=16:19></a>.<a name=16:20></a> .<a name=16:21></a> But they seem to me to do as those who, when they defend a city in a siege, diligently shut and fortify all the rest of the gates, but in the meanwhile leave one open, by which when the enemies enter and plunder everything, they may perceive that they have lost their labour; so they indeed labour extremely, lest there should seem to be any uncertainty arising from the goodness, power, and clemency of God, or the merit of Christ.<a name=16:22></a> Yet in the meanwhile they determine our will to be so liable to change, that no man can or ought to promise himself perseverance, even from the word of God: and so wholly take away all certainty, that the saying of Paul can have no place, 'Hope maketh not ashamed'; nor can the certainty, which they endeavour to establish, be of any profit.<a name=16:23></a> Indeed, if we consult the sacred scriptures, we shall understand that God is not only generally good and powerful,

		But the author of the "Remarks" cannot but have been aware that the doctrine of assurance, as directly connected with consequentially, I will not say as being, as some hold, justifying faith, but that the doctrine of assurance in fact is taught, not only in the confession of the reformed churches in France, but also in that of Augsburg.<a name=24:1></a> I certainly should have stated the confession of the French churches to have been a much more formed and material document.<a name=24:2></a> This, however, of course, is matter of judgment.<a name=24:3></a> In this point the confession of Augsburg is as decided as possible; and this is material, as shewing, not merely the fact of its being taught in the church, but that it was one of the points on which, as essential to Christian truth, they separated from the apostate church of Rome: as if, as the council of Trent expresses it, "to doubt of it were to doubt of the promises of God, and the efficacy of Christ's death and resurrection.<a name=24:4></a>" That the soul of a saint may be disturbed, as Peter Martyr says, we admit; but to make doubts which arise from the flesh and the corruption of our nature, the state in which a Christian ought to be, or the justifiable standard of the frame of his mind, is to make unbelief the rule of faith, to deny the power of Christ's atonement as received by faith, and to affirm the propriety of disbelief in its efficacy and in God's promises, or that being justified by faith we <i>have</i> peace with God.<a name=24:5></a> But we must not pass yet quite away from history.<a name=24:6></a> As to this appropriating character of faith, and consequently the connection of the sense of salvation with justification, we may quote what the author of the "Remarks" has already recognized as sound doctrine.<a name=24:7></a> He has commented much on, and indeed spoken of it as a leading error, the confounding of justification and salvation; but he is charging here not the preacher, but the reformers, nay, rather, the authorized formularies of the Church.<a name=24:8></a> "As is more fully declared in the homily of justification," is the language of the Articles.<a name=24:9></a> And where is this homily to be found?<a name=24:10></a> I suppose the author of the "Remarks" will not deny that it is the homily in three parts, entitled the homily of salvation.<a name=24:11></a> The homily of salvation is in fact a full treatise on justification: but I shall quote a passage from the third part, as evidence of their view, and also of the author of the "Remarks.<a name=24:12></a>" "These articles of our faith the devils believe, and so they believe all things that be written in the New and Old Testament to be true: and yet for all this faith they be but devils, remaining still in their

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And proving that profession with ungodliness cannot have this assurance, they reason: "For how can a man have this true faith, this sure trust and confidence in God, that by the merits of Christ his sins be forgiven, and he reconciled to the favour of God, and to be partaker of the kingdom of heaven by Christ, when he liveth ungodly?<a name=25:3></a>" Well, the author of the "Remarks" says now: "I dare not in this life count myself to have apprehended, or pronounce my sins to be forgiven.<a name=25:4></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I quote it now as evidence of the way in which the homilies identify salvation with justification (for they use them as identical terms, or rather assume, that in proving justification they were proving salvation), and how a true faith is made by them to consist in the confidence in God's promises, that our sins are forgiven, and that we shall be partakers of the kingdom of heaven by Christ, and that both are at once concluded by faith.<a name=25:5></a>

		Farther, as to the historic evidence of the alleged Lutheranism of the Church of England reformation, we may remark, that, when the persecuted English Protestants fled to Germany on the accession of Mary, the Lutherans would not receive them into their cities at all; this was rather singular evidence of the Lutheran character of their views.<a name=25:6></a> It is evidence of this, that so far from the contagion being merely brought back, they were in the full Calvinistic disease before they left England.<a name=25:7></a> I am quite aware that the sacrament question was connected with this.<a name=25:8></a> But what other substantial difference was there?<a name=25:9></a> For example, what was the point on which the two parties of the Reformation finally split at the conferences at Marburg?<a name=25:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Farther, an evidence of the estimation in which the Lutherans held the English reformers, we may quote Melancthon, quoted in a note to Mosheim: "Some vociferate that the English martyrs are martyrs of the devil.<a name=25:11></a> I am unwilling thus to insult the Holy Spirit in Latimer, who has past his eightieth year, and in other holy men whom I knew.<a name=25:12></a>" Note in Maclaine's Mosheim, volume iv, page 383.<a name=25:13></a> [Cent.<a name=25:14></a> XVI, section iii, part ii, chapter 2, xvii.<a name=25:15></a>]

		But as the Lutheran Church has been referred to and as we have been told that "the Loci Theologici of Melancthon in any edition after 1545 may be taken as speaking the sentiments of all the Lutheran divines," and the Church of England views are attempted to be rested on this basis; it may be worth our while to advert to the history of the Lutheran Church briefly.<a name=26:2></a> It is not perhaps astonishing, though it might seem odd, that the author of the "Remarks" has never once adverted to Luther as having anything to say to the opinions of the Lutheran Church.<a name=26:3></a> It would indeed have destroyed all the groundwork upon which the argument that the Church of England was Lutheran rested, and its object too: still we must be allowed to refer to them in considering the Lutheran Church.<a name=26:4></a> It is well known that one of Luther's principal and most laboured works was on the bondage of the will -- its absolute and unqualified incapability of doing anything but sin.<a name=26:5></a> I shall confine myself to two quotations, exhibitory of his views: merely mentioning, that it is stated by historians, that declarations of Luther were extant, written many years after, in which he stated, that this and his catechism were the only things on review in which he could feel thoroughly satisfied.<a name=26:6></a> He thus writes: "It is a granted<a href="#26:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> position that free-will in all, is alike defined to be, that which cannot will good.<a name=26:7></a>" "And indeed if it were not so, God could not elect any one, nor would there be any place for election, but for free-will only, as choosing or refusing the long-suffering and anger of God.<a name=26:8></a> And if God be thus robbed of His power and wisdom to elect, what will there be remaining but that idol fortune, under the name of which all things take place at random?<a name=26:9></a> Nay, we shall at length come to this; that men may be saved and damned without God's knowing anything at all about it, as not having determined by certain election who should be saved or who should be damned; but having set before all men in general His pardoning goodness<a href="#26:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a> and long-suffering, and His mercy,

		For my own part, I cannot discern one single jot of difference on this head between the statement of the author of the "Remarks," and the doctrine of the Church of Rome.<a name=30:3></a> The Church of Rome held, that righteousness could not be imputed without faith, as well as the author of the "Remarks.<a name=30:4></a>" The Church of Rome held, that "it were necessary to believe that no sins are, or ever were, remitted, save freely by the divine mercy on account of Christ," and that "no pious person ought to doubt of the merit of Christ's death," as well as the author of the "Remarks.<a name=30:5></a>" The Church of Rome held, and does hold, that past sin is put away in baptism, only a little more clearly stated than by the author of the "Remarks," that is, original sin in infants, or actual also in adults: so that a person is therein called, pardoned, accepted in Christ; while subsequent evil was to be put away by subsequent repentance.<a name=30:6></a> They hold the necessity of good works, and the freedom of the will, as well as the author of the "Remarks.<a name=30:7></a>" But what they did not hold, and what the author of the "Remarks" does not hold, was, such a reception of the value of Christ's death by faith as gives peace and assurance of conscience, so that "gloriemur confidentissime," as a former Professor of Divinity at Oxford expresses it: which the reformers <i>did</i> hold, <i>did</i> preach, and <i>did</i> profess; and that so universally as to be made a special matter of condemnation as their opinion at the council of Trent.<a name=30:8></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the inconsistency of those who speak of these things from theory, without any acquaintance with men's conscience (though it is there <i>generally</i> that the utter folly of their notions comes out to light), was never more glaringly manifested than in these "Remarks.<a name=33:14></a>" We are told in one page, that every baptized person feels assured that he is pardoned; but in the next, the author says, "I dare not say my sins are forgiven.<a name=33:15></a>" I suppose the author is not a baptized person; or if he tells me, Yes, but I may have committed sins since I was baptized, then I suppose he felt assured he was pardoned when he was an infant, and felt nothing at all; or at any rate it results, that every baptized persons' feeling assured that he is pardoned comes to this, that nobody does in point of fact.<a name=33:16></a> There was peace preached by Jesus Christ, and the atonement of Christ

		But sin is a thing which affects the conscience when a man thinks: and it is only the direct exercise of faith in the blood of the atonement, which can give knowledge of actual forgiveness, which purges the conscience from dead works to serve the living God.<a name=34:3></a> And here consequently is the association of salvation with it; because the redeeming love of God is personally known, the Spirit witnessing with our spirit that we are the children of God.<a name=34:4></a> And hence persons holding these general views can go along with the world as others, because they have never personally come to God.<a name=34:5></a> And, I add, its thoroughly Antinomian tendency cannot be too strongly pressed; because what is it that is to be got over in man?<a name=34:6></a> The enmity of his heart against God; the carnal mind, which is enmity with God; and the friendship of the world, which is enmity with God.<a name=34:7></a> But how is the enmity of the natural heart to be got over but by bringing in love?<a name=34:8></a> And how?<a name=34:9></a> By knowing that "he loved us.<a name=34:10></a>" And how shall we know this?<a name=34:11></a> but "hereby know we love, because he laid down his life for us.<a name=34:12></a>" For observe now, the enmity is a real thing, and the love must be a real thing: as Paul expresses it, "by whom we have now received the reconciliation" (or, if you please, "atonement"): and to be produced it must be by practically knowing "he first loved us," which is known by the value of Christ's death received by faith, and the Father's love as manifested in it.<a name=34:13></a> If I rest in a pardon received in baptism, I can feel assured that I am pardoned without ever personally coming to God in my conscience, which is the root and essence of Antinomianism; whereas if it hang on the exercise of personal faith in Him, this brings me directly into His presence and subjection.<a name=34:14></a> But if I now exercise faith in Christ's death as an atonement and reconciliation, now that I am writing this; I must believe that my sins are everlastingly forgiven and rejoice in the Father's favour, or I do not believe in the efficacy of Christ's death, or the Father's manifested love therein.<a name=34:15></a>

		But there is one other sentence to which (as exhibiting the inconsistency of these views in the light of the Scripture, and how little they flow from this as opened to us by the Spirit of God) I must advert: "It is a mistake to say, that a free gift excludes conditions; on the contrary, the very nature of a covenant implies conditions.<a name=41:4></a>" If one merely had to cavil in argument, one might reason on this as as extraordinary a sentence as could be written; but I must go a little deeper.<a name=41:5></a> Take it on the surface, and the argument is simply nothing, and the expression "on the contrary" makes it almost ridiculous.<a name=41:6></a> But if we are to assume that there is a latent idea which takes away the absurdity, namely, that the free gift of the gospel is a covenant; then I say, that the argument flows from a direct contravention or ignorance of the whole statement of Scripture on the subject.<a name=41:7></a> In the first place, the argument proceeds on there being a covenant with man.<a name=41:8></a> There is no such thing in Scripture.<a name=41:9></a> You may call the law on Adam one, if you please, by which he fell (though I think incorrectly).<a name=41:10></a> And the covenant which God made with Abraham, and confirmed to Christ, has no conditions: and the difference of this as a pure promise is at length argued by the apostle on this very ground, to wit, that there was no second party but as a receiver, as contrasted with the one at Sinai; and therefore simply received by faith, which believes in a thing done by someone else.<a name=41:11></a>

		THE COVENANTS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The covenant is a word common in the language of a large class of Christian professors, and also of many true Christians; but in its development and detail, as to its unfolded principles, much obscurity appears to me to have arisen from a want of simple attention to Scripture.<a name=44:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The giving of the Church to Christ before the worlds, and the consequent giving to us of the blessings therein involved, seem to me indeed to be most clearly declared in Scripture, as in <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#1:9">2 Timothy  1:9</a>, 10.<a name=44:2></a> But little heed seems to have been given to that which is really contained in this covenant, as administered in dispensation, in its connection with the character and hope of the Church.<a name=44:3></a> Without weakening, then, the foundation whereon all rests, or pulling stones out of it to polish or carve for less needful and appropriate uses, while that whereon they should rest is gone, let us see the plain revelation afforded by the blessed word, on what, in their great branches, the covenants are founded.<a name=44:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The mystery of God's will, according to His good pleasure, which He hath purposed in Himself, He hath made known unto us; even that He should gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth, even in Him.<a name=44:5></a> This (however consistent everything was with it, or even typical of it) was hidden from ages and from generations.<a name=44:6></a> In fact, however progressive the intimations might be (better hopes sustaining believers in greater darkness, as was the case in prophecy), the limits of the actual dealings of God, as to dispensation, were narrowed, and the terms of them lowered with the falling condition of man and that growing darkness.<a name=44:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The promise that the seed of the woman should bruise the serpent's head, had a wider scope and was a more comprehensive promise, than was any subsequent revelation of resulting details, in the sphere subject to his power; it took the character of the work higher up.<a name=44:8></a> "For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.<a name=44:9></a>" The call and the promise to Abram again had a wider and a fuller meaning and purpose than any dealings with the Jews, not only at Mount Sinai, but even the previous deliverances which constituted them a nation -- a people marked by God as the favoured subjects of His strong hand and mighty arm, however more immediate and manifest the hand of God might

		be.<a name=45:1></a> It had therefore a more immediate and determinate object; not the out-reaching prospect of faith, but the visible actings towards the subjects of present deliverance.<a name=45:2></a> The law, given from Mount Sinai, took entirely another ground; and whatever was contained in it (as a figure for the time then present) was based upon the obedience of man, as to its terms of promise and blessing, and not in the supremacy of God, however flowing from it.<a name=45:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we turn to the song of Moses, and the song of the Lamb, we shall see at once the characteristic difference (even in the subjects of praise) in the dispensations.<a name=45:4></a> The whole song of Moses, most beautiful as it is, is about the hand and power of God doing wonders.<a name=45:5></a> "Thy right hand, O Lord, is become glorious in power.<a name=45:6></a>" So in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#15">Revelation  15</a>, "Great and marvellous are thy <i>works</i>, O Lord God Almighty.<a name=45:7></a>" The song of the Lamb is, "Just and true are thy <i>ways</i>, thou King of saints.<a name=45:8></a>"<a href="#45:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> We have the mind of Christ; and as Christ is the wisdom of God, and the power of God, so is made known by the Church the manifold wisdom of God; and so in the resurrection, when the Lord returns, shall in the Church also be manifested the power of God in Christ, "according to the working of his mighty power, whereby he is able to subdue even all things unto himself.<a name=45:9></a>" And then, in <i>fact</i> (as now known by <i>faith</i>) being indeed quickened, shall be manifested "the exceeding greatness of his power to usward who believe; according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in heavenly places.<a name=45:10></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But now let the Church learn, and let the saint learn that, if it looks with marvel and admiration at the deliverance wrought by the right hand of the Lord at the Red Sea, it too shall ere long sing even in higher and more blessed strains; but now it has a more intimate and distinct lesson to learn -- a peculiar, a privileged lesson -- the ways of God, the mind of God; and therefore it must be content to suffer.<a name=45:11></a> It is not the time, properly speaking, for power to be exercised in its behalf, but for "being renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him.<a name=45:12></a>" Now in this there is often found in us that which savours not of the wisdom of the holy and graceful

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I would enquire in how far the covenants unfold these things.<a name=47:7></a> The Abrahamic covenants (though wider in the scope and testimony, as we have seen, than the local blessings and promises to Israel, as the apostle also so fully argues) contained none of these things.<a name=47:8></a> They proposed the person of the Redeemer, the promised Seed; they proposed the blessing of all nations, but they went not beyond Abraham's being the heir of the world.<a name=47:9></a> This may disclose brighter things now that the veil is rent; but in the promises and covenants given to Abraham, he did not outstep as yet in expression the limits of what belonged to the first Adam, because the second Adam (who was also the Lord from heaven) was not revealed, and was simply testified of as the seed of Abraham in whom this blessing should come, whatever it was.<a name=47:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 15 we have the promise of a seed, numerous as the stars of heaven, and (after stating the circumstances in which they would be intermediately placed) the giving of the land to them, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates, confirmed by the covenant of the Lord passing between the pieces of the victims.<a name=48:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 17 this is established as an everlasting covenant with Abraham (his name being changed), and with his seed after him, throughout their generations -- that God would be a God to him, and to his seed after him; and that He would give to him, and to his seed after him, all the land wherein he was a stranger, for an everlasting possession; and that He would be their God.<a name=48:4></a> And circumcision was given to Abraham as a seal.<a name=48:5></a>

		We then come to Mount Sinai -- the first covenant made with Israel as a nation.<a name=49:3></a> And here, as the covenant was of course confined to the nation or literal seed recently delivered, so the subject matter of the promises was honour and blessing before that God whose all the earth was.<a name=49:4></a> This was the old covenant, as we afterwards read of the new covenant, which latter implies (as expressed in its terms) that it was made with the same people: both (whatever their character) dealing with them as a people -- i.<a name=49:5></a>e.<a name=49:6></a>, in reference to earth, although putting them as on earth into relationship to God.<a name=49:7></a> The new covenant (however its terms then might introduce new principles applicable to strangers) could not be said to be "not according to the covenant I made with their fathers, in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt," were it not a covenant made with Israel -- the same people with whom the former covenant was made at Mount Sinai.<a name=49:8></a> Whoever will but examine <a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#31">Jeremiah  31</a>, from which this very important testimony is quoted, will at once see that the new covenant is to, and with, Israel; as moreover it is not quoted by the apostle in any epistle except that to the Hebrews.<a name=49:9></a>

		The first covenant had ordinances of divine service, a holy order.<a name=51:1></a> It is remarkable to observe here that, coincident with the failure of man under natural principles, there arose the testimony of another foundation, and other and gracious ordinances of divine life.<a name=51:2></a> When I say coincident with the failure, I mean rather with the exhibition and evidence of the failure; and then is seen the evidence of the scheme of grace.<a name=51:3></a> Progressively had the character of the connection between God and man lowered, and progressively had man sunk to the hopeless state of having a broken law, a rejected God of glory, whose hand had been itself shewn in their favour as a covenant God.<a name=51:4></a> But as the natural portion of man was thus evidenced to be hopeless, the dawn immediately arose with coincident and answering clearness of that work and order of grace on which the divine purpose and mercy could stand.<a name=51:5></a>

		The covenant of Israel at Mount Sinai at once contained the proof that the obedience of man was a hopeless ground, under any circumstances, for relationship with God to rest upon; and it also contained the complete typical development of that on which it surely would and could rest -- on which comfort and peace and divine blessing could refresh the heart of man, weary with his own way; and this is the use which the apostle makes of it.<a name=51:6></a> It is not, Behold here the effects of the new covenant on earth; but the old covenant is a defective, faulty covenant.<a name=51:7></a> But the foundation of the new has been laid in the blood of the Mediator.<a name=51:8></a> It is not to us that the terms of the covenant, quoted from Jeremiah by the apostle, have been fulfilled, or that we are Israel and Judah; but that while the covenant is founded, not upon the obedience of a living people (to whom the blessing thereupon was to come, and the blood of a victim shed by a living mediator) but upon the obedience unto death of the Mediator Himself, on which (as its secure, unalterable foundation of grace) the covenant is founded.<a name=51:9></a>

		But, as we have seen, in the very act of forming the covenant, that the obedience of sinful man as its foundation was evinced to come to failure, and that therefore it carried with it, in the good mercy of our God, the testimony of another and a stable foundation; so did it also of the place into which we were to be brought by it.<a name=51:10></a> The holy order which accompanied the covenant (or which the covenant had) was the type of heavenly things.<a name=51:11></a> It was not "the days come in the which

One insuperable objection to taking these two verses as maintaining, like the rest, the reference to "covenant" is that the Greek work cannot mean covenanting victim, but one who disposed things (i.e. a "testator"). The death of the covenanter is in no way an axiomatic necessity; whereas the condition of men being dead is essential to bring a testament into operation.

		REMARKS ON LIGHT AND CONSCIENCE¦
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Allow me to say a few words on a very simple principle, connected with the exercise of men's hearts before the Lord, and with questions which are now occupying the thoughts and anxieties of a body of persons, who must at present be the object of the deepest interest to any real Christian, even if not within the reach of those kindly affections by which so many are united to them.<a name=57:1></a> It does not appear to me that, in the agitation which the introduction of long neglected truths has produced among them, any body of Christians has presented an adequate or satisfactory exhibition of Christian truth and practice; nor has anything more struck me as to the extreme defectiveness of the views of the most noted Christian teachers at present before the world, than this manifest failure.<a name=57:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am not about to enter into diffuse reasonings, but present a few considerations for their thoughts and consciences.<a name=57:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first in importance is the light in every man.<a name=57:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A little simple attention to Scripture I think will make this very plain.<a name=57:5></a> It has been confused, it seems to me, by systems of doctrine current previously in the mind.<a name=57:6></a> As to mere argumentative refutation, Wardlaw has, with the ability of mind with which God has endowed him, plainly shewn the inconsistency of their doctrines in their most favourable point of view, and, I think, however courteous and polite in his statements, plainly shewn Joseph John Gurney to be by far the most inconsistent of all.<a name=57:7></a> For in Mr.<a name=57:8></a> Gurney's system, while he holds justification in an evangelical point of view, he still makes the mediation of Christ to be the procuring cause of that light from which accountability springs -- that is, that the mediation of Christ created the guilt which it put away; and, consequently, that there was no guilt in man previous to the mediation of Christ.<a name=57:9></a> This is clearly an untenable position, and I cannot help feeling that the position held by Mr.<a name=57:10></a> Gurney is the most inconsistent and unsatisfactory of any engaged in the anxieties which press upon Friends.<a name=57:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#57:f1"><sup>+</sup></a> These remarks have chiefly reference to Dr. Wardlaw's Friendly Letters to the Society of Friends.

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, while Dr.<a name=58:1></a> Wardlaw has refuted very ably in many respects the views he opposes, it does not appear to me that he has given anything on the other hand, upon which a sincerely anxious soul could rest; and it also appears to me, that his view of "Christ in us" -- "Christ's dwelling in our hearts" is as objectionable as that of the Friends itself; and that in his anxiety to avoid mysticism, he has destroyed in statement the living power of Christianity itself as a present thing.<a name=58:2></a> His view of the law written in the heart, <i>his</i> substitute for this inward light, I believe to be most unsatisfactory, almost as unsatisfactory as the inward light itself.<a name=58:3></a> For if the law (of which he, with many others, speaks) be so written, it is not merely a knowledge of the divine will without, but that which in some instances at least (for of such the apostle is writing) produces the effects of the law done; and moreover, it is spoken of (I take their use of the sentence) not as a law known externally, which is their ground of defence, but written in the very language, we may say, of the power of the new covenant.<a name=58:4></a> It appears to me, then, I confess, that this law written on the heart of unbelieving Gentiles, is, at the least, as objectionable, if not more so, than the inward light of Friends, and as untenable from Scripture.<a name=58:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards the passage in <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:9">John  1:9</a>, I cannot but think that a calm attention to its statements, and inquiry into its import, will shew to any mind taught of God that, while the divine perfectness was there as the Light, our Lord is spoken of as a Person coming into the world, One to whom John the Baptist bore witness.<a name=58:6></a> This was surely Jesus Christ come in flesh -- the expected Messiah of the Jews, of whom there is this double testimony -- that "he was in the world" (for the testimony was not confined to the Jews, nor was He merely their Messiah, but an universal object of faith -- "he was in the <i>world</i>)"; and, further, that He surely was Jesus, the Messiah, "come to his own [the Jews], and his own received him not.<a name=58:7></a>" How could it be said that any inward light came to His own and His own received Him not, and that, as distinct from, and additional to, His being in the world, and the world not knowing Him?<a name=58:8></a> If this were the inward light, would it not prove that this light was in the world, and men completely unconscious of it?<a name=58:9></a> which would refute itself.<a name=58:10></a> Both are simply and plainly true, and the whole passage most intelligible and to the purpose, as relating to the incarnate Son of God, who was intrinsically

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Further, as to the law written upon the heart, perhaps I shall startle some in saying that the scripture never speaks of "a law written on the heart.<a name=59:4></a>" God puts His laws into the heart in the new covenant, but this is another and a distinct thing.<a name=59:5></a> Nor is sin ever said to be "the transgression of the law," but the contrary.<a name=59:6></a> I am aware that expressions in the English scriptures may carry such a force; but it has no such force in the original scripture.<a name=59:7></a>

		The passage on which accountability is made to rest on a law know, which is after all inward light, is <a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:4">1 John  3:4</a>: "Sin is the transgression of the law.<a name=59:8></a>" Then it is argued further, "Where no law is, there is no transgression"; still, "until the law, sin was in the world": therefore, as there was no outward law, there must have been an inward law, as elsewhere, "These, having not the law, are a law unto themselves, and shew the work of the law written upon their hearts.<a name=59:9></a>" To follow this reasoning in Scripture --

		On the other hand, as to this imputation of offences, we have the prophet's witness: "You only have I <i>known</i> of all the families of the earth; therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities," <a href="../bible/Amos.htm#3:2">Amos  3:2</a>.<a name=60:3></a>

		As to the rule of faith, primary and secondary, the Spirit and the Scriptures, this question has really also been raised, though under different apparent circumstances, by the Roman Catholics; and it has appeared to me always in that controversy, that there was a sophism scarcely ever noticed, which was at the root of all the difficulty; and that is, confounding a rule, or standard, with the means of communicating, or power that communicates, anything to our minds: the tacit assumption that one was equivalent to another.<a name=64:3></a> All Milner's "End of Controversy" hangs upon a statement concealing this false assumption.<a name=64:4></a> "The rule of faith, or means of communicating Christ's religion," he says, "must be such, or such"; which he then shews Scripture not to be, having identified these two ideas.<a name=64:5></a> Admit their identity, and no one can answer him; separate them, and his argument comes simply to nothing.<a name=64:6></a>

		Christians, and real ones, are too apt (though this may seem a strange assertion) to separate, and too apt to confound, Christ and the Spirit.<a name=73:7></a> That is, they separate Christ and the Spirit in operation <i>in</i> us too much; and they confound the work of Christ <i>for</i> us too much with the Spirit.<a name=73:8></a> The consequence of both is, uncertainty, meagreness of judgment, and doubt.<a name=73:9></a>

		The work of the Spirit of God <i>in</i> me, in the power of life, produces conflict, labour, discoveries of sin, and need of mortifying my members which are on the earth; and the more what "<i>Christ is</i>" is revealed in my soul, in the comparison with the discovery of what I am, the more do I find cause of humiliation -- the more do I find, by the contrast of Christ looked at as in the flesh here sinless, God condemning this evil root of sin in the flesh in me.<a name=73:10></a> And much more, by the discovery of what my blessed Lord is, as glorified, do I see through the Spirit, how short I am of "attaining," though I may be still changed into the same likeness, from glory to glory.<a name=73:11></a> Hence, though at peace, hope, perhaps animating hope, and joy betimes filling the soul, yet there will be exercised self-judgment and sorrow of heart at the discovery of how every feeling we have towards God, and every object spiritually known, is short of the just effects they should produce and call out; and hence, too, in case of any allowance or indulgence of

The great object is to separate this from our justification; and that it should be a matter of judging ourselves, not of expecting God's judgment on us. When this discovery of sin in us is made *previous* to any clear knowledge of the work of Christ, it is habitually accompanied with terror or despair -- a very intelligible effect; when *after* that knowledge, the sin is perhaps more deeply abhorred, but it is not with terror as to our condemnation, but characterised by a loathing condemnation of the sin itself.

		The principle, then, on which men dwell, is true; but the revelation of this chapter is much wider and more definite than they suppose.<a name=79:3></a> It is not merely that the man is changed or saved; but he sees and enters a kingdom the world knows nothing of, till it comes in power; and, moreover, that such a one receives a life as true and real, and much more important and blessed, than any natural life in the flesh.<a name=79:4></a> It is not merely changing a man by acting on his faculties, but the giving a life which may act indeed now, through these faculties, on objects far beyond them (as the old and depraved life on objects within its or their reach), but in which he is made partaker of the divine nature, in which not merely the faculties of his soul have new objects, but as in this he was partner with the first Adam, the living soul, so in that with the second Adam, the quickening Spirit.<a name=79:5></a> And we must add, that the Church, in order to its assimilation with Him in it, is made partaker of this, consequent upon His resurrection, and therefore is made partaker of the life according to the power of it thus exhibited, and has its existence consequent upon (yea, as the witness of) the passing away (blessed be God!<a name=79:6></a>) of all the judgment of its sins; for it has its life from, and consequent upon, the resurrection of Christ out of that grave in which, so to speak, He buried them all.<a name=79:7></a> It exists, and has not its existence but consequent upon the absolute accomplishment and passing away of its judgment.<a name=79:8></a>

		sin being laid aside, is, perhaps (it is hard to compare things in these subjects), beyond all other of our thoughts, and lasts through and beyond the actual covenant blessings which are our portion to enjoy as children.<a name=83:1></a> These chastenings may remove for our need: "If needs be, we may be in heaviness through manifold temptations.<a name=83:2></a>" But though the joy may be weakened, the spring of righteous confidence in God is there; and, indeed, we are thrown more abstractedly and essentially upon God.<a name=83:3></a> We should joy in God at all times; but we are apt to turn to the blessings conferred, and in a measure to forget the Blesser.<a name=83:4></a> See <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#63">Psalm  63</a>.<a name=83:5></a> Hence the deprivation, that we may remember Him.<a name=83:6></a> But properly, this well of water springing up into everlasting life is that partaking of the divine nature in which ("having escaped") we joy in God, repose in Him, delight in Him, are filled into His fulness, know Him indeed in the blessedness of actual revelation; but still in the name of God, as such, the power of this communion is conveyed, being rooted and grounded in love, knowing God, and known of Him, it supposes all the rest of truth, and it is found in Christ.<a name=83:7></a> "He hath given us an understanding that we should know him that is true; and we are in him that is true, that is, in his Son Jesus Christ: he is the true God and eternal life.<a name=83:8></a>" Of this we have the perfect exhibition in Jesus, in spite of all trial; for how should the Spirit, which dwelt in all fulness in Him, even as a man, be grieved with divine perfectness?<a name=83:9></a> "Our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son, Jesus Christ.<a name=83:10></a>" "That the love [says the Lord, speaking of the converse, and therefore the power of this] wherewith thou hast loved me, may be in them, and I in them"; and so, as to the form of it, as it were with us: "In that day, ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.<a name=83:11></a>" But now we speak of it as specially knowing God.<a name=83:12></a> I think, if the Psalms be studied, what Christ's Spirit passed through and teaches us will be deeply learnt in this -- there, of course, among Jews it is Jehovah, when He speaks of covenant-blessings, as we have more specially to say, "Father.<a name=83:13></a>" But not resting here on this distinction, if the Psalms, and parts of Psalms, in which Jehovah is used, and in which God is used, be referred to and compared and studied, the deepest practical instruction will be derived as to this power of communion from the Spirit of Christ itself.<a name=83:14></a> Only we must remember that, for us it is founded on an accomplished work, and that which He passed through, as accomplishing it, is to us the fellowship of His sufferings, or loving chastisement.<a name=83:15></a> We may look to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#42">Psalm  42</a>, 43,

	<div class="paragraph">
		Hitherto I have spoken, either of the quickening power of the Spirit of God, as introducing us into the kingdom; or, as dwelling in the individual, as the power of eternal life, through which his communion with God is carried on: this there must be where there is life according to Christ Jesus.<a name=84:6></a> There remains a wide field to treat of, on which I feel almost deterred from entering; not because I fear there is not boundless joy in passing over, and learning it in one's own soul, entering into it; but because it is boundless, and that I feel deeply my inadequacy to do so properly, even to satisfy my own mind: and I will add, especially when one considers the responsibility of being a communicator, and, as it were, teacher of these things to others.<a name=84:7></a> The deep interest and importance of the subject is my excuse: I would not have done it if it had not been pressed on my own mind.<a name=84:8></a> It is the largeness of the subject which deters me.<a name=84:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is one thing I feel it important to notice ere I pass on: though the Spirit is life, and he that is joined to the Lord is one spirit, and Christ as quickening Spirit is our life, yet the Holy Ghost is also spoken of as personally acting in power on our souls -- acting in blessing; for He is God; and while we are made partakers of the divine nature, and have this life of God in us as born of Him, yet this is not the Holy Ghost; for the Holy Ghost is God.<a name=84:10></a> Therefore we read, "The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirits that we are children of God,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=85>[Page 85]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and if children, then heirs"; and therefore, the scripture speaks of the inner spiritual man being strengthened, renewed, as "strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man.<a name=85:1></a>" Though our outward man perish, our "inner man is renewed day by day"; so "the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost, which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour.<a name=85:2></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next point, before I pass on to its character and operation, is to advert to the fact of the special indwelling of the Holy Ghost: I mean <i>in</i> individual believers.<a name=85:3></a> I do not speak of this as if it were new to many who read this paper, but because I daily find it is new to many who inquire: and it puts the subject in entirely a different light.<a name=85:4></a> We shall see that it is connected with, and consequent upon, the ascension and glorifying of Christ; but we must remember that, while the coming down of the Holy Ghost is witness of ascension-glory and divine righteousness, and that our association in it was consequent (in the necessary course of the divine ministrations) upon Christ's entering into the glory, yet was it withal the power to us of all that whence it came, and into which, and association with which, it brings us; and so we shall see in the texts to which I shall refer, closing with the one which more especially introduces me into my present subject; "In whom" (we read in Ephesians), "after <i>that ye believed</i>, ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession.<a name=85:5></a>" I know that this has been referred to gifts merely.<a name=85:6></a> To these I hope to refer before I finish this subject: but that it is not confined to these is manifest, however these may display it, because, in that case, where there were no gifts, there would be no earnest of the inheritance: but the Comforter Himself was to abide for ever.<a name=85:7></a> Besides, gifts are not spoken of here, but the Holy Spirit itself as the earnest; but to confound them, is to confound the Giver and the gift; for the Spirit distributes of these to every man severally as He will, and they are only the <i>manifestation</i> of the Spirit given for profit; and confounding them (unconsciously perhaps) undermines the personality and deity of the Holy Ghost, and confounds the power of witnessing to others (which may be with no vital or sanctifying power) with the blessed and sanctifying communion with, and anticipation of, things hoped for and treasured up in Christ as ours, and to be displayed in that day.<a name=85:8></a> In a word, the

	<div class="paragraph">
		Spirit which distributes the gift is not the gift He distributes, though He be displayed in the gift; nor are the things in which the given power is displayed necessarily any earnest of the inheritance at all; as in the gift of prophecy, as in Balaam's case, and as Paul states the possibility that a man might preach to others, and he himself be a castaway.<a name=86:1></a> And though their characters in some instances are indicative of the dispensation, and their number and circumstances may be different, yet the existence of extraordinary powers and acts in themselves were not characteristic of this indwelling and earnest of the Spirit.<a name=86:2></a> Many and remarkable miracles were wrought, and great power exhibited in service, before this came, before the Son of man was glorified.<a name=86:3></a> But these did not constitute the indwelling of the Spirit in the Church, for there was none such; nor in the individual as an earnest of the inheritance, for they might be there, as in the case of Balaam, already adverted to, and the individual not be an heir.<a name=86:4></a> The Spirit in them might search, and find the things they administered were not unto themselves.<a name=86:5></a> I propose to return a little to this, and would now pursue my more immediate subject.<a name=86:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the Galatians we find -- having shewn that they were sons through faith in Christ Jesus, not servants -- "And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father"; clearly distinguishing between the regenerating power and indwelling of the Holy Ghost, and speaking of one as a consequence of the other -- that it dwelt in an individual who was (and because he was) a son of God.<a name=86:7></a> We also see its distinction from a gift, for it is put in the heart to cry, Abba, Father.<a name=86:8></a> Further, we see that, as in such sort, there, it is proper to, and characteristic of, the dispensation.<a name=86:9></a> For it is not the <i>portion</i> of the heir when an infant, and as a servant, under tutors and governors, which they, <i>even if heirs</i>, were previously, not in immediate communion with the Father personally.<a name=86:10></a> They had not the mind needful for it, not having the Holy Ghost thus.<a name=86:11></a> But it is their portion when they take properly the place of sons, which they do in this dispensation; and though they do not as yet enter upon the inheritance, yet are they to have the mind renewed in knowledge concerning it, and enter into the full interests of the Father's house.<a name=86:12></a>

		Again, where the connection of things hoped for, and the power of communion in which they are enjoyed in the certainty of God's love, are brought together, "hope maketh not ashamed, because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost given unto us.<a name=87:4></a>" Again, in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#1">2 Corinthians  1</a>, "For all the promises of God in him are Yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us.<a name=87:5></a> Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God; who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts" -- a very full and blessed passage: God, the great Author of it all and power by which it is wrought, establishing us in Christ, our glorious and blessed Head, in the communion of all like glory with Him; in the communion of that in which, by the fulfilment of all the promises in their amazing blessedness in Christ Himself, <i>God is</i> glorified: and this, while we are assumed in grace into a portion with Him, we being the very subjects of the blessing, not merely in consequence but in association, and therefore having all the consequences.<a name=87:6></a> It is ours, the promises being in Christ, to the glory of God <i>by us</i>.<a name=87:7></a> Now God stablishes us in this portion: how do we know it?<a name=87:8></a> How is it marked?<a name=87:9></a> How enjoyed, and the earnest possessed, while we have it not, when the glory is not yet come?<a name=87:10></a> God hath established us in it: that is the assurance and security.<a name=87:11></a> He hath anointed us with that unction from Himself -- the Holy One -- whereby we know all things (compare the whole of <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#1:7">2 Corinthians  1:7</a> to the end, where this is fully explained); but then the having the Spirit is the seal or mark whereby we are significantly denoted as belonging to God, as His heirs: "If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his"; but being given us to dwell in us, in that we are heirs, we have it as an earnest in our hearts; abounding in hope through the power of the Holy Ghost; knowing that we are sons, and delighting in the thought of the inheritance, and of being like Him who is "the firstborn among many brethren"; and in this joy of the Holy Ghost, filled (it may be in the midst of much affliction) with all joy and peace in believing, the soul entering,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=88>[Page 88]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		as associated with Christ (and in this lies much, and that of the very kernel of the joy, though not all), into all the glory in which the promises of God are fulfilled in Him.<a name=88:1></a> I say, not all the joy; because it is not only (with what riches are we endowed, yea, beyond all thought!<a name=88:2></a>) "As <i>my Father hath loved me, so</i> have I loved you": a blessing known, had communion with by the Spirit, as our portion, of which the glory is the display, as enjoyed along with Him; but "that the world may know that <i>thou</i> hast loved them as thou hast loved me"; and therefore they are not only companions with the Son of man in the glory, but in adoption sons of God, as brethren, being brought into this joy, as in the Father's kingdom, more properly the Father's <i>house</i>, where the place is prepared for us by the great Firstborn.<a name=88:3></a> Thus the Son's rich and unjealous love (for it is divine), in giving us the glory which was given to Him, displays us in the glory, which approves before the world that the Father has loved us as He loved Him.<a name=88:4></a> Was ever anything like this in love?<a name=88:5></a> Does it not, in its very conception, prove it altogether divine?<a name=88:6></a> None could deal, act, or know in such sort but God; and the very possession of these things in our hearts is the witness that God is there, if they be known in love, holy love; for "he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.<a name=88:7></a>" And these things we have now, not in possession indeed, but in (the earnest of the) Spirit; as the same Spirit by the apostle speaks: "These things write we unto you, that your joy may be full," "that ye also may have fellowship with us; and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.<a name=88:8></a>" This is a very holy place to dwell in, one that becometh saints -- one that nothing but the blood of Jesus could purchase -- none but God by His wondrous work in Christ present us faultless in the presence of.<a name=88:9></a> Yet, blessed be His grace (and the more blessed because it is holy and enjoyed), in that we have the Holy Spirit revealing it, giving us a divine spiritual communion with it, sealing us as heirs of all of it and the power of our joy in it; -this is our place, our portion: O my soul, dwell there in joy -- joy with Christ.<a name=88:10></a> You will note, He says, "His Son Jesus Christ"; which is not only the expression of faith, but presenting our blessed Lord in that character -- the Saviour, the anointed Man -- in which He has brought us into fellowship, and associated us with Him in this sonship, and given us fellowship moreover with the Father as sons; ourselves sons, though in Him.<a name=88:11></a> And the converse of

		But the joy and blessedness of which I speak leads me at once to the statement?<a name=89:5></a> "He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.<a name=89:6></a>" Here again, you will remark, it is an individual matter -- the believer's portion, however it may be ministered.<a name=89:7></a> "This spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive; for the Holy Ghost was not yet [given], because that Jesus was not yet glorified.<a name=89:8></a>" Now this statement (as I think we shall see) is one of extreme importance, and connected with the whole character and state of the dispensation, as being that of God's blessings, which are beyond all dispensation, except the fact of giving the Spirit as the power of divine life and worship, inasmuch as they lead into communion with Himself.<a name=89:9></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Secondly, as given; and thus a well of water in us springing up into everlasting life -- thus, too, as manifesting, or connected with the riches of grace, making us know the Father as seeking such to worship the God of love, and enabling us to worship Him in spirit and in truth, as thus known in the grace that has sought us -- brought in by faith to fellowship with Him, fellowship with the Father and the Son, out of every nation: in a word, the dispensation of the manifested Son, manifested to faith as One with whom we are in union through the Spirit -- this by the gift of grace.<a name=103:3></a>

		Thirdly, as flowing forth from us, a river of refreshings, and this in connection with the glory of the Son of man; and therefore not so much the power of worship as the earnest of glory, and the power of refreshing, and glorious testimony that man in Him prevails and has the glory; though yet he must wait for it till He be manifested to the world set right indeed by His presence in that great feast of tabernacles.<a name=103:4></a>

		The first of these chapters (<a href="../bible/John.htm#3">John  3</a>) closed proper Jewish intercourse, shewing that they must be born again to enter into the kingdom of God: and so was <i>every one</i> that was born of the Spirit (the cross, or the lifting up of the Son of man, closing all present earthly associations, and introducing heavenly things as yet unknown).<a name=103:5></a> In the second (<a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>), the Lord, having thereon left Judea, going into Galilee passes through Samaria, and there, with one of the most worthless of that reprobate race, shews the gift of God, and the consequence of the humiliation of the Son of God, thereon introducing the Father's name and spiritual worship by grace.<a name=103:6></a> Thus the gospel dispensation is introduced by it, and its worship, sonship, and joy.<a name=103:7></a> In the third (<a href="../bible/John.htm#7">John  7</a>) we find it flowing forth from filled affections to the world, the witness, though not the accomplishment, of that day when Jesus shall appear in the glory witnessed of, and it shall be as life from the dead: and that, indeed, through His then unbelieving brethren here below.<a name=103:8></a> Chapter 4 (that is, the second of those alluded to) is more large and general, as the power of all living communion with God, and thus is <i>specially</i> the saints' place.<a name=103:9></a> It identifies itself more especially with the present prayer of <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3">Ephesians  3</a>, founded on the title, "Father of our Lord Jesus Christ," though that goes farther.<a name=103:10></a> Chapter 7

	<div class="paragraph">
		That I may not omit the intervening chapters of John, but that we may see what a summary of divine theology it is, as a testimony to the Person of the Lord Jesus in its height above all dispensation, I would here observe, that chapter 5 contrasts the entire incompetency of any restorative power connected with the law (because it required strength in the patient, which was just what the disease of sin had destroyed, as well as his righteousness which would not have needed it), in a word, the entire futility of <i>all remedial</i> processes, with the absolute life-giving power of the Son of God in union with the Father; and shews, in addition, on His rejection (the rejection of His word, for so that power wrought), the judicial power put entirely into His hands as Son of man to execute judgment on all that rejected Him, that all men might honour the Son, even as they honoured the Father.<a name=104:2></a>

		of the order and circumstances of the dispensation having been given, the humiliation of Jesus, as the portion of the Church during His priesthood, is then shewn as affording its food and strength of life.<a name=105:1></a> First, His coming down and incarnation -- the manna, the true bread that came down from heaven; next, as sacrificed, and giving the life He had thus taken as man -- believers thereon eating His flesh and drinking His blood, thus living by Him; then, closing by the question, "What and if ye shall see the Son <i>of man</i> ascend up where he was before?<a name=105:2></a>" This, as we have seen, is followed by the instruction of chapter 7, where the time for the manifestation of the Son of man to the world <i>was not yet come</i>, and the gift of the Holy Ghost <i>as the intermediate witness of His glory as Son of man</i> is spoken of.<a name=105:3></a> This point has been spoken of in the former part of these remarks; I revert to it now, merely as shewing the beautiful order of the instruction of the Spirit in the gospel of John.<a name=105:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another point connected with the operations of the Spirit of our God, which remains to be touched upon -- His corporate operations, or His operations as acting in connection with the body of Christ, both as maintaining, and the very centre of, its unity; and also as ministering in the diversity of His gifts; and also the distinction between this and His individual presence in the believer.<a name=105:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This last difference will be found to be important, and to flow from, and be connected with, the whole order of the economy of grace, of which the Spirit of God is the great agent in us, and though not received there, still in a certain sense in testimony in the world.<a name=105:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This difference depends on the relative character which Christ stands in: first, with the Father, as Son, and us by adoption made sons with Him: and, secondly, with God, as the Head of the body, which is His fulness the Church.<a name=105:7></a> We shall find the Scriptures speak definitely of both, and distinctly: in one, the Lord Jesus holds a more properly divine relationship with the Father, and introduces us by adoption into something of the enjoyment of that nearness; in the other, a relationship (though all be divine) yet more connected with His human nature and His offices in that, and therefore God is spoken of as <i>His God</i>.<a name=105:8></a> The distinction and reality of these two things are expressed by the blessed Lord going away.<a name=105:9></a> Having accomplished the redemption, which enabled Him to present His brethren along with Himself as sons to the Father, in His

		(the Father's) house, spotless, and sons by adoption, and to assume His place as the Head of the body, the Church, He did not yet allow Himself to be touched and worshipped as in bodily presence in His earthly kingdom; for He was not yet ascended to His Father, so that He could bring forth the fulness of His glory, and that that kingdom should be manifestly of the Father, and have its root and source in that higher glory; but putting His friends, and that for the first time, into the place of sons and brethren, He says to them (thus setting the saints, and Himself for them, in their place), "Go, tell my brethren, I ascend unto my Father and your Father, to my God and your God"; thus establishing these two relationships, and His disciples along with Himself in them.<a name=106:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the Lord ascended up on high for the accomplishment in power of what He now spoke of, in the truth and efficacy of the work which He had accomplished, and the value of His presented Person before the Father, as well as the blood by which sin was put away.<a name=106:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On this statement in John hangs in fact the distinction to which I have alluded, followed up in Scripture by many other passages.<a name=106:3></a> It is the definite revelation of the characters in which Jesus Christ was going away, and which He was to sustain in our behalf on high, placing us in fellowship with God and the Father in them.<a name=106:4></a> There was another point, however, connected with this, involved in the position which Christ assumed: <i>He is the displayer of the divine glory</i>, His Father's glory.<a name=106:5></a> "He that hath seen me hath seen <i>the Father</i>.<a name=106:6></a>" <i>He shall appear in the Father's glory</i>.<a name=106:7></a> He was on earth "God manifest in the flesh," seen too of angels: again, "the brightness of God's glory, the express image of his person.<a name=106:8></a>" His glory too was sonship, as of the only begotten of the Father, as again, "the only begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.<a name=106:9></a>" In Him all the fulness was pleased to dwell; and, as afterwards stated, in fact, as in good pleasure, "In him <i>dwelleth</i> all the fulness of the Godhead <i>bodily</i>.<a name=106:10></a>" Thus we see the Person of the Lord Jesus, the place in which divine glory is in every sense manifested.<a name=106:11></a> But He is now hid in God: that is the position which He has now taken.<a name=106:12></a> And thereon the Holy Ghost is sent down into the world to maintain the witness and manifestation of His glory (not brought out yet visibly on earth, but personally accomplished on high, "crowned with

		glory and honour"), and to be the earnest and testimony of His title to the earth.<a name=107:1></a> The Church on earth is the place and depositary of this.<a name=107:2></a> "He shall receive of mine and shall shew it unto you.<a name=107:3></a> All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you.<a name=107:4></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, the Holy Ghost, as thus sent down from heaven, is the witness of what Christ is there for us towards the Father; and what His title is as of God towards the world and specially therein what the power of the hope of the calling and inheritance of God in the saints is.<a name=107:5></a> The enjoyment and testimony of these things may be much blended in the operations of the present Spirit; but they are distinct.<a name=107:6></a> As for example, the display of my portion in Christ as the Son before the Father may fill my heart and make me a witness and a testimony of it, to the blessing and comfort of the Church, if the Lord accompany it with the suitable gift of communication; and the power of it in my soul in joy is intimately blended with the thing to be expressed; because so the Holy Ghost acts in this work.<a name=107:7></a> It is therefore said, "Out of <i>his belly</i> shall flow rivers of living water.<a name=107:8></a>" Still they are quite distinct: for a man may have these things shewn to his soul, and enjoy them, and yet not have the gift to communicate them to others; though they be the deep (possibly, I suppose, the deeper) joy of his own: so that, though connected when both are there, they are distinct things.<a name=107:9></a> I suppose that those who have gift of testimony have often found as much (or more) joy in hearing the blessed things of Christ, as in uttering them; though the sense and joy of the blessed things may have ministered to their capacity of utterance.<a name=107:10></a> I would speak then distinctively of these two points, though their blending, if the Lord will, may be noticed.<a name=107:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the earlier passages in John, and the remarks which were made upon them, the Holy Ghost who is sent was spoken of as the power of life, the power of communion, the power of communication.<a name=107:12></a> In the latter part of John and other places <i>the sending</i> of the Spirit is specially spoken of, because the absence and going away of Christ were brought before their minds as a present fact; and hence the Spirit is shewn as the sustainer of the relationships induced by the mystery of Christ being thus hid in God, and another Comforter sent.<a name=107:13></a> Life communion with God the Father and the Son, communications concerning the glory of the Son of man, were all distinct and

		It is introduced in John by the statement made to His disciples, "As I said unto the Jews, so now I say unto you, Whither I go, ye cannot come.<a name=108:4></a>" In the earlier part of the subsequent chapter the Lord introduces their comfort -- that He was to be the object of faith as God was; that He was not going to be alone in blessedness, and leave them here to themselves in misery, but going to prepare a place for them; and that He would come again and receive them to Himself; that where He was they might be -- a far better thing than His being with them in the condition they were in.<a name=108:5></a> But meanwhile they knew where He was going, and the way.<a name=108:6></a> This resulted, as He explained to them, from their knowing the Father (to whom He was going), in knowing Him; for He was in the Father and the Father in Him.<a name=108:7></a> Thus, the great scene into which they were brought in the knowledge of the Person of the Lord Jesus, and His oneness with the Father -- He in the Father and the Father in Him -- was introduced; the scene of associated blessedness, into which the disciples were brought by the living knowledge which they had of Jesus, was declared; <i>but the power</i> in which it was <i>known</i> and <i>enjoyed</i> was not yet.<a name=108:8></a> But the knowledge of the Father through the Son, as the object of faith, was now declared, and the subsequent display of His glory in the world by reason of the exaltation of the Lord Jesus spoken of.<a name=108:9></a> The Lord, then, urging obedience to Him as the way of receiving blessing, takes the place of Mediator to obtain the Comforter for them -- another Comforter, who should not leave them as He was doing, but was to abide with them <i>for</i> ever.<a name=108:10></a> This it was that was the <i>power</i> of their association with that of which they had heard before -- the fellowship of the Father and the Son: first, of the Father with the Son, and the Son with the Father; and then of them with both, in that it was by the Holy Ghost dwelling in them, the Comforter now sent.<a name=108:11></a> Thus, though they could not come there, they saw Jesus, and He came to them, and with the Father made His mansion with them, till He came and took them into the mansions of His Father's house.<a name=108:12></a>

		This chapter 14, then, gives us the blessedness -- the knowledge of the Father and the Son, by the Son; the order of it, obedience to the Son; the power of it, the presence of the Comforter obtained through the mediation of Christ; but thereon (consequent on this presence) their <i>knowledge</i> that He was in the Father, they in Him and He in them -- a blessing far beyond mere mediation, but consequent on the presence of the Spirit obtained by mediation.<a name=109:1></a> This also is added as a consequence: that the Father and the Son would come and make their abode with them.<a name=109:2></a> Still, in this chapter, whatever the effect of the mediation in their knowledge was, Christ does not go beyond the place of Mediator here, and therefore He tells them that the Father will send the Spirit in His name, and He (the Spirit) would recall all the Lord's words and instruction to them.<a name=109:3></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#109:f1"><sup>+</sup></a> In fact, in chapter 14, Christ speaks much more as on earth (see verse 25), though on the ground of His going away, and shews them they should have known His Person (in the power of which He speaks; as, "I will do it") there, and thus have known where He was going, and the way. After verse 16 He speaks more of their position on His going away, and its consequences, still as being yet there. Hence the word *is* (they being looked at in this character, and the Father on high), "I will pray the Father, and he will give." In chapter 16, where union has been treated of, and they as it were placed in Him before the Father, it is, "I say not that I will pray the Father for you"; and they ask in His name; for they were so placed before the Father. And in the end of chapter 15 it is, "whom I will send." "Arise, let us go hence" closes the mere individual earthly place. <p>Chapter 15 does not declare the exaltation of Christ as the Head on high, but (Israel, the nominal vine, being rejected) His being the true vine Himself, even here below, and fruit bearing to be the test of abiding in it. We know that it is in exalted headship in heaven at God's right hand, that He is now thus the living source of fruit bearing; but this is no part of the statement in chapter 15; but the testimony of the Holy Ghost is direct evidence that He was gone up there, accepted and glorified of the Father. Remarking this much elucidates @John 15. It is the then connection of the disciples with Him, and fruit, but not exaltation to heaven.

		Hence, in this passage, it is not the Father who is spoken of as sending the Holy Ghost in the Mediator's name, but the Lord Jesus <i>who sends</i> the Comforter from the Father, in connection with His glory, to testify of His glory, proceeding from the Father.<a name=110:2></a> It is to be remarked here, that while much of this latter part connects itself very closely in detail with the operations of the Holy Ghost, given in connection with the Lord Jesus, as calling God His God as well as ours; as the Man who, through grace, places Himself in association with <i>us in deed</i> as in glory, yet He never, in this part of scripture, puts Himself out of the place of the Son paramount to all dispensation.<a name=110:3></a> Though He may take the lowest place in service and obedience, still it is on a principle paramount to all dispensation; or though the acts alluded to may have their place in connection with dispensed power (as the testimony of the Spirit will be found to have), yet still Christ holds the place here, in which He sends Him for that purpose, as paramount to the associations revealed by the Spirit, so sent, in those acts.<a name=110:4></a> He testifies that all that the Father has are His, as Son (though the acts by which He may do it may be the witness and consequence of a union with Christ), putting, by grace, ourselves and Him, not merely as sons before the Father <i>individually</i>, but as a <i>body</i> with its <i>head</i> before God.<a name=110:5></a>

He had not been with Jesus from the beginning. When he saw Jesus, he saw Him only in the glory of His heavenly Lordship, of which the Holy Ghost testified to. This made his testimony a more purely heavenly testimony; as he says, "Yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more." Peter, in testimony, would hardly have said this, though preaching the same truths; he says, "A witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed."

		dispensation on earth, as of deeds done <i>in the body</i>.<a name=111:1></a> Thus this gospel begins anterior to Genesis, which recounts the creation of the scene on which dispensations have been displayed: there, "In the beginning God created"; here, "In the beginning was the Word," by whom all things were created.<a name=111:2></a> And the Church derives its existence and heavenly fulness from this sovereign source, the purpose of it being effectuated consequent on the rejection of the Son of man, who would have been the righteous crown of all natural dispensation, but who, as risen, associates the redeemed Church with Himself, in a position paramount to it all, even His own association of sonship with the Father, in the privilege of the same love.<a name=111:3></a> And the Holy Ghost is here sent down of Him, the witness and power of this, and therefore in His own action paramount to all dispensation, but this only in the fact of His testimony to Him as so exalted; and this is the point John here takes up.<a name=111:4></a> Now the manifestation of His (Christ's) corporate headship to the Church (in which He says in our behalf, "My God," as He had said so in blessed title of righteousness when the Pattern of our place below) depends (and hence the <i>present manifestation</i> of the Church's glory as united to Him) on the obedience of the Church, and its suitableness to be made an instrument of display here -- quite a distinct thing from the certainty of its union to, and the known and infallible glory of, its Head on high.<a name=111:5></a> This is a permanent revelation, not a responsible manifestation which partakes of the nature of a dispensation on earth, though the glory testified in it may be above all mere dispensation, for its Head and for itself.<a name=111:6></a> The joy, moreover, and sense of glory, may also depend on obedience and consistency, not the permanent fact that the Spirit testifies of His glory in the Church.<a name=111:7></a> Thus in <a href="../bible/John.htm#15">John  15</a>it is written, "If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.<a name=111:8></a>" There could clearly be no doubt of the Son's continuing in the Father's love; but the dispensation of this on earth hung on the obedience on earth -- in Him, infallibly perfect, and therefore so its consequences -- in us continual failure and its consequences also.<a name=111:9></a>

		From the remarks I have already made, it will be seen that in <a href="../bible/John.htm#16">John  16</a>the Spirit and His testimony, as there presented to us, are the indefeasible portion of the saints, the necessary testimony of the glory of Christ.<a name=112:3></a> It forms and sustains the Church, instead of depending on the Church's obedience, although the extent of the Church's enjoyment of the blessing may hang upon that obedience.<a name=112:4></a> He is the witness of the acceptance by the Father of the obedience of Christ, the perfect Son of God, and of the glory of His Person: thus establishing our present standing with God and our Father, and the place of the Church, owning this by His operation through grace, in contrast with the world which rejected Jesus as the Son of God<a href="#112:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>.<a name=112:5></a> Hence, although the obedient disciples of the Lord Jesus were the instruments of the testimony, yet these are dropped as regards the testimony in the first instance; and the subject spoken of is the Comforter's testimony in a conviction of the world.<a name=112:6></a> He is present as the witness of the glory of Christ.<a name=112:7></a> That is, as the abiding power of the dispensation, the <i>necessary</i> character of the testimony of <i>His very presence in the world</i> was this -- that He was come into condemnation of the whole world before God; for it had rejected the Son whom the Father had sent in love to it.<a name=112:8></a> He had said, "I have yet one Son"; and they had cast Him out.<a name=112:9></a> Not merely Jews were in question, the world had done it: "He was despised and rejected of men.<a name=112:10></a>" Every grace of God, every righteousness of man, had been shewn in the Son of God: they had seen no beauty in Him that they should desire Him.<a name=112:11></a> Nay more, as the Lord had distinctly shewn of the world, they had both seen and hated both Him and the Father -- hated Him, blessed and perfect in His ways, without a cause.<a name=112:12></a>

And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, who shall abide with you for ever."

		The presence of the Holy Ghost implies and involves this -- the need, before God, of Christ's glory.<a name=114:3></a> In this He acts as a servant, as it were, not speaking of Himself, but what He hears, <i>that</i> speaking.<a name=114:4></a> Whatever the means instrumentally used, this is the subject and the power.<a name=114:5></a> The Holy Ghost is faithful in this service.<a name=114:6></a> He must be so; for Christ is to be glorified.<a name=114:7></a> And this secures the witness of Christ's glory, in whatever measure, according to its faithfulness; this is the Church's delight.<a name=114:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It appears to me that the communication of the Holy Ghost, as noticed in chapter 20 of this gospel, is (as to the place it holds there) of the character already spoken of.<a name=114:11></a> The whole of that chapter is a sort of picture of the dispensation in brief.<a name=114:12></a> It is not the Head and the body, but Christ in His personal title to send, as the Father sent Him; and giving them, in His risen power capacity to execute the mission, the abiding essential service of those now called to it, whatever measure of power it might be executed in.<a name=114:13></a> But Christ has not only gone to the Father, and been seated in the glory which He had with Him before the world was, and sent the Comforter, the witness of that glory, and the assurance to the saints of their sonship and fellowship with Him in it -- 'His Father and their Father'; but He takes a place as Head of the body (is its Lord indeed and source of supply, but also its Head), and to receive for it that which He sends forth and ministers to it.<a name=114:14></a> Christ has a double character in this -- Lord, and Head of His

	<div class="paragraph">
		As Head of the body, the Lord Jesus displays the Church with Himself in a common glory; but in all this He is spoken of as the subject of God's power (see <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:19">Ephesians  1:19</a>-23), and even where spoken of as Lord, still as a recipient, and as made so: though while this is true (because He humbled Himself and became a man, so that God also has highly exalted Him, that He should have a name which is above every name), every believer finds the very basis of His faith in that He is the true God and eternal life.<a name=115:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2">Philippians  2</a>is the full statement of this great truth -- this blessed truth (having all its value from His being truly and essentially God), that He humbled Himself, that, as a man for our sakes, and as obedient to death, He might, as man, be exalted to the place of Lord, due to Him in glory.<a name=115:4></a> As my subject is the presence of the Holy Ghost, I do not remark farther on this passage, than that it seems to me a special contrast with the first Adam, who, being man, sought to exalt himself, and became disobedient unto death, or under death by disobedience: whereas the history of the Second Man is, that He made Himself of no reputation in becoming a man; and death to Him was the highest, fullest act of obedience and confidence then, as man, in His Father.<a name=115:5></a> And therefore God highly exalted Him; as sinful man was by his disobedience cast down, who sought to exalt himself and to be as Elohim.<a name=115:6></a> In this, then, we have the great doctrine of the exaltation of Jesus as the new man, the Second Adam, the Head of a new race -- the depositary of power; in whom man was, according to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8">Psalm  8</a>, "set over all things.<a name=115:7></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		I would now trace some of the scriptures connected with this point.<a name=116:5></a> In this the Holy Ghost is a Spirit of power, not a Spirit of sonship (though it may be, the sons, having the Holy Ghost, have the power according to His will, by His presence working in them).<a name=116:6></a> This presence of the Holy Ghost is withal corporate presence, that is, His operation; though, as the body, it works by individuals, of course, but by them properly as members of the body, working in power, not in communion.<a name=116:7></a> Consequently, we see, if the gift was not available for the body (where the edification of the body was the intent of the gift), it was to be suppressed in its exercise, even though confessedly the gift of the Holy Ghost.<a name=116:8></a> For the particular gift of the Spirit was to be subjected to the title and rule of the Holy Ghost in the whole (as the member to the mind of the whole body), for the glory of Christ (though power was entrusted to the individual for that use of the whole body, for that glory), and the glory of the body with Him; for no power was rightly used out of the objects of the grace that gave it.<a name=116:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This train I have been led into by the first scripture I would refer to -- <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24">Luke  24</a>.<a name=116:10></a> There Christ is looked at as exalted in glory, and the world and all flesh alike here below.<a name=116:11></a> It is not there, "Go .<a name=116:12></a>.<a name=116:13></a>.<a name=116:14></a> disciple all the Gentiles," as in Matthew; but repentance and remission of sins to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem -- merely the first place here below amongst them.<a name=116:15></a> This commission Peter was accomplishing in his early sermons

	<div class="paragraph">
		But before I enter on the formal economy of the Spirit, as presented in these chapters, I would turn to the doctrine of the word relating to it, as the ordinary portion of the Church in general, as there are one or two passages of scripture which speak definitely of it in this light.<a name=121:3></a> The resurrection had marked out Jesus to be the Son of God, according to the Spirit of holiness.<a name=121:4></a> He might be of the seed of David according to the flesh, but He was the Son of God according to entirely another life, spirit, and energy.<a name=121:5></a> Of this His resurrection was at once the proof and the glorious character; for it was triumph over death, of which, according to that life and holiness which was in Him, it was not possible (though He might imputatively take sin) that He could be holden.<a name=121:6></a> In this resurrection and power of accomplished and triumphant liberty -- liberty of perfectness and sanctification of man to God in a new state of life, in which man had never been -- He became the Head of a new family, the Firstborn from the dead, the Head of the body, the Church, having in all things the pre-eminence, and the Son, taking His place now, as such, in resurrection.<a name=121:7></a> Thus our justification became in fact identified with our position as sons, and as risen (i.<a name=121:8></a>e.<a name=121:9></a>, with holiness, according to its character in resurrection) before God as children.<a name=121:10></a> Therefore it was that, if the apostle had known Christ Jesus after the flesh, henceforth he knew Him no more; for he now knew Him in this character of resurrection, the Head of the new creation -- the new family of God -- the Second Man, and so to us the quickening Spirit, when our living souls had spiritually died in the first Adam in sin -- the head of a new family of men, with whom, in the close, the tabernacle of God should be.<a name=121:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The justification of the Church having been first reasoned out by the Spirit, the apostle turns to this: first, as regards death and resurrection, in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>; then, as regards the law, chapter 7; i.<a name=121:12></a>e.<a name=121:13></a>, first, "nature" or "the flesh" <i>in se</i>, then the operation of the law on the question into which spiritual understanding and a new will brought the conscience; and in chapter 8 he takes up the presence of the Spirit in moral

		operation and witness.<a name=122:1></a> Having stated the source of this mighty change and holy liberty, in "the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus" (the breath of life to our souls being <i>the very same power</i> in which Christ was raised from the dead, and our partaking in all the consequences of that resurrection; God having done what the law could not do, i.<a name=122:2></a>e.<a name=122:3></a>, condemned sin in the flesh, <i>and that in atonement</i>, in grace to us), the apostle proceeds to instruct us what the <i>power</i> and the <i>character</i> of the Spirit in this new nature is.<a name=122:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is the Spirit of God, as contrasted with man <i>in the flesh</i>.<a name=122:5></a> It is the Spirit <i>of Christ</i>, in respect of the form and character of this new man.<a name=122:6></a> It is the Spirit <i>of Him that raised up Christ from the dead</i>, according to the power and energy in which it works <i>full deliverance in result</i>.<a name=122:7></a> Thus its moral character and operation were unfolded, as a Spirit of power and deliverance and character in us, in answer to the question, Who shall deliver us from the body of this death?<a name=122:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there was also the doctrine of the relationship which we have in the new man, as well as moral character and power.<a name=122:9></a> As many as are led of it are sons; sons, and therefore "heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with Him, that we may be also glorified together.<a name=122:10></a>" And here the groaning is not the question of what we are <i>as to God's judgment of evil in us</i>, a spirit of bondage to fear; but our own judgment of it <i>in its effects</i> because we <i>are sons</i>, and are <i>certain</i> that we are, and <i>know</i> that we are heirs.<a name=122:11></a> We take up the groaning of the whole creation, of which we are part, as in the body, and express it to God in sympathy, in the sense of the blessedness of the glorious inheritance when the creation shall be delivered; suffering <i>with Christ</i> in the present sorrow by His Spirit, and express it in the Spirit of God, even though we have no intelligence to ask for any actual remedy.<a name=122:12></a> In this, then, the Spirit has a double office: the witness with us, for joy, that we are sons and heirs, and helping us in the infirmities lying on creation and on us in the body; and when He, thus acting in us in sympathy, thus groans in us expressive of the sorrow, He who searches the hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, <i>because</i> He maketh intercession for us according to God.<a name=122:13></a>

		Having spoken on this passage in a previous paper, I do not enlarge on it.<a name=123:7></a> But there is another collateral passage which I would not pass by, relative to the knowledge, communication, and reception of the revelations of the Spirit; shewing our entire dependence on that blessed Comforter and power of God for all knowledge of these things (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2">1 Corinthians  2</a>): "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him; but God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit.<a name=123:8></a>" Man's heart never conceived them, but God revealed them to His saints by His Spirit.<a name=123:9></a> They had received the Spirit which was of God, that they might know.<a name=123:10></a> They spoke by words which the Holy Ghost taught, communicating, as I should translate it, spiritual things by a spiritual medium; and they were, moreover, spiritually discerned: they were known, communicated, and received by the Spirit.<a name=123:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having noticed these collateral passages, I pass on to the point of corporate operation of the Holy Ghost in the union of the body.<a name=123:12></a> The testimony to the Lordship of Christ, and that character of His exaltation, we have already seen in the addresses of Peter to Israel.<a name=123:13></a> This, of course, is never lost: but we have seen the additional truth of the identity of Christ and the Church -- the very basis of Paul's special ministry, brought out in the question to the apostle, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?<a name=123:14></a>" Just as the sin of the first Adam was brought out

		by the terrible question, "Where art thou?<a name=124:1></a>" It is upon this that the grace of the ministration of the Spirit now was to have its course.<a name=124:2></a> The Spirit had borne witness by certain disciples; and the Church thereby had been gathered.<a name=124:3></a> The Church now was to be the vehicle for the testimony and witness of the Spirit corporately.<a name=124:4></a> The distinct revelation of this position of the Church, and its establishment in it, in the intelligence and actuality of its standing, began by the scattering of the assembly at Jerusalem, and by the apostle (having been called and enabled by the Lord, and having preached at once, and thus laid by in a measure for a time) recommencing the work from Antioch as a centre, whence he was separated to the work to which Christ had called him, not by the appointment of Jesus after the flesh, but by the authoritative direction of the Holy Ghost in the disciples.<a name=124:5></a> Paul had no part in the testimony mentioned in <a href="../bible/John.htm#15:27">John  15:27</a>.<a name=124:6></a> It was only the Holy Ghost's testimony, and seeing the glory of Christ, and hearing the words of His mouth.<a name=124:7></a> Hence it was not a testimony to the exaltation and Lordship of Him whose companions they had been on earth (that God had exalted Him to be Lord and Christ there); but starting from the point of His Lordship seen in glory, that He was the Son of God, and a testimony, and of course owning it, to the union of the whole body, Jew and Gentile, with Him so exalted to God's right hand.<a name=124:8></a> Hence the operations of the Holy Ghost -- always following the testimony concerning Christ, while still declaring and subservient to His Lordship -- wrought in the unity of the whole body according to the operations of God.<a name=124:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence we read in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>, "Concerning spiritual things, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.<a name=124:10></a> Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.<a name=124:11></a> Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit <i>of God</i> calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say, Lord Jesus (or, call Jesus Lord) but by the Holy Ghost.<a name=124:12></a>" That is, whoever does so (i.<a name=124:13></a>e.<a name=124:14></a>, in Spirit) does so by the Holy Ghost; for it was the <i>Holy</i> Spirit that testified that Jesus was Lord, not an <i>evil</i> one.<a name=124:15></a>

		It is not the Trinity (Father, Son, and Holy Ghost) which is here presented to us, though from other scriptures we may know its connection with it, but God, the Lord, and the Spirit, working in the Church upon earth; though, lest we should suppose He was not God, it is afterwards said, "All these worketh that one and the self-same Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.<a name=125:2></a> For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.<a name=125:3></a> For by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.<a name=125:4></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have here, then, these two points: the <i>Lordship of Christ</i>, and <i>that</i> taking its place as to the services of which the gifts were the power; and the <i>unity of the whole body</i>, in which, as by its members, the Spirit wrought according to their diverse appropriate functions.<a name=125:5></a> The operation being all the while God's operation, but ordered according to the functions of the body, and the purport of the whole; for the members' service was for the good of the whole body.<a name=125:6></a>

		From this, I think, we distinctly learn the order of the ministration of the Holy Ghost, as thus presented to us.<a name=125:7></a> What additional instruction the word may give us, we shall afterwards see.<a name=125:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		First, there was the primary testimony that Christ was Lord -- more correctly, that Jesus was Lord.<a name=125:9></a> That formed the great basic truth.<a name=125:10></a> All was subservient to this.<a name=125:11></a> The Holy Ghost as in operation, though supreme to distribute, was subservient to this.<a name=125:12></a> This was the great testimony He blessedly rendered.<a name=125:13></a> It is this, and not as touching the question of His divinity, makes the apostle say, "To us there is but one God the Father, and one Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=125:14></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		These gifts of the Spirit, then, set them in ministries to the Lord, in which they were individually responsible for their exercise to Christ -- talents with which they were to trade; but then they were responsible to exercise them within the body, according to the order in which they were set in the body, and in subjection to the mind of the Lord the Head of the body.<a name=126:5></a> This preserved entire <i>the full personal responsibility and liberty</i>; for no one was Lord but one, not even an apostle, and yet mutual dependence, healthful for all, even for an apostle; for the Lord's authority was as great over the foot or over the hand, and as exclusive, as over the apostle himself.<a name=126:6></a> Nor would an apostle, having still the flesh to contend with, keep his place unless this were carefully held.<a name=126:7></a> Though by pre-eminence of gift he might guide, lead, direct, and, by revelation from the Lord, give a commandment to the Church, he could not in the smallest degree or tittle touch the direct responsibility of the least member to Christ the Lord Himself; he would have been setting up himself as the Vine, as lord over God's heritage, had he done so.<a name=126:8></a> The apostles were alone as helpers of joy, and <i>that</i> by authority entrusted for edification, but never as lords over their faith.<a name=126:9></a> Authority, however, as gift from the Lord, increased responsibility; but of this more hereafter.<a name=126:10></a> If he, the apostle, counselled any member by the Spirit, woe be to that member if his counsel be despised.<a name=126:11></a> Of course, if he revealed a commandment of the Lord, the believer became directly responsible to the Lord for obedience to that commandment.<a name=126:12></a> And though he specially, and the whole Church, might judge by the Spirit, still it was always with this remembrance -- "another man's servant.<a name=126:13></a>"

		But, it must be distinctly remembered, this was not for private right or title in an individual.<a name=126:14></a> I recognise no such thing as right in an individual.<a name=126:15></a> Right, in the human sense of it, is some title to exercise his own will in man, unimpeded by the interference of another.<a name=126:16></a> <i>Now Christianity entirely sets this aside</i>.<a name=126:17></a> It may be very speciously maintained by dwelling only on the latter half of the definition, because grace does give a title against the interference of another; <i>but that title is in and by virtue of responsibility to God</i>.<a name=126:18></a> No man has a right to

		interfere with anything in which I am responsible to God.<a name=127:1></a> But the light which Christianity sheds on this is, not my meddling with the will of that other, but my obligation to do the will of God at all cost: "We ought to obey God rather than man.<a name=127:2></a>" And having first done the will of God, then to suffer for it; for it is better, if the will of God be so, to suffer for well-doing than for evildoing, for Christ, in the best sense, has once suffered for sins.<a name=127:3></a> If we do well, suffer for it, and take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.<a name=127:4></a> But this right in the individual, in the human and common force of it, Christianity cuts up by the root, because it pronounces the human will to be all wrong, and the assertion of its exercise to be <i>the principle of sin</i>; so that we "are <i>sanctified unto obedience</i>," as unto "the blood of sprinkling.<a name=127:5></a>" Thus the idea of all having <i>a right</i> to speak in the Church could never enter into the Christian mind.<a name=127:6></a> It has no place in the scheme of Christianity, which begins its moral existence by the breaking down the human will as evil.<a name=127:7></a> The Holy Spirit has the right, which He exercises sovereignly, of distributing "to every man severally <i>as he will</i>"; and hence responsibility subject to the purpose of the Holy Ghost in all.<a name=127:8></a> For the <i>manifestation</i> of the Spirit (which gifts are -- they are not the Holy Spirit itself) is given to every man to profit withal.<a name=127:9></a> There is purpose in it, to which the power of the Holy Ghost is to direct the use of these gifts for the good of all, as this epistle clearly shews us.<a name=127:10></a> The gifts to men or in man (both are used; one refers to Christ, the other to those to whom Christ gives them) are not <i>the</i> Holy Ghost, though they be <i>by</i> the Holy Ghost, and hence are guided by the mind of Christ, for the accomplishment of which they are given.<a name=127:11></a> Thus, to display the gift of tongues, or to use it where there were none to whom they applied, is described by the apostle to be the folly of childhood: they were given to profit withal.<a name=127:12></a> So also the spirits of the prophets -- the highest desirable gift -- were subject to the prophets.<a name=127:13></a> The not seeing this, and confounding these gifts of the Spirit in man with the Holy Ghost Himself, has led to much and mischievous confusion.<a name=127:14></a> And it has been thought impossible that they should ever be restrained, or subjected to even apostolic rule, turning, as every departure from scripture does, to the licence of the flesh and human will, or the even worse delusion of the enemy.<a name=127:15></a>

		Having spoken of the Spirit, and the Lord, and God; the first two shewing the relationship and power of this service, the last making us understand that it was withal truly God's power and working; and then in the same language (that the divinity of the Spirit might be recognized, though in a certain sense taking the place of service, as acting in the subject instrument of Christ's Lordship) ascribed the power and working to the Spirit: having cleared this point, the apostle takes up the subject in connection with the unity of the body.<a name=129:9></a> And here Christ, at least the body of Christ, becomes the subject of divine operations: first is rather the fruit of those operations; for we are by one Spirit baptized into one body -- thus is Christ.<a name=129:10></a> And the whole is spoken of as the subject of divine counsel; Christ only being the Head, and we in mutual dependence; but the whole sphere is looked at as a subject-scene of operations.<a name=129:11></a> It is not merely now the Holy Ghost bearing witness by which the world was convicted, or individuals convinced, and the Church gathered; but "now hath God set the members, every one of them in the body, as it hath

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have thus the operations of the Spirit of God formally established in the corporate unity of the body, in the various gifts of the different members, of which the Spirit itself formed the unity and the power; subservient to the lordship of Christ, and therefore directing the Church by His mind, whether for its own edification in love or testimony to the world; God setting the members of this body as it pleased Him.<a name=130:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The control of the Spirit, as communicating the mind of Christ, over the exercise of these entrusted powers is next brought forward -- after stating the superior excellence of love to any gift.<a name=130:6></a> Love was, and witnessed, God, and was the bond of perfectness in essential blessing.<a name=130:7></a> These, the testimony of power; prevailing indeed over evil, but still ministered in the midst of it, and not to continue, therefore, but to pass away or cease.<a name=130:8></a> The use of these <i>for the purpose of love</i> thus became the true test of grace and the mind of Christ in using them; otherwise, turned into personal display.<a name=130:9></a> The edifying of the Church was to be the rule of all used there, and no individual title, for they were to follow the mind of Christ.<a name=130:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This also gave rise to a distinction in the gifts, of those suited to the world, and those meant for the profit of the incumbent of the Church.<a name=130:11></a> Thus "tongues" were a sign to unbelievers, not to the Church; this was their use.<a name=130:12></a> One gifted with tongues was not therefore to speak in them, unless there was an interpreter; for the Church would not be edified: it would by the subject matter, if there was an interpreter.<a name=130:13></a> So "signs," or "miracles," confirmed the word.<a name=130:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The gift of tongues was peculiar and characteristically evangelical; overreaching the consequences of man's sin and judgment in Babel, and setting aside manifestly the confining the testimony of God to the Jewish people; constituting an active ministry towards those without, which was distinctively essential to Christianity.<a name=130:15></a> It thus became, distinctively, manifestative of the Holy Ghost, on the Jews, and on the Gentiles (the hundred and twenty and Cornelius), as sent down, the witness of this grace, and of glory and headship in Christ.<a name=130:16></a> Miracles had been wrought among the Jews; even there, however, it was amongst those departed from the covenant, or when at first that national system was established.<a name=130:17></a> In Judea

		the prophets recalled to the law, and let their predictions verify themselves or be owned by faith.<a name=131:1></a> Their summons to the law required no verification; its obligation was acknowledged.<a name=131:2></a> But tongues were properly applicable to the Christian dispensation as acting on the world, and therefore because the characteristic manifestation of the Holy Ghost sent down as acting before the world that needed this.<a name=131:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Tongues, miracles, healings," then, might be exercised by those gifted thereto in the Church, but they were exercised as the witness of the beneficence of Christ's Lordship to the world, and not towards the Church already alive in heaven by the deeper quickening power of that beneficence.<a name=131:4></a> This was their general character.<a name=131:5></a> The proper character of the Church's blessing was edification: "Let all things be done unto edifying"; or, as expressed in the Ephesians, "the edifying of itself in love.<a name=131:6></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This appears to me the true distinction: signs too to the world, and edification to the Church; not that usually made between miraculous, and not miraculous; as if God gave no positive gifts to the Church now, and as if <i>miraculous</i> were synonymous with <i>supernatural</i>, and that the Holy Ghost had ceased to act; and thus human powers are practically referred to as the sole agent in the Church.<a name=131:7></a> If miraculous be spoken of as meaning those which were signs to the world, I have no objection, provided the direct power and gift of the Holy Ghost be not set aside in those which are not for signs but for edifying: otherwise great dishonour is done to the Holy Ghost.<a name=131:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is this distinction given us in these gifts by the fact of some being for signs, some for edifying: the former are to act on the senses and mind as applicable to those without; the latter on conscience and spiritual understanding, and consequently the subject of intelligent judgment and reception.<a name=131:9></a> This remark is of importance.<a name=131:10></a> The Spirit of God acting in the force of responsibility in us is always paramount to any means of power and gift -- even if real; for, thereby the authority of God is owned and set up over ourselves.<a name=131:11></a> The true use of gift in the Church is just to enforce this: wherever it departs from this it is clearly false in principle.<a name=131:12></a> "I must judge them which say they are apostles" -- "let the rest judge" -- "the spiritual man judgeth all things.<a name=131:13></a>" Self-will, which refuses the enforcement of responsibility by gift, or which would use gift to exalt itself, instead of enforcing it, are alike the flesh set on by Satan

		to its own lawlessness.<a name=132:1></a> There is no remedy for this but grace, and the power and presence of the Holy Ghost condemning and mortifying the flesh in each.<a name=132:2></a> The want of this is recognized as possible, and to come, by the apostle: "The time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears.<a name=132:3></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I should also remark, that the Holy Ghost teaches us here that while He distributes to every man severally as He will, and uses whom He will, so that all openness is to be maintained for His operations, there are distinct permanent gifts whereby men are constituted teachers, prophets, or the like, though their teaching and prophesying may still be in constant dependence on the action of the Holy Ghost Himself.<a name=132:4></a> These directions, in fine, as to tongues and interpretations -- the number and manner of prophets speaking -- women speaking -- shew the distinct control of the Holy Ghost Himself (thus is its order expressed in the word) over the exercise of all entrusted gifts <i>in the Church</i>, where the Holy Ghost habitually dwelt and guided for the edifying of all.<a name=132:5></a> Liberty and guidance is characteristic of Christianity, and is distinctive of <i>power making willing</i>, and the wisdom <i>of God for us</i>.<a name=132:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This testimony to the world, and edifying of the Church, involves also another consideration, besides the signs wrought by the Church before the world -- a principle of service a little modified by the position of the apostle Paul -- that the operation of the Spirit in gift, though working in and by, precedes the formation of, the Church.<a name=132:7></a> Gift of evangelizing, though it be in a member of the Church, yet is clearly antecedent in its own character to the existence of the Church; for it is by that the Church is gathered.<a name=132:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The highest form of this was shewn in the apostles at Jerusalem, as we have already seen.<a name=132:9></a> And though the evangelist may go forth from the Church, and be aided by the Church, it is a gift exercised not towards the Church, or to its conscience, and of which the Church, therefore, cannot be properly cognizable.<a name=132:10></a> It must be exercised on the possession of the gift, and bears its evidence in its fruits, by acting in the primary work of God's Spirit on the conscience of the unconverted; judging it, not judged by it; coming in the grace and truth of Jesus to it.<a name=132:11></a> Other gifts, as prophesying, may convince others in conscience, but its exercise is <i>in the Church</i>, and the Church, having a conscience taught to the Spirit, is bound -- it may be

		through other prophets efficiently, but is bound -- to judge; but the evangelist is to the world, and there is no competency of judgment, though there may be holy counsel and advice, as from the Lord.<a name=133:1></a> As aiding in grace, temporally, the Church, or rather each individual in it -- be it a woman -- is bound to have no fellowship with doctrine not according to the word; and the Church should take all needful notice of this, and not be partakers of this sin.<a name=133:2></a> The same would apply as to any evil practice; but the exercise of the gift, as such, in its nature, though it flow from the midst of the Church, goes forth <i>out of it</i>, and, not referring to its conscience, does not raise a throne of judgment <i>there</i>, which responsibility to God does, in what is addressed to the Church.<a name=133:3></a> The evangelist is responsible to God for the exercise of his gift towards those without, and becomes <i>manifest in their consciences</i> in the sight of God.<a name=133:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The highest form of this was the apostles' on the day of Pentecost.<a name=133:5></a> It was a direct authoritative address, as the apostles of Jesus, appointed by Him, and ratified in power by the Holy Ghost to the world, thereby forming the Church, and becoming, in a certain subordinate sense, heads of the Church, to guide, regulate, order, and direct those whom they so gathered, which gave the subsequent character to apostolic office.<a name=133:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus <i>the evangelist</i> becomes, in a certain sense, independent of the Church, though <i>the man</i> be always subject to it; and though the ministry of evangelization be in the Church, yet the Church is not properly missionary, nor the manager of missions.<a name=133:7></a> It is "a city set on a hill," formed by missions from God.<a name=133:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The sense of this position of the evangelist I believe to be most healthful to the Church, keeping it in its place and from assuming the place of God as if it were the sender.<a name=133:9></a> It is gathered, and does not send: God sends; though, in love, those whom He sends may go forth from its bosom.<a name=133:10></a> This was clear in the first apostles: "As my Father hath sent me, so send I you," was the Lord's word to them.<a name=133:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But this was true of ministers of this character, inferior in rank to the apostles, and of the whole body when under this character -- a character assumedly this, as "<i>scattered</i>," not "<i>gathered</i>"; as "<i>going</i>," not "sending.<a name=133:12></a>" They that were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the word, and the hand of the Lord was with them, and many believed.<a name=133:13></a> Nay, before this, Stephen (of whom we may perhaps say, he had

		gotten to himself a good degree and great boldness in Christ Jesus), full of the Holy Ghost, was mighty in the word.<a name=134:1></a> Philip in like manner was blessed in Samaria, which, when the apostles heard, they sent Peter and John to confirm the work; but the work was done before they even heard of it.<a name=134:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is the character then attached to evangelizing in the word.<a name=134:3></a> The weakening of it in individual energy will always weaken that and the Church too; for God will be independent of man, though he cannot be of Him, nor of his neighbour in love.<a name=134:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I said this was a little modified in Paul, yet withal clearly sustained in principle.<a name=134:5></a> But he went out as one born out of due time -- after the body was formed, in a certain sense.<a name=134:6></a> This, therefore, was recognized; not in sending him, but in his going forth from it and returning to it, whence he had been commended to the grace of God.<a name=134:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The positive independence of his mission he is most careful to assert.<a name=134:8></a> "It was not of man, nor by man.<a name=134:9></a>" Immediately Christ was revealed in him that he might preach Him among the Gentiles, he conferred not with flesh and blood, but straightway preached Him in the synagogues.<a name=134:10></a> Thus the character of this ministry was fully maintained.<a name=134:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But after a lapse of time Paul comes from Tarsus, brought to Antioch, and there for a year assembles himself with the Christian congregation, and teaches much people; and then "the Holy Ghost," certain prophets being there, while they fasted and prayed, "said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.<a name=134:12></a>" Thus, while directly sent of the Holy Ghost, they went in obedience to Him, not to the Church; they went from the bosom of the Church, commended of them to the grace of God for the work whereunto He had called them, and returned to the bosom of the Church.<a name=134:13></a> Not returning any intermediate reports indeed as responsible to them, for the true apostolic office would thereby have been detracted from; but communicating for the joy of all what God had done through them.<a name=134:14></a> Thus, though it was not a gift exercised in ministry in the Church, its union with the Church was maintained, and the comfort of all sustained therein.<a name=134:15></a> The apostle became -- authoritatively sent amongst those whom he had himself thus gathered -- the apostle of the Gentiles.<a name=134:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have said thus much of evangelization, because, though not a sign to the world, but a ministry flowing in the Church, it was still towards the world, and came in a special place in the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is the real difference of this epistle to the Ephesians and that to the Corinthians.<a name=135:9></a> There the Spirit is looked at as present, and operating in the body generally, in the power of <i>God</i>, "as God hath set in the Church" -- witness of, and subservient to, the Lordship of Christ, and therefore including that in which it was the witness of this to the world; and therefore the gift in its exercise is dependent in many respects on the competency of the Church by its state to stand as a witness, or the wisdom of God in so using it.<a name=135:10></a> Here (in the Ephesians) the state of the Church is not adverted to.<a name=135:11></a> It is not its internal administration that is the subject, but Christ's own love to His own body, His spouse; one he cherished and nourished as His own flesh, and thus cherished and nourished for Himself.<a name=135:12></a> Hence we have Christ, who loved the Church, viewed as ascending up on high and filling all things, giving the gifts; and it is said -- not the Spirit works as He will in power, but (while the same unity is spoken of, though more of blessing than of membership) "to every one is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.<a name=135:13></a>" This, then, is not the witness of the power of God above the flesh and its ruin, and the Lordship of Christ; but of the love of Christ and the ministration of that, and of the counsels of God, as to the place He has given the Church with Christ; it had, therefore, a more permanent character; for Christ's love to the Church is permanent, not resting on the suitableness of the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Perhaps it may be said that the evil state of the Corinthian Church shews it was not a ministration of gift dependent <i>in any way on that state</i>; for these, so evil, came "behind in no gift.<a name=136:5></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It shews, indeed, that our patient God does not withdraw the honour conferred by His goodness at once on shortcoming; but the principle is exactly shewn by it.<a name=136:6></a> The Church, still in unity, though having failed in practice, is corrected by the apostle in all points, shewing the importance of the apostolic energy which still sustained it, that its safeguard was not mere primary position; but while it held its place, though falling into evil, it could be restored by that and all go right -- Satan not be allowed to get advantage after all.<a name=136:7></a> But still this was just the evidence that the state and administration of the Church was in question, not the self-moved tender love of Christ to it, caring for it as His spouse; it stands in Corinth as the responsible witness of His glory, not the fulness of Him that filleth all in all.<a name=136:8></a> In Ephesians it is the blessed and holy privilege of grace, not the condition of the Church itself, which is in question as the ground and theatre of the display of Christ towards the world.<a name=136:9></a> It is what Christ is towards the Church, not what the Church is for Him, or what God has set it in its Head and body, towards the world around it.<a name=136:10></a> It is "till <i>we all</i> come.<a name=136:11></a>" Hence, as the special personal care and love of Christ for the Church, it is not "the Comforter whom the Father will send in my name" -- nor, "whom I will send unto you from the Father" -- nor even members which God has set in the body subservient to the Lordship of Christ; but gifts which He, ascending up on high, has given, on leading the adverse powers captive.<a name=136:12></a> He who fills all things has given these the tokens of the nearness of His love -- "that he might fill all things," and "he gave.<a name=136:13></a>"

		It is to be remarked that all <i>gifts of sign</i> to men as such are entirely omitted; <i>all</i> that dealt with nature, and <i>all</i> even that merely dealt with the flesh in the Church; those only are mentioned that are initiative, and that edify in the Church.<a name=139:8></a> Thus miracles, tongues, healings, helps, and governments are omitted; apostles and evangelists, prophets, pastors, and teachers are introduced.<a name=139:9></a>

		But, moreover, it is clear to me that, in a subordinate sense, apostles and prophets had a place beside this.<a name=140:14></a> That the apostles expected no continuance of their functions is clear, for the apostle Paul declares the evil that would come in after his decease, and commends them to God and the word of His grace; and Peter says he will take care that they have the things in remembrance.<a name=140:15></a> And, indeed, one familiar with the New Testament will see that the character of the Church's responsibility is founded on the departure of direct apostolic authoritative care.<a name=140:16></a> The Church could not leave it to them as the complete competent authority, who had communicated the Lord's will, and before whose departure the Lord began to act in judgment, if equally authorized communicators were constantly with the same authority present in the Church.<a name=140:17></a> The casting a dispensation on responsibility of a given deposit would have been entirely set aside, that is, the whole principle of God's dealing to the end, and the assumptions clearly taken up by the apostles falsified, and the Bible set aside, by a constant succession of equally authoritative communications.<a name=140:18></a> For the

		We find that, in one sense, apostolic ministry precedes the Church, the Church being gathered by it.<a name=141:2></a> Its character being, then, gathering by the authoritative revelation of the will of Christ (as the testimony to Christ in the power of the Spirit, whether by themselves or others, draws and quickens souls).<a name=141:3></a> Under this evangelists came, another testimony of their gift being of God, and that He could in His sovereignty communicate important parts of it to others; but apostolic service found its place also in the Church, where the participated evangelist's gift did not (that is the regulating authoritatively the gathered, according to that revealed will).<a name=141:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But, as has been elsewhere stated, a new principle was introduced in and even before the apostolate of Paul, on the dispersion of the order of the Church at Jerusalem -- <i>individual agency</i> according to the energy of the Spirit, according to its measure, the operation proving itself and its own efficacy.<a name=141:5></a> So even the apostle of this owns: "The signs of an apostle were wrought in me"; "Make full proof of thy ministry"; "Let no man despise thee.<a name=141:6></a>" Hence, though subsisting not in authoritative revelation of the will of God, nor power in the Church, in a subordinate sense, it seems to me that the gift of apostle and prophet has not passed away.<a name=141:7></a> Barnabas was an apostle: Junius and Andronicus were of note among the apostles: and it was praise to a church that they had tried certain whether they were apostles, and they were not, but liars.<a name=141:8></a> Doubtless, these pretenders set up for the highest form of apostolate.<a name=141:9></a> But the Church could not have been commended for trying them, if there had been question only of the twelve and Paul.<a name=141:10></a> In truth, the word 'apostle,' though now of definite force, has it not properly; it just amounts to one sent, a missionary.<a name=141:11></a> The messenger of the Church is called "your apostle," in the original.<a name=141:12></a>

		That which seems to designate the character of apostle, is the being directly sent of Christ, raised up to act on his own personal responsibility to Christ; not merely a gift exercised on such or such occasion subject to church rules, nor the going forth with good tidings to sinners; but as one sent by Christ, acting from Him on his own responsibility to Christ, having a given errand and sphere in which to exercise his commission.<a name=141:13></a> In this sense, while the authoritative primary revelation of

		God's will, gathering and regulating the Church, has clearly closed in the scriptural record to apostolic ministry, I do not see but that apostolic service may still subsist, and probably has been exercised, though the name may not have been attached; men raised up and sent by God for a certain mission, to effect a certain result in the Church, or on sinners, though with no fresh revelation, but with a special energy in which to fulfil it, beyond the bounds of mere circumscribed gift as members within, but special in its relation to Christ.<a name=142:1></a> The faithfulness of its accomplishment, the mixing of other things with it, or the failure in clearly following in particular instances, does not, it seems to me, touch this question.<a name=142:2></a> In the same way, prophets, who were associated with apostles as the foundation, because they revealed the mind of God, may, it appears to me, in a subordinate sense, be believed to exist.<a name=142:3></a> It is not that they now reveal fresh truths not contained in the word (or the foundation would not be completely laid -- this, I hold, never can be touched), but that there may be those who not merely teach and explain ordinary and profitable doctrine -- truths, and guide by the Spirit into present truth, but who by a special energy of the Spirit can unfold and communicate the mind of Christ to the Church where it is ignorant of it (though that mind be treasured up in the scripture) -- can bring truths, hidden previously from the knowledge of the Church, in the power of the testimony of the Spirit of God, to bear on the present circumstances of the Church and future prospects of the world, shewing the things to come; only that these things are all actually treasured up in Scripture, but they can give them present application and force according to the mind, intention, and power of God, and thus be <i>practically</i> prophets (though there be no new facts revealed, but all are really in the word already), and thus be a direct blessing and gift of Christ to the Church for its emergency and need, though the word be strictly adhered to, but without which the Church would not have had the power of that word.<a name=142:4></a>

		This makes, I trust, this point, and the sense in which there may be, in a subordinate and inferior sense, apostles and (in a nearer sense to their original character) prophets, now clear.<a name=143:9></a> Revelation of new, unknown, and unrevealed truths being quite excluded, prophets, as expressing the mind of God, could speak, and did, to exhortation, and edification, and comfort, in thus applying the mind of God to the saints.<a name=143:10></a> So did the prophets of highest character of old.<a name=143:11></a>

		These were the ministrations: the first two (apostles and prophets) being in their primary sense the foundation-extraordinary; the last three (evangelists, pastors, and teachers), the ordinary abiding ministrations of the Church, to build them up in Christ's known and thus ministered fulness; that the body of Christ might be edified, "grow up into him.<a name=144:10></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The primary and full object was the perfecting of the saints -- their being formed and fashioned according to the pattern of this fulness and into it; but there was a formal and instrumental object as the medium of this.<a name=144:11></a> As to this in its twofold character, the Greek preposition is changed, and the article omitted: "for [<i>pros</i>] the perfecting of the saints; with a view to [<i>eis</i>] the work of the ministry with a view to [<i>eis</i>] the edifying of the body of Christ," <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:12">Ephesians  4:12</a>.<a name=144:12></a> This ministerial work was clearly merely ancillary, and the edifying the body of Christ, for the perfect enjoyment of the fulness by the saints, "for the perfecting of the saints," is the direct and positive object.<a name=144:13></a> The other two were the service and form of blessing in which this object was carried on, and to which, therefore, these gifts were directed for the other, till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to full-grown men -- to a perfect man -- to the measure of the stature, in mind and in blessing, of the fulness of Christ, of which we have before

		This leads us to see the blessing and importance of these gifts, definitely committed by Christ, as He sees good in grace, for the good and communication of His blessed fulness to the Church; whereby, fed with what is good, it should be preserved and guarded against hankering after the false trash of deceivers.<a name=145:2></a> They are gifts to the Church, not to all, but for all.<a name=145:3></a> The development of these in full liberty and openness of ministry is most important.<a name=145:4></a> Nor can they be really or rightly developed otherwise.<a name=145:5></a> Hence God has commanded -- made it a matter of command, and thus guarded the closing of the door by making it a matter of personal responsibility -- that he that exhorteth shall wait on exhortation, and he that teacheth on teaching; and, "as every man has received the gift, so minister the same as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.<a name=145:6></a>" So "Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves," exhorted the people much at Antioch.<a name=145:7></a> By this use of every gift in its place as the apostle speaks, "the whole body is fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth," and, "according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body to the edifying of itself in love.<a name=145:8></a>" Still, observe, these ministrations are all to the edifying and increase of the body, not to the external testimony of Christ's Lordship to the world.<a name=145:9></a> They are the fulfilling of His love to the Church, in ministering to it of, and so building it up into, His fulness -- not the verification of the assertion of His Lordship to the world.<a name=145:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The only other reference of importance, that I am aware of, as to distinctness of subject, is in the book of Revelation, which I shall only briefly notice, because its character is quite different.<a name=145:11></a> In the first three chapters, the unity of the body ceases to be recognized, and the Spirit is not seen acting in the Church in the power of this unity, of which Christ is the corporate Head; but Christ is seen in a judicial though priestly character in the midst of the churches, and the Spirit is a Spirit of address and prophetic warning to them, not of gift in them.<a name=145:12></a> "He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.<a name=145:13></a>" This might be gift in the apostle, but this is the character of the address; and hence every individual with an ear is called upon to hear for himself.<a name=145:14></a>

		Many have, perhaps, been able, in looking at the Church's hope in Christ, to see the importance of the doctrine of the resurrection.<a name=147:1></a> But the more we search the Scriptures, the more we perceive, in this doctrine, the fundamental truth of the gospel -- that truth which gives to redemption its character, and to all other truths their real power.<a name=147:2></a> For instance, who does not know that Christianity has its root and its foundation in that solemn and all-important event, the death of our blessed Saviour?<a name=147:3></a> But if it had been possible that death could have held the Saviour in his power, death, instead of being the foundation of joy, and the certainty of salvation, would have been the source of a black despair which nothing could have dissipated.<a name=147:4></a>

God has separated from existing evil to Himself, and then given a variety of directions to keep the so separated person in practical separation. See, as to Israel's sanctification, @Leviticus 20: 24-26. Sanctification now is God's separation of individuals from the world unto Himself in Christ, so that those so separated are "not of the world, even as Christ was not of the world."

		There is a passage in the Scriptures which has struck me much on this subject, and which conveys a special instruction on the difference there is between viewing the resurrection as an event common to the Church and the world, or as a privilege which belongs separately to the Church in consequence of the power of the life which is in Christ.<a name=159:3></a> I speak of <a href="../bible/John.htm#11">John  11</a>.<a name=159:4></a> Jesus says to Martha, "Thy brother shall rise again.<a name=159:5></a> Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.<a name=159:6></a>" Here is real faith, a truth she had well learnt.<a name=159:7></a> She was not a Sadducee.<a name=159:8></a> This is the faith of the Church generally; "He will rise again at the last day.<a name=159:9></a>" Without doubt.<a name=159:10></a> The same thing might be said of the most wicked man.<a name=159:11></a> "Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live; and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.<a name=159:12></a> Believest thou this?<a name=159:13></a> -- that is, the power of Jesus when present, the power which He will manifest when He comes again.<a name=159:14></a> "She saith unto him, Yea, Lord; I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.<a name=159:15></a>" Here again is a good confession: those who are saved doubtless believe it also.<a name=159:16></a> But here, in fact, the faith of the greatest part of the Church stops.<a name=159:17></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With respect to the dispensations of God, the resurrection is the fundamental subject of the word of God, since sin and death entered into the world, and sin reigns unto death.<a name=161:4></a> If sin reigns unto death, then resurrection only can be the victory over it; and it is a complete and final victory.<a name=161:5></a> For he that is dead is freed or justified from sin.<a name=161:6></a> "Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him; knowing that Christ, being raised from the dead, dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him," <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:7">Romans  6:7</a>-9.<a name=161:7></a> Throughout the Scriptures we find this truth more or less fully disclosed -- the foundation of every hope <i>and</i> of all moral judgment.<a name=161:8></a> (See <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#17">Psalm  17</a>, 49; <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#38">Isaiah  38</a>.<a name=161:9></a>) And even the restoration of the Jewish people is described as a resurrection.<a name=161:10></a> (See <a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#37">Ezekiel  37</a>; <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#26">Isaiah  26</a>.<a name=161:11></a>) There is the source of joy, as in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16">Psalm  16</a>, <a href="../bible/@Job.htm#19">@Job  19</a>.<a name=161:12></a> And it was a truth so positive -- a notion so necessary to the thoughts of God and of His righteous ones, that when God said, "I am the God of Abraham," the Lord explains it as shewing that Abraham was to be raised; for "God is not the God of the dead, but of the living," <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#22:32">Matthew  22:32</a>.<a name=161:13></a> I said that one thing only remained.<a name=161:14></a>

		It is generally thought that <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#20">Revelation  20</a>is the only support which the word of God gives to the notion of a separate resurrection of the Church.<a name=161:15></a> We have already seen that this idea is connected with all the truths in the word of God.<a name=161:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="paragraph">
		The main object of this tract is to establish the true meaning of certain texts, which, as experience proves, have been the occasion of much difficulty to sincere Christians.<a name=164:1></a> With this view the form of a dialogue has been adopted.<a name=164:2></a> In fact, certain conversations, of which this is a summary, gave occasion to the undertaking.<a name=164:3></a> That form seemed most favourable to the statement of objections, and of the texts brought forward.<a name=164:4></a> Whatever of importance has been advanced from the word is here answered; it is hoped that nothing of that kind has been passed over.<a name=164:5></a> It has struck us, that the best reply to the entire work, which contains many of the arguments it was judged necessary to meet, is to be found in the character and tone of that work itself<a href="#164:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>.<a name=164:6></a> It appeared, therefore, essential to confine ourselves to warning simple-minded believers against the way in which God's word is therein quoted.<a name=164:7></a> This, in fact, is all that we have done.<a name=164:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One important remark, omitted in what follows, may be here introduced.<a name=164:9></a> The source whence John Wesley derived this doctrine was by no means the Bible; he himself honestly confessed it.<a name=164:10></a> He believed the Bible <i>confirmed</i> his ideas, but he did not derive them thence.<a name=164:11></a> He learned them from Bishop Taylor, Law, and Thomas à-Kempis.<a name=164:12></a> It was not till four years after he had studied the first of these writers, and while he was still deeply imbued with his doctrines, that he took the <i>Bible</i> as the sole standard of truth.<a name=164:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thomas à-Kempis is well known by his work on the imitation of Christ.<a name=164:14></a> He was a Catholic, who, as far as he had light, was pious; but in whose writings the cross of Christ scarcely once

		Law and Taylor, though nominally Protestants, were much his inferiors; they were less humble, and, if possible, yet more ignorant of the gospel.<a name=165:3></a> Both of them were mystics: Taylor was likewise very superstitious; and neither the one nor the other had the slightest conception of grace.<a name=165:4></a> No one charges them with insincerity; but no instructed Christian who has read their works doubts their utter ignorance of the gospel.<a name=165:5></a> Such are the three sources whence John Wesley acknowledged he first derived the doctrine which he has introduced into the Church.<a name=165:6></a> Their influence is easily perceptible in his ideas of perfection.<a name=165:7></a> We shall see that in the exposition which he gives of his doctrine, there is not so much as an allusion to the love of God to us.<a name=165:8></a>

		A. Softly, my dear friend.<a name=166:2></a> You have brought forward so many things at once, that it will take a little time to answer you.<a name=166:3></a> As to the fruits you refer to, I must differ from you; I suspect such boasting.<a name=166:4></a> I readily admit that there are many dear Christians among the Wesleyans; and then, the Church of Christ in general is, at the present time, in such weakness: there is so little liberty and joy; there is, in my judgment, such glaring deficiency in the manner of presenting the gospel, that I am not surprised that many are led away by a doctrine which promises something better.<a name=166:5></a> By a freer testimony, for example, of the love of God for sinners; by presenting, more decidedly, Christ as the means of deliverance, it may in some degree supply the deficiencies in the present style of preaching.<a name=166:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		N. But how can good be done by a doctrine which, taken as a whole, is false?<a name=166:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A. I will tell you.<a name=166:8></a> They say, "We ought not to seek <i>sanctification</i> by human effort; but that by receiving Christ as our sanctification the germ of sin is destroyed, and we are perfectly holy, and without sin or evil concupiscence.<a name=166:9></a>" It is true that we shall never, by any strength or effort of man, attain to sanctification; and that if we look to Christ, we shall find an abundant spring of life and holiness.<a name=166:10></a> I grant also that a soul which is under the law, and groaning beneath the burden of its wretchedness, will get no blessing by useless struggles for deliverance.<a name=166:11></a> But all this does not hinder the doctrine, as a whole, being false.<a name=166:12></a> For it is false to say, that by receiving Christ as our sanctification we can ever, on earth, attain to perfection, and extirpate entirely sin from our nature.<a name=166:13></a> It is an error which connects itself with a host of other errors, destructive of the most precious truths and consolations of the gospel; and which injures, in a high degree, our sanctification itself.<a name=166:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		N. But how can it injure sanctification?<a name=166:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A. Before I answer, let me briefly state my judgment as to the history of Wesleyanism.<a name=166:16></a> The ruinous condition of the Church, a century ago, gave rise, through divine grace, to a remarkable movement.<a name=166:17></a> Some truly devoted men felt impelled to preach, and to call men to repentance.<a name=166:18></a> But instead of adhering to the word, certain of them framed for themselves a system of doctrines and discipline -- doctrines which, while admitting salvation by Jesus, have put aside many of the most

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=167>[Page 167]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		precious truths in connection with it -- a discipline admirably suited, in a worldly point of view, like that of the Jesuits, for the aggrandisement of their society (for indeed it is a society, not a church), but in the highest degree injurious to the souls of men.<a name=167:1></a> I am perfectly convinced that Christians who are not members of their body, but who well know them, will not be found to confirm the testimony which the Wesleyans bear to themselves.<a name=167:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us now turn to the doctrine of God's word.<a name=167:3></a> I observe, in the outset, that the reproach which you have learned to cast upon preachers of the gospel does not appear to me to be a fruit of the Spirit of God -- when you say, for example, that such persons preach <i>sin</i>.<a name=167:4></a> Do you believe, then, that all who have not received the doctrines of Wesley love or preach sin?<a name=167:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		N. Not exactly so: but you say a Christian will go on sinning to the end, and that it is death which delivers us from sin.<a name=167:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A. My dear friend, that is not what I say, but this: that the root of sin will remain in us until we are dislodged from the body, or until we are changed, because we expect the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:23">Romans  8:23</a>), which has not yet taken place.<a name=167:7></a> But I do not say that we ought to walk according to this evil principle: quite the contrary; we ought to walk "in the Spirit," although "the flesh" still exists.<a name=167:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		N. I do not understand what you mean by the flesh.<a name=167:9></a> It is said (<a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#5:23">1 Thessalonians  5:23</a>), "May the God of peace sanctify you wholly, body, soul, and spirit.<a name=167:10></a> God is faithful, who also will do it.<a name=167:11></a>" Now what is there more in man than body, soul, and spirit?<a name=167:12></a> And if we ought always to walk in the Spirit (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#5:16">Galatians  5:16</a>), then it follows that we are disputing about words.<a name=167:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A. By no means; for the moment you affirm that we can be perfect, and that there is no longer sin in you, a multitude of things, which the word of God calls sin, cease to be so in your estimation.<a name=167:14></a> The contrast between your condition and that of Jesus Christ becomes less sensible to your mind.<a name=167:15></a> You attenuate sin.<a name=167:16></a> Real sanctification suffers in proportion, and the distinction between sin and sins is entirely lost sight of.<a name=167:17></a> It is because your doctrine attenuates the idea of sin; because it does away with the rule, and lowers the standard, of sanctification, that I oppose it with all my might.<a name=167:18></a> This is no difference on a point of knowledge or speculation merely, but involves the

		A. I have not forgotten them; they are the least tenable points of your doctrine; and prove that it is entirely contrary to the truth and the holiness of God; for you thereby attenuate holiness on the one hand, and sin on the other, by not properly taking God into the account.<a name=177:7></a> You say, "Be ye holy, as God who hath called you is holy," <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:15">1 Peter  1:15</a>, 16.<a name=177:8></a> But the passage reads, "Be ye holy, <i>for</i> he is holy.<a name=177:9></a>" Now <i>every</i> Christian acknowledges the force of this exhortation.<a name=177:10></a> I repeat, therefore, that to cite such passages in proof of a state of perfection in <i>certain</i> Christians, is to throw dust into the eyes of the simple: for you very well know that no one is holy <i>as</i> God is holy.<a name=177:11></a> In fact, when I examine what you mean by being "perfect, as your Father which is in heaven is perfect," and "holy as God is holy," I find that in your opinion the most pious are guilty of errors, which are departures from the perfect law, and require the atoning efficacy of the blood of Christ, without which they would be exposed to eternal condemnation<a href="#177:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>.<a name=177:12></a> But pray tell me, what you mean by being perfect as our Father who is in heaven is perfect, if the most pious do things which, but for the blood of Christ, would expose them to eternal condemnation.<a name=177:13></a> Could we have believed, if we had not had it before our eyes, that any one would be found to affirm, that a man who does things deserving eternal condemnation, is nevertheless sinless, and the germ of sin so entirely eradicated that he is perfect as his Father who is in heaven is perfect?<a name=177:14></a> And if it is said there is a divine perfection to which neither man nor angel can attain, why mock us by pretensions which are afterwards reduced to so low a standard?<a name=177:15></a> You say that a perfect man has all the sentiments of Jesus Christ, and that he always walks as Jesus walked,<a href="#177:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a> yet the most pious do things

		A. I know very well that these words occur in the Scriptures; but the use you would make of them is to persuade us that there are Christians who are without sin, perfectly purified from all sin, and clear from the existence of sin in their nature.<a name=178:6></a> But the word of God does not make use of these expressions to this end.<a name=178:7></a> When it is said, "Be ye perfect, as your Father which is in heaven is perfect" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#5:48">Matthew  5:48</a>), Jesus Himself explains the passage by that which precedes it.<a name=178:8></a> This perfection consists in acting according to love, and not according to the law of retaliation, which says, "An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth"; it is to act towards men, according to the principle of the divine conduct towards us, according to the grace of our heavenly Father.<a name=178:9></a> There is no allusion here to the root of sin in our nature.<a name=178:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The word perfection is employed with reference to the three great revelations of God.<a name=178:11></a> For He made Himself known to Abraham as "the Almighty," to the Jews as "the Lord [Jehovah]," and to Christians as "the Father.<a name=178:12></a>" God said to Abraham, "I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#17:1">Genesis  17:1</a>); which means, that he was to walk before God, always confiding in His almighty power.<a name=178:13></a> Abraham did not so, he failed in this respect; for he told a lie (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#20:2">Genesis  20:2</a>), precisely because he did not confide in God's almighty power.<a name=178:14></a> Here, again, the passage has no reference to the sin which had descended to Abraham by nature; but it has to do with his acting in full confidence in the almighty power of God.<a name=178:15></a> In point of fact, Abraham still had sin, and therefore had a fall.<a name=178:16></a> It is said to the Israelites, "Thou shalt be perfect with the Lord [Jehovah] thy God," <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#18:13">Deuteronomy  18:13</a>.<a name=178:17></a> Now this referred to their not imitating the abominations of the Canaanites in their idolatries; and not at all to the state of purification from all sin of this or that Israelite.<a name=178:18></a> The contrary is so true, that in the same book (<a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#29:4">Deuteronomy  29:4</a>) Moses tells them, "Yet the Lord hath not given you a heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day.<a name=178:19></a>" It referred,

	</div>

		A. Why, then, did you cite these passages, as though they supported this doctrine of perfection?<a name=179:4></a> But I turn now to the third passage: "Be ye perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect," <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#5:48">Matthew  5:48</a>.<a name=179:5></a> Observe there is a difference in the expression.<a name=179:6></a> It is not said, Be ye perfect before me, or, with thy God, as it had been said to Abraham and to the Israelites; because the name of <i>Father</i> reveals to us the fulness of grace.<a name=179:7></a> According to that precious name we are already children, accepted in Christ as Christ is accepted by the Father; we are already made acceptable in the Beloved, righteous before God as Jesus Christ is righteous, loved as Jesus Christ is loved.<a name=179:8></a> Now it is not said, Present to God a character of <i>perfection</i>, so that by this means ye may be accepted and made well-pleasing to Him; but, Ye are the children of your heavenly Father: shew forth, therefore, His character in the world; "for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good; and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.<a name=179:9></a>" He acts according to <i>grace</i>, and not according to law; ye saved sinners, ye are the proof of it; be His witnesses.<a name=179:10></a> The publicans love those who love them, but your Father loves His enemies.<a name=179:11></a> Act by this rule; and "be ye perfect, as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.<a name=179:12></a>" It is not said, Be ye perfect with Him, or before Him (as though you were <i>without sin</i>), but as He, act in love towards your enemies.<a name=179:13></a> I therefore repeat, that the question here is, not whether or not sin is in the flesh, but what is that principle which ought to regulate the conduct of the children of God, in contrast with the principle of law or of natural justice.<a name=179:14></a> But if by being "perfect as my heavenly Father" is to be understood the absence of <i>sin</i> from my nature -- if it really means that I am perfectly to resemble Him in this respect, then, as <i>perfection</i> in us, according to you, still leaves things which expose us to eternal condemnation, it would be the same with the perfection of God -- an impiety and absurdity too gross to delay us for a moment!<a name=179:15></a>

		Finally, the passage which you have cited, "As he is, so are we in this world" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:17">1 John  4:17</a>), is something quite different from what you would make of it.<a name=181:12></a> In the first place, the reference is to <i>Christ</i> and not to God.<a name=181:13></a> It is said in chapter 3: 3 of the same epistle, "Every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.<a name=181:14></a>" And what is this hope?<a name=181:15></a> It is that, "we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is" (verse 2).<a name=181:16></a> Thus, "as He is," is to be as <i>Jesus</i> is now in glory, and not as He was, which is never said in the word.<a name=181:17></a> Now it is certain that, in our present <i>state</i>, we are not <i>as He is</i>.<a name=181:18></a> If we examine the whole of this passage (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:17">1 John  4:17</a>) attentively, we shall clearly see what the Holy Spirit designs to teach us.<a name=181:19></a> It is said (verse 9), "In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.<a name=181:20></a>" And in verse 17, "Herein is love perfected with us, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.<a name=181:21></a>" Now love perfected with us does not make us say,

	<div class="paragraph">
		So that we may be such in ourselves; but, "that we may <i>have boldness</i> in the day of judgment.<a name=182:1></a>" And what gives us this boldness?<a name=182:2></a> It is that God has <i>manifested</i> His love in sending His Son into the world; and He has finished or <i>perfected</i> this love by putting us into Christ Himself before His face, and that in the power of the life in which He lives, and by union with Him through the Holy Ghost who dwells in us.<a name=182:3></a> United to Him, even while here below, we (<i>in this world</i>) are not what He is personally in the glory, but perfectly <i>as He is before God</i>, and that by a real union, which communicates His life to us, and makes us to be accepted in the Beloved.<a name=182:4></a> We are loved as He is loved; righteous as He is righteous.<a name=182:5></a> In principle and in hope we are made partakers of His glory.<a name=182:6></a> And this life is imparted to us here below, so that we walk in it in the certainty of being accepted as Christ is accepted and loved as He is loved.<a name=182:7></a> Whoso touches us touches Him, and Himself can say, speaking of <i>us</i>, "Why persecutest thou <i>me</i>?<a name=182:8></a>" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:4">Acts  9:4</a>).<a name=182:9></a> God, in Christ, manifests His love toward man; but man, in Christ, is presented to God in the perfectness of Christ's acceptance, and he has the enjoyment of it in the nature which has been communicated to him, and by which he participates in it.<a name=182:10></a> The nature which we have received is the nature of Christ Himself.<a name=182:11></a> It manifests itself in our walking according to its own principles.<a name=182:12></a> Yes, we are partakers of the divine nature: we are one with the last Adam.<a name=182:13></a> But then this nature does not change the old man, but judges him in all his thoughts and in all his ways.<a name=182:14></a>

		N.

In one sense that is true; but that, by no means, establishes the principle upon which you lay so much stress, that God commands <i>nothing but</i> what may be accomplished.<a name=184:9></a> The law was given to man in the flesh, and the New Testament teaches me, very clearly, that God did not give the law in the thought that man <i>could keep it</i>.<a name=184:10></a> The carnal mind pretends to do so; but the word tells me that the law of God was given to convince man of sin, by the discovery that he did not keep it, so "that sin might become by the commandment exceeding sinful.<a name=184:11></a>" The law entered, says the apostle, that <i>the offence might abound</i>.<a name=184:12></a> Sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence.<a name=184:13></a> For without the law sin is dead; <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7:8">Romans  7:8</a>.<a name=184:14></a> Remark here, in passing, that sin produces concupiscence or lust.<a name=184:15></a> When the law had said, Thou shalt not covet, then Paul knew sin.<a name=184:16></a> "The strength of sin is the law," says the same apostle elsewhere; <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:56">1 Corinthians  15:56</a>.<a name=184:17></a> I gather, therefore, that in giving the law, God's purpose was to convince man of the sin which is in him; and not, as you say, with the thought that man could and would keep it.<a name=184:18></a>

		A. I have already begged of you always to read the context before you receive a passage as having such a sense or such a bearing; and in order that you may ascertain the meaning of the Holy Spirit.<a name=196:4></a> For example, there is no reference in this passage to the state of sanctification, but to the advancing in <i>knowledge</i>.<a name=196:5></a> Paul, therein, draws a contrast between the principles of the doctrine of Christ (such as a believing Jew might have understood them before the day of Pentecost), and that knowledge which the Holy Ghost gives of the fulness of the glory of the Son of man exalted above all.<a name=196:6></a>

		I add one remark in connection with this passage.<a name=196:7></a> You will find at the end of the preceding chapter (verse 13, 14) that milk is suited to babes, but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age.<a name=196:8></a> This character of men of full age is expressed in the original by the word which is generally rendered <i>perfect</i>.<a name=196:9></a> For, in Greek, the word <i>perfect</i> signifies also one of full age.<a name=196:10></a> To quote all the passages where the word "perfect" occurs is really a mere waste of words.<a name=196:11></a> The expression is most frequently applied to the state of a man who has fully apprehended the whole extent of the truth which is in Christ, both as regards the privileges and the conduct of Christians, which full apprehension leads us to the conviction of our state of imperfection.<a name=196:12></a> Therefore, when Paul says, "As many of us as be perfect," he adds in the same passage, "I count not myself to have apprehended.<a name=196:13></a>" Jesus Christ had apprehended him for the resurrection of the dead.<a name=196:14></a> Having learned the purpose of Jesus, Paul pressed towards the mark, and, by so doing, acknowledged the imperfection of his actual condition.<a name=196:15></a> I might lay down that the ordinary sense of the word 'perfect' in the Greek, is to have reached our full stature in Christ, without any reference to the presence or the absence of sin.<a name=196:16></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As you have yourself referred to this pamphlet, I have some further remarks to make upon it.<a name=198:12></a> You may observe, in the first place, the way in which the question is stated: it is not at all the love of God for us.<a name=198:13></a> The perfecting of love and the accomplishment of love are nowhere in it presented as the love of God for us; but as a love which is required from us and which is exacted in the very language of the law.<a name=198:14></a> This is the leading idea.<a name=198:15></a> Christian perfection is represented as consisting in the accomplishment, on our part, of the highest requirement of the law; and it is added as a second principle, that God commands it and declares it indispensable.<a name=198:16></a> I fully admit that the knowledge of the perfect love of God (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:10">1 John  4:10</a>) necessarily produces in us a reciprocity of love.<a name=198:17></a> It is feeble, doubtless, but it is real, and it is pure; for we know the love of God, by being made "partakers of the divine nature," and by this love being shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost given to us.<a name=198:18></a> Then God dwelleth in us and we in Him.<a name=198:19></a> The love with which He loves us is, therefore, shed abroad in our hearts; and the consciousness which we have of this shews itself in our love for Him.<a name=198:20></a> The brightness of His countenance shines on ours, and ours reflects its mild and powerful rays.<a name=198:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=199>[Page 199]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This reflected shining is well pleasing to Him, because He knows the source whence it proceeds.<a name=199:1></a> And as it is by the gift of the Holy Ghost that we have known the love of God, it is by that same Spirit that the love of our hearts returns, without effort, towards the love which we have known in Him.<a name=199:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But when you tell me that God commands this love, and requires it as indispensable, you place me under law, and do away with the very principle of justification by confounding it with sanctification; you put aside grace, the grand principle of the gospel, God <i>justifying the ungodly</i>.<a name=199:3></a> By thus confounding this love where it exists, with perfect holiness and with the absence of sin, you assuredly give proof of a deep ignorance of your own heart -- an ignorance which must go on increasing, and which is found in all whom I have met with entertaining this thought.<a name=199:4></a> It is possible that some who are sincerely seeking communion with God may escape this delusion, by those happy inconsequences which result from the working of the Holy Spirit within us; but these errors and this darkness are the natural consequences of the principle itself, and are seen in the great majority of those who have embraced this doctrine.<a name=199:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us never confound a conduct void of offence with absence of all sin (that is, with the extirpation of the germ of sin from our nature).<a name=199:6></a> The Christian ought, certainly, to maintain a conduct void of offence; he ought ever to walk in the Spirit; he can never justify himself for having walked one moment in the flesh; all his faculties should be used, not by the flesh, but by the new man, that he may never stumble.<a name=199:7></a> He can never excuse himself by saying, "Alas!<a name=199:8></a> it is the <i>flesh</i> which is still in me, which occasioned my fall"; for that flesh ought to have been mortified, while the Spirit ought to regulate all our thoughts.<a name=199:9></a> He ought to have exclaimed, "Alas!<a name=199:10></a> I have failed in watchfulness, in prayer, in the use of the means of grace.<a name=199:11></a>" Perhaps he has not sufficiently examined the state of his own heart; and his distress, as in the case of Job, has been permitted for his instruction.<a name=199:12></a> Still he is without excuse.<a name=199:13></a> The blood of Jesus Christ, doubtless, expiates the sin; but as for himself, he has failed; for God is faithful, who would not have suffered him to be tempted above what he was able to bear.<a name=199:14></a> And if he should go on to plead, "I am but a child; I am still so weak in faith"; I reply, It makes no difference; for if the fear and distrust of self, which properly befit weakness, had been found in his heart, he would never have failed in this

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Allow me to direct your attention to another defect in the reasoning of those who propound this doctrine.<a name=200:2></a> You bring forward the cases of several believers of the Old Testament, who were called perfect.<a name=200:3></a> I prove to you that they have sinned: on this you reply, "That proves nothing against those who are under the more excellent grace of the new dispensation.<a name=200:4></a>" But why, if so, did you cite them?<a name=200:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is remarkable, that after the day of Pentecost, not even a single instance can be mentioned of a man's being called perfect.<a name=200:6></a> There is an important reason for this.<a name=200:7></a> The gift of the Holy Spirit has made us capable of detecting and judging the "old man," of condemning sin in the flesh, and judging nature; because we have the full knowledge of the relationship between our new man and Jesus Christ.<a name=200:8></a> Under the former dispensation, a man, who kept the commandments and ordinances of the law blamelessly, might be called "perfect," because it had not taught them to discern between the old and the new man, as we can do in the full light which the new dispensation has brought us.<a name=200:9></a> A man who walked well was <i>perfect</i>.<a name=200:10></a> But the manifestation of the new man, Christ risen, has caused us to know and discern, as a perfectly distinct thing, the old man Adam and his condemnation.<a name=200:11></a> With Paul we now can say by the Spirit, "I live; yet not I, but <i>Christ</i> liveth in me" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:20">Galatians  2:20</a>); and in another place, "It is no more I that do it, but <i>sin</i> that dwelleth in me," <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7:20">Romans  7:20</a>.<a name=200:12></a> The being "made free," spoken of in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>, has rendered us capable of judging the old man, as a nature condemned by God, because we assuredly know that we have another nature, in which we live, and by which we can thus judge it.<a name=200:13></a> Your doctrine of perfection, on the contrary, carries us back to the law, and takes away the full light of Christ, in order to make us satisfied with ourselves.<a name=200:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, observe, the principle which I have advanced supposes that we walk "in the Spirit" by a much higher rule, which admits of no pattern of conduct save the life of Christ on earth; and no standard of perfection but the glory of Christ above in heaven.<a name=200:15></a> What <i>we do</i> is not what <i>we are</i>.<a name=200:16></a> Since the fall, and since our regeneration, these two things must be distinguished.<a name=200:17></a> Jesus Christ is the example of what we <i>ought to do</i>, but He cannot

		Raise, as high as you will, the standard of holiness which we can attain on this earth, I hope to agree with you.<a name=201:5></a> But, as I have already told you, your standard is too low for me; for, according to you, a man does not commit sin although he does things which expose him to eternal damnation.<a name=201:6></a> And again, you say, the very highest point we are to aspire to is to be made like the first Adam, not like the last Adam.<a name=201:7></a> But at least do not refuse me, as the chief end of the work of Christ, the presence, glory, and heavenly rest of God.<a name=201:8></a> Say not, as you do say, that that which I can realize on earth is "the rest which remaineth for the people of God.<a name=201:9></a>" Alas!<a name=201:10></a> if it is thus with you, your religion, my dear friend, is of an earthly character.<a name=201:11></a> Instead of opening heaven before us, instead of encouraging us by such a motive to advance indefinitely in the career of holiness and piety, instead of making us feel, by that which imparts to us this new strength, that we are still far from the end to which, through grace, we shall surely attain, all your efforts are directed to the making the whole revelation of the grace of Christ serve to set up again a sort of Judaism.<a name=201:12></a> Paul, who perhaps attained the highest rank among the soldiers of the faith, has said, "If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable," <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:19">1 Corinthians  15:19</a>.<a name=201:13></a> It was because he had received the first-fruits of the Spirit that he groaned within himself (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:23">Romans  8:23</a>), that he fought, not as one that beats the air, but kept under his body and brought it

		I have but one more remark to make on the manner of quoting scripture that occurs in the pamphlet of which you spoke.<a name=202:9></a> I desire to call your attention to the criminal practice of joining the middle of one passage to a part of another, just as if the Holy Spirit employed the latter on the same occasion as the former, when it is not so.<a name=202:10></a> Take the following instances.<a name=202:11></a> I am struck by this even in its title-page.<a name=202:12></a> I read there, "Be ye perfect," which is part of a sentence taken from <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#5:48">Matthew  5:48</a>.<a name=202:13></a> "Every one that is perfect shall be as his master," another portion from <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#6:40">Luke  6:40</a>: and to these is joined, in a manner still more surprising, this fragment from Paul, "Let us, therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded" (<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3:15">Philippians  3:15</a>), the whole concluding with the verses, "If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness, he is proud, knowing nothing," etc.<a name=202:14></a> (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#6:3">1 Timothy  6:3</a>, 4).<a name=202:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A simple mind would naturally conclude that "teaching otherwise" was a reference to the thought continued in the preceding verse.<a name=202:16></a> But no; the beginning of the third quotation is in <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3:15">Philippians  3:15</a>; and the last passage, "If any man teach otherwise," etc.<a name=202:17></a>, is taken from <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#6:3">1 Timothy  6:3</a>, 4, in which the Holy Spirit applies the words to the duty of servants to their masters, and the honour which servants owe to the latter, if they are children of God.<a name=202:18></a> What can be said of such quotations?<a name=202:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Sometimes two passages are mingled in one quotation, and the reader is left to unravel its parts.<a name=202:20></a> It is said, for example, "He that shall endure unto the end, in the faith which worketh by love, that man shall be saved.<a name=202:21></a>" There is no such passage in God's word.<a name=202:22></a> The author has inserted a portion of <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#5:6">Galatians  5:6</a>, into the middle of a passage taken from <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#24:13">Matthew  24:13</a>, and has connected it by the words <i>in the</i> and <i>that man</i>, which

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have now two general observations to make on the two principal parts of this pamphlet.<a name=203:10></a> To prove the point that the state of soul depicted in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>is no other than that of an unregenerate man, the writer proceeds to bring forward, on behalf of every regenerate man, all the texts which had been brought forward as characterizing the state of a perfect man, in contradistinction with a Christian who still knows internal conflicts.<a name=203:11></a> Then, when the writer is trying to prove that such or such a passage does not apply to a regenerate man, in order to bring out the contrast, he quotes the very same passages (chapter 8), as if they were only to be understood of the regenerate generally.<a name=203:12></a> One example will explain what I mean: (page 101) -- <i>the regenerate man</i>: "I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me," etc.<a name=203:13></a> Now we have before seen, that this text has been already quoted to shew that the state of a perfect man is altogether distinct from that of a regenerate man.<a name=203:14></a> It is now applied to the latter, in order to make it appear that <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>does not at all describe the state of regeneration.<a name=203:15></a> Such inconsistency cannot be of the teaching of the Holy Spirit.<a name=203:16></a> What purpose can it serve to plunge us into principles which contradict each other?<a name=203:17></a> Such confusion ever marks false doctrine.<a name=203:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The assertions which we find at the beginning of the article, entitled "Evidences of the New Birth," etc.<a name=203:19></a>, page 170, appear to me entirely at variance with that instantaneous change, greater than justification itself, of which Mr.<a name=203:20></a> Wesley speaks.<a name=203:21></a> Here it is a question of degree, "in some degree," as it is said, in the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=204>[Page 204]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		condition of all.<a name=204:1></a> But, tell me, what mean the words, "at the commencement of our justification?<a name=204:2></a>" Is justification a work which is effected in us progressively?<a name=204:3></a> Here, again, all the characteristics of perfection are given as evidences of the new birth.<a name=204:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I now come to my second remark.<a name=204:5></a> In the whole of Mr.<a name=204:6></a> Wesley's work on Christian Perfection, the love of God towards us is never once mentioned, either as the subject of our gratitude, or as a motive to obedience.<a name=204:7></a> We are not told that the thought of this love holds any place in the heart of the perfect man.<a name=204:8></a> This is an extraordinary fact.<a name=204:9></a> I read in <a href="../bible/1John.htm#4">1 John  4</a>, "Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us" -- a doctrine very remarkable in this epistle, which treats of that "perfect love which casteth out fear.<a name=204:10></a>" It finds place there, precisely that we might be kept from the error into which Mr.<a name=204:11></a> Wesley -- too confident in himself -- has fallen, in company with all mystics: an error natural to the heart of man, who, when through grace, he loves God, turns back upon himself, reflecting upon what he is towards God, and forgetting what God is towards him.<a name=204:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Two great truths are constantly to be kept in view.<a name=204:13></a> First, To love God, because He ought to be loved, and so to reflect His image in purity.<a name=204:14></a> This is what the law requires, but man has failed in this.<a name=204:15></a> Secondly, Grace presents to us the love of God towards us, when we were unworthy of it.<a name=204:16></a> It places us in Christ, on a new and immutable foundation of eternal joy; it presents to us God Himself under an aspect unknown to Adam, and which was impossible under the law (for the law necessarily requires perfect love in us; it cannot, it ought not to spare any sinner).<a name=204:17></a> But, by the regenerating power of the life of Christ, we are renewed in the image of God; but we are renewed entirely on the principle of an eternal gratitude, which alone puts God in His right place with regard to the creature; and which puts the creature, dead and made alive again, in its place in relation to God.<a name=204:18></a> The Wesleyan system deliberately replaces the creature under the requirement of the law, and thus overturns the entire gospel.<a name=204:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		N. But there can be no doubt that Mr.<a name=204:20></a> Wesley preached the love of God to sinners.<a name=204:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A. I do not deny it, though it was in a vague manner.<a name=204:22></a> He preached it even more than some others who proclaimed the necessity of regeneration rather than made proclamation

	<div class="paragraph">
		of the love of God.<a name=205:1></a> Nevertheless, he replaces the regenerate man under law.<a name=205:2></a> In other respects there is a great deal of confusion in his doctrine; for in the midst of the highest requirement of law, he allows of things which require the expiation of the blood of Christ.<a name=205:3></a> However, he clearly proves what I say, by the very fact that, in the character of a perfect Christian, he makes no mention of the love of God towards us.<a name=205:4></a> "Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.<a name=205:5></a>" The same remark may be made on the note, entitled "Evidences of the New Birth," in which, as in his exposition of <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>, the author again completely confounds the regenerate with the perfect man.<a name=205:6></a> Confusion and error always go hand in hand.<a name=205:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Allow me, on this subject, to quote a text which has struck me forcibly.<a name=205:8></a> Ignorance and error are spoken of among you as distinct from sin.<a name=205:9></a> But I read in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#6:23">Matthew  6:23</a>, "If thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.<a name=205:10></a>" If, therefore, I am in error, in darkness as to certain things, my eye also has been in some degree not single.<a name=205:11></a> Nothing remains then but the alternative -- thine eye is evil.<a name=205:12></a> Darkness has ensued.<a name=205:13></a> A false judgment ever proceeds from wandering affections.<a name=205:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To conclude, I think that Satan has been jealous of the work of the Holy Spirit, which was awakening a desire of some better way.<a name=205:15></a> To destroy the effect of this desire, in whole or in part, he has mixed up his work with those right desires which were stirred in the hearts of many Christians.<a name=205:16></a> Alas!<a name=205:17></a> that is what he often does.<a name=205:18></a> Let us ask of God to guide us into all truth, and, in His mercy and the multitude of His loving-kindness, to bring good out of evil itself.<a name=205:19></a> May He give us to try all things by the light of His word, and with the power of His Holy Spirit.<a name=205:20></a> Amen<a href="#205:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>.<a name=205:21></a>

		PREFACE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This answer to Mr.<a name=206:3></a> Wolff's pamphlet upon Ministry was written immediately after the publication of that work.<a name=206:4></a> The author of the answer having been absent from the country for eleven months, the manuscript remained in the hands of a friend until his return.<a name=206:5></a> Since then, evangelistic labours and other occupations, still more important than controversy, have retarded the preparation of the manuscript for the press, to which it is at last given up.<a name=206:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this interval the Evangelical Society of Geneva, and the Lay Society of the Canton de Vaud, have recommended Mr.<a name=206:7></a> Wolff's pamphlet in their reports; so that the approbation which is given to this pamphlet, pretty plainly marked by facts, is now avowed.<a name=206:8></a> This renders my task more painful, but less difficult; for I can treat the writing which I am answering, not as that of a young student who is making, so to speak, his first campaign, and whom one would desire to spare, but as a work sanctioned by grave men who must have weighed things, who must have felt their own responsibility towards the Church of God, when they publicly recommended a treatise upon a subject so serious as that of ministry.<a name=206:9></a> It is to be supposed that they have examined the reasonings and the proofs advanced as having been taken from the word of God; and, by recommending this work to the whole Church, they have made themselves responsible for its contents.<a name=206:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lay Society, it is true, is careful not to take the responsibility of all the contents of the work; but, desiring the refutation of the system which it calls "Plymouthism," it points to Mr.<a name=206:11></a> Wolff's pamphlet as answering this end.<a name=206:12></a> (Sitting of the Committee of June 9th, 1843: Bulletin, No.<a name=206:13></a> 5, pages 155, 156.<a name=206:14></a>)

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Report of the Evangelical Society of Geneva makes no such reserve.<a name=207:1></a> These are the words (page 35): "Others have combated this [Plymouthism] with advantage; more particularly a student of our school of theology, in a work whose scriptural arguments cannot be shaken.<a name=207:2></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There will be found, in the body of this answer, inconsistencies in the feelings which I have expressed with regard to that work.<a name=207:3></a> Sometimes my heart has spoken in favour of the writer; sometimes I have not been altogether able to contain the indignation which I felt in seeing the way in which the word of our God has there been treated.<a name=207:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have left these inconsistencies such as they are, because it was the true expression of what I felt.<a name=207:5></a> But now that this work must be regarded as the statement of the feelings of the Evangelical Society of Geneva, or at least of its leaders, and that they have put their approbation upon these arguments by calling them <i>scriptural</i>, the reserve which the circumstances of a young man called for no longer exists.<a name=207:6></a> Looked at as coming from the hands of learned, grave, and pious men -- men in a responsible position -- men who, in other respects, I esteem and love -- this work coming, I say, from their hands, requires to be put in its true light.<a name=207:7></a> I have not in my life (and I have been in painful controversies) seen such a pamphlet.<a name=207:8></a> Of what are these gentlemen approving?<a name=207:9></a> It is a temerity which erases with a dash of the pen all that has been written on ministry from the time of Chrysostom until our own; there are self-contradictions of the grossest kind, provided that in both cases these opposed sentiments serve to establish at all costs a system that one loves; it is profound unbelief as to the presence and operations of the Holy Ghost; it is a contempt for the word, such as I have never seen the like of in any controversy; it is assertions boldly made as to the contents of the word and the use of words to give the advantage to the views of the author, which, when one examines the passages in which the word is found, are not supported by a single example, and which must have weight with those who do not know Greek, and who would not suppose -- God be thanked for it -- that things are affirmed in spite of all truth and of all honesty.<a name=207:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the pamphlet which is before us (every one will judge of it when he has read the following pages), I can only see in it the public statement of the infidelity of the professing church of these last days -- a contempt for the word of God, which deserves to be branded in a much more powerful way than I could do it -- assertions the most false, which it is impossible to attribute to the ignorance of those who recommend this work; and which proves a use of the word which (if one must attribute such a use of it to the force of party spirit) marks, in a terrible manner, what the estimation is in which the word is held, when it is a question of the interests of a party.<a name=208:4></a> These are strong expressions.<a name=208:5></a> I should not have used them, if it were only a question of an opinion on ministry, or if they were not Christians who had made themselves responsible for them: but it is a question of the whole basis of the hopes and of the activities of the Church of God, and of the authority of His word, which are sacrificed without hesitation to the interests and to the pride of an irritated party.<a name=208:6></a> Weariness of controversy almost stopped my pen.<a name=208:7></a> I thought that tears would be more suitable than an answer.<a name=208:8></a> But there are souls who have a right to the explanations that are necessary for exposing what the bold assertions are worth which characterize the pamphlet patronized by the Committee of the Evangelical Society of Geneva, and of what weight is the authority of those who can patronize it: and I have deeply felt that he who uses the word in such a way, by concealing himself under Greek, does not deserve to be spared, when presented to us by men quite capable of appreciating the use and the consequences of it.<a name=208:9></a> The more they are esteemed (and in many respects they deserve to be so), the more necessary it is to expose the roots of bitterness which they wish to sanction.<a name=208:10></a> If it were a Peter who had become guilty of that which draws others away into a path of dissimulation, it would be so much the more necessary to resist him to his face.<a name=208:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not expect to see principles which are of faith adopted by those who have not faith to follow them.<a name=209:1></a> Neither do I think that, at this moment, it is controversy that leads souls to enter the path of faith.<a name=209:2></a> It is the time for walking in it by the grace of God, and not for talking about it.<a name=209:3></a> The circumstances which surround us, and the progress of evil, call for that which God alone can give, a firm and active walk in the path in which faith alone will find means to exist; for events press upon us every day more and more.<a name=209:4></a>

		If I answer Mr.<a name=209:5></a> Wolff's thesis upon ministry, it is because it is a subject of the greatest importance, and because it will furnish the opportunity for developing the truths which are now most precious to the Church.<a name=209:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If Mr.<a name=209:7></a> Wolff's pamphlet were only the production of the student whose name is attached to it, I should probably have said nothing about it.<a name=209:8></a> Let us do justice to the writer.<a name=209:9></a> It is a work which displays a tolerable amount of diligence, and shows an application the fruits of which at such an age do honour, according to men, to the writer, and are worthy of a more advanced period of life.<a name=209:10></a> If anything here or there betrays youth, that will not be a subject of reproach with me.<a name=209:11></a> That the activity of a youthful mind should have produced, as he says, a new system, does not surprise me.<a name=209:12></a> That, in the eyes of its author, it should be a system before which all that has been said upon ministry in all ages of the Church, passes away like a shadow -- that the author should manifest a certain self-confidence, this may be natural to the ardour of youth.<a name=209:13></a> I shall not stop at it.<a name=209:14></a> He may dispose in twelve lines of all that has been written on ministry from Chrysostom to Mr.<a name=209:15></a> Rochat, confessing that he lacked the means of enlightening himself, not having been able to found anything upon the works of his predecessors; and he may deal thus in order to introduce a system of which "the systematic whole is entirely his own": I have no feeling against him on that account.<a name=209:16></a> I only recall it because of the importance which this fact acquires, when one reflects that such a judgment is approved by the party to whose jurisdiction the writer, so to speak, belongs.<a name=209:17></a> It is at least clear, according to this, that every system of ministry hitherto acknowledged, all the principles upon which ministry has been based, have been obliged to fall before the light which has entered by

		means of the discussion which has taken place on this subject.<a name=210:1></a> In order to combat what is advanced, it was necessary to set aside all that had been said on ministry by all theologians, both by those of primitive times, and by those of the Reformation and modern times.<a name=210:2></a> I acknowledge, however, that Mr.<a name=210:3></a> Wolff's treatise is the cleverest and the gravest that has appeared in the controversy begun upon this subject.<a name=210:4></a>

		This pamphlet, appearing at the moment of such a controversy, is evidently more than a student's thesis; while it is one fruit of his labour, it is the expression of far more than that.<a name=210:5></a> Puffed in the journals of his party, printed with encouragement and the concurrence of persons of that party who seek to profit by its publication, and spread it abroad by their friends and their agents, this opuscule must be considered in the main, as the expression of those who propagate it; for one must not attribute to them the dishonest tactics of a corrupted Christianity, which would like to profit as much as possible by a work, with liberty to disown it afterward, if one saw itself in danger of being compromised by its means.<a name=210:6></a>

		Meanwhile a class of persons has formed itself (the party with which Mr.<a name=211:11></a> Wolff is connected), a party which wishes to attach itself to Calvin's ecclesiastical system and to profit by it as much as possible, because this does not require faith (for a Socinian does it as well as themselves), and at the same time to introduce a spiritual activity subordinate to that system.<a name=211:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Calvin divides the gifts into ordinary and extraordinary, as the basis of the difference between the present and the apostolic condition of ministry.<a name=212:3></a> Mr.<a name=212:4></a> Wolff affirms that all the gifts were extraordinary, and that Calvin's whole system is false with regard to this, and that ministry has undergone no modification.<a name=212:5></a> Calvin's system is founded upon the difference between charges and gifts; consequently, he distinguishes between a bishop and a pastor.<a name=212:6></a> Mr.<a name=212:7></a> Wolff's whole system is based upon the identity of the bishop and the pastor.<a name=212:8></a> If bishop and pastor are not the same thing, all his system falls at once to the ground, because in that case the pastor is a gift given by God, and he has need neither of the imposition of hands, nor of being established by man.<a name=212:9></a> If the author can, on the contrary, identify them, he will in this case apply all that is said of the bishop in the epistle to Timothy to the pastor as well as to the bishop.<a name=212:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not enter into the detail of differences, for Mr.<a name=212:11></a> Wolff's system changes all the Calvin system.<a name=212:12></a> I only call attention to the great principles, or rather principle, by which they diverge.<a name=212:13></a> Calvin admits that gifts are needed for ministry; Mr.<a name=212:14></a> Wolff absolutely denies all relation between these two things.<a name=212:15></a> "Ministry," he says, "is exercised without gift.<a name=212:16></a>" He is consistent: he felt that it is impossible to reconcile the existence of gifts with the system of his party and with Calvin's ecclesiastical system.<a name=212:17></a> Calvin admitted the things that he found in the word, then added traditions and customs.<a name=212:18></a> He created a system which the light that then existed bore with.<a name=212:19></a> The party which now opposes the light is bolder; feeling that they cannot reconcile them, and determined to remain attached to existing things, they confess this unbelief on this point, and set aside at once, the gifts, the Holy Spirit, and the word which speaks of them.<a name=212:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I fully admit that he is perfectly consistent.<a name=213:5></a> At the close of the Jewish dispensation, the forms (such as priesthood, etc.<a name=213:6></a>), and the power (Christ, who was without forms) are found in opposition.<a name=213:7></a> The same thing is true now: faith chooses power and eternal things; unbelief always attaches itself to forms.<a name=213:8></a> The Reformation, so precious in many respects, mingled together some things which were of God and others which were of man; the manifestation of the energy of the Holy Spirit disentangles them.<a name=213:9></a> Those who have not faith to lean upon God alone now throw themselves boldly on forms and applaud the avowal which flows from youthful candour, or from a certain self-complacency.<a name=213:10></a> This avowal is, that power does not enter into their plan.<a name=213:11></a> They are ministers, or rather their ministers are ambassadors of Christ, because their ministry is not a gift of the Holy Ghost!<a name=213:12></a>

		MR. WOLFF'S JUDGMENT OF THE ROCHAT SYSTEM
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have said that the object of Mr.<a name=214:3></a> Wolff's pamphlet is to maintain existing things, and to oppose our brethren.<a name=214:4></a> He says of Mr.<a name=214:5></a> Rochat: "a scriptural system.<a name=214:6></a>" This is good, because Mr.<a name=214:7></a> Rochat opposes the brethren, and maintains more or less a clergy appointed by men.<a name=214:8></a> It matters little who appoints them, as Mr.<a name=214:9></a> Wolff says elsewhere, provided that it be men, and that there be no gift.<a name=214:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, at the same time, although it may be convenient to establish a unity of opposition to our brethren, in order to maintain a clergy appointed by men, in some way or another he must, in another part of the pamphlet, destroy all this in order to maintain with exactness the system of the party.<a name=214:11></a> The following are the terms in which, after having called Mr.<a name=214:12></a> Rochat's system a scriptural one (page 9), Mr.<a name=214:13></a> Wolff expresses himself with regard to the very same system in page 37 of his work, "I must add here that an election by a church, in Mr.<a name=214:14></a> Rochat's sense, cannot agree with a divine vocation of the bishop"; and lower down, "If a church, when it needs a pastor, sets about voting, by means of which the member who receives most suffrages is constituted a bishop, that bishop has received no vocation from God; he is established in the name of man, and by man only.<a name=214:15></a> This result is inevitable.<a name=214:16></a>"I am therefore obliged, according to Mr.<a name=214:17></a> Wolff, to suppose it a very scriptural thing, that the one who is bishop over the flock of God should be established <i>without any vocation from God</i>.<a name=214:18></a> It matters little.<a name=214:19></a> There are thirty-seven pages between these two sentences, and in each place these contradictory statements are made in order to sustain what is existing in his party.<a name=214:20></a>

		"they are employed at the present time.<a name=215:1></a>" They ought not to be called evangelists; because "we must carefully distinguish between what is a ministerial charge, and that which is only a testimony rendered to the gospel, voluntarily preached by a zealous and able Christian" (page 43).<a name=215:2></a> But alas!<a name=215:3></a> they are so called.<a name=215:4></a> This title, therefore, may still be preserved, provided that it is explained, and that one avoids a confusion which would be dangerous for the Church, between those who do the work, and those who are charged by men to do it.<a name=215:5></a> I say, those who do the work; for we must suppose that these men who evangelize thus approved, are sent of God.<a name=215:6></a> Hence, in our days we see many of these who are sent by men, but "they have not received the imposition of hands.<a name=215:7></a>" The whole thing, then, is to distinguish the clergy.<a name=215:8></a>

		ANOTHER EXAMPLE WITH REGARD TO TEACHERS

	<div class="paragraph">
		From page 45 to page 48, Mr.<a name=215:9></a> Wolff absolutely denies the charge of teacher in the Church.<a name=215:10></a> But he fortunately corrects himself (page 49) by adding these words, "That which has just been said with regard to teachers must be considered as in no wise affecting the degree of <i>doctor of theology</i> that the universities confer.<a name=215:11></a>" It would be difficult to understand how it did not affect it.<a name=215:12></a> If I have rightly understood, this doctor is a kind of pastor, who, by means of the students, extends his functions to a larger portion of Christ's flock.<a name=215:13></a> But we have had enough of this adulation of everything which supports the interest of a class and of a party, at the expense of faith, of the action of the Spirit, of the word, and of the truth.<a name=215:14></a>

	<div class="heading">
		ON THE PRETENDED CONNECTION OF POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS IDEAS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The thought of the influence of political over religious ideas is a vulgar one, though well calculated to exercise an influence over those who are, after all, governed by political motives of a special kind; but it will have no hold upon those who are guided by the Holy Spirit and who seek His teaching in the word.<a name=215:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		For the rest, it is a very superficial idea.<a name=215:16></a> I notice it, because the true Christian is so characterized by a spirit of submission and of obedience, that sincere souls might be troubled by it;
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=216>[Page 216]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and this is how Satan seeks to take advantage of the spirit of obedience, in order to lead the Christian to obey man.<a name=216:1></a> No one who has read history a little but is aware that there is not a single accusation brought against the religious movement of our days, that was not brought against the Reformation, and that every movement of the Spirit of God, acting, as it does, upon the inert mass which renders it necessary, is treated by those who love to sleep, or at least to remain on their bed, as a spirit of innovation and of radicalism.<a name=216:2></a> Everyone who asserts the rights of God in presence of those who are in possession of an authority which despises those rights, will be necessarily a despot and a radical in their eyes.<a name=216:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is an old accusation, and one which always comes from the wrong side.<a name=216:4></a> When Pontius Pilate could find no fault in Jesus, the priests and the rulers insisted the more, saying, "He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place," <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#23:5">Luke  23:5</a>.<a name=216:5></a> What do they say against Paul and Silas at Philippi?<a name=216:6></a> "These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city," <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#16:20">Acts  16:20</a>.<a name=216:7></a> And at Thessalonica?<a name=216:8></a> "These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also," <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#17:6">Acts  17:6</a>.<a name=216:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I exhort those who are simple, not to make themselves uneasy about a political principle or any other, but peacefully and firmly to follow the path in which the Holy Ghost leads them, walking by faith, and remembering that these accusations (for in how precious a way the word provides for every need of God's children!<a name=216:10></a>) -- that these accusations, I repeat -- are always found in the Bible to proceed from the enemies of the truth.<a name=216:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Moreover, this appearance of discernment and of philosophical depth is nothing but the superficial spirit of unbelief.<a name=216:12></a> God has at all times so prepared the suitable circumstances, for the impulse His Spirit should give.<a name=216:13></a> The circumstances for the Reformation were all prepared beforehand.<a name=216:14></a> They were equally all prepared for Christianity.<a name=216:15></a> The blindness of philosophy sees only these circumstances, and does not discern the power of God which is acting in them.<a name=216:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Unbelief is always the same; but those who act by faith know very well that they are led by something very different from circumstances; and often, in their simplicity, they do not know that circumstances favour them, save by the promise that all things shall "work together for good to them that love

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		For the rest, the application of the pretty common and true principle, that Christians in general alas!<a name=217:4></a> yield more or less to the influence of that which surrounds them, is somewhat badly made.<a name=217:5></a> As to the brethren whom the author attacks, he is singularly mistaken; for in England, on the contrary, they are accused of being all aristocrats, and the system is accused of being made for aristocrats who are discontented with nationalism.<a name=217:6></a> Philosophers look upon them as a reaction from the extreme democracy of the English dissenters<a href="#217:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>.<a name=217:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		If the Spirit does but act, it matters little: God produces effects of His grace, and the world judges them, passes on, and perishes in its wisdom.<a name=217:8></a> Some Christians perhaps yield also to the philosophical and systematizing influence of the age.<a name=217:9></a> I hope our brethren will avoid this, as much as they avoid politics.<a name=217:10></a> Scientific reasonings upon what is passing do not save souls, neither do they lift up Christians who have fallen.<a name=217:11></a> We are the servants of God: God will prepare, and God will direct, all the circumstances; we need not even occupy our minds with them, save in order to admire in it the good hand of our God.<a name=217:12></a> Our part is to follow the impulse of the Holy Ghost, and to be guided by the word.<a name=217:13></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#223:f1"><sup>+</sup></a> I say in a general sense, because the only application in this sense refers to the Jews; and it is quite false to say that vocation (*klesis*) signifies the effective calling. This word signifies, as in French, a calling, vocation. Undoubtedly, God calls the elect (@Romans 8); but so little is it true that this word signifies the effective calling which God addresses to all His elect, that it is only once found used in this sense, and nine times in a more general sense. As in French, the ordinary sense of this word in Greek expresses the character or condition which one is called to maintain or embrace (that is, the vocation). The elect have a heavenly vocation; Christians ought to abide in the vocation wherein they were called. And to shew with what levity the word is used here, the only time when the word is used in the sense of calling according to the immutable purposes of God, it applies to the Jewish nation; namely, in the passage, "The gifts and calling of God are without repentance." It is a general principle as to the calling of God; but, in Scripture, this word is never applied to an inward and effectual call in the heart. In general, as regards Christianity, this expression is, as a verb, contrasted with election. Thus in the passage, "Many are *called*, but few are *chosen*," the *chosen* or *elect* are called. Moreover, here are the passages in which this word is found: @Romans 11: 29; @1 Corinthians 7: 20; @Ephesians 1: 18, @Ephesians 4: 1: 4; @Philippians 3: 14; @Hebrews 3: 1; @2 Timothy 1: 9; @1 Corinthians 1: 26; @2 Thessalonians 1: 2; @2 Peter 1: 10.

Thus, according to Mr. Wolff's system, the list which God gave us in @Ephesians 4 is altogether erroneous; *bishop* takes the place of *pastor*, this latter word, according to Mr. Wolff, page 15, being merely the ideal expression of what a good bishop should be, and the word *teacher* embracing the two, both evangelist and bishop, page 47, No. 6.

	<div class="paragraph">
		The grand argument by which Mr.<a name=229:6></a> Wolff seeks to assimilate and confound the pastor given from on high (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:11">Ephesians  4:11</a>), with the charge of bishop, a charge unto which the apostle or his delegate can appoint, is, that it is said to the bishops of Ephesus, "Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the Church of God," <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20:28">Acts  20:28</a>.<a name=229:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		That the bishop is exhorted to feed, that I do not deny; but if such a gift be useful in the charge of a bishop, it does not follow that all those who possessed it were in that charge, and still less than that charge was the same thing as the gift.<a name=229:8></a> I can exhort my clerk to write well and to count aright, and he must know how to do these things in order to be a clerk; but it does not follow that every writer and book-keeper is a clerk.<a name=229:9></a> That charge supposes confidence, which extends to many other things: the handling of money and goods, intercourse with buyers, etc.<a name=229:10></a> Thus a man may be a pastor and be lacking as to many things requisite in a bishop, and may never have been invested with this charge.<a name=229:11></a> A man may be lacking as regards authority for governing, in discernment, oversight, the gravity necessary to act upon thoughtless minds in the details of life; or a personal knowledge of souls; and at the same time he may be capable of feeding souls with very great success, without being invested with the charge of bishop.<a name=229:12></a> That gift, that of feeding, may, together with other qualities, fit him for the charge of bishop; but <i>a charge with which one is invested</i> is not <i>a gift given by Christ ascended on high</i>.<a name=229:13></a>

		Moreover, Mr.<a name=230:7></a> Wolff is, in this respect, in contradiction with himself.<a name=230:8></a> He says (page 14), that "the names of bishop, elder, and pastor, refer to one and the same charge"; and, on the contrary, he says (page 15, 40), that "the function of pastor is connected <i>principally</i> with the episcopate"; and he gives as a proof of this that an apostle who was not a bishop calls himself a co-elder.<a name=230:9></a> This is very slight ground for denying that a thing called "gift" by the Holy Ghost is a different thing from a charge, of which the passage makes no mention.<a name=230:10></a> The last proof the writer gives, to establish the identity of pastor and bishop, consists in the <i>denial</i> that there is a particular ministry of pastor" (page 16), and saying that it is only the ministry of one who was, at the same time, pastor and teacher; and then he concludes that "the name of pastor is in this passage nothing but one among many functions, attributed to one and the same ministry.<a name=230:11></a>"

		The fact is, that Mr.<a name=231:13></a> Wolff's system cannot hold good in the face of <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4">Ephesians  4</a>.<a name=231:14></a> This chapter, for his system, is a classification of ministries; but to come to that one must introduce the bishop.<a name=231:15></a> On the other hand, to say nothing of apostles, prophets who are mentioned there are for him a gift, and an extraordinary gift too.<a name=231:16></a> So that he must lop off prophets, and then expunge pastors from this classification of ministries, and bring in bishops in their stead.<a name=231:17></a> When once this is done, teachers still remain, but they are not a ministry; so that this title too must be eliminated and looked upon as a qualification of pastors and evangelists.<a name=231:18></a> Here is the process.<a name=231:19></a> He easily disposes of apostles and prophets -- they are ministries established by God alone.<a name=231:20></a> That is soon said.<a name=231:21></a> But as to gifts, this they cannot be -- they are ministries.<a name=231:22></a> But, finally, he is not willing to consider them: in effect it would be rather inconvenient, since he is compelled elsewhere to make them to be gifts.<a name=231:23></a> As to pastors, it is an easy matter.<a name=231:24></a> Bishops are employed in feeding, therefore pastor and bishop are the same thing; we will put in bishop instead of pastor, and we have now two parts of the system of our day -- evangelists, and bishops or pastors.<a name=231:25></a> But there still remain teachers in the list, and this is

		Thirdly, those whom the writer calls Plymouth Brethren (as far as I can dare to speak for them) believe that, as the bishop was established by the apostles, he cannot be established in our day with the same formal authority.<a name=235:13></a> They leave the pastor where God placed him, that is, as a gift given by Christ when He ascended up on high and received gifts for men.<a name=235:14></a>

		In the second system, says Mr.<a name=235:15></a> Wolff, the bishop holds his ministry from men alone, and he attributes this system to Limborch and Neander.<a name=235:16></a> As to Limborch I know nothing of him.<a name=235:17></a> As to Neander, except the direct appointment by men, he is just what people call a Plymouthian, and therefore Mr.<a name=235:18></a> Wolff says of him (page 9): "a new theory, original, wholly destitute of proof.<a name=235:19></a>" In the third system, which Mr.<a name=235:20></a> Wolff calls mixed, "the bishop receives his charge by a twofold vocation from God and men.<a name=235:21></a>"

		I have been present at the imposition of hands done with simplicity, when it went not beyond the light I had; I was present and felt much joy.<a name=245:3></a> But I think that ministry can be exercised without it, without any human vocation being necessary; and I found this on <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#8:4">Acts  8:4</a>; <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#11:21">Acts  11:21</a>; <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#1:15">Philippians  1:15</a>, etc.<a name=245:4></a>; because I see from those passages, that they preached, that they evangelized, that they announced the word (I will not even mention here either the prophets or Paul), all the words which can express in the highest way the act of announcing the word being used, without the idea of ordination; and it is said that "the hand of the Lord was with them"; and because I see and believe what Mr.<a name=245:5></a> Wolff carefully avoids seeing, and what he wants to fashion according to his own mind, namely, that the ministries which concern the edification of the Church are gifts; and if they are not called <i>charismata</i> they are none the less gifts which Christ gave.<a name=245:6></a> And I bless God for it; because His work is not hindered, nor clothed with superstitious ideas, although man has marred the outward order established by the apostles.<a name=245:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us always remember that the ordination of young students, who have just left an academy, is as far as can be from the establishment of elders in the Church; that there is no similarity whatever between the two things; and that what "is practised now" has introduced into the ministry founded on that system, a mass of Socinians, Rationalists, and Arians, and conferred upon them all the rights of ministry.<a name=245:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This is indeed very convenient, in order that pastors may make pastors of certain young students who are candidates; but Barnabas, Simeon, etc.<a name=253:6></a> (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13:1">Acts  13:1</a>), were prophets who had received a vocation from God alone, and not a charge; and Paul and Barnabas depart as evangelists.<a name=253:7></a> So that, according to Mr.<a name=253:8></a> Wolff, the prophets had invested the candidates with a charge which they had not received themselves.<a name=253:9></a>

		OF THE ORDINATION OF THE BISHOP
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have only one point more to treat, as regards the imposition of hands.<a name=253:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have seen what is alleged for the ordination of evangelists.<a name=253:15></a> We have seen the preaching of the word without ordination presented under every form (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#8:4">Acts  8:4</a>): they spoke, they evangelized or announced the word (<i>lalountes</i>), <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#11:19">Acts  11:19</a>; both words are used in verse 20.<a name=253:16></a> In <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#1:15">Philippians  1:15</a> they preach, they are heralds (<i>kerussousin</i>) -- a word habitually used by Paul for his own ministry and by which he indicates his own function.<a name=253:17></a> The only case alleged of the ordination of an evangelist being the mission of the two apostles at their departure from Antioch, there only remains to be examined the ordination of the bishop.<a name=253:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was necessary for Mr.<a name=253:19></a> Wolff to point out the two ordinations, of the bishop and of the evangelist, because this answers to the evangelists and to the pastors of the present day.<a name=253:20></a> Having seen what is said about one, let us see what there is about the other.<a name=253:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

		imposition of hands by which the Holy Ghost was communicated, and the imposition of hands which was ordinarily practised (although, as a division, it is inexact).<a name=254:1></a> I acknowledge that when it is a question of the imposition of hands by Timothy, it is not a question of the gift of the Holy Ghost; but I stop there.<a name=254:2></a> All the remainder of Mr.<a name=254:3></a> Wolff's page 34 only contains arguments which are utterly groundless.<a name=254:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, all this reasoning is founded on the idea, that the imposition of hands was only practised for evangelists and for bishops, which is entirely false.<a name=254:5></a> For it is never said that hands were laid on evangelists, and it is quite certain that hands were laid on deacons, at least in the case of the seven in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#6">Acts  6</a>.<a name=254:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Secondly, Mr.<a name=254:7></a> Wolff (page 34), in favour of the imposition of hands on the bishop, alleges the injunction given to Timothy, to "lay hands suddenly on no man," <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#5:22">1 Timothy  5:22</a>.<a name=254:8></a> But almost the whole of the epistle comes in between the rules for choosing elders and this verse 22 of chapter 5; and all kinds of subjects are treated between the two passages.<a name=254:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thirdly, the passage, <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#5:22">1 Timothy  5:22</a>, does not immediately follow after some exhortations about the elder;<a href="#254:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> but it applies to Timothy's personal conduct.<a name=254:10></a> I think it probable that hands were laid on elders; because I see that this ancient sign of blessing and of setting apart for a charge was universally used; and that, among other things, the epistle treats of the charge of elder.<a name=254:11></a> But so little is it true that it is impossible to apply to any other than the bishop the imposition of which this passage speaks, it is very evident that it is a direction for Timothy's conduct in every case in which he might be called to lay hands on any one.<a name=254:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In favour of the imposition of hands having solely the bishop for its object, Mr.<a name=254:13></a> Wolff alleges a second passage, namely, <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#4:14">1 Timothy  4:14</a>: "Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.<a name=254:14></a>" His reasoning on this second text may lead to a conclusion more or less just, but which only serves to establish the fact that the word of God never says that hands

		CHAPTER 9 -- ON MR. WOLFF'S CHAPTER 9, ABOUT THE TWOFOLD VOCATION OF THE ELDER
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On the subject of the twofold vocation of the bishop, I find nothing whatever that is scriptural in Mr.<a name=255:7></a> Wolff's system.<a name=255:8></a> What is called inward or immediate vocation is not to be found in the Bible in the case of the bishop.<a name=255:9></a> The Bible supposes that a person may desire to be a bishop, but that is all.<a name=255:10></a> Where that desire exists, not a word is said about an inward vocation as a quality requisite for the charge.<a name=255:11></a> If a young man desired to be a minister, according to the present system (and it would be very difficult to find the least analogy between that and the choosing of bishops in the New Testament), the first thing which an evangelical friend of the young man would ask him is, "Do you feel yourself called of God to the ministry?<a name=255:12></a>" Not a trace of such an idea is in the epistle to Timothy: "If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work," and thereupon follow the requisite qualities, without a single word about inward vocation.<a name=255:13></a> It was a charge entrusted to persons who were qualified.<a name=255:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the confusion is the natural consequence of the confusion which is made between the pastor and the bishop; it results from having denied all the gifts and excluded them from ministry, and from the will to maintain, at any cost, the existing system and the flesh which rests there.<a name=255:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A second remark presents itself here.<a name=255:16></a> Mr.<a name=255:17></a> Wolff says (page 36), "that it is God who <i>gives</i>, who <i>sets</i> the bishops in the Church; it is men, the ministers, who establish them.<a name=255:18></a>" But in the word of God the expression "given" is never used in reference to the bishop; never is it said that God, that Christ,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All that Mr.<a name=256:7></a> Wolff says on this subject is therefore altogether false from one end to the other; it is a theory or arrangement for sanctioning that which exists without any scriptural foundation -- a theory, which, after all, is a thing quite different from the theory itself, which makes bishops of young students who have none of the qualities which God demands.<a name=256:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Mr.<a name=256:9></a> Wolff says that the word of God contains nothing against the Church's choosing among those who have already been called to the ministry, or among those who are ready to be received.<a name=256:10></a> There is in such expressions a boldness which really demands something more than the brief remarks I can give here; it is sought to justify oneself by adding to the word of God systems and thoughts of which not one trace is found there.<a name=256:11></a> Where is there to be found in the word of God a single trace of choosing among those who are already called to the ministry -- unless it be in the case of those who said, "I am of Paul, and another, I am of Apollos"?<a name=256:12></a>
	</div>

		<a class="footnote" name="#256:f1"><sup>+</sup></a> The expression in @1 Timothy 3: 1 is sufficient in itself alone to shew the difference that exists between the gift of pastor and the charge of bishop. If God gave a pastor, he who was such by the grace of God had not to desire that gift, that function; he had it. Neither was it a question of judging of the qualities of the individual, in order to know if it was fit for that place. Christ has already judged that he was fit for that place. Christ had already judged that, when He bestowed on him the grace to be pastor. But as to the episcopate, a person desires a charge, a certain position in a church; and the person to whom that care was entrusted was to begin by examining if the one who desired it had the requisite quantities. Could this be applied to what is said in @Ephesians 4? When Christ ascended, He gave pastors and teachers. If anyone desired a gift, he had to apply to the One who gave; and if anyoneaspired to a charge, he was to subject himself to an examination, that it might be known if he possessed certain quantities required for that charge.

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the case of the bishop, it was a question of a local charge; and Mr.<a name=257:6></a> Wolff admits that at that time there were ministries of apostles and of prophets, whose vocation was from God alone.<a name=257:7></a> Could the churches choose according to their will among the apostles and prophets?<a name=257:8></a> In all this portion of the pamphlet there feigns, in order to flatter that which exists, a contempt for the word of God, which one would do well to weigh before the Lord.<a name=257:9></a> God will judge.<a name=257:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		When the writer speaks of the candidate for ministry, what does it mean?<a name=257:11></a> Was a person candidate for the function of apostle or prophet?<a name=257:12></a> Was a person then chosen by such or such a church?<a name=257:13></a> For these were ministries.<a name=257:14></a> And when the apostle chose and established bishops in each town, even if there were men who desired that charge, were these churches (one knows not where) choosing amidst a company of young ministers the one who suited them?<a name=257:15></a> It is wrong, very wrong, thus to treat the word of God.<a name=257:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Finally, whether one takes ministry as being the exercise of a gift, as was the case with the apostles or prophets (for it is absurd after all to pretend to say that the prophet exercised a ministry without gift); or looks upon it as a charge, as was the case with the bishops established by the apostle, by Timothy, or by Titus; the idea of choosing among candidates or among those called to the ministry, is equally foreign to the word, excluded from the word.<a name=257:17></a> And the idea that a young candidate or an ordained minister should go and make himself heard, that the population of a place may choose him, is certainly not to be found in the word of God.<a name=257:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I cannot admit that a bishop is not a bishop without the imposition of hands.<a name=257:19></a> I have already said that, reasoning from analogy, it is probable that hands were laid on one who was to be bishop.<a name=257:20></a> But if the apostle had appointed certain persons bishops, and had established them by his own authority, they

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To insist on the imposition of hands as to the bishop (a thing which is not said in the word), then cleverly to add (page 38, 2°), "Thus he who will be pastor without receiving the imposition of hands, has not really received any charge; his ministry ought not to be received by any church" -- this is nothing but a conjuror's trick.<a name=258:4></a> For after all the pastor is not named anywhere except in a list of gifts.<a name=258:5></a> Such is the fact; and not a word of what is said of the bishop and of his charge is applied to him in the word.<a name=258:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As for the testimony drawn from <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13">Acts  13</a>(page 38, 3°) we have already found the reasoning of the writer to be entirely false.<a name=258:7></a> Thus all the high words he addressed to the brethren at the close of the paragraph are not worth much<a href="#258:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>.<a name=258:8></a> The man who thinks that Paul and Barnabas received the collation of the charge of simple evangelists from prophets and teachers at Antioch, and who makes this the basis of his reproof, needs in effect to cry out very loud in order to make himself heard.<a name=258:9></a>

To confer such an imposition of hands, or even to seek after it, is a monstrosity.

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		After having, in support of election by men and ordination, assimilated the pastor to the bishop, Mr.<a name=259:1></a> Wolff puts on the same line and in the same condition the pastor and the evangelist, in order that the election and the ordination which he connects with the first may be indispensable for the second.<a name=259:2></a> The charges of evangelist and of pastors," says Mr.<a name=259:3></a> Wolff, "are so much of the same nature .<a name=259:4></a>.<a name=259:5></a>.<a name=259:6></a> that they may often be blended together, and that one may pass from one to the other," etc.<a name=259:7></a> (page 44).<a name=259:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The grand principles having been discussed, I will try to be brief, on this point.<a name=259:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>First</i>, Mr.<a name=259:11></a> Wolff will have it that those whom the Spirit of God calls apostles can be nothing but bishops or evangelists.<a name=259:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		What connection is there between a bishop and an apostle or sent one?<a name=259:13></a> This it would be difficult to discover.<a name=259:14></a> Moreover it is a merely gratuitous assertion.<a name=259:15></a> I allow myself to consider as being apostles those whom the word of God calls apostles, that is, as having been especially sent by the Lord, although it may not have been, as to all of them, with the same authority.<a name=259:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>Secondly</i>, Mr.<a name=259:17></a> Wolff confounds the messengers of the churches (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#8:23">2 Corinthians  8:23</a>) with the messengers of Christ.<a name=259:18></a> As to the application of the other passages, it appears to me more than uncertain.<a name=259:19></a> When Paul says "us the apostles," it does not mean, necessarily, Silvanus and Timothy, who were with him.<a name=259:20></a> Even if it be so (and I am not anxious to dispute it), it is never said that their functions were those of an evangelist.<a name=259:21></a>

		<i>Thirdly</i>, as to <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:28">1 Corinthians  12:28</a>.<a name=259:22></a> In spite of Mr.<a name=259:23></a> Wolff's assertion, the evangelist is not named here.<a name=259:24></a>
	</div>

		In fine, having done with this confusion, I acknowledge that the evangelist was a gift of God according to <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:11">Ephesians  4:11</a>.<a name=259:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the vocation which, according to Mr.<a name=259:26></a> Wolff's assertion, the evangelist receives from men, I stop here.<a name=259:27></a> We have seen that all, according to their ability, preached; and that the mere fact that Paul wished Timothy to accompany him does not shew that he was called to a special charge as evangelist, and shews still less that all evangelists had received a vocation from men.<a name=259:28></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I admit that all those who bear testimony according to their ability, are not, properly speaking, evangelists.<a name=260:5></a> The evangelist is a gift (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:11">Ephesians  4:11</a>); but the imposition of hands on an evangelist is never mentioned, either as necessary for his work, or in any respect whatever.<a name=260:6></a> We find ever and again in the author the desire to sanction at all costs the present order of things.<a name=260:7></a> An evangelist, according to him, partakes so entirely of the same nature as the pastor, that he may settle in a place, after having formed a flock; but I shall say nothing about it, for the reason -- that there is not a syllable about all this in the word.<a name=260:8></a> If he who acts thus has both gifts, it is all well; if not, it is very wrong.<a name=260:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To understand the way in which Mr.<a name=260:10></a> Wolff draws conclusions from the word, I also beg of the reader to compare the quotations which he has made from <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#18:26">Acts  18:26</a>; <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#16:19">1 Corinthians  16:19</a>, and <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#16:3">Romans  16:3</a>, with a view to shew that Aquila was in turn pastor and evangelist, having, we must suppose, received the imposition of hands.<a name=260:11></a> Perhaps we ought to suppose he had received it twice; for nothing authorizes us to suppose that ministry was conferred by wholesale, as it is practised now.<a name=260:12></a> A special charge was conferred, those who received the collation of the charge being solemnly recognized by competent authorities, as being called to it of God.<a name=260:13></a> For otherwise, it would be a question, not of various ministries or of vocation, but of ministry in general, without a special charge.<a name=260:14></a> This is what is practised in our day.<a name=260:15></a> One man, after having been recognized as fit to be a bishop, goes on to present himself, upon his own authority, as evangelist; another, after having been ordained as evangelist, goes on to assume, upon his own authority, the charge of bishop in a locality which pleases him.<a name=260:16></a> We must remember, that, according to Mr.<a name=260:17></a> Wolff's system, it is by no means a question, in ministry, of the exercise of a gift, but of a charge which is only received by the imposition of hands.<a name=260:18></a> A man evangelizes without a gift, a man is a bishop without

		All that Mr.<a name=262:13></a> Wolff says on the subject presents such confusion, that it is impossible to get clear of it; for he makes the teacher to be a sort of quality which pervades every charge; but in the passages already quoted, the word of God presents to us the doctorship as a gift.<a name=262:14></a> It is not only a <i>doma</i>, but a <i>charisma</i>;

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a sweet and precious thought that God is sufficient for the Church, in His grace, at all times; but to say that the ministry of the apostle always subsists, is to say that the revelation of certain rules constituted the whole of that ministry, and that there was in the apostle neither personal power nor personal authority: it is to disown the importance of the presence and power of the Holy Ghost.<a name=265:3></a> Mr.<a name=265:4></a> Wolff himself says that the effect of the gift of prophecy was such that unbelievers acknowledge that God was there, but that it is no longer so now.<a name=265:5></a> How then can he pretend that the ministry of the prophet still subsists?<a name=265:6></a> Perhaps he will say that when the prophet prophesied, he was not exercising a ministry, but his gift; but he cannot expect that men of good sense will attend to such absurdities.<a name=265:7></a>

		I do not feel the need of following out the reasonings (page 55) by which they have sought to make of the Church a counterpoise to the pastor, as if it were a constitution from carnal men.<a name=266:10></a> It is just this habit, merely carnal, of the age and of the country, which has done so much harm to souls and to flocks.<a name=266:11></a> To my mind, the flock which feels that its business is to be a counterpoise to its pastor, is in a sad state.<a name=266:12></a> I am not surprised at many things that have happened, if such principles are approved of.<a name=266:13></a> For the rest, all that is merely <i>ad captandum</i>, to catch flies; but alas!<a name=266:14></a> all that is based upon the rejection of the Holy Ghost.<a name=266:15></a> At the beginning, the Holy Ghost was leading on together all believers as being of one heart; but flesh needs a counterpoise.<a name=266:16></a>

		As to the progress of the evil, of the mystery of iniquity, this is what I have to say about it.<a name=277:18></a> One may, indeed, present the difficulty, that it is Christendom, and not the Church, that is in a state of ruin.<a name=277:19></a>

		Here is my answer: The evil has begun in the Church; Christians have, in principle, fallen into Judaism.<a name=278:1></a> The door has been opened to false brethren; and this, by degrees, has formed Christendom!<a name=278:2></a> Thus the Church has lost its unity, its power, and its holiness, and has ceased to bear witness to God in the world; and what is called "the church" is now the centre and the power of evil and corruption in the world.<a name=278:3></a> After all this, there will be an open revolt, and the lawless one, the man of sin, will be manifested.<a name=278:4></a> Thus the fault has begun with the Church, with Christians.<a name=278:5></a> Moreover, although Christians may separate themselves from this evil (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#3:5">2 Timothy  3:5</a>), this does not prevent the state of things, the dispensation, from being entirely marred, nor God's putting an end to it by His judgments to make room for Christ and His glory.<a name=278:6></a> Thus, although the elect are glorified with Him, it is none the less true that all will be cut off here below.<a name=278:7></a> It was thus that God put an end to the kingdom of Saul to make room for David; and to Judaism to make room for the Church, although, at all times, He has saved the elect.<a name=278:8></a> The gates of <i>Hades</i> shall not prevail against the Church; but it is the resurrection which will be the proof of it; for the Son of the living God is mightier than he who has the power of death.<a name=278:9></a> This does not prevent God from removing His elect to heaven, in order to send His judgments on the inhabitants of the earth -- to destroy those who corrupt the earth.<a name=278:10></a>

		The repentance of a particular church is not the restoring of a fallen dispensation, as Mr.<a name=278:11></a> Wolff pretends (pages 63, 3°, 64, 4°), alleging even the example of the Jewish dispensation in its falls and restorations; for, after all, as we see, they are reduced to speak of the fall of a dispensation.<a name=278:12></a> The writer even goes so far as to say (page 64, 4°) that "every time there were men who feared God, they restored the whole dispensation, and partook of all its blessings.<a name=278:13></a>" This is inconceivably bold.<a name=278:14></a> Did the faithfulness of some men fearing God restore the unity of the kingdoms of Israel and of Judah?<a name=278:15></a> Did it throw down the golden calves?<a name=278:16></a> Did it identify the Israelites with the temple and altar of God?<a name=278:17></a> Never.<a name=278:18></a> Did the piety of Josiah turn away the wrath of God from Judah?<a name=278:19></a> No: after the account of what Josiah did, when he "turned to the Lord with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might" (<a href="../bible/2Kings.htm#23:25">2 Kings  23:25</a>), it is added (verse 26), "Notwithstanding the Lord turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath, wherewith his anger

		As for me, I see but one thing -- the faith of the godly woman who spoke of the coming of Jesus "to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem.<a name=279:20></a>" It appears that, on the one hand, these persons who looked for redemption in Israel knew one another, and that, on the other hand, they knew the ruin and judgment which had fallen upon Israel; because the Israelites also thought that they were enjoying all the blessings of the dispensation, and because they thought they were rich and had need of nothing.<a name=279:21></a> Thus it was that the light which had come in grace was found to be for judgment.<a name=279:22></a> In this sense, Christ overthrew the Jewish dispensation; but whose was the fault?<a name=279:23></a> Who was it, on the one hand, that said, "For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not

	<div class="paragraph">
		The writer does not stop there; he adds (page 64, 5°), that to speak of the ruin of the dispensation, is to be guilty of an insult against God and other things besides; but it is quite unnecessary to answer such reproach.<a name=280:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Finally, the writer goes still farther, and says (page 65, 6°), that "if the dispensation is ruined, we are without any commands or any directions from God; we have no longer any right to the use of the sacraments, or to the common worship of the faithful.<a name=281:3></a> Nothing remains to us of the dispensation but its ruins.<a name=281:4></a> There is not in Scripture one single precept, not one single commandment of the Lord, which can be applied to us, and that we are bound to obey.<a name=281:5></a> We can neither attain to the holiness to which the first Christians were exhorted, nor bear any responsibility," etc.<a name=281:6></a> It may be that the writer cannot find anything, if everything is not there.<a name=281:7></a> For my part, I believe that "the secret of the Lord is with them that fear him; and he will shew them his covenant.<a name=281:8></a>" I believe that ministry subsists, and that, although there is nobody who can order or settle everything as an apostle would do, it is none the less true that "where two or three are gathered together" in the name of Jesus, He is "in the midst of them"; and that the word of God provides for the wants of His people in their present state, as in every other state.<a name=281:9></a> When, by His judgments, God had deprived Israel of the prophets and of the Urim and the Thummim, the writer might have expressed the same complaints and reproach; but this reproach I find very ill placed in the mouth of one who declares that not a single gift remains to the Church.<a name=281:10></a> This would lead one to suppose that, in the writer's opinion, gifts were not a means of sanctification.<a name=281:11></a> But there are precepts for the "perilous times" as there were for the times of blessing, when "great grace was upon them all," when none said "that aught of the things which he possessed was his own," <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#4">Acts  4</a>.<a name=281:12></a> God never forsakes His people.<a name=281:13></a>

		I have already replied to this chapter.<a name=281:14></a> I only need to recall the passage of Peter, "As every man hath received the gift [<i>charisma</i>], even so minister the same [<i>diakoneo</i>] one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.<a name=281:15></a>"

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Further, all the passages quoted by Mr.<a name=282:4></a> Wolff, as giving us classification of ministries, are, in the word, lists of gifts (<i>domata</i>) (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4">Ephesians  4</a>); <i>charismata</i> (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>).<a name=282:5></a> The idea of a maximum of ministry, of gifts, is to me quite new.<a name=282:6></a> Indeed it was perhaps the principle of dissenters to choose the person who, in their eyes, had the most gifts.<a name=282:7></a> It may so happen that inferior gifts are not exercised, when there are superior gifts; and it may so happen for better or for worse.<a name=282:8></a> "The spirits of the prophets" were "subject to the prophets," however miraculous even the gift might be.<a name=282:9></a> To suppress an inferior gift is an evil; but if, in a given case, there be, according to the Spirit, on such or such an occasion, more edification in a superior gift, the rule of the word is "Let all things be done unto edifying.<a name=282:10></a>" The fact that Paul spoke during the whole night does in no wise shew that there were no gifts at Troas; any more than his discourse at Miletus shews that the bishops of Ephesus had none.<a name=282:11></a> In the case of the bishops it was not a question of gifts, except in a practical way that of feeding: but this does not affect all other ministry.<a name=282:12></a>

		CHAPTER 16 -- ON MR. WOLFF'S CHAPTER 16, WHERE THIS WRITER PRETENDS TO PROVE, BY TWENTY-FIVE REASONS, THAT THE GIFTS OF THE HOLY GHOST HAVE ALL CEASED
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The writer begins his demonstration by rather a remarkable avowal.<a name=283:1></a> It is, that the existence of gifts by the side of ministry is impossible -- at least by the side of such a ministry as Mr.<a name=283:2></a> Wolff will have.<a name=283:3></a> In order that his ministry may exist, it is necessary that gifts should have absolutely ceased.<a name=283:4></a> I believe it.<a name=283:5></a> It is on this point the popish system (that is, a ministry which has God's authority, having its vocation from Him, without dependence on the Holy Ghost, and without flowing from His energy, without partaking either of His gifts): and so true is this, that if there were gifts, it would no longer subsist.<a name=283:6></a> It is important well to understand this position.<a name=283:7></a> The basis of the whole pamphlet is the absolute incompatibility of ministry (according to the system of Mr.<a name=283:8></a> Wolff and his party) with the existence of the active energy and the gifts of the Holy Ghost.<a name=283:9></a> Yes, the writer says so (page 69): "To pretend to the present existence of gifts is to establish by the side of ministry a rival power which hinders it, which enervates it, and which, by placing itself above it, ends either by killing it, or by forcing it to throw itself into clerical despotism in order to maintain its rank and its dignity.<a name=283:10></a>" What a confession!<a name=283:11></a> But at least we can bless God that He has been pleased to compel our adversaries thus to avow what is true as to their system.<a name=283:12></a> The Holy Ghost must be excluded!<a name=283:13></a> This is what decided me on that point many years ago; but I did not expect to find a public avowal of it.<a name=283:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The writer seeks to avoid setting everybody against him by admitting brotherly exhortation; but even this resource the word takes from him; for exhortation is a gift (<i>charisma</i>) according to the word (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12:6">Romans  12:6</a>-8).<a name=283:15></a>

		But there is something to point out as to the use of the words.<a name=286:3></a> First, the word <i>charisma</i> is used very generally in the word for a free gift, as in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:15">Romans  5:15</a>, 16, where it is used indiscriminately with <i>dorea</i> and <i>charis</i> and <i>dorema</i>.<a name=286:4></a> The difference is this, that <i>charisma</i> and <i>dorema</i> signify rather the thing given: <i>dorea</i> and <i>charis</i>, the former the free character of the gift, as with an intention to express that it is a gift; the latter, <i>charis</i>, expresses the grace, the principle by virtue of which one gives freely.<a name=286:5></a>

		The Holy Ghost having come from God, at the same time being God, the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts.<a name=293:7></a> Being sent by the Father, He is a Spirit of adoption.<a name=293:8></a> Being the Spirit of Christ, He forms our affections and our walk according to the pattern of Christ.<a name=293:9></a> Sent, because the Son of man, rejected on earth, was received at the right hand of God, He is especially the witness of the glory of the Son of man, and of the grace that can flow out to the world as following after His glorification.<a name=293:10></a> Hence He comes on all flesh, and not only on the Jews; so that here grace and gifts are identified, for instance, in the tongues.<a name=293:11></a> The Holy Ghost overflows the narrow limits of Judaism, and, extending to the judgment of Babel, He reveals to all nations, to each in its own tongue, "the wonderful works of God.<a name=293:12></a>" It was a gift, but it was also a remarkable testimony to grace.<a name=293:13></a> Miracles bear the same testimony; they shew that God in goodness had come into the midst of the evil, and both overruled and cast out the power of the prince of this world; for such was the effect of the presence of the Holy Ghost.<a name=293:14></a> It was God who in grace had come into the midst of the world, having the Church as the vessel of His power, and thus acting in man, and acting there in testimony to the glory and victory of Christ as man.<a name=293:15></a> We see in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>and <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#4">Acts  4</a>the union of all this, and that in the normal state the presence of the Holy Ghost produced grace, unity, power, and joy.<a name=293:16></a> God was there, and the evil hid itself, as vanquished before His presence -- a presence which, identifying itself with the new man, with the Christian, occupied with the state of things in which sin had plunged the old man; and the effect of this was, as in Samaria, quite natural (although the malice of the heart opposed it): "there was great joy in that city.<a name=293:17></a>" But the object was not only to bear testimony (that the world might believe) to the

		grace of God and to the victory of the Son of man over the power of Satan -- a testimony borne in the aggregated Church by sovereign grace, to the glory of the Son Himself, who was not ashamed to call His brethren those who were sanctified.<a name=294:1></a> The Church itself was also the object.<a name=294:2></a> God had given His beloved ones to Christ.<a name=294:3></a> Christ had undertaken their salvation.<a name=294:4></a> He "loved the church and gave himself for it, that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, that he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing.<a name=294:5></a>" Thus He nourisheth and cherisheth it as His own flesh.<a name=294:6></a> It is not a question of manifesting His rights and His glory to the world, although His glory be found there, and will at a future time be found there in a far more evident way (to wit, when the whole Church will have come unto perfection); neither is it a question of the operation of God properly speaking, in testimony, in the midst of evil.<a name=294:7></a> It is a question of the affections of Christ for the Church, and the care He takes of it in His faithfulness.<a name=294:8></a> It is a question of cleansing it by the word, in order to present it to Himself in glory, and cause it to grow up into Him in all things while it is down here.<a name=294:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence (although it is painful for me to be so didactic and methodical on a subject so precious and so full of strength and joy; but it is in order to be understood by those who are occupied with it) it follows that the Holy Ghost acts in three ways.<a name=294:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>First</i>, He is God present and working in power.<a name=294:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>Secondly</i>, He manifests, by His operations, the glory of the Son of man, and thus the relation of God in grace with the world.<a name=294:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>Thirdly</i>, Christ Himself nourishes and leads by His Spirit the Church, His body, for the edifying of it in love.<a name=294:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first two of these three things are found in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>.<a name=294:14></a> God, by the Spirit, is there, in contrast with the demons who, as instruments, governed and seduced the world; but then it is a question, first of all, of acknowledging Jesus (and Jesus as man) to be the Lord, faithful to God, the conqueror of Satan.<a name=294:15></a> It is for this that God is acting in the world; as it is what makes an essential distinction between the Holy Ghost and demons.<a name=294:16></a> No one, speaking in the power of the Spirit, can say, Anathema Jesus; nor say, through a demon, Lord Jesus.<a name=294:17></a> Besides that, "there are diversities of gifts"; but not

		many spirits, as was the case with the demons, of whom there were many.<a name=295:1></a> There is one Spirit.<a name=295:2></a> There are diversities of services, but one Lord, He to whom the Holy Ghost bore witness.<a name=295:3></a> "There are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.<a name=295:4></a>" That which was an operation of God was, at the same time, a gift of the Holy Ghost, and a service done to the Lord whom that Spirit glorified and whom the God "who worketh all" had made "both Lord and Christ," and placed at His own right hand in glory; <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:30">Acts  2:30</a>-36.<a name=295:5></a> The identity of the operation of God and of the Holy Ghost is seen by comparing verses 6 and 11.<a name=295:6></a> If the Holy Ghost works and speaks in us, He works and speaks to render testimony to Christ, the Lord; and thus He causes him who speaks to act and to speak as servant or minister of Christ (not to be independent, because he has the Spirit).<a name=295:7></a> Therefore, the apostle says, Many members "are one body, so also is Christ.<a name=295:8></a>" The members are directed by the head; the head uses the members.<a name=295:9></a> Therefore is it said (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#3:8">2 Corinthians  3:8</a>) "the ministration of the Spirit.<a name=295:10></a>" The Holy Ghost gives the gift, and the individual thus made competent exercises his ministry, according to the passage of Peter, which we have already quoted, "As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same" -- or exercise ministry therein "as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.<a name=295:11></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Therefore, uniting the three things, as in the passage we are considering, the apostle says (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#3:5">2 Corinthians  3:5</a>, 6), "Our sufficiency is of God; who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament [covenant]; not of the letter, but of the Spirit," etc.<a name=295:12></a>; and (verse 3) "Ye are the epistle of Christ, ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God.<a name=295:13></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Was not the apostle acting in his own gift of apostle when he did this?<a name=295:14></a> If not, do pray tell me what he did with his gift?<a name=295:15></a> No: it is evident that the object of the Holy Ghost was to give the link of these three things: the Spirit acting in gift, the operation of God therein, and the service or ministry to the Lord.<a name=295:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Further, it is not as concerning the Persons in the Trinity that all this is presented to us, but it is the order of the acting of God, of the Lord, and of the Spirit, looked upon as acting on earth.<a name=295:17></a> If the Lord and the Spirit had been spoken of, one might have supposed something inferior to God; for the

		heathen were accustomed to spirits of Python, etc.<a name=296:1></a>, and to lords in great number.<a name=296:2></a> Therefore does the apostle insist upon there being but one Spirit who gives divers gifts, and not many spirits; one Lord who governed all that and was Head in all that -- the Lord whom the Spirit glorified; lastly, he insists on this, that it was God Himself, the one true God, who worked in all that.<a name=296:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And mark that the writer himself calls our attention to the use of the word spiritual gifts (<i>pneumatika</i>) in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:1">1 Corinthians  12:1</a>: "A name," he says (page 70), "which is assigned to them exclusively.<a name=296:4></a>" He mistakes in saying "exclusively," for the word is often used for the things of the Spirit in general.<a name=296:5></a> See <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#15:27">Romans  15:27</a>, <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#9:11">1 Corinthians  9:11</a>; chapter 2: 13, in which last passage I would translate "communicating spiritual [things] by spiritual [means]"; or "[the things] of the Spirit by [words] of the Spirit.<a name=296:6></a>" But here the things of the Spirit are gifts.<a name=296:7></a> Now, treating of these things of the Spirit, he speaks of the ministries of the one Lord.<a name=296:8></a> How then can one say that these ministries were not among those things of the Spirit?<a name=296:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And here I recall what I have already pointed out in part, namely, that in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:4">1 Corinthians  12:4</a>, 9 it is a question, according to Mr.<a name=296:10></a> Wolff, of gifts properly so called (page 70); the repetition of the same subject in verse 28 is a classification of ministry (page 50); and (page 71) <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:28">1 Corinthians  12:28</a> is a catalogue of gifts, and gives us five.<a name=296:11></a> In this chapter, therefore, as on the other hand it is God who works, all the beauty and ornament of Christ in His body on earth was connected with the presence and operation of the Holy Ghost.<a name=296:12></a> The operation of God, the lordship of Jesus, the service of the believer, and the gifts of the Holy Ghost, were identified in the unity of the body, in the service of each member, in the diversity of gifts which were the manifestation of the Holy Ghost.<a name=296:13></a> We have in all that a dissertation on the things of the Spirit, the <i>pneumatika</i>.<a name=296:14></a> But it must not be thought that the action of the Holy Ghost consisted solely in fresh revelations; the word of knowledge and the word of wisdom were gifts of the Holy Ghost as well as a prophecy properly so called.<a name=296:15></a> As Paul says also in chapter 14, "If I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?<a name=296:16></a>" It is sometimes supposed that there must be a fresh revelation if

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We saw that there is another object, to wit, the nurture and increase of the Church.<a name=297:3></a> Here then, it is no longer the beauty and ornament of the Church before the world, even by the gifts of the Holy Ghost, nor the operation of God in testimony, but the care Christ takes of His own body, of His flesh; <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4">Ephesians  4</a>.<a name=297:4></a> "He ascended up on high .<a name=297:5></a>.<a name=297:6></a>.<a name=297:7></a> and gave gifts [<i>domata</i>] unto men.<a name=297:8></a>" Here the act of giving and the gifts are specially connected with Christ, who, as Head, nourishes the body.<a name=297:9></a> It is not a question of adorning the aggregate, or of acting in virtue of the rights of Christ, but of the relationship between the body and the Head.<a name=297:10></a> It is gathering and nourishing the Church, and not acting by the members of the Church, by particular acts of power.<a name=297:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The epistle of the Ephesians presents two great subjects as to the Church: First, the coming glory of the Church, a thing which is secured; it will enjoy the glory in the heavenly places with its Head.<a name=297:12></a> In spirit, it is seated there in Him.<a name=297:13></a> Secondly, Besides that, it is the "habitation of God through the Spirit" here below.<a name=297:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Two things flow from that: unity in humility and the Spirit of peace; grace given to every one according to the measure of the gift of Christ.<a name=297:15></a> But the gifts here given, the apostle, the prophet, the evangelist, the pastor, and teacher, have all for object the formation, establishment, and edification of the body.<a name=297:16></a> And we must here observe that it is functions or permanent gifts that are given; it is a pastor, it is an evangelist.<a name=297:17></a> It is not a gift of such a character given to an individual thus gifted by Christ ascended on high.<a name=297:18></a> The pastor himself, the apostle himself, is the gift.<a name=297:19></a> Christ received the gift having ascended up on high, and He manifests it in the function of the individual; and the gift is here connected with continual service, and is not merely a manifestation of power.<a name=297:20></a> In <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>it is rather power given for service, power which might be used through vanity, as it really happened.<a name=297:21></a> Here the member serves by the gift, which only acts in the blessing of the body.<a name=297:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It would be a singular commentary on this passage, to say, This means that, if any one speak by the Spirit, then he must speak by the Spirit: otherwise he may speak as much as he likes, without troubling himself about it; inasmuch as a man is a minister, he may speak without thus ascribing all to God.<a name=298:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>we have therefore the presence of the Holy Ghost as one in the Church, then the operation of God, then the gifts as manifestation of the Spirit.<a name=298:13></a> In <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4">Ephesians  4</a>we have the gifts which Christ received, which are being exercised in the edification of the body.<a name=298:14></a> In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12">Romans  12</a>we have all that is done for good in Christians service treated as gift.<a name=298:15></a> Lastly, <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#4">1 Peter  4</a>we have the obligation of thus ascribing all to God.<a name=298:16></a>

		As to the quotation given by Mr.<a name=307:5></a> Wolff of <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#6:1">Acts  6:1</a>-4, it is so much outside the subject that I need not dwell upon it.<a name=307:6></a> The man who can mistake the daily administration of help to widows for the Lord's Supper may very well suppose all he likes; and in Mr.<a name=307:7></a> Wolff's interpretation, <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#6:1">Acts  6:1</a>-4, supposes that the apostles had abandoned the administration of the table of the Lord as being of slight importance, and that the deacons, and not the elders, are to preside there.<a name=307:8></a> What is said in paragraph 4° of page 81, is therefore unworthy of an answer.<a name=307:9></a> To say that the word of God which accompanies the outward act is more important than the Supper itself is to exalt a discourse without gifts above the remembrance of Jesus instituted by Himself.<a name=307:10></a> Moreover, where did the writer find this -- "the word of God which accompanies the sacrament"?<a name=307:11></a> Besides, it is very certain that in the primitive Church there was nobody established to speak a word; for the prophets spoke as God led them, according to the rules given in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14">1 Corinthians  14</a>.<a name=307:12></a> For an apostle to break the bread, when he was present (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20:11">Acts  20:11</a>), was a very natural thing, and appears to me very suitable; but I do not see that this proves that the ministry had the exclusive right so to do.<a name=307:13></a>

		REMARKS ON THE PRESENCE OF THE HOLY GHOST IN THE CHRISTIAN
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I desire to make a few remarks<a href="#314:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> of a practical tendency and of deep interest, on the effects of the presence of the Holy Ghost in the Christian.<a name=314:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Spirit of God, as dwelling in us, may be considered in two aspects: for He unites us to the Lord Jesus, so that His presence is intimately connected with <i>life</i>, that life which is in Jesus; <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:19">John  14:19</a>, 20; <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:20">Galatians  2:20</a>.<a name=314:2></a> "He that is joined unto the Lord is one Spirit"; and further, His presence is that of God in the soul.<a name=314:3></a> The scripture, speaking of Him in the first of these characters (which is sometimes linked to the second), says (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:2">Romans  8:2</a>, 9, 10), that the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus frees us from the law of sin; so that the Spirit is <i>life</i> because of righteousness.<a name=314:4></a> It is, however, also said (verse 9), "if so be that the <i>Spirit of God</i> dwell in you"; and then His in-dwelling and action are blended, since (inasmuch as both are manifested by the formation of the character of Christ in the soul) "the Spirit of God" becomes "the Spirit of Christ.<a name=314:5></a>" The "Christ in you" of verse 10 expresses the idea more clearly, especially as the apostle adds, "if Christ be in you, the Spirit is <i>life</i>.<a name=314:6></a>" But in verse 16 the Holy Ghost is carefully distinguished from the Christian, for "He beareth witness <i>with</i> our spirit.<a name=314:7></a>" In verses 26 and 27 the two characters of the presence of the Spirit are there remarkably shewn out in their mutual connections:<a href="#314:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a> for "the mind of the Spirit," known to God, who searches the heart, is the life of the Spirit in the saint.<a name=314:8></a> But, on the other hand, "the Spirit helpeth our infirmities," and "maketh intercession for the saints, according to the will of God.<a name=314:9></a>" The reason of all this is simple.<a name=314:10></a> On the one hand, the Spirit is there and acts with power according to the mind of Christ; on the other hand, and in consequence
	</div>
	<div class="footnote">

		of this operation, the affections, thoughts, and works, are produced, which are those of the Spirit; but yet they are also ours, because we are partakers of them with Christ, "our life" (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3:2">Colossians  3:2</a>, 3), for "God hath given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.<a name=315:1></a> He that hath the Son hath life.<a name=315:2></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the effect of the second aspect of the presence of the Holy Ghost is yet more important.<a name=315:3></a> The Spirit is the Spirit of God; He is God, and is, therefore, the revelation of the presence and power of God in the soul -- a revelation known <i>through</i> and in a new nature which is of Him.<a name=315:4></a> Consequently, that which is in the nature and character of God is developed where God dwells, i.<a name=315:5></a>e.<a name=315:6></a>, in the soul of the saint; not only is it produced in the new man, the creation of God, but it fills the soul, because God is there, and there is communion with Him.<a name=315:7></a> For instance, the new nature loves, and this love is a proof that one is "born of God," and knows God.<a name=315:8></a> But this is not all; there is, moreover, the in-dwelling of the Holy Ghost -- that is to say, the presence of the God who communicates this new nature to us.<a name=315:9></a> Therefore we read (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:5">Romans  5:5</a>) "the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which is given unto us.<a name=315:10></a>" We are loved -- we know it, and have the proof of it in the gift of the precious Saviour, and in His death for us (verse 6-8).<a name=315:11></a> But there is something more; the perfect and infinite love shed abroad in our hearts (poor vessels as they are), and the Holy Spirit, who is God, is there (and is free to be there, because we are purified by the blood of Christ) -- He is there to fill these vessels with that which is divine -- the love of God.<a name=315:12></a> It is also added (verse 11), that we joy in God.<a name=315:13></a> Therefore, looking at the presence of the Spirit as demonstration of power in the soul, the apostle John affirms that "hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us," <a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:24">1 John  3:24</a>.<a name=315:14></a> But, as this might be applied merely to the varied energy of the Spirit in the soul, it is stated, farther on, that "love is made perfect in us," namely, the love of God to us.<a name=315:15></a> Here it is no longer a question of us, of our affections, of our thoughts; but the soul is filled with the fulness of God, which leaves no room for anything else; there is no discord in the heart, to spoil the essential character of divine love.<a name=315:16></a> God, complete in Himself, excludes all that is contrary to Himself; otherwise He would be no longer Himself.<a name=315:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To avoid <i>mysticism</i> (the enemy's corruption of these truths) the Holy Ghost adds by the same pen, "herein is love, not

	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		that we loved God, but that he loved us" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:10">1 John  4:10</a>); and the proof of this is based on that which is above all human thought and knowledge, namely, on the acts of God Himself in Christ.<a name=316:1></a> On the other hand, the presence of the Spirit is not given him as the proof of God's dwelling in us, two things which are identical, but it is written, "hereby know we that <i>we</i> dwell <i>in him</i>, and he in us, because he hath given us <i>of</i> his Spirit.<a name=316:2></a>" This presence of God in love not only fills our narrow souls, but places us <i>in Him</i> who is infinite in love.<a name=316:3></a> United to Christ by the Holy Ghost, one in life with Him, and the Spirit acting in us, "we dwell in God, and God in us.<a name=316:4></a>" Therefore it is said that "God has given us of his Spirit"; that is to say, God, in virtue of His presence and of His power, makes us morally partakers of His nature and character, by the Holy Ghost in us, whilst giving us the enjoyment of communion with Himself, and at the same time introducing us into His fulness.<a name=316:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would here just point out the distinctive characters of the epistles of Paul, Peter, and John.<a name=316:6></a> Paul was raised up in an extraordinary manner for the especial purpose of communicating to the Church the order, method, and sovereignty of the divine operations; and to reveal the place which the Church holds in the midst of all this, inasmuch as she is united to Christ, and is the marvellous object of the counsels of God in grace; as the apostle says (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2:7">Ephesians  2:7</a>), "that in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace, in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus," or by His dealings with regard to the Church: the wisdom of God, the righteousness of His ways, and the counsels of His grace on this subject, are largely and (as all revelation) perfectly set forth in the writings of Paul.<a name=316:7></a> John takes up another point, that of the communication of the divine nature, what that nature is, and, consequently, what God is, whether in His living manifestations in Christ, or in the life which He communicates to others.<a name=316:8></a> Without this community of nature communion were impossible; for darkness can have no fellowship with light.<a name=316:9></a> But, as we have already seen, the apostle goes still farther: we dwell in God, and God in us, by the Holy Ghost; and thus, as far as we are capable of it, we enjoy what God is in Himself, and become the manifestation of Him (the limit to this manifestation being only in the vessel in which God has taken up His abode).<a name=316:10></a> How great are the varied riches of the goodness of God!<a name=316:11></a> This communion

		with Him, which raises us as far as possible towards the fulness of Him who reveals Himself in us, is certainly something very sweet and precious; but the tenderness of God toward us, poor pilgrims on the earth, and His faithful love, so needed in our weakness to carry us onward to the goal, are not less so.<a name=317:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The testimony of Peter, in his first epistle, treats of that which God is for the pilgrim, and of what the latter should be for God.<a name=317:2></a> The resurrection of the Messiah has set the pilgrim on his road; and thereon are presented the faithfulness of God, and the encouragement which His power gives to our hope by this resurrection of Christ the Son of the living God, though rejected of men; and lastly, the apostle speaks of the walk, the worship, and the service which flow from it.<a name=317:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		John presents to us that which is most exalted in communion, or rather in the nature of communion; consequently, he does not touch on the subject of the Church, as an object of divine counsels, but of the divine nature.<a name=317:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul treats of that which is perfect, not in respect of communion, but of counsel.<a name=317:5></a> In his writings God is glorified more especially as the object of faith, though he speaks of communion too (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:5">Romans  5:5</a>).<a name=317:6></a> Where, in the same chapter (verse 11), he speaks of God as the one in whom the Christian is to glory he places Him before and not as in us -- as the object for faith to lay hold of and not as dwelling in the heart.<a name=317:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This divine and infinite blessing -- this love perfected in us, communicated by the presence of the Holy Ghost, and realized by our dwelling in God and He in us -- has led some to think that, when this point is attained, the flesh can exist in us no longer; but this is to confound the vessel with the treasure placed in it, and of which it has the enjoyment.<a name=317:8></a> We are in the body which still awaits its redemption: only God can dwell in it, because of the sprinkling of the blood by faith.<a name=317:9></a> This sprinkling does not correct the flesh, but only renders testimony both to the perfection of the expected redemption and to the love to which we owe it.<a name=317:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When in real enjoyment of God, we may for a moment lose sight of the existence of the flesh, because then the soul (which is finite) is filled with that which is infinite.<a name=317:11></a> But even in these moments of blessedness one cannot doubt but that the flesh is an obstacle to the larger and more intelligent action of love.<a name=317:12></a> Paul, caught up into the third heaven (a privilege which the flesh would have used to puff him up with, and which made a

		thorn needful), is a proof to us that grace does not change the flesh.<a name=318:1></a> Alas!<a name=318:2></a> even the joy of which we are speaking, without watchful dependence upon Christ, gives dangerous occasions of action to the flesh, because there is so much littleness in us, that, forgetting who gives the joy, we lean on the feeling of the joy, instead of dwelling in Christ, the Fountain-head of it.<a name=318:3></a> Nevertheless, it is certain that the love of God, made perfect in us, is a reality, and the Christian is called to know God, and to enjoy Him as dwelling in Him.<a name=318:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have but one more remark to make.<a name=318:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When we are full of the love of God, we enjoy it with a power that hinders our seeing anything, especially the objects of the goodness of God, save with the eye of divine love.<a name=318:6></a> But where there is a real knowledge of the existence and nature of this love of God, the walk will also be characterized by faith in that love, even though the heart may not realize the whole power of it; and, thus, we shall dwell in God and He in us.<a name=318:7></a> But since this fulness of joy can only be realized by the action of the Spirit, it is easy to understand that, if grieved, He will become a Spirit of reproof, judging the ingratitude with which such love, as the love of God is requited, instead of filling the heart with that love; though it is impossible for Him to cast a doubt upon it.<a name=318:8></a> It is evident that the love made perfect in us is the work of God; and this it is which forms the joy -- the whole of the state.<a name=318:9></a> That which the Holy Ghost sheds abroad in our hearts is the love of God; and this love, powerful in our hearts, cannot but shew itself externally.<a name=318:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That which I have said does not, properly speaking, belong to the operations of the Holy Spirit, but the subject is of the greatest importance.<a name=318:11></a> And this importance, which is that of the fruits and grand results of the presence of the Holy Ghost (for by it the love of God and of Christ is glorified, as far as it is possible here below), seemed to render a few remarks upon this subject desirable.<a name=318:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		May God bless them to the reader!<a name=318:13></a> May it please Him to realize in us the things of which I speak on the subject of revelation, and may He so bless as that the truth may have its full weight on the soul; so that we may know, with all the beloved Church of Christ, what it is to have the Holy Ghost dwelling in us according to the power of the love of God!<a name=318:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		First, let us remember this, that the presence of gift did not in the smallest degree hinder the working of the flesh in speaking: it was at full work, to the marring of edification, and that in the grossest shape (for men were speaking what nobody understood at all), when the gifts were undeniable.<a name=322:4></a> It is not the presence of real gifts that is any check to this fleshly confusion.<a name=322:5></a> It was the most undeniable utterance-gifts, tongues for example, when there could be no mistake as to the Spirit's power, which were the <i>occasion</i> of carnal confusion.<a name=322:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is of the last importance, because the assertion is, that persons speaking without gift, on the assumption that they have it, produce confusion, and the remedy is that they should recognize that there is no gift now; and thus the ministry be left to persons, gracious persons no doubt, who, by their human attainments, are capable of satisfying in general the demands of the flock for instruction.<a name=322:7></a> Now the answer at once is that all this is without foundation.<a name=322:8></a> The edification of the flock had to be watched over against the licence of the flesh where there were gifts, as much as on the assumption that there are none.<a name=322:9></a> The question does not lie there at all.<a name=322:10></a> The ground of the argument is all a mistake.<a name=322:11></a> It lies much more in the spiritual grace which can maintain the edification of the body.<a name=322:12></a>

		This is the writer's statement of what gift is: "Charisma, or gift, I look upon as quite distinct from everything of man's doing -- distinct from the natural ability or talent he may possess of God, distinct from the improvement and sanctification of that talent, and alike distinct from any attainment he might make by the diligent use of means.<a name=324:11></a> It is the Holy Spirit giving, in distinctness to anything we see in man.<a name=324:12></a> It is that giving when the power of the Spirit is manifestly seen using the creature indeed, and yet clearly to be distinguished from the creature; as, for instance, we see in the gift of tongues, etc .<a name=324:13></a>.<a name=324:14></a>.<a name=324:15></a> .<a name=324:16></a> So I believe it was of all gifts of the Spirit, etc .<a name=324:17></a>.<a name=324:18></a>.<a name=324:19></a> .<a name=324:20></a> Such I believe to be of (?<a name=324:21></a>) the true nature and meaning of gift; and I am not aware that there is any passage in the New Testament in which <i>charisma</i>, or gift, can be shewn to be something different from this.<a name=324:22></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This statement is constantly referred to and in substance repeated.<a name=324:23></a> We shall find that the writer's statement involves the whole question of the presence of the Holy Ghost in the body, the Church; because He must act in some way if He be there to act in the body.<a name=324:24></a> I say the presence of the Holy Ghost in the body, not His merely acting in grace in individual minds.<a name=324:25></a> This question is entirely overlooked in the writer's statements.<a name=324:26></a>

		difficulty as to the expression "gifts of the Spirit," as a general human expression, sufficiently exact to convey historically what was meant; but when this is insisted on <i>as</i> a definition, it is important to notice that there is no such term in Scripture; and the Holy Ghost is never spoken of as giving.<a name=325:1></a> Nor do I apprehend that this distinction is without intention on the part of the divine Spirit.<a name=325:2></a> At any rate, on a very important and delicate subject it is well, when we are defining, not to speak otherwise than the word speaks.<a name=325:3></a>

		Next, that <i>charisma</i> is a free gift, or a something freely given, and not attained by man's labour, is evident.<a name=325:4></a> The word means it.<a name=325:5></a> But then it is quite beside the mark to speak of the word meaning "the Spirit's giving.<a name=325:6></a>" First, it is used independently of all question of the Spirit's giving in several passages.<a name=325:7></a> In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:15">Romans  5:15</a>, 16; chapter 6: 23, it is the free gift of God unto justification and eternal life; in chapter 11: 29, it is used in the most general way possible, and applied to God's purpose as to the Jews.<a name=325:8></a> This the writer recognizes in the latter passage.<a name=325:9></a> It is very doubtful whether the statement made there as to <i>charismata Theou</i> could be applied to what are called spiritual gifts.<a name=325:10></a> At any rate, the word by these passages is proved not to have any particular application to the Spirit's giving in its meaning.<a name=325:11></a> It means free gift; and whatever is free gift may be called <i>charisma</i>.<a name=325:12></a> Now here there was nothing of the Spirit being seen, manifestly seen, using the creature, and yet clearly to be distinguished from the creature.<a name=325:13></a> This life was "I live, and yet not I, but Christ liveth in me; and the life which I <i>live</i> in the flesh, I <i>live</i> by the faith of the Son of God.<a name=325:14></a>" So that free gift was not necessarily (in the case to which the writer compares it and which is called effectively <i>charisma</i>) what he affirms in the same place it must be, as the only true meaning of the word; so much the contrary, that in the case alluded to a man could say, "I, yet not I, and the life which I live.<a name=325:15></a>" That is, precisely the contrary was the case to that asserted by the writer.<a name=325:16></a> <i>Charisma</i>, or gift, is not what the writer asserts.<a name=325:17></a>

		Nor can I see that the fact that certain gifts were evidently supernatural, as miracles and signs (which are by the apostle declared to be inferior to others, and as tongues said to be signs to unbelievers, as indeed miracles were also to confirm the word), should exalt such form of gift above that which edified the Church, or converted souls, but which had not necessarily any such form, and whose power was seen only in the conviction of a sinner's conscience, or the edifying of a believer's soul.<a name=328:1></a>

		Further, I proceed to shew that as regards the distinction of gift from diligence in the use of means, though the gift be not thus acquired, the writer is wrong: and further, that while gift is really gift, inasmuch as God give it, yet that God prepares the vessel, so that suitability is God's way of acting in this.<a name=329:1></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		First, as to diligence in the use of means; the statements of Scripture shew the writer's notion of using the creature independently of such diligence to be entirely false.<a name=329:2></a> In <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#4">1 Timothy  4</a>the apostle thus addresses his beloved son in the faith: "Till I come give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.<a name=329:3></a> Neglect not the gift that is in thee which was given thee by prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.<a name=329:4></a> Meditate upon (or occupy thyself with) these things, give thyself wholly to them, that thy profiting may appear unto all men; take heed to thyself and unto the doctrine; continue in them, for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee.<a name=329:5></a>" Is the possession of gift so contrasted here with the use of means, so that profiting should appear?<a name=329:6></a> Again, "Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God which is in thee, by the putting on of my hands.<a name=329:7></a> For God hath not given us the spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.<a name=329:8></a> That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us.<a name=329:9></a> The whole of these directions prove that the possession of <i>charisma</i> was to be accompanied by the use, the diligent use of means, so that profiting should appear; and that the writer's confined use of it is entirely a false one.<a name=329:10></a>

		Further, as to being distinct from natural endowment.<a name=329:11></a> The writer instances tongues.<a name=329:12></a> I really cannot say as to this, it may have been so; but the general rule in gifts for edification is otherwise.<a name=329:13></a> The principle of scripture, of the Lord, is natural endowment, gift, and diligence through confidence in His love.<a name=329:14></a> The last two we have seen in Timothy, while in Peter we have been guarded from the abuse of it, into which the writer has fallen.<a name=329:15></a> In <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#25">Matthew  25</a>we have the express statement of the Lord, that when He went away, He called His servants, and gave to each of them according to his several ability; and they then traded with the talents as His given money.<a name=329:16></a> So Paul was a chosen vessel, as well as the receiver of a gift; and I think no one can doubt the remarkable qualities which preceded his call.<a name=329:17></a> Nor in reading the history of Peter and James and John, "who seemed to be pillars," can any one

		Let us turn to <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12">Romans  12</a>.<a name=330:8></a> The apostle, after exhorting every man to think soberly of himself, according as God had dealt to every man the measure of faith, for that we are all members of the same body (a point we will, D.<a name=330:9></a>V.<a name=330:10></a>, touch on presently) adds, "having then gifts differing according to the grace given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith, or ministry on ministering, or he that teacheth on teaching, or he that exhorteth on exhortation; he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.<a name=330:11></a>" Now I ask, is it possible (if the apostle had the idea of gift which the writer has) that such a passage would have been found?<a name=330:12></a> Could he have spoken of ministry -- not of the word properly, but of any service to the saints -- teaching, exhortation, giving, and ruling, and then pass on to what are fruits and the walk of grace, heading all with the word 'gift' (<i>charisma</i>),

		It is quite evident that, while some gifts bore externally the stamp of supernatural power, or, if believed, having the character of new revelation, were necessarily assumed to be such, the piety (and I apprehend the enlightened and scriptural piety of the saints, whose record is in the word) recognized everything as a gift (<i>charisma</i>); and, as the Holy Ghost and He only did everything in the Church that was good, it was attributed to Him; not as His gift, but as His working.<a name=331:2></a> To say otherwise would be to confine His working to signs or revelations, which is clearly false.<a name=331:3></a> And hence the lists of gifts are altogether diverse, according to the subject of the writer, and none of them complete as if it were a regular enunciation of certain known things, because all that was done for God, God was the doer of it; and that doing was gift to the Church in him in whom it was accomplished, and Peter forbids its being done in any other way.<a name=331:4></a> The service or ministry which we have (I have no doubt in Peter, but certainly in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12">Romans  12</a>) as gift, being by Peter contrasted with speaking, and indeed in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12">Romans  12</a>too.<a name=331:5></a> It is clear that exhortation and evangelizing were neither signs nor fresh revelations, yet they were gifts.<a name=331:6></a> Indeed, receiving the word (not on the ground of signs, but) by faith in the conscience, is the only true receiving of it; and the fact of signs accompanying it is just the proof that it was not a sign itself.<a name=331:7></a> And now see what we have lost as coming from God -- we may have it, it seems, as man's sanctified qualities and attainments, but not as a gift from God<a href="#331:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>.<a name=331:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Further, either there were in the primitive Church two sorts of ministry, one which came as a gift from God, and one which did not (which I leave anybody to believe that will, and which I have no doubt Peter forbids expressly), or else the ministry which is now sought to be set up is altogether different, and is not recognized in Scripture at all; and this is a very serious point, the proper operation of the Spirit being hereby absolutely excluded, His will in sovereignty in distributing, but above all, His operation.<a name=331:9></a> The individual, it seems, may be sanctified in

	<div class="paragraph">
		And the apostle is so far from presenting that which is adorned with the outward ostensible sign, as being the most valuable and important gifts, that he states exactly the contrary, distinguishing the two kinds.<a name=332:11></a> Comeliness, says he, is put upon what is less comely; for our comely parts have no need: but God has thus tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked.<a name=332:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The principle stated is that there is a unity of the body in one Spirit; but that to every one of us grace (<i>charis</i>) is giver according to the measure of the gift of Christ.<a name=333:7></a> The <i>charismata</i> in Peter are said to be received according to the manifold <i>charis</i>; that it is Christ who fills all things, who being ascended up, and so Head of the Church (and this is the doctrine of the whole epistle), has given in particular these gifts.<a name=333:8></a> Every one has received as a member of the body; but these notable gifts are particularly marked out, which especially minister of the fulness of Christ for the gathering or nourishment of the body, that we might grow up to Him in all things, who is the Head.<a name=333:9></a> They come from the Head (to the Church over all things), that we may grow up to the Head; of whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every one part maketh increase of the body to the edifying of itself in love.<a name=333:10></a>

		And here a word on what is called impulse in passing.<a name=334:5></a> I have no love for the word, but rather the contrary; but I am not frightened by a word either.<a name=334:6></a> If by impulse be meant the real present acting of the Holy Ghost leading saints to speak and guiding them in speaking, it is surely the only thing of any value or power.<a name=334:7></a> If they are not so led by the Holy Ghost, they must be led by something else, which will not be, to say the least, the present acting of the Holy Ghost: and therefore if even very good things may be said, it will not be power; for in every sense power belongs unto God.<a name=334:8></a> We have already seen that organic utterance (if there be any gift, which is simply such, i.<a name=334:9></a>e.<a name=334:10></a>, the use of the creature without his mind) is the lowest kind, and the Corinthians are treated as children in understanding for thinking much of it.<a name=334:11></a> We have seen real, proper gift, or <i>charisma</i>, identified in the case of Timothy with the diligent use of means; and I add here that the mind using truth, and the Holy Ghost using the mind, are two very different things, for God is in one of them; but the Holy Ghost's using the mind is gift, properly and truly gift, and stated by the apostle to be the superior kind of gift.<a name=334:12></a> Having already spoken of this, I cannot be charged with any wild idea of impulse; but I do say that the acting of the Holy Ghost in and by man, in a member of the body (which is what the apostle calls gift), is what we are to look for by faith, and is the only thing of any real value or power.<a name=334:13></a> I admit that the Holy Ghost can, in another's mind, use what is not such.<a name=334:14></a> The testimony of Christ printed on a playbill for an oratorio may be used by the Holy Ghost in the reader's mind for conversion; and the mind's statement of truth may be used in another soul by the

		Take another point, "Be not drunk with wine, but be filled with the Spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs.<a name=335:2></a>" I suppose, when filled with the Spirit, the Holy Ghost was acting, and acting immediately, I may say sensibly.<a name=335:3></a> Is all this to be laid aside too?<a name=335:4></a> Is it wrong to be filled with the Holy Ghost, or wrong to hope that there may be more of it?<a name=335:5></a> And this "be not drunk with wine" is wonderfully like "these men are not drunken as ye suppose," when tongues were spoken.<a name=335:6></a> I am not adducing this to shew that we are not to look for tongues, but that the notion of denying gift goes much farther than is supposed -- that it goes to denying the present acting of the Spirit of God, the being filled with the Spirit, as well as the unity of the membership of the Church of God, which are either dead, or active by virtue of the Spirit in what is called in Scripture gifts, and that <i>eni ekusto</i>, to each one, and called <i>charisma</i> too.<a name=335:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		For let us turn to Corinthians: we have the same principles as in Ephesians.<a name=335:8></a> Only (the subject not being the exaltation of Christ over all things, as the one head of the body), the subject is approached from a different side to suit the <i>pneumatiko</i>, and the contrast of the one Holy Ghost with the many demons.<a name=335:9></a> But while thus taking it up on a different ground, it comes to the same statements: the same doctrine is found in it.<a name=335:10></a> First that which distinguishes the Holy Ghost is that He says, in the saint, "Lord Jesus": a demon would not, But this shews that it acted in the mind, person, and faith of the individual; as indeed the demons often did, when really such, as in an oracle.<a name=335:11></a> See the case of Legion: "what have I to do with thee?<a name=335:12></a> I pray thee torment me not"; only it was by blinding the mind, and not by light.<a name=335:13></a> Nor do I doubt that this often happens now.<a name=335:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit Here I would remark by the way, that this is not calling them gifts of, or given by, the Spirit, but merely that it was not as with demons, many, each acting by himself; but that though the gifts were many the Spirit was one.<a name=335:15></a> It was clearly the operation of the Spirit in these gifts; but He is never said to be the Giver of most of them, I doubt not of all: Christ is said to be the Giver, as in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4">Ephesians  4</a>, and so in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>, "being by the right hand of God exalted, he hath shed forth this which

	<div class="paragraph">
		But to pursue -- one more point.<a name=336:5></a> Whatever were the manifestations of the Spirit, it was for profit, not for display; but, whatever they were, the point insisted on is, it was "<i>one and the same Spirit</i>.<a name=336:6></a>" "For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of that one body being many are one body; so also is Christ.<a name=336:7></a>" And here I would ask, Is Christ so now?<a name=336:8></a> That man has marred and maimed this body, as regards its condition on earth, is admitted -- yea, earnestly urged; but in the principle of its existence, can it be said now, "so also is Christ"?<a name=336:9></a> This evidently is a most serious question.<a name=336:10></a>

		Haggai could say to Israel, on whom Lo-ammi was already written, "As in the days when ye came up out of Egypt, so my Spirit remaineth among you, fear ye not.<a name=336:11></a>" What a blessed and important consolation this!<a name=336:12></a> and ground on which faith could rest in its hopes, its confidence, or its labour.<a name=336:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now what I would remark here is, the way in which the gifts (<i>charismata</i>) are indissolubly knit up with the unity and membership of the body.<a name=336:22></a> And this is no casual idea: we have found the same connected with the headship of Christ as <i>domata</i> in the Ephesians.<a name=336:23></a> Here we see the basis is stated, "by one Spirit we have been baptized into one body," and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And, further, this universality of action is assumed as a possibility in the whole body, in respect of the most public and evident gifts.<a name=337:4></a> "When ye are gathered together in one place, if all speak with tongues, will they not say, you are mad?<a name=337:5></a> but if all prophesy, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all, and the secrets of his heart being revealed, he falls down and confesses that God is in you of a truth" (i.<a name=337:6></a>e.<a name=337:7></a>, that God is in the assembly, in the saints).<a name=337:8></a> Is all this gone too?<a name=337:9></a> He does not fall down and confess that God is in such or such a gifted person; much less does he admire or look up to the spiritual attainments of an individual: he confesses that God is in the assembly, among the Christians.<a name=337:10></a> And is this to be lost, and not even sought, and individual attainment substituted for the presence of God in the assembly?<a name=337:11></a> For this is the real question: not merely whether such individual acts on such or such a principle, but whether I am to look to God or to man -- to God's presence in the assembly, or to man's competency by acquired attainments.<a name=337:12></a> Can I be satisfied with the latter without some very clear proof that the former is not to be sought-that God has abandoned the assembly of His saints?<a name=337:13></a> For if there, is He not to make His presence known?<a name=337:14></a> If He do, it is a manifestation of the Spirit in the individual who acts; it is a gift, and, if you please, an impulse.<a name=337:15></a> It is God acting: that is the great point.<a name=337:16></a>

		And here I remark that the application of "the rest" ("let the rest judge") to a certain number of recognized teachers, is entirely against the sense and spirit of the passage.<a name=337:17></a> That an unspiritual man, in whom the Holy Ghost's power is not, is incapable of so judging is quite true, though "the spiritual man judgeth all things.<a name=337:18></a>" But what the apostle is considering is the power of the Spirit of God in the gathered assembly;

		Let us turn to Romans.<a name=338:2></a> Here again the same principle meets us.<a name=338:3></a> "For I say," says the apostle, "through the grace given unto me, to every one among you, not to think highly of himself, above what he ought to think; but to think soberly according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.<a name=338:4></a>" Here again we have a very important principle: no false pretension, sober thoughts of self and gift.<a name=338:5></a> <i>Charisma</i> (as we may see in what the apostle goes on to say) is spoken of as God's dealing to every man the measure of faith -- this is to be the ground for every man to act upon; if he goes beyond it much or little, he is in the flesh and in folly, let his attainments or acceptance be what they may.<a name=338:6></a> We want God in order to be profited, and that is according to the measure of faith, and that in every man.<a name=338:7></a> For as in one body we have many members, but all the members have not the same function, so we, being many, are one body in Christ, but each members one of another, but having different gifts (<i>charismata</i>), according to the grace given to us, whether prophecy [let us prophesy] according to the proportion of faith.<a name=338:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is, then, in the unity of the body, according as God has dealt to every man the measure of faith.<a name=338:9></a> This is the principle of gifts (<i>charismata</i>); happy are we that it is so simple.<a name=338:10></a> That there were gifts which had a sensibly miraculous character I do not deny, and such as we have lost; but I deny that this was the necessary character or real meaning of <i>charisma</i> (but the effect or produce of <i>charis</i>, grace, here applied to the action of a member of the body in service.<a name=338:11></a>) These gifts, however, were by no means the most important ones, and their absence does not touch the truth of the presence of the Holy Ghost in the body, acting (as He is still sovereign in doing) in the unity of the body in its several members, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.<a name=338:12></a> I add here, I have no doubt that the object of the apostle in this passage is to confine each to this measure of faith, to think soberly of himself, and to confine himself to what God has dealt to him; first, as to the nature, and secondly as to the measure, of the gift;

		PREFACE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In correcting this tract for a third edition, I have not entered on the distinction to be made between the body of Christ and the habitation of the Spirit -- in that one is composed of members livingly united to the Head, the other built (see <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#3">1 Corinthians  3</a>) by the instrumentality of responsible men on earth: I have treated it elsewhere.<a name=341:1></a> It is an important practical point in connection with the present <i>state</i> of the Church of God, but does not affect the great fundamental principles which govern the whole enquiry, as here pursued.<a name=341:2></a> I have corrected the passages in which there may have been so far confusion between the two as to lead to any practical obscurity of the mind on the subject.<a name=341:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The importance of the question of the Holy Ghost's presence in the Church on earth, will render some inquiry into it profitable to us.<a name=341:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a great question of principle regarding the position and walk of the saints which has arisen wherever that testimony of God specially committed, as I believe, to those commonly called the brethren, has existed.<a name=341:5></a> It is a question of vast importance -- a principle resisted abroad as well as in England; and the resistance to which is always connected with the establishment, in one shape or other, of a clergy under the title of ministry.<a name=341:6></a> All I shall attempt here is to set the principle clear.<a name=341:7></a> There is, I fully believe, as real a question of God's truth as in Luther's days: I do not say as important a one; because in Luther's time the question was one of the ground of individual salvation -- of the basis of our standing with God.<a name=341:8></a> Whereas the question now at issue is the position and standing of the Church, of the saints gathered when they are saved.<a name=341:9></a> But no one will think this a trifling question.<a name=341:10></a> It is closely connected with Christ's glory and the doctrine of the Holy Ghost.<a name=341:11></a> The question in Luther's time was the value and efficacy of Christ's work; or, in other words, justification by faith.<a name=341:12></a> What existed he assumed to be the Church.<a name=341:13></a> The

	<div class="paragraph">
		question now is the presence and power of the Holy Ghost as forming and embodying the Church in unity.<a name=342:1></a> This evidently is important.<a name=342:2></a> It has been accompanied among the brethren with the revival, as I judge, of the clear doctrine of justification by faith, which was much buried under collateral doctrines, as regeneration and its proofs, which had really taken the place of justification by faith; so that, in general, assurance of salvation was rare, and considered to be a matter of spiritual attainment.<a name=342:3></a> Besides, there are truths to which God recalls the saints as being important at such or such a time, as leading to peculiar and needed blessings, or as bearing on peculiar evils or dangers, and against which therefore the malice of the enemy will be particularly directed, to oppose or undermine them.<a name=342:4></a> Such I believe the doctrine of the Holy Ghost's presence in the Church to be at this time.<a name=342:5></a> The unity of the body as Christ's spouse, <i>separate from evil</i>, is closely connected, yea, identified with, this great doctrine, which is founded on the exaltation of Christ as Son of man to the right hand of God, in testimony of the full completeness of His work, and His infinite favour with God.<a name=342:6></a> And hence its connection with the full, free assurance of salvation in the soul, and the joy of adoption by the Holy Ghost.<a name=342:7></a> No one taught of God could knowingly undervalue such a doctrine; and I do especially believe that no one specially taught of God now, "men having understanding of the times," but will on the contrary feel its peculiar vital importance, as ministered of God in the Church for saving souls, and the Church itself from the current delusions of the day.<a name=342:8></a> This is the question before us.<a name=342:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are three great points connected with the doctrine of Christ, or positions in which He may be viewed: a crucified Christ, accomplishing the work of redemption, in virtue of which, as testified of in resurrection, justification is the portion of the believer; an exalted Christ, in whose name, and by whose sending, the Holy Ghost the Comforter is come down on earth, and dwells in the Church; and Christ coming again in Person.<a name=342:10></a> Now the first of these, namely, justification by faith, was preached by Luther, and souls were delivered, and many peoples set free from the burden of popery.<a name=342:11></a> But the Holy Ghost sent down here, though taught in a measure as a truth, formed no part of that which characterized the Church; and therefore it fell under the power of the magistrate, when delivered from the Pope.<a name=342:12></a> The doctrine of the Lord's second

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That which characterized the ministry and testimony of those called the brethren, however feeble, and feeble they were, was (with the accompanying revival of assurance by faith in the simple testimony of redemption) the bringing out and walking in the faith of the two latter doctrines: namely, the Holy Ghost in the Church, and the coming again in Person of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=343:2></a> And this ministry was blessed both in gathering many into a simple position by it, and extending the happy influence of these truths among many who were not so gathered.<a name=343:3></a> With this connected itself the unity of the Church as the body of Christ by the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven, and that, separate from the world, as bride of the Lamb.<a name=343:4></a> A comparison of what the Church was at first when filled with the Spirit led them to the sense of our present ruined state, and to seek in earnest devotedness more conformity to its early path, and that nothing should be owned which was not of the Holy Ghost.<a name=343:5></a> And they waited for God's Son from heaven.<a name=343:6></a> If the presence of the Spirit gave them the consciousness of being the bride, He made them also earnestly desire the coming of the Bridegroom, and the joy of that day when Christ should come and receive them to Himself, and take the kingdom and the glory.<a name=343:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		They entered in spirit, in their little measure, into that word, "The Spirit and the bride say, Come"; and they were happy and blessed.<a name=343:8></a> And where, beloved brethren, let me ask you with the apostle, is that blessedness ye spake of?<a name=343:9></a> Did you suffer so many things in vain, or for an error, if it be yet in vain?<a name=343:10></a> Did you begin in the Spirit, or was it all a delusion of your imagination which wiser minds have discovered, and that you are glad to give decently up, and to end in the flesh?<a name=343:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the presence of the Holy Ghost in the Church was (with the waiting for Christ's coming), the grand doctrine on which the whole testimony of those so-called brethren was founded.<a name=343:12></a> And this it is which it is sought to deprive you of.<a name=343:13></a> Let us not deceive ourselves; this is what is in question.<a name=343:14></a> It will soon be seen everywhere, save as this truth itself is forgotten anywhere.<a name=343:15></a> It may be clothed in terms which may seem not to deny it, because that would alarm -- in terms suited, alas!<a name=343:16></a> to the

		I dare say it may not be admitted: but if one comes to rob me of my treasure, his not telling me he is, nor admitting he is, cannot satisfy me.<a name=344:5></a> But this, perhaps, it will be said, they do not mean to do.<a name=344:6></a> I will admit they may be ignorant of the truth itself, and therefore of the loss of it, and therefore not be aware of the mischief they are doing.<a name=344:7></a> But, if one is urging the vessel on the shoals, and he is mentally innocent, because he does not know them, that will not content me as a passenger if I know, nay, not even if I suspect them.<a name=344:8></a> But is it denied?<a name=344:9></a> Is it not admitted?<a name=344:10></a> It has been distinctly taught that the acting of the Holy Ghost in the body being in the members, the presence of the Holy Ghost practically was by the teachers.<a name=344:11></a> Now, because there is truth in this, and that the Holy Ghost does act by the teachers, the denying such a doctrine is treated as if it were denying the Holy Ghost's acting in the teacher, and, in a word, denying ministry.<a name=344:12></a> But it is no such thing.<a name=344:13></a> What is affirmed is the presence of the Holy Ghost in the Church itself on earth.<a name=344:14></a> No doubt when there, He acts, among other things, by teachers, etc.<a name=344:15></a>; but He is present in the Church.<a name=344:16></a> And anyone can see that, assuming His acting in the teachers, and denying His dwelling in the whole assembly or Church as such; or denying His acting properly in the way of gift in any, but that grace just sanctifies natural talent and education; and that there is no dwelling in the whole body, as distinct from the members (these teachers being the members who are to act), is throwing the whole matter into the hands of certain persons who have more natural talent to the exclusion of the body.<a name=344:17></a> It is the reconstituting a clergy who form the Church, and who are to judge of the qualifications of others whom they admit into their ranks: for this is demanded also.<a name=344:18></a> It is just the clergy over again.<a name=344:19></a> I recognize that God forms the vessel individually for service as well as puts a gift into it, when I look at the individual.<a name=344:20></a> I have no doubt that the blessed apostle Paul was a man of most extraordinary natural character.<a name=344:21></a> But this truth, which I find in Scripture, does not make me deny that the Holy Ghost dwells in the Church.<a name=344:22></a>

		But I will first bring out the idea before the minds of brethren, that by it they may be able, through grace, to judge of the statements by which it is pared down and destroyed, and what they are losing for their souls if these statements are listened to.<a name=345:1></a> Let us remember the question: the dwelling of the Holy Ghost in the Church as such.<a name=345:2></a> That I may not misrepresent the doctrine I combat, take -- -- -'s account of it: "A dwelling of the Holy Spirit in the Church, apart and distinct from the members, is what I confess my inability to receive.<a name=345:3></a>" Again, "But from the way in which I have heard some speak of the Person of the Holy Ghost in the individual, and distinct from this the Person of the Holy Ghost in the Church, the thought has arisen in my mind, which one almost fears to express, Do they believe in two Holy Ghosts?<a name=345:4></a>" Again, "I see these precious promises of the Spirit's abiding and presence during our Lord's absence, in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>, 15 and 16, but surely no dwelling here, nor through the Acts of the Apostles, distinct from the individual believer.<a name=345:5></a>" We have then distinctly before us the question.<a name=345:6></a> It is denied that these two things are distinctively true -- the Holy Ghost in the individual, and the Holy Ghost in the Church.<a name=345:7></a> I have found this view fully confirmed by the statement, that the blessing of the body is the aggregate of the blessing of the individual members.<a name=345:8></a> My view, which is commented on, is, "The Holy Ghost dwelling in and making one the body of Christ, and acting by every one of the members in one way or another"; and, "the Holy Ghost working in the several living members for the good of the body.<a name=345:9></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I now turn to the main point -- God's dwelling with man.<a name=345:10></a> This I believe to be the peculiar and special blessing of man, and the highest honour that could be conferred on him, unless it be his actually in glory with the Lord, when something more is added, viz.<a name=345:11></a>, being like the Lord and with Him.<a name=345:12></a> God came to walk in the garden, but Adam, a sinner, was not there to meet Him.<a name=345:13></a> But this deeply important truth is much more distinctly stated in Scripture.<a name=345:14></a> Redemption is the true ground of God's dwelling with man.<a name=345:15></a> He did not dwell with Adam; He did not dwell even with Abraham; but as soon as Israel was brought out of Egypt, and the Spirit inspired the song of triumph, what was the leading thought?<a name=345:16></a> "He is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation.<a name=345:17></a>" So in God's own preparation of it: "In the place, O Lord, which thou hast

But the answer is ready -- sent by the leaders of principal meetings to try their hand in the country, and these leaders are exclusively "the other" who are to judge; @1 Corinthians 14: 29. This is the avowed plan in some places. It would be much more honest to fall openly into the old dissenting plan, for it is nothing whatever but setting it up again, and I do not doubt there are men of God there. But my answer is, I believe in the Holy Ghost, not merely as sanctifying competent persons, but as acting as a living Person in the Church of God, and God present in the Church through the Spirit. It may be well to add here, what may perhaps seem incredible, that the authoritative explanation at Plymouth of this matter, in commenting on Mr. -- -- -'s tract and the expression "meeting the Holy Ghost," is that *they* go to meet God and not the Holy Ghost, and *we* go to meet the Holy Ghost and not God. This charge against brethren, untrue as it is, is sufficient, as well as the statement they make as to themselves, to shew their view on the subject, if view it can be called. Any comment on it here would carry me too far.

		The considerations I have just presented will have clearly pointed out to the reader the object of this paper, namely, an examination of the teaching of the word of God on the subject of the Church, and of the practical results for our souls which flow thence.<a name=359:3></a> My aim is not to examine the basis of individual salvation, although the teaching of the word on the Church throws much light on this point.<a name=359:4></a> It is even of consequence to understand that they are distinct things; for God never passes by our individual responsibility, whatever privileges may be conferred upon us by being joined to an assembly.<a name=359:5></a> We are saved as individuals, although God may, if He sees fit, gather into one body those whom He saves.<a name=359:6></a> Salvation is a thing which, though complete in Christ, supposes in the heart of the person enjoying it, personal exercises, which go on necessarily and exclusively in his own conscience, and which bring his soul into immediate connection with God, and without which all relationship with Him -- all happiness -- the very existence of spiritual life -- would be impossible.<a name=359:7></a> The intercourse between God and an intelligent and responsible soul, which before was in sin, necessarily supposes that consequent on the establishment of this new relationship many things pass within which are for that soul alone.<a name=359:8></a> The special form which the relationship takes may add much -- may give special character to it; and this is the case; but this does not do away with personal relationship.<a name=359:9></a> This is one of the essential differences between the truth of the word and the idea of the Church as it is viewed by the Romanist; who, making ordinances a means of salvation, attaches salvation to being of the Church, instead of making the Church the assembly of those who are saved.<a name=359:10></a> If but one individual were saved, his salvation would be equally perfect and sure, but <i>he</i> would not be the Church.<a name=359:11></a> This (the Church) includes an additional thought, an additional relationship, to that of the saved individual.<a name=359:12></a> What is this thought?<a name=359:13></a> Let us lay aside human definitions, and cleave to the word.<a name=359:14></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us notice the three chief points presented by <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5">Ephesians  5</a>which has suggested these reflections.<a name=361:3></a> First, Christ loved the Church, and gave Himself for it.<a name=361:4></a> It is redeemed at the cost of His blood, of His life, of Himself.<a name=361:5></a> Having thus purchased it exclusively for Himself, He begins, secondly, to fashion it, to sanctify it, that it may be according to His own heart's desire; that He may, in the third place, present it to Himself a glorious Church, without the least thing unbecoming the glory, or that might offend the eye or the heart of her divine Bridegroom.<a name=361:6></a> There is here a testimony to the divinity of Jesus, so much the more remarkable as it is only by the way; and the allusion is made as to a known truth.<a name=361:7></a> God, having formed Eve, presented her to the first Adam; but Christ Himself presents the Church to Himself; because if He be the Second Adam, He is at the same time the One who can present it to Himself as being the author of its existence, of its beauty, and of the perfection in which it must appear in heaven, to be worthy of such a Bridegroom, and of the glory that is there.<a name=361:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We will consider its history farther on: but we may already observe here, that whatever may be the circumstances through which the Church is called to pass, she is always considered as a whole, as much while she is being purified by the word upon earth, as when she is presented glorious to her Bridegroom in heaven.<a name=361:9></a> The redemption of this body by the blood of the cross was made upon earth.<a name=361:10></a> Her purification through the word, by the Spirit, also takes place on earth.<a name=361:11></a> The glorious result, at the return of Christ, will take place in heaven, for which place she will have been made ready.<a name=361:12></a> Although the marriage has not yet taken place, the relationship has always existed as to its rights.<a name=361:13></a> I do not speak merely as regards the eternal counsels of God, but in fact as to the knowledge and the duties of those who were called.<a name=361:14></a> Since Christ purchased the Church to Himself (I speak of the fact, and historically now, always allowing time for the communication of the truth as to this, by the Holy Ghost), the Church has been His, as regards the conscience of those who were called to the enjoyment

	<div class="paragraph">
		of this position.<a name=362:1></a> The relationship exists; and as Christ has always been faithful, the Church ought to have been so also.<a name=362:2></a> Her purification, on the part of Christ, had necessarily reference to this relationship, as this passage formally proves.<a name=362:3></a> It ought to have been viewed in the same light by Christians, by those who, alas!<a name=362:4></a> may fail in this relationship as in all others.<a name=362:5></a> But their responsibility is in connection with the obligations that flow from it.<a name=362:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The manner in which this truth must act upon the knowledge of an accomplished salvation, and upon sanctification, as well as upon the joy of hope, is plain.<a name=362:7></a> For with regard to the first, the existence of the Church is based on the fact that Christ has loved it, and given Himself for it.<a name=362:8></a> So that its purchase, its salvation, and the gracious, perfect love of Him who redeemed it, with the end in view, which cannot fail, of presenting it in glory to Himself, form the basis of its whole life -- of its everyday relations.<a name=362:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not a people put to the test, by a rule given.<a name=362:10></a> The Church is the object of a perfect work, through which Christ purchased it to Himself, when it was enslaved to Satan, defiled, and guilty.<a name=362:11></a> It has no other responsibility, as the Church, but that which is based on its being the purchase of Christ.<a name=362:12></a> This tells her, no doubt, that she ought to be entirely His; but if she ought to be His, it is because she is so already.<a name=362:13></a> The Christian, instructed of God in this doctrine, has the peaceful assurance (an assurance which gives a calmness that is the basis of the sweetest affections) that he belongs to Christ, according to God's perfect love, and the efficacy of a work in which Christ -- that His heart might have satisfaction in the object which the Father had given Him -- could not fail.<a name=362:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The influence of this truth in the conscience is equally great as regards sanctification; for it is the purification of that which already belongs to Christ in an absolute manner, in order that it may be fit to live with Him for ever, a purification which extends consequently to the thoughts, the affections, and the manner of viewing things in all respects.<a name=362:15></a> Being wholly His, the Church has to do with Him in each movement of the heart, in each sentiment; if not, she fails in her relationship with Him, in every circumstance in which it is not so.<a name=362:16></a> As to the result which He has in view, He will certainly no more fail in that, thanks be unto God, than He has with regard to the

		redemption.<a name=363:1></a> He will present the Church to Himself without spot or wrinkle.<a name=363:2></a> But the heart of the Christian ought to respond to that work.<a name=363:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The influence of the relationship of the Church with Christ upon her hope, is no less great.<a name=363:4></a> She is outside the judgments which the coming of the Lord will bring upon the world -- outside the course of the prophetic events which will take place in a world of which she forms no longer part.<a name=363:5></a> She awaits the happy moment when the Lord will call her, taking her to Himself to realize the glory and the joy of the relationship which she already knows by grace.<a name=363:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such is the position of the Church, and her relationship with Christ.<a name=363:7></a> But there is a consequence resulting from these, the figure of which we have seen in the connection in which Eve was placed with the creation, but on which I will make a few more remarks by the way.<a name=363:8></a> Christ says, the apostle, in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1">Ephesians  1</a>, is the Head of the Church, "which is his body, the fulness of [or that which makes complete] him that filleth all in all"; that is to say, Christ is the Head, and the Church the body; and as the body is the complement of the head to make up a man, so it is with Christ and the Church: He as Head directing, exercising all authority over the Church, His body -- but the Church, as the body, rendering complete <i>the</i> mystical man, according to the eternal counsels of God.<a name=363:9></a> For it is evident that this is no question about the divine Person of Christ, but in the counsels of God, Christ, as Head, would not have been complete without the Church.<a name=363:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us remark by the way, that it is this thought which was completely hid (hid in God) under the old covenant; and which is not found in the whole of the Old Testament.<a name=363:11></a> The idea of a Christ not perfect, simply in His own Person, as an individual, would have been unintelligible to the most advanced saint of the Old Testament.<a name=363:12></a> There was to be blessing under His government -- but the being a part of the Christ, as a member of His body would have been incomprehensible.<a name=363:13></a> The union between Jew and Gentile, which flows from it, will come before us afterwards.<a name=363:14></a> Now the effect of such a union of the Church with Christ, has been to associate the Church in His dominion over all things and with all His glory, such as He received it as Mediator from His Father.<a name=363:15></a> And such is the force even of <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:21">Ephesians  1:21</a>, 22, which we have just quoted.<a name=363:16></a> That is why he sets forth the members of the Church as a

	<div class="paragraph">
		After this short review of the position of the Church with regard to Christ, and the whole creation which will be subjected to Him, we will consider, in a more consecutive manner, the doctrine of the word respecting the Church itself, and then the position it holds historically in those ways of God, the course of which is given to us in detail in the Bible.<a name=364:13></a>

It is well to bear in mind that the Revelation was written long after the destruction of Jerusalem.
	</div>
	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#365:f2"><sup>++</sup></a> This declaration of the Lord (@Matthew 16) has a very decisive character, if we consider the circumstances under which it was uttered. In the beginning of the chapter He had pronounced the judgment of the Jewish generation, giving them His death, under the figure of Jonas, as the sign; and leaving to themselves those who were seeking a sign. Then He asked His disciples what was said of Him. Peter, on this occasion, makes the unique confession: "Thou art the Christ, *the Son of the living God*." This latter part is only found on this occasion, and it is what gives its peculiar importance to this confession. The Son of the *living God*, in building His Church, would shelter it from the power of Hades and of him who had the power of death. The death of the Messiah might break the links between Israel after the flesh and the head of their blessing, whatever grace might do afterwards for that nation; but whatever was based on the power of the resurrection (and it is in resurrection that Christ has been declared the Son of God with power) was secured against him, who, at the most, had the power of death. Peter is always full of this idea of life (@1 Peter 1: 3, 21, 23, 24; chapter 2: 4, 5). @Matthew 17 adds the millennial glory of the Son of man; and towards the end, leading His disciples back to the subject of His rejection amongst the Jews, explains the ways of grace, and on this occasion introduces Church action (chapter 18: 17).

		I will not go over the infinitely precious teaching of chapter 5 again, because I have already called the attention of the reader to this portion in beginning our thesis; but it is clear that the epistle to the Ephesians treats the subject of a Church which is one body, whose Head is Christ -- a body formed and developed upon earth, since the ascension of Jesus, by the Holy Ghost sent from above who makes it His habitation -- a body in which the glory of God will be reflected throughout all ages -- a body which is the vessel upon earth of the Spirit, which He who, having gained the victory over Satan, and established the glory of His redemption everywhere, from death up to the throne of the Father, has sent to be the testimony of the power through which He has overcome; and who associates the Church with its Head in the heavens, giving it a heavenly calling, as being seated there in Him.<a name=377:14></a> This body, formed in its perfection at the beginning, was to grow by the energy of the Holy Spirit which dwelt in it, just as a child, perfect in all its parts, grows through the power of the life which is in him, in order to attain to the state of manhood.<a name=377:15></a>

		instructions on the subject we are considering.<a name=378:1></a> The epistle to the Ephesians has taught us that God would gather together all things in Christ, and that the Church was united to Him as His body, associated with Him in His dominion over all things.<a name=378:2></a> The epistle to the Colossians teaches us the same truth under another aspect.<a name=378:3></a> We shall also find that the idea of Christ which is presented in chapter I contrasts with all that He was as the hope of the Jews, according to the testimony of the prophets, as much as that which is found in the epistle to the Ephesians, but in a different manner.<a name=378:4></a> Let us first look at what is said of the double glory of Christ -- Head over all things, and Head of the Church.<a name=378:5></a> In verses 15 and 16 He is presented as the First-born of every creature; and the reason if it is given -- He has created all things.<a name=378:6></a> He who had created all things, having taken His place as a man in the midst of the creation, must at all events be the Head of it.<a name=378:7></a> This thought is confirmed in verse 17.<a name=378:8></a> The second part of the glory of Christ is declared in verse 18.<a name=378:9></a> He is the Head of the body, the Church; who is the beginning, the Firstborn from the dead.<a name=378:10></a> These are the two truths presented in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:22">Ephesians  1:22</a>, 23; only the two things are considered separately here as two diverse glories of Christ, in whom it has pleased all the fulness to dwell.<a name=378:11></a> The <i>reconciliation</i> of all things and of the Church follows.<a name=378:12></a> Having made peace through the blood of His cross, the thought of God is to reconcile all things through Him, whether they be things in earth or things in heaven.<a name=378:13></a> This answers to verse 16.<a name=378:14></a> Then the apostle, addressing the Christians called at Colosse, says to them, "And you that were sometime alienated .<a name=378:15></a>.<a name=378:16></a>.<a name=378:17></a> yet now hath he reconciled.<a name=378:18></a>" This answers to verse 18.<a name=378:19></a> They were part of the Church of which Christ was the Head, and of which the reconciliation takes place now.<a name=378:20></a> Verses 24 and 25 present, as following this distinction of the double glory of Christ and the double reconciliation, a double ministry -- the ministry of the gospel to every creature under heaven, and the ministry of the Church, which is the body of Christ.<a name=378:21></a> This ministry, a complement in its doctrine of all the preceding revelations, completed the teaching of the word of God (verse 24-26).<a name=378:22></a> The Church was a mystery which had been hid from ages and from generations -- a mystery which admitted the Gentiles into all the privileges which it revealed, and spoke of a Christ, not the crown and accomplishment of the glory of the Jews, but who, in the Gentiles, or in the midst of the

		I confine myself to the doctrine; adding that the epistle, as a whole, shews that the Colossians were in danger of losing sight of their close union with the Head of the body -- Christ, in whom everything was accomplished, and they complete in Him; and of seeking, by forgetting this truth, to add something else, which was nothing but the setting aside of Him.<a name=379:11></a> Consequently, the epistle brings into prominence the riches and the perfection of Christ to remind the Colossians of them; whilst the Ephesians, who held fast the faith of their union with Him, were able to profit by the teaching which revealed to them the whole extent of their own privileges.<a name=379:12></a> The faithfulness of the one, and the unfaithfulness of the other, have both turned, in the hand of our God, to the blessing of the Church in all ages.<a name=379:13></a>

This is evidently not a question as to the existence of the Holy Ghost as a Person; but since He was now come down and His presence was upon earth, in consequence of the redemption and the glory of Christ, this presence was to them the Holy Ghost. The same expression occurs in @Acts 19: "We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost." They had been told by certain disciples of John the Baptist, that the Lamb of God would baptise them with the Holy Ghost; and what they said to Paul was, that, not only had they not received Him, but that they did not know whether He was yet.

		The writings of Paul, who was chosen to bear this testimony and to preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ -- a ministry which was connected with these truths -- are full of this doctrine; bringing into prominence this glory of Christ, which was beyond all that the prophets had spoken.<a name=386:3></a> Thus <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#3:16">1 Timothy  3:16</a>.<a name=386:4></a> Having spoken of the Church, in a passage already quoted, he naturally turns to the truth of which the Church was the pillar -- this mystery of godliness.<a name=386:5></a> A Messiah, the fulfilment of the prophecies, was not a mystery; but a Christ such as the apostle presents Him in verse 16 had never been known before: "God manifested in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.<a name=386:6></a>" Certain elements found here were connected with Messiah upon earth: because this same Messiah, ascended up on high, must come down again to fulfil the promises made to the Jews; but such things as a whole, had never been presented to faith.<a name=386:7></a>

		As to the Church, the thing is true in a still more absolute manner.<a name=386:8></a> This is what the apostle says of it, <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:9">Ephesians  3:9</a>-11: "And to make all see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ: to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known, by the Church, the manifold wisdom of God, according to the eternal purpose which He purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord.<a name=386:9></a>" It is impossible to get anything more absolute than "hid in God.<a name=386:10></a>" This mystery of the Church, hid in the depths of His counsels, did not get disclosed, nor did she exist in fact, till then.<a name=386:11></a> It is "<i>now</i>," that unto the principalities and powers is made known, by the Church, the manifold wisdom of God.<a name=386:12></a> They had seen His patience, His power, His government; but never a heavenly body upon the earth, united to His Son in heaven.<a name=386:13></a> Thus God could set aside, for the time, the course of His earthly government, to enter into relationship with a heavenly people.<a name=386:14></a> This passage is very clear on this point; that the Church neither existed nor was revealed before.<a name=386:15></a> Up to that time it was a mystery hid in God; who,

		The truth of the union of Jews and Gentiles in one body, the Church, is established, as the consequence of the cross, in verses 14 and 15, in the most formal manner.<a name=387:8></a> The middle wall of partition, established by God Himself and absolutely binding, had been broken down only by the cross; and by means of this, also, they were both reconciled in one body -- those who were afar off, and those who were nigh.<a name=387:9></a> Then, they had been built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets.<a name=387:10></a> That is, the Church could exist only after the cross had rendered possible the union of Jews and Gentiles<a href="#387:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>.<a name=387:11></a> The enmity of man against God having been manifested, the enmity of his nature -- Jew or Gentile -- and the Jews having lost all title to the enjoyment of the promises, grace received in a sovereign manner both the one and the other, according to the eternal counsels of God, for a better inheritance.<a name=387:12></a> God (having been manifested in the flesh, and having set things on the footing of eternal realities outside all earthly economy or dispensation, and, received up into glory, having acquired a people which was associated to Himself according to the election of God) purposed, before the foundation of the world, that He should share this glory with His bride and His body.<a name=387:13></a>

I recall the expression already quoted, "minister of the Church to fulfil [complete] the word of God." There was yet wanting to this word something of the revelations willed of God, namely, the Church. God made use of the apostle Paul to administer this truth.
