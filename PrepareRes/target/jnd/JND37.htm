		THE LAST DAYS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The term "Last Days" is a word not without importance, as common to both the Old and New Testament -- very common in the Old.<a name=1:1></a> There it is constantly accompanied with promises.<a name=1:2></a> "The mountain of the Lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains"; He would "pour out his Spirit on all flesh"; this last, however, though quoted by Peter as in the last days, is in <a href="../bible/Joel.htm#2:28">Joel  2:28</a>, "thereupon" or "afterwards".<a name=1:3></a> Still it is quite the last days, the Northern army being removed.<a name=1:4></a> Still it would be a time of trouble to break them down.<a name=1:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Prophets having spoken to Israel or Judah, in the last of these days, i.<a name=1:6></a>e.<a name=1:7></a>, in the patient ways of God when really responsible Israel had failed, God spoke in the Son -- the Law and Prophets had been till John.<a name=1:8></a> Then the Kingdom was announced as to be set up.<a name=1:9></a> Thus the last days set in.<a name=1:10></a> Till Israel rejected Christ in the world, and even till the glorified Christ was rejected, His return was promised -- the closing in in blessing was held out as possible -- the Spirit was poured out -- Messiah would have come back; so that this was "The last days".<a name=1:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		For a moment the blessing and power then eclipsed dispensations, but this soon failed, and prophecies of the last days, as they now concerned the Church, came to it in its turn.<a name=1:12></a> Then we read, "In the last days perilous times shall come" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#3">2 Timothy  3</a>); "In the last times some shall depart from the faith" (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#4">1 Timothy  4</a>); "In the last days there shall be scoffers" (<a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#3">2 Peter  3</a>); so <a href="../bible/Jude.htm#18">Jude  18</a>.<a name=1:13></a> "In the last time" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:18">1 John  2:18</a>) is more definite -- Antichrist characterises the last time, and there were many already.<a name=1:14></a> Antichrist denied the Father and the Son -- rejected, or was apostate, from Christianity -- and the liar denied Jesus to be the Christ.<a name=1:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There was Christian apostasy and Jewish unbelief, but there are, remark, no promises connected with the testimony of the last days as to Christianity.<a name=1:16></a> That day -- the day of the Lord -- will be darkness and judgment for the Jews -- it is "The day of Jacob's trouble", but he will be delivered out of it.<a name=1:17></a> Hence there are blessings and promises which accompany it, as we have seen, and both temporal and spiritual ones, but there is no restoration of Christendom.<a name=1:18></a> The Remnant of course will go up to heaven to meet the Lord, but the system is for ever

		cut off and not restored at all -- Israel is by grace, though not by the old covenant.<a name=2:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What is given us, however, of the last days, or time, in Christianity is its character, not its judgment.<a name=2:2></a> The "last time" is denoted by open rejection and apostasy -- John giving its ultimate form, "They went out from us".<a name=2:3></a> The "last days" then is "the form of Godliness, denying the power", "turning the grace of God into lasciviousness", "scoffing at the Lord's coming".<a name=2:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The "latter times" in <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#4">1 Timothy  4</a>is a more general expression, and not of the final character of evil in the Church, though it may continue to the end -- it is <i>husterois kairois</i> (latter times).<a name=2:5></a> Though <i>husteros</i> compared with others, is "the last", yet both <i>eschatos</i> (last, uttermost) and <i>hemera</i> (day) are more defined and precise.<a name=2:6></a> But the main point is, that no blessing is spoken of as accompanying them.<a name=2:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#24:14">Numbers  24:14</a> and <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#4:30">Deuteronomy  4:30</a>, clear up the expression.<a name=2:8></a> <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#49">Genesis  49</a>gives the whole history of Israel, as a result, to the end.<a name=2:9></a> <i>Ah-Ghareeth Yohm</i> (in the latter days) is the constant expression in the Old Testament; in <a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#23:20">Jeremiah  23:20</a> it is the same.<a name=2:10></a>

		In a certain sense, i.<a name=2:11></a>e.<a name=2:12></a>, as regards man's position here below, the Law or Word creates the way, as noted as to Christ in John; for there is no way in a fallen world whose whole state, in relation to God, is evil.<a name=2:13></a> But He can show a new way, which is the expression of His will, in those that are His in this world.<a name=2:14></a> It will make them strangers, and so it always has, as we see in the Psalms, and from Abel on.<a name=2:15></a> The difference of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#119">Psalm  119</a>and Christ is, that that is a way for the world in it, looking for deliverance -- Christ, a heavenly way out of it.<a name=2:16></a>

		THE PSALMS(~)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a very important point indeed as to the understanding the application of the Psalms, that, in the Psalms, as remarked elsewhere, when sufferings from men are spoken of vengeance is always called for by the speaker.<a name=3:1></a> In Christ's life historically there never was a trace of this but the contrary -- on the Cross He prays they may be forgiven -- in His lifetime rebukes the disciples for thinking of it, as not knowing what spirit they were of.<a name=3:2></a> It is evident that this is of the greatest weight in our judgment of the manner of application to Christ.<a name=3:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<hr>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another very important point I notice.<a name=3:4></a> In every way the first Book is characterised by Christ's position when on earth.<a name=3:5></a> The first two Psalms no doubt take up the Remnant, and the purpose of God as to Christ, Son of God and King in Zion, but He is seen as rejected in fact, and all the Psalms go on from this point -- in that part closing with His place as Son of Man, Jehovah having set His glory above the heavens.<a name=3:6></a> But, all through, Jehovah is looked to in the celebration of what takes place, not King Messiah on earth.<a name=3:7></a> The only allusion to it is in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#18">Psalm  18</a>, where all the history is gone through, but the subject is His humiliation, and the latter part is prophetic of His David victorious character.<a name=3:8></a> But Christ's glory is heavenly (as <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#21">Psalm  21</a>) as a thing celebrated, and Jehovah the Deliverer.<a name=3:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the second Book we have Him as the King, forming the centre of the first part of it in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#45">Psalm  45</a>, and then Jerusalem is delivered.<a name=3:10></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#51">Psalm  51</a>starts afresh, not with confession of sins against Jehovah, but with blood-guiltiness, i.<a name=3:11></a>e.<a name=3:12></a>, Christ's being put to death, and thence all is "God" not "Jehovah".<a name=3:13></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#68">Psalm  68</a>, Christ has been exalted, and the Lord God is to

		dwell among them, and the summons of Numbers is used for the dispersion of all enemies.<a name=4:1></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#69">Psalm  69</a>we have Christ's sorrows down here in connection with Israel -- Israel grown old (David) is not to be forgotten, and the King's son, Solomon, is set up in the millennium.<a name=4:2></a> It is Messiah, Son of David, and Jewish deliverance, not Christ's heavenly exaltation on His rejection -- that had taken place, and was, for Jah, Elohim dwelling among the rebellious.<a name=4:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first Book is the gospel view of Christ's position on earth and on high -- such as Peter might preach.<a name=4:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second Book is prophetic, and the cast out Jews, with whom He has had sympathy, looking for restoration.<a name=4:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The third Book, as often noticed, is the general expectation of Israel (as well as Judah) where blood-guiltiness indeed was not.<a name=4:6></a> They are in the land, as in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#18">Isaiah  18</a>, but suffering under the Gentiles and the judgment of God, but conscious that God has interfered in their favour, judging "among the gods", the lofty ones "set in slippery places", and they going up to the tabernacle of God, or at least looking to it with desire -- Zion, the centre of all their hopes, His foundation.<a name=4:7></a> In the last two Psalms of the Book we have the distress of the soul, though looking to Jehovah for salvation, under the terrors of the Law, and the sure promises of David in grace, and faithfulness in Christ as remarked.<a name=4:8></a> "Holy One" (verse 19, <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#89">Psalm  89</a>) is the singular of the word translated "mercies" in verse 1.<a name=4:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the fourth Book we have Jehovah, Israel's dwelling place always.<a name=4:10></a> But now they have been long afflicted, and they look for present mercy in a short life from Him with whom time is nothing.<a name=4:11></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#91">Psalm  91</a>, "Most High" being the supreme and millennial name of God, the question is "Which is the Most High?<a name=4:12></a>" He who can tell will have the blessing of Abraham's God.<a name=4:13></a> The godly man, Messiah especially, takes Jehovah; and Israel, and Jehovah Himself own the secret of faith, and blessing is found.<a name=4:14></a> This introduces, in the well-known secret which follows, millennial blessing and glory.<a name=4:15></a> But it is "Jehovah" who comes, "Jehovah" all through; <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#101">Psalm  101</a>and 102 bring in Messiah as Man, but owned at the end of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#102">Psalm  102</a>as Jehovah Himself.<a name=4:16></a> All this is remarkable.<a name=4:17></a> As in <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#7">Daniel  7</a>, so everywhere, this wonderful truth of Christ being Jehovah shines out more and more in Old and New Testaments.<a name=4:18></a> In 1 John, for example, there as God; <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#103">Psalm  103</a>, 104, 105, 106, the ways of Jehovah -- first grace and mercy with Israel,

		then Creation glory, and judgment to deliver them -- His faithful mercy from Abraham -- His mercy to them after failure, and looking to Him for restoration -- <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#101">Psalm  101</a>, and partly 102; it is Jehovah, not His anointed.<a name=5:1></a>

		I think we shall find, all through the Psalms, two classes -- one, the faith which looks to God, and trusts Him, and pleads for an answer in righteousness -- and the second, the cry out of distress, and in distress of heart under it, though the principle of faith be in the cry.<a name=5:2></a> I remember attributing the former more to Christ, the latter to the Remnant.<a name=5:3></a> Now in the spirit and character of these this is true, but the exclusive distinction of them to one or the other is wrong.<a name=5:4></a> They are all the Remnant, only in two different aspects -- only one more fully and directly the Spirit of Christ; though in Gethsemane He did cry in distress to God.<a name=5:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<hr>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The connection with the Jewish Remnant is ever more clear, and more important to me in the Psalms -- Christ identifying Himself with that Remnant, important because it is His character as Christ with Jehovah, which is necessarily modified in the Gospels, never indeed directly presented, because He is Son of Man and Son of God there, and Emmanuel if He is in the midst of the Jews, and Jesus.<a name=5:6></a> (The only place He directly declares Himself "the Christ", is in <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>, to the woman of Samaria.<a name=5:7></a>) Hence the difference, as often remarked, of the desire of judgment, and the grace which is in the Gospel.<a name=5:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<hr>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The clue indeed to the Psalms is to see the Remnant in the presence of the day of the Lord.<a name=5:9></a> God will then execute His judgment in order to set His Son King in Zion.<a name=5:10></a> Thus also we learn how far Christ has taken a place amongst them, or at least has one.<a name=5:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<hr>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is clear that the Psalms address themselves naturally to a people in relationship with God, to a people under the law,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=6>[Page 6]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		though they may be driven out; only keepers of it are distinguished.<a name=6:1></a> They present the godly Remnant, and the heathen raging against Jehovah and His anointed.<a name=6:2></a> But there is no morning Star in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>, naturally.<a name=6:3></a> Note how very clear the character and resulting position of the Remnant, and Jesus rejected, exalted as <i>Adonai</i> (Lord) and finally reigning, is in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#1">Psalm  1</a>and 2.<a name=6:4></a> The Christian place left out, but what a place it does give us!<a name=6:5></a> Compare <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#110">Psalm  110</a>as to <i>Adonai's</i> place, and then <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#6">Isaiah  6</a>.<a name=6:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus the Psalms not only suppose a godly Remnant, distinct from the mass of the nation, but suppose the deliberate hostility of the ungodly, Satan-led party against Messiah, and the godly who follow Him, so as not only to give the latter-day state, but also that of the time of Christ, and hence so much, besides direct prophecy, applies to Him as to the moral state -- not as to Him personally perhaps, but as to that in which He was, and the Spirit which animated Him in it, for indeed His Spirit had provided for them, and He came and put Himself in their place.<a name=6:7></a> This arranged opposition is important to remark in the Psalms.<a name=6:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<hr>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Psalms -- so Hannah's song, etc.<a name=6:9></a>, are the first introduction of the Remnant, on the failure of judicial and priestly economy, under Jehovah as their King -- the only right thing short of Christ, and therefore introducing, in the hope and joy of the Remnant, at once the King, the Anointed (for prophecy was but a ministration of testimony) -- Samuel when weaned from his mother, to be "before the Lord for ever".<a name=6:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So all the Psalms are testimonies not of the Spirit from Jehovah to the people, but the Spirit of Christ in the Remnant towards Jehovah.<a name=6:11></a> You may sometimes see it speaking in the prophets as in Christ and them, but it is always prophetically -- "I fed the poor of the flock", "I and the children which God hath given me are for signs and wonders, etc".<a name=6:12></a> -- so that it is still the same prophetic testimony; they knew that it was the Word of the Lord, but here it is the effect in the believing Remnant, and therefore in its highest character in Christ, which place, that He might be in them by His Spirit -- take His place among them and lead them in Spirit, He expressly takes in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16">Psalm  16</a>, which is just its force.<a name=6:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

		Psalms; it amounts to prophecy when it is the actual expression of Christ's Spirit in the circumstances in which He was to be placed; still it was what He felt, and not what was declared about Him.<a name=7:1></a> "Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption" -- we are not aware how.<a name=7:2></a> It is taking Jehovah as God that is so marked in the Psalms; i.<a name=7:3></a>e.<a name=7:4></a>, the God of the Jews as the true God, "Who is God save Jehovah?<a name=7:5></a>" The Lord quite merges this.<a name=7:6></a> There are also often, I should add, answers by the Spirit to Messiah, so placed as in the Psalms, and expressing His mind holily therein; and also identification of Him with Jehovah, as in the New Testament with the Father.<a name=7:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The more we seize the idea that it is the Jewish Remnant with which Christ, entirely Man yet shown to be Jehovah, identifies Himself, the more we shall seize the meaning of the Psalms, and understand the path of Christ Himself.<a name=7:8></a> Thus even in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16">Psalm  16</a>, where we have the life of Christ in its divine principles so distinctly and blessedly brought forth, still He is among Jews and fidelity to Jehovah characterises Him, see verse 4.<a name=7:9></a> Note the characteristics of this life.<a name=7:10></a> First He takes His place as Man, properly Man, and trusts in God, counting Jehovah as His Lord, and taking His place among the saints.<a name=7:11></a> Jehovah is the portion of His inheritance and His cup -- Jehovah counsels Him, He blesses Him for it -- He sets Jehovah before His face, and trusts His help, whatever come, even through death which did not affect this life nor Jehovah's power -- He looks up the path of life to Jehovah's presence.<a name=7:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first Book Christ is presented in His title of righteousness, and, according to the counsels of God, association with the Remnant pointed out, and its state, and then the full result in the counsels of God, <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8">Psalm  8</a>-- then Christ in the place He took, <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16">Psalm  16</a>, 17 and 18 -- the thoughts, feelings, judgment of the saint, and, at the end, how Christ came down into the place He did, setting aside the Jewish figures, and laying the ground of righteousness Himself.<a name=7:13></a> The result and holy wisdom of owning Him is in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#12">Psalm  12</a>.<a name=7:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The second Book is somewhat different, though there is an analogy.<a name=8:1></a> It begins not with Christ but with the condition of the Remnant, and hence has more for its subject the facts of the latter day, Israel being driven out.<a name=8:2></a> The change takes place by the introduction of a triumphant Messiah, and the Remnant thereupon in renewed relationship with the God of Jacob.<a name=8:3></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#49">Psalm  49</a>is a commentary or improvement founded on it.<a name=8:4></a> But then the great public meaning of all the great scene of God's dealings is brought in -- God judges His people and the world -- He gathers those who come to His covenant by sacrifice, the Jewish ones being set aside as of any avail -- the Remnant come in on the confession of their guilt in the death of Christ, and then sacrifices of righteousness are offered.<a name=8:5></a> The internal state is thus gone into -- the outward oppression and inward state of the Jews, as judged by Christ and displayed in Judas and Antichrist, see <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#55">Psalm  55</a>, 56, 57 and 58; but God comes in in answer to all this, and the state of things is judged, and blessing comes from Him who is power.<a name=8:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But then another truth is brought out -- the exaltation of Christ, His ascension, and thus the full blessing and triumph of Israel is brought in; but for this (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#69">Psalm  69</a>) the humiliation of Christ, and the conduct of the Jews is brought out.<a name=8:7></a> The appeal of Christ, and His connection with Israel, deprived of strength, is presented to us in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#70">Psalm  70</a>and 71, and His Solomon reign in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#72">Psalm  72</a>.<a name=8:8></a> The details will come hereafter.<a name=8:9></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#62">Psalm  62</a>and 63 Christ is against introduced -- He waits on God, and desires God when there is nought else, and no access to the Sanctuary.<a name=8:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the third Book, God, good to Israel, to such as are of a clean heart, is the theme.<a name=8:11></a> The public attacks of the outward enemies in the latter day, the judgment of God, and Christ's taking part in the sorrow and in the burden and curse, are brought out in order to complete deliverance in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#89">Psalm  89</a>.<a name=8:12></a> He (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#87">Psalm  87</a>) being reckoned to Sion as her Son, who then does not shrink from comparison with all the world's glory.<a name=8:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the third Book requires some further remarks.<a name=8:14></a> There can be nothing without Christ.<a name=8:15></a> But Christ is not the subject of this as in the two first, neither as the direct object as in Book 1, nor as the answer to need, as in Book 2.<a name=8:16></a> Christ was among the Jews, and here we get back to Israel, who can have nothing without Him, and all whose hope is founded on Him.<a name=8:17></a> But Christ was among the Jews, not in Israel, properly speaking.<a name=8:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here then we have not David, save in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#86">Psalm  86</a>and perhaps two others.<a name=9:1></a> But Asaph, and the spirit, and subjects of the psalms are different -- not the sorrows and sufferings of a sympathising Messiah, and a Remnant associated with Him, but grace giving to Israel what they had forfeited, and hence the former deliverances of God referred to -- the account of the loss of all by their conduct -- the calling of David -- still His throne cast down too.<a name=9:2></a> Hence the inroad of outward enemies, against even restored Israel, is narrated.<a name=9:3></a> But great principles of God's dealings and government are brought out, "Truly God is good to Israel" -- there is favour and grace.<a name=9:4></a> But the distinction of those clean in heart is made.<a name=9:5></a> Faith is tried by the prosperity of the wicked, which the sanctuary alone explains.<a name=9:6></a> God's judgment explains all, <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#75">Psalm  75</a>and 76; in the latter, Christ also will take the seat of judgment.<a name=9:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Meanwhile ancient deliverances are referred to, which were of grace, and of all Israel, as <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#77">Psalm  77</a>and the whole of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#80">Psalm  80</a>.<a name=9:8></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#78">Psalm  78</a>explains how and why they had been judged, and the rejection of the natural Heir, and God's electing grace the means of bringing in blessing.<a name=9:9></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#81">Psalm  81</a>, the new moon of Israel's restoration appears -- it recalls again deliverance from Egypt, and again we have judgment of the judges, and the last inroads.<a name=9:10></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#86">Psalm  86</a>, where we find David, and Christ identifying Himself with Israel and its sorrows, it is as God's witness against false gods, "All nations .<a name=9:11></a>.<a name=9:12></a>.<a name=9:13></a> shall come and worship".<a name=9:14></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#87">Psalm  87</a>, He is reckoned to Zion; in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#88">Psalm  88</a>, He bears the whole wrath against the people; and in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#89">Psalm  89</a>, He centres all Jehovah's mercies for them in Himself, on which the appeal for the intervention of Jehovah, according to His promise to David's seed, is founded.<a name=9:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The fourth Book rests, for the full blessing of Israel, on the unchangeable and eternal character of Jehovah their God.<a name=9:16></a> In eternity God, He had been in all generations their dwelling place.<a name=9:17></a> Upon man's changingness, and vanity of life, and the stability of the being of Him, with whom a thousand years is but as yesterday when it is passed, the Spirit of Christ in the believing Remnant turns to look for His redemption who had always been their dwelling place.<a name=9:18></a> He had set their secret sins in the light of His countenance -- His anger consumed them -- they look for mercy.<a name=9:19></a> It is the introductory cry founded on the faith which looked quite back, and to Jehovah as always their dwelling place.<a name=9:20></a>

		The whole of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#69">Psalm  69</a>shows the righteous One in presence of human evil and wrong.<a name=26:3></a> The position contemplated is, Israel under the rebuke of God.<a name=26:4></a> They are driven out, and the enemy triumphs at Jerusalem, yet the righteous had their sorrows, as being Israel at heart.<a name=26:5></a> The moral position is the one we have always seen of the Remnant -- confession of sin, and assertion of integrity at the same time; into this Christ surely entered as bearing their sorrows, and so far can speak of their sins, but the position is that of the Remnant.<a name=26:6></a> On the other hand, the expressions of integrity and sorrow, though general, have found their fullest, and in some parts literal, accomplishment in Christ, for He entered, in the most perfect way, into the sorrows of the Remnant, whether as walking amongst the people as He long did, or cast out as He was at the close; and hence, from His last journey, when He walked no more openly among them, takes up the sorrows of the cast out state.<a name=26:7></a> This went on to the close of all, but is not Atonement nor divine wrath, but sorrow in which He takes part -- verse 26 is not, I am well assured, atonement but chastisement on Israel, governmental punishment in which Israel will be in the latter day, as we have seen in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#20">Psalm  20</a>and 21 (compared with <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22">Psalm  22</a>).<a name=26:8></a> It is not grace, but judgment demanded.<a name=26:9></a> God had smitten Israel -- the wicked triumph over him; Christ in grace enters into this place, and they triumph over him.<a name=26:10></a> But it is the people's wrong which is the great subject here, leading to the exaltation of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#68">Psalm  68</a>.<a name=26:11></a>

		The atonement on the Cross brings grace -- the blood speaks better things than that of Abel, while, in government, it is on the Jews and on their children; we must always make this distinction.<a name=26:12></a> Yet Christ's entering into their sorrows (expiation being made) is the cause and way of their deliverance, through His exaltation as the Poor among the people, see here verse 32; so also <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#34:6">Psalm  34:6</a>; compare Peter's preaching to Israel, <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#3">Acts  3</a>-- with Christ's intercession, "they know not what they do".<a name=26:13></a>

		<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#69">Psalm  69</a>however brings out another element -- that though there is perfect sympathy and entering into the condition, yet He takes it on His heart alone.<a name=27:8></a> He takes the sorrow on Himself -- no one enters into His feelings about it, though He for all.<a name=27:9></a> This is the true spirit of grace -- to bear alone for others what others do not even know we are bearing, for their good -- the credit of it all with God alone; see verses 4 and 5.<a name=27:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I think we may easily see when the Lord entered into the present realisation of His position as rejected -- no doubt He really always was.<a name=27:11></a> This, as a great truth morally, John begins with, but we read, "From that time Jesus began to teach his disciples, the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation", etc.<a name=27:12></a> He then began to tell them what He surely knew, but He lived, so to speak, at first, in the presentation of Himself to Israel, saying "Blessed are the eyes", etc.<a name=27:13></a> (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10:23">Luke  10:23</a>, 24), at the close in His rejection by Israel He was forced to say "Woe, woe".<a name=27:14></a> The transfiguration was a turning point -- it was the new glory in answer to the sufferings.<a name=27:15></a> And so the return of the twelve from their mission -- He then desired the twelve to say no more that He was the Christ.<a name=27:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		However note in all this, though no doubt it included all, yet the suffering is looked at as from "this generation".<a name=27:17></a> The atonement part, therein accomplished, was between Him and God.<a name=27:18></a> It required the Holy Ghost to make that clear to the disciples, though indeed He told them it was so.<a name=27:19></a> It is well to

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		note this -- that the great mass of Christ's sufferings were human sufferings -- the perfection of them, but human which try, form, or prove perfectness, but are not in themselves atonement.<a name=28:1></a> This, as we have seen in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#20">Psalm  20</a>- 22, the Remnant, as such, did not enter into, yet Christ suffered the governmental consequences of sin, and in heart, taking them on His heart for Israel; but here it is suffering with them, i.<a name=28:2></a>e.<a name=28:3></a>, as they will suffer -- leading their thoughts in this for them.<a name=28:4></a> It is only after, when they see Jesus, that they see the real atoning power of His work.<a name=28:5></a> "They look on him whom they pierced" -- till then they cried to Jehovah under the pressure of governmental discipline of sin, suffering at the same time because of their integrity.<a name=28:6></a> It is this place that the Lord constantly takes in the Psalms -- identifying Himself perfectly with Israel, i.<a name=28:7></a>e.<a name=28:8></a>, the godly Remnant.<a name=28:9></a> His atonement, as we have said, must be between Him and God alone -- hence we have so seen it in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22">Psalm  22</a>, where He speaks Himself, and the result is all grace, not merely governmental.<a name=28:10></a> Here the indignation and wrath comes in without an atoning character -- "In all their affliction he was afflicted, the Angel of his presence succoured them".<a name=28:11></a> Atonement comes by substitution, a different thing from being afflicted in their affliction, and succouring them.<a name=28:12></a> So when we read of "rebuking in wrath", "chastening in sore displeasure" we have governmental.<a name=28:13></a> The very sense which Christ had of the favour of God, even in connection with His people, made this terrible to Him; hence it runs on even into His death, and the ungodly nation are the instruments of it as well as the heathen -- it is in every way His "own familiar friend".<a name=28:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the circumstances of Christ's life were so ordered, that they were a personal realisation of all this, and here the Psalms become, when the Spirit reaches this point, personally prophetic, but do not leave therefore the position of Israel, because it is "in their affliction" He is afflicted.<a name=28:15></a> Atonement is quite another work.<a name=28:16></a> Wicked men are the instruments of the former sufferings, yet, in the way of government, they are wrath and indignation from God, or may be for me -- I may suffer for righteousness.<a name=28:17></a> This we find at the beginning of Christ's life, independent of chastening on Israel, but into this Christ entered in Spirit, because He identified Himself with Israel.<a name=28:18></a> He came, apart from the sin, as a "Holy thing" born, and as holy was capable, in love and grace, to enter into it in the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=29>[Page 29]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		power of that love and grace, but then He came as a Man so as to feel it Himself, but with the Remnant who felt the sorrow of it, and owned the cause -- the sins of Israel; for the confession of sin is the spirit of righteousness.<a name=29:1></a> We have already seen this displayed in John's baptism, to which Christ thus came as a witness that it did not concern him, but that He fulfilled righteousness in coming to it.<a name=29:2></a> This gives its full character to this position.<a name=29:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence there are three characters of suffering -- for righteousness, from man -- chastening where every human sorrow can find its place as an instrument, and when faithful zeal for God therefore brings the Remnant into the sense of the condition of Israel, makes the sin and sorrow sensible -- and thirdly, suffering for sin -- atonement -- in which the human malice had so far a place that it was complete -- having no resource but in God, which brought up the soul to the consciousness that it was forsaken, then the just wrath of God against sin as such having to be borne; but here Christ was alone, and got outwardly into this loneliness, because none could pursue the path of faithfulness, in sorrow, up to the point where this was met.<a name=29:4></a> "They all forsook him and fled" -- He "looked for some to take pity, but there were none"; it was denial, or betrayal if it went further.<a name=29:5></a> Thus these two characters of suffering run into one another, as wrath against sin -- governmental, or other, is always against sin -- but they are essentially, and completely, and most importantly distinct.<a name=29:6></a> Substitution comes in here, not sympathy, and suffering with, in grace, but suffering for.<a name=29:7></a> The latter is solely divine work.<a name=29:8></a> In the former we can have part, and, on the other hand, suffering under it for our good.<a name=29:9></a> This Psalm does not rise up into atonement, but into the circumstances of it.<a name=29:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Indeed this is one of those Psalms which show how impossible it is to separate the Jewish Remnant of the latter day and Christ Himself, and how, besides atonement, He has given a ground for hope to them in their sorrows, by passing through and out of them (though for us, this is more by death in His case) yet out of them, being "heard in that he feared".<a name=29:11></a>

		First in verse 26 we read, "They persecute him whom thou hast smitten, and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded".<a name=29:12></a> Next, "God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah", so that it looks directly to the deliverance of the latter days.<a name=29:13></a> Yet it speaks of the death of Christ, as is

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But His cry was in the "acceptable time" -- His adversaries are all before God -- He looks to Him not to hide His face.<a name=30:10></a> The adding of "Those whom thou hast wounded", makes it evident that it is not divine wrath, as borne vicariously, but the sorrows which Israel will bear, viewed as faithful and yet under the rod.<a name=30:11></a> It is chapter 50, not 53, of Isaiah.<a name=30:12></a> He interprets what He suffers from man as the rod of God, and so as to Israel it was.<a name=30:13></a> So, according to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#94:12">Psalm  94:12</a>, 13, when the hour of Satan's power came, the Lord entered into this.<a name=30:14></a> He must take His place here.<a name=30:15></a> It was the cup His Father was giving Him to drink -- He takes it from none -- He takes all this smiting of people, and enemies, as Jehovah's.<a name=30:16></a> He was taking this place for the sins of Israel, and they exult over Him.<a name=30:17></a> It is not the cup, but He has taken the place of drinking it, and they rejoice to profit by His bowing His head to it (they seeing but the outside -- that He was no longer preserved) to heap every injury upon Him.<a name=30:18></a> This is what the Lord feels in this Psalm.<a name=30:19></a> But this is entirely a different thing from divine wrath against sin -- <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#94">Psalm  94</a>could not apply to that, and say "Blessed".<a name=30:20></a> Hence, as we have seen elsewhere, He looks for judgment as the consequence of it.<a name=30:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It has been remarked to me, and I believe it is true, that there is never in the Psalms any sentiment such as is expressed in the Lord's words, "Father, forgive them, for they know

	<div class="paragraph">
		The second point, and Psalm, is the Anointed and the decree -- authoritative purpose of Jehovah; and here the kings rise up as well as Jewish rulers -- take counsel against Jehovah and His Anointed.<a name=36:16></a> The pride of pretension in power, and the plotting of their rulers to cast off their restraint -- but this is not simply moral government, but the decree of God setting up His King in Zion -- His Son, owned as begotten in time, and this is made good by His executing judgment.<a name=36:17></a> They are called to serve Jehovah, and kiss, or do homage to the Son.<a name=36:18></a> Both suppose the sure result of divine judgment, but both suppose the prevalence of evil, and (the latter) opposition to Christ's authority when revealed.<a name=36:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The two first Psalms are, as it were, introductory -- <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#1">Psalm  1</a>of the great general truths, <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>of the circumstances in which, according to the ordained glory of Christ, they are brought out to light.<a name=44:2></a> Yet Christ in the midst of the Jews is, in the first, the matter of it.<a name=44:3></a> The first is His characteristics, the second is His power as set by the Father, King; and so the circumstances of the Psalms suitably.<a name=44:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The two first Psalms give thus very distinctly the great points of the whole Book.<a name=44:5></a> The godly man, and the title of Christ, but the former along with ungodliness, and the latter resisted, and then, in the rest, the consequences of power not being put forth to secure their position.<a name=44:6></a> Hence the sorrows and heart exercise of the godly meek in the midst of the evil, looking to the Lord and the ruin of the throne, though less frequent, and from time to time the position of Christ Himself, who must have entered into the sorrow and made atonement too, in order that there might be either hope or deliverance, but not the knowledge of it before deliverance.<a name=44:7></a> The Spirit of Christ enters into it all though, as leading the exercises of the godly -- the Spring of them; but then in a Jewish way, looking for the destruction of enemies for deliverance, and the hope founded on the Spirit's work, leading to promises and assured blessings to Israel, for which Jehovah was trusted, though all seemed against -- not a known atonement giving peace with God in heaven, as risen, in the sanctuary.<a name=44:8></a> Atonement must be the basis of blessing, but besides that, there is position, ours is in Christ in heavenly places; Christ's on earth was the perfect pattern of theirs.<a name=44:9></a> Only this involved material differences, as known union by the Holy Ghost.<a name=44:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To the end of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8">Psalm  8</a>it gives an idea of this; the five following (i.<a name=44:11></a>e.<a name=44:12></a>, <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#3">Psalm  3</a>to 7) giving the moral condition of the Remnant, power not having yet come in; and <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8">Psalm  8</a>giving the larger extent of Son of Man glory, consequent on Messiah's rejection -- these, and also the election of Zion, which is material in the historical course of dealings, for Zion is the holy hill.<a name=44:13></a> Hence David so importantly brings out all the course of them; he was the godly man and rejected king, though anointed in the midst of the ungodly, and in a certain sense, subdued the heathen, when delivered from the strivings of the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is clear that the first Psalm brings in an entirely new element into the Jewish question, namely the distinction of the godly man within the people, and that distinction made good in the judgment, in contrast with the national government as a whole.<a name=45:3></a> Note also the beginning of <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#49">Isaiah  49</a>, and the already noted use of "servant" there.<a name=45:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first and second Psalms we have nothing of the Son of David.<a name=45:5></a> No doubt David was anointed and Solomon his son, but Christ is not prophetically presented, in this leading introductory part, as the Son of God, and this, in a measure Nathanael's, and fully Peter's confession.<a name=45:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This throws great light on what passed in the Gospels.<a name=45:7></a> The Son of Man of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8">Psalm  8</a>is added there, but, though He were Son of David, that is not the subject brought forward in the Gospel, at any rate till the blind man of Jericho.<a name=45:8></a> You have in Luke, where He is specially Son of Man in grace, the Jewish character in full, and exclusively for them, as they thus were in the two first chapters -- as the song of the Angels, Son of David according to the flesh, and according to promise.<a name=45:9></a> But the general history of all the Gospels is what He personally was -- the Son of God according to the Spirit of holiness, to be discerned by faith.<a name=45:10></a> And personally coming according to the Word, and fulfilling these Psalms, Christ was necessarily this -- the expression of it even when it did not, as in John, go farther.<a name=45:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Note, the first two Psalms are God's mind and consequently the result "the end of the Lord"; <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#3">Psalm  3</a>, etc.<a name=45:12></a>, is the experience of the godly man.<a name=45:13></a> These two introductory Psalms are of the greatest importance in this respect.<a name=45:14></a> And note, in these Psalms there is no experience nor sentiment of any kind; they hold a distinct place of revelation and exhortation -- an introduction quite distinct from what follows.<a name=45:15></a> The Holy Ghost Himself tells us what the mind of the Lord is.<a name=45:16></a> Nor, in any case, is there a Psalm of the Son of David, not even <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#72">Psalm  72</a>, that is prophetic of his time; we find the same elsewhere as in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#145">Psalm  145</a>, but not the experience of the time expressed by one in it.<a name=45:17></a>

		We first get the great general effect of God's government when the two, godly and ungodly, are in the earth, and that of course among Jews -- His delight is in the law of Jehovah.<a name=45:18></a> The ungodly are not so, but when looked at (as applied in

		fact) it contemplates the judgment, i.<a name=46:1></a>e.<a name=46:2></a>, the close there is a judgment on the earth -- they cannot stand in it; there will be, in result, a congregation of the righteous -- they are not found there.<a name=46:3></a> In a word, in application it is the closing history of God's dealings with the Jews.<a name=46:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The principles of God's government are first stated, but they are never made good as against the wicked till judgment be executed; hence the application to the latter days.<a name=46:5></a> The second Psalm brings this out more fully, because the Christ, the Anointed is brought in.<a name=46:6></a> Here all is definitely at the close and the kings of the earth and the rulers rise up against Jehovah, and against His Anointed, to hinder His exercising His authority on the earth; but, as in heaven, He mocks their efforts, and He will speak to them in His wrath, and vex them in His sore displeasure.<a name=46:7></a> In spite of this raging He sets His King in Zion.<a name=46:8></a> It is not merely a judgment of right and wrong, godly and ungodly, but the establishing the authority of a Person in Zion.<a name=46:9></a> But the Psalm then goes back to Christ's birth upon the earth -- He is the begotten Son there of Jehovah, who makes the decree -- not only will He sit in Zion King, but the heathen are called upon to submit, for He is about, as placed there, to smite the kings of the earth, and take in possession its uttermost parts.<a name=46:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus in fact these two Psalms place us, at the close, in presence of the judgment.<a name=46:11></a> This is of all importance in understanding the Psalms; we are with the godly Remnant in the latter day, owning the law first of all -- then in presence of the purpose of God to put Him, who has been born His Son on the earth, in possession of Messiah's place and Messiah's power and rights.<a name=46:12></a> It explains, too, much in the Gospels, and especially in Matthew, "Till the Son of Man come", says the Lord, yet He was there -- "Elias cometh", but in spirit he had been there.<a name=46:13></a> Christ had entered into the position and sorrow of the godly Remnant, and made that atonement too which enables the Remnant to go through the sorrow and be accepted, though it is only at the close of it they learn its value.<a name=46:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are only two subjects objectively put before us -- the godly man under the government of God, the ungodly being rejected -- and the establishment of the Anointed in power in Zion in spite of and over all.<a name=46:15></a> If Messiah takes a part in grace with the godly, and that <i>de facto</i> they go through the trial, that is a matter of experience -- the revealed place is favour to
	</div>

		godliness, and final full victory.<a name=47:1></a> Christ is in the world -- the begotten Son of God.<a name=47:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The heavenly position of Christ is not the subject here, but Jehovah and the Anointed, and His being set King in Zion.<a name=47:3></a> But I cannot doubt that verses 4 and 5 present us Christ Himself in heaven; verses 6 and 7 declare, as a new matter, Jehovah's purpose, and the human birth of Christ upon earth, but as characterising the Anointed set as King in Zion.<a name=47:4></a> But this Son is Jehovah in whom men have to trust -- and there is a curse on those who trust in mere man; the Son will be angry, and execute the wrath of verse 5.<a name=47:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence the subject of the Psalms is the latter days, but, in as much as "in all their afflictions he was afflicted", and in the latter days He is coming from heaven in wrath, He has come and entered into all their sorrows as born of God in the earth, as "this day begotten" -- as Son, but learning obedience by the things which He suffered; but this from man, compare <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#50">Isaiah  50</a>.<a name=47:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Although directly applicable doubtless to David, <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#3">Psalm  3</a>and 4 seem to me to be more directly applicable to Christ.<a name=47:7></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#5">Psalm  5</a>and 6 more directly to the Remnant, even as to these they are deprecatory, chastening in displeasure.<a name=47:8></a> It is only in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#25">Psalm  25</a>that sins are acknowledged.<a name=47:9></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16">Psalm  16</a>Christ formally takes His place with the godly Remnant.<a name=47:10></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#3">Psalm  3</a>and 4, viewed as applicable to Messiah, they are in the full consciousness of His glory and title.<a name=47:11></a> The godly man is set apart for Jehovah.<a name=47:12></a> These two Psalms are surely the state of the people in the latter day, but Messiah enters into it in Spirit so as to associate His title and confidence with them, just as David might for Israel, compare <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#3:8">Psalm  3:8</a>.<a name=47:13></a> They cannot be separated from Him, nor will He from them.<a name=47:14></a> The body of the people are against the godly man -- but he is set apart for God.<a name=47:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#3">Psalm  3</a>, verse 7, Messiah and the godly are all looked at as having a common interest, the ungodly being busy and in power -- Messiah in title of power, but the ungodly as yet rejecting His title, and the Remnant oppressed and suffering.<a name=47:16></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8">Psalm  8</a>He is recognised as Son of Man, and gone up on high and set over all things.<a name=47:17></a> This is quite a new place and character of Christ, not in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#1">Psalm  1</a>and 2, nor in any previous Psalms.<a name=47:18></a> So we find it brought out in the Gospels.<a name=47:19></a>

		@PSALM 54
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This Psalm is Christ as the object of God's deliverance or saving power, including its desire and acknowledgment -- both important as showing the position of Christ.<a name=129:4></a> It takes Him, in His whole position as a Jew, from His first trial to the deliverance of the Jews in that day.<a name=129:5></a> The Name is the manifestation of the internal and essential power, and character, precisely what is obscured and refused in this world of confusion and evil.<a name=129:6></a> The judging is just the intervention of that Name in power, so as to vindicate the consistency of Christ with it -- the thread of order, of which Christ was the witness, and which was attached to His name in the midst of evil, because He was it, and therefore the vindication of it was the vindication of God's name; and so the saving by His name was peculiarly appropriate, for indeed it was the declaration of the identity of that Name in God with Christ, as in the world, for He had that Name in weakness.<a name=129:7></a> Therefore He says, "Judge me by thy strength", i.<a name=129:8></a>e.<a name=129:9></a>, "Vindicate, as to me in weakness, that character and name which is thine in strength, by the putting forth of thy strength, as vindicating itself".<a name=129:10></a> Now this is true as regards man, by its conformity, and as regards the object even, on account of its very weakness, because graciousness of love, and faithfulness of kindness is part of the very Name to be revealed.<a name=129:11></a> This cannot be pursued further here.<a name=129:12></a> "Thou hast loved", etc.<a name=129:13></a> is part of it -- "O righteous Father" is again another -- and "My God, my God", etc.<a name=129:14></a>, and "Therefore doth my Father"; so "Not unto us", etc.<a name=129:15></a>, and even "Be merciful unto my sin, for it is great", proceeds on the same principle.<a name=129:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is a subject full of interest, because the Church can always go on this ground of unfailing righteousness, and say "Not unto us".<a name=129:17></a> The Church is in the character of God, and in this weakness therefore it cries, and therefore it cries for the vindication of this character.<a name=129:18></a> So Christ was enabled to say "I know that thou hearest me always", but therefore also "Judgment must begin at the house of God".<a name=129:19></a> Thus Christ

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It seems to me that this Psalm also would seem to make Christ speak in the language of mediatorial praise, as well as affliction; and observe the reason.<a name=130:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this Psalm it is, unusually, the name of God, and the strength of God which is appealed to, but, as we have seen, before God is proved (an only refuge actually for the position in which Christ sees things) in contrast with all men, it puts the relationship in which the Spirit of Christ finds itself consequent upon the truth of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#53">Psalm  53</a>.<a name=130:8></a> They are strangers -- God is not before them -- God is His helper.<a name=130:9></a> It was not now a matter of covenant, for all this was forsaken, but abstract faith in God.<a name=130:10></a> But this faith produces -- sense, and application of covenant.<a name=130:11></a> Christ is alone in "Me" (verse 2), but "Jehovah is with them that uphold my soul".<a name=130:12></a> The sense of favour, on God's principles towards others, is the restoration of one's own soul in righteousness; not "with me", for He was as an outcast for our sake, because perfect, His trust in God as the one only perfect Man, but this induced and became the object of all concentrating grace afterwards.<a name=130:13></a> Therefore it is Jehovah, and all the trouble in result is passed -- the moral history of all that shall arrive in that day.<a name=130:14></a>

		As to the names of God, we find <i>Jah</i>, <i>Jehovah</i>, <i>Eh'yeh</i>.<a name=151:1></a> I do not know how far I am justified as to the difference, for they are from the same root.<a name=151:2></a> In <i>Jah</i> we have the name in itself -- simply, "He who exists".<a name=151:3></a> <i>Eh'yeh</i> is the expression of it by Himself.<a name=151:4></a> So "I" comes in -- there is the conscious will of existence, which, in a divine Being, goes with the existence in itself.<a name=151:5></a> In <i>Jehovah</i>, <i>Jah</i> is developed into "Is, was, and is to come" -- the Securer of promise, in which we have continued existence, time coming into account -- continuity present, past and future.<a name=151:6></a>

		This Psalm has led me to look at these names of God, as God.<a name=151:7></a> <i>Jah</i> seems to be the existing One objectively.<a name=151:8></a> There is One, and only One who is -- <i>Eh'yeh</i> is His own assertion of it -- conscious existence in will.<a name=151:9></a> <i>Jehovah</i>, He who does so exist, but is in relation with others, and revealed in time.<a name=151:10></a> He always is, but "was and is to come" is brought in.<a name=151:11></a> There is existence, but not only an eternal "now", but a past, and what is to come.<a name=151:12></a> He is in relationship, and in connection with time, and so a Securer of promises.<a name=151:13></a> And we read of His mercy enduring "for ever".<a name=151:14></a> But then another name comes in, which is related to none of these -- <i>Adonai</i>, which carries the thought on the face of it of lordship and rule.<a name=151:15></a> It is a relation of another kind, not connected with His Being and Existence, but of office and position, flowing indeed from a necessary and essential title, but which necessitates other existences, and a state of things -- an office that may be taken or given.<a name=151:16></a> The root of the word is simple -- "<i>Adon</i>", is "lord" or "master".<a name=151:17></a> Abraham was Sarah's "lord", and Eliezer's "master".<a name=151:18></a> But there is more than this when it is used of God -- it takes the form of the plural, of majesty so called.<a name=151:19></a> How used, we will look into a little.<a name=151:20></a>

		<i>Adonai Jehovah</i> is a constant expression; in the Authorised Version usually "Lord God", which also represents <i>Jehovah Elohim</i> -- only Lord.<a name=151:21></a> But <i>Adonai</i> is used where it is <i>Jehovah</i>, as in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#6:1">Isaiah  6:1</a>; "I saw the Lord" (<i>Adonai</i>) "high and lifted up", etc.<a name=151:22></a>, and at the end, "Woe is me .<a name=151:23></a>.<a name=151:24></a>.<a name=151:25></a> for I have seen the King, the Lord of hosts" (<i>Jehovah Sabaoth</i>).<a name=151:26></a> So the Seraphim in verse 5; yet <i>Adonai</i> suits.<a name=151:27></a> Thus <i>Adonai</i> is identified with <i>Jehovah</i>.<a name=151:28></a> This is quite clear and simple.<a name=151:29></a> But it is of this passage <a href="../bible/John.htm#12">John  12</a>speaks, that the prophet saw Christ's glory, and spake of Him.<a name=151:30></a> It is <i>Adonai</i>, but it is <i>Jehovah</i>.<a name=151:31></a>

		We must remark that <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#116">Psalm  116</a>is a Psalm of thanksgiving, and, on the principle recognised above, He does not love the Lord as under the law, but as first loved as for deliverance, because heard when judgment and evil was upon His soul.<a name=220:1></a> Christ leads this thanksgiving or return of heart to Jehovah, saying (verse 5), "Our God is merciful".<a name=220:2></a> It is the thanksgiving song for deliverance producing love, and love and voice of praise and thanksgiving in remembrance of their estate.<a name=220:3></a> The vows are now to be paid, and they can be paid "in the midst of Jerusalem", for the deliverance is wrought; compare <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#42">Psalm  42</a>, 43, 44, and the Psalms there.<a name=220:4></a> There they are under the sorrow -- here, the Spirit of Christ puts itself in the place of deliverance; there it was the people, "We have heard", and Christ the object as King -- here He Himself leads, as a matter too of individual joy to His people, "I love Jehovah".<a name=220:5></a> This makes the position quite different -- more near, and a matter of affection and intimacy, because of what was wrought, and Christ intimate with Jehovah in union, but as helped, and the people having put Himself in their place, His hand laid on both.<a name=220:6></a> This makes <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#116">Psalm  116</a>more blessed.<a name=220:7></a> It is His own Spirit rejoicing in the deliverance as One of the people, and so saying "Our God".<a name=220:8></a>

		Paul quotes both these Psalms in Corinthians and in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>.<a name=220:9></a> There is an analogous exercise of the Spirit in us -- we may look at Christ as taking us as united to Himself, and so presenting us before God, and there in the highest perfection and place before Him, and also as in us, looking up towards Him and saying, "We".<a name=220:10></a> The Spirit realises our union, and then all is liberty and joy, because for us accomplished.<a name=220:11></a> The Spirit realises our position, and looks up to Him alone there, saying, "We".<a name=220:12></a> And here is the difference of the Remnant then and now, or in apostolic days; when we speak of union, we speak of glory and perfection and rest, whereas in the suffering we are substitutes for Christ in the world, though it be only by union we can go through, and we say, "As it is written, I believed and therefore I spake" -- we also -- and therefore adds positive resurrection <i>de facto</i>, as to his direct testimony, whereas He says "I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living", and the bonds are loosed -- the power is shown in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#1">2 Corinthians  1</a>; whereas, the suffering being before them as their portion before they find Christ, He comes down as it were, and enters into them, and says "I".<a name=220:13></a> And thus, while there is

		This is altogether a Jewish Psalm, and is the assertion, as it seems to me, of the continuance of our Lord in His Jewish character upon His resurrection; but it goes farther and accredits the continuance of the Name of Jehovah of which the Jewish economy was but the dispensed instrument of revelation -- as we in Jesus of Father.<a name=221:4></a> Hence note also the very important principle that these dispensations upon earth are for the purpose, though blessing in them, of developing and revealing those characters and fulness of God which is the continuous object of perpetual worship and adoration to those so knowing them.<a name=221:5></a> God has been so revealed now -- the Lord as God-Man, both reveals God in these characters and acts alone in the perfection of His Manhood towards them, nor do I see (though exalted in the faithfulness of God) but this is the perpetual condition of His Manhood, i.<a name=221:6></a>e.<a name=221:7></a>, not that there should be Jews for ever, but that the glory of that character of God, so known in them, should continue for ever.<a name=221:8></a> In this sense it is I connect "the Son" to be "subject for ever".<a name=221:9></a> Now this is all rehearsed in the millennium, so to speak, the Jews holding the place of the earthly son or servant, as taking the official, respective place, towards God, of the children of men, and Christ the Son of man at the head of them.<a name=221:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus this Psalm, I believe, speaks, including or looking on to as involving the principle of the other, but excluding the heavenlies.<a name=221:11></a> It is the assertion of Jesus in resurrection, "I still love Jehovah" -- I am still in this position, not forgetting what Jehovah was to me in the day of my humiliation -- and thus righteously owning and magnifying the righteousness therein exhibited, for God, Jehovah, does nothing to be lost, yea, not even in its fragments.<a name=221:12></a> We are of course speaking here solely of the manhood of our Lord -- though fully recognised, it is seldom dwelt upon in the Psalms as being more particularly His connection with the Jews, which of course through their Jehovah (see <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#50">Isaiah  50</a>) was in His manhood, or human fellowship and nature.<a name=221:13></a> This then is the perfect position of Jesus toward Jehovah -- His full trial, and perfectness in it, and perfectness shown, as else it would not be, in it, and Himself

		This exceedingly beautiful and well-known Psalm appears to me to be this -- other Psalms testify of the circumstances surrounding the Remnant, as having the Spirit of Christ -- this of their state, i.<a name=227:6></a>e.<a name=227:7></a>, the Spirit of Christ in them expressing that state, the law written in their hearts, judgments being executed, so that there is what shows the Lord's interference, so that the sense of this is expressed; but, not yet delivered finally from the oppressor, their estimate of their whole condition under and as connected with their circumstances -- the mind of the Spirit of Christ in them.<a name=227:8></a> It is most interesting in this point of view -- all the holy yet humble thoughts and feelings of this poor people, expressed in the now returning righteous confidence of their delight in God, breaking forth to God who has put His law in their hearts when He is interfering for their deliverance.<a name=227:9></a>

		The law written on the heart supposes a new nature no doubt, but it is delight in that in which God morally delights, with reference to Him as willing it, but not simply in nature or capacity of nature, but as He has revealed it -- in obedience as commandment, delight as statutes and ordinances, heart-approbation as judgments, intelligence by the revealed Word in all as good in itself, but good as God's will, and referred to God as His delight in His nature, but a link with God because the heart delights in it, and in it as His expressed mind and will.<a name=228:7></a> It is a moral delight within the circle of circumstances, i.<a name=228:8></a>e.<a name=228:9></a>, not within their reach -- littleness allows of it -- scorn does not hinder it -- princes may sit and speak against it.<a name=228:10></a> This does not change moral delight, and the thought of God makes others' disapproval simply nothing.<a name=228:11></a> It is blessing to the heart, cleanses, is the heart's delight as of God, guides, is sought when the heart is broken.<a name=228:12></a> He who thus relies, leans on, the truth of God's revealed will, according to His moral nature, can count on it for result.<a name=228:13></a>

		The Spirit then calls the remembrance of Jehovah, to David and all His afflictions -- the type and memorial of a greater Sufferer.<a name=243:8></a> This, in each class of the Psalms, is introduced, and David forms the root and centre of Israelitish hopes in grace, through Him who was the Root and Offspring of David, and that on the full apostasy of Israel as to its own ways and God's dealings.<a name=243:9></a> The ark, pledge of the covenant, the pledge of God's rest, was heard of at Ephratah, and found in the fields of the wood.<a name=243:10></a> Possibly there is allusion here to Christ's birthplace, or when David was little and despised there, as the Root of David was.<a name=243:11></a> His heart was secretly on the ark of the covenant of His God, which was cast away by the apostasy of His people (for David was the type of grace after apostasy) and He could have no rest until a habitation for it (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#15">Exodus  15</a>) was found.<a name=243:12></a> Hence, i.<a name=243:13></a>e.<a name=243:14></a>, from this identification with God's glory in the midst of apostasy, all His afflictions.<a name=243:15></a> It was not now, as in Israel's journeyings, "Rise Lord and let thine enemies", etc.<a name=243:16></a>, and "Return O Lord to the many thousands of Israel", but "Arise into thy rest" -- His rest, which grace had recovered in the midst of apostasy, where worship and service was to be.<a name=243:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I add some further words on this Psalm.<a name=245:12></a> First of all, David's sufferings are the basis of all, i.<a name=245:13></a>e.<a name=245:14></a>, Christ.<a name=245:15></a> Next it is sovereign grace; for responsibility even, under the mercy declared through Moses, was closed when the ark was taken captive by the Philistines -- there could be no day of atonement, no blood on the mercy-seat.<a name=245:16></a> Ichabod was written on all -- God had "delivered his strength into captivity, his glory into the enemy's hands".<a name=245:17></a> Sovereign grace raised up Samuel the prophet, and then David, who brought the ark, not into the tabernacle at all, but to Mount Zion, which was thus the seat of sovereign grace in power, in contrast with Sinai.<a name=245:18></a> God is called on to "arise into his rest", for He will rest in His love.<a name=245:19></a> It is His rest we are to enter into -- where His love will be satisfied and His nature perfectly met through the fruits of it, as in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:4">Ephesians  4:4</a>, 5.<a name=245:20></a> Christ "will see of the travail of his soul and be satisfied".<a name=245:21></a> Hence it is God's rest and of the ark of His strength -- a new thing; not "Let God arise and his enemies be scattered" and "Return O Lord to the ten thousands of Israel".<a name=245:22></a>

		But the desire is, rightly according to man, the answer according to God -- the desire right and according to God's nature and ways, but the blessing according to the riches of grace.<a name=246:6></a> The desire is that Jehovah should arise and enter into His rest, and the ark of His strength, for the strength and faithful covenant-working of God enters into rest when all is accomplished.<a name=246:7></a> The answer is "This is my rest for ever .<a name=246:8></a>.<a name=246:9></a>.<a name=246:10></a> .<a name=246:11></a> The Lord hath chosen Zion".<a name=246:12></a> It is His desire, and He will therefore dwell there.<a name=246:13></a> It is more than asked; but it is more, the heart led of God has been brought to desire what is God's desire and the object of His election.<a name=246:14></a> So the desire is righteousness for the priests -- as John Baptist's father.<a name=246:15></a> The answer is, "They shall be clothed with salvation", the full, final deliverance of God.<a name=246:16></a> The desire is right -- righteousness becomes them -- the answer is from God, and becomes Him in the power of His grace.<a name=246:17></a> The desire is that the "saints may shout for joy" -- all right; the renewed heart must desire the prosperity and joy of God's chosen, and God will give it abundantly, "They shall shout aloud for joy".<a name=246:18></a>

		There are two parts in this Psalm -- the prayer and the answer, down to verse 10; from verse 11 to the end, it is Christ under the character and in connection with David -- David and his afflictions -- seeking a resting-place for the tabernacle of Jehovah, "A habitation for the mighty One of Jacob", finding no rest till He had a habitation; compare <a href="../bible/Haggai.htm#1:4">Haggai  1:4</a>, and the literal David, <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#7:2">2 Samuel  7:2</a>.<a name=247:11></a> But the truth is, though there is a rest for the ark of God, the ark of God's strength, yet the Lord builds David's house in a higher sense.<a name=247:12></a> It was wandering as lost, heard of at Ephratah, and found in the fields of the wood -- neglected and despised of men, not "we will worship at his footstool".<a name=247:13></a>

		Now in the Psalms, whatever their knowledge of Christ, they are Jews, and look for the deliverance of Jehovah.<a name=280:3></a> It is confidence in Jehovah as, after all, not forgetting His people; and Christ was the proof -- "This poor man cried and was delivered out of all his distress".<a name=280:4></a> He may have died as others who hoped a better resurrection, as Abraham offered Isaac, but "Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him".<a name=280:5></a> What Christ had passed through warranted the faithful in trusting in Jehovah as Jehovah.<a name=280:6></a> But then the 144,000, though doubtless trusting in the Lord, were in neither of the cases properly, i.<a name=280:7></a>e.<a name=280:8></a>, neither in mere earthly nor the full heavenly blessing.<a name=280:9></a> The song is sung not by those who were around the throne (<i>en kuklo tou thronou</i>) nor on earth; it is sung "before the throne".<a name=280:10></a> It is not yet the King on Mount Zion, and the glory of the Lord filling, or now to fill the earth -- they are bought from the earth, as first-fruits.<a name=280:11></a> They are connected with the Lamb, but not with the Lamb on the Throne, no more than with the King set on Zion, and owned with the Lamb on Mount Zion.<a name=280:12></a> It was, as it were, between the two.<a name=280:13></a> The song is for them alone to learn.<a name=280:14></a> Further, they are first-fruits to God and the Lamb, i.<a name=280:15></a>e.<a name=280:16></a>, from the earth, and they had not their Father's name but His on their foreheads; as to us, He is gone to His Father and our Father, His God and our God.<a name=280:17></a> It is not here union spoken of exactly, but concomitancy, companionship.<a name=280:18></a> I suppose they have owned Him as the Son of God, like Nathaniel, but had not received, themselves, the Holy Ghost as the Spirit of adoption and unity.<a name=280:19></a> It is evident they have owned Christ, before He appears as Son of Man crowned; they are identified with the Lamb, but, as we have seen, on Mount Zion.<a name=280:20></a> This difference of the Psalms is of the last importance.<a name=280:21></a> It goes in testimony even to the recognition of the Son, but never at all into the place of the Church, and here a reading, too, of the first chapter of the Apocalypse is important -- "The testimony of Jesus, what he saw", not "and what He saw".<a name=280:22></a> Thus "the Spirit of prophecy is the testimony of Jesus".<a name=280:23></a>

		Further, in the ministry of Peter, and the Church at Jerusalem, have we not the proof that the heavenly power of Christ may descend to the ministration of the kingdom of heaven upon earth (Christ's return is proposed to the Jews) as was the case up to Stephen's death?<a name=281:5></a> the identity of the Church with Christ in heaven not being yet the subject of ministry.<a name=281:6></a> I have sometimes thought that perhaps the 144,000 on Mount Zion might be raised, though not in the heavenly condition; this would not touch the heavenly hope of sufferers under the beast -- they are redeemed from the earth, the condition of Christ during the forty days.<a name=281:7></a> For this purpose the special place of the ark on Mount Zion, <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#16">1 Chronicles  16</a>must be studied, when the tabernacle and service were at Gibeon; and then, note particularly, the Psalms there connected.<a name=281:8></a> Israel, the end of His demands, mindful of His covenant and promises to Abraham -- then the earth summoned according to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#96">Psalm  96</a>, and note the place we have seen that in.<a name=281:9></a> The Lord was not yet between the cherubim.<a name=281:10></a> Then the <i>olam chasido</i> (His mercy for ever) and the prayer for the bringing back of all the scattered; and that is what Christ will do after He appears in glory, see <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#24">Matthew  24</a>, according to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#106">Psalm  106</a>, and then the closing blessing.<a name=281:11></a> But this must be studied; and note the phrase at the end of chapter.<a name=281:12></a>

		It is evident to me that <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#24">Matthew  24</a>is properly what happens at the end in Judea -- the beginning of sorrows and the great tribulation consequent on the abomination of desolation.<a name=281:13></a> There may have been analogous circumstances after the Lord's death, and I doubt not were, which in effect began the sorrows of the Jewish people, but the regular continuous history is at the latter day.<a name=281:14></a> I also see that <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#21">Luke  21</a>, on the other hand, gives the general account of what would historically arrive to them as a people.<a name=281:15></a>

		In Numbers, we have the typical facts and circumstances -- all that in the journeys of the children of Israel was morally profitable to the Church, or children of God generally, and developed the dispensation, as the red heifer, Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, Moses faithful in all God's house -- in a word, all those things which "happened unto them for ensamples, and are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come".<a name=300:5></a> Accordingly I believe it will be found most of the things so used by the Apostles in warning, and the cautions and exhortations of faith as to the Church, in this wilderness scene, are much taken from this Book.<a name=300:6></a> In this point of view, the consideration of Reuben's, Gad's and Manasseh's land on this side Jordan will be interesting.<a name=300:7></a>

		In Deuteronomy, Moses in reciting the destruction of the Tables and what followed, recounts that Jehovah, in desiring him to come up and receive the Law on the two Tables which he was to make, tells him to make an ark for them, the former are thus supposed presented without ark before the people, but it having been demonstrated that they were incapable of the Law, it is shut up in Christ -- afterwards written on their hearts.<a name=302:13></a> This gives a very remarkable contrast of the place of the Law after failure, or man being a sinner; before, Moses carries them down to Israel and breaks them in the presence of Israel before their eyes -- now it is provided, in giving it, that it should be shut up in the ark of the covenant, as in fact it is in Christ, though afterwards it may be written in the heart when He owns the people.<a name=302:14></a> This analogical testimony, if it be justly understood, is of very great force.<a name=302:15></a>
