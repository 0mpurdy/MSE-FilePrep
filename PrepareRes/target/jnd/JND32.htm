		GOD IN HIS ESSENCE AND ATTRIBUTES
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What is fundamental in speaking of attributes, is inherent in the very term itself.<a name=1:1></a> It is not the being in its essential nature, even though always found there, but what is rightly attributed to the being as such; and in speaking of God this is not without importance; and the difference will be found very simple.<a name=1:2></a> Attributes are relative; hence God, who is absolute, cannot be spoken of as being the attribute itself.<a name=1:3></a> It is only a character which belongs to Him.<a name=1:4></a> God is something in Himself.<a name=1:5></a> But He is also something in relationship to other things when they exist or are supposed to exist.<a name=1:6></a> The attributes may be a necessary consequence of what He is, and I suppose in God always are, but they are not what He is Himself.<a name=1:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Further, no attribute can be rightly appropriated to God, which removes Him from His place as God, in necessary and absolute supremacy.<a name=1:8></a> The Being to whom I attribute it is gone if I do so.<a name=1:9></a> God cannot be the object of judgment, or He has wholly lost His place as God; yea, he who judges sets himself up in His place, and puts God in subjection to him.<a name=1:10></a> Evidently He is thus no longer God.<a name=1:11></a> Cicero says in the <i>de Officiis</i>, "Quasi material .<a name=1:12></a>.<a name=1:13></a>.<a name=1:14></a> subjecta est veritas.<a name=1:15></a>" Now this evidently God can never be, for my mind is here supreme, and God subject to it.<a name=1:16></a> This is at once the pride and the folly of man.<a name=1:17></a> This is what modern Rationalism (and I suppose the mind of man has always so acted) calls the supremacy of conscience, by which revelation and everything else is judged of.<a name=1:18></a> But if conscience, as my action and judgment, is supreme, there is no God at all.<a name=1:19></a> A God who is not alone supreme, is no God.<a name=1:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Has man, then, no thought of God at all?<a name=1:21></a> Not so.<a name=1:22></a> He cannot judge by his mind, but he has the knowledge of good and evil -- conscience.<a name=1:23></a> It may be corrupted, perverted, hardened, but he makes the difference of right and wrong.<a name=1:24></a> Scripture shews us he got this by the fall, and so as under sin.<a name=1:25></a> Still it brings in God, saying "The man is become as one of us, knowing good and evil.<a name=1:26></a>" It is not a law, a rule from without, imposed, but what is intrinsic (in man).<a name=1:27></a> He says, That is a good thing, that a bad one; and he concludes at once, God cannot approve a wrong thing, nor condemn a good thing.<a name=1:28></a> A man may, from passions, education, habit, have a very wrong measure of right and wrong; and demon-gods may make him put evil for good, and good for evil; but he makes the difference, and the sense of right or wrong in itself leads him to attribute right to God, and not wrong.<a name=1:29></a> "Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?<a name=1:30></a>"

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But this right and wrong is connected with obligation, and is measured by relationships.<a name=2:1></a> I owe to a father, a husband, my neighbour, what belongs to that relationship: so to God.<a name=2:2></a> That is, the unperverted sense of right and wrong puts God in His place, does not judge Him.<a name=2:3></a> It is not an idea formed, but a relationship recognised, and hence subjection.<a name=2:4></a> Thus Adam lived in peace before the fall.<a name=2:5></a> Divine supremacy and authority was there, and owned, and then with knowledge the relationship was transgressed.<a name=2:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But supposing this sense of right and wrong in man, and that it is connected with the relationships in which we stand, I do hold that God loves righteousness and hates iniquity, because I intrinsically know right and wrong, but right and wrong being apprehended in the relationship, God is supreme to my mind; that is the first of rights.<a name=2:7></a> He is God, as much as my father is my father, and I own subjection to Him as God.<a name=2:8></a> I do say, He must be righteous, for that is the expression of acting on what is right and good in the relationships in which He has placed others, as far as consistent with supremacy and righteousness.<a name=2:9></a> But this is not supremacy of conscience, as if I were judge, and my measure of right and wrong, or my discernment of it perfect; but that I do conclude from right and wrong abstractedly to right in God, but at the same time to supremacy and perfection as the point I start from.<a name=2:10></a> One must not confound the measure of right and wrong with the sense of it.<a name=2:11></a> To speak of the supremacy of conscience, is to assume that its measure is perfect and adequate, not obligation under it.<a name=2:12></a> When I judge God or any one, I take a measure to judge by, and may misjudge from the state of my own mind.<a name=2:13></a> That is not conscience.<a name=2:14></a> Conscience with God recognises authority also over it, and supreme authority, or God is not recognised at all, and that is simply atheism.<a name=2:15></a> What these modern infidels claim -- is to make their consciences the measure of right and wrong.<a name=2:16></a> This is false and grossly pretentious, and destroys the nature of God, and right as regards Him.<a name=2:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But we have already got into the discussion of relative qualities in God.<a name=2:18></a> This is what supposes other things besides the absolute being.<a name=2:19></a> If God is righteous, though He be so, He must be so towards others; it is relative.<a name=2:20></a> There are two words applied to God, which reveal His nature -- <i>Love</i> and <i>Light</i> -- and only these two.<a name=2:21></a> They affirm what He is in nature -- not any attribute.<a name=2:22></a> Love is goodness, but in supremacy; for, in its abstract nature goodness is identified with supremacy, for it must be free.<a name=2:23></a> It is in this it is different from desire, even when it is a holy desire.<a name=2:24></a>
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Love is used, I know, in human language for desire, in the best and most amiable sense.<a name=3:1></a> But though the same word be used in the sense of an inferior to a superior, or even an equal, this is in connection with a motive -- is moved.<a name=3:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But love, as goodness itself, is blessed in itself and free in its actings, unless want or misery draw it out; but it has not a motive which characterises it by its object.<a name=3:3></a> This is always the case in desire, even when it is in no way evil, but has the character of affection.<a name=3:4></a> In ordinary desires it forms so far the character; money, power, pleasure, give their character to the man who seeks them; but though love be used as to them, it is evidently in a lower sense, and, where desires are, the desired object so far rules over us.<a name=3:5></a> Where love exists in a divinely-formed relationship, it is, or may be a just affection.<a name=3:6></a> I say, "may be," because it may run into a mere desire and be idolatry, and the relationship falsified.<a name=3:7></a> But when rightly in exercise, save as man in certain aspects represents God, it looks up, and characterises the person in the affection.<a name=3:8></a> It is conjugal, filial, and the like.<a name=3:9></a> A husband and a father in certain respects represent God in those relationships, and so far it partakes of what He is.<a name=3:10></a> But in the closest relationship where it is not this, it has the character I speak of: "Thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.<a name=3:11></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But God suffices to Himself, and goodness makes Him infinitely happy in Himself.<a name=3:12></a> For goodness is happy if it has no object, though happy in goodness when it is exercised towards one.<a name=3:13></a> Hence it is free, because it suffices for itself.<a name=3:14></a> Hence though, in certain relationships, man may be the image of God, yet as he cannot suffice to himself, and so be free and sovereign, he is not said to be love, though he is to walk in it.<a name=3:15></a> He is as to any right state subject and recipient.<a name=3:16></a> The divine nature is in the Christian, and he loves; still "we love because"!<a name=3:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But we are light in the Lord.<a name=4:1></a> The purity of nature which belongs essentially to God is made ours in the new man; as far as it acts in us it manifests everything around us in its true character.<a name=4:2></a> Christ was love in the world, and the light of the world.<a name=4:3></a> He is the measure of both for us.<a name=4:4></a> It is a blessed thing that the two essential names of God should be the expression of the new man in us; only, as we have seen, we are not said to be love.<a name=4:5></a> But that which is the nature of God characterises us, and makes us to enjoy Him, and to act according to that character here through grace.<a name=4:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These, as I have said, are not attributes.<a name=4:7></a> Attributes are ideas which we attach to God in connection with what is outside Himself, though belonging necessarily to Him as God.<a name=4:8></a> He is omnipotent, omniscient, supreme; even righteous, holy; these, though more connected with His nature, are relative terms.<a name=4:9></a> I must think of God's dealings and claims to call Him righteous.<a name=4:10></a> He judges of something when He is righteous, only it affirms He always judges right.<a name=4:11></a> To call Him holy, I must think of evil which He rejects.<a name=4:12></a> Hence He is not called righteousness and holiness, but righteous and holy.<a name=4:13></a> What He says is truth, but He is not truth.<a name=4:14></a> Truth is what is rightly affirmed of something else.<a name=4:15></a> But God is not affirmed of something else.<a name=4:16></a> We can say Christ is the Truth, because He does tell exactly what everything is -- what God is, perfect man is, and by contrast what evil man is, what the world is, who is its prince.<a name=4:17></a> Through Him all is exactly brought out in its true character.<a name=4:18></a> Hence we say, God in Himself is absolutely Love and Light -- the last expressing perfect purity (invisible in itself), and manifesting everything as it is before God, and shewing the way before us: and God is righteous, holy, omniscient, omnipotent, supreme, and the like -- all of which are relative terms -- the former moral, the latter natural attributes.<a name=4:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Righteousness is perfectness in, or consistency with the relationship in which anyone stands; evil and good being known.<a name=4:20></a> Holiness, the aspect of heart, which intrinsic purity of nature bears towards other things, according to their character.<a name=4:21></a> We may speak of things as holy when entirely set apart to God, and separated from all profane use; but properly it applies to persons expressing their abhorrence of evil and delight in that which is pure and good.<a name=4:22></a> God is holy in Himself, abhorring evil and delighting in what answers to His perfect nature.<a name=4:23></a> The creature can only be holy as separated to God in what He is in His perfectness, because its nature can have no true and perfect object but Him, and its object gives its character to a nature in a creature, and holiness is the expression of a nature, not the obligation of a relationship.<a name=4:24></a> We are holy as far as every movement of thought answers to the impress and character of God, having Him for its object.<a name=4:25></a> Anything taken up in itself, apart from Him, is necessarily independency and sin.<a name=4:26></a> So far God is set aside.<a name=4:27></a> We have no object which makes the heart right but Him.<a name=4:28></a> Although we cannot leave God out as the author of, and as giving authority to, the relations in which we stand; yet, as we are placed in certain relationships, righteousness has somewhat more extensive range, though as a sanction God must be brought in.<a name=4:29></a> But whenever a relationship owned of God exists, it is unrighteous not to act up to it: not to be faithful to obligation in it.<a name=4:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=5>[Page 5]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now God, as righteous, maintains judicially every obligation which any relationship imposes on us.<a name=5:1></a> But first and above all, relationship to Himself according to His supremacy and moral nature; this is the basis and stay of every other.<a name=5:2></a> Only Christianity has brought out a second and more perfect measure of this.<a name=5:3></a> It recognises what is due from man according to the measure of man, his obligations in the place he is in towards God and his neighbour.<a name=5:4></a> Of this the law is the perfect measure, God making allowance for ignorance of the measure.<a name=5:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But besides this, God Himself has been perfectly glorified by the blessed Lord.<a name=5:6></a> All that He is, where sin gave occasion to the full revelation of all that He is, has been glorified in Christ, and a new ground of relationship formed according to what He is, based on what Christ has wrought.<a name=5:7></a> Hence man is in the glory of God, and God's righteousness is displayed in that.<a name=5:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Judgment is based on the actual obligations founded on the relationship in which man is.<a name=5:9></a> Acceptance goes much farther, and is according to the worth of the Lord's work; we are made the righteousness of God in Him.<a name=5:10></a> But God in righteousness maintains all the relationships in which man stands according to His will.<a name=5:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is well also to distinguish between the righteousness of God in government, and the immutable character of God, according to which we must stand before Him, if in His revealed presence.<a name=5:12></a> His revealed requirement of righteousness forms, with long patience exercised on His part, through goodness, the basis of His righteous government, never to be fully revealed until Christ comes; partially displayed in Israel, where needed to maintain the recollection of it everywhere; and in a signal way in the flood which closed the old world.<a name=5:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=6>[Page 6]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But standing before God fully revealed, supposes not our obligations to Him in government exercised to maintain His authority, and the natural sense, or revealed rule of right or wrong, but fitness for His own presence.<a name=6:1></a> This is in Christ only.<a name=6:2></a> This is fully revealed in Christianity alone, and wrath from heaven in connection with it; Romans 1: 1-20.<a name=6:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When I speak of what is holy, it is not judicial authority, as in the case of righteousness, but what purity of nature abhors and rejects, or delights in.<a name=6:4></a> Righteous and holy are the attributes which attach themselves to the moral nature of God and His supreme authority.<a name=6:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is that in God, the sense of which is with difficulty lost in man, though he be without God in the world.<a name=6:6></a> This has turned the sense of a being above himself, perfect in knowledge and power, a Supreme Being, into what is the fruit of imagination or servile dread -- Mythology and Fetishism.<a name=6:7></a> The visible powers of nature were deified, because a God was wanting for the heart.<a name=6:8></a> The legends of ancient days were turned into myths of the gods.<a name=6:9></a> Terror told of a revengeful power, and a world of retribution loomed to an unsatisfied conscience.<a name=6:10></a> Man would animate planets, because they moved without him: he would have poetical lusts in superficial and self-satisfied Greece; more calculated sobriety in Egypt, a sunny south of gods, and northern immensity of giants, and storms, and mountains in Scandinavia; or seek to solve the mystery of good and evil in Ahriman and Ahurmazdha in Arva, or revel in monstrous reveries in India.<a name=6:11></a> Cruelty and poetry might divide the world under the name of gods, but behind all there was everywhere Tertullian's "Testimonium animae naturaliter christianae," an "unknown God" -- a Brahm, the origin of all things, a primeval source or power.<a name=6:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Fetishism -- degraded into a dread of some terrible unknown power, which priests used for their own purposes; in more cultivated religions, kept as the secret mysterious knowledge belonging to them, or to the initiated only, while the vulgar were kept in play with the more convenient everyday materials of popular mythology -- the gods and goddesses of nature and imagination; yet still, though inconsistently, clothing them with attributes and powers which, if true, could only belong to one supreme God.<a name=6:13></a> And this was so true, that each local mythology had this twofold character, and that, even to particular cities.<a name=6:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=7>[Page 7]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In India, in the sects of Vaishnavas and Saivas, and one supreme God above the rest, the idea of God, and attributes of supremacy, omniscience and omnipotence, ran through all, however confused and inconsistent.<a name=7:1></a> These attributes were symbolised, too, as in the winged bulls, and lions, and men of Assyria -- symbols recognised in Scripture; with this immense difference, that in heathen symbols, save in the vague idea of divinity, God was thought of no further than the attributes or symbols.<a name=7:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Judaism, these formed but the throne of a known God who sat above them; the clearest expression, on the one hand, of the mind of man losing itself without God in knowledge it could not retain or carry, and on the other, of the clearness of the revelation which made one true God known.<a name=7:3></a><a href="#7:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> Supremacy, omniscience, omnipotence, attach themselves necessarily to our idea of one God the moment the thought takes a definite form, and the attributes involved in them are not lost in mythological associations.<a name=7:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In heathenism, where these activities are attributed to subordinate energies, the one original God was mere abstract, inert godhead -- abstract existence.<a name=7:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In India, sole existence, sometimes springing into activity of thought and desire, all which became creation, including the gods, and was Maia, or Illusion, and returning into abstract godhead again, when Brahm's occasional activity ceased.<a name=7:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Modern Materialism does little more than substitute scientific activities of nature for poetical activities, and is worth about as much; for after all, we must want a cause.<a name=7:7></a> Phosphorus may put activity into the brain, not moral thought; but what puts activity into phosphorus, or gives it this mental character?<a name=7:8></a> Indeed, wherever I find a regular difference in a like agency, I find a difference-maker!<a name=7:9></a> The tubers of a plant, which convert the elements of the same soil into a geranium or an oak, force on me the conviction of design and mind.<a name=7:10></a>

	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#7:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>See the beginning of Ezekiel: God was seated above these figures. The extreme perverseness, and I must add, superficiality of man's mind and infidelity are shewn in Max Muller's "Science of Religion," and such-like works, licensing and promoting mythology, because it had the thought of God behind it all, as if it were the expression of it; whereas it was the gross departure of man's mind, when he had it, to degrade the idea of God when he had departed from Him; and that in connection with the basest defilement and cruelty, so that God in His true nature and conscience were alike lost -- morally gone -- though neither could be destroyed.

	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not connect omnipresence and eternity as attributes with God, not because they may not, in an ordinary sense, be said to be so; and Scripture itself so speaks practically, and it always speaks practically, because truly; but that in our minds they are connected with time and space, which do not apply to God.<a name=8:1></a> There is no time when God is not; no place where His eye and hand, to use human language, are not.<a name=8:2></a> "I AM" is the proper expression of His existence.<a name=8:3></a> While time rolls on "<i>I am</i>" remains unchanged, and when time has rolled away "<i>I am</i>" subsists the same.<a name=8:4></a> It can hardly be called an attribute.<a name=8:5></a> This being understood, we may speak of eternal as a natural attribute of God.<a name=8:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to omnipresence, God has no more to do with space than with time.<a name=8:7></a> He has created all things in a way apprehensible thus to us.<a name=8:8></a> In this creation nothing escapes Him.<a name=8:9></a> He is, morally speaking, omnipresent.<a name=8:10></a> He is not of, or in it, but pervades it.<a name=8:11></a> He is "through all"!<a name=8:12></a> He upholds everything, as He creates everything.<a name=8:13></a> He is not morally concerned in any motive (save as working in man in grace), but not a sparrow falls to the ground without Him.<a name=8:14></a>

		Omnipotence is involved in this -- the power to do whatever it is His will to do.<a name=8:15></a> Omniscience is involved in it also.<a name=8:16></a> Did not God know all things, He could neither know what to do rightly, nor judge morally.<a name=8:17></a> Supremacy is involved in our very idea of God as one, and active in power.<a name=8:18></a> They are inherent in our idea of God, and (when once the heathenish additions of what are confessedly imaginations are removed) cannot be separated from the idea of God.<a name=8:19></a> That which it is important to get fast hold of is, that there is a will in God.<a name=8:20></a> No moral being can be without it; a will guided by righteousness and holiness, and to which omnipotence and omniscience are subservient, but which is the source and origin of all that exists outside Himself, not of its state, for moral beings have a will, but of its existence.<a name=8:21></a>

		He is a Creator.<a name=8:22></a> I do not say that simple existence can be proved to be a matter of creation by logical deduction.<a name=8:23></a> But simple existence is an abstraction.<a name=8:24></a> Man sees trees, planets moving; in a word, evidence of design, and that, which has been so often argued, involves a designer.<a name=8:25></a> The distinct knowledge of a Creator is a matter of faith.<a name=8:26></a> Yet if man does suppose the abstract existence of matter without a cause, he violates the first principles of necessary thought.<a name=8:27></a> He is accustomed to see man form many things out of comparatively formless matter, so he has an idea of this latter.<a name=8:28></a> But if he begins to think of why anything existed, he cannot avoid the thought of a cause.<a name=8:29></a> Why, implies it?<a name=8:30></a> and I can say Why?<a name=8:31></a> and it is my nature to say Why?<a name=8:32></a> I am so constituted as to look for a cause.<a name=8:33></a> I may not be able to define cause,<a href="#8:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> nor can I conceive creation; but I cannot conceive, on the other hand, a thing existing without it.<a name=8:34></a> My mind may be inert, and so far take what exists as I find it; but as soon as it is in activity, it looks for why a thing exists.<a name=8:35></a> The same thing proves I cannot know a first cause, but only that there must be one.<a name=8:36></a> I cannot conceive a thing existing without a cause, therefore I say there must be one.<a name=8:37></a> But a first cause means what exists without one.<a name=8:38></a> That is, I cannot conceive it.<a name=8:39></a> Hence, too, I cannot conceive creation, though I know there must be a Creator.<a name=8:40></a> It is merely saying, I am a creature, and must think in the order of my being.<a name=8:41></a>

		One class of philosophers -- unable as we are, in the nature of things as creatures, to conceive a creation (for the creature must think in his own order, that is, creature order; he can no more have an idea of creation than create -- power is not in him), judges "Ex nihilo nihil fit.<a name=9:3></a>"<a href="#9:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> For him it is true; but it is only the great fallacy, common to philosophy, of taking our capacity of thought and action as the measure of what may be, which is simply absurd.<a name=9:4></a> It is our measure as to power, be it of thought or action; we must think or act according to our nature, and can think no more as to forming ideas.<a name=9:5></a> But it is wholly false if it deny the consciousness of what is above us and applicable to us receptively.<a name=9:6></a> We may be acted on mentally and physically by that which is no possessed power in us.<a name=9:7></a> Active power or capacity for it is not the measure of receptivity.<a name=9:8></a>

		Morality, or moral obligation, is in the nature of all relations which imply a claim; it is the bond flowing from them.<a name=49:1></a> That man has had all manner of rules is true; but when God says, "The man is become as one of us, knowing good and evil," it certainly implies that right and wrong was of an absolute nature.<a name=49:2></a> But it is the application of a law which makes obligatory a course imposed by authority (though it may be moral too).<a name=49:3></a> The knowledge of good and evil is the perception of it in itself, without a law or its being imposed.<a name=49:4></a> God does know, doubtless, good and evil according to the perfection of His own nature.<a name=49:5></a> But it is a condition of His nature to discern it; it was not of Adam's before his fall.<a name=49:6></a> He was innocent; he enjoyed God's goodness unsuspectingly, and did nothing else.<a name=49:7></a> There was no occasion to discern, nor capacity to do so.<a name=49:8></a> In the fall he acquired this capacity.<a name=49:9></a> He could now say, This is good and that evil; but he was under sin.<a name=49:10></a>

		As regards "relative" and "relationship" (page 45), Mill's adopted statement is poverty and superficiality itself.<a name=61:1></a> It has nothing to do with a series of events.<a name=61:2></a> They <i>may</i> be the fundament<i>um relationis</i>, but cannot be the relation itself.<a name=61:3></a> Relative or relation is merely that a thing is before the mind in relation or reference to something else, not simply in itself, in what it is related.<a name=61:4></a> Where this is an important and constant reference, there is very commonly a word expressing it, as subject, son, father.<a name=61:5></a> And even the verb is so used.<a name=61:6></a> I say, relatively to Asia, India is a small tract of land, but relatively to England a very large one, and so on.<a name=61:7></a> That dissertation relates to political, not physical, geography.<a name=61:8></a> Hence more widely; he related to me his history.<a name=61:9></a> (This may be from another etymological sense of the word.<a name=61:10></a>) At any rate relative is when, in thinking of anything or speaking of anything, my mind or even the word refers to something besides that of which I think or speak, and states, where it is a relative word, the nature of the reference: what I said related to such an one, that is, referred to him.<a name=61:11></a> Hence a relative word is one which expresses this reference, as "son" makes me think of "father," "subject" of "king" or other ruling authority, "citizen" of "state.<a name=61:12></a>" But the thought as to the two is not the same as Mr.<a name=61:13></a> Mill asserts.<a name=61:14></a> The fact is not the same, not even in father and son.<a name=61:15></a> One is the attribute of paternity, the other of filiality.<a name=61:16></a> Begetting is only the way it is formed; father is not a series of events, but present reference to what he is towards a son.<a name=61:17></a> Begetting, in man's case at any rate, is the cause of that, but not it, for it is continuous and begetting is not.<a name=61:18></a> Begetting is not the relationship at all.<a name=61:19></a> It is over before the relationship begins.<a name=61:20></a> So in king and subject.<a name=61:21></a> Subjection is thought of when I say subject, and in the subject; authority in the king, when I say king.<a name=61:22></a> And here by what events he got it has nothing to do with the matter.<a name=61:23></a> It may be birth, conquest, election: the relation is in all cases consequent on an event if referring to it.<a name=61:24></a> It is a character in one which refers to another, and is a link or tie in thought to them.<a name=61:25></a> Mill's account is degrading and false too, for the series of events must be finished before the relationship begins.<a name=61:26></a> But it gives him the opportunity of denying all moral character to it; whereas relationship in living beings gives duties and affections according to the nature of the being.<a name=61:27></a> There is no relationship of this kind between an apple-tree sprung from a pippin and the tree the pippin came from.<a name=61:28></a> I he kind, if according to nature, may be the same.<a name=61:29></a> So that if I say apple, I suppose an apple-tree, but there is no subsisting tie or link formed by God.<a name=61:30></a> In mere animals this is merely animal as long as the necessities of animal nature require it, but that is all.<a name=61:31></a>

		But Mr.<a name=138:8></a> Mill <i>assumes</i> that chemistry, life, social and political questions, are all problems of the same nature; he leaves out not only the whole higher sphere of thought, admitting that induction has made nothing even of most of these, and drawing all his instructions from chemistry and mere physical nature.<a name=138:9></a> But this false view of induction destroys the basis of his reasoning.<a name=138:10></a> And it is every way and wholly false and illogical; for laws are not really causes, and physical laws are not everything -- at any rate cannot be assumed to be such; so that his whole system is false from beginning to end.<a name=138:11></a> The introduction of another element besides physical uniform sequence makes, or may make, all untrue; and it is wholly unfounded.<a name=138:12></a> He is obliged to make human will a mere physical cause or law, having never proved it is so, which makes evidently the whole system foundationless, a rehearsal of chemistry and the way of discovering facts in it, which is not logic (see page 410), but which betrays the system, and shews the flimsiness of the whole of it.<a name=138:13></a>

		I have said that the statement that a miracle can be certified by observation or testimony is important, as it was sought to be proved impossible.<a name=179:15></a> This may be easily understood by the statement, "If an alleged fact be in contradiction, not to any number of approximate generalisations, but to a completed generalisation grounded on a vigorous induction, it is said to be impossible, and to be disbelieved totally.<a name=179:16></a>" (Mill's <i>Logic</i>, 8th edition, chapter 2, page 115.<a name=179:17></a>)

		In sum, we have come to the conclusion, or rather gathered up their admissions, that casual circumstances have taken place revealing power not within their experience or the general laws of science, and of which science can give no account.<a name=180:1></a> And that is just what a miracle is.<a name=180:2></a>

		Let me now consider the way in which scripture presents miracles.<a name=180:3></a> It is alleged, and Christian apologists seem to acquiesce in it, that miracles are the proof of Christianity.<a name=180:4></a> This is a great mistake.<a name=180:5></a> They are graciously given of God in compassion to man's weakness to confirm the word.<a name=180:6></a> But the revelation of God in the word, His nature and actings, are the first things.<a name=180:7></a> Thus we have in Mark 16 the Lord working with them, and confirming the word by signs following; so in Hebrews 1, God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders and with divers miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghost.<a name=180:8></a> And this is so much the case, that a faith <i>founded</i> on miracles is not owned of the Lord: the moral element which links man's quickened soul with God is wanting.<a name=180:9></a> "Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover on the feast day many believed in his name, seeing the miracles which he did; but Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men and needed not that any should testify of man, for he knew what was in man.<a name=180:10></a>" It was a human conclusion, drawn from the testimony of His works, and a just one; there was no new life, no moral renewal, it was "what was in man.<a name=180:11></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence we find as a fact in the ways of God, that, as a rule, miracles were wrought only at the introduction and establishment of a divine religious order, or where it was abandoned by those whom He had not yet abandoned; in a word, where a testimony needed to be confirmed in this way.<a name=180:12></a> Thus Moses wrought miracles, but no prophet in Jerusalem, where (however evil the people were) as a system the religion established by Moses remained, ever wrought miracles.<a name=180:13></a> When Israel had set up the golden calves, and God visited the people to maintain a testimony of the truth for a poor remnant, Elijah and Elisha work miracles.<a name=180:14></a> Again, whatever the miraculous power, it was to confirm the truth proposed, never for self.<a name=180:15></a> Paul leaves Trophimus at Miletus sick.<a name=180:16></a> Yet how many had he healed?<a name=180:17></a> Epaphroditus was sick nigh unto death, but God had mercy on him.<a name=180:18></a> Hence, if a miracle was wrought leading away from divine truth the miracle-worker was to be stoned; Deuteronomy 13.<a name=180:19></a> In mercy to man, adequate outward testimony was given, leaving man without excuse; but faith which God owned rested in the word, and its effectual working morally in the heart.<a name=180:20></a>

		So the Lord puts the double character of His testimony: "If I had not come and spoken to them they had not had sin, but now they have no cloak for their sin.<a name=181:1></a> If I had not done among them the works which none other man did they had not had sin, but now they have both seen and hated both me and my Father.<a name=181:2></a>" But while condemned for rejecting this testimony, faith formed on this alone is not owned, because it was purely human assent and not the moral power of the revelation working in the heart, and faith which is owned is always by the word.<a name=181:3></a> Of His own will begat He us by the word of truth.<a name=181:4></a> "My sheep hear My voice.<a name=181:5></a>" "He that heareth My word and believeth on Him that sent Me hath everlasting life.<a name=181:6></a>" "The words that I have spoken unto you they are spirit and they are life.<a name=181:7></a>" It is equally even the ground of judgment.<a name=181:8></a> "The word that I have spoken the same shall judge him in the last day.<a name=181:9></a>"<a href="#181:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> Thus, while special miracles confirm the truth, yet if they are not attached to the truth known from the word, they are to be rejected.<a name=181:10></a> The word is the test.<a name=181:11></a>

		Further, closely connected with this is the fact that these miracles were entirely separated from any honour attached to the persons who wrought them, though of course they attested the divine character of their ministry; they were wholly a testimony borne to the Living Word, the Lord Jesus Christ, and all He taught.<a name=181:12></a> This is true even as to Moses' works of power; as Exodus 16: 8, and elsewhere, "What are we?<a name=181:13></a> Your.<a name=181:14></a> murmurings are not against us, but against the Lord.<a name=181:15></a>" And when once they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips, saying, "Hear now, ye rebels, must we bring you water out of this rock?<a name=181:16></a>" as an expression of the strict regime of the law, he was not suffered to lead the people into Canaan; Numbers 20: 10.<a name=181:17></a> So, Acts 3: 13, Peter disclaims all regard to himself or John, putting Jesus alone forward.<a name=181:18></a> The Lord's power and resurrection are that to which the miracles testified.<a name=181:19></a> This gives a definite character to them.<a name=181:20></a> There was no personal relief, as we have seen, no self-aggrandisement by them, no glory sought for themselves or for their company.<a name=181:21></a> So Paul and Barnabas; Acts 14: 14.<a name=181:22></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christianity views man as guilty and lost by sin, and (while recognising the law as the just measure of what was required from man, yet none having fulfilled it) purports to be the revelation of God in sovereign goodness to save what was thus lost.<a name=184:4></a> Now, Christ's miracles and those of His disciples were not merely signs of power, but all of them of goodness as well as power.<a name=184:5></a> There is but one absolute exception, and the accessory of another: the cursing of the barren fig-tree, a usual figure of the Israelitish nation, that is, of man under the old covenant (this is finally judged, and it was never to bear fruit); the other was the case of the swine, when the miracle itself was a striking and mighty act of delivering goodness, and a sufferance thereupon of the demons shewing themselves such as they were -- a sad picture of what happened to the Jews when they rejected Christ as the Gadarenes had.<a name=184:6></a> The allowance of the manifestation of the reality of these evil spirits is a remark of one of the old so-called fathers.<a name=184:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		With these exceptions, all the miracles of the Lord were the expression of goodness present in power, that man might be won back to confidence in God.<a name=184:8></a> Every outward effect of sin, all the evil that was in the world, was removed and set aside when met by the power that wrought in goodness amongst men.<a name=184:9></a> This did not change man's heart, but it did reveal God's, and this was what man wanted.<a name=184:10></a> God came into the midst of sinful men shewing that love flowing from His own thoughts and nature was greater than the sin and evil that was in the world.<a name=184:11></a> For what we have in Christianity is what never was before: God come out in grace revealing Himself in goodness when man was a sinner; and man gone in, in righteousness, into the divine glory, so that God's love and God's righteousness should be revealed to sinners far from Him.<a name=184:12></a>

		Now, no one can shew that one miracle of Christ's, or of those sent by Him, was not thus power displayed in a way suited to the present need and sorrow of man.<a name=185:1></a> Moses' miracles, though partly the glorious deliverance of a people and the proof of governmental care, were not always this.<a name=185:2></a> There were judicial wonders suited to the position of the people when God was hid behind the veil and the people placed under the law and tested there.<a name=185:3></a> To be exact, I should add one temporary judgment pronounced by Paul on Elymas (a sad picture of the state of the Jews resisting grace), and, after all, the means of far better blessing to the proconsul, before whom the question of the truth of Christianity was raised.<a name=185:4></a>

		The miracles of Christ were, then, not only perfectly suited to God's nature and character, but perfectly suited to man and the purpose of Christ's mission, and the expression of it where man's heart could feel and understand it.<a name=185:5></a> His birth (if God was to be thus manifested, so that man should learn God's nature and feel His profound interest in him) was exactly what it must have been, a true, real man, born of a woman, but perfectly sinless; such was the suited temple of God as near to man as God could be, and yet God near to him.<a name=185:6></a> As to the resurrection, He having become capable of dying to accomplish the work of redemption, and having accomplished that work, there was the recognition of its effectual value for the justification of everyone that believed.<a name=185:7></a> God had accepted it, and inseparably from this -- a to us -- new life,<a href="#185:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> and a new state of it beyond the effects of sin, in a people of which He was the first-born and head.<a name=185:8></a> And thus mark that all His miracles were an essential part of an immense scheme of truth, the only key to man's state in connection with God's righteousness and mercy, and the only full and real revelation of what He is which exists in the world.<a name=185:9></a> The infidel may condescend to have to say to God, provided He keeps far enough away from him for them to have nothing to do with one another; but this is a revelation, when man, beyond all controversy, is in sin and misery and degradation, as a fact, if there be no revelation -- a revelation of God having to do with him in grace and love, and yet maintaining His holy and righteous nature, no trace of which is found anywhere else.<a name=185:10></a>

		But, further, while miracles were a confirmation of the word, which was the proper and express revelation of God's mind, they were also a testimony in and of themselves; for they told, not simply of power but of goodness, of God working in goodness in the midst of sorrow and misery, and that in the most definite and distinct way.<a name=185:11></a> "He had compassion on the multitude.<a name=185:12></a>" Still there was distinctly and definitely a testimony to the person and truth, or, to speak again as scripture speaks, the grace and truth which came by Jesus Christ, and word and works were a like testimony to it.<a name=185:13></a> Hence, too, both belonged specially to the Person of the Lord and His immediate followers, whose part after His death I will speak of just now.<a name=185:14></a>

		As regards the Gospel to the Hebrews, it can hardly be doubted that Matthew wrote some account of Christ in Hebrew: at any rate early Fathers so state; but, after all, their statements are very vague as to what it was, Epiphanius saying it was corrupted, Jerome that he translated it, which would go to prove that it was not the canonical Matthew.<a name=195:13></a> What did he translate?<a name=195:14></a> It does not affect our Gospel, which is clearly original, as even the language proves.<a name=195:15></a> Jerome says he saw it at Caesarea and translated it; so that there was such in the fourth century.<a name=195:16></a> Still the statements of Jerome are so inconsistent that it is hard to draw any clear conclusion from what he says.<a name=195:17></a> He says he translated it, and that it was practically the same as Matthew: this it certainly was not, by his own testimony elsewhere.<a name=195:18></a> The writers of introductions, Bleek, De Wette, etc.<a name=195:19></a>, say he gave up afterwards this thought, and I suppose did not like saying plainly he had been wrong; but it seems to me the dates do not bear this out.<a name=195:20></a> I do not think he is much to be trusted in the matter.<a name=195:21></a> Papias -- a man <i>sphodra mikros noun</i> -- assumes there was such a Hebrew Gospel by Matthew, but there were afterwards seemingly two differing editions; a few of the "Fathers" accepted it; but Origen, disposed to receive everything, says every one was free to use it if he thought it genuine, only not as authority.<a name=195:22></a> But it was in Aramaean; and there is no proof that Justin, a Greek, understood the tongue.<a name=195:23></a> He was a Greek, and though living in Palestine, it was in the Roman town Flavia Neapolis.<a name=195:24></a> Further, though he preferred being put to death rather than deny Christ, when, as is said, brought to martyrdom through a jealous philosopher, Crescens, yet he never gave up his philosopher's cloak, was a Platonist, and unsound in fundamental doctrines; and, though we cannot doubt his sincerity, was on the surface of Christianity.<a name=195:25></a> At any rate, the Gospel to the Hebrews is surrounded critically with the greatest obscurity, with no proof that Justin understood it, or was one of Papias's "every one interpreted as best he could.<a name=195:26></a>" All this part of the book comes to nothing.<a name=195:27></a>

		To return to Justin Martyr, the author's account of his quotations is not all trustworthy, and all that really bears on the true character of Justin's citation is left out.<a name=198:1></a> In the first place, Justin's manner of quoting is practically that of all the Fathers.<a name=198:2></a> They habitually quote not verbally, but put two passages together if it meets their point, just as Justin does constantly.<a name=198:3></a> Secondly, Justin also quotes very largely indeed from the Old Testament, which there is no question he received as proper scripture, exactly in the same way he does from the New.<a name=198:4></a> He writes as a philosopher to the Gentiles, and habitually quoting the Christian writings, as authority would have been useless.<a name=198:5></a> He calls the Gospels memoirs (a term borrowed probably from Xenophon's account of Socrates, shewing the tone of his mind), the Gospels written by the apostles and their companions, and he says they were read in the Christian assemblies.<a name=198:6></a> He quotes them as such expressly -- seven times we are told by those who have exactly examined the details.<a name=198:7></a> Five agree with our Gospels; the others have variations; one a transposition of words, probably right; the rest inaccurately recorded with the same sense, and two words added -- "and walk" -- found nowhere else.<a name=198:8></a> He gives the substance as it stood in his mind; the common way of patristic quotation, as of our own.<a name=198:9></a>

		As to the other professed quotation, we find it in others of the earliest Fathers in different words and order; and, just as in Justin, by Fathers who beyond all question recognised the four Gospels and nothing else.<a name=198:10></a> That Justin used other traditional accounts, and perhaps the Gospel to the Hebrews, is very likely, There is no question that the four Gospels were held to be of paramount authority at that date.<a name=198:11></a> Tatian's harmony of the four was made only some twenty years after; and Jerome recounts the same of Theophilus a few years still earlier.<a name=198:12></a> When the <i>Supernatural Religion</i> says competent critics agree, it only means the infidel Tubingen school so hold.<a name=198:13></a> Take not only Westcott, who may be thought a prejudiced churchman, but Bleek's introduction, a theologian sober-minded and candid, but as free-thinking as any rationalist could desire, and the statements alleged in <i>Supernatural Religion</i> to be quite certain are treated as certainly false.<a name=198:14></a> The system followed by the author is a mere and evident effort to get rid of the large and developed testimony given with so much fulness in Justin to the Christian Gospels.<a name=198:15></a> The citations, says Bleek, are for the greater part unquestionably taken from our present Gospels.<a name=198:16></a>

E. 6: 12. He had found it in the assembly at Rossus in Cilicia, and not read it through, but hearing some had been misled by it, he got it and read it, and tells them that there was a great deal that was right, but some parts were perverted; but this was in 191, twenty or thirty years after Justin's death. It is mentioned by Origen in Matthew 13: 54-56 (3: 462, De la Rue). But he merely says that it was held by some that James and Jude, etc., were sons of Joseph by a former wife, and that they had received this as a tradition taken from a Gospel entitled of Peter or James. Theodoret mentions it as the Gospel used by the Nazarites. There were two kinds of Ebionites, one using only the Gospel of Hebrews, the other only that of Matthew, so that he had no idea they were the same. The Nazarites, a sort of Unitarians, holding the law as valid, who used only the Gospel of Peter. (Theod. Hoer*. Fab*. 3: 1, 2.) Jerome under Peter, the first of his *De Viris Illus*., says the Gospel of Mark was called the Gospel of Peter; but under Serapion 41 he speaks of a current Gospel under the name of Peter, under James 2 a foolish story out of the Gospel according to the Hebrews, which he says he had lately translated.

	<div class="paragraph">
		The difference of the three synoptical Gospels and the fourth is this.<a name=208:5></a> The three first present Christ as Emmanuel -- Messiah, the prophet-servant, and Son of man, to men, and, in a narrower sense, to the Jews.<a name=208:6></a> Whereas in John this is not the case: it reveals what Christ is in Himself, that the world (when He was in it) did not know Him, though He made it, and that His own rejected Him; but that He put into the place and privilege of sons those who did receive Him: a new thing, but then they were born of God, not of the flesh nor of man's will.<a name=208:7></a> The Jews are therefore treated all through as reprobate, but He declares that He would have His sheep out from their midst, and others from among the Gentiles; and then the Holy Ghost is spoken of as living on the earth instead of Him, when He has gone as man to the Father.<a name=208:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this presentation of Christ in the three first terminates and reaches its climax in the transfiguration, which changed all; for it was as a revelation bringing in a glorified Christ.<a name=208:9></a> This divides the three first Gospels into three parts: the history of the Lord up to the transfiguration (His birth, as Mark gives the prophet, being there left out); the continuance of patient mercy up to blind Bartimaeus, with various instructions, chiefly for the coming time; and, from meeting with the blind man, His last presentation as Son of David to the Jews, and the details of His being taken and crucified.<a name=208:10></a> Miracles Christ wrought at all times, even to the last days, when He was free in the temple, healing the ear of Malchus at the moment of His capture.<a name=208:11></a> Perhaps we may call the greatest of all His living miracles was His giving up His own spirit to His Father on the cross.<a name=208:12></a>

		But, in the active life of Jesus, it is the time which closed in the transfiguration, beginning after His temptation in the wilderness, which forms the proper period of His working miracles as a testimony.<a name=209:1></a> The goodness expressed itself at all times in them, but that on which it rested ("or else, believe me, for the very works' sake") was from His victory over Satan, binding the strong man, till the transfiguration revealed a wholly new order of things coming in connected with a rejected Christ, from which time He forbade His disciples to tell men that He was the Messiah, saying the <i>Son of man</i> must suffer, though still till His hour was come continuing His work of grace.<a name=209:2></a> The general character of the Lord's miracles I have spoken of.<a name=209:3></a> The revelation of God in power and goodness is that He might be known and trusted by man, and man, wicked as he might be, have confidence in Him.<a name=209:4></a> As the beginning of Eve's sin was losing confidence in God's goodness by the guile of Satan (if God did not seek their happiness fully, they must seek it for themselves, as even now), hence will, lust, transgression; so now, God was there to give in perfect goodness a blessed ground of confidence in Himself; but, I add here, so graciously and perfectly suited to the state and need of man.<a name=209:5></a> The person who can be insensible to the perfectness of the revelation of God in goodness to man, in Christ down here, is incapable of feeling what God and goodness are.<a name=209:6></a>

		But I turn now to look at the miracles recorded in particular as suited to the special testimony given, and first at Matthew.<a name=209:7></a> The general testimony is in chapter 4: 23.<a name=209:8></a> "And Jesus went about all Galilee teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people," or, as expressed by Peter (Acts 10), went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil, for God was with Him.<a name=209:9></a> Matthew's testimony is to the Lord as Emmanuel and as Jesus, that is, Jehovah the Saviour.<a name=209:10></a> For He shall save His people from their sins.<a name=209:11></a> He was Jehovah; but first of all Jehovah, according to promise to His own people.<a name=209:12></a> Hence His genealogy is traced from Abraham, and also David, to whose seed the promises were made; as Paul states it in the Romans, of the seed of David according to the flesh, a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to perform the promises made to the fathers.<a name=209:13></a> As this He was rejected; and then comes in another character and title, proved Son of God with power, according to the "Spirit of holiness by resurrection of the dead.<a name=209:14></a>" This last, on which Christianity is really based, is not our subject.<a name=209:15></a>

		ON MYSTICISM
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>Montpellier, May 29th, 1849</i>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Dear Brother, -- While travelling I read your "Life of Madame de Krudener," and I must tell you that it did me good.<a name=218:1></a> Occupation, without any relaxation, tends, if one is not very near the Lord, to impair the most intimate affections; and when the details of the work constitute the chief part of such occupation, they tend to narrow the heart.<a name=218:2></a> It is not so the moment one is near Him: then, on the contrary, such details exercise the best affections; and we delight ourselves in Him.<a name=218:3></a> It was so with Christ, because His life of details flowed from the fact that He lived by His Father, and was nothing else than the perfect manifestation, in man, of what the Father was.<a name=218:4></a> It was the produce of a heart filled with a perfect love, the expression of an infinite love.<a name=218:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The life of Madame de Krudener, which was passed outside the narrowness of secondary questions, recalled to me this love; for she certainly had a heart of spiritual love for the Lord; and, for my part, I have no difficulty in judging the things that are to be condemned in her walk, so that I need not dwell upon them.<a name=218:6></a> The one who is constantly a working bee within the hive, is free to gather only honey when he approaches flowers in the open air, whatever they may be.<a name=218:7></a> But I will say a few words as to what strikes me when I consider mysticism, as it is found in its best forms in Madame de Krudener and others.<a name=218:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Desire and love may be very exactly distinguished.<a name=218:9></a> Desire supposes the capacity to enjoy the thing we desire, that is to say, spiritual affections, which, as to their very nature, have God for their object.<a name=218:10></a> It supposes one to be born of Him, although Satan often, in an astonishing manner, imitates this class of feelings; but this state also supposes that one does not possess what one desires.<a name=218:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Love supposes that we have full possession of the object of our desires.<a name=218:12></a> It is no longer a want, but enjoyment, appreciation, delight in the object itself.<a name=218:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now mysticism, while boasting much of its feelings, never gets beyond desire; while simple Christianity, giving the knowledge of salvation, puts us into full possession of the love of God.<a name=218:14></a> I know that He loves Christ; that love has saved me; it was He who desired me.<a name=218:15></a> In love He had need of me; and this love is perfection in Christ.<a name=218:16></a> In peace I contemplate this love, and I adore it in Christ.<a name=218:17></a> I dwell in Him and He in me.<a name=218:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have never seen a mystic whose idea of love was not entirely at fault in its nature: it was something in <i>man</i>, which needed to be satisfied, instead of being something in God, which satisfied the heart deeply, infinitely, and perfectly.<a name=219:1></a> Thence unheard-of efforts to abase oneself, to vilify oneself, and to speak evil of oneself, as if a saved one could be anything in the presence of a Saviour, instead of being nothing and forgetting himself in the presence of so much love.<a name=219:2></a> When one is truly delighted in the presence of God, and beholding His excellent beauty in His temple, is one occupied with the hideous forms which hide themselves in the heart of man?<a name=219:3></a> I think not.<a name=219:4></a> We think of Him.<a name=219:5></a> He has given us the right to do so, by a grace which has really set aside all that we were as alive out of Christ, as in the flesh.<a name=219:6></a> Do we then make no humbling experience of self?<a name=219:7></a> I say not so.<a name=219:8></a> Yes, there are moments when God reveals to us the frightful secrets of that heart in which no good exists; but we do not boast, we do not say much of it, if we have truly seen God.<a name=219:9></a> If we try to find in man, in his love to God, something as good as the love of God to us, then we talk about it, and fancy we are humbling ourselves.<a name=219:10></a> This is but the vanity of the heart which knows not God, and knows not itself either; it is the true character of mysticism.<a name=219:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But does not such a sight of God produce a humiliating knowledge of self?<a name=219:12></a> Yes, when we have not known what we are, nor known the gospel which gives us the right to say, "It is no more I that live.<a name=219:13></a>" Such was the case with Job, as with many others.<a name=219:14></a> He had thought of himself, of the grace <i>in</i> him; then he had to learn himself in the presence of God.<a name=219:15></a> But the gospel is the <i>answer</i> to all these disturbances of the soul, by the revelation of what God is, and of what God has done for him whom He knew to the.<a name=219:16></a> bottom, just as he was, and who has learned in the cross of Jesus what the love of God is when there was nothing but sin, and sin seen by God as we could not see it, but seen only to be the occasion of a perfect work of love.<a name=219:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God in His holiness, His majesty, His righteousness, His love, has found His rest in the work and Person of Christ: I have found mine there.<a name=219:18></a> The mystic never has rest, because he vainly seeks in man what he ought to seek in God, who had accomplished all before he ever thought about it.<a name=219:19></a> This is why they seek a <i>disinterested love</i>; but where?<a name=219:20></a> In man!<a name=219:21></a> Poor worshippers of man deified in their imagination; of a man who will never be found!<a name=219:22></a> Here sin is in him, in heaven he will think only of God.<a name=219:23></a> This is why the imagination plays so great a part in mysticism, and Satan can so often deceive by it, because the imagination and the heart of man are called into play.<a name=219:24></a> I do not say that spiritual affections are never there: far from it; nor that God never reveals Himself to such affections.<a name=219:25></a> I doubt not that He does it and thus renders the person happy, but you will find him, after all, occupied with the affections and not with God Himself.<a name=219:26></a> It is the chief defect of mysticism.<a name=219:27></a> In a word, I see it in an effort of the human heart, trying to produce in itself something strong enough in the way of affection to satisfy a heart awakened by the excellence of its Object: for I am now supposing a true awakening of the heart.<a name=219:28></a>

		Are there not, then, these exercises of the soul's desire before God?<a name=220:7></a> Yes; but this again brings out a marked difference.<a name=220:8></a> Before having understood redemption through the cross and our portion in Christ, which is its consequence, the awakened soul is exercised; it often seeks peace and rest in a spiritual progress and a love for God which are never found.<a name=220:9></a> But the effect of all this exercise, under grace, is to bring the <i>conscience</i> into play and to produce the conviction of its uselessness; that in us, that is, in our flesh, dwells no good thing.<a name=220:10></a> <i>Conscience</i> takes full account of what passes in the heart and of what we are, so that we are brought to renounce all attempt to find peace in the state of our souls.<a name=220:11></a> We need to be pardoned, saved; we place ourselves at the foot of the cross, but not as having immutable affections.<a name=220:12></a> We have discovered that we have them not, and it is not only the heart which is troubled by this, although such is the case, but conscience knows that we are lost, dead under condemnation.<a name=220:13></a> We see things as they are in the presence of God; we need to be saved.<a name=220:14></a> We no longer seek good in ourselves, under the form of divine affections; but we find it in God, in His kindness towards us by Christ Jesus; and we have peace.<a name=220:15></a>

		The truth is this: there is still conflict because the flesh is in us, and the Holy Ghost has sometimes to occupy us with ourselves, and to humble us.<a name=221:13></a> God being Infinite and His work perfect, there is always in Him, even when our peace is perfect, that which awakens all the energy of an affection which cannot satisfy itself, although perfectly assured of the love of Him with whom it has to do.<a name=221:14></a> This suits the relations of a creature with God, and it is a good thing for us and does not lessen our peace.<a name=221:15></a> It is quite a different thing from the mystic desire to love, which is true, but which turns in upon self, because it knows neither God nor self.<a name=221:16></a> Yet I find my heart so cold that it sometimes does me good, because I know well enough that I was lost and am saved, not to mix this with my knowledge of a free salvation, accomplished without me, and which fully glorifies God, and God alone.<a name=221:17></a> But it often does harm to souls who have not been emptied before God, not having had the work transferred from the heart to the conscience in His presence.<a name=221:18></a>

		I have said that I take, as given, the worldly form of the book, and that you have therefore left to each the responsibility of forming a judgment for himself on the worldly life of Madame de Krudener, by passing lightly, and without remark, over her wanderings; the grace which pardoned all being the true contrast to the evil.<a name=223:1></a> I think that this reproduced itself and is found again in her spiritual wanderings, for the ways of God are just.<a name=223:2></a>

		One more remark about Madame de Krudener, without doubt less important, but, I think, true.<a name=225:7></a> There was in her a lack of spiritual originality, not of sincerity: this serious fault betrays itself also in her work, and, among other things, has given it its character.<a name=225:8></a> She received impressions from Jung Stilling, from Oberlin, from Tersteegen, from Maria Kummrin.<a name=225:9></a> Perhaps this was natural in a woman; but that is why a woman cannot be a principal agent in the work.<a name=225:10></a> It is contrary to the ways of God.<a name=225:11></a> She may help, GREATLY help, but not be a principal agent; she may do things man cannot do, but not do what he does.<a name=225:12></a> This is true in a more important point of view.<a name=225:13></a> She could not receive from Christ impulses for a position which He did not give her.<a name=225:14></a> The love of Christ was there; the impulse came from elsewhere.<a name=225:15></a> Now, when it is Christ Himself who sets the heart in motion, He acts upon the man, as He also forms in us that new man whom the wicked one <i>touches not</i>.<a name=225:16></a> His presence acts upon the conscience, silences the flesh, makes nothing of man -- his vanity, his self-love, and his good opinion of himself.<a name=225:17></a> The whole man is judged in His presence, and the work produced is of Christ Himself, whatever may be the vessel.<a name=225:18></a> If there is a danger of its being otherwise, a thorn in the flesh is sent.<a name=225:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When we receive our impressions and impulses second-hand, the flesh and the heart are not judged at all, although the love may be in us.<a name=225:20></a> Flesh and the heart are reproduced, and the agent is exposed, by his very activity, to all sorts of traps of the enemy, which, on their part again, are reproduced in the work.<a name=225:21></a> This was the case with Madame de Krudener; but she certainly will not lose the fruit of her devotedness, of which I do not in the least, for my own part, doubt the sincerity.<a name=225:22></a> But there was too much of man in her, and man is always false.<a name=225:23></a> It is so true (it is important to notice it) that, while tasting the love of Christ, she never really knew the gospel, as being herself in the presence of God, until her last illness.<a name=225:24></a> And then she immediately perceived that she had often mistaken her imagination for the voice of God; for it is only there that man dies, and that God shews Himself alone such as He is.<a name=225:25></a> Now as long as man is not dead, Satan can use him, and spiritual discernment is wanting.<a name=225:26></a> The fact of the accomplishment of visions proves nothing in these things.<a name=225:27></a> All that also accompanies the power of the enemy; but the spiritual man, being humble, easily judges these things when God places him before them, and when he takes the word of God as the absolute guide of his judgment.<a name=225:28></a>

		ON THE GOVERNMENT OF GOD AND HIS COUNSELS IN GRACE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Although we may speak of change or variety in the revealed ways of God, there are certain fundamental principles of His acting which remain unchanged.<a name=227:1></a> These are things which flow from the nature of God, and must be.<a name=227:2></a> So a man "must be born again" to enter the kingdom of God, whether the man is Adam, or Paul, or any one else; he must get a nature which can enjoy God.<a name=227:3></a> So also as sinners we must be washed in the precious blood of Christ before we can have any part with God.<a name=227:4></a> But the character of His ways, His mode of acting, is not always the same.<a name=227:5></a> And this is simple; for our individual salvation and what concerns this is not the first thing in God's revelation, but the glory of God.<a name=227:6></a> He is displaying His glory, and He has ways of glorifying Himself.<a name=227:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two great subjects set before us in scripture in connection with this (that is, always supposing salvation settled, as the groundwork of all for us; for it is not till we are born again, and have peace with God, that we are free to enter into His mind as revealed), viz.<a name=227:8></a> --
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1st, The government of God in this world; and

	<div class="paragraph">
		2nd, The sovereign grace which gives sinners a place according to His own counsels.<a name=227:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a direct government of God, and there is the exercise of sovereign grace which gives special blessing in His own presence.<a name=227:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Jews are the centre of the one, and the church of the other, after Christ, of course, who is the Centre of all.<a name=227:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		By the government of God in the world I do not mean that universal government which He exercises over the universe -- what is called providence -- in the exercise of which even "a sparrow does not fall to the ground" without Him; but the direct government of God on the earth.<a name=227:12></a> There is no doubt He also deals in government with His children even now, but as to this world the Jews were the centre of His acting in that respect.<a name=227:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will see what I mean in Deuteronomy 32: 8, 9.<a name=227:14></a> "When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the peoples (not people) according to the number of the children of Israel; for Jehovah's portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.<a name=227:15></a>"

		"Most High" is always the name of God used to denote Him as supreme over the earth.<a name=228:1></a> See, for instance, what Melchisedec said to Abraham, when he came out to meet him, after the defeat of the kings who had carried off Lot, "Blessed be Abram of the Most High God, possessor of heaven and earth" (Genesis 14: 19); and also in Daniel 4: 24, 25,9 where God is announced by this name to Nebuchadnezzar as the One who in His government of the earth was about to interfere in judgment upon him.<a name=228:2></a> "This is the decree of the Most High which is come upon my lord the king: that they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.<a name=228:3></a>" And this is also what Nebuchadnezzar was brought to own as the fruit of that dealing.<a name=228:4></a> See verses 33-36.<a name=228:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In connection with the earth and His people at different times, God has revealed Himself by different names, which are characteristic of different relationships.<a name=228:6></a> It is, of course, always the same God, although known in a different relation.<a name=228:7></a> In Psalm 91 we get all these names of God (except Father, which was not then revealed) grouped together in their proper connection.<a name=228:8></a> "He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.<a name=228:9></a> I will say of Jehovah, he is my refuge and my fortress: My God [Elohim]; in him will I trust.<a name=228:10></a>" That is, he who has the secret of who the Most High is, shall have the blessings of Abraham's God.<a name=228:11></a> Jehovah is the God of the Jews, and so Messiah, in the second verse, answers as it were, the riddle put in the first, saying, "I will say of Jehovah, He is my refuge and my fortress: my Elohim; in him will I trust.<a name=228:12></a>" In verses 3-8 the Spirit declares the consequences of this (verse 9 is the Jewish people speaking), and Jehovah puts His seal upon it in verses 14-16.<a name=228:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God revealed Himself to Abraham as "the Almighty" (El Shaddai).<a name=228:14></a> Abraham was called to be a pilgrim, with none but God to look to, so He is revealed to Him as the "All Powerful One.<a name=228:15></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To the Jews He is "Jehovah," the force of which is, "Is, and was, and is to come.<a name=228:16></a>" See Exodus 6: 2, 3: "And God said unto Moses, I am Jehovah.<a name=228:17></a> And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob by the name of God Almighty, but by my name Jehovah was I not known to them.<a name=228:18></a>" (See also Exodus 3: 18; 5: 3; 7: 16; 9: 1, etc.<a name=228:19></a>)

		THE COMING OF THE LORD -- THAT WHICH CHARACTERISES THE CHRISTIAN LIFE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I purpose to take up a subject which I feel to be deeply important -- the coming of the Lord Jesus -- and to take it up, not proving it as a doctrine, but shewing that it was originally a substantial part of Christianity itself.<a name=245:1></a> The groundwork is Christ's first coming, and His atoning death; but when we look beyond the foundation, then we see that the coming of the Lord Jesus is not merely a bit of knowledge, but a substantive part of the faith of the church of God, and that on which the moral state of the saints, and, indeed, of the church of God, depends.<a name=245:2></a> You will see, in going through the passages which I will now quote, that it connects itself and is mixed with every part of Christianity, characterises it, and connects itself with every thought and feeling of the Christian.<a name=245:3></a> A person could not read the scriptures with an unprejudiced mind without seeing it: it presents itself to you in almost every page.<a name=245:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Some people have taken the pains to count how many times it occurs; but what I say is not merely this, but that it is so connected with every part of Christian life that, if you take it out, you take away what gives its character to the whole Christian life.<a name=245:5></a> It was identified with the system as announced to the world.<a name=245:6></a> I take conversion: people say what has that to do with the Lord's coming?<a name=245:7></a> That is part of what they were converted to: "to wait for God's Son from heaven.<a name=245:8></a>" This waiting for God's Son from heaven characterised their conversion.<a name=245:9></a> They were converted to serve God, surely; but, also, "to wait for his Son from heaven," 1 Thessalonians 1: 10.<a name=245:10></a>

		There are two subjects with which scripture is occupied, when personal salvation is settled: one is the sovereign grace, which makes us, redeemed from sin, like Christ in the glory: this is the blessed portion of the church of God; and the other is the government of the world.<a name=245:11></a> The Jews are the centre of the government of this world; Deuteronomy 32: 8.<a name=245:12></a> "When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.<a name=245:13></a> For Jehovah's portion is his people, Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.<a name=245:14></a>" There we get, in the government of the world, Israel as the centre.<a name=245:15></a> Israel would not have Christ, and so was set aside for the time.<a name=245:16></a> God's throne was taken from Jerusalem at the Babylonish captivity, but a remnant spared and brought back, that the king might be presented to them; but Him they refused, and are now set aside till His return.<a name=245:17></a> There are only sixty-nine weeks of Daniel definitely<a href="#245:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> fulfilled.<a name=245:18></a> The last week is not fulfilled; it is not come.<a name=245:19></a>

		But here the other blessed work of God comes in, that meanwhile God is calling out poor sinners to have a part with His Son, and be like His Son; for we are predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He may be the firstborn among many brethren.<a name=246:4></a> He has taken us poor sinners to have us in the same glory as His Son.<a name=246:5></a> That is another thing from prophecy, which gives us the portion of this world and the Jewish people.<a name=246:6></a> When He shall appear, we shall appear with Him in glory.<a name=246:7></a>

		As to the death of a saint, they were so thoroughly looking for the Lord, that if a person died they thought he would not be there, ready to go to meet Him.<a name=247:14></a> They were wrong in this, and the apostle corrects their mistake.<a name=247:15></a> But now people say, when a saint dies, we shall go after him, we shall follow him.<a name=247:16></a> Here there is not a word about it.<a name=247:17></a> Suppose I were to go and say to a Christian now, who had lost some one dear to him: "Do not be uneasy, Christ will bring him with Him," he would think me wild, or find it utterly unintelligible; and yet that is the way the apostle does comfort them: "Them that sleep in Jesus will God bring with him" (chapter 4).<a name=247:18></a> He then shews the way He will do it: "We which are alive .<a name=247:19></a>.<a name=247:20></a>.<a name=247:21></a> shall not prevent them which are asleep.<a name=247:22></a>" "Prevent" is an old word for anticipate or go before.<a name=247:23></a> The first thing the Lord will do when He descends is to raise the sleeping saints.<a name=247:24></a> He is going to bring them with Him: if they have fallen asleep in Him, their spirits will have been with Him meanwhile; but then they will receive glory, be raised in glory, be like Him, as they had been like the first Adam, and, going to meet Him in the air, will be for ever with Him; and when He appears He will bring them with Him, and they will appear with Him in glory.<a name=247:25></a>

		The Jews chose to take the promises, not on the ground of the faith of Abraham, but on that of their own obedience conditionally; and the moment they got on this ground they failed.<a name=258:1></a> They tried to do some good thing, like the young man in the Gospels, who, wrong in principle, knew not that "none is good, save one, that is, God.<a name=258:2></a>" Israel took the law, not on the ground of promise, but of law.<a name=258:3></a> The law rests on the stability of another party; the promise rests on the stability of the Promiser.<a name=258:4></a> The prophets always take Israel off the ground of law on that of promise.<a name=258:5></a> In taking the law they must rest on descent and ordinances; and this is what the apostle combats in Romans 3 and 4.<a name=258:6></a> Up to chapter 3 he proves the universality of the guilt of the world, and the necessity of the blood of Christ to cleanse from sin.<a name=258:7></a> In chapter 4 we have the principle of the resurrection.<a name=258:8></a> He leads us out of natural life, out of the law, into the Spirit of life that is in Christ Jesus.<a name=258:9></a> Chapter 8 plants the Christian in his own proper place in the grace of God.<a name=258:10></a>

		Then the apostle turns to the question of what becomes of the Jew.<a name=258:11></a> Has God cast them off?<a name=258:12></a> No; their bringing in again rests on the promise of God in resurrection, as we read in the Acts, "And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, no more to return to corruption, he saith on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David.<a name=258:13></a>" The apostle's argument in chapter 9 is just this: he asserts God's title (the election of the nation of the Jews still subsisting) to elect whom He pleases.<a name=258:14></a> How come believers to have all these privileges mentioned in chapter 8?<a name=258:15></a> Because they are God's election; the principle is in God, not in the circumstance only of the election of Israel.<a name=258:16></a> Christ, while necessarily the root of blessing, is also the object of the promises.<a name=258:17></a>

		As to the word "mystery," I believe, in principle, it may be thus explained.<a name=261:14></a> There is such a thing as loving righteousness and hating iniquity acting on the conscience: "Thou shalt not kill," for instance; there is no mystery in this.<a name=261:15></a> God could not deal in righteousness with the world.<a name=261:16></a> We know how it failed in this.<a name=261:17></a> Then the secret came in.<a name=261:18></a> Anything that was above and beyond the principle of the law of righteousness were "the secret things," Deuteronomy 29: 29.<a name=261:19></a> "The secret of Jehovah is with them that fear him," and here comes in faith.<a name=261:20></a> The bringing in of the Gentiles, for instance, to be one body, the body of Christ, was known only by fresh revelation.<a name=261:21></a><a name=262>[Page 262]</a>

		All that is consequent upon man's sin can hardly be "the mystery of iniquity.<a name=262:1></a>" The mystery of iniquity is Satan's taking the form of God's goodness, and claiming the worship that belongs to Him; as what the apostle calls the worshipping of angels (referring to something that was not of God), will-worship, and the satisfying of the flesh.<a name=262:2></a> Paul was, when he came to be the object of worship, a more dangerous demon than Theseus or Apollo.<a name=262:3></a> (See Acts 14.<a name=262:4></a>) The way to judge of a thing is by the way in which it acts on the conscience, and the tendency of it is to draw away the soul from God and His worship.<a name=262:5></a> The Athenians worshipping the "unknown God" shew the very extremity of evil -- the confession that in utter iniquity they did not know God.<a name=262:6></a>

		Then as to "apostasy," it is simply the departure from the principle of faith, on which the dispensation is based, to the law for instance, the very taking of which at Sinai was an evidence of Jewish unbelief.<a name=262:7></a> God had borne them on eagles' wings on their way, given them manna for their food, held them up in blessed dependence on the constant exercises of His grace; but they chose conditions of their own, and then departed from the first principle of obedience.<a name=262:8></a> "Thou shalt have none other gods but me.<a name=262:9></a>" Man's doing was making the calf.<a name=262:10></a> When it was made, Providence, they said, did it (as Aaron told Moses, "I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf"); then they worshipped it.<a name=262:11></a> When Moses saw it, he had it ground to powder, and made them drink it with water.<a name=262:12></a> This was faith.<a name=262:13></a>

		The church is set on the ground of faith, on the discovery that the flesh has utterly failed, and that the risen Saviour has to be looked to; but it has departed in principle from being in the favour of God in grace as united to Jesus, and the apostasy is coming in.<a name=262:14></a> The record of the apostasy is in Jude and John especially.<a name=262:15></a> The spirit of Antichrist is not merely natural enmity to God, but "they went out from us because they were not of us.<a name=262:16></a>" There is no hope at all then of restoration.<a name=262:17></a> There is unbelief; and is this continuing in God's goodness?<a name=262:18></a> "That day shall not come except there come a falling away first.<a name=262:19></a>" The flesh always fails in the deposit entrusted to it.<a name=262:20></a> This is apostasy, darkening God's light.<a name=262:21></a> The flesh may have the form and keep up the form, but it will end in apostasy.<a name=262:22></a> What does Stephen say as to the rejection of the Holy Ghost by the Jews in that dispensation?<a name=262:23></a> He does not refer so much to the rejection of Christ or of the intermediate prophets, but he goes back to their original departure from God in the wilderness.<a name=262:24></a>

		I feel strongly that one has to cast oneself on the Spirit of God, for speaking of mere circumstances sometimes creates difficulty.<a name=267:1></a> I would say that it has struck me, where the King is spoken of, the bride is Jerusalem; when the Lamb is spoken of, the bride is the heavenly Jerusalem.<a name=267:2></a> Of course, there are many analogous principles in both.<a name=267:3></a> Psalm 45 is entirely about the King's wife -- the Revelation entirely about the Lamb's.<a name=267:4></a> Assuredly there is a good deal of interest in seeing the different characters of blessing in their relationships.<a name=267:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I see two grand characteristics in the Lord's dealings: the one that of righteousness, as it is said, "The righteous Lord loveth righteousness, his countenance doth behold the upright"; and the other grace.<a name=267:6></a> Not that in His dealings in grace He gives up righteousness, but righteousness, simply as righteousness, could not be to sinners; for they needed grace, which is maintained in righteousness in the Lord Jesus.<a name=267:7></a> The position of the church, as knowing divine righteousness in Him, comprehends the character of grace.<a name=267:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I see this distinction going on all through.<a name=267:9></a> In Isaiah 60 we have the King and the bride.<a name=267:10></a> God could not identify Himself with His people Israel when they failed in their responsibility to Him, and He cast them off; but when, in Isaiah 60, we see them in the stability of glory, their iniquity having been forgiven and carried away into the land of forgetfulness, "the sons of the strangers are to build their walls, and the nation and kingdom that will not serve them are to perish," etc.<a name=267:11></a> They will exercise dominion, but not in grace; power is mentioned in the seat of righteousness at Jerusalem.<a name=267:12></a> This made the apostle cry out, "O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!<a name=267:13></a> how unsearchable are his ways, and his judgments past finding out!<a name=267:14></a>"

		He saw Jerusalem to be the place, properly speaking, of righteousness, and yet if God had received the Jew on his own proper ground of righteousness without Christ, it would have been unrighteous, for they were transgressors.<a name=267:15></a> But they rejected the Messiah and hated the gospel to the Gentiles, and this brought out the fulness of their iniquity, and if God concluded all in unbelief, it was thus that God might have mercy upon all.<a name=267:16></a> The just "as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief; even so have these also not now believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy," has been brought forward to prove that through the mercy of the church the Jews are to come in.<a name=267:17></a> But it should be rendered, "even so have these also now not believed in your mercy, that they also may be the objects of mercy.<a name=267:18></a>" They would not believe in the Gentiles' mercy, and are themselves therefore made the objects of mercy.<a name=267:19></a> Even the Jew, who stood on the principle of righteousness, comes in on the ground of mercy.<a name=267:20></a>

		We see how different the character of the bride, the Lamb's wife, is from that spoken of in Isaiah 60.<a name=268:1></a> In the first place, of the former it is said, the nations [of them which are saved] shall walk in the light of it, etc.<a name=268:2></a>; not only light goes out from it, but life and grace are its characteristics.<a name=268:3></a> The fulness of the love and grace of Christ is expressed in His receiving the church, and it becomes His helpmeet in expressing His grace in that day.<a name=268:4></a> In the second place, of the latter it is said, "For the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish; yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted," Isaiah 60: 12.<a name=268:5></a>

		As regards the heavenly Jerusalem, it is not righteousness maintained in power, but grace that will be its characteristic.<a name=268:6></a> There is nothing more instructive than taking that which is to be the character of the heavenly Jerusalem, and comparing it with that of the church now.<a name=268:7></a> We ought to be now anticipating what we shall become actually in the day when the Lord gives us glory.<a name=268:8></a> Nothing that defiles was to enter into that heavenly city: the leaves of the trees were for the healing of the nations, etc.<a name=268:9></a> -- this should be the character of the church now, purity, love, and grace towards the world.<a name=268:10></a> Our place is just that of drawing down now the character of grace that will be displayed in the glory.<a name=268:11></a> We do not see in the heavenly Jerusalem the security of righteousness exhibiting itself in power against others, but in grace.<a name=268:12></a> Paradise knew nothing of grace; innocent men might live in it; but there was no tree of life there for those who had failed.<a name=268:13></a> We read that "the streets of the city were pure gold.<a name=268:14></a>" Gold is that which the mercy-seat and girdle were made of.<a name=268:15></a> Righteousness is the very walking place of the saints there.<a name=268:16></a> Instead of its defiling us, as the world does now, and making our feet need the washing of our High Priest, the very place on which they walk will be the righteousness of God.<a name=268:17></a> "Transparent glass" denotes true holiness The character of the divine purity is aimed at in the laver, ministering death and resurrection.<a name=268:18></a> Then the place of our conversation, that on which we stand and walk, will be righteousness and true holiness.<a name=268:19></a> In us the world will see that glory which we shall see immediately.<a name=268:20></a> "Every several gate was of one pearl.<a name=268:21></a>" They will discern in us then the beauty and comeliness which Jesus will have put on us.<a name=268:22></a>

		The greatest part of the church's blessing consists in being united with the Lord Himself.<a name=270:1></a> It is not merely that it is glorified and loved, but the Father loves us as He loves Jesus.<a name=270:2></a> The best proof of this love is that He has given Jesus for us.<a name=270:3></a> That love which is brought out through the glory associates the church with the Son: He comes in the glory, and the glory which it will have is consequent on love.<a name=270:4></a> The source of the glory which will be displayed is more blessed even than the manifestation of it.<a name=270:5></a> It is blessed to be manifested in favour; and why?<a name=270:6></a> Because the favour of the person is precious to me.<a name=270:7></a> In John 17: 23 the Lord prays that the world may know that "thou hast loved them as thou hast loved me.<a name=270:8></a>" While the Lord has obtained all for us, yet, when He comes to give His bride her glory, He does not say that it is a proof that He has loved her; but, in the blessed self-hiding of love, He says that it is the Father's love: "and thou hast loved them as thou hast loved me.<a name=270:9></a>" This is exceedingly blessed and beautiful.<a name=270:10></a> The Lord gives witness before the world, not that He loves her, for this was shewn in the necessity of her sinfulness.<a name=270:11></a> There is nothing more precious than the love between the church and Himself; but to the world He exhibits the church as loved by the Father, which gives it honour, not in connection with sin and shame.<a name=270:12></a> We see the same principle brought out in the history of the prodigal son, however touching that love may be between the ruined sinner and the Father, which causes Him to fall on his neck and kiss him; yet before the servants He takes him home in honour, with the best robe on, and the ring on his hand, etc.<a name=270:13></a>

		The heavenly Jerusalem is shewn [in Revelation 21] to be really of divine source, "descending out of heaven, having the glory of God.<a name=271:1></a>" When we think about sin, without reference to the glory of God, we come short of a right estimate of it.<a name=271:2></a> The moment we have tasted of the "glory of God," compared with this everything is sin.<a name=271:3></a> The blessing of the church must not come short of this glory.<a name=271:4></a> The Father has loved the church and given it to the Son.<a name=271:5></a> The bride is taken out of Christ (as shewn in Genesis 2 if not Psalm 139: 15, 16), and has the "glory of God.<a name=271:6></a>" Man, having got the knowledge of good and evil, must either be miserable in using knowledge against God, or by faith rise above the evil as God is above it.<a name=271:7></a> Hence it is this which is the place of the church in union with Christ, and grace is wrought into glory.<a name=271:8></a> We see that "the glory of God did lighten it," and that the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it, not the Father.<a name=271:9></a> While God unfolds Himself in His various characters, in His wisdom, in different dispensations, the very place of the worship of the church is that which is the whole display of God's wisdom and power: "the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.<a name=271:10></a>" In Ephesians 3: 21 we read, "unto him be glory in the church, by Christ Jesus, throughout all ages, world without end.<a name=271:11></a>" This seems to raise the church as the crown of all dispensations, set up as over, and the link of God with, all dispensations.<a name=271:12></a> The glory will then be His: "to him be glory in the church," etc.<a name=271:13></a>, according to the power which worketh in us.<a name=271:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In revealing God there are three great characters in the dispensations: first, that of Almighty; then of Jehovah; then that of Father.<a name=271:15></a> The apostle, in 2 Corinthians 6, speaking of the place of the church as being separate from the world, says, "wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.<a name=271:16></a>" This was the first character in which God manifested Himself in dispensation; but at this time God Almighty did not say, I am your Father.<a name=271:17></a> The very principle and essence of this present time is that God is revealed in the character of Father.<a name=271:18></a> Jehovah and Almighty are not the proper relations of God to us.<a name=271:19></a> When the glory comes, there will be the full perfection of everything: "The Lord God Almighty and the Lamb.<a name=271:20></a>" The Lord God Almighty as concerns the glory, and the Lamb as having brought us into security through His sufferings, are united.<a name=271:21></a> For eternity, in chapter 21: 1-8, it is simply, "the glory of God did lighten it," etc.<a name=271:22></a> We have nothing about the Lamb after the millennium: the bride, the Lamb's wife, will be His helpmeet, as the minister of grace, and God is the Most High.<a name=271:23></a>

		I would now turn to the question of Messiah's kingdom.<a name=272:1></a> There is a difference between the state of things in which there is a King reigning in righteousness, and "the new heavens and the new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.<a name=272:2></a>" If it dwells there, there is no need for rule.<a name=272:3></a> When there is a liability to evil, we want power to secure good.<a name=272:4></a> During the millennium there will be the King reigning in righteousness -- not merely dominion in righteousness, but securing righteousness by power.<a name=272:5></a> I distinguish between the states of "dwelling" and "reigning.<a name=272:6></a>" The time when God will be all in all will be analogous to that of paradise in its character; the millennial time, to that of Noah's power, though there will be a great deal of the Adamic power brought in.<a name=272:7></a> Noah, if he had been faithful to the power given him, would have had a great deal of the Adam blessing; but he failed entirely, and then failed family discipline.<a name=272:8></a> The character of millennial blessing on earth will be the security of righteousness by power.<a name=272:9></a> But when "God shall be all in all," the new Adamic character of Christ will be displayed over a new creation, and all evil will be done away: "the tabernacle of God shall be with men, and he will dwell with them; and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be their God.<a name=272:10></a>" Therefore on the incarnation the heavenly host sounded, "Peace on earth, goodwill toward [or, in] men.<a name=272:11></a>" But when the Lord Jesus rode into Jerusalem, the word was, "Peace in heaven.<a name=272:12></a>" If Christ takes His place over earth and heaven, there must be peace between God and the people on the earth.<a name=272:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		Then, as to the scriptural phrase "for ever," there are one or two points on which I would speak.<a name=272:14></a> I do not acquiesce in the alteration of that passage in Hebrews 10: "But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God.<a name=272:15></a>" I believe it is right as we have it in some Bibles -- the comma after "for sins," not after "for ever.<a name=272:16></a>" It does not refer to the length of the time that He sits there, but to the fact that Jesus is not as those high priests who stand daily offering the same sacrifices, which can never take away sin, but that He has sat down, as the continuous evidence of the perfection of His sacrifice, that the believer might have always a purged conscience.<a name=272:17></a> This is the force of the passage, and not that He is perpetually in heaven.<a name=272:18></a><a name=273>[Page 273]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I see distinctly, in regard to the saints as to Christ, that they shall reign for ever and ever.<a name=273:1></a> It is not said with Him for ever, but more generally as regards His reigning for ever.<a name=273:2></a> I see distinctly in Daniel 2: 44 the same thing presented as in the passages which have been quoted, namely, the merging of the human character into the divine perpetuity of the kingdom; not looking at the King in relation to the speciality of the kingdom as to the necessity of its continuance, but shewing the blessing of supremacy that belongs to Him as Lord.<a name=273:3></a> In regard to the quotation in Ezekiel, it must be taken in a modified sense, because it is about Israel, a mere question of generations in the land; "your children's children shall dwell in it for ever.<a name=273:4></a>" Now the very elements -- not the earth only, but the elements -- are all to melt.<a name=273:5></a> The kingdom of the Lord God of Israel shall not be destroyed.<a name=273:6></a> They are but witnesses for an appointed time that Jehovah reigns.<a name=273:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will now turn to 1 Corinthians 15.<a name=273:8></a> It does not refer to Messiah's kingdom down here.<a name=273:9></a> The kingdom that is to be given up refers to that spoken of in Psalm 8.<a name=273:10></a> Here is the question of all things being put under man's hand.<a name=273:11></a> When judgment comes, the Father (we read) judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son.<a name=273:12></a> Thus the Son has a sort of independent kingdom.<a name=273:13></a> In the Person of the Lord Jesus God has set man over the works of His hands.<a name=273:14></a> Is this tide in Christ now?<a name=273:15></a> Yes, and the church owns the tide, while the world does not; but if He were to take the power, He must exercise it in righteousness.<a name=273:16></a> In the sense spoken of we own Christ as reigning, but not as sitting on His own throne.<a name=273:17></a> Psalm 109 describes die rejection of the Lord, and His deep humiliation.<a name=273:18></a> In Psalm 110 Jehovah says to the Son, "Sit on my right hand until I make thine enemies thy footstool.<a name=273:19></a>" He shall judge the quick and the dead at His appearing and His kingdom.<a name=273:20></a> His kingdom comes at His appearing.<a name=273:21></a> This is a question between man and God, not the question as to Messiah's kingdom.<a name=273:22></a> Does He deliver up the rule as man when He appears?<a name=273:23></a> Clearly not; but He must reign until His enemies be under His feet, till He has put down all rule and all authority and power.<a name=273:24></a> His enemies are not yet put under Him, though the Father has put all things under His feet in title now.<a name=273:25></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe there will be a testimony of remission of sins preached in the name of Jesus, the instrument of the Holy Ghost to effect a penitence, an Elias ministry that will draw out the hearts of the remnant after Him, something similar to that described in the Song of Solomon; then, when they have looked on Him whom they have pierced, they will mourn because of Him.<a name=274:16></a> Whilst Antichrist rages, they are preserved.<a name=274:17></a> Israel is brought up through the wilderness, and they appoint themselves one head, and great shall be the day of Jezreel.<a name=274:18></a> In this David-reign of Christ He has also to subdue the enemies that are in the land; and after the Assyrian comes up and is destroyed, the indignation is over and will cease.<a name=274:19></a> Thus Christ is associated with Israel and begins to secure the earth, while the gospel of the kingdom goes out to the nations; after this the Son of man sits upon the throne of His glory, and judges the nations according to the manner in which they have treated His messengers.<a name=274:20></a> Messiah having thus established His kingdom, there is peace, and then the heathen know that Jehovah He is God.<a name=274:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the third part of the question, let me say that these words, "differ essentially," must refer to the standing of the saints; for, as to the ground on which any man is a saint, there cannot be any difference.<a name=275:11></a> The development of the character of God does alter in different dispensations, but we know His character can never alter.<a name=275:12></a> For instance, take sanctity: God is known in this character, whether it be among the Jews, or in the church; and two cannot walk together except they are agreed.<a name=275:13></a> Fellowship may not have the same external form, but it must have been the same principle.<a name=275:14></a> The Lord Jesus Christ is "the same yesterday, today, and for ever," and the Spirit of Christ is the same.<a name=275:15></a> This is always the ground on which there is dealing on the conscience.<a name=275:16></a> "If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth.<a name=275:17></a>" The principle is essentially the same, before the flood, after the flood, and at any time.<a name=275:18></a> Holding fast these things is very important.<a name=275:19></a> Certain things that we have learnt from God become necessary principles in all dispensations; but as to the character and form in which they are developed, they are different, save that this great principle is the same.<a name=275:20></a> Sin having come in, there must be grace, and there must be righteousness.<a name=275:21></a>

		As to the difference of the saints' calling, therefore on the earth during the millennium, it will be quite different from that of the saints now on earth, for the obvious reason that the millennial dispensation, as regards the saints on earth, will be a dispensation of judgment.<a name=276:1></a> In one sense it was grace to the Jew, yea, even in paradise.<a name=276:2></a> There can be no dealing with the sinner except in grace; but the Jewish economy is not one of grace, but of the law.<a name=276:3></a> The law is of works, but grace is not.<a name=276:4></a> There never can be departure from the principle on which the soul can stand with God, but the economy of a special time is a different thing.<a name=276:5></a> The economy of the church is judgment within itself.<a name=276:6></a> The church consists of persons separated by internal sanctity from the rest of the world.<a name=276:7></a> Into the church's outward forms a person may enter, but the church is essentially an assembly of separated persons.<a name=276:8></a> The moment it is not, it ceases to be a church.<a name=276:9></a> It consists of those whom God has called out of the world.<a name=276:10></a> In the millennium it will not be so, inasmuch as the Lord Jesus will manifestly govern the world on another principle; until Satan is loosed again, there is no necessary manifestation of who is not of the world, and who is; but the character of the church is quite different.<a name=276:11></a>

		SOME OBSERVATIONS ON THE SCRIPTURE LESSONS OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION

		Sir, <br>If we set his relationship for God apart (and if they on whom the education of the country is made to depend are to be trusted, we want no God, or at least can do better than He), I believe it is a just definition of man that he is a laughing animal; for there are some things, speaking as a man, essentially ridiculous; and this, sir, is one of them.<a name=281:1></a> Of course you know that I mean the so-called scripture lessons of the Board -- the new authorised version of the lovers of education for the instruction of the poor Irish -- a Board that honestly desires to provide the well-being of the conductors of schools.<a name=281:2></a> How kind and considerate!<a name=281:3></a>

		But, sir, this is not all.<a name=281:4></a> Mr.<a name=281:5></a> Carlile, I suppose, knows Hebrew, and this is a translation.<a name=281:6></a> Nothing else would answer the purpose -- "meet the exigency of the case" -- cut the Gordian knot that tied the destinies of just education, but that some one should sit down and make a new translation of the Bible, or at least such parts of it as were fit to be translated; and here it is with notes, critical, explanatory, and practical.<a name=281:7></a> I trust, sir, you will give due publicity to this important fact, for the benefit of others as well as the poor Irish children, that the translator knows Hebrew.<a name=281:8></a> He does know what Eden means, and he does not exactly know what Shaphan means; but, for the purpose of making it more clearly intelligible to the rising generation, he proposed to call it Shaphan; neither Coney nor Ischin, nor Daman -- Israel, which it is called when the unknown animal is known, answering the purpose at least for Irish children: so we have given the original Hebrew.<a name=281:9></a>

		As for Eden, very intelligible it would be to say, The children of pleasure which were in Thelassar; or Hasan, or Camah, and pleasure, the merchants of Sheba, and, or planted a garden in pleasure.<a name=281:10></a> However, the translator says it may be rendered either as a proper name, or as an epithet.<a name=281:11></a> And the translator knows Hebrew -- knows Hebrew!<a name=281:12></a> knows enough of that, and everything else too, to set at rest all the difficult questions which have hindered Irish education time out of mind, and give just the quantum of scripture which will satisfy Papists and Protestants, Presbyterians, Arians and Socinians, and above all himself (God, sir, we must remember, is put out of question), with just the right sense and nobody to dispute it.<a name=281:13></a> O happy ages, that we should have one such man!<a name=281:14></a> Nothing wanted and nothing too much -- a little bit of David's piety, and that, of course, rightly applied and understood; and a little bit of his own, which others may apply and understand as they like -- a little of St.<a name=281:15></a> Paul's commentary with his to explain it; and a little bit of his own without anybody to explain it at all; and those who shall not worship the golden image, set up, as it is, by these monarchs of education, with the trumpet of their own unanimous recommendation!<a name=281:16></a> A golden head of wickedness they are.<a name=281:17></a> Happy age!<a name=281:18></a> that we should have one such man to be the common instrument of so noble an oligarchy in enlightening the happy children of this once unhappy land; that Sabellians, and Papists, and Socinians, and doctors, should find one to make a new translation of the scriptures of God, which should satisfy them all, and enlighten the Irish in Hebrew, and the world as to his attainments.<a name=281:19></a> How interesting to see the poor little Irish children considering what Zaphnath-paaneah meant in the Egyptian language upon the authority of St.<a name=281:20></a> Jerome, and comparing it with what others think, and the habits of the Chinese language; or studying the distinction between doctors and Heliopolis without knowing what others think at all!<a name=281:21></a> But then indeed the translator knows all this, though what all this is is hard to tell.<a name=281:22></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#283:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>It were easy to shew the baseness -- infidelity is always base -- of the cringing fawning language of this preface on the worst pride of evil; how while everything has been done to please Popery in the work (and they were right in giving up all thoughts of pleasing Protestants. They gave up that when they gave up the scriptures), the scriptures with them must be *aut Caesar aut nullus*, for they fear God; yes, the opposition of the priests -- always wise in their own generation -- has been deprecated, even for this wretched production, with the most servile subserviency. But it was alike unprofitable and unnecessary to degrade the Board lower than it is in the eyes of every good and upright and God-fearing man. It was of more importance to shew the use which Satan proposed to make of this, in doing evil in the country, in the public renunciation by Protestants of the fear of God. For example, the cheerfully leaving to instructors the use of the sacred volume; the not imposing the lessons, but leaving them to the willing adoption of the conductors, whose well-being the Board honestly desires to promote; all this is an ill-concealed profession of leaving everything to the priests, who might themselves, as we know, kick, if anything were done which touched their absolute authority, in spite of the government, while it would blind the feelings of infidels. But, I say, it was of more importance to notice the effect of this, where this subservience was leading us, than merely take notice of the fact, for who could expect to bring a clean thing out of an unclean? The fear of God takes away the fear of man; but infidelity always makes a man a slave of the passions and baseness of others; "he that committeth sin is the servant of sin," and of course must do the work of his master.

		To secure the better acquiescence in the authority of this tract, the translator in the preface tells us that the extracts are a literal translation from the original; but, in the unhappy blindness which often accompanies the desertion of God's word in seeking another object, he has contradicted himself in the same pages: "The translation has been made by a comparison of the Authorised and Douay versions with the original.<a name=298:1></a>" Now every one knows, sir, that the Douay is not, and does not profess to be made from the original at all, but from the Vulgate; and, truly, forming a text by the comparison of this and another translation with the original is not translating at all, certainly not literally from the original.<a name=298:2></a> And there are passages taken from the Douay, and important ones too, where is little or no authority for positive variations from the original save that of the Vulgate itself.<a name=298:3></a> It may be very well to set upon the front of the statement that it is a literal translation of the original.<a name=298:4></a> It was thus Mr.<a name=298:5></a> Belsham exerted himself.<a name=298:6></a> But it is too bad to find in the same page that it is a comparison of the translation of a translation with another translation which we have after all; and that, in fact, this authority is knuckled to in many instances.<a name=298:7></a> Will anybody believe that planting a garden from "the beginning" in Eden was introduced instead of eastward,<a href="#298:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> because it was more literal?<a name=298:8></a> In "Eden" he was forced to retain the authorised translation for sense's sake, though the Douay and Vulgate translate it otherwise; but then he was to give no advantage to either side: so Mikkedem must be translated "from the beginning," though he confesses the Hebrew word has both senses, and the place is confessedly to the eastward.<a name=298:9></a> But he was not satisfied with putting "in Eden," but he must assert the integrity of the Douay, "pleasure," in a note, the assertion of which would make nonsense of this and other places if "translated literally," and which is directly negatived by the point as far as they go.<a name=298:10></a> But this, sir, is comparatively an immaterial instance, save as to the wickedness of unsettling all the certainty of scripture in the minds of man.<a name=298:11></a>

		Sir, <br>I address you thus formally in a public document in which it is my object, not to express any personal feelings, but to investigate principles.<a name=306:1></a> Your language (as reported) has given me occasion to address you on the subject on which I write: a matter which I confess has occasioned some astonishment to my mind, though other principles than astonishment bring it into action.<a name=306:2></a> The character of the public meeting held in this city on the subject of the anti-scriptural system of education needs no comment at present.<a name=306:3></a> You were present at that meeting and spoke; but it is not my object to discuss the character of your speech.<a name=306:4></a> The unholy marriage between Infidelity and Popery -- the devil's apostate counterpart of the union between the bride the Lamb's wife and the great head of the church -- whose banns have been first published in this unhappy country, if not adequately exposed (as I think none can feel its evil sufficiently), has yet given occasion to so loud an expression of principle as I trust will, under God, give stability to those who might otherwise have been entangled, and maintain the public expression of the right, here at least, before God, when all principle and allegiance towards Him have been so atrociously invaded.<a name=306:5></a> But you were following in your opposition in the rear of those to whom you owed canonical obedience.<a name=306:6></a> It was at least, sir, an unfriendly way of doing it.<a name=306:7></a>

		I shall extract, pretty much at length, the statements of Dr.<a name=308:1></a> Whately on this subject in the article on the word person, in the appendix to his Logic, "Ambiguous Terms.<a name=308:2></a>" "Person, in its most ordinary use, always implies a numerically distinct substance; each man is one person, and can be but one.<a name=308:3></a> It, besides a peculiar theological sense, is more closely connected with its etymology.<a name=308:4></a> It is well known that the Latin word <i>persona</i> signified originally a mask which actors wore on the stage; each of which being painted in each instance suitably to the character to be represented, and worn by every one who acted the part, the word came to signify the character itself which the actor played; and afterwards any character, proper or assumed, which any one sustained; as for example in a passage of Cicero (De Oratore) where he is describing the process by which he composed his pleadings, by imagining himself in the place of his opponent and of the judge, as well as his own.<a name=308:5></a> '<i>Tres personas unus suscipio, summa animi aequitate: meam adversam, judicis</i>.<a name=308:6></a>' We should render this by saying, 'I assume these three characters,' or 'I place myself in these three situations.<a name=308:7></a>' The further transition, by which <i>persona</i>, and, as Anglicised by us, person came to signify commonly a distinct being, is very natural, though I believe it never took place while the purity of the Latin idiom lasted.<a name=308:8></a> <i>Persona</i>, in some sense, not far remote, it may be supposed, from its classical signification, was adopted by theologians to distinguish the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, in the blessed Trinity, so as to imply the strict and proper unity of the divine Being, Who is all and each of these: and the word person was employed by our divines as a literal, or rather perhaps an etymological, translation of the Latin word <i>persona</i>.<a name=308:9></a> In this sense, its difference from person, as employed in ordinary discourse (in which, however, it seems to have been much less common at the time when our liturgy, etc.<a name=308:10></a>, were framed, than in the present day), is of the highest importance: since it is evident that 'three divine persons,' in the ordinary meaning of the word, is precisely equivalent to 'three Gods.<a name=308:11></a>'"

		Again -- "In this, our church, very wisely and scripturally, sets before us the relations in which the Most High stands towards us of Maker, Redeemer, and Sanctifier: thus adhering to the apparent design of Holy Writ," etc.<a name=308:12></a> "The same consideration has induced me to insert in the present edition some extracts from the theological works (less known than they deserve) of the celebrated Dr.<a name=308:13></a> Wallis's, the mathematician and logician, who appears to have been the church's most powerful champion against the Arians and Socinians of his day.<a name=308:14></a> Not that I wish implicit deference to be paid to any human authority, however eminent: but it may be worth while to correct the notion, if any shall have entertained it, that the views of the subject here taken are, in our church, novelties.<a name=308:15></a> That which makes these expressions (namely, those respecting the Trinity) seem harsh to some of these men, is because they have used themselves to fancy that notion only of the word person, according to which three men are accounted to be three persons, and these three persons to be three men.<a name=308:16></a> But he may consider that there is another notion of the word person, and in common use too, wherein the same man may be said to sustain divers persons, and three persons to be the same man; that is, the same man as sustaining divers capacities.<a name=308:17></a> As was said but now of Tully, <i>tres personas unus sustineo</i>.<a name=308:18></a> And then it will seem no more harsh to say, the three persons, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are one God, than to say, God the Creator, God the Redeemer, and God the Sanctifier, are one God -- it is much the same thing whether of the two forms we use.<a name=308:19></a>" (Letters on the Trinity, page 63.<a name=308:20></a>)

		I quite agree in the observations advanced by Mr.<a name=316:1></a> Bagot, on the part of all who value, and who can appreciate revelation.<a name=316:2></a> There should be no compromise.<a name=316:3></a> By the Board these extracts are allowed -- religious teachers are allowed -- Protestant and Roman Catholic teachers are allowed; but there is one thing unallowable -- the scriptures.<a name=316:4></a> These are to be removed from the schools.<a name=316:5></a>

		Observe, it is also stated in Mr.<a name=316:6></a> Stanley's letter that, though there was no attempt made to proselytise by Educational Societies, yet there was in them a "vital defect"; because they required the Bible to be used in their schools.<a name=316:7></a> It was then not any unavowed use of the opportunities which these schools afforded which formed the ground of objection to them -- any attempt to proselytise.<a name=316:8></a> This is professedly disclaimed by Mr.<a name=316:9></a> Stanley's letter.<a name=316:10></a> He declares there was no such attempt made.<a name=316:11></a> It was solely, singly, and simply the use of the scriptures.<a name=316:12></a> This was the "vital defect.<a name=316:13></a>" This statement of Mr.<a name=316:14></a> Stanley's puts in the strongest light the discharging the schools from all other offence than the real point that they had -- the scriptures.<a name=316:15></a> This, and this alone, was the thing which made the other schools necessary; in order to the exclusion of these they are professedly set up.<a name=316:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another point in Mr.<a name=316:17></a> Stanley's letter: he states that the strenuous exertions of the priests were directed against these scripture schools.<a name=316:18></a> Now, this shews distinctly that the objection to the attendance of children at schools, where the Bible was taught, was not on the part of their parents, but on the part of priests.<a name=316:19></a> From whence arose the necessity of these strenuous exertions on the part of the priests, but because, that without them the children would have been sent, and that it required them all to keep the parents from so sending their children?<a name=316:20></a> And it is further evident, because in spite of the priests, large numbers of Roman Catholics attended scripture schools.<a name=316:21></a> I think there were not less than 133,000 children attending the one class of schools in which the scriptures were read, and from which the government grant was taken away, at the time the Education Commission inquiry was appointed.<a name=316:22></a> At that time the priests were exceedingly active to diminish the numbers; but, notwithstanding all their exertions, there remained about 100,000 children in those schools.<a name=316:23></a> It need hardly be said that the thirty-odd thousand which were removed were Roman Catholics.<a name=316:24></a> But it appeared from the report of the Commissioners, founded on the returns of both persuasions, that the majority of these 100,000 which remained were Roman Catholics, shewing the very great predominance of Roman Catholic children attending the scriptural schools, in spite of the exertions of the priests, which Mr.<a name=316:25></a> Stanley affirmed to be so unceasingly used.<a name=316:26></a> And thus we find, that the scriptures were not objected to by Roman Catholics, but that they were unpalatable to the priests.<a name=316:27></a>

		I believe the principle upon which this Board is founded is infidelity.<a name=317:1></a> I believe it to be the grand expression and instrument, in this country, of that infidelity which is making such rapid strides.<a name=317:2></a> This Board professes to give a translation from the original.<a name=317:3></a> But what has it done?<a name=317:4></a> It has completely removed from the mind any resting-place at all.<a name=317:5></a> It gives us a few extracts as a substitute for the entire word of God, and which we are to believe will answer every purpose.<a name=317:6></a> By giving us a new translation, it discredits those which exist as unworthy of all credit -- that it would be improper to put them into the hands of children; and it dissociates the minds of children from their phraseology, so as just to make them used to neither of them as the accredited testimony of God.<a name=317:7></a> It depreciates not only the authorised version, but also, with all its faults, the Douay version.<a name=317:8></a> But let the Roman Catholic read the Douay version.<a name=317:9></a> With all its defects, he will learn there all the fundamental truths of Christianity; and what is more, if he take the trouble to compare it with the authorised version, he will discover a real similarity -- he will discover that the one is so like the other, as to be convinced that the authorised version is the word of God.<a name=317:10></a> But those extracts are not like either -- and yet, the scriptures are taken away -- the ordinary translations discredited -- and none whatever given in their room, but a set of extracts afforded, which equally reflect on the authorised and the Douay:, so that when the child, in after days, should turn to them, he will find, what from his early days he has learned is no authentic testimony to the truth.<a name=317:11></a> This is the great effort of infidelity, to sweep away from man the only warrant he has for faith and practice -- the word of the living God -- to give up the profitable study of which we are to be supplied with extracts which give no instruction on subjects doctrinal or practical; and yet we are informed in the preface, "that these extracts have been compiled in the hope of their leading to a more general and more profitable perusal of the word of God.<a name=317:12></a>"

		I beg your attention to this further point: we have seen it stated that these extracts have been compiled in the hope of their leading to a more general and more profitable perusal of the word of God; and yet, a little lower down, we read, "that no passage has either been introduced or omitted under the influence of any peculiar view of Christianity, doctrinal or practical.<a name=318:1></a>" The only authority for doctrine or practice is God's word; but in extracts information on neither is to be had.<a name=318:2></a> There we can ascertain no views of Christianity.<a name=318:3></a> And yet they were "compiled to lead us to the more profitable perusal of God's word.<a name=318:4></a>" That is, while the word of God is taken away from the children in its own simplicity and fulness, with the aid of extracts (which cast contempt on our translation, and the Douay) we learn that we profitably peruse the word of God, when we deduce no views from it either doctrinal or practical!<a name=318:5></a>

		DELIVERANCE FROM THE LAW OF SIN
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When I finished my tract on the "Sealing of the Spirit," I intimated that I thought of taking up some detail as to deliverance.<a name=323:1></a> Other occupations and want of strength combined to hinder me.<a name=323:2></a> But intercourse with others, and some passages of scripture, have re-aroused the desire to dwell a little on some points which present difficulty, even where in theory all is plain, and especially the want of deliverance from the law of sin where liberty with God is known.<a name=323:3></a> It is very evident that deliverance from the law of sin and death ought not, indeed cannot, remain in theory.<a name=323:4></a> Yet we find those who avow they are sealed, and have the consciousness of the effect of the Spirit's dwelling in them, are not delivered from that law of evil which works in the flesh.<a name=323:5></a> That conflict will remain to the end, though perhaps in a more subtle form, is certain.<a name=323:6></a> "If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.<a name=323:7></a>" We deceive ourselves; the truth, in the inward effect of its presence on our conscious state, has not produced its effect.<a name=323:8></a> Where the truth of Christ is in the heart, there is the consciousness that there is that which is not Christ.<a name=323:9></a> Where this is not so, the conscience has not been so wrought on as to give in the new man begotten by the word the sense of that which is contrary to Christ, who is the life of the new man, the spring of its sensibilities and moral feelings.<a name=323:10></a> Where this has been wrought in us, it gives its own consciousness of anything and everything that is contrary to it.<a name=323:11></a> There is no need of yielding to it, for Christ's grace is sufficient for us, and His strength is made perfect in weakness; but the being out of its power supposes the power of Christ, and diligence in looking to Him, that we may have that power to use, "always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our body.<a name=323:12></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But let us weigh the effect of the sealing with the Spirit.<a name=323:13></a> Scripture is plain that it is consequent on faith in redemption, as His coming is the consequence of the accomplishment of redemption.<a name=323:14></a> Acts 2: 38 gives us the plain declaration that it is in having part in the forgiveness of sins that the Holy Ghost is given.<a name=323:15></a> (So Ephesians 1: 13.<a name=323:16></a>) Hence liberty is there at once for the forgiven soul.<a name=323:17></a> It has remission of its sins, is conscious of it, and is before God, with a purged conscience, in peace.<a name=323:18></a> Romans 5 is the expression of this -- the general normal state of a redeemed soul.<a name=323:19></a> It enjoys that favour which is better than life.<a name=323:20></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there are two things consequent on this, connected more immediately with deliverance -- our new relationships, and power over sin in the flesh.<a name=324:1></a> The presence of the Holy Ghost is the power of the new relationship and liberty with God, but there was a work done by Christ to bring us into it -- His dying unto sin once, and our having died with Him, that we may be free, and wholly, for faith in this new relationship.<a name=324:2></a> Now there may be faith in the efficacy of that work of Christ; that He has set us in the place where redemption brings us, and in favour under grace, and delivered us from the responsibility of making out righteousness to meet God, without that experimental acquaintance with what we are delivered from, which results through grace in deliverance, in practical reality, in the conscious state of the soul.<a name=324:3></a> This is not mere forgiveness and justification from guilt.<a name=324:4></a> That applies to the old standing in the flesh, and to its works.<a name=324:5></a> That is needed for the possession of the Spirit and deliverance, but is not its fruit and consequence; it is the clearing away the guilt of the old man, not the position of the new.<a name=324:6></a> But there is a more general aspect of redemption, in which it exists in the minds of many, in which it mixes itself up with the new.<a name=324:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We read, "In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace.<a name=324:8></a>" Now this, where there is no definite apprehension of truth as to the sealing of the Spirit, leads the mind into the feelings and peace which the sealing of the Spirit gives the definite consciousness of, in our relationship with the Father and the Son.<a name=324:9></a> I do not doubt that many sealed ones remain in this true but indefinite sense of grace, and count on divine love; for you have more than forgiveness, you have the riches of His grace, and you have redemption through His blood -- not merely forgiveness -- a rescue from a state you were in, and introduction into eternal blessings.<a name=324:10></a> But it is not, after all, conscious sonship, and being consciously in Christ, and Christ in us.<a name=324:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having noticed and guarded these collateral questions, I turn to the direct point which is connected with the failure in practical deliverance from the law of sin which is in our members -- namely, the state of a soul which enjoys the liberty of its new position in grace, but does not find power against evil as it would wish.<a name=324:12></a> Now, we have already noticed that there are the two things: the presence of the Holy Ghost, by which we know we are under grace, and enjoy the relationships into which we are brought -- the Spirit of adoption, and that work by which the deliverance has been wrought; not forgiveness, or the blessed Lord's dying for our sins, but His dying to sin, and rising again.<a name=324:13></a> This last was closing all association with the first Adam place, and law, its rule from God, which could bind no longer than a man lived and the entering into a new place and standing with God, based on redemption and divine righteousness.<a name=324:14></a> The place is now according to the riches of God's grace, and past all that separated us from God, accomplished for us on the cross, and according to this place in sonship through redemption -- "My Father, and your Father; my God, and your God.<a name=324:15></a>" The Holy Ghost gives us the consciousness, shedding withal abroad in our hearts the love of God.<a name=324:16></a> Blessed be His name, we are in Christ before God, and we know it.<a name=324:17></a>

		But then Christ is in us.<a name=325:1></a> But it is not difficult to understand that the soul which, through grace, has believed in redemption and the grace that gave it, should know and have the consciousness of this acceptance.<a name=325:2></a> This depends on our being in Christ, and this known by the Spirit; it is objective, our standing in faith; and the new man acquainted with redemption cannot but know its place in Christ, though it may be little realised.<a name=325:3></a> But when I speak of Christ in me, it applies to my actual state -- is subjective.<a name=325:4></a> "If Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin.<a name=325:5></a>" Now I fully admit that we are brought into this place by Christ's work.<a name=325:6></a> Still, the state of the soul is connected with it, not simply relationship.<a name=325:7></a> With whom does death put us in relationship?<a name=325:8></a> It puts us out of relationship with all a living man is connected with -- sin, the world, and all in it; and that is a very great thing indeed, but it is what has happened to us if Christ is in us.<a name=325:9></a> Of this more in a moment.<a name=325:10></a> But if knowing that I am in Christ, and Christ in me, I look up.<a name=325:11></a> Is there any flaw, or something wanting to my position?<a name=325:12></a> Why, Christ (and I am in Him) is the very object and perfection of God's delight; I lack nothing; acceptable according to God Himself, I have nothing unacceptable to what He is.<a name=325:13></a> I may realise it more or less, but what I realise is perfection itself.<a name=325:14></a> But Christ is in me -- I look <i>down</i>.<a name=325:15></a> Is all perfect, nothing wanting here?<a name=325:16></a> Not in Him abstractedly; but if I am true, earnest, loving holiness, loving Christ, I find what displeases me, how much more God!<a name=325:17></a> No excuse, for Christ is power as well as life; but all is not what I would have it to be, even according to the light I have.<a name=325:18></a>

		The Christian's responsibility is here to walk as Christ walked, to manifest the life of Jesus in his mortal flesh.<a name=326:1></a> Without Christ he can do nothing, and diligence, a heart exercised in dependence, prayer, the word, watchfulness -- all have their place; exercising oneself day and night to have a conscience void of offence towards God and towards man, not grieving the Holy Spirit of promise by which we are sealed, so that He be not a rebuker, but the spring of joy in that which is heavenly.<a name=326:2></a> It is not now a question of righteousness or imputation.<a name=326:3></a> As to that, Christ has borne our sins, and we are in Him, according to His acceptance before God.<a name=326:4></a> The question is now brought into one of holiness, of acceptableness, not acceptance; and with a true heart this is of the utmost moment.<a name=326:5></a> For though God's sovereign grace has found a way in the unspeakable gift of Jesus on the cross, of meeting our sins according to His glory, so that grace should reign through righteousness, and guilt be no longer in question, yet what is really acceptable to Him is the basis of this very judicial estimate, and as partakers of the divine nature, His judgment is ours.<a name=326:6></a>

		Into the detail of this I do not enter: it has been treated of elsewhere; it is in principle always law, the thought of God's judgment of us depending on our state.<a name=326:14></a> This is not -- in its grosser form -- guilt; for that is through sins committed; but being lost through what we are, perhaps a terrible question of self-deception, if we have made profession.<a name=326:15></a> We may writhe under the cords that bind us, and rub ourselves sore, but the cords are not broken, but a most useful lesson has been learned -- what we are, and that we have no strength.<a name=326:16></a> And now comes deliverance, through the working and power of the Holy Ghost, but in the faith of what the blessed Lord has wrought.<a name=326:17></a> He has not only borne our sins, redeemed us, and cleared us from guilt, but He died unto sin.<a name=326:18></a> The full result will be the new heavens and the new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness, but the work itself is done.<a name=326:19></a> He appeared once in the end of the world to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself.<a name=326:20></a> See Hebrews 9: 26, and what follows as to our sins: and John 1: 29.<a name=326:21></a> Now thus as a sacrifice to put away sin, we find its practical application in Romans 8: 3.<a name=326:22></a> When Christ was for sin, that is, a sacrifice for sin, God condemned sin in the flesh, not that Christ surely had any, but that He was made sin for us, Him who knew no sin, and died to it on the cross.<a name=326:23></a> I have part in the efficacy of His cross, and this hateful sin in the flesh, condemnable in me and everywhere, has been condemned there, condemned in Christ's death.<a name=326:24></a> He died unto sin once; and while the condemnation is accomplished, and most solemnly and fully for me, in that blessed One, who was made sin for me in grace, it was so in death, so that, as done effectually for me, there is no condemnation, but I reckon myself dead.<a name=326:25></a> I have been crucified with Christ, my old man is crucified with Him.<a name=326:26></a> We are not actually dead, of course; but faith, according to the word, appropriates this truth.<a name=326:27></a>

		As to our life, the old things are passed, and Christ is our life, we having with Him died to sin, and now alive to God with Him (my whole spiritual condition, in connection with sin in the flesh, having closed by death); and this is so perfect, that we could, if God's time were come, go, and be as the thief Christ's companion in paradise.<a name=329:1></a> But generally we are left here and have to do with the old man -- the flesh; free, redeemed out of the state and standing we were in, but having to do with the existence of flesh in us, with Satan and the world around.<a name=329:2></a> It is with the first I have to do now.<a name=329:3></a> Now in this state of things, that is, in a believer sealed with the Spirit, the conscious relationship is with God as sons, and true liberty is there.<a name=329:4></a> But there is more: when we have learned what it is to have died with Christ, the soul is set "free from the law of sin and death.<a name=329:5></a>" He that is dead is justified from sin -- not sins.<a name=329:6></a> You cannot accuse a dead man of a perverse will or evil lusts.<a name=329:7></a> But the flesh is in me.<a name=329:8></a> Now, captive to the law of sin in my members is not the place of conflict nor of victory, any more than Israel had to fight in Egypt.<a name=329:9></a> There may be carelessness as regards our communion with the Father and with His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord; but this is only deadness of soul, and the power of present things, the want of spiritual feeling.<a name=329:10></a> But if we do not mortify the deeds of the body, there is a positive evil power at work, positive evil rises up; if there be conscience, the sense of a bad state is there, and a worse one if there be not -- the spiritual judgment is deteriorated.<a name=329:11></a> The flesh has a power which does not answer to deliverance, and we see persons who have not lost the sense of their standing with God, and are in that sense at liberty, in whom the flesh works as if spiritual power in Christ were not there.<a name=329:12></a>

		But it is of all moment to see that deliverance in the sense of known relationship with God, our place in Christ, not in Adam or in flesh, is a distinct thing from deliverance in the sense of the realisation of death and resurrection with Christ.<a name=331:8></a> This is the basis of that, known by the presence and power of the Holy Ghost.<a name=331:9></a> But one is the place we are in, the other the experimental power of walking according to that place, and, as the flesh is in us, requiring diligence of heart in seeking grace and strength (for without Christ we can do nothing), seeking Him, and the things which are above, where He is seated, and bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus.<a name=331:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But it is of all moment that we recognise deliverance from the law of sin as the Christian state.<a name=331:11></a> Here only is power, the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus, the power of the Spirit of God working in the life of Christ.<a name=331:12></a> There is true liberty, and that based on Christ's dying to sin once, and for sin; Romans 6 and 8.<a name=331:13></a> There is, for such, a grace sufficient for us, and strength made perfect in weakness; so that there is no excuse for the commission of sin, though the flesh be in us.<a name=331:14></a> And here spiritual exercises have their place, to the acquisition of heavenly things in spirit, and a heavenly character down here.<a name=331:15></a> It is evident that the grace and strength of Christ only can enable us to walk in the path in which He walked, but that grace is sufficient for us.<a name=331:16></a> But His strength -- it is its nature and character -- is made perfect in weakness; and there must be known weakness in us to find this strength.<a name=331:17></a> Hence those exercises of heart before deliverance, in which we learn our weakness, that we cannot get the victory (even when we desire it), which lead to the felt need of deliverance.<a name=331:18></a> This we find in the death of Christ, and are thus free -- "free from the law of sin and death.<a name=331:19></a>" Consequent on this there is victory, and, if kept in the sense that we have no strength in ourselves, the peaceful though watchful consciousness that He is with us, as well as that without Him we can do nothing.<a name=331:20></a> Deliverance is His dying to sin once, and we in Him, and, while thus free, having the strength in Him which is made perfect in weakness in us.<a name=331:21></a> Till we have learned that we cannot free ourselves, we do not get freedom.<a name=331:22></a> Freedom is the portion of every Christian so taught of God; strength, of him who abides in the sense that he has none, and looks to Christ; only there are the Lord's gracious dealings with us to keep us in this position.<a name=331:23></a>

		FOUR THINGS WE HAVE IN CHRIST
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is very striking to notice, when the eye is opened to see it, how the manner of Paul's conversion brought out to his soul the entire contrast of all that was in man, and what was in Christ.<a name=337:1></a> Every principle on which man could rest was gone; conscience had failed to be a guide.<a name=337:2></a> Paul thought he ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth, so that his conscience led him, making him destroy Christ if he could; his righteousness, according to the law, wrought to the same thing.<a name=337:3></a> He could not have Christ, he was a Pharisee; his religiousness too made him bow to the authority of the chief priests.<a name=337:4></a> By conscience, law, and religiousness, he was against God.<a name=337:5></a> All the things which could act religiously upon the senses, which God had Himself appointed, and had been present Himself upon the earth to maintain, all had brought man to enmity against God.<a name=337:6></a> Paul had lived in it all, and found himself thereby only in activity against God.<a name=337:7></a> His religion as to the flesh was all smashed; it all went for nothing: of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews, as touching the law, a blameless Pharisee -- all was gone!<a name=337:8></a> It had brought him into enmity against the Lord of glory.<a name=337:9></a> And, let me say here, that ritualism, by which in these days people are seeking to build up all this again, is the <i>denial</i> of Christ; before He came and wrought redemption it was only <i>ignorance</i> of Him.<a name=337:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When Paul by grace got hold, not of external morality, as to which he was blameless, but of the spirituality of the law, he found that by the law was the knowledge of sin.<a name=337:11></a> Very useful it now is in that way; but you cannot build up service to God upon that whose only true effect is to convict of sin, nor on the flesh that is not subject to God but is enmity against Him; that is quite clear.<a name=337:12></a> It is of the greatest moment for our understanding God's ways, and for our having peace, that we should clearly see this.<a name=337:13></a> God bore with Judaising tendencies till Jerusalem was destroyed; but in Paul, for his deliverance, it was all smashed up at once.<a name=337:14></a> Blind outwardly, and his eye turned in, he found everything in him was enmity against God.<a name=337:15></a> He had been brought up in, what would be called in these days, a famous university; but now, instead of himself, he had got Christ, and all the rest was judged by this revelation of Christ.<a name=337:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the philosophical wisdom of man is no better.<a name=337:17></a> It is never true, nor can it arrive at any true knowledge of God or of man.<a name=337:18></a> It is false in its basis.<a name=337:19></a> As legalism takes up sinful flesh to make out righteousness, so rationalism takes up man's mind to know God, of which it is so incapable that what it is capable of cannot be God; for it must be master of the subject to know it rightly, which it cannot be of God.<a name=337:20></a> A God that reason is equal to is not God at all.<a name=337:21></a> God has chosen the foolish things, a gibbet, to glorify Himself by, so that no flesh should glory in His presence.<a name=337:22></a> What is all the wisdom of this world?<a name=337:23></a> Only that in which the flesh clothes itself.<a name=337:24></a> A conscience dealt with by God alone puts God in His place and ourselves in ours; the moment I get the moral system of the world, I find what is not of the Father, and it is all judged.<a name=337:25></a> Paul started there, with human righteousness and religious standing with God, razed to its foundations; all the more powerful as a testimony, that he was a blameless man personally.<a name=337:26></a> But our whole position is changed from that of being in the flesh ("Of God are we in Christ Jesus"); we do not want a system that builds it up in ceremonial righteousness or rationalistic pretensions, for we are <i>of God</i>.<a name=337:27></a>

		The Greeks were spinning thoughts out of their own heads, which, like spiders' webs, could catch flies and nothing else.<a name=338:1></a> Some said: God was too high to notice man.<a name=338:2></a> It sounded very grand, but then what was to become of man?<a name=338:3></a> Some would exalt man to an equality with God; Epicureanism and Stoicism are of all ages.<a name=338:4></a> God puts man in his place as a responsible person, not a reasoner.<a name=338:5></a> The world by wisdom knew not God.<a name=338:6></a> Why did the Athenians set up an altar to the "unknown God"?<a name=338:7></a> It was the only bit of truth Paul could pick up to use among them.<a name=338:8></a>

		God chose all the foolish things, the weak things, to put down what was wise and strong in man's sight -- a parcel of fishermen; and to Paul he gave the thorn in the flesh, lest he should think it was by his own power the work was done.<a name=338:9></a> Nothing has gone over the world like Christianity.<a name=338:10></a> Even the unconverted have felt its effect: people do not do in the light what they do in the dark.<a name=338:11></a> So it has had an effect where there is no conversion.<a name=338:12></a>

		Half a century ago a sentence of Cicero's shewed me there could be no knowledge of God by reason.<a name=339:1></a> The words are these: "<i>Quocirca huic, quasi materia quam tractet et in qua versetur subiecta est veritas</i>.<a name=339:2></a>" (<i>De Officiis</i> I .<a name=339:3></a> verse 16 ed.<a name=339:4></a> Orell.<a name=339:5></a> iv.<a name=339:6></a> 317.<a name=339:7></a>) That could not be God.<a name=339:8></a> I saw that faith only could put God in His place, and me in mine; not an attempt to satisfy God as Judge, with what sinful flesh can do, quieting our conscience for a time with what never purges it.<a name=339:9></a> "We are of God.<a name=339:10></a>" But another truth connects itself with this, through what the law did do in the conscience: "I, through the law, am dead to the law.<a name=339:11></a>" But, if only killed and condemned, that would not do of course; so he adds, "I am crucified with Christ.<a name=339:12></a>" He found Christ had taken the curse which the law pronounced, and death to sin was ours through Him, and Christ was living in him: "Not I, but Christ liveth in me.<a name=339:13></a>" Then there is also the object of this life by which it lives: "The Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.<a name=339:14></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But that we are of God thus is only one side; what we are ourselves of God in Christ Jesus.<a name=339:15></a> Besides that, we get what Christ is for us on the part of God.<a name=339:16></a> We are of God in Christ, a completely new thing; and He is "made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption.<a name=339:17></a>" We have all these things of and from God now.<a name=339:18></a> The passage gives us the character and quality of the things as <i>of</i> and <i>from</i> God.<a name=339:19></a> It is not righteousness, nor is it sanctification according to the law.<a name=339:20></a> In Philippians Paul (for he does not here contrast it with sins) says: "not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is of <i>God</i>" -- another kind.<a name=339:21></a> He had given up all thoughts of righteousness as a man; he was not ashamed of the gospel, for therein was the righteousness of God revealed.<a name=339:22></a> There are fruits of righteousness, of course, but this is entirely of grace.<a name=339:23></a>

		We have these four things: wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, redemption (there are many more, fellowship with the Father and the like); but we get these four things as the basis of all.<a name=339:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not of man.<a name=339:25></a> Christ is divine "wisdom" for us: God has made foolish the wisdom of this world, but "we speak wisdom among them that are perfect.<a name=339:26></a>" He has "abounded towards us in all wisdom and prudence, having made known unto us the mystery of his will.<a name=339:27></a>" (See Ephesians 1: 8-10.<a name=339:28></a>) The divine revelation of all God's thoughts and intentions is in Christ; "the wisdom of God in a mystery," which word means what only the initiated understand: as in Freemasonry, I do not know anything about it because I am not initiated.<a name=339:29></a>

		God's delight was with the sons of men, before the foundation of the world; Proverbs 8.<a name=340:1></a> Angels were there already when the world was created, but they were not the objects of God's delight and purpose; they were the testimony that God could make a glorious creature and keep him.<a name=340:2></a> But we are the testimony that He can make an inferior creature, and, when he has fallen into sin, He can redeem him.<a name=340:3></a> All the display of what God is in redemption is unfolded in and through man.<a name=340:4></a> We are lower than the angels as creatures; so Christ became lower than the angels for the suffering of death.<a name=340:5></a> But all the result of that wondrous dealing of God we get; we have peace with God, redemption through the blood of Christ, "in whom also we have obtained an inheritance.<a name=340:6></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Some have thought that, as Christ is made these things to us, the passage speaks of imputation.<a name=340:7></a> It does not, however.<a name=340:8></a> Imputed wisdom, or imputed redemption, has no sense; other passages do shew that imputation is true in the case of righteousness.<a name=340:9></a> But here the thought is not found; it is, that Christ gives the true character and reality of these things on the part of God.<a name=340:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ is "made wisdom.<a name=340:11></a>" All the mind of God is revealed, which never was till the cross; this mystery, of connecting persons with Him by the power of the Holy Ghost, was never revealed before.<a name=340:12></a> "Who hath saved us and called us .<a name=340:13></a>.<a name=340:14></a>.<a name=340:15></a> according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began, but is now made manifest.<a name=340:16></a>" (2 Timothy 1: 9, 10; also Titus 1: 2, 3.<a name=340:17></a>) The cross having laid the foundation of righteousness which was consistent with God -- and more than consistent, for it glorified Him -- those things are revealed which eye had not seen, nor ear heard.<a name=340:18></a> He gives us spiritual occupation in that way.<a name=340:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then we get "righteousness" -- the righteousness of God revealed on the principle of faith, so that we have no part in its accomplishment at all.<a name=340:20></a> Supposing you kept the law to a tittle, this would be man's righteousness, not God's.<a name=340:21></a> God's righteousness is revealed in His setting Christ at His right hand, as in John 16 the Spirit convinces the world "of righteousness, because I go to my Father.<a name=340:22></a>" Christ having perfectly glorified God, it was due to Him on the part of God, to set Him in the glory, as He says: "He will straightway glorify him," John 13: 31, 32.<a name=340:23></a> "Sit thou at my right hand.<a name=340:24></a>" <i>There</i> was righteousness!<a name=340:25></a> but it was done for us; and, because this work of redemption was done for us, we get the result of it all.<a name=340:26></a> God is "just, and the justifier of him who believeth in Jesus"; not "just and <i>yet</i> the justifier," but just in justifying.<a name=340:27></a>

		And it is a different kind of righteousness in which we stand.<a name=341:1></a> Man's righteousness is the measure of the judgment; but the righteousness of God is the measure of my place before Him.<a name=341:2></a> What a poor sinner needs is that his sins should be met; and, thank God, they are met.<a name=341:3></a> But Christ has done more; He has glorified God.<a name=341:4></a> Where has God's love been manifested?<a name=341:5></a> In the cross.<a name=341:6></a> Supposing He had cut off Adam and Eve, there would have been no love in it, though just.<a name=341:7></a> If He had passed over all sins simply, we should have called it love; it is what man calls mercy; but then it were no matter about righteousness.<a name=341:8></a> But, in Christ dying on the cross, I get all that is in God perfectly glorified; and therefore He puts the Man who did it into the divine glory.<a name=341:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He is "made unto us righteousness.<a name=341:10></a>" It is of faith that it might be by grace.<a name=341:11></a> A man may believe me when I tell him I have paid his debt, but his belief does not add one farthing to the payment.<a name=341:12></a> All the good comes to us, but all the glory comes to Him, and He is worthy of it.<a name=341:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there is "redemption.<a name=341:14></a>" He is "made unto us redemption," which is the full accomplishment, in full deliverance, of all God's plans and counsels as to us; all these are in Christ.<a name=341:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And now we come to sanctification; He is "made unto us sanctification.<a name=341:16></a>" People sometimes say this is imputed; but we have seen that you cannot impute wisdom or redemption, though it may be true as to righteousness.<a name=341:17></a> But Christ is the whole thing.<a name=341:18></a> Whatever wisdom I have is only the wisdom of God in Christ; it is God's wisdom revealed in Christ; so God's righteousness, and so redemption -- He changes our vile bodies.<a name=341:19></a> It is what these things are in Christ Himself in every part.<a name=341:20></a> What is this wisdom?<a name=341:21></a> God's in Christ; He gathers together all things in Him.<a name=341:22></a> What is this righteousness?<a name=341:23></a> Christ.<a name=341:24></a> What redemption?<a name=341:25></a> Christ.<a name=341:26></a> And so with sanctification; Christ still.<a name=341:27></a>

		Philippians 3
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two ways in which we may look at the Christian.<a name=347:1></a> One is according to the counsels and thoughts of God, and the efficacy of the work of the Lord Jesus Christ; "by one offering perfected for ever," accepted in Christ Himself before God, everything that stood against us put away, and the believer cleared completely and for ever from his old condition in Adam, taken out of that old condition, and put into the acceptance of Christ Himself: this is the grace wherein we stand.<a name=347:2></a> But evidently there is also another condition in which the Christian is seen, and that is as walking in this world.<a name=347:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This walk of the Christian we get in two ways -- in the Epistle to the Philippians and in Hebrews.<a name=347:4></a> In Hebrews it is looked at in respect to the grace Christ obtains for us as Priest on high; not the operation of the Spirit <i>in</i> us, but the work of Christ <i>for</i> us, and grace to help in time of need.<a name=347:5></a> But if in Hebrews you see the Christian down here in weakness, needing help and getting it, in Philippians you see him down here, and the energy and power of the Spirit of God working in him.<a name=347:6></a> We have to pass through the world, and there are difficulties in our path, temptations to draw us aside; but one walking in the power of God's Spirit rises above all the difficulties in the midst of which he is.<a name=347:7></a> In Philippians is brought out the power of God's Spirit acting in one walking in the right path, and the result is a person entirely above it all, one who can "rejoice in the Lord alway.<a name=347:8></a>" We may remember, too, that Paul had been four years in prison at the time, two of them with a soldier chained to him; and, what was still more trying, his work as an apostle put a stop to, his activity all come to an end.<a name=347:9></a> He might have reproached himself as to going up to Jerusalem, and so on, but he does not; he rises above it all.<a name=347:10></a> You never hear sin mentioned in this Epistle -- it is never spoken of; nor is the flesh, except as having no confidence in it, in a warning to avoid its religiousness; it is simply a walk in the power of the Spirit.<a name=347:11></a> In the previous chapter you get the graciousness, and in this the energy of the course -- the full energy of the Christian going through this world.<a name=347:12></a> He does not here speak of the cross as that which puts away sin; it has another character here, being looked at practically; here it is being "crucified to the world.<a name=347:13></a>" It is the book of experience, according to the spirit of the Christian on earth.<a name=347:14></a>

		Imprisoned, so that he cannot be active, yet Paul says, It will all turn to my salvation; it will all turn to good: and I can rejoice in the Lord always.<a name=348:1></a> This comes with power when we remember where he was when he could write thus.<a name=348:2></a> He looks back and contrasts his own course with that of those who had made profession but were still going on with the world.<a name=348:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us first look at the character of the energy with which the apostle ran this race.<a name=348:4></a> He says he has not yet attained, is not yet perfect: this is because he is looking at his state.<a name=348:5></a> We must just see what he means by this.<a name=348:6></a> In the first place, he has not a thought of his own righteousness at all.<a name=348:7></a> There was a righteousness which he had had; there was a righteousness which he had boasted in; he had had it, all that which depended on himself: "touching the righteousness which was in the law, blameless.<a name=348:8></a>" But the moment the spiritual character of the law was seen it was all over; all that flesh could trust in was gone for him.<a name=348:9></a> We all know how, when he was in the full flush of his career, the Lord met him, and he discovered that all that had been gain to him; all of which he had boasted, had only served to bring him into open enmity with God.<a name=348:10></a> All this knowledge, all this energy of character, he had only made use of to try to destroy the name of Christ.<a name=348:11></a> It was not a question of his sins; it was that all he had valued as good was gone, his conscience proved to be misdirected, his legal righteousness nothing worth.<a name=348:12></a> There, on his way to Damascus, with authority from the high priest, he found himself in the presence of Christ, and in open enmity with Him; and in that presence all that he was as a religious man, "blameless" -- in the outward sense, of course, for he found himself to be the chief of sinners -- all that Saul could clothe himself with outwardly was utterly smashed, and he himself left to dwell in darkness three days, to go through in his own soul what this terrible revelation had discovered to him.<a name=348:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The practical effect of thus seeing the Christ in glory was to put down in the most powerful way all that was of man.<a name=348:14></a> The first thing we need as sinners, and get through the cross of the Lord Jesus, is "redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins"; but here it was not sins, it was righteousness put away.<a name=348:15></a> What he had stood before God in was all gone; it was brought out in the strongest way in his own experience what man was in his best estate: the upright, honest, law-keeping Pharisee was only enmity against God.<a name=348:16></a> And it was not only that <i>he</i> had failed -- that was not the thing; it was that the whole structure, the moral structure of man, was brought out in the sight of God and done with.<a name=348:17></a> It was the end of the first man; and this not as a doctrine, but practically, for we must learn everything in our own consciences if it is to be a real thing.<a name=348:18></a> It was total, entire, condemnation of man in the flesh in his best form; the best man in the world (best as man goes) was the chief of sinners.<a name=348:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This is a truth that we can learn in different ways, either as seeing ourselves open sinners in rebellion against God, or by discovering that what we esteem best is utterly valueless before Him.<a name=349:1></a> Innocence is gone; man fell from paradise, and that is all over.<a name=349:2></a> There is no going back to the tree of life; and from that time forward man must be either an alien from God, an enemy in his mind by wicked works, or else he must have a heavenly place with God.<a name=349:3></a> On the road to Damascus Saul meets the Man in the glory, and then he is judged in his own conscience, and is found to be an open, ceaseless, enemy of God.<a name=349:4></a> It is easy for us to see that our sins must be judged by God, but we do not see at first that the mind and affections of the flesh are enmity against Him.<a name=349:5></a> But here you see there is an end of Saul, and of everything that the flesh was in this world -- this world that was not paradise, and certainly was not heaven; this world in which the <i>good</i> things were worthless in the sight of God, and certainly the sins were not of any use.<a name=349:6></a>

		Outwardly Saul was the best man possible -- as man goes; conscientious, religious, righteous; and there he was an open enemy against God.<a name=349:7></a> Nothing was to be found here; consequently he looked out of this world and saw Christ in glory; he saw Him there where he stood; and the effect was, the old man was perfectly judged, and there was a new one in heaven.<a name=349:8></a> All that he was was gone.<a name=349:9></a> It is not a question of sins, but of righteousness.<a name=349:10></a> In another place he says, "I had not known sin but by the law.<a name=349:11></a>" But supposing there were a righteousness according to the law, no man had ever reached it except the blessed Lord Himself; but even if Paul <i>could</i> have reached it, he would not have it now, for he says, I have got another; there was "the righteousness of God" for him now.<a name=349:12></a> The law required righteousness from man for God, but this was now all given up; besides, none had attained it.<a name=349:13></a> It is "not having mine own righteousness"; it does not say, not having my own <i>sins</i>.<a name=349:14></a> It goes a great deal farther than that, and I press it on you.<a name=349:15></a> Theoretically it is a man blameless, who says, I will not have it at all.<a name=349:16></a> The whole standing, place, and condition of the first man is a judged thing in his soul; and another Man, Christ in glory, shall be for him that which he was.<a name=349:17></a> The condition of the first man has been shewn out by the revelation of the second Man, and Paul follows Him.<a name=349:18></a> Thus I get the whole ground and standing of legal righteousness swept away.<a name=349:19></a> Nobody had it, of course: still that was altogether the ground he was on; but now, he says, I will not have my own at all, for I have got another.<a name=349:20></a><a name=350>[Page 350]</a>

		The apostle, having considered the purpose of God, now turns to the side of man's responsibility.<a name=363:1></a> That place, as sinners, is death and judgment; where is the Christian as to these?<a name=363:2></a> If I die, he says, I am absent from the body, and present with the Lord.<a name=363:3></a> In dying for us, He has made death, which closed our path in darkness, the way, as with Israel at the Red Sea and Jordan, of getting out of all the ruin here, and the way of getting into blessedness with Christ.<a name=363:4></a> When I take up, not the purpose of God, but that which lies on me in my responsibility as a child of Adam, death becomes a positive gain: I have done with trial, temptation, sin, the world, and I have begun with Christ in heaven: "present with the Lord.<a name=363:5></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		But judgment must be considered also.<a name=363:6></a> We cannot say that is gain, nor that it is ours, as we can of death; but we see here the way it works upon the Christian.<a name=363:7></a> All will be manifest before the judgment-seat of Christ: "That every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.<a name=363:8></a>" We must all give an account of ourselves; nor does the apostle seek to conceal the solemnity of this.<a name=363:9></a> He calls it the terror of the Lord.<a name=363:10></a> But does he tremble?<a name=363:11></a> He does not think of himself in this aspect of it.<a name=363:12></a> The love of Christ constraining him, he persuades other people, the unconverted, who have <i>reason</i> to tremble at the thought of judgment.<a name=363:13></a> This is the effect it has upon Paul; he presses upon others that, if their sins are not gone, they cannot carry them to heaven.<a name=363:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But it has also another effect upon the Christian -- a sanctifying effect upon the conscience: and that is, that we are manifest <i>now</i>, not <i>shall be</i>.<a name=363:15></a> "We are made manifest unto God.<a name=363:16></a>" This is a present thing for the heart and conscience.<a name=363:17></a> The effect of the judgment in this way is most useful; there is no fear as to the result of the judgment, but the sense of that judgment acts in sanctifying power on the heart.<a name=363:18></a> Whilst Christ has put away our sins once and for ever, yet I am manifest to God now; and I am before God estimating things that I do and say as they will be manifest before Him in the day of judgment.<a name=363:19></a> How many things would be judged and done with if we were now before God as we shall be in the day of judgment.<a name=363:20></a>

		These two things are quite distinct: the purpose of God in putting us into the glory of God; and, that He has wrought us for it, and has given us the earnest of the Spirit.<a name=364:1></a> I know that many think it is all presumption in people, their professing to know that they are saved; but it is not presumption to know God's thoughts when He has revealed them.<a name=364:2></a> It is presumption to call in question what God has said.<a name=364:3></a> There is no such thing in the New Testament, after the day of Pentecost, as a Christian being uncertain about his salvation.<a name=364:4></a> Not that there is not exercise in getting into such a place, but there is no such thing as uncertainty as to our standing when in it.<a name=364:5></a> If I see that His blood cleanses from all sin, and that the salvation wrought through that bloodshedding belongs to the believer, it is no good saying, I do not know whether it is for me.<a name=364:6></a> If you believe in that work, God seals you with His Spirit.<a name=364:7></a> If you have got the Holy Ghost, you will know it is yours.<a name=364:8></a> The Lord expressly declares, "at that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.<a name=364:9></a>" Nothing else is owned as the Christian place.<a name=364:10></a> How can I doubt, if the Spirit of God dwelling in me makes me know?<a name=364:11></a> and that Christ has positively declared.<a name=364:12></a> How can I doubt with the earnest of glory and seal in my own heart?<a name=364:13></a> "We have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father," and I know He is my Father.<a name=364:14></a>

		THE NARRATIVE OF PASSION-WEEK, AND OF THE RESURRECTION
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I apprehend that the consideration of the different structure of the days makes the Last Supper and passover quite intelligible.<a name=368:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thursday evening was their Friday.<a name=368:2></a> Thus our Lord ate the passover on Friday, and yet was offered up on Friday.<a name=368:3></a> We know that it was late; for it was night when He was betrayed, just after the supper.<a name=368:4></a> (John 13.<a name=368:5></a>) This was on <i>their</i> Friday night (preceding the day).<a name=368:6></a> The blessed Lamb of God was offered, being crucified the third hour; and the scene closed just after the ninth hour, about three hours within the Friday.<a name=368:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Learned men say between the two evenings means between three and six; but why?<a name=368:8></a> What is their authority?<a name=368:9></a> It is remarkable that the unleavened bread was to begin <i>at even</i> (that is, at 6 o'clock on Thursday, or their Friday), but the paschal lamb to be slain <i>between the two evenings</i>.<a name=368:10></a> Query whether it be not between the beginning of Friday (our Thursday evening) and the beginning of Saturday (our Friday evening)?<a name=368:11></a> It was strictly fulfilled in our Lord; and upon this supposition every statement in the scriptural account is consistent.<a name=368:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The order would then stand thus: --
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Our Thursday evening = their Friday, Last Supper.<a name=368:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Friday = Friday, the Crucifixion.<a name=368:14></a>

		Our Friday evening = their Saturday, the Sabbath.<a name=368:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="paragraph">

		The words "bought" in Mark 16: 1, and "as it was dusk" in Matthew 28: 1, have led me to new apprehensions as to the visits of the women to the sepulchre.<a name=368:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first place, it is to me beyond controversy that several things supposed to happen in the morning really happened on (to us) Saturday evening.<a name=368:21></a> The sabbath closed at 6 in the evening as is known, and from Saturday at 6 in the evening, the women were free to buy their spices or to do anything else.<a name=368:22></a> The Greek for "as it was getting dusk" as in Luke 23: 54, does not mean solely nor properly "dawning.<a name=368:23></a>" Here the Friday evening of our reckoning is "the sabbath drew on," it was the evening of the day that preceded Saturday, the dusk of the commencing Sabbath.<a name=368:24></a>

		Hence, secondly, in Matthew 28: 1, "in the end of the sabbath as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week," is properly what we call Saturday; but this, being sabbath, it was only at the close of it, that is when it was over, that they went.<a name=369:1></a> However, the Greek words for the time differ, and "late" in Matthew 28: 1 is not the same as "<i>hespera</i>" used for "evening" in Luke 24: 29.<a name=369:2></a> The former <i>(opse)</i> means "after," and even "a good while after.<a name=369:3></a>" See Wetstein on Matthew 28: I; but it is given as "late.<a name=369:4></a>" We learn also from Marsh (whose reasonings on the passage are unfounded) that the Syriac has translated Luke 23: 54 and John 19: 31 (which is certainly the evening) by the same word, that is, because it was the preparation; the same word as Luke; and this word has the natural signification of "becoming dusk," Syriac being the apostles' language.<a name=369:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses, etc.<a name=369:6></a>, saw where they laid Him; Mark 15: 47.<a name=369:7></a> The sabbath over, the two Marys and Salome buy spices.<a name=369:8></a> That is, on Saturday evening they "bought" (not "had bought") them; and Mary Magdalene and the other Mary after this, "late in the sabbath" (Matthew 28: 1), go and see the sepulchre.<a name=369:9></a> It was thus late, after buying the spices.<a name=369:10></a> But Mary Magdalene was absorbed with thoughts of Jesus and not resting at all; while it was yet dark, she comes to the sepulchre (that is, on Sunday morning before day) runs and tells Peter and John, who come and examine the sepulchre and return home.<a name=369:11></a> Mary remains and sees Jesus, and then goes and tells the disciples in general (not to go to Galilee: that was not her message, but) that she had seen Jesus, and that He had told her He was to ascend to His Father and their Father, to His God and their God, that is, their new divine heavenly relationship according to His own through His Person and work.<a name=369:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Mark, who relates the message of the angels to the women as to Galilee, states also that He appeared first to Mary Magdalene, of which John gives the detail.<a name=369:13></a> Mary Magdalene's occupation of mind is evident all through, and John to whom she went gives the detail of this part in accordance with the subject of all his Gospel.<a name=369:14></a> She did not wait to see anything else at the sepulchre.<a name=369:15></a> Seeing the stone rolled away, she set off at once to Peter and John (those specially attached to Jesus) to tell them the sepulchre was empty.<a name=369:16></a> The risen Saviour appears to her with the message cited.<a name=369:17></a> Jesus Himself drew her as an object of affection.<a name=369:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The only passage here which presents any difficulty is "they said nothing to any man," Mark 16: 8.<a name=370:11></a> From verse 7 it is evident that in result they told the disciples; only in going (fleeing) they said nothing to any one on the road till they reached the disciples.<a name=370:12></a> Matthew, indeed, does not say they executed their commission.<a name=370:13></a> Christ met them in Galilee on a mountain where He had ordered them to meet Him.<a name=370:14></a> The last words of this Gospel take up distinctly the Galilean place, and shew that He had now authority <i>given Him</i> for more extension, sending them out to all the nations with a new mission; but the point of contact with the old mission was Galilee, the seat of the poor remnant according to Isaiah 8 and 9.<a name=370:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have here omitted Luke, because always in his Gospel he gives the general broad facts, without occupying himself with their order or connection in time.<a name=370:16></a> This is universally his character.<a name=370:17></a> He is perfectly exact, and in this way gives much additional moral light on many points.<a name=370:18></a> But as he is occupied with this, it is not the purpose of the Spirit in his Gospel to narrate historically.<a name=370:19></a> He will take from many periods what will bring out in common the same truth; or single out one fact which shews it forth without heeding the other accompanying ones, or name them without reference to their order in time, if their moral order be different, as in the temptation in the wilderness.<a name=370:20></a> So he passes over the flight into Egypt; and shews how, things being accomplished in the temple, they went to Nazareth, because he was not to take up the Jewish character of Christ, but the contrary.<a name=370:21></a> And hence, when obedience to the law was personally accomplished, Jesus gets at once into His Nazarene character.<a name=370:22></a>

		It is the same in principle in the history of the resurrection.<a name=371:1></a> The women who had accompanied Him <i>from Galilee</i> (that is their character), having followed, beheld the sepulchre and how His body was laid; and having returned they prepared spices and ointments.<a name=371:2></a> He does not say, they bought, nor when they prepared.<a name=371:3></a> Perhaps they did on Friday night as well as Saturday: I doubt it, however; for at 6 o'clock sabbath began, and it must have been about that, if not quite, when they returned.<a name=371:4></a> They rested the sabbath, but the Greek here in Luke 23: 56, gives it a moral character, and not the date after the buying.<a name=371:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So, in chapter 24: 8-10, we have merely the general fact as to all the women that came from Galilee, without any detail; and to the eleven <i>and all the rest</i> Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James, <i>and the others with them</i>, told these things to the apostles.<a name=371:6></a> It was the affair of the women: where, and when, or who, to each or to several or collectively, is passed over entirely.<a name=371:7></a> It was not the object here of the Spirit of God.<a name=371:8></a> What He does tell us is the fact, and He gives it a moral character, and some additional particulars which are not elsewhere, but no details.<a name=371:9></a> It is possible that more than one party of women went to the sepulchre, and that hearing from the first party or through their means they went down.<a name=371:10></a> However, I have no object in supposing it: verses 22, 23 would rather say otherwise, as also verse 1.<a name=371:11></a> I do not speak here of Mary Magdalene.<a name=371:12></a> But this the scripture was not concerned to tell us.<a name=371:13></a> Each word of what it does tell us bears truth in it <i>for the soul.<a name=371:14></a> So</i> verses 23, 24.<a name=371:15></a> It is all put generally together; for we may well suppose that verse 24 refers to Peter and John, though most likely the two that went to Emmaus only heard this as a general report.<a name=371:16></a>

		Verse 12 also is thus given as a confirming fact after the very vague general statement of all the women -- telling the apostles and all the rest.<a name=372:1></a> They were about one hundred and twenty, men and women.<a name=372:2></a> These preparatory facts are really introductory almost to the account of the journey to Emmaus, which is also alluded to in Mark.<a name=372:3></a> The <i>general</i> effect of the women's statement is given in verse 11.<a name=372:4></a> However, there was exception.<a name=372:5></a> For instance, Peter (it is not "Then Peter" as in the English; but should be "But Peter") arose and went and saw and departed, wondering at what had happened; but, as John tells us, he had no scriptural understanding of, or faith in, the resurrection.<a name=372:6></a>

		THE FACTS OF THE LORD'S RESURRECTION, IN THEIR RELATIVE ORDER
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Each Gospel has only a selection or summary connected with its own immediate subject.<a name=373:1></a> Thus, in Matthew, no interview of our Lord with His apostles is mentioned, but on the mountain in Galilee where a specific commission is given.<a name=373:2></a> Now, we know from the Acts that He was seen of them forty days, and conversed on the things pertaining to the kingdom of God.<a name=373:3></a> John gives His meeting with the apostles on two successive Lord's days, not to speak of the subsequent scene at the sea of Tiberias.<a name=373:4></a> 1 Corinthians 15 relates several distinct appearances of the risen Saviour, in one of which He was seen of above five hundred brethren at once.<a name=373:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All this shews how entirely these accounts are matters of inspiration, and not merely the memory aided or directed by the Holy Ghost.<a name=373:6></a> The things which, in such a case, Matthew, for instance, must have recollected, and might naturally have been expected to record, he does not, but simply gives (or rather the Spirit by him) what was suitable to the special aim of his Gospel.<a name=373:7></a> Not a hint is dropped of those meetings with the apostles in Jerusalem, though Matthew beyond doubt was there.<a name=373:8></a> But the Spirit led him purposely to omit all notice of Jerusalem, and of the Lord's visits there after the resurrection.<a name=373:9></a> His business was to shew the Lord in His accustomed place with the disciples, only widening their mission from the lost sheep of Israel to all the nations, in virtue of the universal power given to Him, the risen Son of man, and the name of God now fully revealed according to the dispensation which superseded Judaism.<a name=373:10></a> The scene of the ascension is also omitted there.<a name=373:11></a> A similar principle applies to the three other accounts.<a name=373:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Comparing the Gospels, we find, first, that the disciples were all in great perplexity.<a name=373:13></a> They had no idea of resurrection.<a name=373:14></a> So John expressly tells us; and this same thing appears in the avowal of the two on the road to Emmaus.<a name=373:15></a> "Yea, and certain women, also, of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre, and when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.<a name=373:16></a> And certain," etc.<a name=373:17></a> Though some of the particular circumstances, or facts, were credited by individuals, there was no understanding of the great truth.<a name=373:18></a> Then we learn that Mary Magdalene, the other Mary, and Salome, if not more, came to the sepulchre with spices.<a name=373:19></a><a href="#373:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> These found the stone rolled away.<a name=373:20></a> Mary Magdalene runs and tells Peter and John of the empty tomb; and they, hastening, found it so, and went away again to their own home.<a name=373:21></a> The women go in, and the angel or angels address them, announcing His resurrection according to His own word.<a name=373:22></a>

		At this moment, as at the former, Mary Magdalene seems to have been alone outside, weeping, when the angels addressed her; then, turning round, she sees and converses with Jesus Himself, receiving a special message to the disciples.<a name=374:1></a> Jesus met all the women subsequently, and gave them a general message to the disciples.<a name=374:2></a> They had fled away affrighted before, and said nothing; reassured now, they told all.<a name=374:3></a> It appears that Mary Magdalene went off as soon as she saw the stone rolled away, and had then seen nothing of the angels; and that as the women went in fear to tell the disciples what the angel said, the Lord met them, and added His personal testimony to that of the angels.<a name=374:4></a> From Mark we learn that He was first seen of Mary Magdalene.<a name=374:5></a> From Matthew we gather that, soon after, He met the women on their way to the disciples.<a name=374:6></a>

		THE CLOSING COMMISSIONS IN THE GOSPELS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are four different addresses or commissions in the four different Gospels, each of them distinct and consequent on the character of the Gospel.<a name=376:1></a> In Matthew 28 it is the exaltation of Messiah to all power in heaven and earth, from which flows the mission to disciple all the Gentiles.<a name=376:2></a> This was a specific commission, contrasted with that to the lost sheep of the house of Israel -- "the children.<a name=376:3></a>" Now His exaltation, on His rejection by them, took a wider scope.<a name=376:4></a> They were to disciple all the nations.<a name=376:5></a> Such was the consequence of His rejection by Israel.<a name=376:6></a> The baptising of the Gentiles was not to be into John's or Messiah's baptism, but into that of which the full revelation was by His death and resurrection -- into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.<a name=376:7></a> This was the position and unfolded fellowship with God into which they were brought; and all that was brought out, on God's part, both for the display of Himself and the economy of grace.<a name=376:8></a> It was not Jehovah and Messiah, but Father, Son, and Holy Ghost -- something paramount and superior to the relationship of Messiah on the earth having followers, or Jehovah in heaven, however blessed.<a name=376:9></a> They were brought into distinct known relationship with or in the unfolded fulness of the Godhead.<a name=376:10></a> They were children of the Father, in fellowship with the glorified Son, and the Holy Ghost dwelling in them; and they knew all three.<a name=376:11></a> It is the most formal statement of the Christian revelation as replacing Judaism; the sphere is enlarged to embrace all nations, and the observance of what Christ commanded is substituted for the law of Moses.<a name=376:12></a> Those who went forth to disciple the Gentiles were messengers of the King, whose presence would be with them till the end of the age, when He Himself should appear in the glory of His kingdom.<a name=376:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Mark, being more especially the witness of the ministry of Christ, gives (not the outreaching principle of dispensation now opened by His death and resurrection and founded on the place of power where He was, but) the principle, the new principle, of the ministry itself and its consequences.<a name=376:14></a> "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to the whole creation.<a name=376:15></a>" We may compare Romans 1, and Colossians 1: 23.<a name=376:16></a> It is a question here, not of the kingdom, but of salvation; and hence baptism as a fact and personal confession of Christ is insisted on, not its form in contradistinction to Judaism.<a name=376:17></a> The unbeliever shall be condemned.<a name=376:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=377>[Page 377]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Luke, suitable to that Gospel, we have not the economical change which went forth to reduce all the Gentiles to a recognition of Christ, or the character and universal extent of the gospel, but its moral subject and scope, involving withal Jew and Gentile alike as sinners; for he specially looks at man.<a name=377:1></a> Hence it runs there: "Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.<a name=377:2></a>" It is beautiful to see that while the need and ruin of man are fully met, testimony to "the Jew first" is not forgotten, even if Jerusalem were first in guilt as well as privilege.<a name=377:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In John, as the Sonship of Christ is the great subject (who He -- the Son of God -- was in Person), the authority and power of His Person in mission was the thing brought forward.<a name=377:4></a> "As my Father hath sent me; even so send I you.<a name=377:5></a> And when he had said this, he breathed on them and said unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost: whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained.<a name=377:6></a>" We have here the authority of the Sender from His Person, tide, and work.<a name=377:7></a> This was authority delegated in grace by the rejected but risen Son of God, giving peace to His own and sending forth with peace for others, in a world which knows neither Him nor it.<a name=377:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to these commissions (while the spirit and principle of all remains, and so far as we have spiritual power, we can realise them), yet all, I believe, have been perverted and have fallen, like all else in man's hand.<a name=377:9></a> As the Jewish economy received a deadly wound by the golden calf for example, so did this very soon; and though the energy of God's grace and Spirit prerogatively might work and produce effects in sustaining and prolonging power and mercy in righteousness as such, the thing was gone; but it is the same power which originally constituted it which always lives and acts, though not in justifying the iniquity, for it is the power of the Spirit of God.<a name=377:10></a> And in measure as we act on this, the results are produced <i>pro tanto</i>.<a name=377:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here is spiritual wisdom, to see, and own, and bow under the sense of the apostasy (that is, under God's judgment of man's unrighteousness -- God is always abidingly righteous in all His ways), and yet still hold fast to the living power which is the energy of the Spirit of God which works prerogatively in blessing.<a name=377:12></a> Of this the extraordinary example and scriptural illustration is Paul -- the <i>abortion</i> of other hopes.<a name=377:13></a> And God is glorified in this; for the failure of man always brings out further and better things, though it may be in trial, than that which has decayed and passed away in his hands.<a name=377:14></a> The death of Stephen in fact was the turning-point and formed the occasion of the bringing in the character of the dispensation as now exercised.<a name=377:15></a>

		In the calling of the centurion by Peter (Acts 10 and 11) God shewed that He never departed from His purpose of associating the Gentiles as brought in with the Jews; and that, as regards administration, they bore not the root, but the root them.<a name=378:1></a> And so says Paul, bowing to this in his ministry, "It was necessary that the word of God should be first preached unto you; but seeing ye count yourselves unworthy of eternal life, lo we turn to the Gentiles.<a name=378:2></a> <i>For so hath the Lord commanded</i> us, saying, I have set thee for a light to the Gentiles" (a sentence used on the Lord's rejection by Israel, "Then have I laboured in vain and spent my strength for nought and in vain"; whereas Peter was the minister of the circumcision, and could not take <i>this</i> ground, blessed in office as he was) "and that thou shouldest be my salvation unto the ends of the earth.<a name=378:3></a>" Thus they take the spiritual interpretation of a passage significative of the dispensation, as a command which guided their conduct, though something else was first necessary.<a name=378:4></a> It was just following the Lord's own way, taking up His primacy and bowing to it ("it was necessary," etc.<a name=378:5></a>), and then His glorious mission according to the energy of the Holy Ghost.<a name=378:6></a> Yet were Israel and Zion still well-beloved; and so Paul shewed ever.<a name=378:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a great thing for us, beloved friends, in all our path to know where we are, and then to know the mind of God, not only as to where we are, but as to our place in the path in which we find ourselves.<a name=379:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Not only has God visited us in grace, but we have to take into our minds what the actual present result of that grace is, so that we hold fast the great principles under which God has set us as Christians; and at the same time be able to apply those principles to the circumstances in which we find ourselves.<a name=379:2></a> These circumstances may vary according to our position, but the principles never vary.<a name=379:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Their application to the path of faith may vary and does.<a name=379:4></a> I mean such a thing as this: in Hezekiah's time they were told, "In quietness and in confidence shall be your strength," and the Assyrian should not even cast a bank before Jerusalem.<a name=379:5></a> They were to stay perfectly calm and firm; and the host of Assyria was destroyed.<a name=379:6></a> But when a certain time of judgment was come, in Jeremiah's time, then he that went out of the city to the Chaldeans, their enemies, should save himself.<a name=379:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		They were still God's people as much as before, though He was saying for the time in judgment -- "not my people," and that made the difference.<a name=379:8></a> It was not that God's mind was altered or His relationship to His people changed -- that never will be.<a name=379:9></a> Yet the conduct of the people was to be exactly the opposite.<a name=379:10></a> Under Hezekiah they were protected; under Zedekiah they were to bow to the judgment.<a name=379:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I refer to these circumstances as a testimony, to show that while the relationship of God with Israel is immutable in this world, yet their conduct at one time had to be the opposite to that at another.<a name=379:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Look at the beginning of the Acts of the Apostles, as regards the church, God's assembly in the world.<a name=379:13></a> There I find the full display of power; all had one heart and one mind and they had all things in common; the very place was shaken where they were.<a name=379:14></a> But suppose I take the church now, including the Roman Catholic system and all, if we look at all that and own it, we bow down to everything that is evil at once.<a name=379:15></a>

		While God's thoughts do not change and He knows His people and so on, yet we need spiritual discernment to see where we are, and what the ways of God are in the circumstances, while never departing from the first great principles which He has laid down for us in His word.<a name=380:1></a> Another thing, too, we have to take account of as a fact of Scripture, is that wherever God has set man, the first thing man has done has been to spoil the position; we must ever take that into account.<a name=380:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Look at Adam, Noah, Aaron, Solomon and Nebuchadnezzar.<a name=380:3></a> God goes on in patient mercy, yet the uniform way of man, as we read in Scripture, has been at once to upset and destroy the thing which God set up good.<a name=380:4></a> Consequently, there cannot be any walking with a true knowledge of our position if this is not considered.<a name=380:5></a> But God is faithful and goes on in patient love.<a name=380:6></a> Thus in Isaiah 6 we find "Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes" and so on, but it was not fulfilled for 800 years, and when Christ came they rejected Him.<a name=380:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Patience went on in that way, individual souls were converted, there were various testimonies by the prophets and a remnant was preserved still.<a name=380:8></a> But if we should plead the faithfulness of God, which is invariable, to put a positive sanction upon the evil which man has brought in, our whole principle is false.<a name=380:9></a>

		That would be exactly what they did in Jeremiah's time when judgment was coming, and what Christendom is doing now; they said, "The temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, are these," and "The law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise," when they were all going to Babylon.<a name=380:10></a> The faithfulness of God was invariable, but the moment they applied that to sustain them in the place of evil, it became the very ground of their ruin.<a name=380:11></a> The same principles which would be our security become, if we leave out the sense of where we are, our ruin.<a name=380:12></a>

but there is confusion in some minds between the purposes of God, and present dispensation in which man is placed under responsibility.<a name=392:12></a> In speaking of the ruin of the church, we speak of it as down here, set to manifest Christ's glory in unity on the earth, and we must remember that there we are placed, and as in this responsibility, there we must stay.<a name=392:13></a> If it could fail spiritually it would be disastrous indeed!<a name=392:14></a> There are two thoughts respecting the church in ruin which are full of mischief.<a name=392:15></a> The thought on some brethren's minds is, that we intend by this the interruption of God's purpose, which evidently cannot be.<a name=392:16></a> There is a jealousy, which I respect and for which I have no regret, lest the idea of the church in ruin should seem to affect the purpose of God.<a name=392:17></a> As regards the purpose of God the church cannot be ruined, but as regards its actual present condition as a testimony for God on earth it is in ruin.<a name=392:18></a> The other thought is: Well, suppose it is in ruin, so it must be; there we are and there we must stay; so that we are saved at last, never mind; we will take no thought about the present condition of the church, being satisfied that we are saved from the wrath to come.<a name=392:19></a> This listlessness and hanging down of the hands, causing cessation of all spiritual energy, is induced by a want of apprehension of what the church is in God's sight.<a name=392:20></a> But practically many saints think they are to remain content in the ruin.<a name=392:21></a> There is danger in taking up such a thought, because it would be the denial of the power of God.<a name=392:22></a> To unbelief discouragement may be the result of this idea of the church's ruin, but I do not look at it as discouragement, because I believe the grace and power of the Lord is suited to the need of the church <i>such as it is</i> at all times.<a name=392:23></a> I should feel it to be a very sad effect if the expression "ruin of the church" were to dishearten a soul about the operation of the Spirit in bringing blessing to the church.<a name=392:24></a> Neither of the suppositions I have alluded to can be proved, for it is impossible that the church can be in utter ruin in the sense of upsetting God's purpose, or that the <i>power of the Lord is</i> enfeebled when there is actual present ruin.<a name=392:25></a> His working will be according to the <i>state the church is in</i>, not to the state she is not in.<a name=392:26></a> We are all liable from the feebleness of our minds to say too much or too little, even where truth is held.<a name=392:27></a> Man is in a sad state, and I should get disheartened unless I saw the power of Christ to meet that state.<a name=392:28></a> God's purpose, of course, is unfailing, and therefore it is not true that the church can fail as it exists in God's purpose.<a name=392:29></a> What we want is not so much an abstract notion that the church will be saved, but real practical faith in the application of the resources of God to meet present circumstances.<a name=392:30></a> If a Christian is in a bad state, and I do not look beyond it to Christ I am troubled, but if I do I have confidence, and in that sense I am at rest, because I know the Lord can and will bring it right by His power working for him.<a name=392:31></a> I should feel sorry if seeing failure should enfeeble faith as to the Lord's care of the church, and I have felt the danger of this; still I say He introduces blessing according to the present condition of the church.<a name=392:32></a> We must not say, if we are looking for blessing in the path of faith, the church is sure to be brought through according to God's purpose of grace, it would produce listlessness; we have to look to the present working of His power in blessing to glorify Christ.<a name=392:33></a> God always takes an interest in the church's circumstances, and if we are looking for blessing, we shall find it even in times of the greatest failure, for God will have His church in glory, and living faith sees not only the need, but sees also the thoughts and mind of the Lord about that need, and counts on the present love of the Lord.<a name=392:34></a> It is as true of an individual as of the church.<a name=392:35></a> As having the Spirit of Christ I cannot rest in the thought that a Christian is secure in Christ, and therefore not endeavour to instruct and exhort him and lead him on.<a name=392:36></a> The church will be saved, and so will every member of it; but if I have the affections of Christ, I cannot be contented unless I see the power of the Spirit in any individual saint manifesting that saint's relationship to Christ, and just so is it with the church of God; if my faith is in exercise, I am not satisfied unless I see the carrying out of its relationship to Christ <i>as a present thing</i>.<a name=392:37></a> If I see in an individual saint that which is not consistent, I am not happy, and so of the church.<a name=392:38></a> I do believe in these latter days that the Lord has awakened the minds and souls of many of the saints who were walking in single-eyedness, to examine what the church of God is.<a name=392:39></a> Therefore it is not surprising that Satan should come in to resist the truth of the Lord's coming, and the church's relationship to that.<a name=392:40></a> Besides this, many have come into the position of blessing, without knowing in themselves what the church's blessing is, and therefore feebleness is the result, for when worldliness crept in they fell backward and were discouraged.<a name=392:41></a> They had fellowship in the blessing, but they had not intelligence and fellowship in the principle and grace that produced the blessing, and consequently when there is the want of blessing, restless apprehension and uncertainty will be the result, for when Satan comes in upon our souls, the shallowness of our faith appears.<a name=392:42></a>

		Well, I see this, and bless the Lord that He is awakening in the souls of many saints everywhere the question -- "What is the church of God?<a name=394:1></a>" I have no doubt that with many very dear saints we should find that they have no definite idea of what the church is beyond the thought, that there are certain persons who are saved and brought to glory.<a name=394:2></a> This is true, but then it is clear that the understanding of the relationship in which the church stands to Christ is the basis of all its affections to Christ.<a name=394:3></a> If the Lord is now awakening saints to the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the relationship of the church of Christ, and it is not understood, we cannot be bearing a true and faithful testimony for God; and I add further that the truth which does not come up to any special testimony of God at a given time is used by Satan to hinder its reception.<a name=394:4></a> Satan will use a past testimony to hinder the reception of the testimony God has raised up for His saints.<a name=394:5></a> Thus, the unity of the Godhead is a truth we all hold, but it was held by the Jews for the upset of Christianity.<a name=394:6></a> They held "Jehovah our God is one Jehovah," but they did not hold the Father and the Son.<a name=394:7></a> Thus they strove to upset the special testimony by which God was then acting -- the revelation of the Father and the Son.<a name=394:8></a> If God is presenting truth to set His saints in a place of testimony, Satan will also seek to perplex their minds about that very truth, so that they should not be able to give any testimony concerning it.<a name=394:9></a> If Satan succeeds in distracting their minds so that they become tired of it, and go back to <i>past truth</i>, then Satan has gained his point by perplexing their minds.<a name=394:10></a> Now this is most important.<a name=394:11></a> Yet the Lord has always the upper hand of Satan.<a name=394:12></a> I doubt not there will be some Lots, who will get tired, but I believe the exercise of soul on the subject will be used by the Lord to bring the souls of those who are faithful on to more solid ground.<a name=394:13></a> Thus as to the Lord's second coming, and the presence of the Holy Ghost in the church, many may get hindered, but souls walking in simplicity will be more strengthened by these efforts of Satan.<a name=394:14></a>

		As regards the salvation of any soul, it is by the blood and work of the Lord Jesus Christ, but I do not dwell now on the great truth of the work of Christ, and the quickening of the Spirit; neither do I dwell on the fact that the Old Testament saints were saved by the blood, and will be in resurrection glory with the Lord.<a name=395:1></a> I assume all this as acknowledged truth, taking it for granted that the soul may rest there, while I go on to other points.<a name=395:2></a> And first, Has God taught us anything about the church of God?<a name=395:3></a>

		Now there are many very precious saints, sound in the faith, who are not prepared to accept what the church of God is as set forth in the word of God.<a name=396:1></a> If it is meant that all the saints ever saved will in the end be in company in glory, and surround the second Adam as His family, so to speak, in redemption and life through Him, and they call that the Assembly of God, I have no objection.<a name=396:2></a> I do not doubt that the second Adam will have all around Him in glory, as the first Adam had all around him in sin.<a name=396:3></a> But scripture speaks of another thing which greatly concerns us -- of our <i>place</i>, our <i>privileges</i> and <i>responsibilities</i>.<a name=396:4></a> In Israel it was the same thing; it was true that there was salvation before Israel was a people, for Abraham was saved before Israel was brought in, and yet there was a distinct revelation concerning Israel, and relationship based on it; and if any neglected the revelation, they would not only have been unfaithful, but would have lost blessing.<a name=396:5></a> David was saved as Abraham was, but the manner of his relationship and responsibilities towards God on earth were not the same as Abraham's, because David formed part of a people placed in a position, the claims of which did not apply to Abraham.<a name=396:6></a> If Samuel and others had neglected this, they would have been unfaithful to God, because the ground on which God had set them as a <i>nation</i> was the measure of their special responsibility to Him.<a name=396:7></a> In the word of God I find that the church of the living God is a body brought into testimony by the Spirit of God definitely and distinctly, as set in a special relationship to God.<a name=396:8></a> And now, as the Lord may enable me, I will shew you what the church is.<a name=396:9></a>

		The church of the living God is the body of saints formed on earth in unity with Christ in heaven as the Head, by the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven to form them into unity with Christ at the right hand of God.<a name=396:10></a> The church is not merely a number of saved persons, but a body formed into unity with Christ their Head, by the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven consequent on the exaltation of Jesus to the right hand of God.<a name=396:11></a> There has been a habit of calling all the saints from first to last the church, and there is a fear lest tender-hearted saints who have done so should be alarmed by altering it.<a name=396:12></a> I greatly respect the jealousy of souls (who have the consciousness of the electing love of God, in saving every one whom He has called from Adam downward), in being alarmed lest this distinction should affect the foundation of salvation through the blood according to God's electing love; but still it is my duty as well as my privilege to understand the position in which God has set me, and to call by the right name what God has called by name in scripture.<a name=396:13></a>

		We all know the way the Epistle to the Ephesians speaks of this; indeed that epistle is founded on the truth that God has set Christ far above all principality and power in heavenly places consequent on His death and humiliation.<a name=397:17></a> Redemption work gave Him the title, although <i>as the Son</i> it was His already.<a name=397:18></a> The church is put into association with Him <i>there</i>; Ephesians 1 and 2.<a name=397:19></a> Before Christ came they waited for righteousness, and God forbore, but now we are waiting for the <i>hope</i> of righteousness; not waiting for righteousness, but for the hope -- what belongs to righteousness.<a name=397:20></a> The righteousness of God is perfect in its accomplishment, Christ the Righteous One being set down in glory.<a name=397:21></a> God has now set up a people in union with Christ their Head by the power of the Holy Ghost; hence I find that Jew and Gentile distinctions are done away.<a name=397:22></a> Before, the whole ground of God's dealings was the distinction of His people the Jews from the Gentiles, but now there is "neither Jew nor Gentile, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free.<a name=397:23></a>" Was that ever before?<a name=397:24></a> At that time they were Gentiles in the flesh, but now made nigh.<a name=397:25></a> He "hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition.<a name=397:26></a>" God had Himself built up the wall between them which He has now broken down, to make of twain one new man.<a name=397:27></a> Now many a Jew had been saved, but had not been made one new man with Gentile sinners called by God, through Him who hung upon the cross and abolished the enmity, and having ascended on high formed both into one new man in Himself.<a name=397:28></a> Simeon and Anna and many godly Jews who looked for redemption in Israel were saved, and saved, of course, as alone any can be, as saints are now saved; and what did God do with them?<a name=397:29></a> left them Jews.<a name=397:30></a> But when Peter preached and three thousand souls believed, what did God do with them?<a name=397:31></a> He added them to the church "In whom also ye are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.<a name=397:32></a>" The old habitation -- a temple made with hands -- is cast down, and a new one formed both of Jews and Gentiles.<a name=397:33></a> Ephesians 3 opens out this mystery and adds, "Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly .<a name=397:34></a>.<a name=397:35></a>.<a name=397:36></a> according to the power that worketh <i>in us</i>"; not <i>for us</i> Chapter 4 is practically speaking of <i>the vocation</i>.<a name=397:37></a> If we get away from what has previously been spoken of, we cannot walk worthily of the calling <i>by which we are called</i>, and God has called the saints to be His habitation.<a name=397:38></a> It is not enough to be merely saints, but they must listen to the vocation, and endeavour to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.<a name=397:39></a> It was not enough for Abraham to be a saint, but he must leave Ur of the Chaldees, because this was his calling, and if he had not obeyed, he would have acted most inconsistently as a man of God.<a name=397:40></a> When God had given him a sign to keep of His covenant relationship with Him, if his posterity had neglected to keep it, they would have been cut off from God's people -- outwardly manifested as such on the earth.<a name=397:41></a> So also we do not answer to God's calling unless we obey it.<a name=397:42></a> Of course, the church will form a glorious body in heaven, but the Spirit in addressing the church does so as on the earth.<a name=397:43></a> The Holy Ghost has come down and formed the church for a habitation of God here on the earth, not in heaven.<a name=397:44></a> In Ephesians 4 we find certain gifts for the edifying of the body of Christ on the earth, not to edify it in heaven; "edifying itself in love" that is not in heaven; "making increase of the body" must be on earth.<a name=397:45></a>

		It occurs to me to add a thought as to difficulties in some minds.<a name=402:1></a> The church of God as distinguished from other things which are found in scripture.<a name=402:2></a> This is not only a question of interest to our minds, but one of extreme importance.<a name=402:3></a> First, the question as to Romans 11.<a name=402:4></a> To many minds it has the appearance of grafting the church on to the previous system.<a name=402:5></a> This has the effect of keeping the mind in abeyance.<a name=402:6></a> If our souls are kept in hesitation there is no affection at work, and what I desire to see is active affection.<a name=402:7></a> Secondly, Ephesians 2: 19, "Fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God.<a name=402:8></a>" Lastly, distinguishing between the church of God and the kingdom of heaven.<a name=402:9></a> There are two things (Matthew 16), "On this rock I will build my church"; there is no key there.<a name=402:10></a> Then it is further said to Peter, "I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven.<a name=402:11></a>"

		It is clear to me that Romans 11, properly speaking, has nothing to do with the church as such, though it has to do with those who go to form the church.<a name=402:12></a> There is no thought here of the body in unity with the Head in heaven.<a name=402:13></a> The unbelieving Jews were broken off because of unbelief.<a name=402:14></a> Now in no possible sense could it be said that the Jews were broken off from the church, for they were never in it.<a name=402:15></a> The apostle speaks also of breaking off the Gentile branches.<a name=402:16></a> That cannot be the church, because in no possible sense can it be said that the church of the living God in its true sense is broken off.<a name=402:17></a> The whole wording of the chapter proves that the olive tree has reference to the line and channel of the administration of God's promises on the earth.<a name=402:18></a> In <i>that</i> all this takes place.<a name=402:19></a> The children of Israel were heirs of promise according to the flesh; they were broken off <i>and the Gentiles</i> graffed in.<a name=402:20></a> The Gentiles will be broken off if they do not continue in God's goodness, and the Jews graffed in again.<a name=402:21></a> The church cannot be broken off nor graffed in again; the olive tree shews the successional administration of God's promises on the earth.<a name=402:22></a> It is connected with God's outward dealings, and the moment this is seen the difficulty of the chapter is removed.<a name=402:23></a> The Jews will be graffed into their own Olive Tree again, not into this new thing, the church of God.<a name=402:24></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The passage in Ephesians is in direct contrast with what is here spoken of as the olive tree; it owns neither Jew nor Gentile.<a name=402:25></a> It is the position of the church down here, "fellow citizens with the saints.<a name=402:26></a>" It is a simple fact that the Gentiles are what they never were before, but so, too, are the Jews who believe.<a name=402:27></a> The Gentiles are not brought into the previous condition of the Jews.<a name=402:28></a> The passage does not speak of a previous Jewish state, the Jews themselves together with Gentiles are brought into a new condition where both are made <i>one new man</i>; they are "fellow citizens" together.<a name=402:29></a> It is not uniting the Gentiles to the previous Jewish constitution, but bringing Jews and Gentiles into a common new one.<a name=402:30></a>

		In Romans 11 the point discussed is whether God has cast away His people.<a name=404:12></a> Whether Israel whom He foreknew should be cast off?<a name=404:13></a> "God forbid!<a name=404:14></a>" says Paul, "for I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.<a name=404:15></a> God hath not cast away his people whom he foreknew"; though He may have cast off the nation temporarily.<a name=404:16></a> Now this question applied to the church would have been utter nonsense, as He was then and ever since gathering the church of God in by the gospel.<a name=404:17></a> "But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.<a name=404:18></a>" Was this casting them off?<a name=404:19></a> In verses 4, 11, 26, the apostle gives three proofs that God had not cast off His people.<a name=404:20></a> God replied to Elijah when he said that he was left alone, It is not so at all, for "I have reserved unto myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal.<a name=404:21></a>" "Even so then at this present time also," says the apostle, "there is a remnant according to the election of grace.<a name=404:22></a>" Again, God is caring for them in the very bringing in of the Gentiles "to provoke them to jealousy.<a name=404:23></a>" And again, "So all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob.<a name=404:24></a>" At the close of chapter 8 the apostle had finished the salvation question -- "no condemnation.<a name=404:25></a>" Then comes the difficulty that in planting the saints in Christ he threw down the special place of the Jews -- "there is no difference.<a name=404:26></a>" He then reconciles this with God's immutable purposes towards Israel, and in chapter 9 reasons thus: If you say that as a child of Abraham you have a right, then Ishmael and Esau come in.<a name=404:27></a> Your national claim is through God's sovereignty, your own title of descent from Abraham will not stand, for then Ishmael and Esau have a title to come in.<a name=404:28></a> God exercises this same sovereignty in letting in Gentiles.<a name=404:29></a> Then in chapter 10 he shews the Jews how they <i>stumbled</i>.<a name=404:30></a> This is not the principle of <i>sovereignty</i> as in chapter 9; it had happened according to the plain testimony of the Old Testament: "They stumbled at that stumbling stone.<a name=404:31></a>" God has not ceased to care for Israel, He is still carrying out His plan as to them, and the Gentiles have been graffed in.<a name=404:32></a> If some of the branches are broken off it shews there must be some remaining, and He cares for them.<a name=404:33></a> "If God spared not the natural branches.<a name=404:34></a>" Now who are the "<i>natural</i> branches" of <i>the church</i> of God?<a name=404:35></a> The natural branches are looked at as having been in the position of heirs of promise down here on the earth, and God is able to graff them in again (these Jews who were broken off) into the position on earth of heirs of promise.<a name=404:36></a> It is impossible to apply all this to the church, "Blindness in part has happened <i>to Israel</i> until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.<a name=404:37></a>" How can this be the church?<a name=404:38></a> "The Jews beloved for the fathers' sakes.<a name=404:39></a>" Is this the church of the living God?<a name=404:40></a>

		LETTER ON "APOSTASY"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Beloved Brethren and Sisters in Christ, <br>The day of the apostasy is hastening on with rapid strides, and also the day in which the Lord shall come to snatch His own away.<a name=407:1></a> The present moment is of so solemn a character that I feel constrained to address you this word of exhortation.<a name=407:2></a> Godly men everywhere, who watch the signs of the times, see the moment approaching which shall terminate the present actings of grace.<a name=407:3></a> The time has evidently arrived when one must speak plainly and decisively, and ask you where you are, and what you are about.<a name=407:4></a> You have by grace, which has shone brighter and brighter as it has approached its termination, been gathered out of the seething mass of idolatry and wickedness which now threatens Christendom and the world with an overthrow more awful than that of Sodom and Gomorrah of old; and the question is whether you are adequately impressed with the responsibility, as well as the blessedness, of the ground you are on, and walking like men and women whose eyes have been opened.<a name=407:5></a> Believe me, there has never been in the world's history such a time as the present, and Satan is occupied with none as he is with you; and his occupation with you is the more to be feared because of the subtlety of his operations.<a name=407:6></a> His object is to withdraw your attention from Christ, while you suppose you are on safe ground and have nothing to fear.<a name=407:7></a> He would destroy you with the very truth itself.<a name=407:8></a> For mark the subtlety: you ARE on safe ground but ONLY while Christ is your all in all.<a name=407:9></a> Here is where Satan is drawing some away.<a name=407:10></a> Interpose anything between your soul and Christ, and your Philadelphia becomes Laodicea; your safe ground is as unsafe as the rest of Christendom; your strength is gone from you, and you become weak, like any ordinary mortal.<a name=407:11></a> Some of you are young, recently converted, or brought to the right ways of the Lord, and you do not know the depths of Satan.<a name=407:12></a> But you are hereby solemnly warned of your peril; and if mischief overtake you, you cannot plead ignorance.<a name=407:13></a> Again I say, Satan has his eye especially upon YOU, for the purpose of interposing the world in some form between your soul and Christ.<a name=407:14></a> He cares not how little, or in what form.<a name=407:15></a> If you knew but how little will answer his purpose, you would be alarmed.<a name=407:16></a> It is not by that which is gross or shameful; such is the DEVELOPMENT, not the BEGINNING of evil.<a name=407:17></a> It is not by anything glaring that he seeks to ruin you, but in small and seemingly harmless trifles -- trifles that would not shock nor offend anyone as things go, and yet these constitute the deadly and insidious poison, destined to ruin your testimony and withdraw you from Christ.<a name=407:18></a> Do you ask what are these alarming symptoms, and where are they seen?<a name=407:19></a> The question does but shew what is the character of the opiate at work.<a name=407:20></a> Brethren and sisters, you are being infected with the spirit of the world.<a name=407:21></a> Your dress, your manner, your talk, your lack of spirituality, betray it in every gathering.<a name=407:22></a> There is a dead weight, a restraint, a want of power, that reveals itself in the meetings, as plainly as if your heart were visibly displayed and its thoughts publicly read.<a name=407:23></a> A form of godliness without power is beginning to be seen among YOU, as plainly as in Christendom generally.<a name=407:24></a> As surely as you tamper with the world, so surely will you drift away to its level.<a name=407:25></a> This is the nature of things.<a name=407:26></a> It must be so.<a name=407:27></a> If you tamper with the world, the privileged place you occupy, instead of shielding you, will only expose you to greater condemnation.<a name=407:28></a> It must be Christ OR the world.<a name=407:29></a> It cannot be -- ought not to be -- Christ AND the world.<a name=407:30></a> God's grace in drawing you out of the world in your IGNORANCE is one thing, but God will never permit you to prostitute His grace, and play fast and loose, when you have been separated from the world.<a name=407:31></a> Remember you take the place, and claim the privilege, of one whose eyes have been opened; and if on the one hand this is unspeakably blessed (and it is), on the other hand it is the most dreadful position in which a human being can be found.<a name=407:32></a> It is to be at the wedding feast without the wedding garment.<a name=407:33></a> It is to say, "Lord, Lord," while you do not the things that He bids.<a name=407:34></a> It is to say, "I go, sir," as he said who went not.<a name=407:35></a>

		Meanwhile moral truths had come largely out; ceremonial observances contrasted in Israel with divine commandments, but, still further, the heart of man, called in question in contrast with all such mere ordinances, lost in importance, not merely in contrast with divine commandment, but in their nature as merely external; God looked at what came from the heart, not what went into the belly -- a simple truth, but which for man is hard to learn.<a name=415:4></a> God goes to the true nature of things in respect of man -- what comes out of the heart -- what he is; but what did come out of it?<a name=415:5></a> Murders, evil thoughts, all manner of evil, and the Lord had no more to say.<a name=415:6></a> Then He leaves this scene of labour, is alone personally -- as Man in position He would not have it known; but it was.<a name=415:7></a> Then we come to what was known; He goes, as I have said, to the borders of the curse -- the place which served Him as an example of hard-heartedness -- the people on whom God's curse rested as compared with Israel.<a name=415:8></a> What wondrous elements are all brought together here!<a name=415:9></a> But He sought to be alone, i.<a name=415:10></a>e.<a name=415:11></a>, out of His sphere of labour.<a name=415:12></a> His mission, as a sent one, a servant, He insists on.<a name=415:13></a> But a want was there, a want which sought goodness in power, and God was there; the poor woman drawn by it, though purposely repelled to prove her faith (the disciples would have got rid of her -- neither owned promise, nor in fact exercised love as above all promise) draws out what is above all promise, what recognises fury the right to possess where promise was, but appeals to goodness as, after all, reaching over it, fully recognising man's complete misery and wretchedness without a title -- a vile dog, which there was saying everything that was unclean and vile, but appealed to a riches in goodness which could reach in mercy even to that.<a name=415:14></a> Could Christ say "No!<a name=415:15></a> God is not that"?<a name=415:16></a>

		Man answered to this place according to the counsels and glory of God, as the angels, the obedient administrators of power, witnesses of a sustained creation.<a name=420:11></a> But he who had been made in God's image, and now fallen, was in the condition to be the sphere of the display of all God's moral glory, mercy, grace, righteousness, above all, love, for God is love; in a word -- redemption.<a name=420:12></a> Christ was a man.<a name=420:13></a> And now, in the same perfectness, He takes no will, not even of man, not even to eat when He was hungry -- He lives by every word out of the mouth of God.<a name=420:14></a> He humbles Himself and is obedient even unto death, and that of the Cross -- no resistance -- no escape, though legions of angels would be ready at His call.<a name=420:15></a> He perseveres in submitting to all -- a tested obedience, even to death.<a name=420:16></a> Not merely obedience in peace, as Adam innocent might, or an angel (though doubtless they must feel the ruin) but tested by unvarying giving up of self and where evil was.<a name=420:17></a>

		The absolute in nature becomes relative as a Servant in place -- and "no man knoweth the Son but the Father" -- but the Father is revealed; and in this character exalted as Lord above all now.<a name=420:18></a> We adore Him as God, we see Him gone down under death as man, yet emptying Himself, humbling Himself, laying down His own life what belonged to, what was divine all through.<a name=420:19></a> Now, the centre of all the sphere of display of the divine glory and of all in which it is displayed; but this is an outward consequence; Philippians 2.<a name=420:20></a> But the place of Man and Servant never given up -- wondrous truth!<a name=420:21></a> Only He rules over all the sphere of His humiliation -- heaven and earth are subjected to Him -- as Man while such subjection is called for -- He reigns till all things are put under His feet.<a name=420:22></a>

		But in His own personal place, in which He is in connection with us, or rather we with Him, He never gives up the serving place -- He takes it now; John 13.<a name=421:1></a> In Luke 12 He takes it in glory, but in the heavenly blessedness connected with us -- those His Father has given Him.<a name=421:2></a> And finally, when the reigning and subjecting process is complete, and He gives up the kingdom whose power was needed for that, He takes the simple subject place as Man in the eternal blessedness of God -- still "God over all, blessed for evermore," One with the Father -- but His place as the subject Man perfect, and we with Him.<a name=421:3></a> Wondrous thought!<a name=421:4></a> The Firstborn among many brethren (companions <i>metokoi)</i>, not, note (common equal sharers <i>koinonoi)</i> we could not be that.<a name=421:5></a> Compare Hebrews 2: 14, consequent on 11.<a name=421:6></a>

		God -- and no mediatorial kingdom and power -- being all in all -- His emptying is no more undone than His Godhead.<a name=421:7></a> He always was and is Son with the Father -- was and is always God; and now is and ever will be Man, who emptied Himself.<a name=421:8></a> It was, and so ever is, His own divine act; only He has a temporary kingdom according to eternal counsels in this character, a kingdom which He gives up.<a name=421:9></a> The apostle John enters largely into this; his Gospel is the expression of it, but it comes out elsewhere in connection with the names of God, Light and Love, both of them essential names of God, yet with some difference, for Light has something of quality in it belonging to a person -- Love is more absolutely personal.<a name=421:10></a> God is purity and manifests all things.<a name=421:11></a> But we are light in the Lord; as partakers of divine nature, we partake of this quality.<a name=421:12></a> In 2 Peter 1: 4, we are made partakers of divine nature, not of the, and it is by promise our own state.<a name=421:13></a> But we w not love, for Love is sovereign goodness -- that we cannot be; we love as partaking of divine nature too, but we cannot be sovereign goodness.<a name=421:14></a>

		But in Christ's emptying of Himself, and the course of His humiliation unto death, we find this love exercised -- it is divine love expressed -- we have seen the Father in Him -- love brought to need -- love active; "Hereby know we love, because he laid down his life for us.<a name=422:1></a>" So that the revelation of God, that in which His Being acts, according to what He is, was in this way of emptying and self-humbling of Christ; only we add "He gave his only begotten Son," when we speak of it historically in its external action.<a name=422:2></a> And Christ, thus the expression of Love, <i>i.<a name=422:3></a>e</i>.<a name=422:4></a> of God, in the world, God manifest in the flesh, was also necessarily Light in the world -- purity, and showing what all was, but showing sovereign goodness to it when thus manifested.<a name=422:5></a>

		Formally, grace and truth came by Jesus Christ -- He was the love of God in the world, and light in it.<a name=422:6></a> The darkness comprehended it not.<a name=422:7></a> But it was in Man, and it became thus impartitive, the Word of life, "He that hath the Son hath life," they that received Him being born of God; and being cleansed, the Holy Ghost could dwell in them in order to be the power of realisation.<a name=422:8></a> Thus the apostle prays that they "may be strengthened with might by His Spirit in the inner man, that Christ might dwell in their hearts by faith," not merely be life and righteousness, but dwell there in the power of the realisation of faith -- He who is the expression and revelation of love -- that we may be rooted and grounded in it.<a name=422:9></a> We dwell in love and in God, or rather here He in us, and thus are at the centre of the display of glory; the more external thing, and so far finite that it is in that which is created, but the display of God's glory in it, though not without love as its source and sustaining, for it is in redemption.<a name=422:10></a> Christ thus takes in all -- first descended then ascended that He might fill all things -- but then the saints, and this is their wondrous place, are associated with Him personally here, and we "comprehend with all saints"; for they are indeed His companions, loved as He is loved, however personally infinitely above them.<a name=422:11></a>

		Christ has taken this place in the same divine, perfect love, self being gone, that He might put us in the same place with Himself -- whom the Father had given Him -- and even now, His peace, His joy, the Father's words, the Father's love, and the glory given to them -- gone to His Father and our Father, His God and our God -- to be with Him where He is; for in emptying Himself and becoming a Man, it was to associate us, the joint heirs in the same place, though ever Firstborn.<a name=422:12></a> Hence the apostle adds "and to know the love of Christ" -- not abstract here, "rooted and grounded in love," through His dwelling in our hearts, who is the divine fulness of this love -- Himself; but now He has entered into the counsels of actual glory, length, depth, etc.<a name=422:13></a> -- it is the love of Christ, the actual, manifested, exercised love, yet still divine, "it passes knowledge," that we may be thus filled into all the fulness of God Himself, which indeed dwelt in Him bodily; compare 1 John 5: 20.<a name=422:14></a>

		Colossians does not enter on this ground, only touching it in "Christ in you, the hope of glory.<a name=423:1></a>" It is blessed to see how the highest being of God is exercised in grace towards any poor sinner.<a name=423:2></a> It is there it is, though afterwards perfected in us; see 1 John 4: 12, 13.<a name=423:3></a> This has partly led us in this inquiry into the counterpart, that "as he is, so are we," because it is thus we enter into and understand it; "we are in him that is true, i.<a name=423:4></a>e.<a name=423:5></a> in his Son -- he is the true God and eternal life.<a name=423:6></a>"

		But the gospel of John gives us large communications on this humiliation of Christ.<a name=423:7></a> His Godhead shines in every page of all the gospels, but John, as everyone knows, in a peculiar way gives us the Person of Christ -- the Word made flesh Now I have remarked elsewhere the fact of the way in which He is everywhere One with the Father, yet receives all.<a name=423:8></a> But it is the direct expression of the truth we are studying -- He is God, He is one with the Father, He is I Am.<a name=423:9></a> Everywhere He speaks to His Father on a divine footing of unity; "I have glorified thee, now glorify me.<a name=423:10></a>" But He has taken the form of a Servant, never "now I will glorify Myself.<a name=423:11></a>" "My Father is greater than I"; "Father, glorify thou me" -- yet it was a glory He had -- "along with thee (the Father) before the world was," "Thou hast given him power over all flesh" -- "I receive whoever comes, for I came not to do my own will, but the will of him that sent me.<a name=423:12></a>" He finishes the work the Father gave Him to do -- it is the Father that sent Him; so chapter 8: 26.<a name=423:13></a> But it is in this chapter the Lord says: "Before Abraham was, I am," which the Jews well understood.<a name=423:14></a>

		In a word His path was "that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father hath given me commandment, so I do.<a name=423:15></a>" His divine nature and Godhead shine throughout, but He receives everything -- is sent -- and has taken the relative place of recipiency and subjection.<a name=423:16></a> John 5 has a peculiar character in this respect, and presented at first some difficulty to my mind.<a name=423:17></a> "As the Father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them, so the Son quickeneth whom he will"; "My Father worketh hitherto and I work," as the apostle notes, from the Jewish consciousness, making Himself equal with God.<a name=423:18></a> But in verse 19 He at once takes the place He is come into.<a name=423:19></a> "The Son can do nothing of <i>himself</i>, but what he seeth the Father do.<a name=423:20></a>" "Whatsoever he doeth, these doeth the Son likewise," and quickening comes as part of this -- "The Father loves the Son and shews him all.<a name=423:21></a>" But He, though He acts with the same divine power as the Father, yet is shewn all -- does nothing of Himself; and in verse 26 He hath given to the Son to have life in Himself, <i>i.<a name=423:22></a>e</i>.<a name=423:23></a> the Son in the form of a Servant down here, and given Him authority to execute judgment also, because He is Son of man.<a name=423:24></a> So that we know that it is in this humbled state that this applies.<a name=423:25></a>

		Thus it becomes the clearest exposition of this unspeakable truth, the result of that, when in the form of God, He emptied Himself -- His own act -- divine all through, at every moment.<a name=424:1></a> How true it remains, "No man knows the Son but the Father"; but we adore Him.<a name=424:2></a> He is not ashamed to call us brethren, for now we are all of <i>one</i>.<a name=424:3></a>

		But the point my mind rests on is the <i>emptying</i> of Himself; the rest is consequence, however blessed; Psalm 45: 6, 7, and Hebrews 1: 8, 9.<a name=424:4></a> Christ emptied Himself, taking upon Him the form of a Servant.<a name=424:5></a> Our best delight will be to be hidden behind Him and see Him have all the glory.<a name=424:6></a> It is interesting to see that whatever depth the Person of the Lord may give to this, the blessing itself, which has its very character from its adaptation to our state, is enjoyed by the simplest faith, and the more simple the more it is enjoyed.<a name=424:7></a> Christ dwelling in our hearts by faith is enjoyed by him in whom He dwells, not by him who can explain it, though it be true it must be enjoyed in order to be able to explain it.<a name=424:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But this humbling of Christ by Himself is divine love, and in exercise -- we know God by it.<a name=424:9></a> It is Himself in activity, yet in giving Himself up in this unspeakable way.<a name=424:10></a> In the Father God remains in essential Godhead; in the Son, one with Him in the exercise of it: coming down to serve, the Object in which we know God and see the Father.<a name=424:11></a> God is objectively before us in the Spirit power, operative power in us to be able to apprehend, and have the love shed abroad in our hearts so that we dwell in God and God in us.<a name=424:12></a>
