		In <a href="../bible/John.htm#8">John  8</a>the eldest had more reputation to save.<a name=1:4></a> The writing on the ground was in a certain sense a dignified contempt of their hypocrisy.<a name=1:5></a>

		In John, the Lord does not say, "You are sinners", but "Ye shall die in your sins", treating them as reprobates.<a name=1:20></a>

		Ques.<a name=2:1></a> What is the difference between hearing His voice and hearing His word?<a name=2:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the former there is the additional attraction of His Person.<a name=2:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Metaphysics never can be right, because if they bring God in, it is religion; and if they leave Him out it is nothing but folly.<a name=2:4></a>

		Ques.<a name=2:5></a> Do all Christians get all the rewards in the seven churches?<a name=2:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I suppose there will be a special sense of them given to those who have been faithful.<a name=2:7></a> All will sit upon His throne, though to me that is the lowest.<a name=2:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Reward is encouragement; if it is motive, it is wrong altogether.<a name=2:9></a> The crowns are all one to me, but different circumstances may bring out the characters; faithfulness to death has a crown of life, but all believers will get it.<a name=2:10></a>

		In <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#32:15">Isaiah  32:15</a>, "Wilderness be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be counted for a forest", means the total change of the whole thing.<a name=2:11></a> Verse 14 is judgment on Jerusalem.<a name=2:12></a>

		"Again a new commandment I write unto you", i.<a name=2:13></a>e.<a name=2:14></a>, this loving one another; it is no new thing, and yet it is, because you have it now as "true in him and in you".<a name=2:15></a>

		RYDE MEETING
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is no question at all now, whether a man can stand in the Day of Judgment by a certain course of living.<a name=3:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We live under the revelation that he cannot; Christianity begins with that revelation.<a name=3:2></a> We cannot stand before God; all the world has become guilty.<a name=3:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The law put man on probation, but when Christ came, the full evil of man's heart was brought out; he crucified the Lord of glory.<a name=3:4></a> And now we get the deeper apprehension that we are not only guilty but lost; lost as a present state.<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Guilt refers to the Day of Judgment, but there is, too, the actual condition.<a name=3:6></a> I am not only exposed to judgment but I am lost also.<a name=3:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then at the cross, when man's sinfulness was fully proved, the love of God was shewn out in the accomplishment of the work of his salvation.<a name=3:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The whole question of good and evil, perfect evil in man and perfect goodness in God, all was brought out.<a name=3:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The consequence was that man has gone into the glory of God.<a name=3:10></a> Jesus Christ sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high.<a name=3:11></a> That is where Christianity begins; it is with the full testimony of evil in man, and then I have another Man, who perfectly glorified God, and who is now glorified by God.<a name=3:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The mystery of the cross is this  --  that in that place where sin came out absolutely in full light before God, there, too, was the place of perfect obedience and full love towards God.<a name=3:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, this being accomplished, "if God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him", and the Son of man goes straight up into the glory of God.<a name=3:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There I get a new platform altogether, not with my responsibility in question, for on that ground I am lost as well as guilty; but there is a Man gone into the glory of God, so that I both know God in the perfectness of His love, and Man in the perfectness of God's righteousness.<a name=3:15></a> This is the starting point of Christianity; every thing is put on an entirely new basis.<a name=3:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then at Pentecost the Holy Ghost came down, and His presence on earth is the consequence of Man in the glory of God.<a name=3:17></a> Every direct operation of God was by the Spirit; "By

	<div class="paragraph">
		his spirit he hath garnished the heavens"; prophets spake by the Holy Ghost; demons were cast out by the Spirit of God; but all that is a very different thing from the Spirit's <i>coming</i>.<a name=4:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ made everything; but He did not come until the incarnation.<a name=4:2></a> He was there in one sense, but there was also a distinct personal coming.<a name=4:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the Holy Ghost has now come, and He dwells in a believer, and becomes the power of Christianity and characterises the Christian himself.<a name=4:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We now stand between the Holy Ghost sent down and the full result in glory.<a name=4:5></a> "He that hath wrought us for the self-same thing is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit", i.<a name=4:6></a>e.<a name=4:7></a>, He has wrought us for the glory, and has given us the earnest of it.<a name=4:8></a> That is where the Christian stands, and he is thereby associated with Christ in heavenly glory.<a name=4:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How can I know that I have the Holy Ghost?<a name=4:10></a> Do you fancy that God dwells in me, and I shall not find it out?<a name=4:11></a> I may not be able to explain it, but that is another thing.<a name=4:12></a> We cannot have it without knowing it.<a name=4:13></a> You must have a knowledge of Scripture to explain it, but there will be a consciousness of the fact in one's self, and there will be true liberty, too.<a name=4:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But then the life of Jesus is to be manifested in me, and there I get my proper responsibility as a Christian.<a name=4:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Since Christ appears in the presence of God for us, we are to appear in the presence of the world for Christ.<a name=4:16></a>

		A FEW DETACHED NOTES
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The moment the law said, "Thou shalt not lust", why you might as well tell me not to be a man.<a name=5:1></a> Even if my will is right -- the case supposed here -- yet I am in such a state that I cannot succeed in mastering the flesh.<a name=5:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then he learns that it is not he that does it, but the sin that dwells in him, and next he learns that it is too strong for him, and he cries, "Who shall deliver me?<a name=5:3></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is what a man must be brought to.<a name=5:4></a> Then he gets "in Christ Jesus", and that is a new place; the slave is free.<a name=5:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If I have a rogue in my house, and I trust him, he pilfers me at pleasure; but if I distrust him and lock things up, it may be unpleasant, but still, I am safe.<a name=5:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One word about forgiveness.<a name=5:7></a> There is what I should call an administrative forgiveness, but this was not known until Christ's coming.<a name=5:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		They did spell out of old about eternal judgment.<a name=5:9></a> But the Lord says, "That ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins", etc.<a name=5:10></a>, and He shews His competency to do it by saying, "Arise and take up thy bed and walk, go thy way into thine house".<a name=5:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You get no spiritual knowledge of what sin is in the Old Testament.<a name=5:12></a> I do not speak of sins, but of sin.<a name=5:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The keys of the church were not given to Peter; that is all a blind delusion.<a name=5:14></a> People say the kingdom of heaven and the church are the same thing, but it is all wrong.<a name=5:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a building which Christ is carrying on now, and which grows to a holy temple.<a name=5:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When you speak of succession, I see there is one, but then it is, "I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock".<a name=5:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Remember nobody else is Simon Bar-jonas but Simon Bar-jonas.<a name=5:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Two or three in Christ's name is God's succession; and no other is; apostolic if you like to call it, but God owns it.<a name=5:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I shall not want a conscience in heaven; it is positive infinite enjoyment there.<a name=5:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Priesthood is that they may behave well.<a name=5:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Advocacy is when they have not behaved well.<a name=5:22></a>
	</div>

		Priesthood is for mercy and grace to help.<a name=5:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=6>[Page 6]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Advocate is, if any man sin, we have one.<a name=6:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Advocacy is one fruit of propitiation.<a name=6:2></a> Priesthood keeps the heart in constant dependence.<a name=6:3></a> But in neither of these is there any question of imputation.<a name=6:4></a> You never find that <i>we</i> go to the priest; a Jew of old might.<a name=6:5></a> We go boldly to the throne of grace, because Christ is there in heaven for us; but that is not intercession.<a name=6:6></a> It is the priest now who is there, and the priest is connected with intercession, but intercession is not the exercise of priesthood, properly speaking.<a name=6:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=6:8></a> When does the Lord act as advocate, is it when a saint sins?<a name=6:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It does not say, if any man repent, and confess; but, if any man sin, we have an advocate.<a name=6:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=6:11></a> Then does nothing begin with us?<a name=6:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nothing but sin that I know of.<a name=6:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And confession is the effect of advocacy; but, remember, imputation is not in question.<a name=6:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=6:15></a> What do you mean by that?<a name=6:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I mean the charge of guilt upon a man's conscience.<a name=6:17></a> Hebrews gives you your standing before God, and there is no more conscience of sins.<a name=6:18></a> That is the scriptural doctrine; whereas, nowadays, nine-tenths of Christians could not tell you what that passage means.<a name=6:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are not Jews under law, or there would be imputation.<a name=6:20></a> If Christ has not put away all our sins totally and for ever, and absolutely, it never can be done.<a name=6:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=6:22></a> Does Hebrews contemplate failure?<a name=6:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Apostasy it does, not failure strictly.<a name=6:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=6:25></a> What is the difference between infirmities and sins?<a name=6:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ can be touched with the feeling of my infirmities, but He never had any sins, or any sympathy with them.<a name=6:27></a> I can get help for my infirmities, and in a sense can glory in them, but I could not in my sins.<a name=6:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two kinds of temptations; one is from without, all the difficulties of Christian life; Christ went through them and He has gone through more than any of us; but the other kind of temptation is when a man is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.<a name=6:29></a> Christ, of course, never had that.<a name=6:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You want the hatchet of Scripture for these latter; the word of God discerns the thoughts and intents of the heart, and so helps us in that way to go through the wilderness.<a name=6:31></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=7:1></a> How far ought unconfessed sin to affect a man's conscience?<a name=7:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He never can get a good one until he has confessed all to God.<a name=7:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The existence of the flesh in me does not give me a bad conscience; but the moment I let it act, that does.<a name=7:4></a> If you mingle the question of imputation with the sins of a saint, then it is no longer to you simply a question of holiness, but of righteousness and justification, and therefore you never judge sin really and thoroughly until you have got the certainty that nothing is imputed to you.<a name=7:5></a> The sense of sins and imputation is all quite right until you are justified -- the deeper you feel it the better.<a name=7:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But when I learn that Christ has borne all my sins in His own body on the tree, so that God must pass them over, and cannot impute them to me, for He sees the blood of Christ; then, if He were supposed to impute them to me, it would make Him disown that blood.<a name=7:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A person who raises the question of imputation does not know what it is to be justified.<a name=7:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=7:9></a> What is the difference between non-imputation and forgiveness?<a name=7:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If nothing could be imputed to a sinner, then there is no need for forgiveness.<a name=7:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When guilty, you are justified; when you have offended, you are forgiven; and when you are defiled, you are washed.<a name=7:12></a> If I look at guilt, I want justification; at offence, forgiveness; at defilement, cleansing.<a name=7:13></a>

		All is provided; God leaves no loophole for Satan.<a name=7:14></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have no more conscience of sins in virtue of the blood of Christ, but then that gives me a conscience of sin in my failure of holiness.<a name=7:18></a> A person in a dirty condition generally would think little of another spot; but if he is spick and span clean, he would think a great deal of the first spot.<a name=7:19></a>

		The first effect is what I have just said, that after the sacrifice, or, rather, the bringing of the ashes, no question can be raised as to imputation, and when I get my soul fully right, then comes the sense of superiority of grace to sin, so that I get back into communion.<a name=8:1></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is a more important question.<a name=9:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:47">Luke  24:47</a> you have that "repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem".<a name=9:2></a> There can be no question about that, but what has enfeebled preaching among ourselves and others is, there has been such a sense that repentance is preliminary to faith.<a name=9:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are all apt to topple over from one side to another, and so the true place of repentance has become obscured, and its presentation enfeebled.<a name=9:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is mischievous for the reason that the claim of God is left out or enfeebled by it.<a name=9:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God is now gathering His own in haste, if I may so speak; the Lord is coming, and woe be to us if we say He delays His coming.<a name=9:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God is gathering out hurriedly the joint heirs, and, as of old, so now it is, "save yourselves from this untoward generation"; that was when Jerusalem was going to be destroyed.<a name=9:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He now calls upon "all men everywhere to repent: <i>because</i> he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained".<a name=9:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Repentance is God's claim upon people, and if in preaching I merely say, 'God loves you, and you are a poor sinner, here is grace for you' (and that I surely would say), and then leave repentance out, it is leaving the man's conscience out.<a name=9:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=9:10></a> What is repentance?<a name=9:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The judgment we have passed upon ourselves, and all that we have done, and have been, in God's presence under grace.<a name=9:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Even now, as under grace, there may be a legal repentance.<a name=9:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But if it is put before faith, it unsettles the whole ground we stand upon before God; it is then something that I am doing in my own heart, and that won't do.<a name=9:14></a> When I preach repentance, therefore, I must preach it in Christ's name, and so I said, "under grace".<a name=9:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As I get to God, I see what I am in true light, more and more clearly every day.<a name=9:16></a> It is infinite love, that, where sin abounded, grace did much more abound; but if I carry God's message to others, I must carry God's claim, and I say, if you don't repent and turn to God, you will be lost.<a name=9:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=10>[Page 10]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Yet if I call on people to repent, in the name of Christ, they must believe in Christ in order to repent.<a name=10:1></a> As a man you have to say to God and what state are you in before God?<a name=10:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If your heart is not changed, what have you that is at all fit for God?<a name=10:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But if I call upon a man to be in God's presence with God's claim upon him, and that in grace -- perfect grace -- then if he returns, he returns to God.<a name=10:4></a> Repentance ought to be preached as God's claim upon man, but as putting in that claim in the Person of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=10:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God calls on all men to repent, but if they do not, they must come under judgment.<a name=10:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

		Ques.<a name=10:8></a> Why is mention made of the "morning star", in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2:28">Revelation  2:28</a>?<a name=10:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It shows that Thyatira is at midnight.<a name=10:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Thyatira there are two ways of judging; the one is what He begins with, and the other is the coming of the Lord.<a name=10:11></a> As in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#5">Isaiah  5</a>, God asks, "What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it; wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?<a name=10:12></a>" So He will break down its wall, and it shall be trodden down.<a name=10:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Or, take up Adam, and say, is that what God made you?<a name=10:14></a> Have you answered to it?<a name=10:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Whether it is the world, or Jews, or the church as a dispensation for the time, it can be judged so.<a name=10:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But on the other hand I can say, Christ is coming, are you ready for Him?<a name=10:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the three primary churches the Lord had spoken of the possibility of going back to the former condition, but to Thyatira (which I do not doubt gives us a true picture of Rome), He gives time to repent, and He says that she does not repent, so she is going to be punished, and therefore it is that this church is the first that goes down to the Lord's coming.<a name=10:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When you get the judgment of the whole body of the professing church as thus corrupt, then you have, "Hold fast till I come".<a name=10:19></a> The kingdom and the heavenly glory will then take the place of the corrupt church.<a name=10:20></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The end of the Revelation forms no part of the prophecy.<a name=11:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before He enters on prophecy, you get the Lord's coming and then, "Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, and hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever".<a name=11:4></a> Although earthly things are going to be spoken about, Christ's coming in grace calls out the church's feelings towards Himself.<a name=11:5></a>

		There were two trees in the garden of Eden, the tree of life and the tree of responsibility; man took of the latter, and is lost.<a name=12:1></a> The law takes up the same question, but it puts the accomplishing of the responsibility before the enjoyment of life.<a name=12:2></a> But when I come to Christ, I find Christ has met all the responsibility; that is settled, and life is given.<a name=12:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the Old Testament, wherever God wrought, the repentance was real, but they had no thought of asking, "What must I do to be saved?<a name=12:4></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The young man asked, "What shall I do to inherit eternal life?<a name=12:5></a>" The Lord in His answer does not say "eternal life", but, "This do, and thou shalt live".<a name=12:6></a> The law referred to particular acts, and they could go and get their consciences cleared, by a lamb, or a kid, or a goat; it was a general clearance for a need.<a name=12:7></a> But repentance in the Old Testament referred to the same thing as in the New.<a name=12:8></a>

		At this moment the new Priest is sitting at the right hand of the Father <i>until</i> His foes be made His footstool.<a name=32:5></a> And it is left at that, so that no one can tell when He will come forth fully as Melchisedec.<a name=32:6></a> But the Aaronic priesthood is set on one side; and people could not offer anything themselves -- could have nothing to say to God, except through the priesthood.<a name=32:7></a>

		Now in that we have been speaking of God was dealing with man upon the earth; He "spake on earth", He came down here into the tabernacle; God was on the earth and man looked at as living and responsible; therefore God says, "You cannot come near me".<a name=32:8></a> He placed a barrier round Sinai, and a vail in the tabernacle.<a name=32:9></a>

		Most interesting figures there were of things now revealed in Christianity, but man could not then draw near to God.<a name=32:10></a> God gave a law of ten commandments, and it was a perfect rule to man as alive in the flesh in this world.<a name=32:11></a> He took up the Jewish people for the purpose, but the whole nation turned to idolatry.<a name=32:12></a> What more could God have done for that nation than He did?<a name=32:13></a>

		All this supposes man to be alive on the earth -- the cross supposes man to be dead, while in another sense it brings in death to him.<a name=32:16></a> And it rends the vail as well.<a name=32:17></a> The law treated man as alive and responsible, but never as dead.<a name=32:18></a>

		Then God came into the world in Christ, and man would not have Him, but crucified Him.<a name=32:19></a> And in the death of Christ God was no longer a hidden God.<a name=32:20></a> Now death comes and says two things to me: if you are not a believer, you are dead; and, if you are a believer, you have died in Christ, and are now alive unto God in Christ.<a name=32:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Forty years ago there was nothing but the recognised systems, and so far the path was simple; but now, the idea of liberty to meet together is spread all over the country.<a name=37:8></a> Indeed, what they call the universal freedom of Christians as in the evangelical alliance is just on that ground, only they accept, in practice, the camp.<a name=37:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=37:12></a> What is the "camp"?<a name=37:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was an arrangement of religion for the world.<a name=37:14></a> In Israel, God raised that question for man as he was, and it could not be carried through.<a name=37:15></a> Then, as we know, God brought in His Son but He was rejected, and was taken up to heaven.<a name=37:16></a> God did spare the Jews, but as they rejected the testimony of Stephen, heavenly things were brought in; there was thus an end of the camp, i.<a name=37:17></a>e.<a name=37:18></a>, of God's owning it, for the cross had already put an end to it; then the supplementary grace through Stephen was refused, and he was put to death.<a name=37:19></a> This put an end to the camp, and you get the church formed with a heavenly character.<a name=37:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Gradually it gave up its heavenly character, and settled down to the earth, and became a camp.<a name=37:21></a>

		Most surely there was repentance in the prodigal; he says, "Make me as one of thy hired servants"; but there was no such thought in God's heart at all, though it is what the experiences of the prodigal bring him to.<a name=54:6></a> But his father meets him in all his rags -- the proofs of his profligacy are upon him; but until he met his father, he did not know his father's heart.<a name=54:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So we have nothing else to put on, we are all in rags.<a name=54:8></a> And after that you do not get one single word about what the prodigal son did at all.<a name=54:9></a> It is the Father says, "Let us .<a name=54:10></a>.<a name=54:11></a>.<a name=54:12></a> be merry", "Bring forth the best robe", and so on.<a name=54:13></a> That is just where we are with God.<a name=54:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Of course, we look for good fruit from all this; we ought to manifest the life of Christ in everything -- buying, selling, the counting-house, dress, everything.<a name=54:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Do <i>you</i> do all things in the name of the Lord Jesus?<a name=54:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If not, you are giving up Christ for some folly or other.<a name=54:18></a> If you cannot do the thing in <i>that</i> name, do not do it at all.<a name=54:19></a> The way the Lord walked was by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God.<a name=54:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The fact is, I am not alive in this world at all.<a name=54:21></a> (I don't mean physically, of course.<a name=54:22></a>) But Paul asks, "If ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, <i>as though living in the world</i>, are ye subject to ordinances?<a name=54:23></a>" As to my place in Christ, "The body is dead because of sin"; and again, I am "dead to the law by the body of Christ".<a name=54:24></a> I have no more to do with the world or its religion, for I have died.<a name=54:25></a> I have, of course, to go through what is of the world; Christ Himself did that.<a name=54:26></a>

		The Lord Himself give us to see the connection between living by faith and the clear apprehension of what salvation is; that it is not merely forgiveness, though that is the first thing, but also, the taking the believer out of the place he was in, in the first Adam, and the putting him into Christ the second Man, and seating him in the heavenly places in Him.<a name=54:27></a>

		Two questions have been put into my hand, one as to preaching repentance, and the other as to preaching the kingdom.<a name=55:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nobody questions as to whether people ought to repent; and as to the kingdom, Paul says to the elders from Ephesus in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20">Acts  20</a>"Ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God"; and you will find it elsewhere as well.<a name=55:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You have it in <a href="../bible/John.htm#3">John  3</a>, which is often overlooked, "Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God".<a name=55:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have no doubt it is an important point, too.<a name=55:4></a> Other things were preached, but it was testified by the prophet that God was going to set up a kingdom.<a name=55:5></a> When the Lord came, He, in a certain sense, preached nothing else.<a name=55:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to that point, at least, John Baptist and the Lord exercised the same ministry.<a name=55:7></a> It was testified then, and ought to be so still.<a name=55:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thing has come out -- the gospel of our salvation -- a thing that was not promised or spoken of before the cross; while there were the prophecies that Christ should come, the grace that should be brought had not appeared.<a name=55:9></a> There was a testimony to its appearing from Adam on, but the importance of the statement of the kingdom lies in this, that it is not simply persons must have a change in them in order to be happy, but that God was setting up something.<a name=55:10></a> God did not own the world at all, but was setting up a kingdom, into which a man could not enter, if he was not born again.<a name=55:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nowadays, Christianity is so reduced to the idea of being safe -- leading people to look into their own hearts to see if they are -- that the object of testimony is gone.<a name=55:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It has come down to this, a certain few outward things, and then there is nothing positive and substantial at all.<a name=55:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there were two testimonies; the Lord's own upon which He was condemned (He was not condemned on the testimony brought against Him, for the two false witnesses did not agree), and which before Pilate was that He was a King -- "Thou sayest that I am", that was the "good confession" that He witnessed; and the other testimony was that God was setting up a kingdom.<a name=55:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are other things, the church, and so on -- one of the great mischiefs done is the confounding of the kingdom and
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=56>[Page 56]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the church of God -- but still, the kingdom is there as the subject of preaching.<a name=56:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Matthew you get things brought out more in order, and there you get the rejection of Christ, and upon that, three things are substituted for what He was down here -- founded though upon His work -- the kingdom of heaven in chapter 13, the church in chapter 16, and the coming in glory, i.<a name=56:2></a>e.<a name=56:3></a>, the transfiguration, in chapter 17.<a name=56:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These are very distinct.<a name=56:5></a> You could not call the kingdom "the bride", or "the body of Christ"; there would be no sense in it.<a name=56:6></a> The setting up of a kingdom is seen in the authority of a king, and he has his subjects; but in the idea of a body, or of a bride, you can't talk of a king.<a name=56:7></a> If you do, you lose the whole idea.<a name=56:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The kingdom had been spoken of, and the Messiah was to come, but the church never at all.<a name=56:9></a> That was hidden from ages and from generations, but is now revealed.<a name=56:10></a> We have now the key to it.<a name=56:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may understand certain things, but it is declared that there was no kind of revelation of the church in the smallest degree, until Christ had come and died.<a name=56:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It would have upset all that God had revealed, for the wall of partition was not taken down before.<a name=56:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the kingdom was testified of; only, when the King came in Person -- Christ -- He was rejected, and so the personal thing was not set up, for the King was gone away to heaven.<a name=56:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He was rejected and taken up to heaven, nor does He sit upon His throne yet, but He says, "To him that overcometh will I give to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne", as had been said to Him, "Sit thou on my right hand till I make thine enemies thy footstool".<a name=56:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And presently in the Revelation it says, "We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned".<a name=56:16></a> And so He will reign, but those who are faithful to Christ own Him now as the true King, of course.<a name=56:17></a> There are other and better things for those who have believed, but His kingdom will be set up openly.<a name=56:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Say, as when Charles II was not in the country, those who were loyal owned him as the king, though he was in France.<a name=56:19></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When the time comes He will leave His Father's throne, and His kingdom will be set up.<a name=57:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Meanwhile you get the parables of <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13">Matthew  13</a>, giving the state of the kingdom during the absence of the King.<a name=57:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The devil is able to sow tares -- not in the church but in the world.<a name=57:5></a> It is clearly said, "the field is the world", and there the tares are sown; that is the devil's work, and he has done it plentifully.<a name=57:6></a> In the last three parables you get God's intention about it.<a name=57:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He took the world for the sake of the treasure; then, He is seen seeking goodly pearls; and lastly you come to that which has a certain analogy to the thought of the tares; they take a net and cast it into the sea, and it gathers of every kind; they put the good into vessels and cast the bad away.<a name=57:8></a> All that is the kingdom, while the King is no longer here.<a name=57:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The actual establishment of the kingdom in power is yet to come, but meanwhile, let Him at least gather those who are to reign with Him.<a name=57:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not yet the setting up of the kingdom, save in a mysterious way; but when He comes we shall be with Him upon thrones, for we are made kings and priests unto God and His Father.<a name=57:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#4">Revelation  4</a>it is said that the elders have twenty-four "seats"; the translators were afraid to say "thrones", it looked strange to put twenty-four symbols of saints on thrones, and so they put the word 'seats' instead, but it really is "thrones".<a name=57:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, if you want the kingdom in its manifestation in glory (which is not the highest thing), you get that in chapter 17.<a name=57:13></a>

		In all three gospels, it is the next week that the Lord takes the three disciples up and shews them Moses and Elias in the same glory with Himself upon the mount.<a name=57:14></a>

		He had said, "Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom", and thereupon the account of the transfiguration follows.<a name=57:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16">Matthew  16</a>Peter had said He was the Christ, the Son of the living God, i.<a name=58:8></a>e.<a name=58:9></a>, the King, of course, and the Lord charges them to tell no man that, but began to shew them that He must suffer, and be killed, and rise again the third day; and adds, that we must take up our cross and suffer with Him.<a name=58:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Six days after, He takes them up into the mountain; and of that, Peter tells us that it was the "power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ".<a name=58:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In Luke there is a difference.<a name=58:12></a> The cloud which came was, according to Peter, the excellent glory, and then the Father's voice came out of the excellent glory, and Moses and Elias go into it.<a name=58:13></a> Now that is not the kingdom, it is the better part, the Father's house.<a name=58:14></a> There was the revelation of the kingdom; and then glorified saints with and like Christ; and lastly those living on the earth.<a name=58:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The kingdom is set up in glory, in this vision of it, after the declaration that He could not be received as Christ.<a name=58:16></a> He ought to have been, but that was all over, and the Son of man must suffer.<a name=58:17></a> When ultimately He does come, and the kingdom is set up openly, He will gather out of it all things that do offend; and the righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.<a name=58:18></a> That is, I get the upper or heavenly part of the kingdom, separated like Luke's cloud; and the Son of man setting this earth right in the power of the kingdom.<a name=58:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		When Babylon -- the golden head -- was set up, God's throne was taken from the earth.<a name=59:3></a> Nebuchadnezzar took Jerusalem.<a name=59:4></a> God had been there in the cloud of glory between the cherubim, but that arises, goes to Mount Olives, and finally went away.<a name=59:5></a> Then the thrones of the four beasts were set up; and ever since that, it has been the government of the last beast.<a name=59:6></a> In His providence God has been working (I do not now speak of that or forget it), but all the beasts had already been brought out before the Lord Jesus Christ appeared on the earth.<a name=59:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Roman beast was then ruling in Jerusalem, and was joined with the Jews against Christ.<a name=59:8></a> "The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together" (as Herod and Pontius Pilate) "against the Lord, and against his anointed".<a name=59:9></a> They joined hands to reject God's King, and Christ testified to Pilate, that He Himself was God's King.<a name=59:10></a> So it has come about that the establishment of the kingdom in power is put off until the Lord comes again.<a name=59:11></a> When next He comes He will be "King of kings and Lord of lords".<a name=59:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Meanwhile, between Babylon and Infidelity all is now going on to judgment, as rapidly as ever it can.<a name=59:13></a> The will of man and the power of the beast are gathering strength every moment.<a name=59:14></a> But when Christ comes and establishes His kingdom, He will put down everything else; and He will have, if you look at <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>and <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8">Psalm  8</a>, a much wider dominion than anything Jewish.<a name=59:15></a> Those who repent when they see Him will be reigned over, but we shall reign with Him, because we own Him when He is not seen, and we get more than that, for we shall be <i>with</i> Him and <i>like</i> Him.<a name=59:16></a> The kingdom had been lost sight of, but it has begun to be preached again within my memory; meanwhile, God is gathering the joint heirs, and when all are gathered, the kingdom will come and the scene around us will be brought directly under the judgment of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=59:17></a>

		MEMORANDA FROM AN ADDRESS AT KENNINGTON, LONDON
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:14">Galatians  2:14</a> to the end.<a name=61:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This epistle, generally, deals with the fundamental principles of the gospel, i.<a name=61:2></a>e.<a name=61:3></a>, justification by faith, and another which I will speak of.<a name=61:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Galatians had received Judaism, and it was that which made the apostle stand in doubt about them.<a name=61:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But Christianity is the fullest revelation of God, first in the Person of the Lord Jesus Christ -- "He that hath seen me hath seen the Father"and in the work of the Lord Jesus, and then in the gift of the Holy Ghost which followed; the full revelation of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, i.<a name=61:6></a>e.<a name=61:7></a>, the Godhead fully revealed.<a name=61:8></a> And, now, "through him [i.<a name=61:9></a>e.<a name=61:10></a>, Christ] we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father".<a name=61:11></a> These are things which the angels desire to look into, elementary to Christianity though they are.<a name=61:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the world into which God has sent salvation is utter vanity; and the Lord Jesus Christ "gave himself for our sins, so that he should deliver us out of this present evil world"; a world indeed whose true character is brought out by Christ's coming into it, as He says, "O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me", and again, "Now is the judgment of this world".<a name=61:13></a> Our place is this, we are in a world which is in utter darkness from Christ having gone out of it ("The night is far spent"); it is here that we are, and it is here that we have this revelation of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.<a name=61:14></a> While Christ was in the world, He was the light of it, but the Light has now gone to a much brighter and more blessed scene.<a name=61:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Galatia, Judaising teachers had brought in the law, and it seemed plausible to insist upon it.<a name=61:16></a> But the law had power over a man only so long as he lived.<a name=61:17></a> Judaism belonged to this world, it was set up to try if man could walk with God in it.<a name=61:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Only God could not then reveal Himself to man.<a name=61:19></a> He dwelt in the thick darkness.<a name=61:20></a> Quite true His cloud filled the tabernacle, but what was the effect?<a name=61:21></a> Just this, that man could not

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord could pick out two words in it which went beyond this, but it was more contrast than likeness after all, shewing still that man could not be with God.<a name=62:5></a> It dealt with man on the earth, God saying, as it were, "I am behind the vail, and nobody must come near Me".<a name=62:6></a> Indeed that was so.<a name=62:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The law was provisional with its washings and carnal ordinances that enabled a man to have to say to God, while He was still behind a vail.<a name=62:8></a> Had God displayed His glory, they would all have been cut off in their sins.<a name=62:9></a> By means of sacrifices certain legal failures were met, so that the people might go on; but they were still in the world.<a name=62:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Under it there was a continual memorial of sins.<a name=62:11></a> Sins were not absolutely put away.<a name=62:12></a> It was thus a provision that intimated something better was to come; but the vail was unrent and the repetition of the sacrifices showed that the work was not done.<a name=62:13></a> It was grace in a provisional way only.<a name=62:14></a>

		Looked at simply and purely, the law is condemnation to everybody, for the blood of bulls and goats could not take away sins.<a name=62:15></a> It was a dealing with man as man down here, testing him.<a name=62:16></a> That was the great point of the law.<a name=62:17></a> It did not say that men were lost; it turned out they were, when they found it was spiritual, and they came to judge themselves; but they were under probation for our instruction while God was testing them.<a name=62:18></a>

		If He came into a world that was sinful, for His love He had hatred; His presentation among men was the last thing God could attempt, and, by itself, it only increased the sinfulness of man.<a name=63:4></a> All that passed in the midst of Judaism.<a name=63:5></a> By itself, His presentation would never have made a basis for Christianity, because there was no atonement made.<a name=63:6></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#12">John  12</a>, directly He takes the place of the Son of man, His widest title, He says, I must die or else I must abide alone.<a name=63:7></a>

		In His dying for us the foundation of Christianity was laid.<a name=63:8></a> He was "lifted up", not crucified on the earth, as He says, "Lifted up from the earth".<a name=63:9></a> He must be an entirely rejected Christ, and that unto death, or there could be no point of attraction for men.<a name=63:10></a>

		There were promises to the Jews and He was "minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers"; but man's sin must be thoroughly brought out; not merely his sins, but the state he is in.<a name=63:11></a> Sins were there, no doubt, plenty; and as God looks down upon the world, what does He see but corruption and violence?<a name=63:12></a>

		Now that the whole world has rejected the Son of God, its day of probation is over, so that it is said, "Once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself".<a name=63:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And yet in another sense, the end of the world has not come; but when you talk of God's dealings with man, as man in this world, it had come to an end.<a name=63:14></a> He could do no more for His vineyard than He had done, it was all of no use.<a name=63:15></a> Whether as without law, or as under law, or with Christ Himself among them, they would have God upon no terms whatever.<a name=63:16></a>

		It is a great thing for us, beloved friends, in all our path, to know where we are, and then to know the mind of God, not only as to where we are, but as to our own place in the path in which we find ourselves.<a name=68:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Not only has God visited us in grace, but we have to take into our own mind what the present actual result of the grace is that has reached us, so that we hold fast the great principles under which God has set us as Christians, and at the same time be able to apply those principles to the circumstances in which we find ourselves.<a name=68:2></a> These circumstances may vary according to our actual position, but the principles never vary.<a name=68:3></a> Their application to the path of faith may vary, and does.<a name=68:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I mean such a thing as this:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Hezekiah's time, they were told that "in quietness and confidence shall be your strength", and that the Assyrian should not even cast a mount before Jerusalem; they were to stay perfectly calm and firm.<a name=68:5></a> And the host of Assyria was destroyed.<a name=68:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But when, in Jeremiah's time, the moment of judgment had come, then he that went out of the city to their enemies, the Chaldees, should save himself.<a name=68:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		They were still God's people as much as before, though He was saying for the time (in judgment), "not my people", and that made the difference.<a name=68:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was not that God's mind was altered, or His relationship to His people changed; that never will be.<a name=68:9></a> Yet in the latter instance the conduct of the people was to be exactly the opposite.<a name=68:10></a> Under Hezekiah they were protected; under Zedekiah they were to bow to the judgment.<a name=68:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I refer to these circumstances as a testimony that while the relationship of God with Israel in this world is immutable, yet their conduct had to be the opposite at one time to that at another.<a name=68:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so <i>we</i> have to know where we are, and, at the same time, to learn what the path of God is in the position in which we find ourselves.<a name=68:13></a>

		But suppose I take the professing church now, including the Roman Catholic system and all else; if we look at that sort of thing and own it, at once we bow down to every thing that is evil.<a name=69:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Although God's thoughts never change and He knows His people, yet we need spiritual discernment to see where we are, and what the ways of God are in the circumstances, while never departing from the first great principles which He has laid down for us in His word.<a name=69:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have, too, to take account of another thing as a fact of Scripture: Wherever God has set man, the first thing man does is to spoil his position; we must ever take that into account.<a name=69:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Look at Adam, Noah, Aaron, Solomon, and Nebuchadnezzar.<a name=69:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		God goes on in patient mercy; yet the uniform way of man, as we read in Scripture, has been at once to upset and destroy the thing which God set up as good.<a name=69:6></a> Consequently, it is impossible that there can be any walking with a true knowledge of our position, if this is not considered.<a name=69:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But God is faithful, and goes on in patient love.<a name=69:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus, in Isaiah we find, "Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes", and so on; but it was not fulfilled till eight hundred years after; and when Christ came they rejected Him.<a name=69:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God waited in patience; individual souls were converted; various testimonies were rendered by the prophets, and a remnant was preserved still.<a name=69:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But if we should plead the faithfulness of God, which is invariable, in order to put a positive sanction upon the evil that man has brought in, our whole principle is false.<a name=69:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is exactly what they did in Jeremiah's time, when judgment was coming, and what Christendom is doing now.<a name=69:12></a> They said: "The temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, are these"; and, "The law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise", when they were all going to Babylon.<a name=69:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The faithfulness of God was invariable, but the moment they applied that to sustain them in the place of evil, it became the very ground of their ruin.<a name=69:14></a> If we lose the sense of where we

		We get the word, "Look unto the rock whence ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit whence ye are digged.<a name=70:2></a> Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bare you: for I called him alone, and blessed him, and increased him" -- a passage constantly misapplied.<a name=70:3></a> God is saying there, "Abraham was <i>alone</i>, and I called him".<a name=70:4></a> Israel, to whom God spake this, was then but a little remnant -- "Don't let that make you uneasy, I called Abraham <i>alone</i>".<a name=70:5></a> Their being little was of no consequence; God would bless them alone, as He had blessed Abraham.<a name=70:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, in Ezekiel, that is denounced as iniquity.<a name=70:7></a> There they said, "We are many"; "Abraham was one, and he inherited the land", God blessed him, and so He will bless us still more.<a name=70:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But we have to look at God's principles, and to the power of the Spirit of God; to hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches, and to discover truly where we are, so finding the path which God has marked out, and in which we are distinctly to walk.<a name=79:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We need also faith in the presence of the Spirit of God.<a name=79:6></a> The Spirit will use the Word, and make us take notice of the state of things, not confounding God's faithfulness with man's responsibility (what the superstitious world is doing), but owning that there is a living God, and that that living God is amongst us, in the Person and power of the Holy Ghost.<a name=79:7></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#3">1 Corinthians  3</a>the same thing is true of the church, "Ye are the temple of God".<a name=79:13></a>

		Again, it is only on the footing of redemption that God dwells with man.<a name=80:2></a> He did not dwell with Adam innocent, though He came down to Him; He did not dwell with Abraham, though He visited him and ate with him; but when Israel came out of Egypt, He says He brought them to himself "that I may dwell among them".<a name=80:3></a> At once the tabernacle was built, and there was God's presence in the midst of His people.<a name=80:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Of course, now, we have true and full redemption, and the Holy Ghost has come down to dwell in those who believe, that they might be the expression of what Christ was Himself when He was down here.<a name=80:5></a> "Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God", and, "hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit".<a name=80:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And further, in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2">1 Corinthians  2</a>, I find, "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.<a name=80:10></a> But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit".<a name=80:11></a> "We have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God".<a name=80:12></a> Now the Spirit of God and the world are always in contrast.<a name=80:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But then I find the revelation is in contrast with what is our state.<a name=80:14></a> We have to say, "Eye hath not seen".<a name=80:15></a> These things are so great; we can't conceive them, but God hath revealed them by His Spirit.<a name=80:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Taking the state of the Old Testament saints, they could not find out or know these things.<a name=80:17></a> But with us it is just the opposite.<a name=80:18></a> We do know them and He has given us His Spirit that we might know them.<a name=80:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this passage you get the Holy Ghost in three distinct steps: first, these things are revealed by the Spirit; next, they are communicated by words the Spirit taught; and then, they are received by the power of the Spirit, i.<a name=80:20></a>e.<a name=80:21></a>, they are

		ADDRESS AT THE EDINBURGH MEETING
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would just say a word as to obedience and dependence.<a name=82:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These are the elements of the new man, and they are exhibited in Christ Himself.<a name=82:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But until we have individually learnt ourselves, and come to the end of ourselves, we cannot walk in them.<a name=82:3></a> Even when there is in Christians an honest spiritual intention to be right, if self is not fully given up, the energy of self will mix itself in it, and produce failure.<a name=82:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If self is at work, there is no true guard against Satan's power.<a name=82:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will refer to one or two examples of what I mean.<a name=82:6></a> Take Moses.<a name=82:7></a> He gives up and refuses to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, taking his place with the people of God, slaves though they were.<a name=82:8></a> But he has no true self-knowledge, and so he kills the Egyptian; then he fears the first person that raises an outcry against him, and runs away.<a name=82:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Look again at Elijah.<a name=82:10></a> He takes true ground, owns the twelve tribes, is entrusted with full power by God, gathers the priests of Baal and has every one of them killed; but what then?<a name=82:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When Jezebel threatens him, he runs away and says, "Lord, they have slain <i>thy</i> prophets with the sword", when it was he himself who had been killing the others -- "and I am left alone".<a name=82:12></a> "Indeed you are not", says the Lord, "I have seven thousand left that have not bowed the knee to Baal".<a name=82:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Or take the case of Paul.<a name=82:14></a> You cannot find a more glorious example of grace than in him; but after having been taken up into the third heaven, Paul is in danger from the flesh, and is obliged to have a messenger of Satan to buffet him.<a name=82:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There must ever be the breakdown of self, not only the knowledge that we are sinners, but that we are without strength.<a name=82:16></a> Often we have not measured our weakness, and we go forward not thinking what it is, not suspecting it, but flesh is always weak in the things of God.<a name=82:17></a> The place of dependence is the place of power -- Christ's power.<a name=82:18></a> That is what we have to learn, and that, too, by a process that makes us find out what we are in ourselves, and thus divinely taught, it makes us sick of it also.<a name=82:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If you had put Paul into a fourth heaven, had there been one, it would only have been more dangerous still for him.<a name=82:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The revelation of grace does not help me if I am not in God's presence.<a name=83:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In 2 Corinthians you get two things put together; in chapter 1 Paul has the sentence of death written in himself; and in chapter 4 you have the way in which it was kept up, "Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.<a name=83:2></a> For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh".<a name=83:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul was constantly acting in view of the cross, so that flesh could not stir, and, on the other hand, to test it, God puts Paul through circumstances which so tested it in his case, that he despaired even of life, the effect being he received such strength that he could do all things.<a name=83:4></a> "Everywhere and in all things I am instructed", etc.<a name=83:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this is not merely I am dead with Christ, but the positive learning that self will not do.<a name=83:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thing, too, I would mention with reference to the utter hopelessness of all that man has built up, and that is, that true succession -- apostolic, if you like -- is found in "two or three" gathered together in Christ's name.<a name=83:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The power of binding and loosing -- discipline practically -- is by the word of God, connected not with a clergy, but with the assembly, wherever two or three are gathered.<a name=83:8></a> Of course it is merely administrative power, God alone can forgive absolutely.<a name=83:9></a> But administrative power was given to Peter, and then it was given to those who come after him.<a name=83:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God has provided everything for the church for all ages, and we have it, if we only take the word of God for our authority and guide.<a name=83:11></a> There is apostolic succession in the two or three.<a name=83:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The more difficult the times are, the more you find the word of God meets every thing.<a name=83:13></a> All sorts of things are arising, in these days specially, but the word of God is ready for all.<a name=83:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Since I was first exercised, I never found it fail me in any difficulty or heresy.<a name=83:15></a> I have failed it, that is another thing; but it has never failed me.<a name=83:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One thing more.<a name=83:17></a> We have looked at the failure but the present power is, the living God is with us; <i>MY</i> strength is made perfect in weakness, that is the character of our strength.<a name=83:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=84>[Page 84]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Where was the strength that destroyed Satan's power?<a name=84:1></a> It was the weakness of death, Christ's death, of course; He was crucified through weakness.<a name=84:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And it is the same principle with us.<a name=84:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When you look at man as man, his is a false strength, because he has departed from God.<a name=84:4></a> It is only evil.<a name=84:5></a> Such strength has to be broken down.<a name=84:6></a> I am satisfied we never fully get the sense of this, until it is actually broken down in us.<a name=84:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You may be converted and know the forgiveness of your sins, but until you have gone through the breaking down itself, you never know what the true character of your own energy is, but you are liable to fall and slip into it.<a name=84:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You see there is something to be done -- what then?<a name=84:9></a> <i>You</i> must go and do it.<a name=84:10></a> Ah!<a name=84:11></a> did God send you?<a name=84:12></a> That is another thing.<a name=84:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The soul that has learnt itself refers to God as the first thing; it distrusts the activity of its own will.<a name=84:14></a> If that is there, it is not obedience and dependence, though the soul may be very sincere at the same time.<a name=84:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will now say a word as to the present expectation of the Lord's coming at any moment.<a name=84:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		People who attempt to fix time are wholly mistaken.<a name=84:17></a> The Father has kept that in His own power.<a name=84:18></a> Not that we may not discern the times; the Lord says, "How is it that ye do not discern this time?<a name=84:19></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are moral elements around us that a spiritual mind discerns at once; but the fixing of dates is a mistake.<a name=84:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is no mistake to be always expecting the Lord to return.<a name=84:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The object of the conversion of the Thessalonians was to wait for God's Son from heaven.<a name=84:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		People fancy that the truth of the Lord's return is a bit of knowledge at the top of the tree; but instead of that, it is what the Thessalonians were converted for, and meanwhile they are to serve God.<a name=84:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		People say Paul made a mistake, but I can tell you he is going to get precious fruit from it when Christ comes again.<a name=84:24></a> He has to wait meanwhile, but that is no great loss, for "to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better".<a name=84:25></a> Yet the apostle himself did not know how to choose between the two, because if he went up there, he could not work for Christ down here.<a name=84:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The present constant expectation of Christ stamps its own character on the Christian: "Ye yourselves like unto men

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is by this that the Christian, in his mind and thoughts, becomes associated with Christ Himself.<a name=85:2></a> You find this specially in the letter to the church at Philadelphia, for there, besides keeping His word, and not denying His name, you read, "Because thou hast kept the word of my patience".<a name=85:3></a> Whose patience?<a name=85:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ's.<a name=85:5></a> Christ is waiting; and He is waiting a great deal more truly and earnestly than we are.<a name=85:6></a> We are waiting for Him, and He is waiting for us, with all the love that the Bridegroom bears to the bride.<a name=85:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		True, He is waiting until His enemies be made His footstool; but, for His friends, He has perfected His work; and He sits expecting as to His enemies, and then He will rise up to judgment.<a name=85:8></a> He does not know the time in that sense (of course, as God, He does) but it is not a revealed thing yet.<a name=85:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He is waiting, and we wait for Him, but so complete is the association, now in spirit, and then in glory, that save His personal glory, He cannot take any glory until He has us with Him for we are joint heirs with Him.<a name=85:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is blessed association with Himself that we find in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:8">Revelation  3:8</a> - 11.<a name=85:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first four churches you find the ecclesiastical order of things in the world closing with Thyatira which goes on "till I come".<a name=85:12></a> Thyatira ends entirely the whole moral history of the church of God until Christ comes.<a name=85:13></a> Consequently, you get there both the kingdom and the heavenly part of the saints.<a name=85:14></a> "He that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations: And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father".<a name=85:15></a> That is the kingdom according to the second Psalm.<a name=85:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"And I will give him the morning star"that is Christ according to the New Testament .<a name=85:17></a>.<a name=85:18></a>.<a name=85:19></a> .<a name=85:20></a> As soon as he says "morning star" in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:16">Revelation  22:16</a>, "The Spirit and the bride say, Come".<a name=85:21></a>
	</div>

		"Because thou hast kept the word of my patience", that was Christ's own path down here, and we are to walk in it now -- now that we are at the end of a dispensation, which, as an outward system, has wholly departed from God.<a name=86:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ down here had none of the things that belonged to Him.<a name=86:3></a> As a man, He simply lived by every word of God.<a name=86:4></a> He did not take up the pretension of power, but He walked in obedience, and that is just our place.<a name=86:5></a> And mark, they should, consequently, be kept "from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth".<a name=86:6></a>

		And first how can we get rid of this power of self?<a name=88:2></a> The end of <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2">Galatians  2</a>will introduce what I mean.<a name=88:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not take up now the question of righteousness by the law, but the question of the power of sin and self, which is sin really.<a name=88:4></a> Life is here made dependent on this great principle that "I am crucified with Christ".<a name=88:5></a> People talk of this as if it were a lingering death, but that is false doctrine, though they may mean it well.<a name=88:6></a> Paul says, "I <i>am</i> crucified with Christ", and then he looks upon himself as dead.<a name=88:7></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		They are all substantially the same thing, but different characters of it.<a name=97:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When you come to full Christianity, you see the Lord Jesus always walked and spake in this world as the Son of man who is in heaven; and though they made a great outcry about it, He was a heavenly Man.<a name=97:11></a> He was a true, real and heavenly Man down here.<a name=97:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

		Yes, it is the divine presence.<a name=97:21></a> It proves the unity of the two natures.<a name=97:22></a> That verse is strongly quoted against those who deny the Deity of Christ.<a name=97:23></a>
	</div>

		You cannot separate the glory in which Christ is from the actual holiness in which we ought to walk down here.<a name=97:24></a> The character of holiness is always the reflection of Christ in the glory.<a name=97:25></a> So, "We all looking on the glory of the Lord with unveiled face are transformed according to the same image from glory to glory".<a name=97:26></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1">1 Corinthians  1</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thing noticeable here is the distinction between the Church and the profession of Christianity, as shewn in the address of the epistle; it is, "unto the church of God, which is at Corinth, .<a name=113:1></a>.<a name=113:2></a>.<a name=113:3></a> called .<a name=113:4></a>.<a name=113:5></a>.<a name=113:6></a> saints" (not, called to be saints), "with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours".<a name=113:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the latter part, you have the calling on the name of the Lord Jesus, which is the character of one who professes to be a Christian; that is profession; whereas you get others before, distinctly as the assembly, and set apart, as saints by calling.<a name=113:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=113:9></a> Would that embrace the whole of profession?<a name=113:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Yes.<a name=113:11></a> He looks, no doubt, at all as sincere, and treats them as Christians, unless proved otherwise; still, you get these two characters, the church and the professing body; and I see that running all through the epistle.<a name=113:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=113:13></a> Does that bring out the responsibility of profession then?<a name=113:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That will follow.<a name=113:15></a> As you go through the epistle, I think he makes the thing most distinct; only remember that he assumes them to be Christians, unless proved to be otherwise.<a name=113:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=113:17></a> But he says, their Lord, and ours?<a name=113:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Precisely; that is the very thing.<a name=113:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=113:20></a> Profession and the church of God were, then, coincident?<a name=113:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		They were very nearly so.<a name=113:22></a> In the beginning, absolutely so; because the Lord added to the church such as should be saved, and He took care that it should be real.<a name=113:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=113:24></a> Would not the expression, "sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints", apply to all?<a name=113:25></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		No; or why should he make the difference?<a name=113:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=113:27></a> Is this the only epistle where the expression occurs?<a name=113:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So far as I know.<a name=113:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=113:30></a> Is it not, then, very remarkable, considering the state of things at that time?<a name=113:31></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Yes; and nowhere is it so clearly brought out as in 1 Corinthians.<a name=113:32></a> If you look at verse 8, he says, "Who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless" -- not merely safe,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=114>[Page 114]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		but blameless -- "in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ"; and then he sets about to blame them for everything.<a name=114:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=114:2></a> But what is the objection to considering the former part of the second verse as referring to the church at Corinth, and the latter part of it as extending to every true believer?<a name=114:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He does suppose all of them true, but He puts in another character besides that of the church, and "called saints".<a name=114:4></a> He addresses them not as the church, but as individuals.<a name=114:5></a> You get much the same distinction in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4">Ephesians  4</a>one body and one spirit; and then, one faith, one baptism.<a name=114:6></a> You get the one body clearly enough in our tenth chapter.<a name=114:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=114:8></a> Would the salutation of verse 3 apply to those who called upon the name of the Lord?<a name=114:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Yes; still, he makes a difference, and that with another title.<a name=114:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is one great point of instruction.<a name=114:11></a> Those who called upon the name of the Lord were, of course, in the assembly, as a general rule; yet the Spirit of God is providing for a day when the difference should be yet more developed, and so He uses that different title in Scripture in order to provide for the coming time, that the two things might be separate.<a name=114:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=114:13></a> In <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1">Ephesians  1</a>, it is to the "saints" and to the "faithful"; would you also see a difference there?<a name=114:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		No; except as he gives a specific character to them, and so he does in Colossians; <i>here</i> it is "saints, with all that", etc.<a name=114:15></a> In Ephesians and Colossians they are the same class of people, but he gives them a specific character, it is only emphatic there, after all.<a name=114:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		At Corinth, as a general rule, they are supposed to be real Christians; only, as was said just now, by separating the characters, he has left a statement which would apply wherever such characters went.<a name=114:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Jude, you distinctly get false brethren creeping in.<a name=114:18></a> I do not think we have any idea how provisional everything is until the Lord comes.<a name=114:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first man was provisional; but it was the Second Man in whom all was to be settled; and so it is, I believe, with the church.<a name=114:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another thing to notice, and that is, "Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father", (one Father), "and from the Lord Jesus Christ".<a name=114:21></a> Practically, the Lordship of Christ is overlooked; it is the common address of the epistles, only it is lost sight of in Christendom.<a name=114:22></a>

		<a name=115>[Page 115]</a>

		Ques.<a name=116:15></a> One of the great errors of the Corinthians was their reasoning from the possession of gifts, through the Holy Ghost, to claiming a freedom in the use of them without responsibility?<a name=116:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Yes; and I see moderns now taking the same ground, though the Holy Ghost set it aside long ago.<a name=116:17></a>

		Only it goes much further; that is the way of its coming in, but not the way of its going out.<a name=116:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You get the coming in of it in Jude, and its going out in John, and there they deny everything.<a name=116:21></a> John says, "They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us".<a name=116:22></a> That is the full character of apostasy, openly leaving us; but that goes a long way beyond Jude.<a name=116:23></a>

		They did not absolutely separate themselves in an outward way, because they were "spots in your feasts of charity"; but they set up to be something like the Pharisees.<a name=117:8></a> Now in John, not only had they gone out, but they denied the Father and the Son, and also, that Jesus is the Christ.<a name=117:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is public infidelity after profession.<a name=117:10></a> A Pharisee set up to be a superior kind of Christian, and then he shewed his superiority by licence; of course, among the Jews, it was to be a better kind of Jew.<a name=117:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Not necessarily; though very often they might have it at the end.<a name=117:14></a> In Corinthians, they brought their suppers, too, that poor and rich might be together at what we call a tea-meeting; a very nice thing in its proper place; only, in Corinth, we find they began to abuse it, and then the two were disconnected by authority; <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11:33">1 Corinthians  11:33</a>, 34.<a name=117:15></a>

		NOTES ON THE REVELATION
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we look at the Book of the Revelation generally, we shall see its division into three parts: --
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first part, we find not so much the divinity or the humanity of Christ, as His personal or official glory (chapter 1).<a name=126:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the second part, we see Christ judging the seven churches (chapters 2 and 3).<a name=126:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the third part, we have that which takes place after the church has been removed (chapters 4 - 22).<a name=126:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the addresses to the seven churches, it is interesting to note that what is taken up by the Spirit of God is so presented that there should be nothing to check the expectation of the Lord's return at the time these letters were written, and still less so now.<a name=126:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so elsewhere.<a name=126:5></a> When the Spirit of God speaks of the Bridegroom not tarrying, He takes the things then present, and uses them as existing on to the end.<a name=126:6></a> It is so in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#25">Matthew  25</a>, where the same virgins go to sleep and awake; and in the parable of the talents, the lord, at his return, requires at the hands of the same servants that with which they had been entrusted at the first.<a name=126:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And thus it is in the seven churches.<a name=126:8></a> The evils seen therein at the end were there at the first.<a name=126:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=126:10></a> Does that shew a cumulative responsibility?<a name=126:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not doubt it does.<a name=126:12></a> All the blood shed from Abel to Zacharias was to be required of that generation; <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#11:51">Luke  11:51</a>.<a name=126:13></a> And in Babylon was found the blood of all that had been slain upon the earth; <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#18:24">Revelation  18:24</a>.<a name=126:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		After the seven churches, we find that which characterises the Book of the Revelation generally is the throne.<a name=126:15></a> In chapter 4: 2, "A throne was set in heaven", and in chapter 1: 4, it is grace from before His throne.<a name=126:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=126:17></a> What is meant by "to come", in that verse?<a name=126:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It does not refer to futurity of time, but to the coming One.<a name=126:19></a> "Which is", i.<a name=126:20></a>e.<a name=126:21></a>, exists; "which was", i.<a name=126:22></a>e.<a name=126:23></a>, has been revealed in time; and "is to come", i.<a name=126:24></a>e.<a name=126:25></a>, the coming One.<a name=126:26></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

		In chapter 4, the throne is that of <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#7">Daniel  7</a>, but with a larger development.<a name=127:1></a> It is not simply for judgment or government, for we find seraphim as well as cherubim.<a name=127:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=127:3></a> What is the special difference between the two?<a name=127:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A cherub is the instrument of God's judicial power upon earth; like the cherubim which stopped the way to the tree of life; <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#3">Genesis  3</a>.<a name=127:5></a> But in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#6">Isaiah  6</a>, we find the seraphim, and there it is, not merely a throne governing in respect of responsibility but, God revealed in His own character; and so the seraphim cry, "Holy, holy, holy"; this was to bring man as man into God's presence, whether clean or unclean, and it goes right beyond Israelitish government.<a name=127:6></a> It was government, but as having respect to God's own nature in its holiness, and hot merely to the particular revealed ways in which God dealt with Israel.<a name=127:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You do not find God saying to Israel, "I will punish you with the Assyrian"; but it was according to the terms in which He had made a covenant with them.<a name=127:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And it is so with us now.<a name=127:9></a> As life and incorruptibility are brought to light by the glad tidings, so God's wrath is "revealed from heaven against <i>all</i> ungodliness and unrighteousness of men".<a name=127:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the seraph, then, we have, not exactly the executioner of governmental power, but the nature of God coming out.<a name=127:11></a> All this is seen in the living creatures; they are cherubim, but with the attributes of God; the heads of creation are also seen in them (which is cherubic), man, lion, bullock, eagle, and they are here used as symbols of the throne of judgment.<a name=127:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Observe that, in this connection, we have nothing to do with the name of "Father"; the names used being those of the Old Testament; neither in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#6">Isaiah  6</a>is there anything to do with grace.<a name=127:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Cherubim are thus indicative of the government of God upon earth; seraphim, of His nature.<a name=127:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We find them both in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#4">Revelation  4</a>, where the living creatures are of cherubic character, but crying, "Holy, holy, holy".<a name=127:15></a> Seraphim, means, "burners".<a name=127:16></a>

		They are the pillars of the throne; in the Psalms we read, "He sitteth between the cherubim".<a name=128:4></a> These same creatures are found in Ezekiel, and God is sitting on the top of them.<a name=128:5></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Up to this time it is in subjection to the angels, but here no longer so; and we pass from angelic authority into saint authority.<a name=128:13></a> There are no angels in chapter 4, but in chapter 5, beasts and elders, and angels, worship together.<a name=128:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thing that strikes me is, that you never get angels giving a reason for their worship, but the elders, i.<a name=128:20></a>e.<a name=128:21></a>, saints, do say why they worship.<a name=128:22></a>

		<a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#16">Deuteronomy  16</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There were three great feasts when all Israel had to go up to Jerusalem.<a name=158:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Other feasts there were, such as the Sabbath constantly, the new moons, and the great day of atonement; but these three, the Passover, Pentecost or Feast of Weeks, and the Tabernacles, were solemn feasts in this way, that they were the gathering times of the people who all had to go up to keep them.<a name=158:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We shall see that whilst, in the bringing of the people thus together before God, there is a thought common to all, each of them has a different character.<a name=158:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As is well known, we have a distinct antitype to two of these feasts: "Christ our passover is sacrificed for us", and, "When the day of Pentecost was fully come"; but of the Feast of Tabernacles we have had no antitype, i.<a name=158:4></a>e.<a name=158:5></a>, there has been no fulfilment of it.<a name=158:6></a> The true Passover has been sacrificed, but the great gathering of the Feast of "Tabernacles" has yet to come; people will then own Christ to be their Passover, who will not have done so hitherto.<a name=158:7></a> That is, however, still future.<a name=158:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there are important features for us in these three feasts.<a name=158:9></a> Notice that Pentecost is in immediate connection with the unleavened bread rather than with the Passover.<a name=158:10></a> It was then that they offered the first of the first-fruits, type of Christ risen from the dead; and from the time of putting the sickle to the corn, they counted seven weeks, i.<a name=158:11></a>e.<a name=158:12></a>, typically, to the Church at Pentecost.<a name=158:13></a> On the day of the first-fruits they offered ears of corn without leaven; but seven weeks later, when the first-fruits were offered, leaven was put in the two cakes, because there the Church was, in type, offered to God.<a name=158:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But they could not be burnt at all.<a name=158:15></a> Our bodies are offered <i>to</i> God, but they are not like Christ -- a sinless, unleavened victim.<a name=158:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#2">Leviticus  2</a>gives us this more fully; there, they were to take fine flour, mingled with oil, and anointed with oil, and so on.<a name=158:17></a> That is Christ without leaven or honey; no sinful nature and no sweetness of nature could be allowed in sacrifice.<a name=158:18></a> In Christ, there was no leaven and no honey, nothing but the perfectness set forth in the oil and frankincense.<a name=158:19></a> "Mingled with oil" -- "that holy thing which shall be born of thee"; then, "anointed with oil" -- Jesus of Nazareth anointed

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"with the Holy Ghost and with power".<a name=159:1></a> In the end of the chapter, we find the oblation of the first-fruits offered to the Lord.<a name=159:2></a> Salt was to be offered with all their offerings, that is the separative power of holiness as consecrated to God.<a name=159:3></a> The Lord refers to it in <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#9">Mark  9</a>-- the separative power of holiness by the Spirit of God.<a name=159:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there was a meat-offering of green ears dried by the fire; this typified Christ offered up in His perfectness, and with only sweet savour coming out of the sacrifice.<a name=159:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in the case of the two cakes of the first-fruits, a sin-offering was offered with them, which met the question of the presence of the leaven.<a name=159:6></a> The two cakes were first offered with seven lambs for a burnt-offering, i.<a name=159:7></a>e.<a name=159:8></a>, Christ in pure perfectness; then came the sin-offering as meeting the leaven, "if <i>we</i> say that <i>we</i> have no sin, we deceive ourselves".<a name=159:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But let us turn to the character of the Passover.<a name=159:10></a> This was first held when Israel was coming out of Egypt, and for seven days they were to eat unleavened bread.<a name=159:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is also one of the feasts in <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#23">Leviticus  23</a>; and in verse 10, you have the time of the first offering of the wave-sheaf -- "When ye be come into the land", etc.<a name=159:12></a>; and it was to be waved on the morrow after the Sabbath.<a name=159:13></a> That was, in type, when Christ was raised from the dead.<a name=159:14></a> Seven weeks later on, the wave-loaves were offered.<a name=159:15></a> The coming of the Holy Ghost at Pentecost connects itself entirely with this new place of man, and the church is viewed in the wave-loaves.<a name=159:16></a> In Christ is seen the new place of man in resurrection.<a name=159:17></a> After He had been "made sin" for us; after death; after the judgment of God had been passed upon Him, God raised Him from the dead.<a name=159:18></a> Having perfectly glorified God as to the wickedness of man, Christ is <i>then</i> raised from the dead; and now, consequently upon what Christ has done, man is in a wholly new place before God.<a name=159:19></a> It is a new state and place altogether.<a name=159:20></a> Lazarus came back into this world; but this is, in Christ, a totally new state; The responsible man having failed, God has met that failure in the death of Christ; He then raises Christ from the dead, and thus puts man into a totally new condition altogether; death hath no more dominion over Him, for He is in a place which is the result of having perfectly glorified God.<a name=159:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is where Christianity begins.<a name=159:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The offering of the first-fruits introduces this, and the Feast of Pentecost is connected with the first-fruits, i.<a name=159:23></a>e.<a name=159:24></a>, seven weeks

	<div class="paragraph">
		from that day; and the coming of the Holy Ghost likewise connects us with Christ in that new condition.<a name=160:1></a> This is what I would press upon you.<a name=160:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You may turn to what was in the Passover, where man as man is a judged and condemned race.<a name=160:3></a> But the pride of man is such that he refuses this, and seeks to restore himself as he is.<a name=160:4></a> They make Christ coming into the condition of the children of Adam, as if it were to raise up men as men.<a name=160:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is all false.<a name=160:6></a> On the contrary, it is a totally new place altogether into which Christ has entered.<a name=160:7></a> It is all over with the world, and God has proved His righteousness in setting Christ at His own right hand.<a name=160:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The righteousness of the Father has come out.<a name=160:9></a> As the Lord says, "O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee, but I have known thee".<a name=160:10></a> The righteousness of God has been proved, not only in resurrection, but in setting Christ at His right hand.<a name=160:11></a> The world had cast Him out and slain Him.<a name=160:12></a> There where we find the fruit of righteousness, is in a Man sitting at the right hand of God.<a name=160:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God does not wait until the future when His Son shall come in the glory of the kingdom, but now already, in virtue of Christ having glorified God in the place of sin, there is a Man at the right hand of God.<a name=160:14></a> Man's malice, Satan's power, God's judgment, and God's love were all made manifest at the cross.<a name=160:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God has thus been perfectly glorified as to everything.<a name=160:16></a> He has been glorified in infinite love.<a name=160:17></a> Resurrection, now, is the first grand thing.<a name=160:18></a> Christ has been raised again for our justification.<a name=160:19></a> But God's answer to His work was not complete until He had set Him at His right hand in glory.<a name=160:20></a> There is now man in a new state altogether, consequent upon death and judgment having taken place.<a name=160:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All was settled at the cross.<a name=160:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I was one of the poor sinners who brought Christ there; but now I am not in the flesh at all; I am in Christ where He now is.<a name=160:23></a> My place and state is no longer that of a child of Adam.<a name=160:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		For the old thing there was no remedy.<a name=160:25></a> It was tried without law, and under law, and by prophets.<a name=160:26></a> Stephen sums it up when he says: "You have broken the law, killed the prophets, crucified Christ, and resisted the Holy Ghost".<a name=160:27></a> That drew out their enmity; they stoned him; he went to heaven.<a name=160:28></a> That is the historical beginning of the new thing.<a name=160:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I still press is, that it is man in a totally new state as

	<div class="paragraph">
		to his place with God.<a name=161:1></a> But we have not yet got this as regards our bodies.<a name=161:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now let us turn and look at the state of soul connected with this.<a name=161:3></a> In the Passover you will see this state of soul.<a name=161:4></a> There was to be no leavened bread, nor were they to eat any for seven days.<a name=161:5></a> Bread of affliction was connected with it.<a name=161:6></a> If you look at holiness, which you must have, is it not the bread of affliction for you?<a name=161:7></a> Without holiness, no man shall see the Lord, but alas!<a name=161:8></a> I am not holy.<a name=161:9></a> The unleavened bread of sincerity and truth is connected with affliction.<a name=161:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then mark another thing connected with the Passover in <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#16:7">Deuteronomy  16:7</a>: "And thou shalt cook and eat it at the place which Jehovah thy God will choose; and in the morning shalt thou turn and go unto thy tents".<a name=161:11></a> No communion, no joy, no fellowship -- not a bit.<a name=161:12></a> Unleavened bread is the bread of affliction.<a name=161:13></a> They were saved, but that is all, taking it as a present thing.<a name=161:14></a> They were a people in bondage and slavery, and God was going by as Judge; but the passover-blood shut God out from them, I mean, the blood on the doorposts.<a name=161:15></a> How can I escape judgment, for God must have holiness, and I have none?<a name=161:16></a> Well, there is the blood, and God will not come near me, and so it is the bread of affliction.<a name=161:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Conscience is always individual.<a name=161:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Many a true soul finds his happiness in the contrast between what he has got out of, and where he has got to.<a name=161:19></a> And what has he got into?<a name=161:20></a> Into the wilderness.<a name=161:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is constantly the case; the blood saved them from God's judgment, and that was all.<a name=161:22></a> Are there not many in that state?<a name=161:23></a> He sees he is ruined in Egypt, and that God is here as a Judge; that is the way he thinks of God, and the blood-shedding has met him in that state, and he is safe.<a name=161:24></a> I am glad he is.<a name=161:25></a> Look at the hymns that are sung, and where do you find anything more than the simple fact that I have got out from the ruin?<a name=161:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But conscience and justification must be individual; so they had to go to their tents and remain there.<a name=161:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The condition of many a soul is that of merely looking to get safe out of Egypt when God is acting as a Judge in respect of sin.<a name=161:28></a> Many true believers, alas!<a name=161:29></a> are not clear that God as a Judge does not now reach them in their sins.<a name=161:30></a> They certainly have no Pentecost, and still less have they any Tabernacles.<a name=161:31></a> They go to their tents, so to speak, where God is to them only

	<div class="paragraph">
		Having drunk that dreadful cup, and having glorified God as to sin on my behalf, Christ has entered heaven as my Forerunner; and the presence of the Holy Ghost on earth, indwelling me, is what associates me with Christ where He now is at the right hand of God, and unites me to Him also.<a name=162:6></a> So that if death itself come, it is gain to me.<a name=162:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The sufferings of Christ are over, and He has entered into the glory as Man in consequence; and now what?<a name=162:14></a> The Holy Ghost is given to us, and we know our relationship; as the Lord Himself declared it, saying, "I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God".<a name=162:15></a> The babes in Christ know the Father; they cry, "Abba, Father"; but it is not until they have received the Holy Ghost.<a name=162:16></a> "Ye are all God's sons by faith in Christ Jesus", and, "because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father".<a name=162:17></a> "Ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father".<a name=162:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>, the Lord says that, "in that day" i.<a name=162:19></a>e.<a name=162:20></a>, when the Holy Ghost is come, "ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you".<a name=162:21></a> We shall <i>know</i> it, that is what He says.<a name=162:22></a>

		The Lord had been warning the world in the previous part of this chapter.<a name=168:1></a> There was the folly of those who sought their pleasure and comfort in it; and He says: "Seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added unto you.<a name=168:2></a> Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom".<a name=168:3></a>

		Now what distinguishes the Christian is this, that by the revelation of what is not seen, he is borne up out of this world altogether.<a name=168:4></a> He has, of course, to pass through it, but, as a Christian, he does not belong to it at all.<a name=168:5></a> "They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world".<a name=168:6></a> Redemption being accomplished, this gives us a title, like the poor thief, into Paradise; but even so, we are strangers here, as in Hebrews, and we seek a country.<a name=168:7></a> There is nothing settled or established in this world; from the very beginning, its spirit has been that of seeking rest, whereas God, in judgment of it, has made us strangers.<a name=168:8></a>

		It was all over with Cain, and as God said to him, and as he also said, he was to be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth.<a name=168:9></a> He declared he was made a vagabond, and then he went and built a city in the land of Nod, i.<a name=168:10></a>e.<a name=168:11></a>, vagabond.<a name=168:12></a>

		Sin had made man a stranger to the Paradise of God, and so man sought to make for himself a rest.<a name=168:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But God said to Christ, "Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool".<a name=169:13></a> And the Lord Jesus Christ, rejected by man, is sitting at God's right hand as Man, expecting until His enemies are made His footstool.<a name=169:14></a> Patient grace is working meanwhile to call sinners to a knowledge of the salvation which He has wrought.<a name=169:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		First, He came to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself; and then, "Unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation".<a name=169:16></a> But that will surely be judgment for those who have rejected Him.<a name=169:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This is simple and clear; they searched their own prophecies, and they found that the grace they spoke of was not for them, but for us.<a name=170:3></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But on the day of Pentecost He did come to all them that had believed.<a name=171:2></a> There we have the Christian position.<a name=171:3></a> God had prophesied before of it, but God's word is a different thing from the accomplishment of the fact.<a name=171:4></a> Looked at as promises, "Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers".<a name=171:5></a> But there is more than that, He was the Object of the promises.<a name=171:6></a>

		So that if my sins brought Christ to the cross, the consequence of it is that they are all put away.<a name=171:14></a> He "bare our sins in his own body on the tree".<a name=171:15></a> If I go to God and acknowledge that my sins brought Jesus there, under His holy judgment, then they can never bring me there.<a name=171:16></a> The whole thing is completely finished, not merely for lawless people, not merely for lawbreaking people as the Jews (and practically many people are now under the law), but God has stepped in, and settled the whole question of sin.<a name=171:17></a> Christ has come into this world and died, God manifest in flesh, so that I might be able to trust God in love, that I might say: Though I cannot trust man in the world, he is so vile, I can trust God who sent His Son; Christ has wrought such a work that He Himself who did it is at the right hand of God in righteousness.<a name=171:18></a> Here is the fact; it is not a promise.<a name=171:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		You have man here in absolute (it is hard to say perfect) wickedness, together with Satan having complete power over the world, getting rid of the Son of God; and though they hated Him without a cause, yet He goes through all in perfect obedience, shewing thus absolute perfection in Man.<a name=172:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		At His first coming, He died, was raised again, and was glorified in virtue of what He had done.<a name=173:16></a> All was finished first of all, and then the Holy Ghost came down.<a name=173:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ, who bore my sins, is now as Man, at the right hand of God in glory, and down here, the Holy Ghost is the witness that He is there.<a name=173:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is our place, and, through the Holy Ghost we have received, comes the knowledge of that perfect love of God in which He did not spare His own Son.<a name=173:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What this accomplishes, then, is this: it puts me in the place where Christ is, and therefore, even from John the Baptist's father, we learn it was "to give knowledge of salvation unto his people".<a name=173:20></a> It is by the Holy Ghost that this knowledge comes; and I know that Christ is at the right hand of God, and also that He it is who bore my sins; if the work had not been complete, finished, accepted, He could not have been there, but it was <i>God</i> who raised Him from the dead.<a name=173:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=174>[Page 174]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And, the Holy Ghost given, that is where it puts those who believe.<a name=174:1></a> It is given to believers, i.<a name=174:2></a>e.<a name=174:3></a>, it is only the portion of those who do believe.<a name=174:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is the presence of the Holy Ghost which gives me the consciousness of the place I am brought into.<a name=174:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here I get infinite, perfect love; for God gave His Son to be a man, and He died for me that I might be in glory; and He told me, when risen, "I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God and your God".<a name=174:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		'We are all the sons of God by faith in Jesus Christ'.<a name=174:7></a> That is the force of those words in John, "To them gave he power to become the sons [or the children] of God".<a name=174:8></a> Then again, "Because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father".<a name=174:9></a> It is my place through Christ's work, and the Holy Ghost has given me the consciousness of it, for God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into my heart.<a name=174:10></a> I cannot call a man 'Father' if I do not know whether I am his child or not.<a name=174:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then I learn another thing by the Holy Ghost dwelling in me, and that is, I know that I am in Christ; that, of course, is perfect acceptance.<a name=174:12></a> "At that day" -- i.<a name=174:13></a>e.<a name=174:14></a>, when the Comforter is come, for they could not know it until then -- "ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you", <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>.<a name=174:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		People say, you cannot know; but the Lord says, "Ye shall know".<a name=174:16></a> Who am I to believe?<a name=174:17></a> "Ye in me, and I in you".<a name=174:18></a> Well, then, I know I am in Christ, and that is perfect acceptance.<a name=174:19></a> You must condemn Christ in glory, if you condemn the believer, for He is in Christ.<a name=174:20></a> The Spirit is given to us that we may know Christ is in the Father, "and ye in me, and I in you".<a name=174:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"But if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin: but the Spirit is life because of righteousness".<a name=174:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I get perfect acceptance, and, with it, the character of responsibility; we are the epistle of Christ.<a name=174:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It does not say, ye are to be, but ye <i>are</i> the epistle of Christ; and the world ought to read Christ in you, as they might read the ten commandments on the two tables of stone.<a name=174:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Mark, it is not responsibility as to our acceptance; we <i>are</i> in Christ; but if that is true, the other side is also true.<a name=174:25></a> "Walk worthy", therefore, "of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory".<a name=174:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another character of responsibility in Ephesians: "Walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called".<a name=175:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now God, the Lord, and the Spirit are thus to be the measure of what suits us in this world.<a name=175:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thing: "He that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God".<a name=175:5></a> There is no need of taking us on the side of conscience: "Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God".<a name=175:6></a> There I find what constitutes the Christian; the foundation is in Christ; the body of the Christian "is the temple of the Holy Ghost, .<a name=175:7></a>.<a name=175:8></a>.<a name=175:9></a> which ye have of God"; and so, "after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession".<a name=175:10></a> Having been washed from my sins by the blood of Christ, the Holy Ghost makes my body His temple.<a name=175:11></a> That is the Christian position consequent upon redemption; it is the Christian place, and thus I have to walk as Christ walked.<a name=175:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Forty days after His resurrection, the Lord ascended, and then He sent the Holy Ghost down here to dwell in those who believe, "whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you".<a name=175:13></a> We know that He does dwell in us because we cry, "Abba, Father".<a name=175:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We look to Christ, and we know we are in Him; but the presence of the Holy Ghost is what characterises the Christian, not, of course, in his inconsistencies, but as a Christian.<a name=175:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost, and you are bought with a price, how, then, can you go and sin?<a name=175:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The believer is left here in this world as the epistle of Christ, and the life of Jesus is to be manifested in him.<a name=175:17></a> This is his responsibility.<a name=175:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He knows his place; he cries, "Abba, Father"; the love of God is shed abroad in his heart; and he knows his relationship with God.<a name=175:19></a> He is in Christ, who is sitting at the right hand of God, while the Holy Ghost dwells in Him as His temple.<a name=175:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ being in me, my business now is to shew out Christ down here, and it is my privilege to suffer with Him.<a name=176:1></a> Having the Spirit of Christ in me, I cannot pass through a world of degradation, and sin, and misery without feeling in some real measure what is the scene through which I am passing, and what is its opposition as well as its character.<a name=176:2></a> Thus, having received the Holy Ghost, the Christian passes through the world as not being of it, and as having his conversation (i.<a name=176:3></a>e.<a name=176:4></a>, living associations) in heaven.<a name=176:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ "gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world", and so I am called to pass through this world; supposing Christ had been crucified last night, well the question is, am I going on with the world that crucified Him, or am I going on with Him?<a name=176:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again; I must have the Holy Ghost to know that I am accepted with joy.<a name=176:7></a> I cannot look up and say, "Even so, come", unless I know that my redemption is settled; and then I find that Christ is all, and in all; He is everything to us as Object, and He is in all as the power of life and joy.<a name=176:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having washed me from my sins in His own blood, He has become everything to my soul.<a name=176:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I cannot find a thing in Christ the value of which has not been spent upon me.<a name=176:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let me remark one thing here, and that is, that we know whom we love if we do not love Him enough.<a name=176:11></a> If anyone says, "I love my mother, and I think I love her enough", I say, "You wretch, you do not love her at all".<a name=176:12></a> But if a child says, "Oh, I do not half love my mother, for all her care, and painstaking, and labour for me", I say, that child does love its mother.<a name=176:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So it is with the Lord and us; and we long therefore to see Him.<a name=176:14></a> This characterises the Christian position; the Holy Ghost has come down from heaven, and we know that we are sons; He dwells with us consequent upon accomplished redemption; Christ has thus become precious to us, and the second thing, therefore, that characterises the Christian is, that he is waiting for Christ; I say this advisedly.<a name=176:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Look at the Christian in the Christian place; not merely he has knowledge that characterises him; but he is waiting for Christ to return.<a name=176:16></a> The Thessalonians were converted to serve the living and true God, and to wait for His Son from heaven.<a name=176:17></a> Nothing can be simpler or plainer.<a name=176:18></a> All the various

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first chapter connects His return with conversion;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second, with Paul's ministry;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The third, with holiness which will be manifested at His coming;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The fourth, with the death of the Christian.<a name=177:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord shall come, and the dead shall be raised first, and we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them; and then the apostle adds, "Wherefore comfort one another with these words"; but go and tell that to many a Christian now, and he will think you out of your mind!<a name=177:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I cannot go into all these points; but I just take one, "To wait for his Son from heaven".<a name=177:5></a> Not merely shall I be happy in heaven, but the Lord says, "I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also".<a name=177:6></a> It is striking how it changes a person's feelings, whether it is, as people talk, that I am going to heaven, or that Christ is coming for me.<a name=177:7></a> Going to heaven is never spoken of in Scripture.<a name=177:8></a> The nearest approach to it is in the case of the dying thief: "With me in paradise".<a name=177:9></a> Going to be with Christ is what you do find.<a name=177:10></a> "Absent from the body, .<a name=177:11></a>.<a name=177:12></a>.<a name=177:13></a> present with the Lord" is blessedly true for us; but that is not quite the same thought.<a name=177:14></a> Not that the going to heaven is not true, but where there is only this before the soul, it shuts out the thought of Christ's coming for us.<a name=177:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If I die, I go to be with Him; but if I do not die, then He comes and takes me to be with Him.<a name=177:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And therefore, the calling of the church, the hope, the object, the thing before us -- and this is what a man lives by -- is the Lord's return, for that which characterises a man is what he is going after.<a name=177:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What was the calling of the ten virgins?<a name=177:18></a> To go out and meet the Bridegroom.<a name=177:19></a> But what about the dear good men who died a hundred years ago?<a name=177:20></a> They fell asleep like the virgins.<a name=177:21></a> And what awoke the virgins?<a name=177:22></a> At midnight the cry came, and they all arose and trimmed their lamps; that cry woke them all up.<a name=177:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And herein is the test of everyone's state: Supposing the Lord should come tonight, am I ready to meet Him?<a name=177:24></a> I do not know <i>when</i> He will come; but it says, "in such an hour as ye think not".<a name=177:25></a>

		Are our hearts, our thoughts, and our affections in good order?<a name=178:1></a> Are our lights burning?<a name=178:2></a> Are we confessing Him before men?<a name=178:3></a> Are we like men that wait for their Lord?<a name=178:4></a> For to such He comes and knocks, and opens to them immediately.<a name=178:5></a> That is the character we are to have.<a name=178:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Talking about prophecy is all very easy and interesting in its place, but when a soul has got salvation, then there are two subjects in Scripture; the government of this world, and the sovereignty of grace which takes poor sinners and sets them in Christ.<a name=178:7></a> Prophecy refers to the government of this world, and the Jews are the centre of that; but as for the Christian, I find that he is predestinated to be conformed to the image of Christ, that He might be the firstborn among many brethren.<a name=178:8></a> When will that be?<a name=178:9></a> If I die first, I shall go to be with Christ, and that is blessed; but it is not what Scripture calls conformity to His image.<a name=178:10></a> When will <i>that</i> take place?<a name=178:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"We know" -- a word that Scripture is fond of, for the Holy Ghost is come -- "we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is".<a name=178:12></a> That is when I shall be conformed to His image; and so I am going to be really like Him!<a name=178:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Meanwhile, we are to be like Him in spirit, and in view of that we must realise that "our conversation is in heaven".<a name=178:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have, then, this blessed truth, that Christ is coming again to take us up to be with Himself, that where He is, there we may be also.<a name=178:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, we find that when the Lord was caught up, the disciples were looking up into heaven, and they were told that "this same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven".<a name=178:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Time will not allow me to multiply passages; but I see the calling of the Christian is to be waiting for Christ to come: "Ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord".<a name=178:17></a> And I only ask you, if you were waiting for Christ, would you care to heap up money to meet Christ with?<a name=178:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I add a word or two about the details of it; the Lord here speaks in a double way of His return to shew how fully He would develop it.<a name=178:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Firstly, those are blessed who wait for Christ to come.<a name=178:20></a> We belong already to heaven and to what is eternal, although we do not know when Christ will come and take us there.<a name=178:21></a> Are our hearts taken out of this world, as out of a place from which
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=179>[Page 179]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He has redeemed us, so that we are watching for Him to come?<a name=179:1></a> The word of His patience is so called because He is expecting; and, if He is, of course we are.<a name=179:2></a> The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some men count slackness; though of this, the world is willingly ignorant.<a name=179:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Secondly, those are blessed who are found watching.<a name=179:4></a> What characterises the Blessed One, does also characterise those who are waiting for Him; they are watching to open for Him instantly He returns.<a name=179:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then follows the statement of the blessedness of those who are so watching.<a name=179:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When the Lord cometh, "Verily, I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them".<a name=179:7></a> He spreads the table for them in heaven, and then He sets them down at it.<a name=179:8></a> He spreads it with the best things of heaven; and not only so, but He comes Himself and ministers to them.<a name=179:9></a> But until I do come, He says, you must have your loins girded, and your lights burning; presently I shall have it all My own way, and then I will have you to sit down to meat, and I will serve you Myself!<a name=179:10></a> What a thought that gives us of the love of Christ!<a name=179:11></a> Of course, it is only a figure, to shew us He will never cease to minister the fullest blessedness to His own.<a name=179:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Father has given all things into His hands; and so He takes a towel, girds Himself, and comes, and washes His disciples' feet; just as if He said to them, I want to have you with Me; and while you are down here on the way, you must be clean enough for the place where I am going.<a name=179:13></a> So, again, "If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous".<a name=179:14></a> That is for <i>now</i>.<a name=179:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When their hearts are no longer watching for Christ because they are with Him, He will make them sit down in blessedness, and He Himself will minister to them.<a name=179:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here is, indeed, the reward of labour; and a wonderful place it is that we shall have in the kingdom as the "heirs of God, and the joint-heirs with Christ".<a name=179:17></a> When He takes the power and reigns, we shall reign with Him.<a name=179:18></a> But as to our intrinsic blessedness, the Lord girds Himself and makes us to sit down to meat, and then comes Himself to serve us!<a name=179:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When the Lord is speaking of watching and waiting for Him, He appeals to our affections, to encourage us to wait; and when He comes, He will make us enjoy the blessedness of heaven.<a name=179:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=180>[Page 180]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He is not going to rule alone over the works of His hands; we are joint-heirs with Him.<a name=180:1></a> He is the firstborn among many brethren.<a name=180:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then comes a word of warning upon which I must not enlarge.<a name=180:3></a> "But and if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming", this is pretty much the position of the professing church; not that men say, He will not come, but they do not look for Him as a present thing.<a name=180:4></a> And so they "begin to beat the menservants and maidens, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken"; i.<a name=180:5></a>e.<a name=180:6></a>, they go on ruling and governing the world, and enjoying it, too.<a name=180:7></a> Then "the lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers".<a name=180:8></a> It is one in the place of a servant, who says, "My Lord delayeth", and then his Lord comes when he does not expect Him.<a name=180:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is the judgment of the professing church.<a name=180:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You thus get the broad fact, that where the Lord's coming is deliberately put off in the heart, such an one will have his portion appointed with the unbelievers.<a name=180:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In watching for Christ, the heart's affections are drawn out to Him; that is the great thing; and then, He will set us down, and come forth to serve us.<a name=180:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Meanwhile, there is service for us here; but still His heart's delight is to serve us, and never will Christ be satisfied until He has us in the same glory with Himself.<a name=180:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He is now sitting on His Father's throne, waiting, but soon He will come and receive all true believers unto Himself, that where He is, there they may be also.<a name=180:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		At first, Christians were converted to wait for God's Son from heaven; then they went to sleep and lost the expectation; that which woke them up was the cry of the Bridegroom.<a name=180:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And now comes the question for us: Are <i>we waiting, and are</i> we watching for Christ?<a name=180:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not believe this question has any relation to time.<a name=180:17></a> The government of the world, interesting enough in its place, has nothing to do with it.<a name=180:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is no event between me and heaven.<a name=180:19></a> Plenty of events there are, but they belong to this world, and we do not.<a name=180:20></a> And the practical question for us is as to how far are our hearts up to this?<a name=180:21></a>

		We who are believers, through grace, we do not half believe in the interest Christ personally takes in each one of us.<a name=181:2></a>

		READING ON THE LORD'S SECOND COMING
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The coming of the Lord is connected itself with the whole life and ways of the Christian, and we will now look a little into this.<a name=188:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I turn to it not simply to bring proof of His coming, but to see the way in which it is connected with all the thoughts and with all the feelings of the Christian's life.<a name=188:2></a> Read the close of <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#1">1 Thessalonians  1</a>.<a name=188:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The more we search into the scriptural history of Christianity, the more we shall see it is a totally new thing introduced into the earth.<a name=188:4></a> The coming of the Lord had been prophesied of, as we know, but that is a very different thing.<a name=188:5></a> The Son of God having come, everything is put upon an entirely new footing.<a name=188:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus, God never abode with Adam; He placed man in the garden of Eden, but He did not dwell there.<a name=188:7></a> It was no question of righteousness or of holiness.<a name=188:8></a> Adam was neither righteous nor holy, but he was innocent -- a very different thing He gained the knowledge of good and evil by eating the forbidden fruit.<a name=188:9></a> Then he was turned out of Paradise, and the world continued under probation, during even the time of Christ's life, up to the cross, to see whether the first man could be recovered or not, and only proving that he could not, that no means at God's disposal could recall man back to Him.<a name=188:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the while, when God came and revealed Himself more directly in Israel, and set up something in the world, then there came out these two great facts, viz.<a name=188:11></a>, that God did not come out to man, and man could not go in to God.<a name=188:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The veil was there, and God was behind the veil, and it was death to man to go near Him.<a name=188:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That was a solemn thing.<a name=188:14></a> If man kept God's law, he got a blessing, but still God did not come out to him.<a name=188:15></a> Once a year the high priest went in; the Holy Ghost thus signifying that the way into the holiest was not yet made manifest.<a name=188:16></a> And so we find that God did not come out, but declared Himself in thunderings and lightnings to alarm consciences at Sinai.<a name=188:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He sent the people a law, but He never came out to them Himself, and carefully shewed that man could not go to Him.<a name=188:18></a> Man had got away from God, and could not go in to God.<a name=188:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The very thing we have in Christianity is exactly the opposite.<a name=189:1></a> After it had been proved that man, as man, was irrecoverable, then God did His own work, and the vail of the temple was rent in twain, so that consequently we have now boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus.<a name=189:2></a> God did come out in Christ, and Man, in Christ, has gone into the glory of God.<a name=189:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is a total change in the footing and relationship of man with God.<a name=189:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Of course, when this is all declared, man is doubly guilty if he rejects it.<a name=189:5></a> It is no promise of something that should be, but it is the fact God has come out to man in grace, and Man has gone into the glory of God in righteousness.<a name=189:6></a>

		Until Christ was here, an obedient Man on earth, there had never been a man to whom heaven could be opened; but <i>then</i> it was; and the Holy Ghost as a dove came down, and God the Father owned Christ as Son; and then He stood entirely alone in this world.<a name=189:16></a> It was in grace, but still it was alone, until at the cross redemption was accomplished; and then He could say, "I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God".<a name=189:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The "old man" was rejected; and now, having accomplished His own work by Christ alone, God can have the vail rent, and heaven opened, and the Holy Ghost sent down upon those who believed.<a name=189:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Instead of God not coming out, He <i>has</i> come out; and instead of man not being allowed to go in, he <i>has</i> gone in.<a name=190:7></a> And the Holy Ghost is given to us that we may realise these things.<a name=190:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Redemption is accomplished, and, in spirit, we go in.<a name=190:9></a> We have the certainty that if we die before the Lord comes, we shall go to be with Him; that is all settled; but the purpose of God is that we should be conformed to the image of His Son in glory.<a name=190:10></a> We shall get that when He comes, and never till then.<a name=190:11></a> That is what is always set before us.<a name=190:12></a> Even as to our present walk in holiness, we are identified with Christ, but there is no perfection for the Christian at all but being in the same glory as the Son of God.<a name=190:13></a>

		Our passage through this world is no part of God's purpose; it is part of God's way, but His purpose is simply to put us in Christ, and for us to be perfectly like Christ in the glory which He has as Man.<a name=190:14></a> Of course, He cannot communicate Godhead, though we are made partakers of the divine nature; but we are to be like Him in the glory into which He has entered.<a name=190:15></a>

		READING ON THE FIFTH BOOK OF PSALMS

	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#107">Psalm  107</a>- 150
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is a kind of supplementary book which unfolds to us the ways and dealings of God when Israel is brought back.<a name=200:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It begins by recounting the vicissitudes of their return, and their being sunk down again, after having got into the land; but coupled with this, there is the testimony that God's mercy endureth for ever.<a name=200:2></a> This really began with the ark being brought to Zion by David.<a name=200:3></a> Ichabod had been written on Israel when the ark was taken captive, but when David brought it back, he set the people to sing, "His mercy endureth for ever"; that is to say, God's sovereign grace was above all the failure on man's part.<a name=200:4></a> And this characterises the last book of the Psalms.<a name=200:5></a> "Let the redeemed of the Lord say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy; and gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south".<a name=200:6></a> In the first three verses of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#107">Psalm  107</a>, mercy has risen up over judgment.<a name=200:7></a> And the same ground is taken in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#108">Psalm  108</a>.<a name=200:8></a> After being brought back to the land, they are still in trouble, hungry, etc.<a name=200:9></a>, and, in verse 39, they are again minished and brought low.<a name=200:10></a> We find the same thing in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#18">Isaiah  18</a>; in the midst of judgments Israel is brought back, and then the beasts winter and the fowls summer upon them.<a name=200:11></a> Still, they have got back, and they sing and give thanks.<a name=200:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=200:13></a> Do you mean before antichrist's era?<a name=200:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, yes.<a name=200:15></a> Look at <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#18">Isaiah  18</a>"Woe to the land shadowing with wings", etc.<a name=200:16></a>, which sends ambassadors to bring them back; the inhabitants of the earth are called upon to give attention, and then, in verse 5, "Afore the harvest, when the bud is perfect, and the sour grape is ripening in the flower, he shall both cut off the sprigs with pruning-hooks, and take away and cut down the branches".<a name=200:17></a> There was a sprouting out to fill the land with fruit, but all is cut down.<a name=200:18></a> "In that time shall the present be brought", etc.<a name=200:19></a> (verse 7).<a name=200:20></a> Though they are brought back to the land, their troubles are not finally over.<a name=200:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#109">Psalm  109</a>speaks of Christ, and of Judas also, the son of perdition, with the full power of evil and of the antichristian period; and then, in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#110">Psalm  110</a>, the secret of it all is, that Christ is exalted, for Jehovah has said to Him, "Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool".<a name=201:3></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#108">Psalm  108</a>, God claims the land as His own, saying, "I will divide Shechem and mete out the valley of Succoth".<a name=201:4></a> And <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#111">Psalm  111</a>praises Jehovah for this.<a name=201:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That for which Israel is waiting, is made plain in verse 6 of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#111">Psalm  111</a>"He hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may give them the heritage of the heathen".<a name=201:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Going back to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#108">Psalm  108</a>, we see the state of things in which God is asserting His rights; then, in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#109">Psalm  109</a>, we find the man of perdition, and the moral elements of the last days.<a name=201:8></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#110">Psalm  110</a>, Christ is exalted i.<a name=201:9></a>e.<a name=201:10></a>, prophetically; and in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#111">Psalm  111</a>, we have the works of the LORD.<a name=201:11></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#112">Psalm  112</a>, as already said, it is the character of the man that gets the blessing, and then, in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#113">Psalm  113</a>, Jehovah is to be exalted.<a name=201:12></a> After man has altogether failed, <i>He</i> comes in, in power, and He makes a "barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children".<a name=201:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#116">Psalm  116</a>, he cries, and in the extreme of his distress he is heard, for his affliction has only driven him to Jehovah.<a name=201:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="paragraph">
		No; though He did so.<a name=201:19></a> And now he will come and pay his vows (verse 18).<a name=201:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#117">Psalm  117</a>contains a summons to the nations to come and praise Jehovah; the "truth of the LORD" is seen in His faithfulness to Israel in spite of their failures.<a name=201:21></a> Then, once again, in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#118">Psalm  118</a>, we have, "His mercy endureth for ever".<a name=201:22></a> This is remarkable, for this Psalm celebrates the whole of God's dealings; first, in verses 10 - 12, the power of man is seen as altogether hostile, and that is overcome; then, in verse 13,

		<a name=202>[Page 202]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		there is the adversary, but the LORD helps him, and becomes his salvation.<a name=202:1></a> Verse 18 gives another aspect; it is the chastening of Jehovah, though not as giving him over unto death.<a name=202:2></a> All men are against him; then there is the adversary, and Jehovah chastens him; and next, we have a reference to Christ, "The stone which the builders refused is become the headstone of the corner"; in verse 25, we have what the little children said, "Hosanna", etc.<a name=202:3></a>; and then follows what the Lord quoted when He said that they should not see Him again till they were ready to say, "Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the LORD".<a name=202:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is thus a kind of summary, mercy being the foundation, whilst, if adversaries oppress, the LORD helps.<a name=202:5></a> The adversary may thrust sore at him, but the LORD helps him.<a name=202:6></a> It is, really, the chastening of the LORD.<a name=202:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=202:8></a> What is the day in verse 24?<a name=202:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The millennial day, the true sabbath of Israel, that has come; and so the night is past.<a name=202:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=202:11></a> Does verse 18 refer exclusively to Israel?<a name=202:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It refers to all Israel.<a name=202:13></a> The Lord does not come in here, though He took part in it.<a name=202:14></a> "The stone" is, of course, Christ, but I was referring to the chastening which comes upon Israel.<a name=202:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#119">Psalm  119</a>speaks of the writing of the law on their hearts: "I have gone astray", and so on.<a name=202:16></a> Many words are used, but it is every way the law, and it will be under the new covenant.<a name=202:17></a> In the Hebrew, each verse of each section begins with the letter it is under.<a name=202:18></a> That is the artistic structure of this Psalm.<a name=202:19></a> A portion of the Lamentations of Jeremiah is similarly arranged.<a name=202:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we come to the Songs of Degrees.<a name=202:21></a> They describe the process through which the nation of Israel passes in going back to the land until they reach the full blessing of unity.<a name=202:22></a> They begin thus: "In my distress I cried unto the LORD"; and they end with, "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!<a name=202:23></a>" Having reached this point, then we have, "Ye .<a name=202:24></a>.<a name=202:25></a>.<a name=202:26></a> which by night stand in the house of the LORD".<a name=202:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It may be either a procession toward the temple, or not, but the meaning is clear; beginning with the cry of distress, there is progress leading up to the full blessing of the LORD in His temple.<a name=202:28></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#134">Psalm  134</a>is the last of these Songs of Degrees.<a name=202:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=202:30></a> Why do we get one such as <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#130">Psalm  130</a>?<a name=202:31></a>

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=203>[Page 203]</a>

		Because they have to go through that experience when they are back in the land.<a name=203:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#132">Psalm  132</a>is most striking; it is David and all his afflictions; he makes known his requests, and in each case, the answer surpasses the request.<a name=203:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Arise, O LORD, into thy rest", is answered by, "This is my rest <i>for ever</i>".<a name=203:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness", is answered by, "I will also clothe her priests <i>with salvation</i>".<a name=203:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Let thy saints shout for joy", is answered by, "Her saints shall shout <i>aloud</i> for joy".<a name=203:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Turn not away the face of thine anointed", by, "I will make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed.<a name=203:6></a> His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall his crown flourish".<a name=203:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is also this difference, that whereas, in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#10:35">Numbers  10:35</a>, Moses says, "Rise up, LORD, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate thee, flee before thee", here, it is, "Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou and the ark of thy strength".<a name=203:8></a> And when the ark rested, Moses says, "Return, O LORD, unto the many thousands of Israel"; but here, it is "This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it".<a name=203:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#135">Psalm  135</a>continues with praise to Jehovah and a reference to <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#3">Exodus  3</a>and <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#32">Deuteronomy  32</a>.<a name=203:10></a> In the former passage, it is the Name He takes to stand by Israel for ever, and in the latter, He gives a prophecy shewing that their spot is not the spot of His children (verse 5); and then, after He has traced all their sorrows, He repents Himself for His servants (verse 36).<a name=203:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He rehearses thus their history, and then, in verse 13, we read: "Thy Name, O LORD, endureth for ever; and thy memorial, O LORD, throughout all generations".<a name=203:12></a> So that, in spite of their wickedness, God carries out the original promise in fulfilment of these two passages.<a name=203:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#136">Psalm  136</a>, consequently, takes up every one of these things, adding each time, "His mercy endureth for ever".<a name=203:14></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#137">Psalm  137</a>introduces Babylon, which we have not had at all before this.<a name=203:15></a> The captivity of Babylon lasts on really to the time of the Beast.<a name=203:16></a> The Babylonish captivity in itself was complete, although it lingered on in the three other Beasts.<a name=203:17></a> The return of the Remnant is doubtless a figure of the deliverance of the nation in the last days.<a name=203:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=204:1></a> Why is Edom connected with Babylon?<a name=204:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We learn this from the prophecy of Obadiah, where the character of Edom was one of perpetual hatred and hostility to Israel.<a name=204:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the character of the Roman Beast comes out at the end.<a name=204:4></a> Babylon goes on also to the end.<a name=204:5></a> Here, it is the captivity of Israel when not owned of God.<a name=204:6></a> When they are delivered, Babylon has to be destroyed in another sense, because it is corrupt religionism.<a name=204:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#138">Psalm  138</a>, in spite of this corrupt religion, for he is still taking up Babylon in spirit, he praises Jehovah before the gods.<a name=204:8></a> And notice this, too, that "in the day when I cried thou answeredst me, and strengthenedst me with strength in my soul".<a name=204:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the presence of these false gods, that is, of the power of the devil, we find here two great principles: the word of God, and crying to God.<a name=204:10></a> Just as in Hebrews; it is the word that searches the thoughts and intents of the heart; and then we have the priesthood of Christ.<a name=204:11></a> So, too, in the end of <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10">Luke  10</a>, Mary chooses that good part, and then, in the beginning of chapter 11, we have prayer; these two elements are found there: "sanctified by the word of God and prayer".<a name=204:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#139">Psalm  139</a>, the Spirit of God is going very far for Israel, and it searches out the flesh, too.<a name=204:13></a> Although Israel will be restored in flesh, yet the Spirit of God searches out the flesh, and looks also at creation as God's handiwork.<a name=204:14></a> God searches everything, and with that, the Psalmist owns, "<i>I</i> am fearfully and wonderfully made"; he sees he is God's handiwork, and then he can ask to be searched out.<a name=204:15></a> It is thus a very instructive Psalm for us.<a name=204:16></a> "Whither shall I flee from thy presence?<a name=204:17></a>" etc.<a name=204:18></a> I cannot get out of God's hand, and I cannot stand before His presence; then comes this: "Search me, .<a name=204:19></a>.<a name=204:20></a>.<a name=204:21></a> try me".<a name=204:22></a> It is real grace looking at us.<a name=204:23></a> Of course, it is natural creation that the Psalm is speaking of, because the new creation was not then revealed.<a name=204:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=204:25></a> Is there any direct allusion to the church in verse 16: "Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written", etc.<a name=204:26></a>?<a name=204:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not a <i>direct</i> allusion to it.<a name=204:28></a> He is speaking of creation -- his mother's womb.<a name=204:29></a> It is curious how, in the Old Testament, the earth is dealt with as the mother's womb.<a name=204:30></a> Job does so when he says, "Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and

		There is a special character belonging to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#142">Psalm  142</a>"I cried unto the LORD with my voice".<a name=205:14></a> Not only was his heart groaning, but he expresses himself openly to God.<a name=205:15></a> There is in his supplication a contention with Jehovah, "I cried unto thee, Jehovah; I said, Thou art my refuge, my portion in the land of the living".<a name=205:16></a>

		What is the effect upon us of all the siftings and the sufferings?<a name=231:28></a> Do they make our hearts say, why, we are going to see Christ as He is?<a name=231:29></a> How this brightens our hope, and we call thus glory in tribulation, "knowing that tribulation worketh patience; and patience, experience; and experience, hope: and hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us".<a name=231:30></a> We are going to be with Christ, and to see Christ, and so I can endure all things for the elects' sake, that they may be saved.<a name=231:31></a>

		There is still one thing to which I would refer, and this brings us back to the point where we are found in fact with God: "Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son".<a name=232:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a total taking of us out of the place in which we were.<a name=232:3></a> This involves not merely that we are born again, or the communication of life, or the precious blood of Christ that cleanseth us from all sin (which is the foundation of everything for us all), but that we have a new nature and we are born of God.<a name=232:4></a> There is more here than the blood which has put away our sins; He "hath delivered" us.<a name=232:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus not only are we cleansed, but, where that is true of us, we have been delivered from the whole standing and condition in which we were, and we have been translated into the kingdom of God's dear Son.<a name=232:6></a> This is the only place where it is called the kingdom of His Son, and it is to contrast it with the power of Satan.<a name=232:7></a> This is of great importance for the liberty and joy of our souls.<a name=232:8></a> We were once slaves of Satan, in Egypt, and now we have been taken right out of it.<a name=232:9></a> So, in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>, it is asked, not, who shall cleanse me, but, "who shall deliver me from the body of this death?<a name=232:10></a>" And now it is not merely that the blood is there, and that the judge cannot touch us, but it is an <i>entire</i> deliverance.<a name=232:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		No doubt the <i>full</i> effect of the blood is to take us out of the place we were in, and to set us in another.<a name=232:12></a> The One who has shed His blood, has there wrought that which effects another thing, viz.<a name=232:13></a>, the complete deliverance from the power of darkness, and the translation into the kingdom of God's dear Son.<a name=232:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another element in this, which helps us to understand what I have been saying as to trial, and as to the complete joyfulness which we have in Christ at the same time.<a name=232:15></a> The apostle proceeds to show that Christ, having created everything, is to have everything.<a name=232:16></a> All things were created by Him, and for Him; and He is before all things, and by Him all things consist.<a name=232:17></a> The One who is divine is the One who upholds everything.<a name=232:18></a>

		Then, again, "He is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead".<a name=232:19></a> Death is below, down below the lowest creation, and Christ went down below it all.<a name=232:20></a> The One who has died has gone down to where

		I add one more word: "If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard".<a name=233:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here we have just what we always do find in Scripture; when the saints are looked at as in Christ, all is a settled thing for them; but when, as here in Colossians, the saints are looked at as passing through this world, we find the "ifs" and the exhortations (and God forbid that we should weaken one word of Scripture) addressed uniformly to them, saying: "Well now, you must <i>get</i> to heaven", and, "you have to judge things", and the like.<a name=233:21></a> But if we are looked at in heaven, we are "complete in him".<a name=233:22></a> Nor is there any question about His faithfulness in helping us through the journey.<a name=233:23></a>

		the very nap of their coats, and the manna never did fail.<a name=234:1></a> God must sift and exercise us, and pull us to pieces here, but we have the promise, "I give unto them eternal life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand".<a name=234:2></a> What is the good of telling us that, if there is no danger of our being plucked out?<a name=234:3></a> We learn therefore the patient faithfulness of God in every place.<a name=234:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would not weaken these words one bit.<a name=234:5></a> Why, Christ ever lives to make intercession for us!<a name=234:6></a> We are getting grace from Him every moment; but this is not a question of our being made meet at all.<a name=234:7></a> "If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous"; when we fail, the foundation is not touched, but we need to be restored, so that we are kept, where we ought to be, in dependence upon God.<a name=234:8></a> We want to be settled as to our place in Christ, so that our hearts may be happy and joyful; and we want to be dependent, too; and as we go through the wilderness, we learn that if He were to leave us one single minute -- but He will not do that -- we have no resources of our own at all.<a name=234:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, these things are put together for us in this epistle.<a name=234:10></a> The saints are reconciled to God, but they are still journeying down here, with the hope of the glory before them, knowing that they are made meet for it; and now they have to walk worthy of the Lord, and to trust the blessed, gracious, faithfulness of him who "shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ".<a name=234:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Look at how two things are put together: "to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight", and, "if ye continue in the faith grounded and settled".<a name=234:12></a> In the Corinthians, where they were going on badly, Paul writes, "God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord".<a name=234:13></a>

		LECTURE ON @HEBREWS 2
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A wonderful inquiry is this which is quoted from <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8">Psalm  8</a>, "What is man, that thou art mindful of him?<a name=235:1></a>" -- an inquiry founded on the nothingness of man in himself, but bringing out, as God's answer to it, all His counsels in Christ.<a name=235:2></a> "What is man, that thou art mindful of him?<a name=235:3></a>" Such is his littleness.<a name=235:4></a> And then the answer comes, not according to what man is, but according to the counsels of God, in which we find Christ is the Man in whom the wisdom of God is to be displayed.<a name=235:5></a> I speak not merely of the display of power -- creation shews us that -- but also of the display of all those qualities in God in which His nature comes out; and these are more than His attributes.<a name=235:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Divine power can assert itself, and the thing is done; very wonderful it is, of course; but we find here a great deal more than that.<a name=235:7></a> Christ is the One in whom angels have to learn what God is, His ways and in His counsels, for the simple reason that He who is the Word of God has become a Man, in keeping with those counsels, so that He who created angels has taken up the cause, not of angels, but of man.<a name=235:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Necessarily, then, all the ways and all the qualities of God (I use this word to distinguish from mere attributes, such as power and the like), His holiness, His love, His righteousness, all these things have come out in man, because they are associated with the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=235:9></a> It is this that gives man such a wonderful position, quite unlike that of angels.<a name=235:10></a> Glorious creatures they are, preserved unfallen by the power of God, and which shews His ways, in that respect, His power to do so, and the like; but men have been taken up, when sinners, in order to display the glory of God in them, and that is another thing altogether.<a name=235:11></a> The things that are in the highest degree a revelation of the character of God do not come out in connection with angels; no doubt angels in a certain sense need mercy, for no creature can stand by itself without being sustained by the Creator; that is quite true, and I am sure we all know this.<a name=235:12></a> But angels do not need redemption.<a name=235:13></a> So that as regards grace, mercy, love, redemption, and the unfolding of righteousness; where it is called in question, all that comes out in man,

		as Paul says, in carrying this out, "We are made a spectacle unto the world and to angels and to men".<a name=236:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Man was made in the image of God.<a name=236:2></a> This is never said of angels.<a name=236:3></a> But we get special testimony as regards the responsibility of man as a fallen creature; and then, after he had fallen, we find grace and power coming in and connecting him with the Creator Himself, so that He is not ashamed to call them brethren.<a name=236:4></a> That is brought out so wonderfully by this question, "What is man?<a name=236:5></a>" It is a testimony to man's lowliness, looking at man as he is in himself, "crushed", as Job says, "before the moth"; but the moment I reach the thoughts of God as to man, I see God setting him over the works of His hand, and crowning him with glory and honour.<a name=236:6></a> That has put man into a wonderful place.<a name=236:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Angels excel men in glory, and strength, and so on, but they are not said to be made in the image of God, and there never was, till Adam, a being set up to be the centre of an immense system that was to turn around himself; but that system is now a fallen one, and everyone is seeking to be a centre for himself.<a name=236:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The whole system is, therefore, fallen under the bondage of corruption; but man, in the Person of the Lord Jesus Christ, will yet be the centre of everything that God has created.<a name=236:9></a> He has put under Him all the works of His hands.<a name=236:10></a> Yet, when He said, "all things", it is manifest that He is excepted which did put all things under Him.<a name=236:11></a> God alone is the one exception to this statement, which exception proves that all else is put under Him.<a name=236:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the Person of Christ, Man is Lord of all.<a name=236:13></a> There we see the Lordship of Christ is over everything; it is not only dominion, but it is dominion in a Redeemer, i.<a name=236:14></a>e.<a name=236:15></a>, in the One who keeps it safe, the One who descended first into the lower parts of the earth, to death and the grave, but who descended that He might ascend up far above all heavens, so that He might fill all things.<a name=236:16></a> He will fill all things in the power of the redemption He has wrought.<a name=236:17></a> He gathers together in One, i.<a name=236:18></a>e.<a name=236:19></a>, in Himself, all things which are in heaven, and which are on earth.<a name=236:20></a> All things were created by Him, and for Him, but while He is actually Head, He will not take them until He takes them as Man; and then, what is further revealed is, that we are heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Jesus Christ, just as He says in <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>, "The glory which thou gavest me I have

		given them; that they may be one, even as we are one".<a name=237:1></a> There we come in, though, of course, he is the Firstborn amongst the many brethren.<a name=237:2></a> He brings us in every respect into the relationship in which He stands Himself as Man.<a name=237:3></a> Being Son Himself, He makes us sons; and this place He has taken that it might be made ours.<a name=237:4></a> So He tells us, "I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God and your God".<a name=237:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then let us remember another thing which is so wonderful, viz.<a name=237:6></a>, it is by redemption.<a name=237:7></a> How could He take sinners, and put them in such a place with Himself?<a name=237:8></a> He could not do this to sinners, as such; so He came down to where the sinners were, and He put Himself -- sinless, of course -- into their place.<a name=237:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Therein I learn where I was: "If one died for all, then were all dead".<a name=237:10></a> God "hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin .<a name=237:11></a>.<a name=237:12></a>.<a name=237:13></a>".<a name=237:14></a> He came down to the place of death and judgment, passing through all the toil and difficulty of this world, as we do, but perfect in it all, that He might take our hearts up to where He is, giving us a title by redemption, and a condition by grace, in which we can be associated with Him as the Firstborn among many brethren.<a name=237:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not merely the fact that we are saved -- that is true -- but He has associated Himself with us down here, in order that, by the love that He has brought into our hearts, He might lead us into the very place where He has gone, making the Father's love known to us, for "Thou .<a name=237:16></a>.<a name=237:17></a>.<a name=237:18></a> hast loved them, as thou hast loved me".<a name=237:19></a> Not only have we a place in glory, in consequence, but Christ has come for the very purpose of associating us with Himself, in heart, in spirit, in love, and in mind, so that He should not be <i>ashamed</i> to call us brethren.<a name=237:20></a> But He might well have been ashamed, if He had taken us as we were.<a name=237:21></a> We see thus the various characters of the way through which God has brought Him.<a name=237:22></a> He Himself could say, "Now is the Son of man glorified, and God <i>is</i> glorified in him".<a name=237:23></a> Besides the putting away of our sins, He was in Himself a sweet savour to God.<a name=237:24></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In this chapter, God gives us the reasons for which Christ had to pass through this place of sorrow, so that we might have this blessing with Him.<a name=237:25></a> It became God, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the Captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.<a name=237:26></a> All is founded upon this great, original truth, that Christ Himself, i.<a name=237:27></a>e.<a name=237:28></a>, the Wisdom of <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#8">Proverbs  8</a>, was rejoicing in the habitable parts of God's earth, and His

	<div class="paragraph">
		Where did His delight go out?<a name=238:6></a> To the habitable parts of His earth before ever they were made.<a name=238:7></a> "I was by him, as one brought up with him"; and there His heart went out to the sons of men.<a name=238:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then Christ became a man; and that is the source and foundation of everything to us.<a name=238:9></a> He took up the seed of Abraham, i.<a name=238:10></a>e.<a name=238:11></a>, those who are the heirs of faith.<a name=238:12></a> And then we find that the divine purpose and plan is to gather together in One the things which are in heaven and on earth, and to put them under the hand of Christ as Man.<a name=238:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the previous chapter, the ground given for this is, that He is Son; in <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1">Colossians  1</a>it is, that He created them; and in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8">Psalm  8</a>, and in Ephesians and 1 Corinthians, it is, that all things are put under Him, according to God's counsels and plan; that is to say, as Son; as Creator; and according to God's counsels.<a name=238:14></a> "Unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak", but "Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet".<a name=238:15></a> That is the purpose and intention of God.<a name=238:16></a> But then there comes in another thing, "We see not yet all things put under him".<a name=238:17></a> One half of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8">Psalm  8</a>is already fulfilled, for He is crowned with glory and honour.<a name=238:18></a> But the "all things" are not yet put under His feet; He is still waiting for His joint-heirs.<a name=238:19></a> Now is the time of the gathering, by the gospel, the joint-heirs, ere He takes His power, and reigns.<a name=238:20></a> As Paul says, "I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you".<a name=238:21></a> There was a distinct set of promises belonging to this earth, and you get that in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>, where God sets His King in Zion, and says, "Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession".<a name=238:22></a> That is the "world to come", but it is not the <i>higher</i> position of Him who is to have the "world to come".<a name=238:23></a> And therefore in that connection we read of Christ's rejection, "Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?<a name=238:24></a> The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed".<a name=238:25></a> This is the very passage Peter quotes in Acts.<a name=238:26></a> But, being rejected, Christ takes another

		Rejected as the King of Zion, He was cast out by the world in order that God's righteousness might be accomplished; He was then answered, according to the virtue and value of what He had done, by God's setting Him at His own right hand; and so He says, "Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool".<a name=239:12></a> That time has not come yet, and therefore we must suffer with Him, because His enemies are not made His footstool.<a name=239:13></a> The world is all around us, and Satan is not yet bound; everything that God set up as good has been spoiled; and so it will be until Satan is bound.<a name=239:14></a> So that you see, Christ is sitting at the right hand of God, not having taken His own throne, but yet with tide over everything, both as Creator and also in redemption, having first of all descended into the lower parts of the earth.<a name=239:15></a> I repeat, He has title over all things, but, with His enemies still in power, He has not yet taken possession of them; but He Himself will rise up, more dreadful than ever, and all then will be put down.<a name=239:16></a>

		The glory is all His, but He does not take His place at the right hand of God, as Man, until He had accomplished redemption, tasted death, and gone down to the lowest place and condition to which man can descend; I speak now of sufferings, rather than atonement, though that also is in this chapter.<a name=240:6></a> He tastes death, and goes down to that in which the curse was expressed upon the first man, and a great deal more besides.<a name=240:7></a> But here it is the great and blessed testimony to the way in which He has taken man in His own Person up into glory He came into the world, and left it to go to the Father, not, however, by the aid of twelve legions of angels; but by going through as Man where we were, on His way as Man to glory I speak of the road He took.<a name=240:8></a> He tasted death.<a name=240:9></a> I find the great general fact, that He who created everything, and who is now sitting at the right hand of God, did not take such a place, until He had gone down to the lowest place -- down to death -- and I am not now speaking of atonement.<a name=240:10></a>

		This may be seen in three ways.<a name=243:9></a> If we take John, Christ is in us, and we in Him; chapter 17.<a name=243:10></a> If we take Paul, we are members of Christ's body; but if we take the question of our coming to God, which Hebrews treats of, then we can go into the holiest.<a name=243:11></a> I do not call that priesthood, but it is the place where we go through redemption.<a name=243:12></a> And it is important to understand that, because it is often used as if priesthood was to bring us there, and therefore persons go to the priest.<a name=243:13></a> Surely He will hear them in His mercy, though they go wrongly.<a name=243:14></a> But it is not right; we are there already, accepted in the Beloved.<a name=243:15></a> "By one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified".<a name=243:16></a> But is that all?<a name=243:17></a> It is not all the truth.<a name=243:18></a> Did not Christ live upon earth?<a name=243:19></a> Was He not perfect upon earth?<a name=243:20></a> Are you not living upon earth?<a name=243:21></a> Are you perfect upon earth?<a name=243:22></a> That is another story.<a name=243:23></a> It is not all the truth to say, I am in Christ before God; it is the foundation of all, but it is not all the truth as to what is passing in our hearts.<a name=243:24></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Sure, if there was not perfection in Christ for us, and for our own, we could not go on.<a name=244:6></a> But mark what chapter 4 unfolds to us in verses 14 - 16: "Seeing then that we have a great high priest .<a name=244:7></a>.<a name=244:8></a>.<a name=244:9></a> let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace .<a name=244:10></a>.<a name=244:11></a>.<a name=244:12></a> and find grace", etc.<a name=244:13></a>, etc.<a name=244:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We have, there, a standing witness of righteousness and of propitiation.<a name=244:15></a> This is because Christ is there, and He is both.<a name=244:16></a> Then, in <a href="../bible/1John.htm#2">1 John  2</a>, "If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father", etc.<a name=244:17></a> Christ is our righteousness, and so all is settled; if it were not, we should have sins imputed to us, but we stand in Him as our righteousness before God, and He is there according to the value of His propitiation; then, if we fail, He takes up our cause there, and grace comes to deal with our hearts and spirits, to restore us, without our righteousness ever being touched.<a name=244:18></a> It is because our righteousness never can be touched that we can go on.<a name=244:19></a> This is not our highest place, which we have as members of His body, of His flesh and of His bones; in one word, as being "in Christ"; but it is the highest character of His grace now to help us when we are in weakness, and in infirmity.<a name=244:20></a> If God commended His love towards us, it is when we were sinners, and as we learn this, we joy in God; He loved us when there was nothing in us to love.<a name=244:21></a> The grand testimony to absolute divine love is that God loved sinners.<a name=244:22></a> Well, it is the same way as to the graciousness of God.<a name=244:23></a> The grace of Christ is not, after all, our highest place; but it is the highest place of Christ.<a name=244:24></a> It makes us little and Christ great.<a name=244:25></a> To be put into Christ makes us great.<a name=244:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To find Christ going the same path as myself, so that He may understand every feeling I have, makes His grace great; and that is so precious.<a name=244:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This brings us to the next point; and that is, Christ suffered that He might sympathise.<a name=244:28></a> It was part of His perfection that
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=245>[Page 245]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He was ever dependent upon His Father, "I will put my trust in him".<a name=245:1></a> In this way it was that He went through the whole scene.<a name=245:2></a> Before going to appoint the twelve disciples, He prayed all night, and so He acted all along the path of opposition and insult that He trod.<a name=245:3></a> I know therefore that I have not One who cannot be touched with the feeling of my infirmities, so that in the midst of my infirmities, as Paul says, I can glory that Christ's power may rest on me.<a name=245:4></a> You remember what Christ says to him there; He had sent Paul a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet him, but now He says, "My grace is sufficient for thee".<a name=245:5></a> He answers him, deals with him, understands him, and that is all he wanted.<a name=245:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With Paul, it was thus the humble weak place of the believer; but there was the constant and touching exercise of Christ's grace towards him.<a name=245:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A third reason why He took this place of humiliation and suffering (not exactly a part of His priesthood, though the priest took it), was, that through death He might annul the power of Satan.<a name=245:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First.<a name=245:9></a> It "became" God to lead Christ through this pathway of suffering with regard to God's own glory.<a name=245:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Second.<a name=245:11></a> Christ was there putting his trust in God, while going through it, and so is now able to sympathise.<a name=245:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Third.<a name=245:13></a> He destroys Satan's power.<a name=245:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, in verses 16, 17, 18 of chapter 2, we come to the more proper and immediate exercise of priesthood.<a name=245:15></a> "For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham", etc.<a name=245:16></a> The children were first partakers of flesh and blood, and were in trial and difficulty (it does not say <i>sin</i>, though they might sin).<a name=245:17></a> Then He calls them His brethren, and He sings in the midst of the church.<a name=245:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Think what that is!<a name=245:19></a> Not, <i>you</i> may sing now that I have accomplished redemption, true though that is, but, <i>I</i> will sing.<a name=245:20></a> Christ leads our praises.<a name=245:21></a> He has so associated us with Himself now, that He takes up all our thoughts and feelings.<a name=245:22></a> Praise for redemption it is, and also every thought and feeling which I can express to God.<a name=245:23></a> For Christ is a man.<a name=245:24></a> He knows what it is to bear God's wrath, as none of us will ever know.<a name=245:25></a> That is over; it is gone for Him on the cross, and it is gone for us by reason of His having borne it.<a name=245:26></a> And then He declares the Father's name to His brethren, and leads their praises.<a name=245:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

		and atonement, go up to God; but the expression of every thought and feeling that can be in our hearts, as exercised down here, goes up likewise in praise.<a name=246:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All that which enters into this, Christ has gone through; and now He sings in the midst of the church; this is a figurative expression, but it is true that He is the Person who leads every feeling and thought of exercised persons, because He has gone through it all Himself, and He leads the praises up to God.<a name=246:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When it comes to the accomplishment of the way, it is the same thing: "In that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted".<a name=246:3></a> It is not here a question of our perfectness or of our acceptance before God, but that the heart of the Lord understands and enters into every trial and difficulty we have.<a name=246:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Just as if He might ask us, "Do you think I have not been tempted, and that I have not gone through sorrow?<a name=246:5></a>" He could say, "Now is my soul troubled and what shall I say?<a name=246:6></a>" there was with Him the constant passing through this world with all that is in it.<a name=246:7></a> And there He is on high, but understanding every one of the exercises through which we pass as belonging to God.<a name=246:8></a> He belonged to God, and as such was made perfect through sufferings; and if we belong to God according to His acceptance, we must pass through sufferings.<a name=246:9></a> It is in that respect that He helps and succours them that are tempted.<a name=246:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Our weakness and our dependence, and the trials and exercises which we go through here, find an echo in Christ's heart, and they become thus a link between our hearts and His.<a name=246:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not a question of righteousness, but of what belongs to the righteous, that is the difference; nor is it a question of sin, but of having our whole hearts down here brought into the tune and tone of Christ's feelings, the One who went through it here, that He might lead our hearts into the channel of His own heart.<a name=246:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Fourth.<a name=246:13></a> He is a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to <i>make reconciliation</i> for the sins of the people.<a name=246:14></a> To make reconciliation.<a name=246:15></a> This was not strictly a priestly act; it was not going between God and the people at all; it was the high priest who did it on the day of atonement, but it was for himself as well as for the people.<a name=246:16></a> In different ways Christ fulfils all the shadows.<a name=246:17></a> He was Victim as well as high priest.<a name=246:18></a> But Christ could not take up on earth the ordinary

	<div class="paragraph">
		exercises of His priesthood, for if He were on earth, He should not be a priest; but the people must have a ground on which they could stand in such a place.<a name=247:1></a> Before beginning His ordinary exercises as high priest, Christ made propitiation, and there He stood as representative of the people.<a name=247:2></a> He was both Victim and also the priest who confessed the sins.<a name=247:3></a> We find in this the blessed truth of the perfectness of the work of atonement, and of the full confession of the sin.<a name=247:4></a> We get Christ owning all our sins upon the cross.<a name=247:5></a> He was the Victim and the Scapegoat who carried them all away, and the high priest who confessed them.<a name=247:6></a> He charges Himself with them all, and then deals with them in atonement; that act is the basis of all the rest, and now He is able to save to the uttermost them that come unto God by Him.<a name=247:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then we see that He suffered being tempted; that is not atonement.<a name=247:8></a> It was part of His trial, and it enables Him to succour them that are tempted.<a name=247:9></a> And, I repeat, it is not that we go to Christ as priest; God does not, of course, make anyone an offender for a word if the heart is right; but Christ goes to God for us, and we go to God by Him.<a name=247:10></a>

		The Spirit of God groans in us.<a name=247:11></a> We have an Advocate, which is the same word as Comforter.<a name=247:12></a> The Holy Ghost, as dwelling in us, occupies Himself in divine sympathies, with all our sorrows, whilst Christ takes them up for us in the presence of God; and the effect is that blessing comes down to our souls by the Holy Ghost.<a name=247:13></a> In this connection, it says, He is able to save to the uttermost, i.<a name=247:14></a>e.<a name=247:15></a>, unto the end.<a name=247:16></a> He is talking, in all this, about our going through the wilderness.<a name=247:17></a> You do not find union spoken of here in the wilderness, but exercises and trials.<a name=247:18></a> Christ enters into all this, and we get grace to help in time of need.<a name=247:19></a> His death has perfected us for God; His life carries us on with God until we reach Him.<a name=247:20></a> Christ ever lives for that.<a name=247:21></a> We have the blessed consciousness of our weakness, and quite right, too; but with the weakness, we learn to look to One, and to lean on One who can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities.<a name=247:22></a> Do you believe that this is Christ's heart now?<a name=247:23></a> I do not believe that this has its proper place with us until we have righteousness; and it is a mistake to suppose that we get righteousness by the priest.<a name=247:24></a> Christ is there; and believing in Him, we are made the righteousness of God in Him.<a name=247:25></a>

		LECTURE ON @HEBREWS 8

	<div class="paragraph">
		This verses are just a summary of what has gone before.<a name=249:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is remarkable how much we may be found amongst the circumstances in which we are placed -- having God in them, but still amongst them -- or how much we may get out of them all, in spirit, into that to which we are called by grace.<a name=249:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The very hymn we have been singing ("Lord Jesus!<a name=249:3></a> when I think of Thee" <a href=".<a name=249:4></a>.<a name=249:5></a>\hymns\hymns1972.<a name=249:6></a>htm#151:1">Hymn 151</a>), you will find to be a different thing, with a totally different state of feeling, and not wrong, either, while singing it, according as you may be thinking of the wondrous blessedness there is in the place you are in, or as you look at it as a rest out of that place.<a name=249:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Scripture is so.<a name=249:8></a> Both are true.<a name=249:9></a> In one verse of the hymn, you may pray to be kept stayed on Him "till", or you may rise up to the blessing, by merely thinking of that.<a name=249:10></a> They are two different states of soul and feeling.<a name=249:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this is what the word of God does.<a name=249:12></a> It may bring light or testimony to us down here, or it may take us up there, in spirit I mean, just as a passage upon which I was meditating Elsewhere forms a link between the two.<a name=249:13></a> Christ says, "Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth".<a name=249:14></a> The Word has come down here, and deals with our souls as down here; but He adds, "For their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth", that is, He takes us up there; as He has gone away, a man apart from the rest of men, so would He have it for us, forming our hearts into the same.<a name=249:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Word of God has come down here, and brings divine truth into the scene where we are -- love with it, too, and also holiness and grace -- but Jesus did not leave us here, for He has gone back, and He associates us with Himself where He now is.<a name=249:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Our thoughts take up thus a double character.<a name=249:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Perfect grace has brought Him down to the sinner; at the same time, having secured the accomplishment of redemption, it carries us into the place where He is.<a name=249:18></a> And the heart is touched by this; and so it goes through a process of feeling of this double character.<a name=249:19></a> I ought never to be weary in well-doing down here, and yet rest is spoken of.<a name=249:20></a> It is conflict

		still.<a name=250:1></a> The Lord Jesus could say, "If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said I go unto the Father".<a name=250:2></a> He came down here bringing grace and truth to us; but nothing would have been done if, besides this, He had not gone away and linked us up there.<a name=250:3></a> We experience therefore mixed feelings and thoughts, through the bringing of divine light and love into the scene where we are, and then through the taking of our hearts out of it.<a name=250:4></a> In one sense, of course, it would not be true that our hearts are out of it; and therefore we have a further truth, and that is, that wherever we reach the other world, in spirit, we must get the cross.<a name=250:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is true, not only as to redemption itself, but as to every step and detail, for the natural heart and flesh have no taste for heaven, no affections for heaven, nothing that corresponds with heaven; and therefore it is that I can say: "I ought to be all heavenly, but there is still a great deal in me that practically cannot conform itself with heaven".<a name=250:6></a> <i>There</i>, all is love; lusts have no place in heaven, and worldliness can never enter there with me; and therefore it is, as the Lord insists, "I will raise him up at the last day".<a name=250:7></a> You cannot know the bread come down from heaven, unless you know the dying Saviour who has gone up out of the world.<a name=250:8></a> He asked, "Wherefore, when I came, was there no man?<a name=250:9></a>" but He found nothing that answered, and there is still a great deal that does not answer.<a name=250:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Practical sanctification of the heart, whilst it judges that which is in us, takes us up into the other world.<a name=250:11></a> You will find from Scripture that a person may have a very blessed, God-given, apprehension of Christ, and of His Person, and yet not have the flesh subdued in him in the measure that will enable him to enjoy this thoroughly, or to take up the position and consequences down here that follow from it.<a name=250:12></a> We talk very truly of the church's place being in heaven, but we find a great many things in our hearts that have not the smallest place in heaven; and I do not now speak of insincerity.<a name=250:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I have in my mind is, Peter first of all confessing, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God"; the next thing we find is, that Christ was to be delivered into the hands of the Gentiles, etc.<a name=250:14></a>, etc.<a name=250:15></a>; and then Peter says, Have mercy upon yourself, Lord, such a thing must not happen to you!<a name=250:16></a> But if Christ is to build the Church, this must take place.<a name=250:17></a> The Father had revealed to Peter the Person of Christ, Son of the living God; but the instant that his confession brought

		in the truth of the cross, Peter's mind was not prepared for it; and yet the cross was the necessary consequence of it.<a name=251:1></a> So that it is no question of sincerity.<a name=251:2></a> We may be truly taught of God, and yet we may find that when we come to our walk down here, we have not realised the practical effect of the cross.<a name=251:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Grace and truth have come by Jesus Christ.<a name=251:4></a> This is not merely to take our minds up to the heavenly, but also to bring the heavenly down to us, to enable us to judge the practical condition of our souls.<a name=251:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Both these things are seen in Christ, and His present position is just the link between them.<a name=251:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On a former occasion, we were seeing the way in which He enters into our sorrows (without sin, of course), and yet, if He were not up there, He could not be a priest, because the object of His Priesthood is to take our hearts up there.<a name=251:7></a> He entered into our sorrows and circumstances, in order that now He might sustain our hearts in them, so that we might be free to be occupied with the things above.<a name=251:8></a> In heaven, we shall not want trial, or instruction, or chastening, or discipline, or anything of the kind.<a name=251:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In what I have been saying, it is a question of the soul being with God (not of a child with a Father), and of its competency to enter into the holiest.<a name=251:10></a> If I have been naughty, I can go and tell my Father, but when we speak of going to God, it must be with fitness.<a name=251:11></a> God's majesty, His unchangeable holiness, and His glory are then in question.<a name=251:12></a> It is not merely a question of righteousness, but of all that belongs to the holiest.<a name=251:13></a> We have a perfect tide to be there, but we want two things; we need sustaining grace down here, and at the same time, as a present thing, we need the capacity to be close to the throne of God where there is no evil.<a name=251:14></a> I do not say "title", merely, for <i>that</i> question is all settled.<a name=251:15></a> The vail <i>is</i> rent, and Christ is in God's presence for us.<a name=251:16></a> He <i>is</i> our righteousness, and even though we may never understand our absolute acceptance, yet everything is founded upon it.<a name=251:17></a> I have, by faith, to reckon fully and distinctly upon this, that I have a perfect title to go into the holiest; but that will bring down the judgment of the holiest upon all that I am in fact.<a name=251:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We were seeing before, in chapter 2, that there are four grounds for the death of Christ.<a name=251:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, the majesty of God: "It became him .<a name=251:20></a>.<a name=251:21></a>.<a name=251:22></a> in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation

		perfect through suffering", that is, perfected in the glory, which is what is meant all through here by "perfect".<a name=252:1></a> If He took up our cause, He must go through what was needed for us.<a name=252:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Second, what is mentioned last, but what is foundation truth, "To make reconciliation", or propitiation, "for the sins of the people".<a name=252:3></a> Sacrifice there must be, and He was that Himself.<a name=252:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Third.<a name=252:5></a> He suffers, for He must sympathise with us down here.<a name=252:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Fourth.<a name=252:7></a> To destroy the power of Satan.<a name=252:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		For all this it was that He was made a little lower than the angels.<a name=252:9></a> Christ has gone through all that was needed to bring us to God.<a name=252:10></a> And thus He is available for all, for everything in fact.<a name=252:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then follows the consideration of the shadow (not the very image) of good things to come; under the law, the priests stood in contrast with Christ, specially in respect of their own infirmity, and so of their competency to sympathise; they were in the same things at the same time, and they could have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that were out of the way, for that they also were compassed with infirmity.<a name=252:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But that would not do for us; and still less so, because if they themselves were in the infirmity when they had the sympathy, they must always stay down here on earth, and thus, through them, the people could go no further than earth; if, therefore, that had been so with the priesthood of Christ, it would have ended where it was exercised; indeed it does so now, for it is in heaven, and cannot, of course, go further.<a name=252:13></a> The vail indicated that if the high priest only went in once a year, other priests could not go in at all.<a name=252:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But now that redemption is accomplished, the vail is rent; the holiest and the holy are both one; and we are made nigh to God Himself.<a name=252:15></a> And so, all through this epistle, you will find contrast.<a name=252:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus, it is not now priests dying one after another, but the power of an endless life.<a name=252:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, sacrifices were repeated; now, in Christianity, we have one sacrifice once for all, never to be repeated.<a name=252:18></a> It is the groundwork on which priesthood is to be exercised for ever, and it goes on until there is no more need of it.<a name=252:19></a> In the glory we shall not want it.<a name=252:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is also this complete difference, viz.<a name=252:21></a>, we go into the

	<div class="paragraph">
		holiest itself, and our High Priest is not compassed with infirmity (for even in the sense in which He was so on-earth, all that is over); and therein we find that of which I was speaking at first, the connection between the trials and sorrows here, and the place into which we are taken where Christ has gone.<a name=253:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before going up on high, our High Priest went through everything that was needed in order that He might sympathise with us, and help us, and lead us on.<a name=253:2></a> But now that He is exercising priesthood, all that is over.<a name=253:3></a> And we have perfect boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood, so much so, that I want my heart to be in the place where everything is settled.<a name=253:4></a> I want to have done with the things that hinder my heart from being there (and there are plenty of them), dimming the perception of these heavenly things.<a name=253:5></a> The Lord, therefore, puts us through various temptations of heart and spirit, that we may really know ourselves; and we need, not simply the fact of being kept safe (though that is true) all along the way, but also the sense we are being kept by the power of God, <i>through faith</i>.<a name=253:6></a> That is the way we are kept.<a name=253:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Is your faith ever dim or feeble?<a name=253:8></a> I mean, as to your walk; not, of course, as to your salvation.<a name=253:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11">Hebrews  11</a>it is all through the path of faith, save in the case of Abel, which gives us the introduction to it.<a name=253:10></a> He takes up, first, creation, then redemption, and then the rest is just a question of the pathway, of that which exercises the faith we have in walking onwards, and which needs to be sustained.<a name=253:11></a> All things down here, agreeable or painful, tend to hinder our going on.<a name=253:12></a> "Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee"; they do not always do so; sometimes they look askance.<a name=253:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, the devil tempted Christ; and have not your hearts seen a little of that?<a name=253:14></a> Is there not a little bit in you that is not so dead but what your own heart knows it?<a name=253:15></a> Christ rejected it all, of course.<a name=253:16></a> And so, again, towards the end of His ministry; then, it was-by testing His obedience, which though perfect, was tested; it was tested at the first by the attraction of everything that Satan could offer to Him as a man, and then, at the last, by every terror that Satan could press upon Him as a man.<a name=253:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, we have to walk the path of faith; and therefore, Christ is spoken of as the Author and Finisher of faith.<a name=253:18></a> He was tested in every possible way in which He could be tested,

		and it just proved His perfectness.<a name=254:1></a> In the garden, His disciples went to sleep for sorrow, when they should have been watching with Him, only showing what poor human beings we are.<a name=254:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so, too, at the Transfiguration, when He was in the glory, they were fast asleep, and only just woke up in time to see it.<a name=254:3></a> The flesh was weak, but the spirit willing.<a name=254:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Gethsemane, they were asleep again; they could not stand the cup they saw coming upon them, and they would get rid of it by going to sleep; poor work, indeed, but it is what we find in weak human nature.<a name=254:5></a> With the blessed Lord, it was either communion with Moses and Elias about His decease, or that, being in an agony, He prayed the more earnestly.<a name=254:6></a> Poor human nature quailed, but in Him it produced more energetic supplication to God, in respect of that which was before Him.<a name=254:7></a> This is what we see in the perfect Man, and this is what we have to learn.<a name=254:8></a> I do not say that there is any sin in weakness, though it may run into it; but when a person is going through the path of faith with everything against him, this becomes either the occasion of obedience, or the means of temptation.<a name=254:9></a> There is not a thing we meet with but what proves to be so; take even the question of sleep, well, we may be lazy in that.<a name=254:10></a> If in what comes to me, I am without Christ, it will keep my heart from Christ; but if I am with Christ in it, it may be a blessed opportunity for me to learn His grace in it.<a name=254:11></a> There is not a thing we meet with, from morning to night (apart from the question of sins), but it becomes a question of our eyes looking straight forward, with Christ all in all, i.<a name=254:12></a>e.<a name=254:13></a>, all <i>to</i> us as Object, and <i>in</i> us as Life.<a name=254:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And there is another thing: "I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh" and here I come to practice -- "I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me".<a name=254:15></a> I am dead; I have died; Christ is my life; He is all to me; am I, then, living as if He were all?<a name=254:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then we find a further thing, and that is, that Christ is unceasingly occupied about us.<a name=254:17></a> He suffered being tempted; it was a constant trial to Him, and yet He was perfect in it; the more He was tested, the more the odour of His good ointment came forth, and He was obedient unto death, even the death of the cross; such was the result produced by the exercises and trials of His heart.<a name=254:18></a>

		<a name=255>[Page 255]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So all the snares around us, the difficulties in the Church or in the family, are either the occasion of making us quail from the straight path, or they are the occasion of blessed obedience.<a name=255:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Gethsemane, observe, that the Lord says, Watch and pray lest ye enter, not into <i>sin</i>, but, into temptation.<a name=255:2></a> Christ was perfect through all, but Peter fell to cursing and swearing, and denied his Lord.<a name=255:3></a> If faith is tested by the way, we find also in the path that, "I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not".<a name=255:4></a> It was not a question of Peter's integrity, for he loved the Lord, but he did not know himself, and he had to be put through this process; yet before ever he had failed, Christ had prayed for him.<a name=255:5></a> And we know, beloved friends, that He ever liveth to make intercession for <i>us</i>.<a name=255:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is sometimes said, this means His appearing for us on the question of sin.<a name=255:7></a> It is nothing of the kind.<a name=255:8></a> Intercession is going and addressing yourself to a person, on behalf of another, to get anything you want for that one.<a name=255:9></a> It is the same word in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:26">Romans  8:26</a> and 34; the Spirit works in our hearts, but He does not appear anywhere for us.<a name=255:10></a> But Christ is standing in the presence of God, and He is the One who is actively engaged in obtaining for us all that we need.<a name=255:11></a> It is not that we go to Him, but that He goes to God for us.<a name=255:12></a> He is our righteousness there, He has made propitiation, and therefore He can use the grace that is in God, according to His knowledge of all that is in God, and of our weakness too, to bring down to us complete and needed grace.<a name=255:13></a> That is the place He is in, and He ever liveth to carry on this constant service on our behalf.<a name=255:14></a> He is our servant in that way.<a name=255:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When He was going away, He went to God He could not stay with them, to have blessing here with them as His companions.<a name=255:16></a> He must go away; and He went back as perfect as when He came.<a name=255:17></a> And, in <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>, knowing that He was going to God, He sets Himself to wash their feet.<a name=255:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having completed redemption, and washed ("bathed") us, there is something else that we need; therefore He says, "He that is washed ("<i>bathed"</i>, literally) needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit".<a name=255:19></a> If I look at God, as to my acceptance, I am as white as snow; but we do pick up dirt by the way, and we want our feet washed.<a name=255:20></a> The Lord insists on this, that Peter is perfect as to his person.<a name=255:21></a> But when Peter says, "Not my feet only, but also my hands and my head", the Lord does not wash his head.<a name=255:22></a> And so Christ is ever living

	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/James.htm#1">James  1</a>, the word "temptation" is used in both senses.<a name=260:12></a> When he says, "Count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations", he is speaking not of sin, but of trials and exercises.<a name=260:13></a> And again, when he says, "Every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed", we do not want sympathy with that.<a name=260:14></a> As I learn the evil of the flesh in me, I want to have it thoroughly judged, and so I say, "Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts".<a name=260:15></a> I want God to be with me as I am walking here in feeble faith; but when we fail, then intercession of another kind is needed to restore.<a name=260:16></a> We need Christ to be both strength and grace to us in the path of faith; and we go to the throne of grace with the consciousness that <i>there</i> is our righteousness -- propitiation -- and thus we can reckon on the constant grace of God to strengthen us.<a name=260:17></a>

		LECTURE ON @HEBREWS 9: 19 - 28
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two very distinct parts in this passage to the value of the sacrifice of Christ.<a name=262:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The one is its aspect towards God, and the other is its aspect towards us as sinners.<a name=262:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is the putting away of sin by the sacrifice of Himself; and then, He hath borne the sins of many.<a name=262:3></a> We find these two aspects running all through Scripture.<a name=262:4></a> Take the figure of the Old Testament.<a name=262:5></a> In <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#16">Leviticus  16</a>, on the day of atonement, the blood was carried in and put on the mercy-seat; this was the first goat, or, "the LORD's lot"; sins were then confessed on the head of the scapegoat by the high priest as representing the people, and afterwards these sins were carried away into a land not inhabited.<a name=262:6></a> This second goat dealt with actual sins and transgressions; but the former goat, or the LORD's lot, although in favour of sinners, surely had its direct aspect towards God.<a name=262:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another element there is here, on which, however, I do not stay, viz.<a name=262:8></a>, that Christ Himself has gone in, and is always there; that is, as is always the case in Hebrews, the truth is carried much further than the figure, for Christ is constantly in the presence of God for us.<a name=262:9></a> Not only has He done one work with regard to our standing before God, but He appears also in the presence of God for us.<a name=262:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a further element in the passage which has also its value and place, and that is, the "blood of the covenant" (verse 20).<a name=262:11></a> Not that there is any covenant made with us, but, as respects our relationship with God, it gives the fullest contrast between the first and second covenants.<a name=262:12></a> We get the blessings of the second covenant, though not exactly under it.<a name=262:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The great truth is, that we are in a state of sin before God.<a name=262:14></a> Everything is defiled where the creature has reached, everything even of heaven; I do not mean, of course, where God dwells in unapproachable light; but the created heavens regarded as part of the whole creation; and the angels also as well as the heavens.<a name=262:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Not that the heavens are guilty, but they are defiled; and therefore it is, that Christ has gone up "far above all heavens".<a name=262:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=263>[Page 263]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All that to which the creature has had to say, is defiled.<a name=263:1></a> If we look at God as dwelling, in a certain sense, in His creation, He sees the whole of it defiled; not indeed where He is in His own being and nature in unapproachable light; but there where He is in connection with His creatures, <i>there</i>, is defilement, and that does not do for God, for "Holiness becometh thy house, O LORD, for ever".<a name=263:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is in respect of this, that the great truth of the putting away of sin out of God's sight is made known to us; and then comes another thing: we are guilty, and our sins must also be put away.<a name=263:3></a> We have sinned.<a name=263:4></a> This is our place and condition, in the midst of the defiled creation.<a name=263:5></a> The whole evil must, therefore, be put out of God's sight, and this has taken place by the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=263:6></a> There is a purification for both, and Christianity teaches it in its own way: "Forthwith came there out blood and water".<a name=263:7></a> "This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood".<a name=263:8></a> Practical purifying is typified by water; and also, even under the law, "almost all things are .<a name=263:9></a>.<a name=263:10></a>.<a name=263:11></a> purged with blood".<a name=263:12></a> And not merely have we the renewing of our minds (which is another thing entirely), renewed in the knowledge of God, "in knowledge after the image of him that created him", but as there was sin in God's sight with which, of course, God has had to deal, so now all the dealings of God go upon that ground.<a name=263:13></a> No matter what the kind of dealing is?<a name=263:14></a> it is based upon the existence of sin.<a name=263:15></a> It must be so, because sin is here.<a name=263:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am not speaking now of believers who stand in grace, nor of God's righteousness which has come in; but I am looking at the ways and dealings of God, in judgment or in mercy, in atonement or in condemnation; all is in view of sin, because sin is here.<a name=263:17></a> We have surely thousands of mercies in regard to temporal things, but we have to look at things as men in the presence of God.<a name=263:18></a> In God's moral dealings with men, He must deal with respect to sin, because sin is here, or the dealings would not be true.<a name=263:19></a> It is of all importance that our hearts should get into the consciousness of this.<a name=263:20></a> We must either say that the world is fit, or else that it is unfit, for God.<a name=263:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If it is fit for God, what kind of God have we got?<a name=263:22></a>

		With corruption, murder, violence, oppression, horrible wickedness, wretchedness all around us, can we say that the world is fit for God?<a name=263:23></a> No person with a conscience, but will

		own it is not fit for God.<a name=264:1></a> Put it fairly before him, and he will own it.<a name=264:2></a> He might perhaps fly out against God, because of its state, or, that he should ever be punished for it, but he will never say that the world is fit for God as it is.<a name=264:3></a> And again, our hearts are not fit for God; that is a serious thing.<a name=264:4></a> No doubt a few leaves of a poisonous plant are not like a tree covered with fruit; and we may not grasp the whole value of this.<a name=264:5></a> As regards what was manifested, the Lord could look at it, but the whole condition of man is apart from God.<a name=264:6></a> At the first, we read that, "So he drove out the man"; and since then, every man has added his own sins, making up his own guilt.<a name=264:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We find, then, these two things: the state of the world before God, everything suffering from it and groaning together; and, in speaking of direct application to the conscience, our hearts also are away from God, and we never can be really in the truth with God until we own that.<a name=264:8></a> We may have many beautiful ideas in our heads, but to be with God, we must first take our place as sinners, just because we are such.<a name=264:9></a> There is not one of us, no matter who it is, but has done things his conscience condemns.<a name=264:10></a> And "if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things".<a name=264:11></a> Of course, a holy God must condemn us.<a name=264:12></a> That is where we find ourselves (I am not now speaking of the believer's place in Christ), and the word of God fully unfolds all this, and presses it upon us Nor shall we mend our position by deceiving ourselves, or by hiding ourselves from God, as Adam did in the garden, or by hiding God from ourselves.<a name=264:13></a> Not hiding absolutely, of course, for the sense of God will break in upon us sometimes, when anything unusual happens.<a name=264:14></a> A terrible disease rouses man to a consciousness of his position, and his conscience then sets to work at once.<a name=264:15></a> Bring cholera into the place, and at once you will have people religious.<a name=264:16></a> It expresses the sense that men have to do with God.<a name=264:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One there was who could say about a certain sin, that "the man that hath done this thing shall surely die"; and he gets answer from the prophet, "Thou art the man", though he had not the least conscience of it.<a name=264:18></a> There is no truth for us till we get before God in the consciousness of our <i>state</i> of sin, and also, that <i>we</i> have sinned, i.<a name=264:19></a>e.<a name=264:20></a>, that the tree has borne its fruit.<a name=264:21></a> It is not merely a generality, but it is intensely individual; <i>I</i> have to do with God, and <i>I</i> must be before Him according to all <i>I</i> have said and done.<a name=264:22></a>

		He was <i>there</i>, so that God might be glorified in righteousness, glorified in His majesty, glorified in truth, glorified in love, by Christ putting Himself in the place of sin, Himself sinless, and by His being tested and proved all His life through; He is "the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world".<a name=273:4></a> Not the sins, as it is too often wrongly quoted, but "the sin"; if He had taken away the sins, what would there be left to judge man for?<a name=273:5></a> But with respect to <i>all</i>, God says, I am glorified.<a name=273:6></a> Christ hath appeared "once in the end of the world .<a name=273:7></a>.<a name=273:8></a>.<a name=273:9></a> to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself".<a name=273:10></a> He annulled sin completely, in the sight of God, by perfect obedience in His own Person, taking the whole thing upon Him, and dying as "made sin" for us, so that God has not one word more to say; on the contrary, He can now accomplish the full result of active blessing in the immutable stability of the new heavens and the new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness.<a name=273:11></a> All things will be reconciled (not the things cast out under the earth, I do not speak of them now), in heaven and on earth, and a new heaven and a new earth will be brought in, founded upon the death of Christ, the One who is the delight of God for ever.<a name=273:12></a> Christ's work must ever be God's delight, because through that work God has been perfectly glorified in all that He is.<a name=273:13></a> And the point is, that there where Christ was "made sin", <i>there</i>, has God been glorified.<a name=273:14></a>

		Inasmuch as God has been perfectly glorified, the testimony of the blood of Christ goes out <i>now</i> to the sinner, and says, 'Grace is free, grace reigns through righteousness'; while as to the full result of it, this will include "new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness".<a name=274:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards ourselves, we know the work is done, and that, consequently, Man sits at the right hand of God.<a name=274:4></a> We have also the testimony of the Holy Ghost that so completely and so perfectly has this work of God been done by Christ on the cross, that man in Him has been already glorified by God.<a name=274:5></a> Not, of course, that we are there yet, but our "Forerunner" is entered.<a name=274:6></a> For His own work's sake, Christ is now glorified in answer to His words in <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>, "I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.<a name=274:7></a> And now, O Father, glorify thou me".<a name=274:8></a> Now He sits at the right hand of God in glory.<a name=274:9></a> But He will come again to judge His enemies, as it is written, "Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool".<a name=274:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the application of all this, I see that not merely God has been glorified, but also that my case has been met as a sinner.<a name=274:11></a> At the close of this chapter, we read, "As it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: so Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many".<a name=274:12></a> Sin has brought in both death and judgment.<a name=274:13></a> Death has actually come in, and judgment is before man.<a name=274:14></a> So that, in this passage, I see that not merely the great general basis and foundation has been laid in God's work on the cross (not on man's responsibility, for the eternal glory rests upon the finished work of the "second Man", and it can therefore never fail), but also that conscience has been dealt with.<a name=274:15></a> "<i>As</i> it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:" -- that is where we are as sinners -- "so Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many".<a name=274:16></a> Death came in by sin, and judgment also comes by sin.<a name=274:17></a> Judgment applies to my works.<a name=274:18></a> But I find here that God having come in, not only has Christ glorified God, but He has also confessed, as it were, my sins, my evil works, upon the head of the scapegoat, and thus they are gone for ever.<a name=274:19></a>

		The immediate object is the setting aside of Judaism, for now that we have the true circumcision, we are viewed as complete in Him.<a name=280:4></a> Circumcision does not go beyond the putting off of the body of the flesh, either historically or in Colossians; it does not go beyond "putting off" (chapter 2: 11).<a name=280:5></a> But though this is only negative, it is a big negative.<a name=280:6></a>

		Israel had no one for them in Canaan, but we have Someone in the heavens.<a name=280:9></a> Until we are in Christ, and Christ in us, I do not believe we can be really circumcised, for I cannot reckon the body dead until I have got some other life.<a name=280:10></a> Life must come before death.<a name=280:11></a> That is the controversy we have with monks, and with the Irvingites; they said, death must come first; we said, life first.<a name=280:12></a> We cannot reckon ourselves dead to sin until we have another life in which to reckon ourselves.<a name=280:13></a> The apostle is insisting that we are complete in Christ -- Christ complete before God, and we in Him.<a name=280:14></a>

		READING ON @EPHESIANS 3
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is striking how the gospel of Paul and the doctrine of the Church run into one another.<a name=291:1></a> They are distinguished somewhat more in Colossians, where Paul speaks of himself as a minister of the Church as well as of the gospel, i.<a name=291:2></a>e.<a name=291:3></a>, he was a teacher <i>of</i> it, and not merely, as with many others, a teacher <i>in</i> it.<a name=291:4></a> <i>Here</i>, they both run together; so we read "that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs, and of the same body", and the gospel Paul preached was to bring this about.<a name=291:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What makes this so immensely important is, that is involves sovereign grace.<a name=291:6></a> For, as regards his state, it did not matter much whether a man were Jew or Gentile; in reality, both Jew and Gentile were far off; but the Jew had promises which God, of course, could not fail to fulfil, and Christ was therefore "a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers", and also, "that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy;" <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#15:8">Romans  15:8</a>, 9.<a name=291:7></a> The Jews came thus under pure mercy because they had rejected Christ; still, God is faithful, and promises were there to be fulfilled.<a name=291:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We read, too, that "if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed", <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#3:29">Galatians  3:29</a>.<a name=291:9></a> In <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2:3">Ephesians  2:3</a>, all are viewed alike, white in verse 12 the contrast is fully expressed.<a name=291:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The great principle of it is the sovereign grace I have referred to; it treats man not only as dead in sins, as in Ephesians, but also it brings out that man, looked at as alive, is at hopeless enmity to God.<a name=291:14></a> Of course, morally speaking, he is dead, but looked at as active, there is in him positive enmity to goodness.<a name=291:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This was proved by the law, though not then brought out; for the law was presented to men to keep, but "the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death".<a name=291:16></a> And this is not all, for before Paul began his ministry another element came out, viz.<a name=291:17></a>, that in this world of sinners and lawbreakers

	<div class="paragraph">
		Sinners they were in full, and positive transgressors, too, but though God was in Christ reconciling the world unto Himself, men would not have Him: "Now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father".<a name=292:3></a> There had been thus a full revelation of the Father in grace in the Son; "If I had not done among them the works which none other man did", etc.<a name=292:4></a>, and they had hated Him.<a name=292:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		After this came the apostles, and in Peter's ministry there was this additional element, viz.<a name=292:6></a>, that Christ's intercession ("Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do") had spared the Jews.<a name=292:7></a> A certain respite was given them; but in stoning Stephen they sent, to use the Lord's figure, a message after the Lord to say that "we will not have this man to reign over us".<a name=292:8></a> Instead of repenting, they put Stephen to death and stopped the apostles' mouths; and here for the first time we find Saul, holding the clothes of those who were killing Stephen.<a name=292:9></a> The distinct expression of their enmity, as well as the whole energy of it, was brought out in the clearest way in Saul of Tarsus.<a name=292:10></a>

		There are in Scripture two simple positions for a Christian; the one is, my acceptance in Christ.<a name=305:13></a> In myself, I am a lost sinner, and a man that is lost is not on probation; I have given myself up as on that ground, and the only part I have in what saves me, is my sins, and the enmity that killed Christ.<a name=305:14></a>

		Anxiety as to this is met by constant dependence, and by constant confidence.<a name=305:20></a> By dependence, for I can do nothing without Christ.<a name=305:21></a> If in any measure I have lost sight of Christ, it is all wrong; on the other hand, I have this certainty: "I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee".<a name=305:22></a> I am kept by the power of God through faith, but then this shows that I need to be kept, and it proves the danger, too.<a name=305:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle Paul is here telling Timothy how to preach the gospel.<a name=307:1></a> Compare the language of the commission in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:46">Luke  24:46</a> - 48, with <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1:8">Acts  1:8</a> and chapter 2: 36 - 38.<a name=307:2></a> In carrying out the commission -- "repent and be baptised" -- Peter told the Jews that they had crucified Christ, and they were brought to repentance, pricked to the heart; and we have Paul, in his preaching at Antioch, taking the same kind of ground, "I will give you the sure mercies of David", and, "Through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13">Acts  13</a>.<a name=307:3></a> It was in the main the same kind of thing.<a name=307:4></a>

		It was a warning to the Jews, then and there, lest they should perish.<a name=307:8></a> We find very much the same thing in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#26">Acts  26</a>, "To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light", "and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance".<a name=307:9></a> That is what Paul was telling them to do; so that, whether Jews or Gentiles, it would be turning them from the power of Satan unto God.<a name=307:10></a> The thing he was bringing before them was repentance.<a name=307:11></a> In the beginning of Romans it is the same thing to the Gentiles, though perhaps more vague.<a name=307:12></a> Peter also preached Jesus and the resurrection, and called upon them all to repent.<a name=307:13></a> That was his gospel message.<a name=307:14></a>

		Yes, I should, for I do not believe people ever have <i>settled</i> peace until they have that; we do not know the gospel fully, until we are made the righteousness of God in Christ.<a name=308:6></a> But the theologians, when they have the forgiveness of sins, go back to the fulfilling of the law, and that they call, "<i>going on</i>"!<a name=308:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=308:8></a> Where do you put repentance?<a name=308:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, it is to be preached in Christ's name, and we must bring in Christ as the ground of it -- that is really grace.<a name=308:10></a> Repentance is the intelligent judgment that, under grace, we pass upon all that we have done, and upon all that we are.<a name=308:11></a> It is not mere sorrow for sin, for when they were pricked to the heart, Peter set them to repent.<a name=308:12></a> It must be, of course, a judgment passed upon ourselves in the knowledge of what God is, or else it would evidently be incomplete.<a name=308:13></a> It must involve, too, that the claims of God are considered.<a name=308:14></a> The peculiar character of much of the gospel preaching nowadays, is, that it presents God as a kind of debtor to the world to save it, and that He must try and get people to pay Him the compliment of believing on Him.<a name=308:15></a> Repentance says, 'I am lost, and unless I repent, and believe, I shall be lost entirely'.<a name=308:16></a>

		Ques.<a name=308:17></a> Did the prodigal repent, when he "came to himself"?<a name=308:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Yes, so far.<a name=308:19></a> Repentance is more than a change of mind; it is a change of mind, but it is also the judgment of what has gone before which a change of mind leads us to.<a name=308:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Yes, and repentance is to be preached in <i>Christ's</i> name.<a name=308:23></a> A repentance that simply says, 'I have done this, and I shall be damned for it', is just a legal repentance -- what Romanists call attrition, not contrition.<a name=308:24></a> I preach Christ, but I call upon men to repent.<a name=308:25></a>

		It is very striking to see how Paul goes back and down to natural associations, and also the way in which he does so; he departs here from the fulness of the doctrine usual to him, and becomes both private and personal; "whom I serve from my forefathers", "thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice" -- both Jewesses; he is occupied more with personal relationships than with dispensational thoughts.<a name=317:1></a> His service, he says, is with a pure conscience, just as when he was smitten on the face; <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#23:1">Acts  23:1</a>, 2.<a name=317:2></a> And we find here Timothy's gift was by the putting on of Paul's hands.<a name=317:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Responsibility is unfolded in the history of the first man, and that responsibility closes in the cross, where it is proved that God can get no good out of man at all; each one of us has to learn this lesson.<a name=321:2></a> I learn that I am a sinner, that I cannot keep the law of God, and that I do not care for Christ.<a name=321:3></a> Looking at the ways and dealings of God, the probation of man, as man, was over at the cross, and since then God treats him as lost.<a name=321:4></a> A lost man is no longer under probation; he has been under it, but that is now a thing settled and past.<a name=321:5></a> God is now gathering together in one all things in Christ, and He begins with the church.<a name=321:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is an exceedingly important thing to see that the responsibility of the creature, the authority of God, and the judgment of God in righteousness are all maintained.<a name=321:7></a> These questions had been raised in the garden of Eden.<a name=321:8></a> Promise came in afterwards to Abraham, promise without any condition at all.<a name=321:9></a> In the garden we have Adam and the two trees of life and responsibility; then the law takes up responsibility, and puts life after the accomplishment of it.<a name=321:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These two trees or principles can never be taken up and reconciled until we come to Christ.<a name=321:11></a> They are brought together again in Christ, and then we find that He has stood for us in circumstances of failed responsibility, and further that He has brought in life.<a name=321:12></a> Divine counsels can now come out which were there before the world existed.<a name=321:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Just see what has come out in the gospel of the glory!<a name=321:14></a> (chapter 1: 9, 10).<a name=321:15></a> We now are in a new position of responsibility, for saints have to act up to the position they are in.<a name=321:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Whilst the law never went beyond the duty of man, the Christian's path goes on the ground of the likeness of God: "Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children".<a name=321:17></a> All these truths coming out was, so to speak, like the flowing tide with the apostles.<a name=321:18></a> "All the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us".<a name=321:19></a>

		Well now, instead of this, we see here that Paul has to get back to Timothy's grandmother Lois; the tide was going the other way.<a name=321:20></a> He was greatly pressed in spirit, no doubt, but still he says it will not do to give way.<a name=321:21></a> It may be there was even anxiety in his mind about Timothy himself, anyway he thought good to exhort him.<a name=321:22></a>

		And this position is one which we have fairly to look in the face.<a name=322:1></a> God has brought out afresh this truth of the glory of the church, and simple minds see it to be so.<a name=322:2></a> One who recently came to a reading meeting from across the water, after listening a while, said, 'I see what it is plainly enough, Paul's testimony has been completely lost, and brought out again'.<a name=322:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, I see Christ on the cross working redemption, next, on the Father's throne giving the Holy Ghost, and, lastly, as coming again.<a name=322:4></a> The result of the first, viz.<a name=322:5></a>, justification by faith, was recovered at the Reformation; but Christ's sitting at the right hand of God and sending the Holy Ghost was then totally ignored; and the Lord's coming was wholly rejected as Jewish.<a name=322:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These two last truths it is that God has now brought out; that while Christ is sitting on the Father's throne, the Holy Ghost is down here, and is gathering out a people in connection with Christ, and to whom the Lord will come again and receive to Himself.<a name=322:7></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One is often grieved that Christians around us do not get hold of that which God is bringing out; on the other hand, it is Satan's effort to hinder them, and to raise a cloud of dust and prejudice against it.<a name=322:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The two thoughts are found distinctly here; the counsels of God as characterising the position, and then, the enduring right through to the end.<a name=322:16></a> Therefore there must be more and more of individual faith, "unfeigned faith".<a name=322:17></a> The One whom he had believed remained always as an object before Paul.<a name=322:18></a> And he was suffering because he was carrying this out.<a name=322:19></a> Nevertheless, he knew whom he had believed.<a name=322:20></a> 'I have laid up all my

		No; I take it that the obedience of Jesus Christ is not merely that there is a rule given, but rather is it, "Lo, I come to do thy will, O God".<a name=337:21></a> There was in Him a whole life which had no spring of action except the will of God, and if there was no will of God, He did nothing.<a name=337:22></a> At the beginning the Lord says, as it were, to Satan, 'I am come to live by the word of God'.<a name=337:23></a> He could, of course, have turned the stones into bread, but He had not the will of God for doing this, and so He did nothing.<a name=337:24></a>

		John had seen Christ standing in the midst of the golden candlesticks; chapter 1.<a name=359:2></a> Then "the things which are" follow (chapters 2 and 3); from chapter 4 and onwards, we have "the things which shall be hereafter", or after these.<a name=359:3></a>

		There is the divine character of Christ, and also the ecclesiastical character of Christ.<a name=359:4></a> He is seen here in judgment, not in blessing flowing down in gifts and so on.<a name=359:5></a> He forms His own judgment of the state of the churches, and He gives promises to overcomers.<a name=359:6></a> He is judging their state, with His garment flowing down to the feet, not tucked up to serve.<a name=359:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thing to note in connection with this, is, that we have not any directions given by the Spirit of God to guide the church as to what it is to do, save as listening to the judgment of Christ about the church; but that is not direction to the church.<a name=359:8></a>

		Passing by the numbering of the people and the redemption of the firstborn, we might begin with the laws and appointments of chapter 5; they were to keep the camp holy -- put out the leper, and so on -- "that they defile not their camps, in the midst whereof I dwell".<a name=373:1></a> God's dwelling with them was on the ground of redemption, and He never dwelt with man until redemption was accomplished; but now the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.<a name=373:2></a> God had never dwelt with Abraham, but as soon as redemption was accomplished, He said, "I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God", <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#29:45">Exodus  29:45</a>.<a name=373:3></a>

		Ques.<a name=373:4></a> Was not God in the pillar of cloud before the tabernacle was set up?<a name=373:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Yes, but this was after redemption.<a name=373:6></a> And it is the same now, only that it is the Holy Ghost indwelling us, the habitation of God through the Spirit which God still insists shall be kept holy.<a name=373:7></a> He met Moses between the cherubim; but here it is, "I will meet with the children of Israel, and the tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory".<a name=373:8></a> And the different ordinances and sacrifices offered were founded upon the truth that God was there.<a name=373:9></a> An immense thing this was, but now it is a fact by the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven.<a name=373:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=373:11></a> In <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#7:89">Numbers  7:89</a>, Moses "heard the voice of one speaking unto him from off the mercy-seat that was upon the ark of testimony"?<a name=373:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have no doubt it has.<a name=374:7></a> Only his action took place before the tabernacle was set up.<a name=374:8></a> He took his tent and pitched it afar off, outside the camp.<a name=374:9></a> That was something special to Moses, as it says, "With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the LORD shall he behold", <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#12">Numbers  12</a>.<a name=374:10></a> That was when the cloudy pillar descended, and God talked with Moses outside the camp.<a name=374:11></a> There, too, we find Joshua again.<a name=374:12></a> Joshua departed not out of the tabernacle of the congregation; Moses also kept there, saving when he went into the camp to carry God's messages.<a name=374:13></a> As yet, the tabernacle had not been made, but when Moses gets outside the camp, he gives to the tent this name.<a name=374:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=374:15></a> Was it Moses' own tent?<a name=374:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Yes, I suppose so, or a tent.<a name=374:17></a> Coming down from the mountain with directions for the tabernacle, he found the golden calf there and he smashed the tables of the law; then he went up and obtained mercy for the people.<a name=374:18></a> But he also took the tent and pitched it outside the camp.<a name=374:19></a>

		In two cases this was so, they were treated as an unclean thing; but the fat of these was burnt upon the brazen altar.<a name=374:22></a> It was an additional element in the sacrifice.<a name=374:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When they had made the camp unclean with their idolatry, Moses could not take the law of God down to that state of things; he could not put such a law alongside the calf, and, as he did not know what to do, he smashed the tables beneath the mount, so that as a written law it never reached man at all.<a name=374:24></a> Then Moses goes up and obtains the mercy of God.<a name=374:25></a> Christ went outside Jerusalem, though it was the holy city.<a name=374:26></a>

		Yes.<a name=376:11></a> It is easier to speak about evil.<a name=376:12></a> The Edomites could say, 'Down with it' because it was God's city; and on the other hand, priests were saying, "The temple of the LORD, are these".<a name=376:13></a> The professing church takes the one side, even Papists own the Holy Ghost and that Christ died for sinners; but Edomites, i.<a name=376:14></a>e.<a name=376:15></a>, infidels, seek to pull down everything.<a name=376:16></a> In view of all that, I could not sit with the mockers, and rejoice; that would not do.<a name=376:17></a> Papists hold more truth than most Protestants, yet I cannot go with them; I cannot walk with either.<a name=376:18></a> Other things there are, too; take, say, the Establishment, with the world and the Church mixed up all together, a great system with a profession to be one body, which the world recognises, and which takes in unconverted people avowedly; <i>there</i> I do not find separation of the precious from the vile; but dross, if it is dross, I reject as such.<a name=376:19></a> I have to make the difference and lay hold of whatever is precious, and this I accept and own.<a name=376:20></a> I have no doubt we are in the last days, and our business is with the precious.<a name=376:21></a> But then we have that which is of great moment: "Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name".<a name=376:22></a> The word of God becomes that which is eaten and digested into the soul, and which gives me the consciousness so far of what is precious and of what is vile.<a name=376:23></a> If we turn to <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#3">2 Timothy  3</a>, we shall find the same thing.<a name=376:24></a> There it is not crying out against the evil.<a name=376:25></a> We are now in these last days, and verses 2 - 5 are true all around us; so the instruction given to us is, "From such turn away".<a name=376:26></a> Paul then speaks of the mischief they do, and he tells us that "all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.<a name=376:27></a> But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived".<a name=376:28></a> He further appeals to Timothy to continue in the things he has learned and has been assured of, knowing from whom he had learned them (we now have them

		That may happen, for God can apply the word, but that is not washing one another's feet, for that is active individual service.<a name=399:24></a> But, in <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>, the Lord is sitting with the disciples as their companion in the world, and there, knowing that the glory was His and that He was going to it, in the perfect holiness of His nature He says to Peter, "If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me".<a name=399:25></a> I am going away, but I am <i>not</i> going to give you up, I must have you with me where I go, and dirty feet will not do for heaven.<a name=399:26></a>

		READINGS ON JOSHUA (READING NO. 1)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a difference between Numbers and Joshua.<a name=400:1></a> Numbers is, in its principle, the testing of man down here in the wilderness; we are viewed typically as redeemed Christians, but still in the wilderness, and tested.<a name=400:2></a> Joshua is, in figure, divine energy getting rid of Satan; while at the same time everything depended upon the state in which Israel was.<a name=400:3></a> It is not, in itself, the testing of man's state, though that did get tested, too.<a name=400:4></a> If they were not in a faithful state they did not obtain the victory.<a name=400:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the point in Joshua was not their testing; <i>that</i> was the business of the desert.<a name=400:6></a> In Joshua, having passed over Jordan, Israel is the Lord's host connected with Canaan, i.<a name=400:7></a>e.<a name=400:8></a>, with the heavenly places.<a name=400:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To shew the distinction, look at <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#8">Deuteronomy  8</a>for the character of the wilderness: "Thou shalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments, or no.<a name=400:10></a> And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live.<a name=400:11></a> Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell, these forty years.<a name=400:12></a> Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth his son, so the LORD thy God chasteneth thee" (verses 1 - 5).<a name=400:13></a> And again, "Who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness, wherein were fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where there was no water; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint; who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not, that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end" (verses 15, 16).<a name=400:14></a> All that was a process going on on God's part with the <i>people</i>, but in Joshua it was a conflict engaged with the enemies of God, only, of course, we must remember that, collaterally, it did try the people also.<a name=400:15></a>

		No, though that might come out there.<a name=401:18></a>

		Notice that the wilderness was no part of God's purpose at all; Canaan was, and the very object of God's purpose was to bring the people into the land of Canaan.<a name=401:19></a> Quite true, enemies were there, and that so far tested the faithfulness of the people when they reached the land; but in the wilderness God tested the faithfulness of the people; while in Canaan they are God's host, they are looked at as dead and risen again and in the heavenly places.<a name=401:20></a> In Colossians, we are not yet out of the wilderness; in Ephesians, we are in Canaan.<a name=401:21></a> But it is a great thing to see that the wilderness forms no part of God's purpose at all.<a name=401:22></a> Of course, God knew what He was going to do, but in the wilderness we have the ways of God, not His purpose.<a name=401:23></a> His purpose was first of all redemption, but this redemption was complete when they had passed the Red Sea.<a name=401:24></a> The whole thing was then settled: "Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed".<a name=401:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There was also the judgment of the Egyptians at the Red Sea.<a name=401:26></a> The Lord could thus take the poor thief straight to Paradise without any wilderness at all.<a name=401:27></a> In <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1">Colossians  1</a>it is, "Which <i>hath made us</i> meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light".<a name=401:28></a> But then, in the wilderness, redeemed, there is a great deal to correct and learn, even if there is life.<a name=401:29></a>

		Look at chapters 3, 6 and 15 of Exodus, and you will see that there is no wilderness at all in God's purpose".<a name=402:2></a> The LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows; And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites".<a name=402:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That was God's purpose, that was what He had come down for; there is here no hint of the wilderness.<a name=402:4></a> It is the same in chapter 6, "I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with great judgments: And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God; and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.<a name=402:5></a> And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it to you for an heritage; I am the LORD" (verses 6 - 8).<a name=402:6></a> That is out of Egypt into the land of Canaan, and no thought of the wilderness.<a name=402:7></a> That was God's purpose, and He tells them He is going to do as He had said.<a name=402:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 15 faith takes up all this, like a soul often does now when redeemed and full of joy, but not knowing what lies before it; "Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation.<a name=402:9></a> The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#42:402">footnote</a></i>).<a name=402:10></a> Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed", and so on.<a name=402:11></a> There is no wilderness at all.<a name=402:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord shews us the completeness of redemption in taking the thief beside Him on the cross and carrying Him straight to Paradise, fit to be Christ's companion; for that, the work was all complete <i>in</i> him as well as <i>for</i> him.<a name=402:13></a> And he owns Christ when the disciples ran away.<a name=402:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Nobody could carry the Ark but priests (Levites), and in doing it they are identified with Christ in spirit and in heart.<a name=417:15></a> Yet there was to be "a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure; come not near unto it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go: for ye have not passed this way heretofore".<a name=417:16></a> There could be no passing the Jordan unless the Ark went first into it, because death is the judgment for sin; it is that in Christ, and then it is salvation to us; but the Ark goes first and does the whole thing, i.<a name=417:17></a>e.<a name=417:18></a>, Christ really dries up the whole way across, and that makes Jordan entrance into Canaan, instead of shutting the people out of it.<a name=417:19></a> It is a blessed thing to see that we have passed the Jordan, that our place in Christ is beyond all -- beyond sin, beyond death, beyond the devil's power, beyond judgment, and in a way, beyond the world of which Satan is the prince.<a name=417:20></a>

		LECTURE ON @1 JOHN 5: 1 - 13
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first verses of this chapter have a special character and that is, the testing and searching out what the true love of the brethren is, and then the apostle goes on to the great basis of Christian walk as set out in certain testimony which we shall presently see.<a name=453:1></a> As we are aware, in this epistle, the love of the brethren is that which characterises the Christian.<a name=453:2></a> It is one of two things, the other being obedience to Christ's words and commandments -- the spirit of obedience and the spirit of love to the brethren.<a name=453:3></a> In speaking of loving the brethren, he shews us who these are, they are "born of God", and such we love.<a name=453:4></a> Dependence on God, obedience, and love are the characteristics of divine love.<a name=453:5></a> Variously developed in us they surely are, but we find them all in perfection in Christ.<a name=453:6></a> "Man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live".<a name=453:7></a> There we have dependence.<a name=453:8></a> This has a double character.<a name=453:9></a> You have a strength that you cannot do without even though you are not dependent; and besides this, there is confidence in the strength provided.<a name=453:10></a> The Blessed Lord having made Himself a servant, we find in Him both dependence and obedience; and also love which was in Him the principle of activity.<a name=453:11></a> In us, it is mixed with imperfection, but it is the same thing in itself.<a name=453:12></a> This epistle treats especially of these two traits, namely, obedience to the commandments and love of the brethren.<a name=453:13></a> They manifest divine life in us, and they are always inseparable, because love to the brethren must have, after all, its eye upon God.<a name=453:14></a> It was so with Christ in everything.<a name=453:15></a> He gave Himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to <i>God</i>.<a name=453:16></a> He did love us, but it was to God, and God was the object of His service; and therefore, when going to the cross, He says, "That the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do".<a name=453:17></a> There we see the principle of love and of obedience.<a name=453:18></a> These two are inseparable.<a name=453:19></a> So you have those who are dear to Christ, but along with that the path of obedience, or it is not the path of real love.<a name=453:20></a> Love that is not obedient is never divine love.<a name=453:21></a> I cannot have divine love in my heart and not refer to God.<a name=453:22></a> When Christ came as a man, He never went out of the place of
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=454>[Page 454]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		obedience.<a name=454:1></a> So with us; where they are true, these two things are inseparable, and if they are not true, they are not it at all.<a name=454:2></a> Just as a man has a body and a soul, but the moment they are separated, neither is a man.<a name=454:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the apostle gives us the mark of the brethren, "Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God", and he adds, "Every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him".<a name=454:4></a> Love to the brethren is characteristic.<a name=454:5></a> I ought to love every poor sinner, but love to the brethren flows from a specific relationship, which shews the value of what Christ loves.<a name=454:6></a> It is not here the activity of evangelising grace, but that which is distinctive in that a certain set of people are loved for the sake of another to whom they are dear, whatever their own individual character may be; and therefore it cannot be outside obedience.<a name=454:7></a> "This commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also".<a name=454:8></a> Who are they?<a name=454:9></a> All God's children, "whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ", etc.<a name=454:10></a> Then you get a counter check, and in this way, "By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments".<a name=454:11></a> It is not loving a certain set of people we may know, but loving the children of God as such, because I keep His commandments; I know I love the brethren because I love God.<a name=454:12></a> Both sides are checked in this way, and very important it is.<a name=454:13></a> Practically, I may find one is more agreeable than another, and I have more fellowship of heart with one than with another, and so on, and there is nothing wrong in this, if there is more suitability the one to the other; but still I love <i>all</i>, even though the more abundantly I love, the less I be loved, and that is because of the character of the love.<a name=454:14></a> The characteristic of God's love is that, in its strength, its purpose, its activity, and its energy, all is dependent upon the love that loves, not upon the object loved.<a name=454:15></a> "God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us".<a name=454:16></a> The great, immense, proving, revealing act of the love of God is, that Christ died for us while we were yet sinners.<a name=454:17></a> There is often a difference of communion between the soul and God, but still the love is characterised by this, that it does not flow from the object loved, but from the heart of Him who loves.<a name=454:18></a> With my heart and mind thinking of God and looking to God, whatever belongs to Him is dear to me just because it is of God.<a name=454:19></a> "Every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of

		him".<a name=455:1></a> If I am extremely attached to a person, I love his children, and not merely because his children are pleasant.<a name=455:2></a> But if I love others as God's children, it is proved and shewn to be love to them as such, because we are obedient to God Himself; but it is not the love of God to His children if it is not marked by the spirit of obedience.<a name=455:3></a> The two things are inseparable.<a name=455:4></a> I love the children because they are God's children, and if I love God I keep His commandments.<a name=455:5></a> This is just the spirit of the Christian, that Christ being precious to him, love to the brethren <i>and</i> the path of obedience are always before him, and therefore also he is really pleasing himself.<a name=455:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, then, he next turns to where difficulties are found.<a name=455:7></a> "His commandments are not grievous".<a name=455:8></a> To the natural man they are exceedingly grievous, for "the carnal mind .<a name=455:9></a>.<a name=455:10></a>.<a name=455:11></a> is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be".<a name=455:12></a> The only thought that the flesh has about these commandments is that it must never have anything its own way.<a name=455:13></a> Whether child or old man, each one of us likes his own will.<a name=455:14></a> Doing my own will is not obedience.<a name=455:15></a> But love to God makes His will the motive of my conduct.<a name=455:16></a> When we speak of Christ's obedience as the pattern of ours, as to its spring, it is not in that way that the law deals with man.<a name=455:17></a> There is a certain character of obedience in all of us which is submission to another's will when we do not like it.<a name=455:18></a> You see a child, who wants to run out and play, sit down at his father's bidding to do his lessons; very nice it is to see such obedience, but Christ never obeyed in that way.<a name=455:19></a> He never had a will one way, and then gave it up to do His Father's in another way.<a name=455:20></a> And the "new man" lives by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.<a name=455:21></a> It delights in obedience, and therefore, in the epistle of James, God's will is called the perfect law of liberty, because if I tell my child to run our and play, instead of sitting down to his lessons, it is obedience surely to do so, but it is also what his nature delights to do.<a name=455:22></a> The new nature is perfectly obedient, and finds its delight in that it obeys.<a name=455:23></a> In Christ, it was, "My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work".<a name=455:24></a> In us, we can trust God enough to wait for God to act; the new nature has not such an idea of its own importance that it sets about to act for itself before it has got a will from God.<a name=455:25></a>

		In the case of the Lord Jesus, in <a href="../bible/John.htm#11">John  11</a>, they sent to Him, saying, "Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick", but He abode two days still in the same place without stirring.<a name=455:26></a> He

		Very useful is the law to convict, but it is too late, for man, the being to whom it applies, is already lost, and Christ came to save the lost.<a name=459:2></a> If a man has lost every farthing, and you give him a rule to shew him how to employ his money, 'Why, says he, you mock me, I have no money'.<a name=459:3></a> Your rule may be useful to convict him of the fact.<a name=459:4></a> Now all Christians will say, in terms, that man is lost, and yet they will speak of him as under probation.<a name=459:5></a> In one sense the Christian, when under grace, is in probation, but man, as such, has been tested and probation is over.<a name=459:6></a> Even one of old could say, "Enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man living be justified".<a name=459:7></a> That is all settled.<a name=459:8></a> "By works of law no flesh shall be justified".<a name=459:9></a> "As many as are of the works of the law are under the curse".<a name=459:10></a> That does not mean bad works, but such that are on that principle, for they have not kept the law.<a name=459:11></a> But God being fully revealed, the question now is as to whether I can walk in the light as God is in the light; it is not whether I have walked by the law rightly, but am I in a state to stand before Him?<a name=459:12></a> And I know I am not.<a name=459:13></a> The day of judgment is anticipated in the conscience, and I "cannot answer him one of a thousand".<a name=459:14></a> Job owns that God loves righteousness, but "if I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean; yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me".<a name=459:15></a> That is to say, if I fancy I am right, He shall plunge me in the ditch -- shew me what I am -- and I shall come out of it, so that my own clothes shall abhor me; <a href="../bible/Job.htm#9">Job  9</a>.<a name=459:16></a>

		This character of cleansing we find in Ephesians: "Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word; that he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing".<a name=460:9></a> "<i>To himself</i>!<a name=460:10></a>" And fit <i>for Himself</i>!<a name=460:11></a>!<a name=460:12></a> The word brings down to us the nature and character, the glory and purity, and the blessedness, too, of the place it comes from.<a name=460:13></a> If I may so speak, Christ has in a way humanised it; but man would not have it, and just because it was such, they refused it, and Him too; they spat in His face and crucified Him.<a name=460:14></a> So now God comes in, in power and grace, so as not to leave one atom of flesh in His presence; we find many other details besides, but this has taken place, and the moment I see this, I am entitled to say, "I am dead".<a name=460:15></a>
