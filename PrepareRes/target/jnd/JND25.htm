		COMPARED VIEW OF THE FIRST THREE GOSPELS, ETC. -- PART 2
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I now turn to Luke.<a name=1:1></a> It is remarkable how this Gospel brings out the moral condition of things in their various phases, and first of Israel in the days in which the Lord came.<a name=1:2></a> We have first the whole status of Judaism most clearly and graphically presented.<a name=1:3></a> In the body of the Gospel Luke gives us in general the Son of man, and the great moral principles of relationship between man and God.<a name=1:4></a> But for this reason, before this begins, he pictures to us very fully the state of Judaism by itself, and all the blessings which remained to the faithful in it: Herod (an Edomite) king of Judea -- the Jewish service going on in Davidical order; angels, ministers of God, His messengers to a godly priest, prophecy, and more than prophecy brought in according to promise; the house of David entering on the scene, but in poverty and low estate.<a name=1:5></a> Note, the explanation of the name of "Jesus," as saving His people, is not given, but He is the Son of the Highest.<a name=1:6></a> At the same time, He will have the throne of His father David.<a name=1:7></a> Next, as Haggai said, the Spirit remains among them, and acts in holy men and women according to ancient Jewish witness, such as Hannah in the desolations of Israel.<a name=1:8></a> Jewish hopes are prophetically sealed of God by prophecy.<a name=1:9></a> Chapter 1: 67-79.<a name=1:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Jews, at the same time, are under the dominion of the Gentiles, successors to those to whom Jerusalem had been delivered.<a name=1:11></a> They are disposed of at their will.<a name=1:12></a> Still the promise is sure, and its accomplishment announced by an angel to the poor of the flock.<a name=1:13></a> The heavens see further into this grace; there is goodwill toward, more exactly, God's good pleasure in, men.<a name=1:14></a> But the Jewish order is still there; the faithful accomplish the ordinances of the law, but they await with desire the fulfilment of the promise, and see it in Jesus.<a name=1:15></a> They know each other as a remnant.<a name=1:16></a> Anna spake of Him to all them who waited for redemption in Israel.<a name=1:17></a> Yet prophecy in the remnant sees well the place the new-born child is to hold in Israel.<a name=1:18></a> He is for the fall and for the rising again of many.<a name=1:19></a> Such is the scene presented in the first two chapters of Luke, and of which the other Gospels say nothing, while this is silent on all the royal question and Herod's effort to destroy Christ, Jesus coming up out of Egypt, the coming of the Gentiles to Israel's King, all which referred to God's dealings with Israel.<a name=1:20></a> Further, Christ is a real man; grows bodily and mentally, and in favour with God and man, in His gracious ways.<a name=1:21></a> But, child or not, His person was not changed.<a name=1:22></a> He depended on no outward mission to have it.<a name=1:23></a> At twelve years old, full of the power of His relationship, He is, with comely fitness and marvellous competency, occupied with His Father's business, yet returns into the human child's obedient place.<a name=1:24></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		After that comes the service.<a name=2:1></a> In the third chapter we enter on what is common to this Gospel and that of Matthew, but the form is very different.<a name=2:2></a> John's preaching, in Matthew, is repentance for the kingdom; in Luke, for the remission of sins.<a name=2:3></a> One feels the difference: one is dispensational, the other moral.<a name=2:4></a> So in Luke: "All flesh shall see the salvation of God.<a name=2:5></a>" It is not merely the Pharisees and Sadducees, but the multitude, who are a generation of vipers.<a name=2:6></a> So he gives the practically moral test to each class that comes to him.<a name=2:7></a> The result as to John, at least his imprisonment, is given at once.<a name=2:8></a> Christ is owned Son of God by the Father, and the Holy Ghost comes on Him.<a name=2:9></a> Here this part of the Gospel closes, and the Lord's genealogy comes in, not connected with these Jewish scenes and the promises of Abraham's and David's, but traced up to Adam, Son of God; introducing the great and, to us, all-important character of Son of man.<a name=2:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This makes us easily understand the reason why the genealogy is placed here, and the distinctive character of what precedes it.<a name=2:11></a> The whole Jewish condition is there, as we have seen, brought out with one little inlet into heaven, on Jesus coming into the world; and now we have His place as Son of man, One who, as representative of man according to divine perfection and counsels, is come to begin the new thing, and become the centre of the new creation.<a name=2:12></a> Only for that His death was needed for God's glory and our salvation.<a name=2:13></a> (Compare John 12: 23, 24.<a name=2:14></a>) But in His own moral perfectness we have the new thing.<a name=2:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The moment His being Son of man, descended according to the flesh from Adam, has been shewn, He is led to be put to the test by the enemy who had deceived the first Adam (chapter 4).<a name=2:16></a> This scene we have had as a fact in Mark, and detailed in Matthew, with this difference, that there it is given in historical, and, I may add, dispensational order; here in moral, the scriptural temptation by the Scriptures coming last.<a name=2:17></a> Hence Luke omits the sending away of Satan after the offer of the world and Satan's proposal that He should worship him.<a name=2:18></a> After this, the moral power of work and victory in obedience is noted in His returning in the power of the Spirit into Galilee.<a name=2:19></a> None of that power was lost; indeed, Christ not having failed in subjective obedience, the strong man was bound.<a name=2:20></a> Hence the first thing is not, as in Matthew, the manifestation of power, and then (attention being attracted) the description of the character suited to the kingdom; but the presentation of Himself in grace, the Spirit of the Lord being upon Him, He being therefore man.<a name=2:21></a> The gracious words told in their hearts; but in His own country He was, for them, Joseph's son -- such is the place of the Lord from heaven, the Son of man (last Adam) presented in grace to men and to Israel.<a name=2:22></a> Christ had already preached and acted in Capernaum: but the Spirit of God we see thus formally presents Him in Luke.<a name=2:23></a> And the Lord shews, that coming in sovereign grace sent from God, there was no limitation to Israel, as Elias went to Sarepta, and Naaman, the Syrian, was healed; while in either case many in Israel are left aside.<a name=2:24></a> Hence unbridled rage in His Jewish audience; but He was not subject to its power.<a name=2:25></a> This is all peculiar to Luke.<a name=2:26></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With the exception of displacing the calling of Andrew and Simon, as we shall see, Luke now follows the same order as Mark.<a name=3:1></a> First, His power over the enemy is shewn (chapter 4: 33-37); next, over diseases, and all that sin had brought in.<a name=3:2></a> This is the power He had in the world as having bound the strong man -- He could spoil all his goods, work an entire deliverance of man from Satan's power, and all its consequences in this world.<a name=3:3></a> But He seeks no witness to Himself, does not allow the devils to speak, and retires from the gaze and throng of men when His miracles had drawn their attention.<a name=3:4></a> He goes first into the desert, and then, when they would stay Him, pursues His work.<a name=3:5></a> This characterises His presence in the world.<a name=3:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord now begins to gather round Himself (chap 5).<a name=3:7></a> In Matthew, this gathering round Himself is brought in immediately He appears as the Light in Galilee, according to promise, preaching the kingdom; and then He goes round everywhere; and, when crowds follow Him, explains the character suited to the kingdom.<a name=3:8></a> Here, His mission and power as Son of man on the earth being shewn, He, though retiring from view, begins then to gather to Himself.<a name=3:9></a> It will be remarked, that we have a much fuller development of the way in which the disciples are called to follow Him in Luke.<a name=3:10></a> Simon hears the word in his ship.<a name=3:11></a> Christ works a miracle which reveals His person; the effect is just and deep conviction of sin in connection with that person.<a name=3:12></a> Then they leave all and follow Him.<a name=3:13></a> It is, I apprehend, Luke who changes the place of this.<a name=3:14></a> In that which immediately follows, he takes the same order as Mark.<a name=3:15></a> In Matthew we have the whole of this arranged according to subjects.<a name=3:16></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What characterises these facts in Luke is their being presented as the various displays of power in grace.<a name=4:1></a> First, Jesus heals that which Jehovah alone healed, the figure of sin as disease and defilement, which excluded from Jehovah's presence, and from communion with His people.<a name=4:2></a> He cleanses them from defilement.<a name=4:3></a> He charges the cleansed men to tell no man, but it is noised abroad.<a name=4:4></a> He heals all who come, but retires into the wilderness and prays.<a name=4:5></a> There is power and grace, but it is the Son of man.<a name=4:6></a> Next, doctors of the law and Pharisees were then there, and (an expression so fully shewing the situation) the power of the Lord (of Jehovah) was present to heal them.<a name=4:7></a> Faith brings the paralytic man; Jesus goes to the root of all evil in Israel (and everywhere), but here especially deals with it in respect of the government of God, and pardons the man's sins -- Jesus brings forgiveness.<a name=4:8></a> The word is, "The Son of man hath power on earth to forgive.<a name=4:9></a>" Yet it was the Jehovah of Psalm 103.<a name=4:10></a> Here "so seen in Israel" is omitted.<a name=4:11></a> Next, we find grace receiving the vile.<a name=4:12></a> He came to call sinners as a physician for their need.<a name=4:13></a> Grace was thus shewn in the midst of Israel, but on principles which went necessarily beyond it.<a name=4:14></a> Jesus receives sinners in grace, making all new.<a name=4:15></a> These cases, indeed, are common to the Gospels, whatever the order may be, and prominent in them as stamping a plain character on Christ's mission.<a name=4:16></a> Only Matthew, introduces the centurion's case where he places it, as especially shewing the bearing of the state Or things on the extension of grace to the Gentiles.<a name=4:17></a> The fact that, though in connection with Israel, the presence of the Lord and the principles here brought into view went necessarily farther, and could not be confined to the Jews definitely, is brought out in the question as to John's disciples, and the new wine and old bottles, etc.<a name=4:18></a>; the vessels must be new for the new power.<a name=4:19></a> But Luke adds here a moral principle not noticed in the other two Gospels; that human nature will like the old thing best.<a name=4:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This subject is pursued (chapter 6) in two remarkable cases as to the sabbath, the key-stone of Jewish ordinances: the case of David eating the shewbread -- the Son of man is Lord of the Sabbath; and the healing of the withered hand -- divine goodness rises above ordinances.<a name=5:1></a> Luke gives the facts more briefly than Mark.<a name=5:2></a> Matthew puts them much farther on in the history, where they are connected with the rejection of Israel.<a name=5:3></a> The first of these cases presents the position of the rejected King whose need was above ordinances, and whose condition really abrogated them; adding that, as Son of man, consequently, He was Lord of the sabbath.<a name=5:4></a> The second is the title of grace to rise above them.<a name=5:5></a> For grace is of God.<a name=5:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next, we find the nomination of the apostles.<a name=5:7></a> After the Lord's personal position and character had been brought out, this finds a natural place.<a name=5:8></a> He selects His instruments.<a name=5:9></a> This still follows the same order as Mark; who, after a general statement of the position of Jesus, continues his account with the same event.<a name=5:10></a> Matthew has not this choice of the twelve.<a name=5:11></a> He continues his full account of Jesus' mission in the midst of Israel till He sends them out to continue it.<a name=5:12></a> In Luke we find again here the dependent character of the Son of man.<a name=5:13></a> He is all night in prayer before He chooses the twelve.<a name=5:14></a> Here comes in the sermon on the mountain in its place; and we have clear evidence of the intended omission by the Holy Ghost of this choice of the twelve in Matthew, for as a man he must have known it, for he was one of the twelve.<a name=5:15></a> We have seen Matthew bringing in the sermon on the mount much earlier, as the principles of the kingdom.<a name=5:16></a> In Luke 6: 17 it should not be "the plain," but "a level place" -- still on the mountain.<a name=5:17></a> Luke gives the substance of the sermon in its great moral principles.<a name=5:18></a> His power, note, was shewn in the multitude (verse 17-19).<a name=5:19></a> The Lord addresses Himself in Luke to His disciples, as being themselves in the place He speaks of, instead of stating the abstract principle.<a name=5:20></a> The woes too are added.<a name=5:21></a> It is an address to the heart and conscience of the person present.<a name=5:22></a> He weaves in too, as verses 39, 40, other general principles connected with the precepts He is giving.<a name=5:23></a> So verses 44, 45.<a name=5:24></a> Here we have left Mark, who does not give the sermon on the mount.<a name=5:25></a> He gives the choice of the apostles, and then passes on to the full blasphemy of the Pharisees, and Jesus' refusal to listen to His mother, preceding the parables from the ship, as in Matthew 12 and 13.<a name=5:26></a> But the order in Luke, in this particular case, helps us, as it does in Matthew, to identify the sermon on the mount in the two Gospels.<a name=5:27></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		From the mountain He enters into Capernaum, and heals the centurion's servant.<a name=6:1></a> Here Christ's divine title and power is shewn; but he does not use it to shew the rejection of Israel, and the reception of the Gentiles as in Matthew.<a name=6:2></a> The widow of Nain, again, shews the divine power and compassion of Jesus in the place of death and sorrow; this circumstance is peculiar to Luke.<a name=6:3></a> In Matthew 8 the leper, and the healing of Peter's wife's mother, are introduced respectively before and after the centurion's servant, without reference to the order of time.<a name=6:4></a> After this, the relative positions of John and Christ are brought forward; which is not in Mark, and is much later in Matthew.<a name=6:5></a> I apprehend its historical place is here.<a name=6:6></a> In Luke we have the moral effect of both inquired into.<a name=6:7></a> The people and publicans justified Christ, having humbled themselves under John's baptism; the Pharisees not, having refused to do so.<a name=6:8></a> Matthew introduces here Jesus thanking the Father for His way of dealing with the wise and with babes, and the real reason of the change taking place; taking it again, I apprehend, out of its historical order to complete the picture of that change furnished by John's position and message.<a name=6:9></a> This justifying of wisdom by her children is then illustrated by the woman who was a sinner, in contrast with Simon the Pharisee.<a name=6:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This deep-reaching moral picture is in Luke only, as are also the few words which follow (chapter 8); which cast so clear a light on the Lord's life; and give the double character of devotedness -- that of the apostles, and of the women who followed Him.<a name=6:11></a> One of the parables of Matthew 13 is then given, that is, the present service in the word, and responsibility of man, his duty to maintain the light.<a name=6:12></a> The case of Jesus' mother and brethren is then introduced in Luke, as shewing Christ's value for those who kept His word, and not as a witness of His breaking His ties with Israel in the flesh.<a name=6:13></a> None of the parables relative to the kingdom are spoken of.<a name=6:14></a> Here we return to the historical order which is in Mark until the feeding of the five thousand inclusive; that is, the history of Legion, Jairus' daughter, the sending out of the twelve, and the feeding of the multitude.<a name=6:15></a> As regards Legion, the difference is remarkable.<a name=6:16></a> In Matthew we have the display of Satan's power, as it would afterwards work in the Jews, and the request for Jesus' departure; not any detail as to the poor man that was healed.<a name=6:17></a> In Luke, as in Mark, we have the details of the effects on him: -- the Lord's real work in grace in the matter.<a name=6:18></a> In the case of Jairus and the woman with the issue of blood, the same brevity may be remarked in Matthew.<a name=6:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=7>[Page 7]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Luke all the moral circumstances are much more brought out in detail, as indeed in Mark also.<a name=7:1></a> What is shewn in Luke especially is grace, divine power acting in the kindness and goodness of a Man filled with charity.<a name=7:2></a> It is not, as in John, a divine person so much as a divine character; and that in the perfect sympathy of a Man.<a name=7:3></a> What shews this (as the case of the widow of Nain, Simon and the woman that was a sinner) is constantly found in Luke and not in the other Gospels.<a name=7:4></a> It is grace in and towards man.<a name=7:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On the other hand (chapter 9), the mission of the twelve, which comes in its place here, is given much more briefly, and with no special reference to Israel; nor the elaborate unfolding of the place which testimony would have among the people until Christ's return, which is found in Matthew.<a name=7:6></a> We have the fact: they are to preach the kingdom of God and heal the sick, and to go free from care and dependent on Himself.<a name=7:7></a> It is the same mission, but in its simple actual character.<a name=7:8></a> The effect on Herod is here introduced.<a name=7:9></a> Luke gives no account of John the Baptist's death.<a name=7:10></a> There is a short allusion to his imprisonment (Luke 3: 19), when John's preaching is spoken of; but this part of Israel's sin formed no part of his subject.<a name=7:11></a> Otherwise the same order as Mark's is still followed here.<a name=7:12></a> On the return of the twelve, the Lord goes into a desert place, is followed, and heals those who have need of healing.<a name=7:13></a> In these miracles, necessary to relate as great witnesses to Christ's power, Luke gives but the fact briefly, and, as so given, having more power in that respect.<a name=7:14></a> The connection of it with Israel, and His dismissal of the people, and taking Himself another position while His disciples were toiling alone, are all omitted.<a name=7:15></a> In Matthew and Mark, the closing circumstances of this miracle lead to a series of events and incidents.<a name=7:16></a> which refer all of them to Christ's special relationship with the Jews, the moral position of these, and God's estimate of them; all of which are omitted in Luke.<a name=7:17></a> Matthew 14: 22 to 16: 12; Mark 6: 47 to 8: 26.<a name=7:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=8>[Page 8]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All three Gospels then come to Peter's confession of Christ and the transfiguration.<a name=8:1></a> Only in Luke the common opinions as to Christ connect themselves more directly with Herod's, and what is there said.<a name=8:2></a> For Luke 9: 18 is directly connected with chapter 10, and that with what precedes.<a name=8:3></a> Still the transfiguration is a great central event in all, and that connected with the confession of Peter.<a name=8:4></a> In all the rejection of Christ and the taking up the cross are founded on Peter's owning Him to be the Christ, and precede the revelation of His glory.<a name=8:5></a> There are some differences to be noted.<a name=8:6></a> Matthew recounts Christ's instruction as to the church, which was to take the place for the present of His Messiah glory; and the place Peter was to hold in the administration of the kingdom.<a name=8:7></a> Here also in Luke the matter is simply stated in its own moral force; and the details of Peter's dislike to the cross, and the Lord's rebuke, are omitted.<a name=8:8></a> The character of what they are about to see is also more simply stated.<a name=8:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Matthew, for whom the change from Messiah to Son of man is a main point, and the future coming of Christ in this character (see Matthew 24: 30), the expression used in connection with this display of His glory is the Son of man coming in His kingdom.<a name=8:10></a> In Mark, where service in the word forms the subject, it is the kingdom of God come with power.<a name=8:11></a> In Luke it is simply till they see the kingdom of God.<a name=8:12></a> There is a difference also in the details.<a name=8:13></a> The moral circumstances again appear in Luke.<a name=8:14></a> The disciples are asleep.<a name=8:15></a> The Lord is speaking of His decease.<a name=8:16></a> It is the entry of Moses and Elias<a href="#8:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> into the cloud that alarmed them.<a name=8:17></a> All the ensuing conversation relative to John's being Elias, of which Matthew and Mark speak, is not found in Luke's account; but he returns after the casting out of a devil to the doctrine of the cross (verse 44, 45).<a name=8:18></a> And further, in the rest of this chapter, in Luke 9, we have all the forms which self takes, and which it would excuse and justify from the grossest to the most subtle; and the claim of Christ and the service of grace in the kingdom is shewn to be paramount to every thing.<a name=8:19></a> Two of the circumstances are given in Matthew and Mark; the second, that of the little child, as an example, with a large addition of instruction as to offences; and with the addition, in Matthew, of the position which the church takes, as in the place of Israel in respect of offences.<a name=8:20></a> This passes off in Matthew to other questions relative to the Jews.<a name=8:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#8:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>It rather appears that the second "they" refers to Moses and Elias, though it is not absolutely certain.

	<div class="paragraph">
		We then find in Luke a mission not noticed in the other Gospels, that of the seventy (chapter 10).<a name=9:1></a> It is in principle the same as that of the twelve, only more urgent, but there is no limit as in Matthew 10.<a name=9:2></a> Those that rejected them were to be equally sure that the kingdom of God had come nigh to them.<a name=9:3></a> Such was essentially the message, with proofs of the power of Him that sent it.<a name=9:4></a> From this onwards to the commencement of the closing scene (chapter 18: 31), what we read in Luke is either not in Matthew and Mark, or is here connected with other subjects than the historical ones found in those Gospels; and the various circumstances are introduced in their moral connection.<a name=9:5></a> On the return of the seventy the great moral connection of the gospel with eternal hopes comes out.<a name=9:6></a> The power of Christ's name over the demons brings to Christ's mind the final overthrow of Satan.<a name=9:7></a> Still the subject of joy for them was not that they could cast out devils, but that they belonged themselves to heaven -- their names were registered there.<a name=9:8></a> This gave a very clear and definite character to the Gospel.<a name=9:9></a> It is in this connection that the hiding these things from wise and prudent, and revealing them to babes, is introduced here; not in connection with the rejection of John Baptist and Christ, and the total change in God's dealings with man taking place, as in Matthew 11.<a name=9:10></a> Hence it is added here, that the Lord turned to the disciples to remark their blessedness, for these things were brought to their eyes.<a name=9:11></a> It is the blessing of the heavenly people which is before us.<a name=9:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What follows is in Luke alone.<a name=9:13></a> After the essence of the statement of the law, the Lord shews to him who would justify himself by a cavil on the terms, that grace, the new and blessed principle of God's dealings, makes us, by its own nature, the neighbour of every one that has need, and obliterates, by its divine nature, the divisions formed by ordinance which work no grace, but, with the heart such as it is, tend to nourish pride by distinguishing him to whom they belong.<a name=9:14></a> The bearing of this instruction, and its deep moral character, are evident.<a name=9:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=10>[Page 10]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next, we learn the value of hearing the word -- in contrast with cares -- and that of prayer, its character and success (chapter 11).<a name=10:1></a> We have then the final hardness of the Pharisee shewn, and the way in which Satan possesses the heart void of God, though it seem reformed; but without application to Israel's final state, as in Matthew.<a name=10:2></a> The Lord turns, on one speaking of the value of natural ties with Him, to the word; that God owned those who heard and kept it, as the only true tie -- the Ninevites and Queen of Sheba, as owning the word from feebler lips than He who was there, would condemn that generation.<a name=10:3></a> We have then the judgment of the moral state of the Pharisees, but not here connected with the final judgment of Jerusalem, and the connection of the disciples with Israel, as in Matthew.<a name=10:4></a> Still the Lord shews, that all the blood shed would be required of them, as in Matthew.<a name=10:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have then a general warning as to their principles, and those on which the disciples were to act, taken, partly from a private warning to His disciples, partly from His instruction to the twelve when He sent them out, partly from His statement as to the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost: but this is here employed to encourage the disciples in acting on the principles of the upright testimony He had spoken to them of; shewing that the Holy Ghost who was spoken against, spoke in them, and would tell them what to say; chapter 12.<a name=10:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As the Lord had urged on His disciples, faithfulness, uprightness, and boldness in testimony, so now He goes on to press on them disinterestedness and absence of all carefulness.<a name=10:7></a> This, however, is introduced by one who looked to Him to order things rightly on earth.<a name=10:8></a> This He entirely disclaims, and turns to the multitude to press on them the folly of having their portion here, which death in a moment could snatch away.<a name=10:9></a> With His disciples He presses another motive, namely, their preciousness in the Father's eyes.<a name=10:10></a> Here some of the instructions of the sermon on the mount come in.<a name=10:11></a>

		The history of the last events, begins, as we have seen in reading Matthew, with the entrance into Jericho, where the blind man owns Him as Son of David, and receives his sight.<a name=15:18></a> But here also the grace which receives the vile, in spite of Jewish prejudices, must be brought out in Luke; chapter 19.<a name=15:19></a> This is the more remarkable here, as connected with His character as Son of David, and His speedy entry into Jerusalem, according to Zechariah.<a name=15:20></a> Zacchaeus had been honestly faithful to his conscience; but that day salvation came to his house.<a name=15:21></a> His heart had been drawn; but now salvation came to him.<a name=15:22></a> The Son of David, Messiah the King, would, in spite of Pharisees, meet the wants of the poor and despised in Israel, however false their position.<a name=15:23></a> And that of Zacchaeus was so; and no attempt to satisfy the exigencies of his conscience changed its falseness; indeed this creates them But in a time of confusion (and who does not see such?<a name=15:24></a>) grace reaches through the forms this confusion takes in individuals, to meet the need which lies at the bottom of the heart, and which grace had produced, and which shews itself in many a detail of which grace takes notice, and which grace can see (though selfishness cannot), as the Lord did here.<a name=15:25></a> Such grace as Jesus' draws them out, as it did here; but that grace, at the same time, passes by as well all the efforts to quiet the conscience.<a name=15:26></a> It brings salvation.<a name=15:27></a> Zacchaeus was a son of Abraham, surely as much as the Pharisees.<a name=15:28></a> I am disposed to think, that the healing of the blind man is out of its place in Luke, and is introduced before the Lord's entry into Jericho, in order to give its true character to the reception of Zacchaeus.<a name=15:29></a><a href="#15:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#15:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>The expression employed, I judge, carefully avoids the moment or act of entering into Jericho. The Greek for "as he was come nigh unto Jericho," Luke 18: 35, is in a form always distinctively used for a period or course of action, a state of things during which a thing happens. It may refer to an individual act; but it is while a thing takes place not as it takes place, as a particular point. It is at the period in which Jesus came into the neighbourhood of Jericho, which He did in a particular manner; in fact, at that time.

		Besides the very interesting history of Zacchaeus, Luke adds the parable of the traffic with the <i>mina</i>, referring to the way in which the kingdom would be set up, and the Jews' rejection of Him.<a name=16:1></a> It is evident that there are certain points of analogy between this and the parable addressed to the disciples in Matthew; but there are important points of distinction.<a name=16:2></a> Here responsibility is much more distinctly brought out; God's sovereignty, though ever wise sovereignty, in gifts, less.<a name=16:3></a> In Matthew one had five talents; another two; another one, according to his several ability.<a name=16:4></a> Here each has one; all depends on the faithfulness of the servant.<a name=16:5></a> Hence, it is not, as in Matthew, one common joy, "Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord"; but "Be thou over ten, thou over five cities.<a name=16:6></a>" It is reward in the kingdom, not common joy with Christ; each being faithful in what was entrusted, and having gained according to what was given him.<a name=16:7></a> But another point is brought in, not merely the faithfulness of the servants, in which the analogy, though not sameness, of the two parables lies.<a name=16:8></a> The question of the Jews receiving the kingdom or not is treated; they could not, for they would not receive the King.<a name=16:9></a> Christ was now near that place where this question was to be decided, the city of the great King; and men thought the kingdom should immediately appear.<a name=16:10></a> He shews them that another order was to be followed.<a name=16:11></a> He was going to a far country, heaven, to receive the kingdom.<a name=16:12></a> Meanwhile, He left His servants to trade; not yet to be His partners in the glory of the kingdom -- that would come afterwards.<a name=16:13></a> They would have their place in it according to their faithfulness in His absence; to them that had, more would be given.<a name=16:14></a> But there was another class of persons, His citizens -- over whom He should have reigned -- the Jews; but they, in their rejection of the gospel after His departure, declared they would not have Him to reign over them.<a name=16:15></a> They are, on His return, brought before Him and slain.<a name=16:16></a> It was not merely the rejection of Christ; -- He interceded for them on the cross, for that as their ignorance, and the Spirit comes to tell them, He will return on their repentance; -- but their opposition to this last, as a message sent after Him, that they will not have Him.<a name=16:17></a> This gave the full instructions as to the course the introduction of the kingdom would take.<a name=16:18></a>

		Then follows the choice of the room for the Passover.<a name=20:16></a> Here there are some important circumstances peculiar to Luke.<a name=20:17></a> First, the Lord's love and feeling about it (verse 15); next, the reference to the eating the lamb for the last time, and the cup: besides the institution of the Supper, the presence of Judas, and the strife among them who should be the greatest.<a name=20:18></a> The manner of expression, too, is according to the character of that Gospel; that is, opening the then next present order of God's dealings, instead of going on dispensationally to the renewal of God's relationship with the world.<a name=20:19></a> The Passover was to be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.<a name=20:20></a> Hence He was glad to eat of it for the last time in His earthly association with His disciples.<a name=20:21></a> This is not in Matthew.<a name=20:22></a> It is the great moral fact of universal bearing of the death of Christ.<a name=20:23></a>

		Next, as to His drinking of the fruit of the vine.<a name=21:1></a> In Matthew, He takes His character of Nazarite separation from Israel, until He drinks it in a new way in the Father's kingdom: the time of future blessedness spoken of, in this way, in Matthew.<a name=21:2></a> Compare chapter 13.<a name=21:3></a> Here, He takes the Nazarite place as a present thing, but closes, so to speak, every thought of this association in the present time, fixing the mind on the present setting up of the kingdom.<a name=21:4></a> In Matthew in connection with His death, and the founding of the new covenant thereon, He goes quite on to the establishment of the Father's kingdom: only shewing His separation from all on earth, till that establishment of the kingdom came.<a name=21:5></a> The words of institution differ, also, somewhat.<a name=21:6></a> In Matthew, He replaces the passover: and the words, "this is my body," only are given.<a name=21:7></a> In Luke the gift of grace is noticed.<a name=21:8></a> In Matthew it is noticed as going out beyond the Jews, to whom Christ had presented Himself, as related in that Gospel -- shed for many, for the remission of sins.<a name=21:9></a> In Luke it is the simple, personal application of grace -- "for you.<a name=21:10></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The inquiry among the disciples who should betray Him, is found in Luke in a few words, as we have seen in other cases.<a name=21:11></a> On the other hand, an humbling moral circumstance is stated; that, even here, was a strife among them who should be greatest -- at such a moment!<a name=21:12></a> But it gives occasion to the perfect and patient grace of Christ, to teach them the true path of glory He had followed -- that of humility, and being servant to all; and to own, in unspeakable grace, as if dependent on their kindness, their perseverance with Him.<a name=21:13></a> Also He appointed to them a kingdom, as His Father had appointed to Him: so that they should be at table in His kingdom, and sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.<a name=21:14></a> The very greatness of the glory and the blessing ought to silence the dispute.<a name=21:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In Matthew the fact here revealed is given (Matthew 19: 16-30) in connection with setting aside human righteousness, and riches as an advantage and reward connected with it (that is, the setting aside the Jewish system); and with the glory, in the time of the regeneration, consequent on the loss of all for faith: still shewing, in chapter 20, that grace -- sovereign grace -- characterised God's dealing with men in the kingdom.<a name=21:16></a>

		To turn to Luke 22, where the general application of Christ's death to faith is spoken of, the result of the present faithfulness of the disciples in connection with Christ before His death would meet its judgment in Jewish millennial glory.<a name=22:1></a> But into His death -- which, while witnessing judgment of sin, was the means of salvation -- they could not follow Him; to be saved by it was another thing.<a name=22:2></a> Their service in His suffering in the kingdom would be recompensed with glory in the kingdom; but death, as such, man could not stand in, such as he was: that belonged to Christ only, a lesson they had not yet learned.<a name=22:3></a> They could not go into it as death from the divine judgment of sin; but they could as a sifting from the enemy, to learn that they could not, but must be dependent on Another's doing it.<a name=22:4></a> This is found only in Luke; and the ardour of nature is suffered to go farther in Peter, to teach the entire incapacity of the energy of nature to do the work of God (its ardour only making its fall more apparent and terrible); so that, by the experience of what it was worth, and grace meeting it, one should be better able to strengthen others with true strength.<a name=22:5></a> This done, the Lord shews the difference of their position during His life, and that induced by His death.<a name=22:6></a> He had served them as a living Saviour.<a name=22:7></a> They must suffer, and, humanly speaking, shift for themselves when He became a dying one.<a name=22:8></a> On the earth He was reckoned among malefactors; for the things which concerned Him drew to a close.<a name=22:9></a> New ones would begin.<a name=22:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This contrast of Christ's life, and His disciples' connection with it; and His death, and the impossibility of their being connected with Him in it, is peculiar to Luke.<a name=22:11></a> Into the latter, that is, the scenes connected with His death, he now enters.<a name=22:12></a> This point is important.<a name=22:13></a> The human character of the blessed Lord's suffering in Gethsemane is much more brought out in Luke; and circumstances of the deepest interest are added, while the details of the thrice repeated prayer are omitted, and all is brought together in its moral character.<a name=22:14></a> The chief circumstances added are these.<a name=22:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord already on arriving at the place, Himself perfect in the sense of what it was, warns them of their need and how to meet it.<a name=22:16></a> "Pray that ye enter not into temptation.<a name=22:17></a>" Further, an angel from heaven appeared to Him to strengthen Him.<a name=22:18></a> Here we find His human position clearly brought out.<a name=22:19></a> Again, we have the solemn sign of the conflict in which He was: His sweat as great drops of blood falling down.<a name=22:20></a> All this s brought together without distinguishing His three prayers.<a name=22:21></a> Save the answer of the Lord to Judas as to his kiss, nothing distinctive, that I am aware of, is in what follows, only the healing of Malchus is more briefly noticed.<a name=22:22></a> Conflict through prayer in view of temptation, not to enter into it, characterises Luke's account of Gethsemane, not the being sorrowful unto death.<a name=22:23></a> The forsaking of the disciples is not in Luke.<a name=22:24></a> The personal human conflict of Jesus is His subject.<a name=22:25></a> The trial of Peter follows in Luke.<a name=22:26></a> The Lord had closed His address to those that came, by saying that it was the hour of Satan's power -- alas!<a name=22:27></a> their hour also, but the time of the exercise of the power of darkness; happily for us, for the light has shone there, and in that light, the power of darkness is gone for us.<a name=22:28></a> This Gospel brings in, in connection with this, Peter's history under temptation and the power of the enemy, before pursuing that of Christ's interrogatory.<a name=22:29></a>

		There is no difficulty in the details, as has been imagined.<a name=23:1></a> The maid spoke to the men, a man to Peter.<a name=23:2></a> The perfect grace of the Lord is brought out here in a circumstance omitted elsewhere -- the Lord's looking at Peter.<a name=23:3></a> The personal sorrows of Christ are given as such in Luke.<a name=23:4></a> His being buffeted is given also before His interrogatory: and this last very briefly in the testimony of Christ Himself, who declares the uselessness of reply; that henceforth they would not see Him, but in glory.<a name=23:5></a> All the witness as to the destruction of the temple is omitted.<a name=23:6></a>

		The account of Luke is here also much more brief, but an important fact added (chapter 23).<a name=23:7></a> Judas' death is not found (see the Acts), nor the message of Pilate's wife, nor the Jews taking His blood upon their head, nor, subsequently, the crown of thorns and insults.<a name=23:8></a> On the other hand, the sending to Herod is brought before us, and thus the full uniting of all against the rightful Lord of the world -- the Christ -- is presented to us; with the solemn but too natural picture of the opposition to Christ, uniting those who in their personal interests and passions were otherwise enemies.<a name=23:9></a> They can compliment each other in treating Christ thus.<a name=23:10></a> Pilate, doubtless, would have quieted thus a disturbed conscience by throwing the matter over on Herod, or avoided the guilt.<a name=23:11></a> But thus it was to be.<a name=23:12></a> Nor can men thus escape the fruit of their own wickedness.<a name=23:13></a> He hoped to get rid of the matter.<a name=23:14></a> What is noticed in Luke is, that he delivered Jesus to their will.<a name=23:15></a>

		The circumstances attending Christ's crucifixion give a very different character to the scene, though the great central truth is necessarily the same.<a name=24:1></a> He is all through now, indeed, the green tree.<a name=24:2></a> It is the Man, the Man dependent on the Father, the holy confiding Man, as full of grace now as when walking through a world enlightened (had it been possible) by His miracles.<a name=24:3></a> His sufferings, His death as King of the Jews, are recounted surely, the veil of the temple is rent; but the accomplishing so many prophecies, and the expression of His expiatory agony, are not noticed.<a name=24:4></a> Nature wept at His sorrow, His loss, and the terrible act was felt; but it was over themselves these daughters of Jerusalem should weep.<a name=24:5></a> He was the green tree, and if this happened in Him, what should be done to the dry, the lifeless Jerusalem, whose sorrow He was bearing, whose state in judgment He had in grace stepped forward to take for the remnant, who would fain have seen Him received, and acknowledged the sad estate of Jerusalem?<a name=24:6></a> Still a nation's sin was there.<a name=24:7></a> Judgment was due, and He, the green tree, took it on Him.<a name=24:8></a> The remnant would thus escape, but the dry tree, what would be done in it?<a name=24:9></a> It is not simply salvation here, but judgment on the nation.<a name=24:10></a> Thus unfolds many Psalms, and the desire that the meek and righteous should not be ashamed for His sake.<a name=24:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verses 35-38 very briefly recount what the other two evangelists relate in detail; and then we have the deeply interesting account of the malefactor, which, as the weeping women drew out the judicial dealings with Jerusalem, and the place Christ took as to the judgment due to the people, unfolds the heavenly portion through faith in Jesus, in virtue of expiation and grace of one who leaves this earth, however great a sinner a man may be, be he who he may, before even the kingdom is set up at all.<a name=24:12></a> This we have constantly seen is in view in Luke, -- the eternal, moral, heavenly blessing, what we call Christianity, in contrast with the order of dispensations, while even owning these.<a name=24:13></a> Even the dispensational part (the weeping women) is treated morally.<a name=24:14></a> The poor thief, converted, justified, and cleansed, was to be that very day with Him in paradise.<a name=24:15></a> The traits of his conversion and faith are admirable.<a name=24:16></a> The circumstance that the sun, the centre of all natural light and life, and of the whole system of nature for us, was darkened is added (verse 45).<a name=24:17></a> Nature was put out, and its central sun darkened, as it were, but the way into the holiest laid open by the very same thing.<a name=24:18></a>

		But, on the other hand, there is no rising for the earthly witness (as in Matthew) of bodies of the saints.<a name=25:1></a> Further, there is not the agony of rejection from the light of God's countenance -- the opposite to all that every righteous man in Israel hitherto could say, for they had been heard.<a name=25:2></a> But we have the new man, the man that trusts in God.<a name=25:3></a> Having passed through it and drunk, in perfect obedience, the bitter cup, He can say, "Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit.<a name=25:4></a>" In death, He trusts His soul to His Father.<a name=25:5></a> So the centurion also here recognises the Lord in this character; "Certainly this was a righteous man.<a name=25:6></a>" Luke adds the moral effect on the people now, as so often happens under the effect of what their misguided passions had led to.<a name=25:7></a> That He was with the rich in His death is then related by all.<a name=25:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In what follows, as we have so often found, Luke relates in a general way, bringing all together, the discovery by the women and by Peter of the resurrection of Jesus; but there is no apparition of Jesus here to any of them; chapter 24.<a name=25:9></a> Angels spoke to the women -- they to the disciples.<a name=25:10></a> It was as idle tales to these; only Peter went to the sepulchre and found it was so, and departed wondering.<a name=25:11></a> But then Luke gives the details of the touching history of the journey to Emmaus, just noticed by Mark, where Jesus reveals Himself; and here it is by an allusion to His death, which, though in no way the Lord's supper, intimated a part of the same truth as that.<a name=25:12></a> The Christ they had to know was a Christ who had died, whose body had been broken for them, and who then disappeared -- was to be known by faith.<a name=25:13></a> At the same time He had expounded to them the Scriptures.<a name=25:14></a> This and indeed something more, is again found after His personal revelation of Himself to Simon, and to the eleven and others.<a name=25:15></a> We have His revelation of Himself first to Peter, and then the clear setting forth that He was really a risen man, having flesh and bones, and having even eaten with them.<a name=25:16></a> Two things then are presented, divinely given intelligence of Scripture, and power given from on high.<a name=25:17></a>

		NOTES ON THE GOSPEL OF LUKE
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		CHAPTER 1
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Saviour is presented to us in Luke in His character as Son of man, displaying the power of Jehovah in grace in the midst of men.<a name=37:1></a> At first, doubtless, we find Him in relationship with Israel, to whom He had been promised; but afterwards moral principles are brought out, which apply to man, as such, wherever he might be.<a name=37:2></a> And indeed what characterises Luke's account of our Lord, and gives special interest to his Gospel, is that it presents to us Christ Himself, and not His official glory as in Matthew, nor His mission or service as in Mark, nor the peculiar revelation of His divine nature as in John.<a name=37:3></a> It is Himself, such as He was, a man upon the earth, moving among men day by day.<a name=37:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verses 1-4.<a name=37:5></a> Many had undertaken to give an account of what was historically received amongst Christians, as it had been related to them by the eye-witnesses.<a name=37:6></a> However well intended this might be, yet it was a work undertaken and executed by men.<a name=37:7></a> Luke had an exact and intimate knowledge of all from the beginning, and he found it good to write in order to Theophilus, that he might know the certainty of the things he had been instructed in.<a name=37:8></a> It is thus that God has provided for the whole church by the teaching contained in the living picture of Jesus that we owe to this man of God.<a name=37:9></a> For Luke, although he might be personally moved by Christian motives, was of course none the less inspired by the Holy Ghost to write.<a name=37:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verses 5-17.<a name=37:11></a> The history brings us into the midst of Jewish institutions, feelings, and expectations.<a name=37:12></a> First, we have a priest of Abia (one of the twenty-four classes: 1 Chronicles 24), with his wife who was of the daughters of Aaron.<a name=37:13></a> "They were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.<a name=37:14></a>" All with them was in accordance with God's law Jewishly; but they did not enjoy the blessing so earnestly desired by every Jew; they were childless.<a name=37:15></a> Yet it was according to the ways of God to accomplish His work of blessing while manifesting the weakness of the instrument which He was using.<a name=37:16></a> But now this long-prayed-for blessing was to be withheld no longer; and when Zacharias draws near to offer the incense, the angel of Jehovah appears to him.<a name=37:17></a> At the sight of so glorious a being Zacharias is troubled; but the angel says to him, "Fear not, thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John," that is, "the favour of Jehovah.<a name=37:18></a>" And not only should the hearts of many rejoice in him, but he should be great in the sight of the Lord and be filled with the Holy Ghost.<a name=37:19></a> "Many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.<a name=37:20></a> And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias .<a name=37:21></a>.<a name=37:22></a>.<a name=37:23></a> to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.<a name=37:24></a>" The "spirit of Elias" was a firm and ardent zeal for the glory of Jehovah and for the re-establishment, through repentance, of Israel's relations with Him.<a name=37:25></a> The heart of John clung to this link of the people with God, and it is in the moral force of his call to repentance that John is here compared to Elias.<a name=37:26></a>

		Verses 18-23.<a name=38:1></a> But Zacharias's faith, as is alas!<a name=38:2></a> so often the case, was not equal to the greatness of his request.<a name=38:3></a> He knows not how to walk in the steps of Abraham, and he asks again how such a thing can be.<a name=38:4></a> God's goodness turns the unbelief of His servant into a chastening that was profitable for him, and that served, at the same time, as a proof to the people that he had been visited from on high.<a name=38:5></a> Zacharias remains dumb until the word of Jehovah is accomplished.<a name=38:6></a>

		Verses 24, 25.<a name=38:7></a> Elizabeth, with feelings so suitable to a holy woman, remembering what had been a shame to her in Israel (the traces of which were only made the more marked by the supernatural blessing now granted to her), hides herself, whilst at the same time she owns the Lord's goodness to her.<a name=38:8></a> But what may conceal us from the eyes of men has great value before God.<a name=38:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verses 26-38.<a name=38:10></a> And now the scene changes, in order to introduce the Lord Himself into this marvellous scene that is unfolding itself before our eyes.<a name=38:11></a> In Nazareth, that despised place, there was found a young virgin, unknown by the world, whose name was Mary.<a name=38:12></a> She was espoused to Joseph, who was of the house of David; but so out of order was everything in Israel, that this descendant of the king was a carpenter.<a name=38:13></a> But what is this to God?<a name=38:14></a> Mary was a chosen vessel; she had found favour in the eyes of God.<a name=38:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We must remark that the subject here is the birth of the child Jesus as born of Mary.<a name=38:16></a> It is not so much His divine nature as the Word which was God and which was made flesh (though, of course, it is the same precious Saviour presented here as in John's Gospel); but it is Jesus as really and truly man -- born of a virgin.<a name=38:17></a> His name was to be Jesus, that is, Jehovah the Saviour.<a name=38:18></a> "He shall be called the Son of the highest, and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David" -- still looking at Him as man born into the world.<a name=38:19></a> But He was God as well as man.<a name=38:20></a> Holy by His birth, conceived by the power of God, this blessed One, who even as born of Mary is spoken of as "that holy thing," was to be called "the Son of God.<a name=38:21></a>"

		<a class="footnote" name="#47:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>Observe, that Matthew only uses the expression, "kingdom of heaven." It is often, in a general sense, capable of being interchanged with "kingdom of God," as we see by comparing Luke. Notwithstanding, the two phrases cannot always replace each other, and Matthew uses "kingdom of God" in a few passages where "kingdom of heaven" could not be used (Matthew 6: 33; 12: 28; 21: 43). Thus "the kingdom of God" was there when Christ the King was there; "the kingdom of heaven" began with Christ going to heaven. By-and-by, when Satan ceases to rule, it will be the "kingdom of heaven" (and "of God" too, of course), not in a mystery, but in manifestation. "The kingdom of God" has also a moral force which "kingdom of heaven" has not; and in this way it is frequently used by Paul, and was peculiarly suitable to the Spirit's design in Luke.

		We saw the Lord taking His place of servant with the excellent in Israel, and thereon the heavens opened, and Himself owned by the Father as His beloved Son.<a name=51:10></a> His delights were with the sons of men, and He is traced up, not to Abraham only, the root and depositary of Jewish promises, but to Adam and God Himself.<a name=51:11></a> Independently of His proper divine glory as Son of the Father, Jesus should be called the Son of the Highest, the Son of God.<a name=51:12></a> As man on earth, He was sealed with the Holy Ghost.<a name=51:13></a> He took upon Him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men.<a name=51:14></a> His entire perfectness now was to fulfil, as a servant, the will of Him who sent Him; for a servant doing his own will is a bad servant.<a name=51:15></a> Dependence, waiting, and obedience, were the characteristics of this place, and they are found in Him to the uttermost.<a name=51:16></a> Hence, as in the Psalms, "I waited patiently for the Lord.<a name=51:17></a>" He would not ask for power, but waits on God.<a name=51:18></a> "Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?<a name=51:19></a>" Put thoroughly to the test, He would do nothing but His Father's will.<a name=51:20></a> He was to learn obedience.<a name=51:21></a> Having taken the place, He would go through it wholly, not in one act, but experiencing the force of that expression, learning obedience, without one comfort here, with enemies around, bulls of Bashan besetting, dogs compassing.<a name=51:22></a> He had to learn obedience where obedience was always suffering, even to the yielding up of life.<a name=51:23></a> Every single step was humiliation till the close came in the cross, where the wrath of God was borne in love to us.<a name=51:24></a> No doubt He found, in His rejection, fields white for harvest, and so shall we, in our measure, when walking in the same path.<a name=51:25></a> But the cross was always before Him, -- everything that could stop a man.<a name=51:26></a> Nevertheless He went on, patiently waiting, and not asking for deliverances.<a name=51:27></a> Thus He presented perfect God to man, and perfect man to God.<a name=51:28></a>

		In accordance with this, we have now (verse 1-10) the case of the centurion, and a very full and striking one it is.<a name=73:2></a> It is not merely an act of grace, but grace to a Gentile.<a name=73:3></a> Nor is this all.<a name=73:4></a> The principle on which the apostle rests this question is brought out.<a name=73:5></a> "It is of faith, that it might be by grace, that the promise might be sure to all the seed.<a name=73:6></a>" Faith, as the great turning-point, is introduced.<a name=73:7></a> It was no mere theory; it was living faith, and such faith as had not been seen in Israel.<a name=73:8></a> Neither was there presumption, but, on the contrary, remarkable humility.<a name=73:9></a> He recognised the honour God had put upon His people; he sees, holds to it, owns and acts upon it, spite of their low and debased, and, in every other respect, unworthy condition.<a name=73:10></a> Despised and failing as they might be, he loved the Jews as God's people, and for His sake, and he had built them a synagogue.<a name=73:11></a> Unfeigned lowliness was his, though (yea, rather, for) his faith was far beyond those he honoured.<a name=73:12></a> Consequently he had a very high apprehension of the power and glory of the person of Christ as divine, reaching out beyond Jewish thoughts altogether.<a name=73:13></a> He does not refer to the Lord as Messiah, but recognised in Him the power of God in love.<a name=73:14></a> This was blessed faith, which forgets itself in the exaltation of its object.<a name=73:15></a> He had not seen Jesus, it would seem, but assuredly gathered from what he "heard," that diseases were nothing to Him but occasions wherein to display His absolute authority and His sovereign mercy.<a name=73:16></a> He was a stranger, and the Jews were God's people; must not they or their elders be the fittest to bring this wonderful person?<a name=73:17></a> For he confided in His mercy as well as His power, and his servant, "dear unto him," was sick and ready to die.<a name=73:18></a> He needed Jesus.<a name=73:19></a>

		Along with grace to the Gentiles came the evidence of power to raise the dead, but here it was manifested in human sympathies, in witness that God had visited His people (verse 11-17).<a name=74:12></a> It was the power of resurrection, a power which was yet to be shewn more gloriously, and to be the source of that which is new for man according to God -- the God who raiseth the dead.<a name=74:13></a> It was another and wondrous proof that He is here going, in the character of His action, without the sphere of the law and its ordinances.<a name=74:14></a> "For the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth": what can it avail for one who is dead?<a name=74:15></a> "But what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh," Romans 8: 3.<a name=74:16></a> It was grace, indeed, and divine energy, but withal displayed in One who was touched with the feeling of our infirmities.<a name=74:17></a> And how astonishingly all the details bring this out!<a name=74:18></a> The dead man was "the only son of his mother, and she was a widow.<a name=74:19></a>" "And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not .<a name=74:20></a>.<a name=74:21></a>.<a name=74:22></a> .<a name=74:23></a> And he that was dead sat up and began to speak.<a name=74:24></a> And he delivered him to his mother.<a name=74:25></a>" How exquisitely human, and withal how unmistakably divine!<a name=74:26></a>

		It is manifest that these two cases illustrate the change which the Spirit is attesting in this part of Luke.<a name=75:1></a> Nor is it otherwise with the scene that follows, which brings out in fact the hinge of the dispensation.<a name=75:2></a> The Lord bears witness to John Baptist, not John to the Lord.<a name=75:3></a> John sends two of his disciples, on the report of the Lord's miracles, to learn from Himself who He is.<a name=75:4></a> Are we surprised?<a name=75:5></a> He had preached and baptized in the confession of sins and in faith of the coming Messiah.<a name=75:6></a> But now all was changed.<a name=75:7></a> John was in prison, not delivered, and it was no longer a people preparing for the Lord.<a name=75:8></a> Was it not strange?<a name=75:9></a> At any rate John sought a plain answer, and well could he trust the word of One who did such mighty and holy works.<a name=75:10></a> But what a comment upon the marvellous change was this very inquiry!<a name=75:11></a> It was a sort of turning over the disciples of John to the Lord.<a name=75:12></a> "And in the same hour he cured many of their infirmities, and plagues, and evil spirits; and unto many that were blind he gave sight.<a name=75:13></a> Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way and tell John," etc.<a name=75:14></a> At the same time, if He receives no longer testimony from John, He bears it to him, owning John and his work.<a name=75:15></a> But they were owned from a higher ground where the Lord in grace and resurrection power had placed Himself; and this was based on entire rejection in and by the world, so that, though He was doing all good, still it was "blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me.<a name=75:16></a>" Hence in the very verse where the Lord recognises in the fullest way John the Baptist, He marks the change about to take place -- "he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.<a name=75:17></a>" Happy they who justified God in being baptized of John -- wretched the self-righteous who rejected His counsel against themselves.<a name=75:18></a> Wisdom is justified of all her children.<a name=75:19></a> They understand the ways of God, whether in the servant or the Lord.<a name=75:20></a> The ways are quite different, but understood in grace.<a name=75:21></a> This generation alas!<a name=75:22></a> understands none, finds fault with all.<a name=75:23></a> John is too righteous for them, Jesus is too gracious.<a name=75:24></a> The mourning of the one and the piping of the other are utterly distasteful.<a name=75:25></a> Such is man's wisdom before the ways of God.<a name=75:26></a> But the children of wisdom justify wisdom notwithstanding.<a name=75:27></a>

		And in spite of the perverseness of men, our Lord did not stop manifesting Himself to the world.<a name=76:1></a> Accordingly a tale follows (verse 36-50) which shews how God's wisdom is justified by and in those who own it in Jesus.<a name=76:2></a> It is a tale of grace,.<a name=76:3></a> of pure, plenary, pardoning grace, which rests not till its object is dismissed in perfect peace.<a name=76:4></a> Jesus is in the Pharisee's house, who failed entirely in the essential point: Simon perceived not the glory of Christ.<a name=76:5></a> In this the Lord meets him, and shews, in contrast with the woman "which was a sinner," the point where this Pharisee was exercising judgment to be precisely that wherein he failed.<a name=76:6></a> God's thoughts are not as our thoughts, nor His ways as our ways.<a name=76:7></a> What if the despised Jesus were not a prophet only, but a Saviour of poor lost sinners?<a name=76:8></a> Ah, God was unknown -- that was the secret.<a name=76:9></a> The converted soul sees the glory of the Lord as grace towards itself; he who is unconvinced, however interested humanly, judges according to his own thoughts, and therefore necessarily fails to see the glory which is not according to these thoughts.<a name=76:10></a> Man's judgment of the gospel must be wrong therefore; his reception of it, as grace, is alone right, and alone the way of coming to the knowledge of it.<a name=76:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This was, then, a direct and distinct example of God's ways.<a name=76:12></a> It was a forgiving of sins in grace, sovereignly and freely, to any poor sinner, manifesting and producing love in the forgiven, who loves God, because God is love, and this in respect of his sins, in Jesus the Lord.<a name=76:13></a> It was proper grace -- the ground on which any one, a Gentile or not, would be received, and God manifested not in requirement from man (and so making man in the flesh of importance) but making God all, and His character in sovereign grace, so bringing in blessing and its blessed effect upon the heart, developing the fruits of grace in a heart restored to confidence in God by the sense of His goodness.<a name=76:14></a>

		What a blessed picture!<a name=76:15></a> Goodness known not only in the act, but in Him who did it.<a name=76:16></a> The discernment of guilt in its gross forms by man was one thing, but the grace of God which could blot out and forgive all was quite another.<a name=76:17></a> It was not Christ there to judge, and to sanction Pharisees, but love to a sinner, manifesting God in this new character of grace, producing thankful holy love to God, and a blessed relationship, sovereign and beyond the reach of man.<a name=76:18></a> But how has God always to prove Himself right in His goodness to man!<a name=76:19></a> so hard is man's heart.<a name=76:20></a> But the Lord identifies Himself with the believer, and vindicates him against the haughty world, and this gives assurance.<a name=76:21></a> Perfectly regardless of comments, He applies Himself, not to unbelief, which were useless, but to those who have faith, and having communicated forgiveness, shews the soul his uprightness, that is, the right thoughts of God and self which faith has.<a name=76:22></a> The last word settles the whole question.<a name=76:23></a> The soul's love was a ground of evidence and reasoning -- not, of course, the cause.<a name=76:24></a> "Thy faith hath saved thee, said the Lord to the woman, Go in peace.<a name=76:25></a>" All is discharged from the conscience, and the heart finds itself infinitely and everlastingly a debtor to the continual fountain of all grace.<a name=76:26></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have seen, in what has preceded, the Lord presenting Himself, by His words and His work, as a new centre, to which and round which His people were gathered.<a name=77:1></a> Before this, Jehovah had been the centre, when Israel was the gathering point; for Jehovah was among the Jews, and the temple the place where He met with the people.<a name=77:2></a> But now the Son is here, "God manifest in the flesh," and He must be the centre of everything.<a name=77:3></a> But Israel would not be gathered, as the Lord Himself said in Matthew 23: 37, "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, .<a name=77:4></a>.<a name=77:5></a>.<a name=77:6></a> but ye would not.<a name=77:7></a>" Again in Isaiah 65: 2, "I have spread out my hands all the day to a rebellious people.<a name=77:8></a>"

		Israel could not have the blessing, for the flesh could not hold it.<a name=77:9></a> The flesh, simply looked at as such, is "as grass" (Isaiah 40).<a name=77:10></a> "All flesh is grass.<a name=77:11></a>" We have these two great principles running through the latter chapters of Isaiah; first that flesh, as flesh, could not hold the blessing, and be the depository for the promises.<a name=77:12></a> For when all grace came, in the person of the Lord, the people to whom He was sent He found withered down like grass.<a name=77:13></a> "Surely the people is grass: the grass withereth, the flower fadeth, but the word of our God shall stand for ever.<a name=77:14></a>" But God was not going to give up His purpose.<a name=77:15></a> Therefore in chapter 49 we find Jehovah says unto Christ, "Thou art my servant, O Israel, in whom I will be glorified.<a name=77:16></a>" Then Christ says, If God is to be glorified in Israel, "I have laboured in vain, and spent my strength for nought, and in vain, yet surely my judgment is with Jehovah, and my reward with my God.<a name=77:17></a>" Then saith Jehovah, "Though Israel be not gathered, yet shall I be glorified in the eyes of Jehovah.<a name=77:18></a> I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation to the ends of the earth.<a name=77:19></a>"

		This is what Christ is becoming in Luke's Gospel -- "a light to lighten the Gentiles," etc.<a name=78:1></a> And afterwards we find Paul quoting, with the perfect accuracy of the Spirit, this very scripture, so exactly fitted for them, to the Jews at Antioch.<a name=78:2></a> "It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken unto you, but seeing ye judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, lo!<a name=78:3></a> we turn to the Gentiles," etc.<a name=78:4></a> (Acts 13: 46, 47: and again, Acts 28: 28).<a name=78:5></a> Israel will be gathered afterwards, for Christ will hereafter raise up the tribes of Jacob and restore the preserved of Israel; but before this He turns to the Gentiles.<a name=78:6></a> All this the Lord pictures to us in Luke.<a name=78:7></a> In chapter 7 we see Israel refused both John the Baptist and Christ; but "wisdom is justified of her children.<a name=78:8></a>" The Pharisees and lawyers did not justify God at all, for they saw no beauty in Jesus, whereas the publicans did; and thus the poor woman, "who was a sinner," whose heart was touched by the grace of God, is the true child of wisdom, and is brought in here as an illustration of Christ being the new centre of blessing, "though Israel be not gathered.<a name=78:9></a>"

		The Lord then goes on with His testimony, gathering by the word, first, by parables, as in chapter 8, and then in chapter 9 sending forth His disciples to preach, with this commission, to shake off the dust from their feet, if they are not received, a token of the last testimony being rendered, when they are given up.<a name=78:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Here are two classes of persons gathered round Christ.<a name=78:11></a> First, the twelve apostles were public witnesses, fitted by divine grace to be the vessels of testimony, manifesting the electing power of God in calling them, and sending them forth in all the energy of ministry; Christ's apostles, sent out by Himself -- "As my Father hath sent me, even so send I you" -- His chosen ones.<a name=78:12></a> "Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you," etc.<a name=78:13></a> Then, secondly, there were others who were gathered by affection round Him, having no place of office in the church, but those whose hearts were touched and drawn round Him, not sent out like the first class, but not less devoted in heart than the apostles, for they followed Him and ministered to Him of their substance.<a name=78:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In verses 4-8 we have the parable of the sower; and here, as previously remarked, it is not the kingdom brought out as in Matthew, but the testimony as to what and whom Christ was gathering, and not as to the form the kingdom would take afterwards.<a name=79:1></a> The very fact of Christ coming as the sower proved that Israel was set aside; for had it been now to Israel as His vineyard, He must have come seeking fruit from the vine He had long before planted.<a name=79:2></a> He had come to Israel previously, seeking fruit and finding none.<a name=79:3></a> He now comes in the new character of the sower, which is quite another thing.<a name=79:4></a> He comes into a waste world, where there was nothing, and He begins a fresh work.<a name=79:5></a> God is not now looking for fruit from man in one sense, because man has been proved to be a bad tree: and the more you dig about and dung a bad tree, the more bad fruit it produces.<a name=79:6></a> "A tree is known by its fruits.<a name=79:7></a>" Christ came to seek and to save that which was lost.<a name=79:8></a> God is now going to produce the fruit He requires.<a name=79:9></a> He is not now looking for man to produce anything, for John the Baptist said, "Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.<a name=79:10></a>" Therefore the Lord now comes as sower?<a name=79:11></a> not looking for fruit, but doing that which will produce it.<a name=79:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He then goes on to describe the character and effect of the sowing, and the disciples ask the meaning of the parable (verse 9-15).<a name=79:13></a> Israel, as such, had forfeited its place, and therefore was "a people of no understanding" (Isaiah 27: 11).<a name=79:14></a> Long patience had waited on Israel.<a name=79:15></a> Seven hundred years had passed since the word was given to Isaiah, "Go tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not.<a name=79:16></a>" As individuals they might be drawn round the person of the Lord, but as a nation they were blinded.<a name=79:17></a> The disciples had an explanation of the parable, but as a nation the Lord speaks to them in parables (see verse 10), thus fulfilling to the nation the very words spoken by the prophet so long before.<a name=79:18></a> Now the testimony is closed as to Israel, though not as to God's final purpose respecting them.<a name=79:19></a>

		The seed is sown indiscriminately, and although man rejects it, because his will is opposed, nevertheless it is sown in his heart; for this parable shews how the word of God is perfectly adapted to the need of man, meeting his conscience and heart.<a name=80:1></a> "Never man spake like this man.<a name=80:2></a>" Christ's word came with a power that reached the heart and affections; the will is corrupt and therefore resists it.<a name=80:3></a> It is not abstract grace here, but the condition of man that is recognised; therefore we find the word so perfectly suited to the need, not claiming righteousness from man, but coming in with power to shew him that he is a sinner, and laying open the thoughts and intents of the heart.<a name=80:4></a> When the heart is thus detected, the word comes, with all gentleness and comfort, for healing and rest, because there is grace to meet a soul in whatever state it may be found.<a name=80:5></a> The heart is spoken to, and therefore the gospel leaves man without excuse.<a name=80:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Some too received the word with joy (verse 13).<a name=80:7></a> This was a proof that the conscience was untouched; for when that is reached it is anything but joy, until forgiveness is known.<a name=80:8></a> The feelings may be moved for a time, and the word be listened to with a joy which will give place to sorrow.<a name=80:9></a> The reason truth is thus flippantly taken up with joy is because there is no root, and so it is received in joy, and given up in trouble.<a name=80:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another class is where thorns spring up and choke the word.<a name=80:11></a> The understanding may be convinced and receive the truth; but the cares, pleasures, and riches of this world come in and choke the word.<a name=80:12></a> Now these "cares" are most subtle things, because they enter as necessary duties, and there is no sin in doing one's duty.<a name=80:13></a> Nay, it is right that a man should do his duty in his daily calling.<a name=80:14></a> But if these duties choke the word, and a man loses his soul through it, what then?<a name=80:15></a> The natural tendency of the heart often needs to be met with that word, "Take heed and beware of covetousness" (chapter 12).<a name=80:16></a> It is the love of possession.<a name=80:17></a> One came to the Lord, saying, "Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me.<a name=80:18></a>" The heart wanted to keep it.<a name=80:19></a> If love of the world or covetousness gets in amongst the saints, it is an insidious thing and most difficult to meet, because it is often not open to discipline; and yet, if covetousness slips into the heart, it checks the power of Christ over the soul and conscience, and eats out the practical life of the Christian, and his soul is withered, withered, withered.<a name=80:20></a> It may be checked by the -- power of God coming in; but this covetous care about earthy things is so subtle that, while there is nothing on which to lay the hand, the practical power of Christian life in the soul is gone, though of course, I need hardly say, eternal life can never be lost in those who once had it.<a name=80:21></a>

		"That on the good ground are they which, in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.<a name=81:1></a>" They may seem to the world to be fruits bright and blessed, but if people have not got Christ they tire.<a name=81:2></a> There will be no enduring, unless Christ has possession of the soul; but if He has, there will be an abiding motive, and people will go on, and "bring forth fruit with patience.<a name=81:3></a>" They that hear and keep it go steadily on, having their motive for action in the Lord.<a name=81:4></a> Trouble may come in, in the church; disappointment may arise, even from brethren; but they go on just the same, because they have got Christ before them: for the word they have heard and keep connects them with Christ, and He is more than anything else.<a name=81:5></a>

		This is a question, not of eternal salvation, but of the practical effect of the word as seen in this world (verse 16-18) -- the growth of the word in the soul, and that will not be hidden under a bushel.<a name=81:6></a> "Ye are the light of the world" and "the salt of the earth.<a name=81:7></a>" In those who only appear to be Christians it soon comes to nothing.<a name=81:8></a> "Whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that which he seemeth to have.<a name=81:9></a>" But those in whom the word works effectually are to be as a "candle" set on a candlestick.<a name=81:10></a> Israel being set aside for a season, God sets up a new light in the world; a light lit up by God because of the world's darkness.<a name=81:11></a> When Christ was here He was the light of the world, because of its darkness, and now we should be a light in the world, as we are "light in the Lord.<a name=81:12></a>" The light is here set up by Christ's word, and people are responsible for the word received.<a name=81:13></a> Suppose you have heard the word and bring forth no fruit, it will all come out, by-and-by, that you have heard the word and lost it, and the spiritual power accompanying it.<a name=81:14></a> For, even if you are saints, all that you have heard without fruit or power resulting there from, it will come out; for nothing is hid that shall not be known or come abroad.<a name=81:15></a> "Take heed how ye hear.<a name=81:16></a>"

		Christ is looking for the results of His sowing.<a name=82:1></a> There must be not only the hearing, but the possessing, and in this rests the responsibility; for if you keep the word which you have heard, more shall be given you.<a name=82:2></a> If, on hearing, I possess that which I hear, not merely have joy in receiving it, but possess it as my own, then it becomes a part of the substance of my soul, and I shall get more; for when the truth has become a substance in my soul, there is a capacity for receiving more.<a name=82:3></a> Suppose, for example, you hear the truth of the Lord's second coming and see your portion in the bride of Christ, and you do not lay hold of it practically, so as to possess it (have communion with God about it, which is possession); you will presently lose the expectation of His coming and forget your place of separation from the world, and the truth will gradually slip away, because you are not holding it in your soul before God.<a name=82:4></a> Consequently your soul becomes dead and dull, and you lose the very truth you have received.<a name=82:5></a>

		Thus, if one lives daily as waiting for the Lord from heaven, there will be no planning for the future, no laying up for the morrow; such a man will learn more and more, as other truths will open round this one grand central one, and he will be kept in the truth.<a name=82:6></a> If, on the other hand, he drops this centre truth by saying, "He cannot come yet; so many things must happen first," then is the progress of such an one's communion with God hindered, for, as we have said, it is according to what a man has heard and holds with God that there can be any growth; for what is the use of teaching me that the Lord may come to-morrow, if I am going on living as though He were not coming for a hundred years?<a name=82:7></a> Or where is the comfort and blessedness of the truth to my soul, if I am saying in my heart, "My Lord delayeth his coming?<a name=82:8></a>" Though I cannot lose my eternal life, yet if I am losing the truth and light I have had, I shall be merely floating on in the current of life, half world and half Christ, and all power of Christian life will be dimmed in my soul.<a name=82:9></a> If the truth is held in communion with God, it separates to Himself.<a name=82:10></a> Truth is to produce fruit, and you have no truth that does not bear fruit.<a name=82:11></a> Truth must build up the soul.<a name=82:12></a> "Sanctify them through thy truth; thy word is truth.<a name=82:13></a>" Christ becomes precious in and by the truth that I learn; and if it has not that power, it all drops out, comes to nothing, and is taken away.<a name=82:14></a> If Christ is precious to me, I shall be waiting for Him with affection, and if it is not so, the bare truth will soon be given up.<a name=82:15></a>

		"There talked two men with him, Moses and Elias.<a name=92:14></a>" This we may look at in two ways; dispensationally, as representing the law and the prophets; and in this way Moses held a very peculiar place, for it was through Him the law was given; Elijah had nearly as important a place also, for though the Jews were in a right position, they had failed in it, and he goes back to Horeb.<a name=92:15></a> The other prophets were never called to work miracles.<a name=92:16></a> Except the account of the dial of Ahaz, we hear of no miracle in Isaiah, Jeremiah, Hosea, Habakkuk, etc.<a name=92:17></a> Those prophets, sent of God, gave proof that He was caring for Israel; but there was nothing like the calling back in Elijah, who stood as the maintainer of the law, when the people had departed from it most grossly, though all the prophets, even to Malachi, called back to law.<a name=92:18></a>

		The point of this parable is seen in verses 8-11: it refers the heart to the Master, to "him that bade thee.<a name=134:1></a>" If I am conscious of being a sinner, and therefore deserving no place, I shall take none, but wait till God bestows one on me.<a name=134:2></a> I shall have honour indeed, when God gives me a place.<a name=134:3></a> The point is, What does He bestow upon me?<a name=134:4></a> Having the eye upon God, and referring to Him, seek for the lowest place as Christ did.<a name=134:5></a> It will not do to say, I will not have a place in the world; the great thing is, the heart resting on God's place in the world.<a name=134:6></a> When the eye is thus upon God, self is forgotten; if not, I am thinking of the slights I receive, and neither faith nor grace are in exercise.<a name=134:7></a> If I could think nothing of myself, I should be perfect.<a name=134:8></a> The man who bade the guests has the right estimate of each and the honour due to them.<a name=134:9></a> The evangelist's place, the pastor's, the apostle's, etc.<a name=134:10></a>, will all be appointed by God.<a name=134:11></a> When God gives me a place, it is one of power and nighness to Himself; but when a man takes a place for himself, it is one of weakness and alienation from God, because self is the object.<a name=134:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		At the close of chapter 20 and the beginning of chapter 21 we have a most instructive, though painful, contrast between the selfish hypocrisy of the scribes, whom He condemns before the people, and the real devoted love of the widow, whom He singles out for honour.<a name=168:1></a> Remark also that the Lord knows how to separate the intention of a sincere soul from the system that surrounds it, judging the whole state of that with which the individual is associated.<a name=168:2></a> Observe, further, the difference of giving one's living and one's superfluity.<a name=168:3></a> It is easy to compliment God with presents, and thus really minister to self; but she who gives her living gives herself in devotedness to God, and proves her dependence on God.<a name=168:4></a> Thus, the two mites of her who had these only expressed all this perfectly: for there was need and everything else to hinder, while the applause of men and the pride of the donor found no place here.<a name=168:5></a> For Jewish splendour the act had little worth; but the Lord saw, and bore witness of, the poor widow, blessed in her deed.<a name=168:6></a>

		Verses 5 and following.<a name=168:7></a> The account which the Lord gives in this Gospel of the sorrows of Jerusalem is also, like the preceding, much more allied to the simple fact of the judgment on the nation and the change of dispensation.<a name=168:8></a> It differs much from Matthew 24, which fully refers to what is to arrive at the end; while our Gospel bears, more than the first two, on the then present time and setting aside of Jerusalem.<a name=168:9></a> Hence, Luke plainly sets forth the siege and destruction by Titus, and the times of the Gentiles.<a name=168:10></a> Let it be observed also that the question in verse 7 extends only to the predicted destruction.<a name=168:11></a> Consequently, in what follows, we have the judgment on the nation taken as a whole, from its then destruction till the times of the Gentiles (with whose economy this Gospel is so much occupied) be fulfilled.<a name=168:12></a> Nation should rise against nation, signs from heaven and sorrows on earth follow.<a name=168:13></a> And before all these the disciples would be objects of hostility, but this would turn for a testimony instead of destroying theirs.<a name=168:14></a> They were to go on testifying, while the unhappy devoted city where they were filled up its iniquity.<a name=168:15></a> The Lord would permit trial, but not a hair of their head would be lost.<a name=168:16></a> But this would close.<a name=168:17></a> The sign given here is in no wise the abomination of desolation, but an historical fact -- Jerusalem encompassed with armies.<a name=168:18></a> Its desolation now approached.<a name=168:19></a> They were then to flee, not to return.<a name=168:20></a> These were days of vengeance (it is not said of the unprecedented tribulation, as in Matthew, which is only in the latter day).<a name=168:21></a> All that was written was to be fulfilled.<a name=168:22></a> Great distress there was in the land, and wrath on this people.<a name=168:23></a> Slaughter first and captivity afterwards wrought their cruel work of devastation, and Jerusalem till this hour abides, the boast and prey of Gentile lords, and so must it be till their day is over.<a name=168:24></a>

		In these earlier verses (8-19) the Lord dwells on the dangers, duties, and trials of the disciples before the sack of Titus.<a name=169:1></a> Specially were they to beware of a pretended deliverer, and of the cry that the time (that is, of deliverance) was at hand.<a name=169:2></a> Neither were they to be terrified by wars or commotions, any more than seduced by fair promises.<a name=169:3></a> These things must first be, but the end not immediately.<a name=169:4></a> Besides, it was not only confusion and woes and signs of coming change and evil outside.<a name=169:5></a> Before all these they themselves were to be in affliction and persecution for Christ's sake.<a name=169:6></a>

		The coming of the Son of man disclosed all the scene to the disciples.<a name=170:1></a> But it is clear from the circumstances, and especially from the character of the redemption spoken of (verse 28), that it is a question, not of Christians, but of earthly disciples, and of an earthly deliverance by judgment here below.<a name=170:2></a> The Lord in mercy turns the terror of man into a sign of deliverance for the remnant of that day.<a name=170:3></a>

		Verses 31, 32 are interesting in this point of view here, because they furnish remarkable evidence, first, that the kingdom of God does not mean the gospel of His grace; and, secondly, that this generation cannot refer to the space of time from the prophecy to the destruction of Jerusalem.<a name=170:4></a>

		1. For when they see these things coming to pass (and He had spoken of the final, universal trouble for the whole habitable earth, and not merely of what has befallen the Jews), they are to conclude that the kingdom of God is nigh.<a name=170:5></a> Now, even if it were only the Romans taking away their place and nation, and still more if it include the latter-day trouble, it is undeniable that the gospel had extended far and wide before the first.<a name=170:6></a> In fact, the manifestation of its influence was declining rather before that time, as we see in the later epistles.<a name=170:7></a> But the things here seen were signs like the budding of the trees, and the kingdom of God is evidently to be at the coming of the King, when the Lord God Almighty takes His great power and reigns.<a name=170:8></a> That there was a partial analogous judgment, when Jerusalem fell, is true, but verses 25-28 ought to leave no doubt of a wider subsequent judgment, with signs which introduce, not the sorrows of the Jews, but the Son of man coming in His kingdom.<a name=170:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		2. For a similar reason, "this generation" does not apply to a mere lifetime, but is viewed morally, as in Deuteronomy 32, Psalm 12, and many other scriptures.<a name=170:10></a> It is here expressly put at the close, after not only the fall of Jerusalem, but the totally distinct scene of Christ's coming in power and glory.<a name=170:11></a> The expression in verse 33 is very solemn.<a name=170:12></a> Deeper interests were involved than a casual change as to Jerusalem.<a name=170:13></a> The time was wrapped up in purposed obscurity, but nothing more sure than the facts predicted.<a name=170:14></a>

		I hardly know whether the thoughts I send you suit your little journal;<a href="#187:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> but I trust that all that unfolds the way the blessed Lord presented Himself on the earth, the connection of the Old Testament with the New, and the revealing of God in man upon the earth, will be profitable to some of your readers at least.<a name=187:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I forward to you therefore some remarks on the Gospel of Luke, flowing from thoughts which have arisen in my mind while lately reading it.<a name=187:2></a> There are two great subjects in the life of the blessed Lord which Luke brings out: the fulfilment of promise; and the revelation of God in grace in the "Son of man.<a name=187:3></a>" These are presented to us in the history in a very interesting way.<a name=187:4></a> I will notice this as displayed in chapters 4 and 5.<a name=187:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 4 the Spirit of God has shewn us the blessed One led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil, victorious in trial, as the first man had failed in it.<a name=187:6></a> He returns in the power of the Spirit into Galilee, having first bound the strong man.<a name=187:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let me remark here, in passing, how faithfulness in trial and temptation shews the power of the Spirit as much as the energy of action.<a name=187:8></a> Jesus was led by the Spirit to be tempted, overcame Satan by the word through the Spirit, and returned in its power, working miracles and casting out devils.<a name=187:9></a> But the power had been exercised all through the temptation, only in standing fast.<a name=187:10></a> See Ephesians 6.<a name=187:11></a> Therein He had overcome Satan, baffled his power, really bound the strong man, and then had only to spoil his goods.<a name=187:12></a> He used too the weapon we have to use, the word of God: only we must remark, as we learn from Ephesians 6, that, to use the word, we must first have all the defensive armours, that is, the state of the soul must be right.<a name=187:13></a> Christ, of course, was perfect and used it perfectly.<a name=187:14></a> In the measure of our spirituality and uprightness we shall be able to wield this blessed weapon.<a name=187:15></a> But here even the sword was a defensive weapon.<a name=187:16></a> He met the wiles of Satan by it.<a name=187:17></a> Whatever reasonings or scriptures Satan may use, if we are spiritual enough to use it, the word of God suffices to confound him.<a name=187:18></a>

		But to turn to my more direct subject.<a name=188:1></a> The Lord now stood as man, anointed of the Holy Ghost, having overcome Satan, to make good divine grace and goodness amongst men, and specially first amongst the Jews; but the glory of His divine person was not to be hid.<a name=188:2></a> But first He presents Himself as the anointed Man, fulfilling all that has been promised in grace.<a name=188:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I must remark another point.<a name=188:4></a> The Lord looks for rejection; and this, it will be seen, is the case in both the characters in which He presents Himself.<a name=188:5></a> First, then, as the anointed Man.<a name=188:6></a> "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord.<a name=188:7></a>" Thus He presents Himself as the fulfiller of promise, announcing the favourable and gracious time of God's mercy in His own person.<a name=188:8></a> "This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.<a name=188:9></a>" But at the same time He tells them that He will be rejected.<a name=188:10></a> A prophet has not honour in his own country.<a name=188:11></a> But He adds that grace, as grace, passed beyond the limits of the Jews; that God was sovereign in His goodness, and of old had sent help to two Gentiles, while many remained in sorrow in rebellious Israel.<a name=188:12></a> This the haughty Jews would not bear, and, gracious as His words had been, they are now ready to destroy Him for preaching a grace which Israel might lose all part in, as rejecting Him, and the Gentile get blessing by.<a name=188:13></a> They are ready to destroy Him; but it was not the time, and He passed through the midst of them.<a name=188:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now see the character in which the demons own Him: how it meets this character in which He was really come.<a name=188:15></a> How sad a picture!<a name=188:16></a> Demons perforce own Him; men reject Him with hatred.<a name=188:17></a> It is remarkable how these evil spirits own Him according to the truth (as we may remember the spirit of divination did Paul), but surely only as dreading, and, if they could have done so, avoiding His power.<a name=188:18></a> "Let us alone: what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth?<a name=188:19></a> art thou come to destroy us?<a name=188:20></a> I know thee who thou art; the Holy One of God.<a name=188:21></a>" It was the reluctant owning of a power they could not avoid.<a name=188:22></a> The time was not come to cast them into the pit, but to deliver man.<a name=188:23></a> The demon came out of the man at Jesus' word.<a name=188:24></a>

		But it is well to note that this title was a prophetic one of Jesus; and His title as summing up all the mercies of God.<a name=189:1></a> It is unfolded in Psalm 89.<a name=189:2></a> The word "mercies," in the first verse of that psalm, is the same as "Holy One" in verse 19: "Holy One" in verse 18 is quite different.<a name=189:3></a> Mercy was to be built up for ever, the psalm declares.<a name=189:4></a> How?<a name=189:5></a> "Thou spakest in vision of [not "to," I think, but about, as we see that of the prophecy in Psalm 72, "A Psalm about Solomon"] thy holy One,"thy gracious One, in whom help and mercy is summed up.<a name=189:6></a>" I have laid help upon One that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people.<a name=189:7></a> I have found David my servant," etc.<a name=189:8></a> Here, no doubt, the immediate subject is David: but in the mind of God a greater, even Christ, is here.<a name=189:9></a> The evil spirit owns that this Holy One is there in the person of Jesus of Nazareth.<a name=189:10></a> Help was indeed laid upon the Mighty One, who, having overcome Satan wholly, could have delivered man from all the miserable fruits of his power, even death itself; but man would have none of Him.<a name=189:11></a> He must be redeemed or lost.<a name=189:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next, in this fourth chapter, when healing many, the demons who are cast out own Him as the Christ the Son of God.<a name=189:13></a> This was owning His title as promised to Israel in Psalm a; but which also witnessed to His rejection.<a name=189:14></a> Thus the power of present delivering goodness, in the promised One, was there.<a name=189:15></a> He is owned the Holy One of God, in whom mercies came to Israel; as the Christ and Son of God spoken of in Psalm a.<a name=189:16></a> But in His own country He is not received.<a name=189:17></a> The prejudices and passions of man rise up against grace and this gracious One, while the demons own Him, but through dread; a strange but solemn picture!<a name=189:18></a> They could not but know Him.<a name=189:19></a> But what is knowledge when only such?<a name=189:20></a> Those He really came to would not receive Him.<a name=189:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 5 He is seen in another character.<a name=189:22></a> He reveals, and is, Jehovah.<a name=189:23></a> In the miraculous draught of fishes He makes Himself known to the conscience of Peter, who sees the Lord in it, and acknowledges himself a sinful man unfit for His presence.<a name=189:24></a> This is always the effect of the revelation of God to us, and indeed of nothing else.<a name=189:25></a> Jesus speaks words of grace, "Fear not.<a name=189:26></a>" From henceforth he should catch men.<a name=189:27></a> In what follows He heals the leper, which was Jehovah's work alone.<a name=189:28></a> But there was a special circumstance connected with this.<a name=189:29></a> full of blessed significance.<a name=189:30></a> The leper recognised His power, but was not sure of His goodness or willingness to help him.<a name=189:31></a> "Lord," he says, "if thou wilt thou canst make me clean.<a name=189:32></a>" The Lord does not merely say He is willing, He puts forth His hand and touches him.<a name=189:33></a> Now, if a man touched a leper he too was unclean, and must be put out of the camp.<a name=189:34></a> But here was a divine person come down, Jehovah, who could cleanse.<a name=189:35></a> One who could say, "<i>I will</i>"; "<i>be thou</i>.<a name=189:36></a>" -- One who could not be defiled, but had for that very reason come down to touch the defiled one, and remove the defilement.<a name=189:37></a> He was Jehovah, come as man, to touch, so to speak, the sinner in grace.<a name=189:38></a> Jesus was one whose holiness was so perfect, as God become man, that He could carry divine love to the vilest -- carry it wherever a need or a sorrow was, and as love touch the defiled, not to become so, but to heal.<a name=189:39></a> It is a wonderful picture of what Christ, Jehovah, present to heal was in this world.<a name=189:40></a> Thus revealing Himself to the conscience, and doing a divine work in love, in what was a figure of cleansing from sin, mark Him out as Jehovah in the world in grace.<a name=189:41></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He withdraws Himself into the wilderness and prays; ever the dependent, as the obedient and victorious, man.<a name=190:1></a> But other elements of divine grace are yet to be observed here.<a name=190:2></a> He was sitting with doctors of the law, ready to object to grace, and ignorant of how the Son of God had in manhood visited this sinful world in the power and title of divine grace.<a name=190:3></a> One sick of the palsy is brought to Him by faith.<a name=190:4></a> He goes to the root of all sorrow, and says, "Thy sins be forgiven thee.<a name=190:5></a>" The question is not here how through the precious death of Christ forgiveness was consistent with divine righteousness and glorified it.<a name=190:6></a> What is here revealed is Jehovah present in unmingled grace.<a name=190:7></a> As the testimony and witness of this, the Lord does what is ascribed to Jehovah in Psalm 103, along with the forgiveness of sins.<a name=190:8></a> "Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; and healeth all thy diseases.<a name=190:9></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Lastly, the Lord shews, as the friend of publicans and sinners, that He had come in sovereign grace to gather, in the power of good, not looking for it in man.<a name=190:10></a> But thus also He must be rejected.<a name=190:11></a> This new wine, for it was so, could not be put into old bottles; Judaism could not receive and be the vessel of sovereign grace; nor could those who were used to Judaism easily receive the new wine of the gospel and Spirit of God.<a name=190:12></a> And so it ever is in all ages.<a name=190:13></a>

		CHAPTER 7
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not for the present make any remark on chapter 6.<a name=191:1></a> Only we may note that the Lord is gathering distinctly around Himself, apart from the nation, and that He addresses His disciples as thus separated -- as those already called to possess the kingdom.<a name=191:2></a> But in chapter 7 we have the Lord brought out in a far greater character, and more fully revealed, than as the fulfiller of promise.<a name=191:3></a> He is entirely a divine person, and consequently reaches out beyond Judaism, and even human life, in this world.<a name=191:4></a> Still the Jews are recognised by the Gentile whom the Lord blesses; and this was right.<a name=191:5></a> The Lord did the same.<a name=191:6></a> It was the lowliness and submission to God's ways which the knowledge of God, true faith, always produces.<a name=191:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Remark here, too, a principle which will be found to shine forth through all the Gospels, namely, that whenever Christ was manifested as God, it was impossible that He could be confined to His relationship to the Jews.<a name=191:8></a> God present in His own nature, as love, cannot be confined to the special relationships to a nation to whom He has made promises: although He may, and surely will, faithfully meet them according to promise.<a name=191:9></a> This is largely and specially brought out in John: where, indeed, however, the principle reaches further, and thereby assumes another character.<a name=191:10></a> The Jews are there looked at, already, in the first chapter, as reprobate, and so treated; though dealt with, still, all through the Gospel.<a name=191:11></a> "He came to his own, and his own received him not.<a name=191:12></a>" The world, too, is viewed as blind.<a name=191:13></a> "The world knew him not.<a name=191:14></a>" It was that phenomenon known only in morals, the light shining in darkness.<a name=191:15></a> The effect of this is to bring out the Lord in two characters in that Gospel -- first, as God, as light in the world, and as such, when forcing the conscience to attend to Him, bringing out the terrible truth that men love darkness rather than light -- that they will not have God such as He is: this especially, and formally, in chapter 8, when His word is rejected, as His work is in the ninth.<a name=191:16></a> But this makes a turning-point in the Gospel after the first three chapters, which are preface.<a name=191:17></a> The first, Christ in nature -- Christ incarnate -- Christ in work of blessing on earth -- Christ (as John Baptist also) calling and gathering on the earth; which reaches on, by His servants, to His millennial presence on earth; in all which, note, no heavenly character or office of Christ is given, as is ever the case in John's writings.<a name=191:18></a> The second gives the millennial kingdom.<a name=191:19></a> The third what is needed for the kingdom, and heavenly things: where John also brings out His full person and glory in grace.<a name=191:20></a> Then being driven out of Judea, the new order of things is intimated, from God's nature and the Father's love, in the fourth chapter.<a name=191:21></a> Thereon, to the end of the seventh, Christ is presented as the divine life-giving Son of God; in incarnation, and as the dying Son of man; the Giver of the Spirit, as the feast of tabernacles, the figure of earthly rest, could not yet be kept by Him.<a name=191:22></a> Then, His word being rejected in the eighth, in the ninth He gives sight, and this brings in effectual grace; and, rejected though He be, He will have His sheep.<a name=191:23></a> Here we have not simply God, who is light in darkness, revealed, but the Father sending the Son in grace.<a name=191:24></a> This distinction is always kept up in John.<a name=191:25></a> When grace is spoken of it is the Father and the Son!<a name=191:26></a> the Father sending the Son; while as mere light, it is God.<a name=191:27></a> But this expression of Father and Son refers to grace revealed and effectual, not to the love of God in His nature and character.<a name=191:28></a> Where this is spoken of, it is still God.<a name=191:29></a> "God so loved the world.<a name=191:30></a>" I may follow this Gospel and its character more in detail, if it suit you and the Lord so will, another time; but this leads me back to the general truth that Christ as revealing God shines necessarily out beyond Israel.<a name=191:31></a>

		Thus, in a very striking and beautiful example, the Syrophenician woman.<a name=192:1></a> There the Lord seems to hold back and confine Himself to Israel.<a name=192:2></a> "I am not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.<a name=192:3></a>" "It is not meet to take the children's bread and to cast it to the dogs.<a name=192:4></a>" The poor woman says, "Truth, Lord, but the dogs eat of the crumbs that fall from their master's table.<a name=192:5></a>" Could He say, God is not so good as you suppose?<a name=192:6></a> He has no crumbs for the wretched, who even look to Him through grace?<a name=192:7></a> Impossible.<a name=192:8></a> It would have been denying, not revealing, God; and her faith is at once met.<a name=192:9></a> Remark, too, again here, how lowly faith is, and how it submits to God's sovereign will!<a name=192:10></a> She owns herself a dog, and the privilege of being near God, as Israel was, as a nation.<a name=192:11></a> But her faith pierces through the difficulty, with a want, to Him who revealed God in love; and divine goodness, which had taught her to trust in it, met, and could not but meet, that confiding trust.<a name=192:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In this Gospel we constantly find the Lord going over the same ground again and again, in different aspects; but here He is pressing the rejection of His own person, not in connection with the kingdom, but in connection with men's souls.<a name=196:13></a> It is not the kingdom as being set aside by His rejection, nor yet the connection of men's souls and bodies with Him in future earthly glory -- such as blessing the basket and the store -- but the blessing of their souls for ever; therefore what is pressed here is the relationship of the soul with God.<a name=196:14></a> On this ground He says a man is but a "fool," that "layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.<a name=196:15></a>" For "what is a man profited if he gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?<a name=196:16></a> or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?<a name=196:17></a>" He thus takes them off all dispensational teaching, to put them on the broad moral ground of the soul's relationship to God; and then shews them the consequence of discipleship with Himself.<a name=196:18></a>

		But first He puts before the disciples some of the motives which should actuate them as His disciples (verse 19).<a name=197:4></a> "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy, for there is nothing hid that shall not be made known.<a name=197:5></a>" It will all come out before God: whatever is said or done, it will all come out before God.<a name=197:6></a> Having made this appeal to their consciences, the next thing is, that He being rejected, power will be on the side of evil.<a name=197:7></a> Power would be there, and it would be against them: still not one single hair of their head was unnumbered.<a name=197:8></a> This was for their comfort!<a name=197:9></a> but as to the government on earth by Christ, that was now closed for the present, and, Christ as Messiah being rejected, they must be rejected too, and bear the cross like their Master, being left down here in the midst of the power of evil unsubdued.<a name=197:10></a> So thoroughly indeed was power on the side of evil, that when the Lord was casting out a demon, the people said, "He casteth out demons through Beelzebub the chief of the demons.<a name=197:11></a>" The principle brought out in this is, that the saints are now down here in conflict with evil, but they are not to be afraid.<a name=197:12></a> "Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do; but I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear; fear him which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, fear him.<a name=197:13></a>" Think of your souls as being connected with God.<a name=197:14></a> The hairs of your head are all numbered.<a name=197:15></a> If men kill your body, do not be afraid; for they cannot touch your soul; and not a single hair of your head shall perish.<a name=197:16></a> You may be cut off by an ignominious death.<a name=197:17></a> What then?<a name=197:18></a> Why, "not a sparrow falls to the ground without your Father.<a name=197:19></a>" "Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows.<a name=197:20></a>"

		But notice how the divine person of the Lord comes out here, "O!<a name=219:14></a> Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how often would I have gathered .<a name=219:15></a>.<a name=219:16></a>.<a name=219:17></a> and ye would not!<a name=219:18></a>" Now a prophet could not say this.<a name=219:19></a> Though Christ was a prophet, it is true, still He was more than a prophet.<a name=219:20></a> He was Jehovah; for none but Jehovah could gather Israel.<a name=219:21></a> As it is said, "He that scattered Israel will gather him.<a name=219:22></a>" Israel had rejected Jehovah, when under responsibility; but Jehovah will own them when He comes in grace.<a name=219:23></a> The church will go up to heaven, and the kingdom will be set up on the earth.<a name=219:24></a> And mark how the deity of our blessed Lord shines out again and again in the Gospels, while at the same moment the humanity remained so perfect.<a name=219:25></a> And here I would say a word or two as to the way of bringing this blessed fact out.<a name=219:26></a> For surely the circumstances through which the Lord passed in His path down here did bring out in a far brighter way WHO HE WAS, than any text that could be adduced to prove it.<a name=219:27></a> Not that I would set aside any text, but suppose you believed there was a God as a truth; if He were to come down by your very side and say, Here I AM, would not that be a very different thing?<a name=219:28></a> And though Christ was the humbled Man all through His path here (for He was ever the servant of all), yet when the service was of no use, then it was that God shone out.<a name=219:29></a> "Before Abraham was, I AM.<a name=219:30></a>" See Luke 13: 33, 34.<a name=219:31></a> The moment He said, I must die, since you reject Me, immediately Jehovah shone out.<a name=219:32></a> "O!<a name=219:33></a> Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how often would I have gathered thee" -- and who could gather ISRAEL but Jehovah Himself?<a name=219:34></a> -- "but ye would not," therefore "your house is left unto you desolate <i>until</i> ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.<a name=219:35></a>"

		The complaint in the Psalms is, that there is none to say, "How long?<a name=220:1></a>" -- none to count upon the faithfulness of Jehovah to His people.<a name=220:2></a> (See Psalm 74.<a name=220:3></a>) The expression, "How long?<a name=220:4></a>" is often used in the Psalms, and in Isaiah 6 it refers to chastening, and not retribution.<a name=220:5></a> How long is Israel to stumble or fall?<a name=220:6></a> (Romans 11).<a name=220:7></a> In Isaiah 6 the prophet having uttered those words, "Make the heart of this people fat," etc.<a name=220:8></a>, taken up by the Lord in John 12, the prophet then says, "How long?<a name=220:9></a>" He was in the faith of God and reckoning upon God, and having God's mind, he cannot believe that God will give them up, and therefore asks, "how long" the chastening is to continue.<a name=220:10></a> To which the Lord God answers, "There shall be a great forsaking in the midst of the land, but in it there shall be a tenth, and so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof.<a name=220:11></a>" The sap is still there, though there be no leaves.<a name=220:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So in Psalm 118, "Jehovah hath chastened me sore, but he hath not given me over unto death.<a name=220:13></a>" In the same way, the Lord does not say, Your house is left unto you desolate, and therefore you shall not see me again.<a name=220:14></a> No, but He says, "Ye shall not see me, <i>until</i> ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of Jehovah.<a name=220:15></a>" He can give as Jehovah, in grace, the answer, and when He gives repentance to Israel, then He will send Jesus -- whom, until then, the heavens have received-and then our connection with Him comes in.<a name=220:16></a> The prophets spoke only of earthly things, though divine; but to the church it is "Holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling!<a name=220:17></a>" You hath He made to sit together with Him in the heavenly places, and that gives security.<a name=220:18></a> How did I get in there?<a name=220:19></a> By virtue of Christ; He is my title and is He not a good title?<a name=220:20></a> My desires are to be acquainted with this, that I am one with Christ in heaven.<a name=220:21></a> And these are my desires in fact, and that is what the Holy Ghost seals upon my soul, and we get it as our everlasting portion.<a name=220:22></a> When Israel is brought to repentance, then "the stone which the builders rejected will be the head of the corner," and owned of them.<a name=220:23></a> They will say, "O!<a name=220:24></a> give thanks unto Jehovah, for his mercy endureth for ever.<a name=220:25></a>" Alas, they will receive another first!<a name=220:26></a> But when their hearts are turned and grace works, then they will use the language of Psalm 119, and find the expression of the law within their hearts, and when faith is thus exercised, and their hearts are broken and open to receive Him, then He Himself will come to them.<a name=220:27></a> If there is not a prophet to say, "How long?<a name=220:28></a>" then Jehovah Himself will give the answer.<a name=220:29></a>

		And though applied to Israel here, yet we may learn what the Lord is, for He never changes, and though He executes judgment in righteousness, grace is found in His heart for faith to lay hold of.<a name=221:1></a> "When he cometh shall he find faith on the earth?<a name=221:2></a>" Well, if there be not faith to be found, or a prophet to be found, there is One who will lay up in His treasures something for faith to lay hold of in the sovereignty of His grace.<a name=221:3></a> We see Jehovah in that humble one, that Nazarene, and see how He is able to rise above all iniquity; and thus to see Jehovah shining out through it all, how precious He becomes to us!<a name=221:4></a> That we are one with Him should endear Him to our hearts, and in learning Him may He give us to follow Him.<a name=221:5></a>

		ON THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO JOHN
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a general remark as to John's Gospel which will astonish some perhaps; that, except in three cases, John has nothing to do with heaven.<a name=222:1></a> In these alone you have heaven.<a name=222:2></a> "What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?<a name=222:3></a>" "I go to prepare a place for you," and "Those whom thou hast given me be with me where I am," in chapters 6, 14, and 17; and in these it is only thrown out in a way.<a name=222:4></a> John's Gospel is really the manifestation of God to men down here in the person of Christ, and the coming of the Holy Ghost, with the declaration of Christ's coming again.<a name=222:5></a> I merely indicate the character of the Gospel in saying so: you do not get any ascension either at the end of it.<a name=222:6></a> Let me first give you a summary of it.<a name=222:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 1 you get Christ's person, and incarnation and work, or rather, perhaps, what He does than His work.<a name=222:8></a> All His essential names are there, not His relative ones.<a name=222:9></a> You do not get Him as Head of the church, or as High Priest, nor as the Christ, which are His relationships; for He is not revealed as Christ in verse 41.<a name=222:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 2, having His title as Son of man at the close of the first, we hear of His millennial work in the marriage, and the clearing of the temple, up to the end of verse 22.<a name=222:11></a> Verses 23 and 24 are connected with chapter 3, where we see not only Christ's total rejection by man, but the setting aside of the natural man, the new birth and the cross.<a name=222:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These three chapters are before His entry on His public ministry.<a name=222:13></a> We know this, because John was not yet cast into prison, and from the other Gospels we learn it was after John was cast into prison, that He went out into His public ministry.<a name=222:14></a> In chapter 4 He leaves Judaea, the place of promise, of the temple, and all that, and sets aside Jerusalem and Samaria, bringing the gift of God down to the earth in grace.<a name=222:15></a> He sets up spiritual worship, and the old thing is set aside altogether.<a name=222:16></a> Then, in Galilee, He brings the power of life to man where he is, and heals the nobleman's son.<a name=222:17></a> In chapter 5 He is the quickening Son of God along with the Father, and the judging Son of man alone.<a name=222:18></a> He is Son of God in judging too.<a name=222:19></a> In chapter 6, He is the humbled Son of man incarnate and dying, and the food of the saints while He is away.<a name=222:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 7 the Holy Ghost is substituted for His manifestation to the world.<a name=222:21></a> Of course it is only the main idea I am giving you now.<a name=222:22></a> In chapter 8 His word is rejected.<a name=222:23></a> In chapter 9 His work is rejected.<a name=222:24></a> In chapter 10 He has His sheep in spite of all.<a name=222:25></a> In chapter 11 being rejected and having His sheep, God bears testimony to Him as Son of God in the power of resurrection.<a name=222:26></a> In chapter 12 He is owned by spiritual intelligence as the dying one (which comes in most beautifully in a little parenthesis), and then as Son of David, King of Israel, and Son of man; you get the three here, Son of God, Son of David, and Son of man.<a name=222:27></a> In chapter 13 He still remains the servant.<a name=222:28></a> As He cannot remain with His disciples here, He abides a servant, though gone to God, to fit them to be with Him there.<a name=222:29></a> At the end you have the last supper, and Judas, and then the cross, but in the character of His glorifying God there.<a name=222:30></a> In chapter 14 He is telling them that He would come again to receive them, and He gives them what would be their comfort, while He was away; having revealed the Father in His own person, and then they in Him and He in them, known by them through the presence of the Holy Ghost.<a name=222:31></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 15 He is Himself the true vine on the earth, Israel is not; and He sends the Comforter to reveal His heavenly glory while His disciples bear witness, through the Comforter, of what He had been on earth.<a name=222:32></a> In chapter 16 we have the action of the Comforter on earth towards the world and in the church; they were to ask in His name which they had not done yet.<a name=222:33></a> In chapter 17 to the end of verse 23 He puts them completely into His own place on earth toward the Father, and towards the world, He being glorified; and in the last verses He wills that they should be brought into the same place with Him in heaven.<a name=222:34></a> In chapter 18 you begin the last history of Gethsemane, and so on.<a name=222:35></a> In chapter 19 remark that you have no human suffering, but divine power in it all; they scourge Him and you get all the facts about it, not that He did not suffer, but it is not that part that is brought out: people fall back to the ground instead of His sweating great drops of blood; you have the divine side, I mean.<a name=222:36></a> In chapter 20 you have the whole condition of believers from the first revelation of the fact of His resurrection and ascension until the remnant believe by seeing.<a name=222:37></a> In chapter 21 you get Christ ministerially represented as come again in the millennial times and the services of Peter and John until then, Peter to be cut off, but John to go on.<a name=222:38></a> It is the beginning of the millennium and of the history of Peter and John in the interval from Christ's death.<a name=222:39></a> Paul's ministry is not found there.<a name=222:40></a> Now let us go back.<a name=222:41></a>

		In the very outset Christ came to the world, and the world knew him not, and He came to His own and His own received Him not; consequently the Jews are treated as reprobates; but He has come from the Father into the world.<a name=224:1></a> It is what some might call a Calvinistic gospel; consequently it shews the sovereign grace which leads anybody to receive Christ or own Him at all.<a name=224:2></a> They are born of God, not of the will of man.<a name=224:3></a> Therefore, too, He has His sheep; and this characterises the Gospel.<a name=224:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The truth is entirely abstract in the first five verses except five words.<a name=224:5></a> The Gospel itself begins before Genesis.<a name=224:6></a> In Genesis you have the responsible creation; but here "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God," a very distinct statement of the eternity of Christ.<a name=224:7></a> There is the being of the Word, He is the Word, the <i>Logos</i>, the expression of God's mind, for Word is both -- it is what we were speaking of once before as the intelligent and the intelligible.<a name=224:8></a> Christ is the expression, and the <i>Logos</i> too, because He is God.<a name=224:9></a> When the expression only is meant it is <i>rheema</i>, not <i>logos</i>.<a name=224:10></a> But <i>logos</i> takes up what the mind is as having a thought, or it expresses the mind.<a name=224:11></a> All the wisdom of God is in Christ, He is it, and besides He is the expression of it.<a name=224:12></a> Then you get another thing, and that is, personal distinction, -- "the Word was with God," -- something in a personal sense distinct.<a name=224:13></a> And then "the Word was God," and that is the nature.<a name=224:14></a> It is very full, though brief.<a name=224:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 2 meets what was a common difficulty that He only became into personal distinctness when God began to act.<a name=224:16></a> Of course it is a mere notion, but it is met here: "He was in the beginning with God.<a name=224:17></a>" Then in verse 3 I come to the beginning of Genesis.<a name=224:18></a> "All things were made by him, and without him was not anything made that was made.<a name=224:19></a>" He is Creator as to things outside Himself.<a name=224:20></a> And then I get what is inside Himself, "in him was life.<a name=224:21></a>" Very full all this, as to the divine person and glory of the Lord.<a name=224:22></a> And another thing, "and the life was the light of men.<a name=224:23></a>" God is light in His nature, but here is specific appropriation in the second person.<a name=224:24></a> It is in form too a reciprocal expression.<a name=224:25></a> Wisdom always had man in its thoughts; the angels come into creation, but the life was the light of men, and therefore He became a man.<a name=224:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=225>[Page 225]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then I get the judgment of the world, and of "his own," "the light shineth in darkness" -- a thing impossible in nature, for if the light there shone in darkness, there would be no darkness for it to shine in.<a name=225:1></a> The judgment of the world is the consequence, for "the darkness comprehended it not.<a name=225:2></a>" "The light shineth in darkness" is abstract too; He does not say "shone.<a name=225:3></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then comes another truth of immense import.<a name=225:4></a> "There was a man sent from God," that is, God took pains with men to bring them to apprehend this light.<a name=225:5></a> He sends this messenger to draw people's attention; "the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe.<a name=225:6></a>" All to no purpose it might be, but still there was the painstaking of God.<a name=225:7></a> "He was not that light, but was sent to bear witness of that light.<a name=225:8></a>" Here we get this name of light (we have nothing of love yet), the purest thing we have any idea of, and which manifests everything else.<a name=225:9></a> It is light that makes all things manifest; but it is a thing too which is perfect purity.<a name=225:10></a> That is the true light which, on coming into the world, lights every man.<a name=225:11></a> It was not a mere Jewish thing: we have got far away out of that now, but it comes into the world; it is not a question of promises here, but of nature and counsels.<a name=225:12></a> God in His counsels had to say to men, and light comes into the world; He was in the world, and the world was made by Him, and the world knew Him not.<a name=225:13></a> Man had not the sense to see that the person who made him was in the world, and its light.<a name=225:14></a> And He came to the Jews, and they would not receive Him either.<a name=225:15></a> So there was the judgment of everything.<a name=225:16></a> You have got the world, and its pitch-darkness; and the Jews -- His own -- will not have Him: "there is none that understandeth or that seeketh after God.<a name=225:17></a>" Job 38: 1-7, refers to the same: only that these very singers were created too; so that Job does not go quite so wide.<a name=225:18></a> John 1: 3 is before the beginning of Genesis when you think of the angels.<a name=225:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have got what Christ was, abstractly, and the result was that nobody received Him.<a name=225:20></a> They had no understanding, and no will; and now, consequently, we get grace working, "but to as many as received him, to them gave he power<a href="#225:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> to become children of God.<a name=225:21></a>" It is not merely that they got light and blessing, but He gave them a place, "children of God," "born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor the will of man, but of God.<a name=225:22></a>" I have the action of grace, and, where the action of grace is, they do receive Him.<a name=225:23></a>

		If we are to distinguish the phrases in verse 13, "of flesh" is the nature more; "of man" is the being; "flesh" is the characteristic, "man" is general.<a name=226:1></a> "Not of blood.<a name=226:2></a>" A Jew was born of blood and thought himself a son of the kingdom; but it was not of the will of the flesh either -- Gentile, if you please.<a name=226:3></a> This closes on God's part what He was; and it closes on man's part too; and then there is the grace that comes in.<a name=226:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the Word is looked at as become flesh.<a name=226:5></a> In verse 14 a new part commences.<a name=226:6></a> Before, it was what He was; now, what He became <i>(what He began to be)</i>.<a name=226:7></a> The Word became flesh and dwelt among us; it was a real thing, not like God visiting Abraham; but He dwelt among us, tabernacled there "and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth, and of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.<a name=226:8></a>" His own incarnate character and our connection with it.<a name=226:9></a> The part about John the Baptist comes in in the middle.<a name=226:10></a> But there is the statement, "the Word was made flesh": and then you get the aspect He had.<a name=226:11></a> We beheld His glory, not of the Son as such, but as of an only-begotten with a Father.<a name=226:12></a> He had all the title of that excellency and value in everything.<a name=226:13></a> All that that was to the Father was with Him.<a name=226:14></a> It is His personal glory made visible in flesh.<a name=226:15></a> When He was made flesh, we get a witness of John (verse 15), just as before, saying, "This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me, for he was before me.<a name=226:16></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		The difference between only-begotten <i>(monogenees)</i> and first-born <i>(prototokos)</i>, is that the first is His relationship to God eternally; the second is His relationship to other things.<a name=226:17></a> Thus, "I will make him my first-born, higher than the kings of the earth," in Psalm 89.<a name=226:18></a> This is not what He is essentially.<a name=226:19></a> He was light -- the revealer of the Father.<a name=226:20></a> "Have I been so long time with you and yet hast thou not known me, Philip?<a name=226:21></a> He that hath seen me hath seen the Father.<a name=226:22></a>" "The light shineth in darkness" is real, and it is by incarnation; but John is not taking it up in an historical way, only the fact of light and life.<a name=226:23></a> "The law was given by Moses, but grace and truth," he does not say were given, but "came by Jesus Christ" -- they were in His person.<a name=226:24></a>

		As to the force of the use of the names "God" and "Father" in the Gospel of John, and pretty much in his Epistle, as a general rule, when you speak of our responsibility or the nature of things, you get "God.<a name=227:15></a>" But when the ways of grace are unfolded, you get the Father and the Son; there are certain exceptions which only confirm it.<a name=227:16></a> "God so loved the world that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but have everlasting life.<a name=227:17></a>" It was essential to put "God" in there, because it was as God He did it.<a name=227:18></a> "The Father sent the Son to be Saviour of the world.<a name=227:19></a>" "And this is life eternal that they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.<a name=227:20></a>" "No man hath seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.<a name=227:21></a>" That is a most blessed sentence; though the word "love" is not there, it is the perfection of it.<a name=227:22></a> We cannot know God by seeing Him; but the only-begotten Son, in whom is concentrated all the Father's delight, and who is in the bosom of the Father, hath declared Him.<a name=227:23></a> The Son comes and declares the Father as He knows Him in His bosom, just as the Father enjoys the Son as the object of His delight and love.<a name=227:24></a> If I were to tell you what my father was in his love, I should tell you what he was to me; and Christ comes and tells us all this Himself, and therefore He could say, "He hath that seen me hath seen the Father.<a name=227:25></a>" In another sense He "came forth from the Father and came into the world.<a name=227:26></a>"

		There never was a time when the Son was so dear to the Father as on the cross.<a name=228:1></a> "Therefore doth my Father love me because I lay down my life that I may take it again.<a name=228:2></a>" That is, if you look at Him as a Son with His Father.<a name=228:3></a> If you take Him as actually suffering being made sin, He could as such have no joy in God.<a name=228:4></a> He was forsaken in His soul of God.<a name=228:5></a> That is quite true, if you are looking at judicial action in respect of sin.<a name=228:6></a> He could not then have any enjoyment of communion with God.<a name=228:7></a> The principal part of the cross was the interruption of the communion, but the complacency of the Father in the Son was never so great.<a name=228:8></a> It is a misapprehension of relationships which has made confusion here.<a name=228:9></a> My father is a man; but suppose I were to go and say to him "my man, so-and-so," it would deny the relationship between us; but if he says to me "my boy," it is very natural, because it is the expression of the relationship.<a name=228:10></a> You will never get the value of such things by putting them into a cut-and-dry form.<a name=228:11></a> Suppose I were to try to act the son to somebody, I should in that case slip out something all wrong as sure as possible.<a name=228:12></a> If the judge were my father, and I go into court, there I should say to him, "my lord"; but this would not be to deny him as my father.<a name=228:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 18 is the revelation of the Father in the world, and it is striking, if we compare it with John's first epistle.<a name=228:14></a> In that he says, "No man hath seen God at any time; if we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us!<a name=228:15></a>" We know that by the Holy Ghost.<a name=228:16></a> Here the only-begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father He hath declared Him.<a name=228:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I think that very often there is defect among Christians as to relationship, and their apprehension of it; that is, they do not live in the present consciousness of it; they come even in worship in a certain sense through Christ -- no man ever came in any other way -- but there is not the sense of what the Lord means when He says the "Father himself loveth you.<a name=228:18></a>" There is no consciousness of that; it is rather persons outside, conscious they can get in.<a name=228:19></a> Of course they never could get in but by Christ.<a name=228:20></a>

		Then comes John's mission, preparing the way before Him.<a name=229:1></a> He says, "I baptize you with water, but there standeth one among you whom ye know not; he it is who coming after me is preferred before me.<a name=229:2></a>" John gives the divine person of Christ and bears testimony to Him.<a name=229:3></a> So that we now have had three things: the abstract nature of Christ; then Christ incarnate; then as the revealer of the Father.<a name=229:4></a> And we have John's testimony to these; and He who was divine and incarnate, and the revealer of the Father, dwelt among us "full of grace and truth.<a name=229:5></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in verse 29 we come to His work.<a name=229:6></a> He is "the Lamb of God," and He "baptizes with the Holy Ghost.<a name=229:7></a>" Those are the two parts of His work; He is not only a Lamb, who takes away the sin of the world, but He gathers a peculiar people by the Holy Ghost too.<a name=229:8></a> You notice it is not "taketh away the sins," nor "has taken" away the sin; you never get either.<a name=229:9></a> Often people say Christ has taken away original sin and so on; here it simply says He is the doer of it.<a name=229:10></a> It points Him out as such.<a name=229:11></a> He is in every sense God's Lamb, He is of God and suited to God, and the effect of the work of this Lamb is the removal of all sin totally out of the world, away from God's sight; He takes it clean away.<a name=229:12></a> The first Adam was set up an innocent man; but the moment he became a sinful man, all that God did and does now as to the world He does in respect of sin.<a name=229:13></a> If He judges, it is for sins; if He forgives and shews grace it refers to sin, whatever He does in government must have reference to that.<a name=229:14></a> There is sin, and God must act in respect of it now; when the new heavens come and the new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness, then the ground of relationship between God and the world will be righteousness instead of sin, or indeed instead of innocence either.<a name=229:15></a> It is based upon accomplished redemption which never can lose its value, and therefore the ground of relationship is immutable in the nature of things.<a name=229:16></a> And that ground is already laid, though the thing itself has not yet come.<a name=229:17></a> We have justification and peace and reconciliation.<a name=229:18></a> This is however only one particular part of the result; in the new heavens and new earth the whole result will be completely fulfilled.<a name=229:19></a> The result is not produced in manifestation at all as yet.<a name=229:20></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus verse 29 has no reference to time.<a name=230:1></a> Christ is the taker away of sin.<a name=230:2></a> It is just the same as in Hebrews 2, "He that sanctifieth, and they who are sanctified, are all of one.<a name=230:3></a>" It is not there that they are going to be sanctified, or that they have been sanctified, but simply those are the people.<a name=230:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we have His work as the Lamb of God, and the next thing is John bearing record, saying, "I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.<a name=230:5></a>" And then follows the great fact that, besides accomplishing redemption, He is the baptizer with the Holy Ghost.<a name=230:6></a> The first thing is, He is the one who takes sin clean out of the world, and then His work being accomplished brings the redeemed into the full blessing of sons.<a name=230:7></a> He first, note, takes His place among men and receives the Holy Ghost before He becomes the giver of it to others.<a name=230:8></a> And He is marked as Son of God in that place.<a name=230:9></a> It is a beautiful expression of the way in which Christ found Himself among us.<a name=230:10></a> And then heaven was opened the moment He took His place with the remnant and was baptized -- the Holy Ghost comes down on Him, and the Father says, That is My Son.<a name=230:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was the Son that created in Hebrews 1, and in Colossians 1; and as to being Son in the eternal state, He says, "I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world "; again, "I leave the world and go to the Father "; and you have no Father if you have no Son.<a name=230:12></a> If I do not know Him as Son when He came into the world, I have no mission from God at all.<a name=230:13></a> And you get too the Father sent the Son.<a name=230:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Son of the Father" and "Son of God" are the same essentially, only one is personal relationship, the other nature.<a name=230:15></a> But there are persons who take it that Christ was only Son as come into the world.<a name=230:16></a> The positive answer is given to this in Hebrews and Colossians, that by Him, the Son, the world was made.<a name=230:17></a> He is also called Son as born into this world.<a name=230:18></a> There is "This day have I begotten thee," in Psalm 2.<a name=230:19></a> That is not quite the same thing, though the same person, of course.<a name=230:20></a> He was begotten in time, that is true as to His human estate.<a name=230:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But Hebrews and Colossians are conclusive.<a name=230:22></a> It is of immense import, because I have not the Father's love sending the Son out of heaven, if I have not Him as Son before born into the world.<a name=230:23></a> The Son gives up the kingdom to the Father in 1 Corinthians 15.<a name=230:24></a> I lose all that the Son is, if He is only so as incarnate, and you have lost all the love of the Father in sending the Son as well.<a name=230:25></a> "I have declared thy name and will declare it," will declare it is now.<a name=230:26></a> He did it on earth, and does still, and I believe will do it to all eternity if you take the general statement of Scripture.<a name=230:27></a>

		In Acts 13 you will find Paul, after speaking of other things, says in verse 33, "God hath raised up Jesus" (not "again"; which ought not to be there), and so in Acts 3: 26, "God having raised up his Servant Jesus" (not Son; Peter never states that Jesus is the Son of God); so in chapter 13, "he hath raised him up," as it is written in Psalm 2.<a name=231:1></a> "Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee"; and then he goes on to prove resurrection by quoting another text: "I will give you the sure mercies of David.<a name=231:2></a>" The sureness of them is the proof they were in resurrection not dependent on failing man, and then by resurrection He was declared to be the Son of God with power.<a name=231:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in verses 35, 36 you get again, "The next day after John stood and two of his disciples, and looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God.<a name=231:4></a>" In this we have not John's public ministry that had not produced the effect; but the going out of his own heart at the sight of the Lamb of God.<a name=231:5></a> "And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.<a name=231:6></a>" And then Christ -- which to me is most important -- Christ accepts the being a centre.<a name=231:7></a> He "saith unto them, What seek ye?<a name=231:8></a>" They said unto Him, "Where dwellest thou?<a name=231:9></a>" "He saith unto them, Come and see.<a name=231:10></a>" Christ becomes a centre.<a name=231:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Again in verse 43 Christ says to Philip, "Follow me"; and this intimates another thing to me, which is, the only right path through the world where there is no path and nothing right.<a name=231:12></a> We are accustomed to think we have a way to trace; but a way to trace proves the world is in ruin and nothing right with us.<a name=231:13></a> If a man is in a right place, he has no way to find out; but if I am in a wrong place, there is no right way there.<a name=231:14></a> Suppose my son scampers off away from me to Brazil, there is no right way for him until he comes back; for all he is doing does but carry on his error of being away from his father.<a name=231:15></a> In Eden and in heaven there is no way to find.<a name=231:16></a> If I have got to find a way, it is because I am in a wrong place; but here I find Christ is the way, and Christ is the centre, and He accepts it too.<a name=231:17></a> The days are numbered from verse 34 when the gathering of the godly remnant around Jesus begins.<a name=231:18></a> First through John the Baptist's ministry, and the day following Jesus Himself gathers; and this takes up all the time right on to the remnant at the end represented by Nathanael, a remnant then and a remnant to the end.<a name=231:19></a> Philip found Nathanael and said unto him, "We have found him of whom Moses in the law and the prophets did write, Jesus of Nazareth the son of Joseph.<a name=231:20></a>" There is the greatest prejudice in Nathanael, but there is uprightness.<a name=231:21></a> "Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?<a name=231:22></a>" "Come and see.<a name=231:23></a>" Nathanael asks, "Whence knowest thou me?<a name=231:24></a>" "Before that Philip called thee when thou wast under the fig tree; I saw thee.<a name=231:25></a>" Nathanael answers, "Rabbi, thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Israel.<a name=231:26></a>" This is the confession of Psalm 2.<a name=231:27></a> That is Christ's Jewish place.<a name=231:28></a> Jesus answered and said, "Because I said unto thee I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou?<a name=231:29></a> Thou shalt see greater things than these.<a name=231:30></a>" And He said unto him, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, Henceforth ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.<a name=231:31></a>" This is Psalm 8.<a name=231:32></a> I get Nathanael as a remnant owning Christ in His place there, and then comes "Ye shall see greater things than these" -- ye shall see all creation -- the angels -- subject to the Son of man.<a name=231:33></a> "Under the fig tree" was really the Jew, and God knew him there.<a name=231:34></a> The fig tree is symbolic of Judaism.<a name=231:35></a> That gives us the whole, the abstract nature of Christ, His incarnation, His work, gathering others, and calling by John the Baptist and by Christ; then the owning of Him as in Psalm 2, and finally His place in Psalm 8.<a name=231:36></a>

		Chapter 3 is immensely important; for you get in it a complete judgment of human nature, the absolute testimony to what man is, but the bringing in of the complete grace that meets it too.<a name=233:6></a> The last three verses of chapter 2 belong really to chapter 3; and there you get that men could believe in Christ in a certain kind of way, and yet it is good for nothing.<a name=233:7></a> It was not insincerity, nor is it so now, often; but it is a human conviction there justly drawn from His miracles now.<a name=233:8></a> That has arisen perhaps from education or human causes, but it was all in man and of man.<a name=233:9></a> The moment other motives and stronger came before them, they cry out, "Crucify him.<a name=233:10></a>"

		In Nicodemus we find a want that is something more than that.<a name=233:11></a> The moment a want is thus felt, there is a consciousness that the world will be against you; and so he goes by night.<a name=233:12></a> There is a real want in his soul.<a name=233:13></a> He goes to Christ and follows up the impression.<a name=233:14></a> What the Holy Ghost produces is always a want, though the want is met.<a name=233:15></a> Nicodemus owns Christ to be a teacher that comes from God; but he did not know that the old nature was good for nothing, and that he must be born again.<a name=233:16></a> Thus it is the Lord meets him: "I am not going to teach flesh: you must have a new nature; the old cannot be taught at all, except outwardly, and this is worthless.<a name=233:17></a>" The special case for a Jew is that he could not enter the earthly kingdom, except he were born again.<a name=233:18></a> Therefore the Lord says, "Marvel not that I said unto you, Ye must be born again.<a name=233:19></a>"

		If you take Luke as giving the order of the thing, Judas broke bread; having received the sop, he went immediately out.<a name=271:19></a> Luke says, after He had given both the bread and the cup, "the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table.<a name=271:20></a>" But here in John we have nothing to do with the Lord's supper; I merely get the fact that the sop was given to Judas.<a name=271:21></a> I think it has nothing to do with the Supper, whether Judas was there or not.<a name=271:22></a> Christ washed his feet, and there was intimacy at the table.<a name=271:23></a> It is important to notice that, because of the guilt resulting from it.<a name=271:24></a> If anybody quotes it as to fellowship now, then you would have betrayers at the table.<a name=271:25></a> Further there was no evil manifested, and you cannot of course put a man out where no evil is manifested.<a name=271:26></a> Besides, after all, people do not mean that they would have a table of Judases, and if you put it so to them, they will reject it.<a name=271:27></a> The Lord knew it Himself of course divinely, but that is no ground for us to act on and the disciples knew nothing of it, nor was their conscience exercised as to it; nor was the church founded till the Holy Ghost came.<a name=271:28></a>

		As to Judas you first get the lust, and then the acting on it; he was a thief and had the bag; and then comes an occasion suggested by Satan to gratify the lust, who thereon enters in and hardens the person's heart against even his natural feelings, for many an unconverted man would not betray a friend with a kiss.<a name=272:1></a> It is at this point when all this has come completely forward that you get "Now is the Son of man glorified," that is, in the cross the perfectness of His work was His glory, perfect devotedness and love were in it, and obedience at all cost to His Father, suffering all things where His glory called for it and it was a man's glory to make God's glory good and in such a place, "and God is glorified in him.<a name=272:2></a>" All that God is in His character is there made good by a man much more than a man no doubt, but one who was a man -- "God is glorified in him; if God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and will straightway glorify him.<a name=272:3></a>" He does not wait for the glory of the kingdom, but goes straight up to God's right hand.<a name=272:4></a> God thus is perfectly glorified by man, so that man goes into the glory of God.<a name=272:5></a> And that is an immense truth, for the fact of our sins being put away, if it stood alone, would not entitle us to the glory of God.<a name=272:6></a> But that which has done it has.<a name=272:7></a> But Christ has gone into the glory of God: so Stephen saw and said.<a name=272:8></a> But man could not follow before this was all done; you must have the ark in the bottom of Jordan, or the people could not come over.<a name=272:9></a> Peter had confidence in himself, and so he denies Christ.<a name=272:10></a> If we come in flesh into the place of Christ, it will only be to deny Him there.<a name=272:11></a>

		The "in himself" in verse 32 is in God, and Christ went straight into the glory of God.<a name=273:1></a> It is an immense part of the cross that, the ending of self and all confidence in self.<a name=273:2></a> The Lord told Peter he could not follow Him.<a name=273:3></a> And now the Lord in a certain sense assumes that He has gone out of the world, and He looks at things in that aspect, but their heart is not to be troubled at it; and in chapter 14 He gives them the ground on which it is not to be troubled.<a name=273:4></a> In the first place they get the comfort from God by believing in Him; and so would it be with Christ; and the next point is, in Christ's going away: it was not to leave them behind and He go alone, but He is going to prepare a place for them.<a name=273:5></a> It is not only a place for me, but there are a number of places, and I am going to prepare one for you, and "I will come again and receive you unto myself, that where I am there ye may be also.<a name=273:6></a>" Now that part of the chapter is complete in itself; they believe in Him instead of seeing Him; there are places in the Father's house and He is going to prepare us for them; He cannot stay with them where they are, but He will have them there with Himself.<a name=273:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now comes, in the body of the chapter, what the comfort is while He has not come back.<a name=273:8></a> That is divided into two parts; what they had in His person, and what they would get on having the Comforter.<a name=273:9></a> The first part extends to about the end of verse 15.<a name=273:10></a> The three or four verses about their doing greater works come in by the bye.<a name=273:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first part of the chapter is exceedingly beautiful and simple, when once you get at what the Lord is at.<a name=273:12></a> The point was "Whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.<a name=273:13></a>" Thomas answers, "Lord, we know not whither thou goest, and how can we know the way?<a name=273:14></a>" There was a good bit of unbelief in Thomas, his mind made difficulties, but he loved the Lord; and the Spirit delights to shew it (chapter 11: 16); and the answer is this, "I am going to the Father, and you know what He is, because you have seen the Father in me, and therefore you do know where I am going; and you know the way, because having come to Me, you have found Him.<a name=273:15></a>" Such is what the Lord says, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life, no man cometh unto the Father but by me: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also, and from henceforth ye know him and have seen him.<a name=273:16></a> Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father and it sufficeth us; Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip?<a name=273:17></a> He that hath seen me hath seen the Father, and how sayest thou then, shew us the Father?<a name=273:18></a>" and so on.<a name=273:19></a> If they had seen the Father (in seeing Christ) and Christ was going to the Father, they both knew where He was going, and they knew that He was the way, because in Him they had found the Father.<a name=273:20></a> They had had this upon earth, and they ought to have known where they were.<a name=273:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=274>[Page 274]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is "from henceforth" in verse 7, because He had revealed Himself and told them plainly now; but they did not understand.<a name=274:1></a> But they said, "now speakest thou plainly"; but they deceive themselves.<a name=274:2></a> He says, "I came forth from the Father, and come into the world, again, I leave the world and go to the Father"; they say, "by this we believe that thou camest forth from God.<a name=274:3></a>" They had no idea of the Father after all.<a name=274:4></a> Still there it was: they had it, though they did not realise it.<a name=274:5></a> Then you get the two things He has once or twice insisted upon, as in chapters 8 and 9, His word and His work, "Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father in me, or else believe me for the very works' sake.<a name=274:6></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in the second part (you may connect verse 15 with it if you like) "I will pray the Father, and he will give you another Comforter that he may abide with you for ever, even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not neither knoweth him, but ye know him for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.<a name=274:7></a>" Now I get a second element, not the Father and the Son, but the Spirit.<a name=274:8></a> The Father had been revealed in the Son, and He had declared the Father's name on earth; but now comes another thing, He was going away, as we know, and the second Comforter was to come.<a name=274:9></a> He was not to be sent into the world, the world cannot receive Him.<a name=274:10></a> Christ had been presented to the world, and the world would not have Him; but the Spirit is not for the world, the way that He is known shews that the world cannot know Him.<a name=274:11></a> He abides with you and shall be in you.<a name=274:12></a> The first Comforter, Christ, was neither to abide, nor to be "in.<a name=274:13></a>" But the second would not go away, He would abide, Christ could not abide.<a name=274:14></a> As to whether it should he "dwelleth" or "will dwell," in verse 17, for the Greek, or indeed for the sense, it is just as good in one case as the other; it is a mere question of a Greek accent.<a name=274:15></a> The "Comforter" is the character He would have in coming to them, He is the Spirit of truth as well.<a name=274:16></a> It is to me evidently the point, the difference of the first Comforter, that is, Christ, that He could not stay with them, and the second could.<a name=274:17></a> Christ was not in them either, but with them; the second should dwell in them, and abide for ever ("abide" is the same word as "dwell") not be merely with them.<a name=274:18></a> In the power of the Spirit of God they should do "greater works," and a glorified Christ should be the source of them.<a name=274:19></a> The very shadow of Peter would do; a handkerchief or apron from Paul, and so on; three thousand be converted in one day.<a name=274:20></a> But Christ had come in the character of humiliation.<a name=274:21></a>

		The "I will come to you" is Christ in Spirit now, I believe; Himself in Spirit.<a name=275:1></a> It is not merely the Holy Ghost, but what the believer can always count on.<a name=275:2></a> There is a particular promise in the case of two or three gathered in Christ's name.<a name=275:3></a> There is not only individually dwelling in our hearts by faith, but the particular way in which He comes to two or three gathered.<a name=275:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The "manifest myself to him," is where a person walks right; he gets Christ specially revealed to his heart.<a name=275:5></a> You have a very great additional fact in this second part of the chapter which you could not have in the first.<a name=275:6></a> What is in verse 20 that they could not have known then: "in that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you," it was only when the Holy Ghost came that they knew that.<a name=275:7></a> The person of Christ was in the Father, that they knew; at any rate it was there to be known; but also they were in Christ and He in them: this they could know only by the Holy Ghost.<a name=275:8></a> Now you come to Judas -- not Iscariot -- and the realisation of all this.<a name=275:9></a> We may look at verse 15 here; "if ye love me, keep my commandments," if you love me, do not be thinking of keeping Me down here, but do you obey Me.<a name=275:10></a> They were sorrowing about His going, and His words are; then, "keep my commandments.<a name=275:11></a>" There is a connection here (He is looking at them in the character of obedience, though it is not the motive of His praying in next verse) with Acts 5: 32, "and so is also the Holy Ghost whom God hath given to them that obey him.<a name=275:12></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The difference between "commandments" and "words" is that words go farther rather.<a name=275:13></a> In Acts 13: 47 you have a quotation from Isaiah, "for so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth.<a name=275:14></a>" He calls that a commandment, though it was a word of prophecy, but the moment they understood it, it was a commandment.<a name=275:15></a> The whole thing is comprised in obedience whether words or commandments, we are "sanctified to obedience.<a name=275:16></a>" If they had words which gave them the knowledge of God's will, they are commandments really.<a name=275:17></a>

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=276>[Page 276]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will find in all this part of John the responsibility of the disciples in the first place, and that, in the verse we have just come to.<a name=276:1></a> "He that hath my commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me; and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.<a name=276:2></a>" It is the Father loves us because we love Christ, it is not here, "we love him because he first loved us," but with disciples, it is "he that loveth me, shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him.<a name=276:3></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is no question here whether he is a child of the Father, but what he is to the Father as a child; there is more expression of love and kindness to an obedient child, than to a disobedient one.<a name=276:4></a> And He adds "if a man love me, he will keep my words, and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him and make our abode in him.<a name=276:5></a>" That goes farther, the "abode" will be more constant than the "manifestation.<a name=276:6></a>" "He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which you hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me.<a name=276:7></a>" Notice before in verse 21, it is not he that keepeth my commandments when he hath them; but knowing what the commandments of Christ are when we love Him so as to give heed to what He says.<a name=276:8></a> This is an important principle.<a name=276:9></a> A loving child enters into its father's mind, and knows what he would like and does it; a careless child will not know a bit what his father's wishes are.<a name=276:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In John 10: 17, "therefore doth my Father love me," etc.<a name=276:11></a>, it is not here so much for those for whom He is laying down His life, the motive is rather the immense value of glorifying His Father.<a name=276:12></a> Children that are living in their father's house, might all hear their father's voice and words, but there is instructive perception of what he intends on the part of the children that love him best.<a name=276:13></a> Which of us would settle quite clearly from Isaiah 49: "I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth," that we were to go and preach the grace of God?<a name=276:14></a> Paul did in Acts 13: 47.<a name=276:15></a> It is quite clear we must have the commandments if we are to use them, but the loving attentive person will have ten times more knowledge of them than a careless one.<a name=276:16></a> Mary and Martha are a kind of illustration; you get the example of the listening there or the lack of it.<a name=276:17></a>

		In this chapter the Father sends the Comforter, not Christ; Christ sends Him in the close of the next chapter, and in chapter 16: 7.<a name=277:1></a> It is in Christ's name here, but the Father sends Him, and "he shall bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.<a name=277:2></a>" The value of sending in His name is seen in this.<a name=277:3></a> If you come to me in a person's name now, I should receive according to the value to me of the person in whose name you come.<a name=277:4></a> Then He says, "Peace I leave with you," and then it is "his own peace.<a name=277:5></a>" You will find that as to everything.<a name=277:6></a> He puts us into His own place.<a name=277:7></a> It is His own peace, the peace He had in walking through this world with the Father, as a man with God.<a name=277:8></a> Christ says it of "joy," "glory," "peace," "words," "love.<a name=277:9></a>" The world may give liberally sometimes, but it has another kind and way of giving.<a name=277:10></a> It has no longer what it has given.<a name=277:11></a> The emphasis is on the word "my," "my joy," "the glory thou gavest me," "the words which thou gavest me.<a name=277:12></a>" But we find another thing here which I have often referred to, but it is one of the most wonderful things in Scripture as to Christ.<a name=277:13></a> He expects us to be interested in His happiness, not merely to trust Him as interested in ourselves; but "if ye loved me, ye would rejoice because I said, I go unto the Father, for my Father is greater than I.<a name=277:14></a>" That is, if you love Me, you will rejoice because I am going out of this world into happiness.<a name=277:15></a> He expects that His disciples should be really interested in His happiness and glory.<a name=277:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then we come to verse 30, "hereafter I will not talk much with you, for the prince of this world cometh and hath nothing in me.<a name=277:17></a>" "Prince of this world" is an important expression; it was then that the devil was proved to be the prince of this world, and he is never called so until Christ was rejected, so long as there was a possibility remaining of the world receiving the Son and owning Him; but in the rejection of Christ, the devil was able to raise both Jews and Gentiles against Christ Himself, and even the disciples ran away.<a name=277:18></a> His full power was shewn.<a name=277:19></a> And therefore too now, the devil is a judged being -- "the prince of this world is judged" -- and the world shewn to be under Satan's power.<a name=277:20></a> He its god and its prince.<a name=277:21></a> The opposite is in Christ, "has nothing in me.<a name=277:22></a>" And Christ loves the Father, and is obedient (verse 31).<a name=277:23></a>

		In chapter 15 it is His relationship with the disciples on earth, and in the end of the chapter He has gone up on high, and sends the Comforter Himself, and it closes with the testimony.<a name=278:9></a> In chapter 16 it is the Comforter down here; He is not sent but come, He has been sent.<a name=278:10></a> In chapter 15 you get Christ in the earth, and His people on the earth.<a name=278:11></a> There is an analogy to this now, but what He is looking at is His being the real vine Himself in contrast with Israel on earth.<a name=278:12></a>

		"Now ye are clean" is "already ye are clean.<a name=278:13></a>" The "ye are not all clean" in chapter 13 refers to Judas, here there is no exception for it, Judas had gone out.<a name=278:14></a> The point is, Israel was the old vine, and Christ takes the place of Israel, and is the true vine.<a name=278:15></a> If you look at Isaiah 49, you will see distinctly how he replaces the nation "Thou art my servant, O Israel, in whom I will be glorified.<a name=278:16></a>" "And now, saith Jehovah that formed me from the womb to be his servant, to bring Jacob again to him, though Israel be not gathered," and so on.<a name=278:17></a> Thus it is Christ is the real servant -- Israel a vine, but Christ the true vine.<a name=278:18></a> So you get in Matthew, "Out of Egypt have I called my Son.<a name=278:19></a>" Hence Christ is the true Man for God -- the true Servant -- the true Vine.<a name=278:20></a> The true Man, God's Son, has taken up all that in which the first man had failed.<a name=278:21></a> Then, when Christ was upon earth, there was no church union; there is no question of planting vines in heaven nor of pruning to get fruit.<a name=278:22></a> He says, "Every branch in me that beareth fruit, he purgeth it"; and in verse 3, "Now ye are already purged"; it is the same word.<a name=278:23></a> They were clean in the sense of "purged," only that the purging continues; like "He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet"; this is the first of these washings.<a name=278:24></a> "Ye are already clean"; you are "already.<a name=278:25></a>" And then comes, "abide in me.<a name=278:26></a>" It is all responsibility here.<a name=278:27></a> The person's conduct is put first, but there is this difference made, when He speaks of ruin and destruction; He turns from "you" and says "a man.<a name=278:28></a>" In the middle of His exhortation He drops the "ye" and says, "If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them and cast them into the fire, and they are burned"; there it is positive destruction.<a name=278:29></a>

		You get the three names we were speaking of brought together in Corinthians: "Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord [that is, Jehovah] -- Almighty.<a name=289:1></a>" Almighty, Jehovah, and Father.<a name=289:2></a> Abraham's God Almighty, Israel's Jehovah, Father is God's name with us.<a name=289:3></a> Most High will be millennial.<a name=289:4></a> Father comes out in John 17.<a name=289:5></a> Almighty did not give eternal life, but kept Abraham from one people to another; and Jehovah was faithful to His promises, making them all good to His people.<a name=289:6></a> But this did not give eternal life, nor is it eternal life; but the moment the Father sends the Son, here is the grace that gives eternal life.<a name=289:7></a> God sent His only begotten Son that we might live through Him.<a name=289:8></a> We do not live through the first Adam.<a name=289:9></a> The Almighty watched over Abraham, but that did not give life, nor yet the government of Jehovah, but the name of the Father sending the Son does, and, receiving Him, we get it; that is eternal life.<a name=289:10></a> The Most High goes on to the millennium, and we have not come to that yet.<a name=289:11></a> "Father" is the special name that we have; it was revealed while Christ was upon earth, but not understood, because they had not yet the Spirit of adoption.<a name=289:12></a> Then comes the position we get this in; that the Father glorifies the Son, all power being given to Him to give eternal life to as many as God gave Him; and that eternal life was in the knowledge of the Father, the true God, and of Jesus Christ as sent.<a name=289:13></a>

		Then comes another point.<a name=290:1></a> His work: "I have glorified thee on earth; I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do, and now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.<a name=290:2></a>" He had glorified God down here, and finished the work given Him to do.<a name=290:3></a> It is wonderful how the work itself is all passed over, but it is finished and He is looking at the one passing out of the world to the Father; and that is what has made the difficulty of understanding the seeing Him again, for He did not actually go to the Father till the forty days were ended: the work is finished, and then He goes back as Man into the glory of the Father.<a name=290:4></a> And then it is He makes us sons, glorifying God by His work, and we have part in the effect of it as sons.<a name=290:5></a> So you get the whole framework of grace in this chapter.<a name=290:6></a> He takes the glory as man having accomplished the work.<a name=290:7></a> "Glorify thou me with thine own self.<a name=290:8></a>" "With" means "with Himself, along with Himself.<a name=290:9></a>" He has just the same glory as the Father, but He never goes of Himself out of the place of humiliation.<a name=290:10></a> He was with the Father before the world was -- one with the Father.<a name=290:11></a> You get that equality all through the Gospel.<a name=290:12></a> So here, "I have glorified thee," now "glorify thou me"; but He never says, "I have glorified thee, and now I will glorify myself.<a name=290:13></a>" He receives everything, and will take everything as receiving it from the Father.<a name=290:14></a>

		As to Isaiah 53: 11, "By his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many," the meaning is very different.<a name=290:15></a> Christ does not justify us by His knowledge.<a name=290:16></a> The Hebrew word has two meanings.<a name=290:17></a> It is to justify; but it is also to "instruct in righteousness," though it goes farther, for He might instruct, and they not learn.<a name=290:18></a> But the meaning is they are really instructed.<a name=290:19></a> To justify by knowledge is very crooked.<a name=290:20></a> "It pleased the Lord to bruise him, he hath put him to grief; when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand; he shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied; by his knowledge shall my righteous servant instruct the many in righteousness, and he shall bear their iniquities.<a name=290:21></a>" It is "instruct the many," but in the last verse it is "bare the sin of many," without "the"; there is a "the," or article, when it says, instruct the many in righteousness.<a name=290:22></a><a href="#290:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>

		Notice now verses 4, 5.<a name=291:1></a> Christ receives as Man, what He had been in as a divine Person before ever the world was at all, and then you come to the next step, to bring out the part of those who were given Him.<a name=291:2></a> "I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world.<a name=291:3></a>" It is the Father giving to Him as Son of man, and He gets the whole place as receiving it of the Father, and having finished the work, He brings us into it, and then He manifests the Father's name to bring us into relationship in which He is as Son.<a name=291:4></a> He has communicated to them all the communications of the Father to Him as Man down here, so that they should enjoy the relationship as exercised in these communications.<a name=291:5></a> "I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me, and they have received them, and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.<a name=291:6></a>" Thus we get their place settled.<a name=291:7></a> First, He manifests the name; and next, whatever the Father had given Him He passes on to them that they may have the full enjoyment of it.<a name=291:8></a>

		Then He prays and first for the eleven; further on He says, "I pray not for these only" -- all Christians are the gift of the Father to Christ; though the immediate application is to those brought in by the apostles.<a name=293:1></a> "I pray not for the world" stands in a way contrasted with Psalm 2.<a name=293:2></a> He leaves the world and does not pray for it.<a name=293:3></a> Intercession is only for those who actually believe.<a name=293:4></a> "I pray for them; I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me.<a name=293:5></a>" He will ask for the world hereafter, but He does not occupy Himself with it here.<a name=293:6></a> It is in this verse that He begins to pray.<a name=293:7></a> "Glorify me" in verse 5 is not prayer.<a name=293:8></a> "And all mine are thine and thine are mine.<a name=293:9></a>" It is precious to see these two motives given to the Father to keep us.<a name=293:10></a> If thou carest for Thine own thou must keep them, and if thou carest for My glory thou must keep them, for He adds, "and I am glorified in them.<a name=293:11></a>" This gives two motives for keeping them, they belong to the Father and Christ is glorified in them.<a name=293:12></a> "And now I am no more in the world; but these are in the world, and I come to thee.<a name=293:13></a>" There is His position taken.<a name=293:14></a> "Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are.<a name=293:15></a>" As yet we have only got the disciples -- the apostles.<a name=293:16></a> "While I was with them in the world I kept them in thy name, those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost.<a name=293:17></a>" We get the name withal in which they are kept.<a name=293:18></a> Kept as by a Father, but as a holy Father, there is all the love and care of their being His own children, but the holiness of God's nature is the character in which He keeps them.<a name=293:19></a>

		And now I have another thing to mark, and that is the three unities.<a name=293:20></a> First, it is the apostles "that they may be one as we are," and then the next is that they all may be one, as thou Father art in me and I in thee, that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou hast sent me," and that is for the others who believe through their words -- communion as 1 John 1.<a name=293:21></a> And then there is a third, "And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them, that they may be one even as we are one.<a name=293:22></a> I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one, and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them as thou hast loved me.<a name=293:23></a>" That is the glory.<a name=293:24></a> Display of the Father in the Son and of the Son in the saints.<a name=293:25></a>

		The unity of the apostles was unity by the power of thought and work of the Holy Ghost.<a name=294:1></a> They were identical in counsels and purposes, being entirely under the Holy Ghost, they were all of one mind, and it was one thing.<a name=294:2></a> Then when the persons who had believed were brought in, they are brought into communion with the Father and the Son which the apostles enjoyed that they might be "one in us" as is said, may have communion with us, and our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.<a name=294:3></a> The apostles brought such into fellowship with them, and they then had communion with "us.<a name=294:4></a>" Those who believed were brought into unity and communion, though they did not go out in action and counsel; but they are brought in to enjoy it in the Father and Son, and have fellowship with them.<a name=294:5></a> That would be the same as in John's first Epistle.<a name=294:6></a> It is unity of communion, not of divine action and counsel, and work.<a name=294:7></a> The third unity is simple; for there you have the glory, and you get what is descendible, so to speak, "I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one, and that the world may know that thou hast sent me.<a name=294:8></a>"

		The first is divine action and counsel and everything, referring to the twelve; the second refers to those who believe through their word, the Holy Ghost working by them, and these brought into communion, and all one that the world may believe; and then the unity in the glory, the glory given that they may be one even as we are one.<a name=294:9></a> The Father, glorified in Christ, and Christ glorified in us, and this glory He gives us that the world may know; for when they come out in glory the world will not "believe," but will "know" that God sent Christ, and, wondrous word!<a name=294:10></a> loved us as He loved Him, for they will see them in the same glory together.<a name=294:11></a> It is three steps, the giving out of the testimony by the apostles; the reception of the testimony through their means in the beginning; and the glory.<a name=294:12></a> The last is the same as in Thessalonians.<a name=294:13></a> "I am glorified in them" is also now, but He will be perfectly glorified in His saints.<a name=294:14></a> You get a picture of it in the Acts too.<a name=294:15></a> Well these are the three unities.<a name=294:16></a> "And now come I to thee, and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.<a name=294:17></a>" There you have them put in His own place with the Father "my joy"; nothing less.<a name=294:18></a>

		And now He puts them in His own place, not with the Father, but in respect of the world; "I have given them thy word, and the world hath hated them.<a name=295:5></a>" It is in the same place of testimony that He had been in.<a name=295:6></a> They are in the same place as Himself with the Father to the end of verse 13; and then He begins to put them in the same place as to the world, and He prays, "not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.<a name=295:7></a>" There I learn that He has made their place that which His was, giving them His testimony, the Father's word, not words here, and the world will not bear it; if you get into this place the world will not stand it.<a name=295:8></a> The world will bear a deal of religion, but not the Father.<a name=295:9></a> The Father dwells with the Christian; you are all outside, if you belong to the world and not to the Father.<a name=295:10></a> The Father has taken His Son up to Himself out of the world; and the Son says, "O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee, but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.<a name=295:11></a>" "I have manifested thy name" and the effect is that I am rejected.<a name=295:12></a> The world has not known the Father, but the Father takes up the Son to His right hand, and the world is all left behind; but Christians are put in His place before the Father and before the world.<a name=295:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"Holy Father" is the name He uses in verse 11, where He asks for them to be kept; here it is "righteous Father" in speaking of the world.<a name=295:14></a> It is God, of course, but the friendship of the world is enmity against God, and God is righteous in reference to it.<a name=295:15></a> In verse 16 He says, "they are not of the world even as I am not of the world," and then goes on to how they are practically made not of the world as Christ was not of it.<a name=295:16></a> The Father's truth, and the Son at the right hand of God, these are the two great elements.<a name=295:17></a> "Sanctify them through thy truth, thy word is truth.<a name=295:18></a>" I want them apart from the evil, they are not of it, as I am not of it; thy word, the divine word, is truth, truth to separate them from it.<a name=295:19></a> And then "for their sakes I sanctify myself that they also might be sanctified through the truth.<a name=295:20></a>" It is not only the Father's truth brought down by the Spirit so as to bring what is in His mind into ours and form us by it judging the evil; but Christ has set Himself apart as the One in whom all this truth is realised in glory, and as the object of their affections, so that they should be sanctified through the truth.<a name=295:21></a> Just as He had said before, "the truth shall make you free," and "the Son shall make you free.<a name=295:22></a>" This is an important sentence; it is the way in which you are morally put in the place in which we are detached from the world.<a name=295:23></a> The truth shews us the divine nature, Christ, His death; it is the Father's word that comes from Christ who is gone on high, and it is with the additional fact that in Christ Himself it is all realised in glory.<a name=295:24></a> We have had now their place with the Father, their place in the world.<a name=295:25></a>

		But there is another thing which gives an intimation about it, and that is, when the Lord sends them forth, He tells them (Matthew 10) "If they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another; for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel till the Son of man be come.<a name=312:1></a>" But in Acts you find that, on persecution arising, they all <i>fled, except</i> the apostles, and that must be taken into account as to the way in which the instruction was practically carried out.<a name=312:2></a> For the Gentiles there is an entirely fresh start from Antioch when Paul is sent out by the Holy Ghost.<a name=312:3></a> There was then very nearly a split between Jerusalem and Antioch, but they were united and kept together as you find in Acts 15.<a name=312:4></a>

		Well, the mission in Matthew starts from Christ's connection with the remnant in Israel.<a name=312:5></a> In Mark, it is more general.<a name=312:6></a> You get more the service of Christ there; and in chapter 16: 15, He said unto them, "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature"; that is the largest and most general commission you have, "He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, but he that believeth not shall be damned.<a name=312:7></a>" It is the more remarkable because that is the part of Mark which the learned Germans reject from verse 9 to the end.<a name=312:8></a> In what precedes you get this Galilee revelation <i>of</i> Himself, but no heavenly revelation, no Bethany revelation at all.<a name=312:9></a> In what they consider genuine in Mark you do not get the ascension; they only go to the instruction in verse 7, and stop with "They were afraid" (verse 8).<a name=312:10></a> But in Mark they are sent to Galilee, and the history is pursued regularly on that basis up to the end of verse 8, but if you stop at verse 8, it stops all of a heap, and you get no mission at all.<a name=312:11></a> In these last verses you get His appearings to them, and the facts are what are recounted in Luke and John, and the mission is added in verse 15; it is not said in what connection, and then He is received up into heaven.<a name=312:12></a> They go forth, the Lord working with them, so that there you get the mission from heaven with power.<a name=312:13></a> It is the Luke commission from verse 9.<a name=312:14></a> In Luke you only get the last part of Mark, who gives Matthew up to the sepulchre, and parts of Luke and John.<a name=312:15></a> In Luke 24 "It behoved Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day, and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.<a name=312:16></a>" He, taking the mission from heaven as Paul did, takes in Jerusalem as much as the nations, "the Jew first, and also the Greek.<a name=312:17></a>" Then "He led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lift up his hands and blessed them; and it came to pass while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.<a name=312:18></a>" So Luke's mission practically comes from heaven, it is in Bethany and not in Galilee.<a name=312:19></a> Galilee is the mission to Gentiles only from a risen Saviour in the place where He had the poor of the flock; Luke's commission is from heaven, and is Pauline in character.<a name=312:20></a> In Mark you have "Go to Galilee," but you have no Galilee mission at all.<a name=312:21></a> In John you get no going to heaven, but you get them sent out for the remission of sins: "As my Father hath sent me, even so send I you.<a name=312:22></a>" It is a mission from the divine person, not from a place at all.<a name=312:23></a> And then it is by the Holy Ghost: He gives them the Holy Ghost and the forgiveness of sins; and so there is no ascension in John, for this would give a place, though a heavenly one.<a name=312:24></a>

		Then Simon Peter comes, and the Lord takes him and tests him as to his fall.<a name=315:15></a> "Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these?<a name=315:16></a>" That is what he pretended to do.<a name=315:17></a> "He saith unto him, Yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love [am attached to] thee.<a name=315:18></a> He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.<a name=315:19></a>" He asks a second time, and Simon replies the same, but the Lord changes the words then into "Feed my sheep," or properly, "Shepherd my sheep," not "feed.<a name=315:20></a>" It is one of the defects of the English translation, that they have put the same word where the original has different ones, and different words where the original has the same.<a name=315:21></a> Then the third time, instead of using the same Greek word for "<i>lovest</i>," as in the first two questions, the Lord changes the word, and uses the same word <i>[phileo]</i> that Peter had used in his two answers.<a name=315:22></a> He took Peter up as it were on his own expression, and asks him, "Art thou attached to me "; Peter answers, "Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love [am attached to] thee.<a name=315:23></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord never reproaches Peter for the fault, but He probes him -- probes the root that produced it; and when He has thoroughly humbled him so that he is obliged to appeal to divine knowledge that he did love, then He commits all that is dearest to Himself to Peter.<a name=315:24></a> He had said to him before (Luke 22) that He had prayed for him, "that thy faith fail not, and when thou art converted [brought back], strengthen thy brethren.<a name=315:25></a> And he saith unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison and to death.<a name=315:26></a> And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day before thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me"; and now, when Peter is broken down and the flesh proved, can He say, as it were, "you are fit to serve.<a name=315:27></a>" You see how He takes that up, "when thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself and walkedst whither thou wouldest," there is human will; "but when thou shalt be old thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.<a name=315:28></a> This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God.<a name=315:29></a> And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.<a name=315:30></a>" That is exactly what Peter had pretended to do; he had said, "I will follow thee to prison and death.<a name=315:31></a>" Now He says, Of your own will you cannot.<a name=315:32></a> It is a beautiful expression of the Lord's love and a pattern of the Lord's restoring grace.<a name=315:33></a>

		Everyone has to go through that, though you see many a person serving sincerely who has not been broken down yet.<a name=316:1></a> Yet I believe it must be got; if one does go and make messes, he gets it afterwards.<a name=316:2></a> There is a positive breaking down of flesh, and then when you know it can do nothing but mischief, which is all it can do, there is still the watching of it after its back is broken, so to speak.<a name=316:3></a> Peter's mission to the circumcision comes to nothing in the outward sense, and he follows Christ.<a name=316:4></a> As to outward work for the Jews, Christ's mission had come to nothing, and so had Peter's: Jerusalem was taken, the Jews were rejected, and the church as Peter had it was altogether nothing, being supplanted, as you may say, by Paul's.<a name=316:5></a> So with Paul himself, when Jesus spoke to him, and he fell to the earth, he asks, "Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?<a name=316:6></a>" Before, in his own energy, he had had no hesitation what to do, and went very vigorously about it.<a name=316:7></a> And afterwards he was away for three years to learn, though he was first allowed to give a full testimony at Damascus; "And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God.<a name=316:8></a>" In that way Moses needed to have forty years in the desert before leading out the people.<a name=316:9></a>

		MEDITATIONS ON THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		INTRODUCTION
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Acts of the Apostles are a continuation of the Gospel of Luke, and are written by the same Evangelist.<a name=319:1></a> The discourses, whether of Peter or of Paul, have their source in the heavenly commission which is found at the end of that Gospel.<a name=319:2></a> It is not necessary, I hope, to say that the whole is given by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, because each of the evangelists has been employed by God to present us with a different aspect of the history of the Lord; and each has accomplished, with the help of the Spirit, the work assigned to him by God.<a name=319:3></a> For example, in Matthew we find much more the dispensations of God, and the Lord as Emmanuel in the midst of Israel on the earth.<a name=319:4></a> In Luke, after the first two chapters, we have the Son of man, and the ways of God in grace and the blessings of the present time.<a name=319:5></a> Then again, in Matthew, the ascension of the Lord is not recounted, and the commission given to the apostles comes from a risen Jesus, and is addressed to the Gentiles as though the residue of the Jews were already received in grace.<a name=319:6></a> The Lord, in Luke, is about to ascend into heaven, and goes there while speaking to them, blessing them with a heavenly blessing; and the commission is addressed to all -- first to the Jews, then to the Gentiles.<a name=319:7></a> The disciples were to begin in Jerusalem; and this work -- the accomplishment of their mission -- is what is found recounted in Acts.<a name=319:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us follow the course of this story, which is essentially the history of the activity of the apostles Peter and Paul: the first among the Jews, and in the foundation of the church at Jerusalem; and the other among the Gentiles, although he always addressed himself first to the Jews.<a name=319:9></a> The first was one of His eleven disciples who had followed the Lord on the earth, till the cloud received Him and took Him from their sight.<a name=319:10></a> The last, Paul, an open enemy to the name of Christ, and converted in sovereign grace while he was occupied in the destruction, if possible, of that name, only saw Him in the glory, and went out to call the Gentiles to the faith: marvellous witness of the sovereign grace of God, and of a glory which renders a magnificent testimony to the perfect and accepted work of Christ, to which believers are led by faith in Him and in His work.<a name=319:11></a> Both these two great apostles laid the same foundation of the salvation preached, that there is but one Saviour and one work by which we may be saved.<a name=319:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=320>[Page 320]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the grand and important fact, on which all the history depends, is the descent of the Holy Spirit.<a name=320:1></a> Doubtless, in all Biblical history, the responsibility of man is found, as well as the ways of God, through the deeds and weakness of man; but nevertheless the presence of the Holy Spirit on the earth, sent by the Father and by the Son of man, and dwelling in the faithful and in the house of God, is of immense importance.<a name=320:2></a> It is only when God has accomplished redemption that He comes to dwell in the midst of men.<a name=320:3></a> He did not dwell with Adam in his innocence, nor with Abraham, nor with any, till He had brought Israel out of Egypt, and had rescued them from the hands of the king of Egypt, in whose hands they were prisoners; then He came to dwell in their midst in the cloud, and the tabernacle was filled with His glory.<a name=320:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus, as soon as the Son of man is gone into heaven to sit down at the right hand of God, having accomplished the work of redemption, the Holy Spirit descends according to His promise of the Comforter, and the baptism of the Spirit is realised.<a name=320:5></a> Sent from the Father, He cries, "Abba, Father," in the hearts of those who have received Him.<a name=320:6></a> Sent by the Son from the Father, He reveals the glory of Him, the man in heaven; and, more than that, forms the body of Christ joining the members to the head, so that he "that is joined to the Lord is one spirit," dwelling in the believer, and also in the universal congregation of believers, so that they are together the habitation of God.<a name=320:7></a> It is evident that this truth is of immense importance; the spiritual liberty given to the child of God, the unity of the assembly of God, and the union of the children of God, all depend on the presence of the Spirit, as all are founded on the work of the Saviour on the cross.<a name=320:8></a> Then this truth reveals the state of the external church where He dwells, because she has grieved the Spirit, and has been -- and has acted -- in a manner altogether contrary to what He would have her be and do, so much so that the judgment of God is ready to fall upon her.<a name=320:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Since I have spoken of the descent of the Holy Spirit, it must be understood that the "new birth" is not the point here (though that may be accomplished by the same Spirit), but rather the personal coming of the Spirit, when the Son of man ascended into heaven.<a name=320:10></a> The Holy Spirit has worked divinely since the foundation of the world.<a name=320:11></a> He it was who moved upon the face of the waters, who inspired the prophets, who has been the immediate instrument of all that God has done on the earth and in the heavens.<a name=320:12></a> But He only came here below when the Son of man went to sit down at the right hand of God (John 7: 37-39), and is only received when we believe (Ephesians 1: 13; Galatians 4: 6).<a name=320:13></a> This is seen also clearly elsewhere: we are sealed when we have believed, and especially when we have believed in the value of the blood of Christ.<a name=320:14></a> Washed in this precious blood, we are fit to be the habitation of the Spirit of God.<a name=320:15></a> "Know ye not," says the apostle Paul, "that your bodies are the temple of the Holy Spirit which ye have from God?<a name=320:16></a>" As when the leper was cleansed and purified under the law, he was first washed with water, then sprinkled with blood, then anointed with oil (Leviticus 14: 8, 9, and 14-18) -- clear figure of our purification by means of the word of God when we are converted and born again, then of the sprinkling of the blood of Christ, and finally of the anointing of the Holy Spirit by which we are sealed for the day of final redemption.<a name=320:17></a>

		Also all gifts, the exercise of which is found in the church, are the manifestation of the Holy Spirit who works there.<a name=321:1></a> But here, in the Acts, the exposition of the operations of the Spirit is not found, but the fact itself of His coming in order to work.<a name=321:2></a>

		CHAPTER 1
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us now come to the examination of the narrative itself.<a name=321:3></a> This begins with the great truth of which we have already spoken.<a name=321:4></a> The disciples were to wait at Jerusalem for the baptism of the Holy Ghost.<a name=321:5></a> We shall find again the proof of another precious truth.<a name=321:6></a> The Lord, after His resurrection, gave commissions to His disciples by the Holy Ghost.<a name=321:7></a> We shall not lose the Holy Ghost when we are raised again: truth perhaps simple, but which makes us feel how great will be our capacity for happiness in that state.<a name=321:8></a> Now a great portion of our spiritual strength is employed to enable us to walk in integrity, in spite of the flesh and the temptations of the enemy; but then neither the one nor the other will exist.<a name=321:9></a> All the power of the Spirit in us will be employed in rendering us fit for the infinite felicity we shall find there.<a name=321:10></a> We shall enjoy it according to the strength of the Spirit, as Christ gave gifts by the Spirit to His disciples after His resurrection.<a name=321:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Remark now the intimacy of the Lord with His disciples.<a name=322:1></a> He spoke of the things belonging to the kingdom of God.<a name=322:2></a> Christ is now glorified, but His heart, full of divine love, is not removed, is not any the farther away from His own.<a name=322:3></a> When He appeared to Saul, He said, "I am Jesus of Nazareth whom thou persecutest.<a name=322:4></a>" He speaks to Ananias with authority it is true, but as with a friend, opening His heart respecting Saul, and sending Ananias to speak to him.<a name=322:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He was not ashamed to call His disciples friends on the earth; He is not ashamed to treat them as friends now.<a name=322:6></a> Immense blessing!<a name=322:7></a> To feel that the Lord of glory is near to us, that He holds us as friends and loved ones, and that He can feel compassion also for our infirmities.<a name=322:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The disciples expected still the visible kingdom of the Lord in Israel; their hearts were still Jewish.<a name=322:9></a> They quite believed that He had risen again, but expected that their hopes of the restoration of Israel as a nation would be realised by the Lord, now that He had come out of the sepulchre.<a name=322:10></a> The Lord did not tell them that the kingdom would not be restored to Israel; but that it did not concern them to know the times and seasons which the Father had put in His own power.<a name=322:11></a> The kingdom shall be restored to Israel -- when is not revealed.<a name=322:12></a> The Son of man will come in an hour when He is not expected.<a name=322:13></a> He sits at the right hand of God the Father till His enemies shall be made His footstool.<a name=322:14></a> In the meantime He gathers His co-heirs, those who are content to suffer with Him; and caught up into glory we shall reign with Him.<a name=322:15></a> It is not revealed then, it was not revealed to the disciples -- the hour of the Saviour's return; but they should receive, said the Lord, not many days hence, the power of the Holy Ghost, which should come on them, and they should be witnesses to Him in Jerusalem, in Judaea, in Samaria, and to the uttermost parts of the earth.<a name=322:16></a> And, having said these things, He was taken up, while they beheld, and a cloud received Him and took Him away out of their sight.<a name=322:17></a> They were to be eyewitnesses as far as this point of His heavenly glory.<a name=322:18></a> The Holy Ghost was sent after Him (see John 15: 26, 27).<a name=322:19></a> We shall find later that Saul saw Him in His heavenly glory for the first time, of which thing he was to be the special witness.<a name=322:20></a> How the Holy Ghost has rendered clear testimony to this glory, we shall see in the discourses in the Acts; and again it may be seen in the epistles of Peter and elsewhere.<a name=322:21></a>

		<a name=323>[Page 323]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But here is found, before the coming of the Holy Ghost, a very remarkable testimony rendered by means of angels.<a name=323:1></a> The disciples had their eyes fixed on the heavens while Jesus was going there.<a name=323:2></a> This was very natural.<a name=323:3></a> The beloved Saviour, given back to them from the grave, was, apparently at least, abandoning them again -- for heaven, it is true, which ought to have strengthened their faith.<a name=323:4></a> He had left a promise of the power of the Spirit, which, however, had not yet come; and therefore the consciousness and direction of this power, which was to reveal all the truth, was wanting to them.<a name=323:5></a> He had gone away, and what should they do?<a name=323:6></a> They must wait.<a name=323:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And as their eyes were then fixed on the heavens, behold, two by appearance men, but in reality angels, stood beside them, asking why they looked up into heaven, and making them the revelation of His return.<a name=323:8></a> A fact very remarkable, since the Lord had, after the Lord's supper, made known to the disciples that He was going to the Father; and the first consolation He gave His disciples was that He would come again and take them to Himself in the Father's house, where He was going to prepare them a place; then He speaks of the presence of the Comforter which was to be accomplished.<a name=323:9></a> There He speaks of His coming to introduce His own into the Father's house; here, of His glorious appearing, when He will make Himself seen from the place where He has gone.<a name=323:10></a> There He Himself speaks of the special privilege of His own according to His personal affection which He had for them.<a name=323:11></a> He wished to console them, His heart had need of them; He desired to have them near to Himself, in the same glory, so that they might see His glory, but especially that, where He was, there they might be also.<a name=323:12></a> Here it is His return in glory, which would be like His going away.<a name=323:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This was the disciples' first consolation, once they were deprived of His presence.<a name=323:14></a> Then another Comforter would be given to dwell with them meanwhile here below.<a name=323:15></a> But whether in the declaration on the part of the Lord in His love, or in the revelation made by the angels, the first thing in the Saviour's heart and in the revelations of God is that He will come again.<a name=323:16></a> Immense is the gift of the Spirit during His absence, and for ever immense is the nature of the state in which redemption has placed the assembly of God here below: but its hope is, and the height of its joy will be, to see the Saviour as He is, to be always with Him, like Him, to see and to be for ever with Him who does love us and has washed us from our sins in His own blood, and to see Him face to face!<a name=323:17></a> Greatest blessing, too great for us, if not the fruit of something still greater -- the cross and the sufferings of the Son of God.<a name=323:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Once this blessed Saviour has suffered, and the Son of God has been made sin for us, and has died as a man on the cross, nothing is too great; it will only be the fruit of the travail of His soul.<a name=324:1></a> He shall be satisfied; His love shall be satisfied in our happiness and in our presence with Him.<a name=324:2></a> Look only at Zephaniah 3: 17, where the love and the glory are inferior to this: "Jehovah thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love; he will joy over thee with singing.<a name=324:3></a>" The Father will rest in His love, and in the accomplishment of all His counsels for the glory of His Son; shewing, at the same time, in the ages to come, the excellency of the riches of His grace in kindness towards us in Christ Jesus.<a name=324:4></a> Such is our expectation.<a name=324:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The disciples return to Jerusalem, and live there together in an upper chamber.<a name=324:6></a> They persevered with one consent in supplication and prayer, with the women and with Mary, the mother of Jesus, and His brethren.<a name=324:7></a> But the effect of the promise of the Father is only found in chapter 2.<a name=324:8></a> All that we have at the end of chapter 1 is connected with a Jewish situation; that is, with the condition of the disciples before the coming of the Spirit, yet possessing an understanding which had been opened by the Lord to understand the word.<a name=324:9></a> They had not the power of the Spirit, but intelligence of the word; because their standing was in relation with Christ raised up from the dead, they were enlightened by the divine light communicated to them after His resurrection.<a name=324:10></a> These verses accord perfectly with verses 14-48 of Luke 24.<a name=324:11></a> Then comes the promise of the Spirit, the accomplishment of which is found in chapter 2.<a name=324:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The well-known active energy of Peter employs the knowledge given by the Lord, applying Psalm 109 to Judas, whose office, says the psalm, another should take.<a name=324:13></a> They drew lots, according to Jewish custom, leaving the decision in the hands of God.<a name=324:14></a> Matthias is chosen and added to the eleven apostles.<a name=324:15></a> Verses 18, 19 are a parenthesis.<a name=324:16></a> The sabbath-day's journey, the lots, and all the circumstances, shew clearly the actual state of the disciples and the thought of the Holy Ghost on this step.<a name=324:17></a> They work with intelligence of the word of the Old Testament; but the Spirit had not yet come.<a name=324:18></a> It is important for us to understand the difference.<a name=324:19></a> The Spirit gives now intelligence (1 Corinthians 2: 14); but this is not of itself power.<a name=324:20></a>

		But the great event of which we have spoken now claims our attention -- the immense fact of the coming of the Holy Ghost to dwell with the disciples of Jesus, in each, and in the midst of all together.<a name=325:7></a> Thus, in 1 Corinthians 3: 16, the church as a universal assembly is the temple of God; and then, in 1 Corinthians 6: 19, the body of the faithful is the temple of God.<a name=325:8></a> All those who, steadfast in Jesus, habitually gathered together were thus assembled on the day of Pentecost.<a name=325:9></a> We have seen (chapter 1: 14), that they continued with one accord in prayer while waiting for the Comforter, promised according to the word of Jesus.<a name=325:10></a>

		But, besides this, a marvellous testimony is found in this fact to the grace of God.<a name=326:1></a> The presence of the Holy Ghost depended on the sitting of the Man Jesus at the right hand of God; demonstration and fruit of the accomplishment of the work of redemption.<a name=326:2></a> Now this could not be limited to the Jewish people.<a name=326:3></a> This presence was in itself a testimony to that accomplishment, and the earnest of our inheritance, Christ being dead for all, and ascending into glory.<a name=326:4></a> For the moment, the patience of God fulfilled the work of grace among the Jews, people of the promises; but the gospel which should be preached was for the whole world.<a name=326:5></a>

		In the meantime He gathers together the heirs of Christ, the heavenly assembly.<a name=326:9></a> Thus -- although for a moment the Spirit had separated in the midst of the Jews, spared as a nation by the intercession of Christ on the cross, till they should have rejected a glorified Christ in the same way that they had a crucified Christ come in humiliation: and also to gather together all those among this people that had ears to hear -- it is shewn by the Spirit how the God of grace was ready to overstep the limits of the chosen people and surmount the judgment of Babel, speaking to all the people in their own tongue -- highest testimony of grace towards the world!<a name=326:10></a>

		The visible character that the Holy Ghost takes corresponds to this work.<a name=327:5></a> When it descended on Christ, the Spirit was like unto a dove, symbol of the meekness and sweet tranquillity of Him of whom it was written, "He shall not strive nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets.<a name=327:6></a> A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory" (Matthew 12: 19, 20).<a name=327:7></a> But to the disciples He said, "That which I say in the darkness, tell it in the light; and that which ye have heard in the ear, proclaim it on the house-tops.<a name=327:8></a>"

		The Spirit came then as an impetuous wind, filling all the house, and as cloven tongues of fire.<a name=327:9></a> The partition was symbolical of the diverse languages, the fire of the penetrating power of the word of God, discerner of the thoughts and intentions of the heart.<a name=327:10></a> It seems to us, that not only the apostles, but all the one hundred and twenty, were invested with this power.<a name=327:11></a> They were all together; and the explanation given by Peter of the prophecy of Joel confirms the matter (chapters 1: 14, 15; 2: 1, 17).<a name=327:12></a>

		But what is important in his discourse is the presentation to the conscience of the Jews of their actual position: because, whatever the case may be, God is always clear and positive in the declaration and in the setting out of the sins of those souls where grace works.<a name=328:1></a> In short, this was their position; they had outraged and crucified Him whom God had set at His right hand, His own Son.<a name=328:2></a> Him they had put to death, and God had raised Him up, besides what had been demonstrated by the power manifested in His works.<a name=328:3></a> Horrible position!<a name=328:4></a> and we say it not only for the Jews, but for all men.<a name=328:5></a> Their Messiah, foundation of all their hopes, rejected; the Son of God put to death -- a rupture which seemed irreparable between God and man; and on man's side, it was in fact irreparable.<a name=328:6></a>

		CHAPTER 3
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The third chapter of the Acts is remarkable in the ways of God.<a name=329:1></a> The declaration is not found, as in the second, of a present introduction of those who repent and confess the name of Jesus, into the blessings of the remission of sins, nor of the gift of the Holy Ghost.<a name=329:2></a> Peter shews, as in all his other discourses, that the death of Christ was the effect of the thoughts of God, though He was put to death by wicked hands: but rather as the accomplishment of prophecy than as the fruit of the counsels of God.<a name=329:3></a> The Spirit descends in virtue of the proclamation by the gospel of God's ways with Israel.<a name=329:4></a> The Lord, interceding on the cross for the people, had said, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.<a name=329:5></a>" His prayer was heard, and the judgment of God suspended in the design of presenting repentance to the people once more.<a name=329:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God knew well that the Jews, hard of heart, would not receive the merciful voice of the long-suffering of God; and had warned those who had ears to hear (chapter 2: 40) to save themselves from this untoward generation.<a name=329:7></a> But He would not come to judge till everything possible had been done, and they had rejected a glorified Christ, as they had rejected a Christ come in humiliation here below.<a name=329:8></a> The Spirit, therefore, by the mouth of Peter, starting from the intercession of Christ, proposes repentance to the people, saying, that then Christ would return.<a name=329:9></a> The apostle enters more particularly into the sin of the Jews, and presents the facts with great power to their consciences.<a name=329:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It may seem strange that the apostle should speak of the repentance of all the people, and of sparing them, when the Christian assembly had already commenced, and he had warned them to avoid the judgment which was ready to fall on a people which had crucified the Lord of glory.<a name=329:11></a> But God knew well that the rulers of the people would render His grace vain; and reject the testimony of a glorified Christ, as they had put to death a Christ present in grace.<a name=329:12></a> He prosecuted His counsels according to His own knowledge, but He did not carry out the judgment of His government till everything possible had been done to spare man, inviting them to repentance.<a name=329:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus Abraham was told that his seed must descend into Egypt because the iniquity of the Amorites was not yet accomplished (Genesis 15: 16).<a name=329:14></a> And Jeremiah (chapters 7-14, and in other places) does precisely what Peter does; he says clearly by his prophetical knowledge that the people and the vessels of the temple would go into Babylon: at the same time he exhorts the people to repent, and that thus doing they would be spared.<a name=329:15></a> And it is laid down as a principle, that when Jehovah had pronounced the condemnation of a people or of a city, if that people or that city should repent of its wickedness, He would turn away from the judgment that He had pronounced (Jeremiah 18: 7-11).<a name=329:16></a> Thus, then, the apostle exhorts the people to repent, and Christ would return.<a name=329:17></a>

		Going up to the temple, the apostles Peter and John had healed a man, lame from his birth, who asked alms at the gate called "Beautiful.<a name=330:1></a>" The man goes up together with the apostles, leaping and praising God; a crowd naturally gathers, as the man was well known.<a name=330:2></a> Peter takes advantage of the occasion to put before the eyes of the people what had been done.<a name=330:3></a> It was not by his own power.<a name=330:4></a> The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of their fathers, had raised up His servant Jesus, whom they had put to death.<a name=330:5></a> Horrible position!<a name=330:6></a> what open opposition!<a name=330:7></a> fatal -- if grace had not been there among the people of God.<a name=330:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is thus that Peter always presents the truth.<a name=330:9></a> They had rejected Him, and God had recognised and glorified Him.<a name=330:10></a> And here he enters much more particularly into their sin, more than in chapter 2.<a name=330:11></a> He presents the facts with great power to their consciences.<a name=330:12></a> They had betrayed the Lord, and denied Him in the presence of Pilate when he had decided to let Him go.<a name=330:13></a> They had denied the Holy One and the Just, had desired a murderer, and killed the Prince of Life.<a name=330:14></a> But God had raised Him up -- once more opposition between the people and God.<a name=330:15></a> The name of the risen Saviour at the right hand of God had given to the cripple the perfect health in which they saw him.<a name=330:16></a> And here the Spirit responds in grace to the Lord's intercession; and the apostle attributes to ignorance the terrible fact of having rejected the Lord, whether on the part of the rulers or of the people.<a name=330:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That which had been foreordained by God was now accomplished -- the sufferings of Christ announced before by their prophets; and, if they repented, Jesus would come back: God would send Him from heaven.<a name=330:18></a> Those times of blessing that would be fulfilled on the earth by His presence they would have; times that might come on the Lord's side, but for which the repentance of Israel was absolutely necessary, and for which it is still necessary.<a name=330:19></a> That always remains true.<a name=330:20></a> Their house, said the Lord, should be left unto them desolate, until they should say, "Blessed be he that cometh in the name of Jehovah" (Matthew 23: 38, quoting Psalm 118).<a name=330:21></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But before he could finish his discourse, the rulers of the Jews arrive, take possession of the apostles, and throw them into prison.<a name=331:4></a> Jesus glorified is refused, as completely as Jesus in humiliation.<a name=331:5></a> All is finished for Israel, with respect to its responsibility -- the marvellous patience of God, and the grace that had made intercession for the beloved people on the cross.<a name=331:6></a> Nothing more could be done: it only remained to carry out the judgment of a people who would not have grace.<a name=331:7></a> Such is the history alas!<a name=331:8></a> of the natural man.<a name=331:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us mark this, that here the Holy Ghost is not offered, as in the discourse of the preceding chapter, which began the new order of the ways of God; but he speaks of the return of Christ Himself to accomplish all that the prophets had said.<a name=331:10></a> The presence of the Holy Ghost distinguishes the time between the first and the second coming of Jesus -- the present interval.<a name=331:11></a> I do not say that the Spirit will not be poured out after the second coming; but the coming and presence of Jesus distinguished that period, and His absence the present, as moreover the presence of another Comforter instead of Him.<a name=331:12></a> And this reveals to us a Christ glorified in the heavens, makes Him the object of a living faith, unites us to Him, makes us understand that we are children of God, joint-heirs with Christ, that we are in Him and He in us, and makes us members of His body, while we wait for Him to take us to Himself.<a name=331:13></a> The love of God, too, is shed abroad in our hearts.<a name=331:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Although Peter never speaks of the rapture of the saints to be with Jesus, yet we may turn to 1 Peter 1: 11-13, where we find the testimony of the prophets, that of the Holy Ghost come down from heaven, and the accomplishment of the promises to happen on the appearing of Jesus -- the three things which appear here.<a name=331:15></a> It is not a question of gathering believers to Christ, nor of the coming of the Holy Ghost.<a name=331:16></a> We find ourselves entirely on Jewish ground.<a name=331:17></a> And God, having first raised up His servant Jesus, had sent Him to bless them, that is, down here in the world; and as they would not receive Him, repentance was offered them.<a name=331:18></a> But the rulers interposed, resisting the Holy Ghost, just as they had refused Christ on the earth, thus sealing their own judgment.<a name=331:19></a> The final sentence will be found in the history of Stephen.<a name=331:20></a>

		Another truth is introduced here, which is not wanting in importance in the ways of God; though it may not be equal in importance to the moral state of men which led them to reject the Lord come in grace.<a name=332:1></a> After this moment the throne and the government of God cannot be found on the earth.<a name=332:2></a> The providence of God watches over all; not even a little bird falls to the ground without His hand.<a name=332:3></a> But this throne does not exist on the earth, and will no more exist till the Lord Jesus, the Son of David, establishes it, till He comes to whom it belongs.<a name=332:4></a> The throne of God, between the cherubim, was taken away from Jerusalem when the Jews were led captive into Babylon; but a little remnant of the Jews was brought back to Jerusalem, in order to present to them again their true King, the Son of David, Jesus of Nazareth.<a name=332:5></a> But they would not receive Him.<a name=332:6></a> Thenceforward the kingdom of God is changed to the kingdom of heaven; the King is in heaven, and the kingdom is like the grain of wheat, which, once sown, springs and grows, without man's hand being applied to it (Mark 4: 26).<a name=332:7></a> Christ works; without His grace nothing would be done; but He does not appear.<a name=332:8></a> He sits on the throne of God, and has not taken His own throne; He will take it when He returns.<a name=332:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Thrones are perfectly established by God; the Christian recognises fully the authority of princes and governors as ordinances of God, and submits to them.<a name=332:10></a> But it is not the immediate kingdom of God.<a name=332:11></a> From the captivity of Babylon till the coming of Christ are the "times of the Gentiles"; and God gathers the joint-heirs of Christ, who are not of this world, as He was not.<a name=332:12></a> They are blessed with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ; they will reign with Him in glory, joint-heirs by grace of the inheritance of God.<a name=332:13></a>

		222 There are two great subjects in the Bible, after personal salvation; the divine government of the world with the Jews as centre, under Christ; and the sovereign grace that has given those who are content to suffer with Him the same glory that Christ enjoys as Man, predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He may be the first-born among many brethren.<a name=332:14></a> Already we enjoy the same relationship with His God and Father.<a name=332:15></a> "Go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.<a name=332:16></a>" Already children and heirs here below, when Christ comes we shall rejoice with heavenly joy with Him, and we shall reign with Him.<a name=332:17></a>

		Although a man may be truly a Christian, yet the flesh always remains in him, which is just as ready to shew itself in the assembly as in the world.<a name=338:8></a> The desire to have a good reputation among men may arise in the heart, although such a reputation may merely be sought for among Christians.<a name=338:9></a> Thus too it happened when the assembly of God first began.<a name=338:10></a> Love produced the inclination to think of others rather than of themselves.<a name=338:11></a> But the flesh also would have the reputation of doing so, without denying itself, deceitfully thinking to keep back its money, and at the same time to gain the benefit of a reputation for giving it away.<a name=338:12></a> But here also the great truth of the presence of the Holy Ghost is the subject of God's revelation given in this book.<a name=338:13></a>

		Ananias, whose sin was thus unexpectedly to himself revealed, falls dead by the judgment of God who was there.<a name=339:1></a> But what a solemn judgment!<a name=339:2></a> And it is not surprising if, not only the Christians, but also the outside world, were terrified at such a testimony to the presence of God that was entirely unmistakable.<a name=339:3></a> Moreover the sin was not a simple failure.<a name=339:4></a> Ananias and Sapphira had agreed together in their eagerness of endeavour to deceive God, forgetting that He knew everything and that He was there.<a name=339:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, however sad and solemn the fact might be, it was a testimony from which it was impossible to detract, that God Himself was present; a testimony to the great truth that God, in the person of the Holy Ghost, had come down to dwell in the midst of His people, and for ever (John 14: 17), so that they might be taken up to dwell in the Father's house.<a name=339:6></a> The apostles were filled with it; everything at that time was in the power of it.<a name=339:7></a> But the assembly of God has been unfaithful; the Spirit has been grieved, and therefore we see no longer those actions which bore testimony to His presence.<a name=339:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This, nevertheless, does not in any way render it invalid -- that would be impossible.<a name=339:9></a> The word of Christ is -- He shall dwell with you; and the Spirit is as able to accomplish the will of God in His children now as in the time of the apostles, though it may not be shewn in the same manner.<a name=339:10></a> But it is more blessed, says the Lord, to have our names written in heaven than to cast out demons: and by the true work of God in souls, and in all His ways, He manifests His presence in the assembly, and in Christians who depend on Him, and are filled with Him, just as much as He did in the days of the apostles.<a name=339:11></a> It is not proper that it should be shewn outwardly in the fallen church as in the faithful assembly long ago established by God Himself, as though He sealed its fall with His approbation.<a name=339:12></a> But God changes not, and His grace and power are the same, and are as available as ever for all that is necessary and all that is suitable to the state of the church; and He still does all that is requisite for His glory and our full blessing.<a name=339:13></a> He works in His own with the same power according to the circumstances in which they are placed.<a name=339:14></a>

		Now many signs and wonders were wrought by the hands of the apostles, who were to be found habitually (it seems to us) in Solomon's porch in the temple.<a name=340:1></a> The great and the rulers did not dare to identify themselves with them; but the people, convinced in their simplicity, increased the number and importance of the Christians in the holy city.<a name=340:2></a> We see always fear on the part of the great and of the ecclesiastical rulers.<a name=340:3></a> They could persecute, but they could not join the Christians, because then their power would be compromised.<a name=340:4></a> As Paul says, "not many mighty, not many noble, are called.<a name=340:5></a>" The reproach of Christ is always linked to His name, wherever there is fidelity.<a name=340:6></a>

		But this did nothing more than prepare the way for another display of the hand and power of God.<a name=340:11></a> When God is working, vain are the efforts of men.<a name=340:12></a> We have seen, and shall see, the internal power of the Holy Ghost.<a name=340:13></a> Here we find angels, the servants of God, in favour of the men who preach the good news of salvation through Christ.<a name=340:14></a> I do not doubt that they ever minister, according to the will of God, to all His children who walk in the way of His will; and they may be employed otherwise, if it please God, as it is written in Hebrews 1.<a name=340:15></a> But here they operate in a visible way.<a name=340:16></a> The angel opens the doors of the prison, leads the apostles out, and tells them to go their way, and to speak in the temple all the words of this life, which they do at once at break of day.<a name=340:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Meanwhile the high priest and they that were with him meet together in the great council of the Jews, and send the sergeants, commanding them to bring the apostles before them.<a name=340:18></a> They go therefore to the prison, which they find shut with all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors, but no prisoners within.<a name=340:19></a> The priests, confounded, know not what to think.<a name=340:20></a> Who can make war against God, and not find himself discomfited?<a name=340:21></a> Satan can do much, he can persecute and exercise great influence over unbelieving souls; but, where the working of the power of God is present, he cannot surmount it.<a name=340:22></a> Confidence is found on the part of God's servants; and, at the bottom of their heart, the adversaries are afraid and perplexed.<a name=340:23></a> See Joshua 2: 9; Philippians 1: 23; 1 Peter 3: 6.<a name=340:24></a> Satan had the Sadducees ready to resist the work of the apostles who presented the resurrection, as the Pharisees to oppose Christ who preached true righteousness.<a name=340:25></a>

		But here again the hand of God appears; and as He had miraculously used an angel to let Peter out of prison, so now He employs the hand of man to arrest the power and the malice of the elders and high priest.<a name=341:13></a> The human prudence of the Pharisee Gamaliel, a man much esteemed, gives them to realise, by several examples, the peril of putting themselves in conflict with God.<a name=341:14></a> The Pharisees were always opposed to the Sadducees, and the high priest belonged to the sect of the Sadducees, so that the Pharisee could always employ his human sagacity to gain a hearing.<a name=341:15></a> And God could use it to preserve His servants from the wicked hand of their enemies.<a name=341:16></a>

		And here we have a kind of resume, an explanation of their state, their history from the time of Abraham till that day.<a name=345:1></a> It is the history of man from the moment that God began His dealings with him -- in the beginning, in giving the promise, whether to Israel or to Christ, the true offspring; then in the law, in the prophets, and, finally, in Christ Himself.<a name=345:2></a> All this time the Spirit was working, and now especially, after Christ had been glorified in heaven, as we have seen.<a name=345:3></a> Stephen recounted this history; grace in the call of Abraham; what happened to Joseph and to Moses, wherein the Spirit worked and had been rejected by Israel; then the law violated at the outset in the calf of gold; then the prophets; then Christ Himself; and, finally, the testimony of the Holy Ghost.<a name=345:4></a> They had broken the law, persecuted and put to death the prophets who had spoken of the coming of the Just One, of whom now they had become the betrayers and murderers.<a name=345:5></a> And more than this, they still resisted the Holy Ghost, as their fathers had always done.<a name=345:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All the dealings of God pass before our eyes; the law, the prophets, Christ, the Spirit.<a name=345:7></a> In all, the people are found in enmity against God.<a name=345:8></a> Meanwhile they confided in the temple, of which God had declared by the prophet that the Most High dwelt not in temples made with hands.<a name=345:9></a> Such is the history of Israel -- of man.<a name=345:10></a> Conscience is hardened, will is unchanged in the Sanhedrim, and nothing but hate and opposition to the testimony of the Holy Ghost is revealed; their hearts are goaded to resistance, and put the witness himself to death.<a name=345:11></a> They were unable to answer him; it was indeed their history of which they so loudly boasted -- and what a history!<a name=345:12></a> Man always resists the testimony of the Spirit; and, if the conscience be stung, hatred breaks out violently against the witness.<a name=345:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On the other hand we see a man, a Christian, full of the Holy Ghost, doubtless here manifested in a very special way; but that which was visible to Stephen is the object of faith for us.<a name=345:14></a> Mark first the perfect tranquillity of the servant of Christ.<a name=345:15></a> With beautiful simplicity he tells a story familiar to all -- a story, however, which carried with it the condemnation of the Jews.<a name=345:16></a> To reason with him was needless, for they could not deny the facts.<a name=345:17></a> Then, kneeling down quietly amid the stones which fell on him, he prays for his enemies.<a name=345:18></a> What moral power!<a name=345:19></a> How entirely it overcomes all circumstances, and displays the man of God in the presence of the fury of his adversaries!<a name=345:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But let us examine not only the character of Stephen's testimony against his enemies, but his own state.<a name=346:1></a> He is the embodiment of a man full of the Holy Ghost, and his enemies are the embodiment of men who resist the Spirit.<a name=346:2></a> First, heaven is opened to him; he is enabled to keep his eyes fixed on the heavens -- touch-stone of the state of the soul -- and sees the Son of man standing at the right hand of God.<a name=346:3></a> He saw indeed the glory of God, but does not speak of it; the new and blessed thing was, that Man, in the person of the Son of God, stood there.<a name=346:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe that here He does not sit, because, until the Jews had refused the testimony of His glory, the Saviour was expecting to come back according to the address of Peter.<a name=346:5></a> As soon as Stephen is slain this testimony is at end; and, a single soul in heaven, the gathering of the spirits of the redeemed begins, which will continue till the Lord comes to re-unite the bodies and spirits of His own, and bring them into heavenly glory.<a name=346:6></a> Thus, in the Epistle to the Hebrews, it is said that Jesus is set down at the right hand of God, expecting till His enemies be made His footstool.<a name=346:7></a> He sits down on the throne of the Father, and not yet on His own.<a name=346:8></a> This is what rouses the hatred and fury of the Jews.<a name=346:9></a> They cry out "blasphemy!<a name=346:10></a>" and stone the witness of God, of the glory of Jesus.<a name=346:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		For Stephen heaven is opened, and Jesus is seen in divine glory; and this is what forms his soul in such a beautiful way into the likeness of Jesus.<a name=346:12></a> As He prayed for enemies, so also Stephen prays for his; and as the Lord Jesus commended His spirit to His Father, so Stephen exclaims, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.<a name=346:13></a>" Not only does he pardon his enemies, but quietly kneels down to do so.<a name=346:14></a> The view of Jesus transforms the heart into His likeness.<a name=346:15></a> That which was seen by Stephen is the object of faith for us, made clearer by what happened to him.<a name=346:16></a>

		CHAPTER 8
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		An important fact, which renders the signification of our narrative still clearer, is here presented to us.<a name=347:1></a> Here we find Saul taking part in the death of Stephen.<a name=347:2></a> We have seen that the death of Stephen was the end of the history of the enmity of the human heart against God, when God had done everything to try it, and also to restore it; its incurable enmity was manifested, and the end of man before God.<a name=347:3></a> There was no longer hope of finding any good since God Himself has made use of everything -- judgment in the deluge, the law, the prophets, His own Son, and the testimony of the Holy Ghost.<a name=347:4></a> All was in vain.<a name=347:5></a> The more God worked, the more man's enmity manifested itself.<a name=347:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here for the first time we find Saul.<a name=347:7></a> Not content with taking part in the death of Stephen, he goes into distant cities in search of Christians to bring them bound to Jerusalem.<a name=347:8></a> He is the apostle of man's enmity against Christ.<a name=347:9></a> If the history of man was finished, that of the sovereign grace of God was beginning.<a name=347:10></a> The spirit of the first martyr takes its place in the presence of Jesus.<a name=347:11></a> But the entire number must be completed before Jesus can come and re-unite them with their bodies.<a name=347:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here we find the first general persecution, which, however, in the hands of God, served to scatter the seed of the gospel.<a name=347:13></a> This also is a proof of the free activity of the Holy Ghost to make use of whomsoever He sees fit to select.<a name=347:14></a> Still another important fact: while all the Christians are scattered by the persecution, the apostles remain at Jerusalem.<a name=347:15></a> The special mission of Matthew 10: 23 was not accomplished.<a name=347:16></a> It will be by the power of God hereafter, I doubt not; but not at the moment of which we read here.<a name=347:17></a> It is the multitude of Christians scattered by the persecution who preach the gospel in Palestine, and afterwards among the Gentiles.<a name=347:18></a> Saul persecutes the assembly with cruel zeal; and the Christians leave the city.<a name=347:19></a> It was neither the settled design of man, nor the spiritual zeal of the apostles, but the fury of the enemy, which according to the wisdom of God first disseminated the gospel outside the gates of Jerusalem.<a name=347:20></a> The spirit of Stephen gone up to heaven, the gospel of grace is carried into the surrounding districts by means of the enmity of man, and the providence of God who makes use of it leads the scattered ones to communicate in love the gifts they possess.<a name=347:21></a> What is man?<a name=347:22></a> and what the wisdom and grace of God?<a name=347:23></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another example of the free activity of the Spirit is found in the person of Philip, chosen to take care of the widows.<a name=348:1></a> His service is finished with regard to the widows; but he has acquired a good degree, and great liberty in the faith in Christ Jesus.<a name=348:2></a> Setting out from Jerusalem, he goes down to Samaria; and there by the power of his word, and by the miracles given him to do, the people are liberated from the influence of a notorious instrument of Satan -- Simon, who exercised the arts of sorcery and had been held to be the great power of God.<a name=348:3></a> "Then Simon himself believed also; and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.<a name=348:4></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was the miracles which had exercised this influence over his spirit, not the seed of God, the divine word which had entered into his heart.<a name=348:5></a> To believe by means of miracles alone is not the faith which operates by the Holy Ghost, although God may work miracles and signs in order to confirm His word.<a name=348:6></a> The end of John 2 shews that Jesus did not trust those who had believed in this way.<a name=348:7></a> When the Spirit of God works, requirements are produced in the soul which Jesus alone can satisfy.<a name=348:8></a> Thus Nicodemus was under the influence of the miracles when he went to Jesus.<a name=348:9></a> To the others reasonable conviction sufficed, and they remained where they were.<a name=348:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The sole desire of Simon is to possess the power of conferring on others by the imposition of his hands the ability to work miracles and signs.<a name=348:11></a> He wished to buy it with money, thereby shewing that there was no work of God in his soul.<a name=348:12></a> He had "neither part nor lot in this matter.<a name=348:13></a>" He was in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity; his heart was not right before God.<a name=348:14></a> His sin excited the indignation, not the compassion, of Peter.<a name=348:15></a> "Thy money perish with thee," said he.<a name=348:16></a> But still his heart is not touched with compunction.<a name=348:17></a> He asks only that what had been said might not come upon him; not that his thought might be forgiven, or that the state of his heart might be changed.<a name=348:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here we find still other things which we shall do well to consider.<a name=348:19></a> The difference between the operation and the sealing of the Spirit is very clear.<a name=348:20></a> The Samaritans had believed and had been baptized, but had not received the Holy Ghost; for He had not yet descended upon them.<a name=348:21></a> He had worked by the word in their hearts; men and women were converted, born again, had confessed the name of Jesus; but they were not yet sealed.<a name=348:22></a> Then it belonged in a special manner to the apostles to impose hands, and confer the gift of the Spirit.<a name=348:23></a> In Acts 19 we see that Paul conferred it; he was a true apostle.<a name=348:24></a> Ananias was sent that Saul might receive it; this was a special mission of the Lord Himself.<a name=348:25></a> The Spirit might also come without the laying on of hands, as on the hundred and twenty, and on Cornelius; but not one had the power of conferring it save the apostles.<a name=348:26></a> It is said, "of the apostles' hand" (verse 18).<a name=348:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=349>[Page 349]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is possible, too, that the Spirit might come on a man in this way without an internal work giving life.<a name=349:1></a> The Lord does not habitually work thus; but cases of it are not wanting in the Old Testament, such as Balaam, king Saul, and others, where the question of conversion is not raised, shewing that that is another thing altogether.<a name=349:2></a> In the New Testament we do not find a case of it, but the thing is supposed (1 Corinthians 12; Hebrews 6), and the power to do miracles with the aid of the Holy Ghost and without conversion and life, is clearly presented by the Lord Himself (Matthew 12: 26, 27); the Lord does not deny the fact, but declares that He knows not those who have done them; Matthew 7.<a name=349:3></a> See Deuteronomy 13.<a name=349:4></a> Judas at least was sent to do such.<a name=349:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We see then a new character of the apostolic authority; then the free activity of the Spirit clearly displayed in Philip.<a name=349:6></a> By his means the gospel is communicated to a distant country through a proselyte come to Jerusalem to worship the true God; a man in whose heart the word of God possessed full power.<a name=349:7></a> It is beautiful to remark in Philip the readiness of his obedience -- how he allowed himself to be led by the will of God.<a name=349:8></a> He is the object of all attention in the city of Samaria: a notable work had been done by means of him.<a name=349:9></a> "Arise," said the angel of the Lord, "and go unto Gaza, which is desert"; but he was not told what he was to do there.<a name=349:10></a> And he goes there immediately.<a name=349:11></a> There he finds the treasurer of the Queen of Ethiopia.<a name=349:12></a> The Spirit says to him, "Go near and join thyself to this chariot"; and he runs immediately to it.<a name=349:13></a> The treasurer was reading the word of God, but the key of faith in Jesus was wanting.<a name=349:14></a> Philip mounts the chariot, and preaches faith in Jesus to him.<a name=349:15></a> All was ordered by God.<a name=349:16></a> He was reading what was immediately connected with the sufferings of the Lord; and by the power of the Spirit the explanation of the passage is sent him by the mouth of Philip.<a name=349:17></a> The eunuch, with the heart prepared by grace, and already having faith in the word, becomes a Christian.<a name=349:18></a> He is baptized by Philip, and goes on his way rejoicing.<a name=349:19></a> It is remarkable that the name of Christianity remains to this day in that country, much corrupted (it is true), but in the form which this man implanted.<a name=349:20></a> They believe as to the profession of Christ, but practise circumcision -- (verse 37 is not authentic).<a name=349:21></a>

		CHAPTER 9
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have glanced at the history of the free activity of the Spirit in those who were dispersed by the persecution, in Stephen, and in Philip.<a name=350:6></a> Then follows the deeply interesting narrative of Saul and of his conversion.<a name=350:7></a> In that of Stephen we saw that man had reached the extreme end of his iniquity, not only in crucifying the Lord, but in refusing the offer of grace, and of His return in virtue of the Saviour's intercession on the cross.<a name=350:8></a> There, for the first time, we find Saul; but he is not content with this quiet hatred.<a name=350:9></a> "And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest, and desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that, if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem.<a name=350:10></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He is the apostle, of his own will, of hatred against Christ, and of the persecution of God's children.<a name=350:11></a> Now the Lord allowed this, in order to make him the witness and apostle of the sovereign grace which opened his eyes, converted and pardoned him.<a name=350:12></a> Here it is evidently sovereign grace meeting the fury of the ardent enemy of truth and grace, who sought, as he himself says, to destroy Christianity, and banish the name of Christ from the face of the earth.<a name=350:13></a> While occupied in this very purpose, the Lord stops him on his way, and reveals Himself to his soul, and also to his eyes, so that he might be an eye-witness of His glory.<a name=350:14></a> A light from heaven shone round about him -- "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?<a name=350:15></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=351>[Page 351]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But two very important truths are contained in this remarkable scene.<a name=351:1></a> The Lord's glory is revealed.<a name=351:2></a> Saul had not seen the Lord -- had not followed Him when present in the flesh.<a name=351:3></a> The twelve apostles had known Him in the days of His flesh, and had seen Him disappear in the cloud; they knew by faith that He was seated at the right hand of God, but they could not be eye-witnesses of His glory.<a name=351:4></a> It is then that Paul begins.<a name=351:5></a> He saw the Lord's glory, but knew not who He was.<a name=351:6></a> One thing he was certain of -- the glory and the voice of the Lord Himself had appeared to him.<a name=351:7></a> He asks therefore, "Who art thou, Lord?<a name=351:8></a>" Then the Lord replies, "I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.<a name=351:9></a>" He was not a man of the earth, nor the Messiah gone up to heaven, but the Lord of glory recognising Himself still as Jesus, and also Jesus of Nazareth.<a name=351:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The starting-point of the doctrine is different: the same redemption, the same Saviour; but the revelation given to the twelve is that the man Jesus is gone up to heaven; God has exalted Him.<a name=351:11></a> The revelation given to Saul is that the Lord of glory is Jesus of Nazareth.<a name=351:12></a> It begins with heavenly glory; then, in the second place, that all Christians are united with Himself, members of His body.<a name=351:13></a> This doctrine is not unfolded but it is not said, "Why persecutest thou My disciples?<a name=351:14></a>" as a doctor or a rabbi, but "Why persecutest thou <i>me</i>?<a name=351:15></a>" And this is the Lord of glory.<a name=351:16></a> "I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.<a name=351:17></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such are the fundamental points in the history of Paul, the enemy of the Lord of glory, converted, pardoned, justified, necessary witness of sovereign grace.<a name=351:18></a> The gospel of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ, of the glory of the Lord, is confided to him; then the truth of the union, of the unity of Christians with Christ, glorious Head in heaven.<a name=351:19></a> Peter preached that God had glorified Him whom the Jews had crucified, and invited the rebels to come to God by the sacrifice which he had perfected; and to those who repented Jesus would return.<a name=351:20></a> Saul preached that this salvation was for all men; and that God, as Saviour, could not limit Himself to the narrow bounds of Israel, but that He announced Himself to the whole creation under heaven; then, that the assembly of God was united to Jesus, His body.<a name=351:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We shall see that God did not permit disunion, but desired that there should be a single assembly.<a name=351:22></a> But it is not the less true that Paul was a witness that there was no difference, that all men were lost, all children of wrath, one just as another; and that Jesus, by the gift of the Holy Ghost, had united all in one body -- a truth which the Jews (and also the Christian Jews) always resisted, tormenting the apostle in his work.<a name=351:23></a> Peter himself dissimulated, so that all the Christian Jews, led by his authority, which was only the fear of man, sided with him.<a name=351:24></a> Not one of the apostles speaks in his epistles of the assembly, the body of Christ on earth, save only Paul.<a name=351:25></a> The glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ; sovereign grace, by which he was the example to all those who should afterwards believe in Christ Jesus; and the whole in virtue of the cross -- such was the gospel confided to Paul.<a name=351:26></a>

		God had drawn him away from all communication with the outside world, in order that he might be entirely occupied with his soul, and with the state in which he found himself.<a name=352:7></a> In fact his situation was without a parallel.<a name=352:8></a> Externally he was a man without spot, of irreproachable reputation according to the law; he had a good conscience.<a name=352:9></a> He believed it his duty to do much against the name of Jesus, and he did it.<a name=352:10></a> The authorities of the religion of the fathers encouraged and sent him, in every way supporting him in what he did with such zeal; conscience, legal justice, religion, all that formed his moral life, had made him the fierce enemy of the Lord of glory.<a name=352:11></a> But at one blow all the foundations of his moral life were ruined.<a name=352:12></a> It was by these very foundations that he became the enemy of the Lord, and resisted the Spirit who called men to repentance by the testimony rendered to His glory.<a name=352:13></a> Saul had assisted in an active way in this opposition, when the Jews stoned Stephen.<a name=352:14></a> But this did not satisfy him.<a name=352:15></a> His zeal required that he should persecute also those who believed in distant parts.<a name=352:16></a> Thus occupied he meets with the Lord, whose name he was seeking to extirpate.<a name=352:17></a> He was therefore the head, the chief, of sinners; in ignorance it is true, but nevertheless willingly.<a name=352:18></a> Where was his good conscience according to man?<a name=352:19></a> Where his legal justice?<a name=352:20></a> Where his religion, of which the priests and religious authorities had for him been supreme before?<a name=352:21></a> All had led him to discover himself an enemy of fiery zeal to the Lord, face to face with whom he found himself now, but still the object of His grace, at the very moment when he was occupied so thoroughly in destroying His glory.<a name=352:22></a> What a revulsion!<a name=352:23></a> What an overturning in his heart!<a name=352:24></a> Who can tell what passed in him during those three days?<a name=352:25></a>

		And yet the Lord does not send Ananias to him till this internal moral work was completed.<a name=353:1></a> Old things have passed away, and now all things have become new in his soul, in the bottom of his thoughts; all is of God who has revealed Himself in the glory of the face of Jesus Christ.<a name=353:2></a> He is no longer a Jew, although he may be one externally: but he has not become a Gentile; joined to the Lord of glory, Jesus Christ, he knows henceforth no man any more after the flesh.<a name=353:3></a> He knows the Lord, he knows His people as united with Him, Gentiles and Jews alike lost sinners, children of wrath; but he knows the sovereign grace towards himself which has called him, has revealed the Son of God to him, and has given him eternal life, even while engaged in destroying His name.<a name=353:4></a> All was grace, pure and sovereign grace, grace which went so far as to make of Christians one body with Christ in heaven, and to give them to know it.<a name=353:5></a> How marvellous the revelations we find unfolded in the epistles of the apostle!<a name=353:6></a> The gospel of the glory of Christ is easily understood when we realise how and when the apostle was converted.<a name=353:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But it is worth while considering some of the circumstances which accompanied the conversion of the apostle.<a name=353:8></a> The Lord made use of a converted Jew, hated by his countrymen, to convey to Paul the formal testimony of His grace, and receive him into the bosom of the assembly, in order that, as we before said, he might never more fear, the vision having passed away that might be mistaken.<a name=353:9></a> Here is a quiet man who had received a communication from the Lord, fully confirming what had happened to Saul.<a name=353:10></a> Moreover, Saul is made by another revelation to expect Ananias so that he may receive his sight by the laying on of his hands.<a name=353:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But I should like to call attention to still other circumstances -- the full liberty, and, one may say, the familiarity with which Ananias speaks to the Lord (with reverence and submission, of course); and, in the same way, the Lord with him.<a name=354:1></a> When the Lord calls him, he replies immediately, "Here am I.<a name=354:2></a>" Nevertheless the Lord, the Man who interests Himself in His own as friends whom He loves, speaks with an open heart to Ananias; shewing him not only the way, the house where Saul was to be found, but that which was necessary to identify him, namely, that Saul prayed and that he had seen Ananias coming to him to lay hands on him and restore his sight -- just as one tells a servant what to say, or to a friend what is in the heart.<a name=354:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus the Lord took knowledge of what Paul was doing, and speaks of it to Ananias.<a name=354:4></a> And we see in the answer of Ananias a perfect trust in this goodness of the Lord.<a name=354:5></a> He begins to reason with the Lord.<a name=354:6></a> He had heard that this man was come to bind those who called upon the name of the Lord.<a name=354:7></a> And the Lord does not reprove him.<a name=354:8></a> Of course he had to go and do what the Lord desired; but He explains the matter to him, and communicates to him His thoughts concerning Saul, that he was a chosen vessel to bear His name, and that He would shew him what things he should suffer for His name's sake.<a name=354:9></a> In a word the Lord opens His heart to Ananias, as a to friend whom He treats with full confidence, speaks naturally, but confidingly tells all He feels to Ananias.<a name=354:10></a>

		It is very important to remember that Jesus is always man.<a name=354:11></a> If He were not God, His humanity would have no value; but, being God, the fact that He interests Himself in us as a man, as men whom He is not ashamed to call His brethren, is infinitely precious.<a name=354:12></a> He can feel with us, take part in all our circumstances, trials, difficulties, and troubles.<a name=354:13></a> He loves us as the Father loved Him, a man and Son on the earth.<a name=354:14></a> His love has divine perfection, but He feels as a man, as a man on the earth, tempted in like manner as we are apart from sin.<a name=354:15></a> He is ever a man; He thinks of us as One who has passed through all these things with divine love and human sympathy.<a name=354:16></a> Not only does He know everything as God, but He has had the experience of a man.<a name=354:17></a> Precious truth, unfathomable grace!<a name=354:18></a>

		Thus sent and encouraged, Ananias obeys, goes in perfect confidence towards him who not long before breathed out threatenings and slaughter against the Christians; and lays his hands on him, saying, "Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.<a name=355:3></a>" Saul immediately receives his sight, and rises, is baptized, eats, and walks with the disciples at Damascus.<a name=355:4></a> Without delay he preaches Christ in the synagogues, declaring Him to be the Son of God.<a name=355:5></a> Although the lion had become a lamb, yet he had not lost his energy; but his object is different; now he preaches what he had formerly sought to destroy.<a name=355:6></a> The subject of his preaching differs a little from that of Peter, and responds to the revelation of Christ, which was made to him.<a name=355:7></a> Peter preached that God had exalted the Jesus whom they had rejected; Saul, that Christ was the Son of God.<a name=355:8></a>

		The narrative now returns to the work of Peter.<a name=356:6></a> Although Saul was called to preach the gospel to the nations, and was set apart to this mission by a special dispensation of God founded on a more perfect revelation; which left the Jews behind as sinners by nature as well as the Gentiles, and taught that there was no difference, since all had sinned, bringing in the new creation, and knowing Christ no more after the flesh; yet there were not to be two assemblies; the oneness of the church was to be maintained.<a name=356:7></a>

		As to the progress of the gospel, let us see what is taught us in the sequel.<a name=356:11></a> We shall find that those who had been scattered, being Hellenists, or Jews who had lived in foreign countries, and were accustomed to maintain daily intercourse with the Gentiles, spoke with these: so that the free action of the Spirit also communicated by this means the gospel to the Gentiles.<a name=356:12></a> Paul had a new formal mission to every creature under heaven, and then he taught what the assembly was -- a truth set forth by no other.<a name=356:13></a> See Colossians 1.<a name=356:14></a> And he himself was to be a member of the assembly, already founded and established on Christ, which was His body, the habitation of God through the Spirit, though he alone taught this doctrine.<a name=356:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not without importance to remark that the Romish system is founded on the authority of Peter, and draws all its pretensions from him; but the doctrine of the church was never confided to Peter.<a name=356:16></a> Peter was not the apostle of the uncircumcision, but of the circumcision (Galatians 2); full of power for the work among the Jews, he left that among the Gentiles entirely in the hands of Paul.<a name=356:17></a> Peter does not speak of the body of Christ, we who are Gentiles; and the instrument whom God adopted to establish the church among the Gentiles was Paul; 1 Corinthians 3.<a name=356:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		While Peter remains in Simon's house, God is occupied with the Gentiles, of whom Peter was not thinking and, even when he did think of them, not at all disposed to admit them among the believing Jews.<a name=357:9></a> The angel of God appears to Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band, a devout man, faithful according to the knowledge he possessed, fearing God, and praying continually.<a name=357:10></a> He was then converted, but did not know that salvation which had been announced by grace in Jesus, obtained for us on the cross.<a name=357:11></a> There are many people who, though they may have learned more than Cornelius, and who bear the name of Christians, have not got beyond this state.<a name=357:12></a> These are like the prodigal son (Luke 15), when he repents and arises to go to his father.<a name=357:13></a> He was on the right way, but he did not know how he would be received by his father.<a name=357:14></a> Such people possess perhaps more light, but as to their relation with God, they are in the same state.<a name=357:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the conversion of Cornelius, and his introduction to the Christian assembly, was evidently of great importance.<a name=357:16></a> The Gentiles were to participate in the grace and blessing of the gospel.<a name=357:17></a> The promises had been given to the Jews -- none of them to the Gentiles; but the revelation of the grace of God could not be limited to one people.<a name=357:18></a> In His government of the world God could choose a people for Himself, when mankind had abandoned Him and had altogether fallen into idolatry, in order to maintain on the earth the knowledge of the one true God, and to put the heart of man to the test, shew what it was, and unfold His ways in the midst of mankind.<a name=357:19></a> But God, revealed in grace according to His nature, could not in any way be the God of a single nation.<a name=357:20></a>

		Hidden behind the veil, He could give a perfect law, promises, and prophecies; but at the death of Christ the veil is rent in twain, God is fully revealed in grace and justice, and could no longer be the God of the Jews only.<a name=358:1></a> Moreover, at the death of Christ, the Jews as a nation were set aside till they should repent.<a name=358:2></a> Yes, it was God's will that the Gentiles should take part in the new blessings of grace.<a name=358:3></a> All were sinners; but God purified by faith one as freely as another.<a name=358:4></a>

		As Peter seeks for the interpretation of the vision, the men sent by Cornelius come to the door and ask for him; and the Spirit tells Peter to go with them, doubting nothing; for, said the Spirit, I have sent them.<a name=359:1></a> Peter, therefore, brings them in and lodges them, and on the morrow goes away with them, only taking the precaution of getting certain brethren to accompany him.<a name=359:2></a> Arrived at Caesarea, Cornelius throws himself at his feet as the messenger of God.<a name=359:3></a> Peter lifts him up, and asks for what reason he had sent for him.<a name=359:4></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Still the principal thing remained.<a name=359:16></a> Cornelius was already converted, devout, faithful, and full of the fear of God, according to the light he possessed.<a name=359:17></a> But he did not know salvation, the work of the Saviour, and its efficacy.<a name=359:18></a> Led only by the grace of God, he received with faith what Peter told him.<a name=359:19></a> Now it was declared to him that, according to the testimony of all the prophets, he who believed in Jesus received the remission of his sins.<a name=359:20></a> The Holy Ghost seals by His coming this truth received with simple faith into the hearts of Cornelius and his friends.<a name=359:21></a> The Holy Ghost is given then to the Gentiles, without their becoming Jews or being circumcised.<a name=359:22></a> Henceforth it was impossible not to receive them into the Christian assembly.<a name=359:23></a> God had received them, and had put His seal on them.<a name=359:24></a> Peter commands them to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.<a name=359:25></a>

		We have here four distinct points: the conversion of the soul by grace (Cornelius was already converted, and his prayers and alms accepted by God); then the testimony of the remission of his sins by faith in Jesus, the victim by whom propitiation was made for us on the cross; then the seal of God in the gift of the Holy Ghost; and, finally, the formal reception among the Christians.<a name=360:1></a> This order is not that which is found elsewhere; because God was here shewing that it was His will that the Gentiles should be received.<a name=360:2></a> But it is important to distinguish the four things, and to observe the true force of each of them.<a name=360:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		CHAPTER 11
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The difficulty to the Jews of receiving the Gentiles was a great one.<a name=360:4></a> To do so was to give up all their privileges, all that remained of the ancient glory of Israel.<a name=360:5></a> Peter therefore, on his return to Jerusalem, is reproved; he had eaten with the Gentiles.<a name=360:6></a> Peter narrates all that had happened, and how God had given them the gift just as to believing Jews; how then could he hinder God?<a name=360:7></a> The Spirit had sent him to the Gentiles; the Spirit had been given to them.<a name=360:8></a> It was the accomplishment of the words of John the Baptist; and other brethren were witnesses to the gift of the Holy Ghost.<a name=360:9></a> The Jews could no longer resist the clear evidence of the will of God.<a name=360:10></a> Grace overcoming in their hearts, they exclaim, "Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life.<a name=360:11></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is important to ponder deeply the difference between conversion and salvation.<a name=360:12></a> I have already spoken on this subject, but it is one that is so much neglected, and Christians are so accustomed to be content with a low state of soul, and are so uncertain with regard to salvation, that I shall take the opportunity of adding a few more words.<a name=360:13></a> Cornelius was already converted; his prayers and alms were acceptable to God.<a name=360:14></a> He was to call for Peter, who would tell him words whereby he might be saved.<a name=360:15></a> God had been working in his soul, but he did not yet know the value of the work accomplished by the Saviour.<a name=360:16></a> It is the same in the case of the woman in Luke 7; she loved the Lord deeply, had felt the height of His grace and the depth of her sins; but knew not that all was pardoned.<a name=360:17></a> The Lord tells her so.<a name=360:18></a> The prodigal son was converted, confessed his sins, and turned towards his father, but he was not yet clothed with the best garment.<a name=360:19></a> His father had not yet fallen on his neck, he knew not his love; he hardly hoped to be admitted as a servant, and was not in a fit state to enter into the house.<a name=360:20></a> Every privilege awaited him, but he did not possess them.<a name=360:21></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I doubt not that He who has begun the good work will continue it till the day of Christ Jesus.<a name=361:1></a> As long as a soul reasons about its state, seeks to know whether it is saved or converted, and judges by its own heart of what is in the heart of God, it is under law; salvation for such an one depends on his own state, not on the love of God and the efficacy of the work of Christ.<a name=361:2></a> He may perhaps say he is truly converted; he feels the need of salvation, and believes that others have found it; but he does not himself possess it; just as Israel was not out of the land of Egypt till the sea was crossed.<a name=361:3></a> Two things, which cannot be separated, are necessary; faith in the work of Christ, and the knowledge that it is finished.<a name=361:4></a> I say they cannot be separated, because, when we believe in the work of Christ, and by faith trust in it, we are sealed by the Holy Ghost; we enjoy peace (the love of God being shed abroad in our hearts), we are reconciled to God, and in Christ are made meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light; and we know it by the Holy Ghost given to us.<a name=361:5></a> In spirit we are in the Father's house, partaking of the food with which He nourishes His beloved children.<a name=361:6></a> Not only has the heart turned towards God, but Christ is our righteousness, who also appears for us continually before the face of God.<a name=361:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before the narrative of the mission of the apostle Paul, we find once more the free activity of the Holy Ghost in all the members of the body of Christ.<a name=361:8></a> Those who had been dispersed by the persecution raised against the Christians on the death of Stephen were preaching everywhere, but for the most part to the Jew only.<a name=361:9></a> It never occurred to them that the grace and the thoughts of God could overstep the limits of His people after the flesh.<a name=361:10></a> A few of them, however, who, living in Gentile districts (especially at Antioch), daily came in contact with the Gentiles and desired their salvation also, preached the Lord Jesus to them.<a name=361:11></a> And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number, having believed, were converted to the Lord.<a name=361:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we find that no sooner is the unity of the assembly secured by the admission of Cornelius to it by means of Peter -- he first making use of the keys of the kingdom to admit, according to the Lord's promise, the Gentiles also -- than the free action of the Spirit is reproduced.<a name=362:1></a> The gospel is spread among the nations, not by means of Peter, nor of Paul, who afterwards became the great minister of God towards the Gentiles, but by means of the faithful, stirred up by the love of Christ reigning in their hearts, and giving them the desire that His name should be glorified.<a name=362:2></a> It was not a question of ordination, nor of human consecration.<a name=362:3></a> All, except the apostles, had been scattered, and all were preaching.<a name=362:4></a> That there are especial gifts is evident in the word, but it was love to Christ and souls that opened their mouths.<a name=362:5></a>

		And observe, the fact is not merely recorded in the word, but their activity is approved by the Lord.<a name=362:6></a> "The hand of the Lord was with them.<a name=362:7></a>" The gospel was first preached to the Gentiles by private Christians, moved by the grace of God to communicate to others the blessing which they themselves enjoyed; and they sought to establish the authority of Christ over mankind, and glorify His name -- an important principle clearly demonstrated in this narrative.<a name=362:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us bear in mind that the first dissemination of the gospel among the nations was effected, not by means of official preachers, but by ordinary Christians, not sent out by men; but moved by love to Christ.<a name=362:9></a> Subsequently Paul was sent expressly by the Holy Ghost, and received apostolic gifts; but he was not sent by the other apostles but directly by God and by Jesus Christ, by means of the Holy Ghost.<a name=362:10></a> Moreover, in the providence of God, the free activity of Christians became the occasion of his mission.<a name=362:11></a> "Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem; and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch: who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord.<a name=362:12></a> For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith; and much people was added unto the Lord.<a name=362:13></a>" Then Barnabas goes to seek for Paul, whom the brethren had brought to Caesarea, from whence he had gone to his native city, Tarsus.<a name=362:14></a> We have seen that Barnabas was a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, but he was not a man capable of taking the initiative, of starting and maintaining such a work as that of the conversion of the Gentiles.<a name=362:15></a> Thus, though blessed by God, he is not His instrument for this work.<a name=362:16></a> He was himself conscious of this, and so, with kindness and simplicity of heart, and doubtless led of God, seeks the instrument chosen and called by God.<a name=362:17></a> He had already introduced him to the Jews at Jerusalem, who were afraid of their late persecutor.<a name=362:18></a>

		Moreover, he drew neither his authority nor his mission from the apostles who preceded him; his mission did not even originate at Jerusalem, and was not dependent on the sanction of the apostles there, nor of the church at that place.<a name=368:1></a> His mission was given directly from God and from Christ.<a name=368:2></a> Personally called by Christ three years before, he is now sent by the Holy Ghost, and departs from Antioch, a Gentile city, from the bosom of an assembly where the Gentiles had first gathered together.<a name=368:3></a> He did not go to or from another assembly.<a name=368:4></a> The superstition and legality of the Jews very nearly did so, but God did not permit it, as we shall see.<a name=368:5></a> His mission was nevertheless entirely independent; it was dependent on the authority of Christ alone, and on the power of the Holy Ghost.<a name=368:6></a> The apostle insists much on this point in the first two chapters of the epistle to the Galatians.<a name=368:7></a>

		He desired to be absolutely independent of Peter and the others; and not only did he assert his having been sent from God Himself, but he was obliged to rebuke Peter, who, for fear of those who came from Jerusalem, had been unfaithful to the truth and to his own convictions.<a name=368:8></a> Paul was free from all men, subject to Christ, and in love the servant of all; a model and example for all Christians, as indeed he himself tells us.<a name=368:9></a> He fully recognised the mission of Peter to the Jews, as well as that of the other apostles; but though he preached the same gospel as they, his mission was directly from God Himself.<a name=368:10></a>

		Leaving Perga, they come to another Antioch, in Pisidia, where they enter into the synagogue of the Jews.<a name=370:1></a> Called on by the rulers of the synagogue to exhort the congregation (for the ministry was freer among the Jews than in modern Christian churches), they announce Jesus and the resurrection.<a name=370:2></a> Let us notice certain points in this address.<a name=370:3></a> As was generally the case, it was composed of facts.<a name=370:4></a> The apostle briefly relates the history of Israel till the time of David; and then lays down the two fundamental parts of the gospel -- namely, the fulfilment of the promises, and the powerful intervention of God in the resurrection of Christ, by which He was shewn to be the Son of God.<a name=370:5></a> In this way also he begins the Epistle to the Romans.<a name=370:6></a> All the narratives of the Acts depend on the mission given at the end of Luke.<a name=370:7></a> The subjects are repentance and remission of sins.<a name=370:8></a> For Israel the way had been prepared by John the Baptist.<a name=370:9></a> Then God, according to His promise, raised up (not raised from among the dead) a Saviour.<a name=370:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Such was free grace, poured out on all, leaving the strict confines of Judaism, and directing itself to the whole world.<a name=371:13></a> But still the grace of God, mingled with faith, was necessary to make the truth enter the heart, so that it might be born of God.<a name=371:14></a> This is what happens here.<a name=371:15></a> The power of God accompanied the word and "as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.<a name=371:16></a>" The result is this: -- opposition on the part of the Jews, testimony throughout all the earth (except at Jerusalem, chapter 15), and the operation of grace in the heart, whereby it is led to the acceptance of the gospel.<a name=371:17></a>

		But the Jews (not satisfied with having driven the apostles from Antioch and Iconium, and moved by an animosity, grievous to the heart, against the gospel) come to Lystra also, and persuade the people, who, ignorant and fickle, now seek to stone those whom, shortly before, they had been ready to adore.<a name=373:12></a> Paul, the more culpable in their eyes because the more active in the work, is stoned, and, apparently dead, is dragged out of the city.<a name=373:13></a> Such is man -- such the religious, when they have not the truth; Paul himself had been such -- but such also is the power of the gospel, when active in an unbelieving world.<a name=373:14></a>

		Now another part of their work is here presented.<a name=374:8></a> They continue to preach the gospel; but it was now necessary to establish assemblies, and put them in regular order (verse 23).<a name=374:9></a> They give the disciples to understand that Christ was not come to bring peace on the earth which would meet with the opposition and enmity of the world, but that through much tribulation they must enter the kingdom of God.<a name=374:10></a> It was a warning for all times to make men understand that persecution was not a strange thing.<a name=374:11></a> "All that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution" -- not, however, all Christians.<a name=374:12></a> If a Christian conforms to the world, he will avoid persecution; but he will lose the joy of the Holy Ghost and communion with God; he will be saved as by fire, and an entrance into the eternal kingdom shall not be abundantly ministered to him.<a name=374:13></a> If we walk with God, we shall not be barren in the knowledge of the Lord Jesus.<a name=374:14></a>

		The apostles chose elders for the assemblies in every city.<a name=375:1></a> It is neither chose by common vote, nor ordained; this is not the true rendering of the word, but "chose.<a name=375:2></a>" The same word is employed in 2 Corinthians 8: 19, where the assemblies chose brethren to accompany Paul with the money collected for the poor of Jerusalem.<a name=375:3></a> The same word occurs again in Acts 10: 41, where it is used in respect of God, and "chosen" is necessarily the sense.<a name=375:4></a> The apostles then chose elders for the assemblies.<a name=375:5></a> The epistle to Titus is another proof that the authority of the apostles was the source of that of the elders.<a name=375:6></a> I do not dwell here, however, on this question, though it is an important one, since the ordinary translation leads to putting the truth in a false light.<a name=375:7></a>

		We have not in these days apostolical authority; and election made by the assembly is a thing unknown to the word.<a name=375:8></a> The authority descended from Christ to the apostle, and from the apostle to the elder.<a name=375:9></a> The word Bishop, in its present acceptation, is also unknown in the word.<a name=375:10></a> All the elders are really called bishops, as in Acts 20: 17, 28; no other bishops are found in scripture; and at the beginning Paul and Barnabas chose them for every assembly among the Gentiles, as afterwards Paul sent Titus to establish them in every town in the island of Crete.<a name=375:11></a>

		It is important here to observe that the apostle not only preached the gospel for the salvation of souls, which was his principal work, but that he united the converts in assemblies, to which he was afterwards able to write; and that the church or assembly which he founded in every city was properly ordered and represented the universal assembly, of which those who in each place composed it were members 1 Corinthians 12), with the promise that Jesus would be in the midst of them.<a name=375:12></a> But the wickedness of Christians, or of Christians so-called, and forgetfulness of Christ's return (Matthew 24: 48-50), have corrupted Christianity according to the prophecies of the New Testament.<a name=375:13></a> See 2 Timothy 3: 1-5; Jude 4; 1 John 2: 18, 19; Matthew 13: 28-30.<a name=375:14></a> All is disorder, confusion, and corruption.<a name=375:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The testimony is as clear as day, if we have ears to hear what is written in the word; that in the time of the apostles the corruption of the assembly of God had already commenced, and that, when the apostolic energy of Paul should be absent, evil from within and from without would inundate the church like a deluge.<a name=376:3></a> Matthew 13: 29, 30, teaches us that the evil effected by the enemy in the kingdom of God should not be taken away till the judgment.<a name=376:4></a> It all exists still, while the patience of God gathers in His own.<a name=376:5></a>

		Then, when they had prayed with fasting and had commended them that believed to the Lord, the apostles go down by Pisidia to the sea-shore, preach in Perga, and pass on to Antioch.<a name=376:6></a> Here we see the true force of what had been done in chapter 13: 3.<a name=376:7></a> They had been recommended to the grace of God, for the work they had now fulfilled.<a name=376:8></a> This is repeated in chapter 15: 40; so that Paul would have been twice ordained, if this had been ordination; and he would moreover have been an apostle ordained by the laity.<a name=376:9></a> This, however, he stoutly denies (Galatians 1: 1); "an apostle," he says, "not of men, neither by man.<a name=376:10></a>" The Judaizers sought to have it so, but he refuted it with all his power.<a name=376:11></a> These insisted that his mission was from the church at Jerusalem, and opposed him precisely because it was not.<a name=376:12></a> He was not willing to be an apostle at all, if not from God, and from Jesus Christ.<a name=376:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the Jews -- those at least who made a profession of Christianity with Satan as their instrument -- sought to place the Gentiles under the yoke of Judaism, and destroy the work of God within, if they could not hinder it without the church.<a name=377:1></a> They went down from Judaea to Antioch, teaching the brethren that they must be circumcised, and observe the law of Moses, in order to be saved.<a name=377:2></a> The moment was a critical one.<a name=377:3></a> It was necessary, according to them, that the Gentiles should submit to the law of Moses, and become Jews, or that two separate assemblies should be formed.<a name=377:4></a> Paul and Barnabas, however, oppose themselves to these exactions.<a name=377:5></a> But God did not permit the question to be settled at Antioch.<a name=377:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It will readily be understood, that, had the cause of the Gentiles been vindicated by a decision given at Antioch, and, in spite of the Jews, they had preserved their liberty, the danger would have been imminent of two assemblies being formed, and of unity being lost.<a name=377:7></a> All the spiritual and apostolical power of Paul therefore was insufficient to overcome the opposing spirit at Antioch, and decide the question.<a name=377:8></a> It was God's will that it should be decided at Jerusalem, and that the Christian Jews themselves, the apostles, the elders, and the whole assembly, should pronounce the freedom of the Gentiles; and that thus holy liberty and unity should be secured.<a name=377:9></a> It is decided, therefore, that Barnabas and Paul shall go to Jerusalem concerning this matter.<a name=377:10></a> We learn from Galatians 2: 2, that Paul went thither in obedience to direct revelation.<a name=377:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God permitted that these Jews, without mission, zealous without God for the law, the authority of which over the conscience had been terminated by the cross, should raise this question, so that it might be definitively settled.<a name=377:12></a> The apostles and elders, therefore, meet together.<a name=377:13></a> It seems that all the believers may have been present, since verse 12 speaks of the multitude; however it is the apostles and elders who meet together.<a name=377:14></a> Paul and Barnabas relate what has happened in their journey -- the conversion of the Gentiles -- and the brethren rejoice with great joy.<a name=377:15></a> Here the most simple hearts enjoy with simplicity the grace of God.<a name=377:16></a> But at Jerusalem they met with greater difficulty.<a name=377:17></a> Nothing could be more opposed to grace than the doctrine of the Pharisees, which asserted that righteousness must be obtained by works, and by the administration of ordinances.<a name=377:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Arrived at Jerusalem, they declare there also all things that God has done with them.<a name=378:1></a> But here God in His grace manifests the question as having been produced by the hardness of the heart; that is, that some of the sect of the Pharisees who had believed demanded that the Gentiles should be circumcised.<a name=378:2></a> I do not believe, however, that it is Paul or Barnabas who relates this fact, which had happened at Jerusalem.<a name=378:3></a> The apostles and elders then meet together.<a name=378:4></a> After much disputing (for the principals, led doubtless by the Holy Ghost, were wise enough to allow all who thought themselves capable to give their opinion; and in order that after the thoughts of men the voice of God might be heard) Peter reminds the assembly how God had chosen him first to bear the gospel to the Gentiles, and that the Spirit had been given to Cornelius without his being circumcised; that God Himself had borne witness to them by the Holy Ghost just in the same way as to the believing Jews; that He had made no difference between them, purifying their hearts by faith.<a name=378:5></a> He acknowledges the yoke of the ordinances, and warns them not to tempt God by putting it on the neck of the Gentiles.<a name=378:6></a> For did not they themselves believe that they had been saved by the grace of the Lord Jesus, and not by ordinances?<a name=378:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then all the multitude kept silence, and Paul and Barnabas declared what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them.<a name=378:8></a> (Here, at Jerusalem, Barnabas is always mentioned first; it is probable that he spoke more than Paul, relating what had been done.<a name=378:9></a> Paul had laboured more than any other; but at Jerusalem it was natural that Barnabas should be more forward than Paul.<a name=378:10></a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then James, who held the first place at Jerusalem (see Acts 12: 17; 21: 18; Galatians 2: 12), gives a summary of the judgment of the assembly, which no one opposes, and, by the aid of the Holy Ghost, a definite form to the thought of God, expressing His will respecting the Gentiles.<a name=378:11></a> The work of the Holy Ghost is here in the first place remarkable; and also His full liberty, so that all the thoughts of men are brought to light, and given utterance to.<a name=378:12></a> In the next place, what God proposed to reveal by Peter in the case of Cornelius; and then the wonders that had been wrought by the hands of Barnabas and Paul among the Gentiles.<a name=378:13></a> Such is what seemed good to the Holy Ghost, who was given to Cornelius, and who wrought also among the Gentiles with signs and wonders by the hands of those who were sent out from Him.<a name=378:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then James (who, as we have seen, represented the Judaic spirit, and in whose mind the feelings of the assembly at Jerusalem concurred, but who was fully under the influence of the Holy Ghost) expresses the thought of that assembly, and of the eleven apostles of Jerusalem, whom we may call Judaic, the judgment of God on the vital question under consideration; namely, that the Gentiles should not be subject to the law of Moses.<a name=379:1></a> The word of the prophets supported this sentence, for they had declared that there should be Gentiles on whom the name of the Lord should be called.<a name=379:2></a> It is with this intention that he cites the past.<a name=379:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus the Gentiles were free.<a name=379:4></a> The things they had to observe were duties before the publication of the law.<a name=379:5></a> The worship of one God, and the purity of man, were always obligatory.<a name=379:6></a> Noah had been prohibited from eating blood, in testimony that the life belonged to God.<a name=379:7></a> These great principles are established by this decision -- the abstaining from idols -- that life belongs to God alone, purity of life in man.<a name=379:8></a> They were principles necessary for the Gentiles, and corrected their evil habits; principles recognised by the law, but which had not been distinctly laid down by it.<a name=379:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The assembly did not vote.<a name=379:10></a> All consented, under the influence of the Holy Ghost to what had been expressed.<a name=379:11></a> All agreed, apostles, elders, and the whole assembly, to send men chosen from among them to confirm by word of mouth the account of Barnabas and Paul, and the written decision which they took with them from Jerusalem.<a name=379:12></a> The apostles and elders assembled together to examine the question, but all the brethren joined with them in the letter sent to the Gentiles.<a name=379:13></a> Thus it was not the Gentiles who maintained their rights in spite of the assembly at Jerusalem, but by the wisdom and grace of God, the assembly at Jerusalem which acknowledges the liberty of the Gentiles as to the law; and unity is thus preserved.<a name=379:14></a>

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=380>[Page 380]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We may add that it was not a general, or other assembly, for it was the assembly at Jerusalem, and the apostles and elders of that city, who met together, with a few from Antioch on the part of the Gentiles, to consider the question.<a name=380:1></a> The Councils, for many centuries called "general," were convoked by the emperors to settle the disputes of the bishops: first in the east, on which occasions there were never more than six bishops present from the west; and afterwards when the Greek church separated from the Latin church, when there was no emperor from the west, councils being assembled by the popes without a single bishop from the east being present.<a name=380:2></a> These popes, without one bishop from the east, and profiting by the need of the emperor of the east who was menaced by the Turks, sought to unite the east to the west in the fifteenth century at Florence, but the attempt failed.<a name=380:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What we have here is that the apostle and the Judaic assembly, by which God had begun the work, set the Gentiles free from the law; and unity is preserved.<a name=380:4></a> We learn too how the Holy Ghost gives unity of thought concerning the questions which had arisen, since the gathering was waiting on the Lord.<a name=380:5></a> Thus is the liberty of the Holy Ghost preserved to the Gentiles, and, by the goodness of God the unity of the whole assembly maintained.<a name=380:6></a> It is declared that no commission had been given to those who had disturbed the Gentiles, subverting their souls.<a name=380:7></a> Subsequently, after much long-suffering on the part of God the Jews are called, in the Epistle to the Hebrews, to give up Judaism.<a name=380:8></a> The law and Christianity cannot be united.<a name=380:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		To suffer with patience, to sing in the midst of tribulation -- this is power; then with the same strength we can, when free, carry on the Lord's work, with like courage.<a name=393:1></a> So says the apostle, referring to such circumstances, in Thessalonians 2: 2; having been stoned and shamefully entreated at Philippi, he boldly and energetically continues to preach the gospel at Thessalonica.<a name=393:2></a> It is there we find him at this point of our narrative.<a name=393:3></a> God leads through persecution just as by all other means.<a name=393:4></a> The Apostle selects localities where there were synagogues.<a name=393:5></a> Passing through Amphipolis and Apollonia, he stops at Thessalonica; where was a synagogue.<a name=393:6></a> It was a large city, where to this day many Jews are to be found.<a name=393:7></a> "To the Jew first and also to the Greek," characterised his work.<a name=393:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In Philippi we find Satan's opposition apart from the Jews, for, though Paul had there sought the Jews also, they had no part whatever in the conflict.<a name=393:9></a> The enemy had desired to identify himself with the work of the gospel, falsifying it in order to avoid the destruction of his own power: but he does not support open opposition.<a name=393:10></a> But when the religious element is present -- that is a religion which boasts of possessing the rights conferred by God on His own on the earth, the professors of which do not submit to the truth -- this is always a source of persecution.<a name=393:11></a> In Philippi it was simply an arrogant and self-interested people who spurned all religions which spoke of the true God, as well as everything else except its own superstitions, and only sought to preserve peace under the government of Satan.<a name=393:12></a> It was the world that cast out Paul, as the Gadarenes did Jesus.<a name=393:13></a> It could endure the manifestation neither of the truth, nor of the power of God.<a name=393:14></a>

		In the narrative which follows we again find the religious element in enmity to the truth; the Jews jealous of the gospel of grace, and of the Gentiles, to whom it was announced, although the former had the first place in its administration.<a name=394:1></a> For three sabbaths Paul reasons with the Jews of Thessalonica in the synagogue, according to the custom, shewing them that it was expedient that Christ should suffer, and rise again, and that Jesus was this Christ.<a name=394:2></a> Some of the Gentiles, who worshipped the true and one God, whose need had led them to recognise Him who had revealed Himself, believed.<a name=394:3></a> They were many in number, and of the chief women not a few.<a name=394:4></a>

		The blessing of God does not fail to excite the jealousy of the Jews, and to the enmity of the human heart all means are lawful.<a name=394:5></a> Stirring up the people of the baser sort, they assault the house of Jason, seeking to bring out the servants of God, but they do not find them there.<a name=394:6></a> Jason, however, and certain other brethren they drag before the rulers of the city, accusing them of teaching doctrines opposed to the authority of Caesar, and of saying that there was another king, Jesus.<a name=394:7></a> But the rulers, troubled, it is true, with the people, were wiser than those of Philippi; for, taking security of Jason, they let them go.<a name=394:8></a> The chief culprits, Paul and his companions, not being found, were not there; and the brethren, finding the door shut for the moment against the work, send Paul and Silas to Berea, a neighbouring city.<a name=394:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the epistles to the Thessalonians (1 Thessalonians 2: 14), where also the apostle speaks of the state of the Jews (2 Thessalonians 1: 4), it appears that immediately after the apostle's departure, a violent persecution sprang up, and that the converts suffered greatly, but remained faithful, so that their faith became celebrated everywhere.<a name=394:10></a> It was to these that the apostle wrote his two first epistles, immediately after his departure from Athens and Corinth, in order to encourage them to persevere, having sent Timothy from Athens, to know if they stood fast in the faith (1 Thessalonians 3: 1).<a name=394:11></a> In reading these epistles, and Acts 18: 6, we find that the first was written from Athens when Silas and Timothy had rejoined him (Acts 17: 15; 1 Thessalonians 1: 1).<a name=394:12></a> Then he had sent Timothy to Thessalonica, who, on his return, brings good tidings of the state of the Thessalonians.<a name=394:13></a> The first epistle is then written.<a name=394:14></a> It seems that Silas and Timothy had come back and again rejoined the apostle, when he had already left Athens and was come to Corinth; Acts 18: 5.<a name=394:15></a>

		Of this journey we have no account, but it is the proof of the tender care with which the apostle watched over the new converts, and sought to establish them in the faith and path of Christ.<a name=395:1></a> The two epistles are remarkable for the freshness and affection of the communications, of which they are full, and especially the first, for the testimony which the apostle could render to the state of the disciples.<a name=395:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It will be useful to examine for a little what the apostle taught during his short stay at Thessalonica.<a name=395:3></a> We have very little, almost nothing, of the apostle's discourses outside of the synagogue.<a name=395:4></a> At Athens he makes a speech in the Areopagus, but he does not preach.<a name=395:5></a> He preached, it is said, Jesus and the resurrection.<a name=395:6></a> Let us gather up what is said here.<a name=395:7></a> In the synagogue he maintained that Christ should suffer and rise again from among the dead; moreover, he announced the kingdom of God, because He was accused of having taught that there was another king, Jesus (chapter 20: 25).<a name=395:8></a> Short though the time was in Thessalonica, yet during his sojourn there, he had taught the disciples the coming of the Lord; which, in reading the Epistle, is perfectly clear.<a name=395:9></a> The disciples had learnt that Jesus had delivered them from the wrath to come, the resurrection, and the expectation of the Son of God from heaven; that they were called to suffer with Christ, and to walk in holiness; the coming of the Lord with fire for judgment, and that with all His saints; that they should be caught up to meet the Lord; that the man of sin should be revealed, and that the mystery of iniquity was already working, but that they were called to share the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=395:10></a> He taught salvation by the truth and by faith through the power of the Holy Ghost who sanctified them for God; and all this by grace, to those who were chosen for salvation.<a name=395:11></a> Even the peculiarities of the last days were communicated to them; 2 Thessalonians 2: 5.<a name=395:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But all this was for the disciples; only the coming of the Lord in judgment of the living -- this world -- was announced to all, and they were exhorted to flee from the wrath to come, from which Jesus was the deliverer.<a name=395:13></a> It was necessary now to announce facts known to all; but if he speaks of salvation, the person of the Lord, as also His coming, has a far greater place in his doctrine than in that of the preachers of today.<a name=395:14></a> A present salvation is clearly announced, through Christ dead for us, so that we might live with Him.<a name=395:15></a> That which was everywhere presented for salvation is described with much simplicity and clearness in 1 Corinthians 15: 1-11, Christ put to death for our sins, buried, and raised up the third day.<a name=395:16></a> But here also the facts hold a greater place than now.<a name=395:17></a> We reason on the value of the facts, and this is necessary; but the more the facts are put in evidence, the more will the preaching be powerful.<a name=395:18></a>

		While the people are occupied with Jason, Paul sets out for Berea, and with undiminished courage enters into the synagogue of that city.<a name=396:1></a> Here the grace of God is manifestly with him, to dispose the hearts of the Jews to listen, and to search the word, and many believe.<a name=396:2></a> But the unhappy Jews carry on their work, and come from Thessalonica, to stir up the people against Paul and the others.<a name=396:3></a> It is mournful to see their permanent hatred to the gospel.<a name=396:4></a> But it is ever thus with an old religion set aside by truth which its professors will not receive.<a name=396:5></a>

		Now at Athens the sight of the idolatry ardently practised in that city pressed heavily on the spirit of the apostle.<a name=396:8></a> He reasons in the synagogue with the Jews, and daily in the market with them that met with him.<a name=396:9></a> Athens had been a city famous for the glory of its arts and of its arms, and for its schools of philosophy.<a name=396:10></a> Having succumbed to the Roman yoke, it had lost its importance, and lived in idleness, seeking for some new thing, still philosophising, and boasting in the memory of its ancient glory in pagan philosophy, surpassed perhaps by that of Alexandria and Tarsus (where Paul himself had been educated), although where the leaders of Roman society studied.<a name=396:11></a> The fruit was not great in this vain and idle city, but the instruction for us is precious.<a name=396:12></a>

		The apostle's discourse at the Areopagus was not the preaching of the gospel.<a name=396:13></a> It was his apology before an ancient tribunal whose decisions had, in times gone by, possessed great weight, but which then, though still allowed to exist, no longer retained its ancient importance.<a name=396:14></a> But the fact that the apostle was obliged to present himself before the tribunal, gave him the opportunity of manifesting the wisdom and grace he possessed through the Spirit of God.<a name=396:15></a> As we have seen he preached in the synagogue at Antioch in Pisidia.<a name=396:16></a> In the market-place, where the philosophers and townspeople met together, he announced Jesus and the resurrection, His person, His victory over death, the testimony that God had accepted the sacrifice of Christ, and moreover that in Him we are admitted into a new creation (a position which Adam, even in innocence, never occupied) the kingdom of the second, of the last Adam.<a name=396:17></a>

		I do not say that all these points were unfolded, but the apostle announced the grand foundations on which all these truths are built up.<a name=397:1></a> He did so according to the need and capacity of his hearers; and nobody is so incapable as a philosopher, and those under his influence and who walk in the vain thought of being something, when in reality they are nothing, and such was the true character of the Athenians.<a name=397:2></a> Knowledge is blinding.<a name=397:3></a> Human intelligence does not know God.<a name=397:4></a> God enters the conscience when He speaks in order to make Himself known; and in proportion to the pretension of the human mind to intelligence, is the hardness and inaction of the conscience.<a name=397:5></a> It is as though dead, and man as though he had none, and therefore no capacity to receive the truth whereby he may know God.<a name=397:6></a> These wise men thought that Jesus and the resurrection were gods, so far were they from the truth.<a name=397:7></a> The mind of man, and the activity of his intelligence, when it is a question of morality and of God, can do nothing but always drive him farther and farther away.<a name=397:8></a> He finds no basis for morality, and consequently no true rule; and when God is submitted to the human understanding, He is no longer God in any sense.<a name=397:9></a> God does not present Himself to man in order to know what he ought to be.<a name=397:10></a> Conscience and faith put God in His own place, and man in his true relation to God; and the word is the means of doing so, the word in which God reveals Himself, and shews what man is.<a name=397:11></a>

		Some mocked the apostle, saying, "What will this babbler say?<a name=397:12></a>" Ridicule is often a means in the hands of the enemy to turn away souls from the truth, because men are afraid to identify themselves with what others despise.<a name=397:13></a> Conscience and moral courage are the very last things to be found in the heart of man: grace awakens conscience, and gives strength to follow it.<a name=397:14></a> Still here was something new; and that was always enough for the Athenians, fatigued by the nonentity of their existence.<a name=397:15></a> Accordingly they lead Paul to the Areopagus, once honourable and honoured, in order to know what this new doctrine might be.<a name=397:16></a> Because however frivolous philosophical opinions may be, they cannot quietly endure either truth or Christ.<a name=397:17></a> One human opinion may be as good as another; but the testimony of God operates on the conscience, and demands the heart.<a name=397:18></a>

		Paul, surely taught by the Holy Ghost, replies in the Areopagus with admirable wisdom, and a calm love which lays hold on the sole circumstance to which he could attach the truth he desired to communicate to them.<a name=398:1></a> His practised eye had observed in the city the only little remnant of truth by which he could lead them to recognise their true position.<a name=398:2></a> It was not simply a declaration of the salvation of the soul, which had already occupied him in the synagogue and public market-place; here he explains the true character of the religion of idols, but with perfect delicacy; and seeks to bind that remnant of truth which the enemy had not been able to destroy, with truth more positive, with the name of Jesus, and with that which appealed to the conscience.<a name=398:3></a>

		The people of the city, idle and at heart sceptical, were given up to idolatry; and, the circle of the gods being exhausted, they had dedicated an altar to the unknown God.<a name=398:4></a> It is said that in former times a fatal malady had reigned in the city; and that the inhabitants, having prayed in vain to all the gods to remove the plague, had consulted an oracle, who directed them to dedicate an altar to the unknown God.<a name=398:5></a> It is unnecessary, however, to seek for any special source of this worship.<a name=398:6></a> At the bottom of all idolatry there is the idea of God, corrupted, and taken possession of by Satan, so that men may worship demons; but the idea cannot be eradicated from the heart of man.<a name=398:7></a> Infidels seek to do so, but it always remains at the bottom of the heart, in spite of all their efforts.<a name=398:8></a> It is born with the birth of man, and creation bears witness too clear and too strong to allow the heart to believe that everything was made by nothing.<a name=398:9></a> And then conscience speaks too loud to allow it to be unhearkened to.<a name=398:10></a> Man does not want God and tries to forget Him; he reasons, and seeks diversions; but the thought always returns, and possibility makes itself felt.<a name=398:11></a> He endeavours to get rid of the thought by every means, but still it is always there; and the thought of God always makes us feel guilty.<a name=398:12></a>

		God is to be found in all idolatries, neglected and forgotten, it is true; but He exists in all mythologies, and is found in the conscience when awakened by fear.<a name=399:1></a> When men are in agony (so says a Christian of pagan times) they do not say, "Oh, immortal gods!<a name=399:2></a>" but "Oh God!<a name=399:3></a> a proof, I would add, of a soul naturally Christian.<a name=399:4></a>" They made great gods and little gods, placed a god or a goddess at fountains, in woods, and wherever they could see the operations of nature; but behind everything remained the deep feeling that there was one only and all-powerful God.<a name=399:5></a> Thus among the Brahmins in India, in Egypt, among the Sabeans, among the Scandinavians, there were gods without end, yet one God not worshipped but owned as the source of everything.<a name=399:6></a> This God, the Author of all, rested in darkness.<a name=399:7></a> In India not a single temple was ever dedicated to him, but still He exists and is the source of everything.<a name=399:8></a> Among the Sabeans, the ancient Persians, there was another kind of pagan religion which recognised Ahrim and Ahrmasda, a bad and a good god, and in which God was worshipped in fire, and which had no idol; there was another god as the source of these.<a name=399:9></a> I say source, because a creation was not owned among the pagans.<a name=399:10></a> See Hebrews 11: 3.<a name=399:11></a>

		The imagination, under the influence of Satan, created gods everywhere, but at the bottom the idea of God was there.<a name=399:12></a> And yet this God, the true, was unknown -- deplorable state of mankind, deprived of God, of whom they stood in such deep need!<a name=399:13></a> thus enemies to His true knowledge, because the conscience, which makes responsibility felt, could not endure His presence, because the heart desired things which the conscience in the presence of God condemned.<a name=399:14></a> They made gods who would help men to gratify their passions.<a name=399:15></a> Man cannot suffice to himself; he has lost God, and fears Him; his heart stoops to that which is more degraded than himself.<a name=399:16></a> He seeks, but in vain, to satisfy the need of his heart by means of objects which degrade him, and make him forget God, of whom the thought is anguish to his heart.<a name=399:17></a>

		God, the unknown God, now reveals Himself; and the apostle, with great happiness of thought laying hold of the inscription on the altar, announces the true God whom they did not know.<a name=399:18></a> This is not the gospel; but he identifies the God he had already preached in the gospel of Jesus and of the resurrection with the truth they themselves admitted, and, defending it, speaks to the conscience.<a name=399:19></a> The unknown God would judge the world by this Jesus, in that He had raised Him from the dead.<a name=399:20></a> This truth he applies to their conscience and to idolatry, under the yoke of which they were subjected.<a name=399:21></a> By the power of the Spirit in Paul they stood accused, convicted of having falsified the idea of God and denied His glory, the glory of the only Creator, for they had only recognised Him by the confession that He was unknown.<a name=399:22></a>

		Such was the apostle's defence; not of himself, truly; but he brings his hearers into the presence of God, and sets forth that which the conscience could not deny, and that this was what they ought to have known (Romans 1: 19, 20).<a name=400:8></a> Then he reveals what was new, namely, that judgment was approaching, that it was to be executed by the Man established by God, of whom He had given assurance, in raising Him from the dead, as the public proof of His ways and power, which ended the path of man on earth, and overthrew the power of Satan.<a name=400:9></a> The accusers receive their own sentence To the existence of God they say nothing, but many mock at the idea of resurrection.<a name=400:10></a>

		This became still more remarkable when others, who pretended to cast out demons, undertook to make use of the name of Jesus.<a name=406:9></a> This placed the reality of the Lord's power over that of the devil in the clearest light.<a name=406:10></a> Certain Jews sought to profit by the power of the name of Jesus preached by Paul, but without having faith in His person.<a name=406:11></a> But the devil knew well with whom he had to do.<a name=406:12></a> He knew Jesus, and did not dare to resist Him; and he also well knew that Paul was His servant.<a name=406:13></a> But under what pretence did these unbelievers exercise authority over the power of the devil?<a name=406:14></a> The man possessed by the devil rises up against these Jews, and drives them out, so that they flee from the house naked and wounded.<a name=406:15></a>

		The power of God in Paul is seen in three ways: first, the Spirit is communicated by the laying on of his hands; second, very wonderful miracles; third, the devils themselves are forced to own the power of His word, and the authority of Paul, when he makes use of the name of Jesus; and they make a difference between him and those who under false pretences employ that name.<a name=407:11></a> This was soon known by all, Greeks and Jews, and they were filled with fear.<a name=407:12></a> It moreover works on the conscience of the believers, who come and confess their deeds, bringing the books of their curious arts, for which Ephesus was celebrated, and burning them before all to the value of fifty thousand pieces of silver.<a name=407:13></a> When God reveals Himself in power, the heart opens before Him, and confesses sincerely all that the conscience knows, doing so openly for His glory.<a name=407:14></a> This is a special effect of the manifestation of His power.<a name=407:15></a> Man thinks no longer of himself, or of his shame, but is overcome by the presence of God.<a name=407:16></a>

		It seems to us, then, that the death of Paul is the moment from which we must count the prevalence of evil.<a name=421:8></a> We say "prevalence," because evil was already working, though Paul resisted it by the power of the Spirit; and because this evil was to go on increasing till Christ should come; because in the last days perilous time should come, and the form of godliness without the power of it.<a name=421:9></a> Then in 2 Timothy 3 we also get the word of God set forth as that which is necessary, and sufficient to render the man of God perfect, and furnished unto all good works.<a name=421:10></a> All this truth is powerfully confirmed by what is said in Revelation 2 and 3, where the Christian who has ears to hear is called upon to hearken, not to the church, but to what the Spirit saith unto the church; and in His words we find judgment pronounced by Jesus Christ on the state of the church.<a name=421:11></a>

		We would add that it is one thing to submit to the discipline, or practical judgment of an assembly, regarding evil, and quite another thing to suppose, when we are called upon to judge of the state of the church by the words of Christ and of the Spirit, that the authority of the assembly is the perpetual safeguard of the faith.<a name=422:1></a> The universal assembly, Christianity, is corrupted and divided, and cannot, even as an instrument in the hands of God, secure the maintenance of the truth.<a name=422:2></a> It is submission to the word of God only that can do it.<a name=422:3></a>

		In order to shew how far the primitive church wandered from the truth, we shall quote from a book read in the assembly, one hundred and fifty years after the death of John, cited by one of the best fathers of the primitive churches as part of the inspired scriptures, and esteemed as such by another, who was less orthodox, it is true.<a name=422:4></a>

		From Miletus, Paul sets out for Jerusalem.<a name=424:1></a> In this journey, nothing of importance occurs till the apostle's arrival at Tyre.<a name=424:2></a> There he finds disciples who tell him not to go up to Jerusalem; and this they do by the Spirit.<a name=424:3></a> We have already spoken a little of this.<a name=424:4></a> To tell him by the Spirit not to go up was more than to forewarn him that bonds and tribulation awaited him.<a name=424:5></a> He felt bound in spirit, and doubtless the hand of God was leading him, though it was not that free action of the Holy Ghost in his heart that had guided him in the Lord's work.<a name=424:6></a> He means by the state of his soul as a victim, and by this providence, not to preach to lost souls in order to save them, but to bear testimony to the Lord in the face of death.<a name=424:7></a> In such a testimony he answers for himself, and therefore for the Lord; but he was not seeking souls.<a name=424:8></a> He does nothing hurtful, but he does not work in the power of the Holy Ghost.<a name=424:9></a> To him the Lord Himself was everything.<a name=424:10></a> That was not changed; and the circumstances in which the apostle is found during these last years of his life resemble those in which the Lord was placed at Jerusalem.<a name=424:11></a> But in Him we see perfection in man; in Paul the grace of God with man, but man in his imperfection was not doing that work now.<a name=424:12></a> He was going to Jerusalem with money from the Greeks for the poor saints who lived there -- a good Christian work, but not the apostolic work of the gospel.<a name=424:13></a> He could not bear witness as an apostle at Jerusalem.<a name=424:14></a> The Lord had told him so.<a name=424:15></a> Still as a prisoner he had a testimony, and the Lord was with him: and also towards those who had not otherwise heard the gospel, such as the governors and kings.<a name=424:16></a>

		It is true that he followed afar off in the Lord's footsteps, being betrayed by the Jews, and placed by them with Gentiles to be put to death; but his true work as an apostle to the Gentiles was at an end, at least as far as we know from the word.<a name=425:1></a> We have seen that there is a certain difference between "they said to him by the Spirit," and "the Spirit said.<a name=425:2></a>" If the Spirit Himself had said it, it would have been disobedience to Paul to have gone to Jerusalem: but it seems to us that it was rather a warning given by the Spirit, that he should not go there.<a name=425:3></a> Certainly it was much more than to say that afflictions awaited him.<a name=425:4></a> It was a solemn warning from the Spirit by the mouths of the brethren; and moreover he was "bound in spirit.<a name=425:5></a>" But this warning the apostle neglects.<a name=425:6></a> He feels constrained to go to Jerusalem, but notwithstanding this, he is led by the providence and grace of God manifest towards him, faithful and blessed.<a name=425:7></a>

		Here we must draw the distinction between the apostle's service, in which he was the minister of God Himself, and guarded by the Holy Ghost, when his words were those of the Spirit conveyed by his mouth, and his individual walk when he is found in a place where he had not been sent to accomplish the work assigned to him.<a name=426:1></a> This distinction made, let us compare the path of the Lord with that of the apostle, and faithful as the latter was, mark the difference.<a name=426:2></a> The Lord, when He hears that Lazarus is sick, remains quietly for two days in the same place, and then, God's time being come, goes up to Jerusalem to do the will of His Father.<a name=426:3></a> The disciples, astonished, and fearing that death awaited Him there, warn Him, saying, "Goest thou thither again?<a name=426:4></a>" But the will of God was clear to the Lord, and therefore His path also, and He replies, "Are there not twelve hours in the day?<a name=426:5></a> If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.<a name=426:6></a>" All is calm, all is in the light of a divine day for His heart.<a name=426:7></a> The Saviour is the object of testimony, perfect in Himself.<a name=426:8></a> The apostles, however great and faithful, were only witnesses of His perfection and His glory.<a name=426:9></a> In themselves, no matter how marvellously blessed, they were only men as others.<a name=426:10></a> Paul had to reprove Peter publicly, and to separate himself from Barnabas.<a name=426:11></a> Here, conducted by the hand of God, and strengthened by His grace, he is led, bound in the spirit, to pass through circumstances that put to the test his state of soul, and brought his public career to a close.<a name=426:12></a>

		It will be worth our while to notice a few particularities in the apostle's discourse.<a name=431:18></a> The Lord still calls Himself Jesus of Nazareth.<a name=431:19></a> We know that He was glorified, but this makes Him shine with a light more brilliant than that of the sun.<a name=431:20></a> He is ever the same benign and gentle Man who learned human sorrows in the midst of men.<a name=431:21></a> He thinks of others, and considers all Christians as part of Himself.<a name=431:22></a> "I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.<a name=431:23></a>" Infinitely precious truth!<a name=431:24></a> Then we find in Paul the same liberty as we have seen in Ananias.<a name=431:25></a> He reasons with the Lord (verse 18-21), saying that more than any other he was fit for testimony at Jerusalem.<a name=431:26></a> And this makes his sincerity evident.<a name=431:27></a> Yet in this he might perceive the Lord's wisdom, for he is bearing witness against his own presence at Jerusalem.<a name=431:28></a> And here too we see what a perfect conscience is, by grace and by the blood of Christ.<a name=431:29></a> He recounts to Christ all his sins, and the hatred which at the beginning had been in his heart to the Lord's name; how he had persecuted the members of Christ, and taken part in the death of Stephen; and all this he presents to the Lord as a motive for his mission to the Jews.<a name=431:30></a> But his conscience was pure now.<a name=431:31></a>

		Here again we discover the apostle's nearness to God, his intimacy with Him, and the Lord's abundant grace towards His servant; and through this communion, Paul becomes master of the situation.<a name=442:1></a> On the authority of God, he is able to forewarn the sailors and captain of the vessel what is to happen.<a name=442:2></a> But this revelation was expressed in general terms, and the centurion placed more confidence in the owner and pilot than in what Paul said.<a name=442:3></a> To him, this was a mere human prediction.<a name=442:4></a> And when the south wind blew softly, they thought they had gained their desire of reaching Phenice.<a name=442:5></a> But God holds the winds in the hollow of His hand.<a name=442:6></a> The soft and favourable wind that tempted them to set sail, did not continue; and soon a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon, which blows from Greece, and even more from the east, sprang up, and drove them towards the south-west, threatening to cast them on the quicksands of Africa, which lay almost in the direction in which the wind was driving them.<a name=442:7></a> After much difficulty, they succeeded in getting the boat on board, but this after all, proved useless in saving them.<a name=442:8></a> God was not willing that the many souls in the vessel should be saved by human means, but that Paul's word should be accomplished, and he himself be the occasion of the safety of all.<a name=442:9></a>
