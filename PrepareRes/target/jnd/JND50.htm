		DEAREST BRETHREN AND SISTERS [at Plymouth], -- Grace and peace be to you, and mercy from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=1:1></a> I cannot write to you altogether as I could wish, for though my heart should flow out towards you all as it does before God, I write with some restraint, for though but slightly ill in itself, yet constant walking on hot sunny flags in a town, relaxes and weakens my eye.<a name=1:2></a> I feel, brethren, deeply, all your love towards me, and rejoice to feel it, not for my own sake only, though it has been comfort and refreshment to me, and put thus something of a new feature on my christian life, nor yet for your sakes, dear brethren, only, though I rejoice in it yet more abundantly for that, but yet more because our common Master is honoured, and He rejoices in the prosperity of His people.<a name=1:3></a> He must delight in their love, for "he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God.<a name=1:4></a>" He must delight in the manifestation of the Father, as He says, "that they may be one in us -- made perfect in one.<a name=1:5></a>" And I beseech you, the rather, brethren, earnestly to maintain this spirit of love, which is the presence of God.<a name=1:6></a> I rejoice, exceedingly, that I have any fellowship with you in it.<a name=1:7></a> I know, brethren, that we all have it in great weakness, but though -- brethren, I have felt it the rather, because, though I have met with abundant individual kindness, and many dear children of God, yet I have not met the children of God dwelling together so much in unity, but have been a man of contentions rather.<a name=1:8></a> God is my witness whether I loved it or not.<a name=1:9></a> But it has made me the more anxious that you should bear witness to the power of the principle, yea, of the healing power of God -- I mean, in love.<a name=1:10></a> For the disease of sin is separating, and God is uniting, for He is love; and this will be the healing of all things, for they are to be gathered together into one in Christ.<a name=1:11></a> Some now of His sheep are scattered abroad.<a name=1:12></a> Walk then in love, dear brethren, and you will walk in power, and in the glory of God.<a name=1:13></a>

		I did rejoice for your sakes, that you sent, as I learned, the money to poor Mrs.<a name=1:14></a> -- -- (and indeed, it was greatly needed, for he, having served the Lord in his generation, had left simply nothing, and a sickly family): as you had all known him, I meant to have mentioned him to you, but need I say how much happier I was that it came unmentioned?<a name=1:15></a> and it bore witness to your love here, and to the power of it amongst you, and as the blessed apostle says, did not make me ashamed in my boasting of you, so that I was the rather rejoiced.<a name=1:16></a> We have done what we could here also.<a name=1:17></a> And, dear brethren, how shall I thank you for all your kindness to me and care of me?<a name=1:18></a> I felt to the utmost some of your provision for me, that I might not destroy the memorials of your kindness, but I knew this would be hardly meeting it, and I bear witness to your kindness in it amongst our brethren here.<a name=1:19></a>

		The brethren who meet in Aungier Street are going on in much unity and sweetness of spirit amongst each other.<a name=1:20></a> I should only fear their getting too comfortable amongst themselves, and sitting quietly down, but they all labour in the Lord as far as I know.<a name=1:21></a> In the Bridewell, where cholera broke out, and the first cases very virulent, the matron, a sister, sent for some of them to pray, and they did, and all, when I last heard, were recovering.<a name=1:22></a> Two out of them have died here of those attacked, though the number of these are comparatively, under God, few.<a name=1:23></a> A good spirit seems shewn about it, but the people are enraged, and the doctors are in consternation, as far as I see, as to their feeling about themselves.<a name=1:24></a> The hand of the Lord is manifest; there have, I find, been two cases of persons recovering under prayer here: in the second, the attending physician requested it might be done, in consequence of the former case, which he had been attending; and medicine was relinquished, and the person grew better -- as far as I collected, it was gradual.<a name=1:25></a>

		Dear brethren, stand fast; and, I beseech you, to abound in the work of the Lord, and by well-doing, put to silence the ignorance of foolish men.<a name=1:26></a> I am persuaded, that what I have seen published about you, did not affect the weakest among you.<a name=1:27></a> Remember the word, "being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it: being defamed we entreat; we are made as filth of the earth, as the offscouring of all things unto this day.<a name=1:28></a>" If you are called Beelzebub, you well know why you should bear it, returning blessing for cursing.<a name=1:29></a> It is a privilege we have little of, to be like our Master.<a name=1:30></a> For the rest, brethren, be wise, be steady, and throwing everything upon the Lord, and the peace of God shall be with you, which is more, far more, than the reproach of the world.<a name=1:31></a> Try all things, and hold fast that which is good.<a name=1:32></a>

		I am detained here awhile, hoping, if it may be, that something may be done, by which the Bible Society may be kept, or rather, the service of God kept up in it; if it be done, you shall hear all about it.<a name=1:33></a> Dear brethren, in the midst of abundant kindness here, often the countenances of many dear christian friends at Plymouth, shine across my path, with only increased feelings of kindness and pleasure.<a name=1:34></a> I do trust in the Lord, to see you again shortly; it will be a little longer than I hoped, partly from my eye, and partly because I cannot move others as fast as my wishes.<a name=1:35></a> But my heart is with you, dear brethren, and I long to see you all.<a name=1:36></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Forgive me my harassed letter, arising from over working, as usual a little beyond my strength.<a name=1:37></a> I probably, if the Lord will, shall get a week's rest of body on my way to the West, and after I have seen them there, my mind will begin to revert to Plymouth, though many have reproached me with deserting this country.<a name=1:38></a> I seek only the Lord's will in it.<a name=1:39></a> Grace be with you, dear brethren and sisters in the Lord.<a name=1:40></a>

		[to Plymouth from Ireland] Dear -- , I saw so little of you, from various circumstances, while I was at Plymouth, that I the rather take occasion to write to you, though I steal twenty minutes from the toil of one of our day's meetings.<a name=4:1></a> I am anxious, too, to say a few words about my most dear brethren at Plymouth, and to express my love to them.<a name=4:2></a> The Lord has been, I think <i>very</i> graciously with us here, not <i>more</i> gracious than He would ever be (but more than our hearts draw Him down, through our stupidness), for His presence is always blessing; but He has restrained, brought out unanimity, and shewn also a power of His Spirit, in bringing out our minds long apparently hedged in, which is to me quite marvellous.<a name=4:3></a> In fact, those things which I have been labouring for in sorrow (partly, I dare say, through my own fault) these years, are now bursting forth in this country, so that I would think that six years had passed since I was last here, so as to meet many from different parts.<a name=4:4></a> Though everything is comparatively to be done, it is turning perforce into a missionary country; the character of its state is quite different from in England.<a name=4:5></a>

		It will be impossible to give you any sketch of the matter here,<a href="#4:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> from the immense quantity -- not compared with scripture, for it indeed proved our ignorance, but with our individual thoughts: very much of most important matter as to the man of sin, his deceivableness and power, and the power and working of Satan, and of the Spirit, and the opposition of the two, and the Lord's judgments, and as associated with our present prospects, was drawn with the greatest profit.<a name=4:6></a> At least, I so felt it; this to me was the most interesting part, but what interested me was the way it was mixed with faith.<a name=4:7></a> There was also marked and universal (I may say almost) reference to the Spirit; it characterised in a peculiar way, I think, what was set forth, so as to shew the Lord's hand.<a name=4:8></a> We had (a few of us brethren, more immediately known and together) prayer together, morning and afternoon, which helped us much, at least, ourselves; and doubtless, the Lord accepted us; and I found it a great blessing to my own soul in the matter.<a name=4:9></a> God's presence and Spirit has, I think, been very graciously with us.<a name=4:10></a> I think also, light was thrown (not perhaps quite so bright, but I think there was) on Daniel and the Apocalypse, and other books of scripture.<a name=4:11></a> I do pray the Lord may be yet with us, and keep the flesh down.<a name=4:12></a> I wish you had been with us; I am sure you would have enjoyed it.<a name=4:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord has been most abundantly gracious to you at Plymouth.<a name=4:14></a> I pray God to keep you from everything which will not stand the large, all-embracing love, and purity of His coming.<a name=4:15></a> I do feel exceedingly anxious as to this: I trust dear H.<a name=4:16></a> may be the means of keeping you, for I know it is near his heart, in all largeness of heart; and you, dear brother, as the rest, ought to know, with all that join and visit amongst you, and are in the habit of sitting down with you all, that no root of bitterness spring up among you, and that none in any wise fail of the grace of God.<a name=4:17></a> This is the true secret of a church well ordered, perfect largeness of heart, as large as Christ's even at His coming, and full consideration of one another to provoke to love and to good works, and that Satan get no entrance or defilement.<a name=4:18></a> I beseech you all to watch for this with all the love in which I mention it, that it may be so; surely it is your blessing and privilege.<a name=4:19></a> I do trust the young ones of the flock are going on well, and are cheered by every considerateness of their state, that nothing should stumble them (would the Lord own you all as a faithful and wise steward?<a name=4:20></a>), and that they in meekness and love are anxious and prompt to learn and to receive of the Lord what He may give.<a name=4:21></a> And, dear brother, are you working and watching after the poor souls in K.<a name=4:22></a> Street?<a name=4:23></a> I do feel very anxious about them, and walking in love with one another.<a name=4:24></a>

		There were some questions in Miss -- 's letter which I anxiously looked concerning, but the Lord gave me no answer to give, and I thought I saw why: He was teaching in another way what I could not.<a name=4:25></a> The Lord sent us a blessing, and disposed the hearts of the saints much towards us at Bristol, and many also to hear.<a name=4:26></a> We preached in both chapels.<a name=4:27></a> The Lord is doing a very marked work there, in which I hope our dear brothers M.<a name=4:28></a> and C.<a name=4:29></a> may be abundantly blessed, but I should wish a little more principle of largeness of communion.<a name=4:30></a> I dread narrowness of heart more than anything for the church of Christ, <i>especially now</i>.<a name=4:31></a>

		I was arrested in my progress, and now write from the end of Westmeath, being on an important preaching tour, in which we are seeking to bring missionary truth, and I hope more, to bear on a large surface of this country.<a name=4:32></a> It is important as introducing lay-preaching, and turning the country into a missionary country; indeed, the importance of watching this country is daily more pressed upon me, that the required service of the Lord, so far as may be, may be fulfilled.<a name=4:33></a> I lean upon the freeness and power of the Spirit of God.<a name=4:34></a> I shall be detained some time in this country I see, but I hope I shall be able to prove to you when I return to Plymouth, that I have not been idle.<a name=4:35></a>

		My present tour embraces Meath, Enniskillen, Armagh, Trim (if you can find them), having two or three places per diem, to investigate or preach in, in the space of a fortnight.<a name=4:36></a> There are, of course, difficulties in the way, and I do not know that I have the onwardness of manner suited to it, but I shall be able to report for them who may follow.<a name=4:37></a> On the whole, I have reason to be thankful in this country.<a name=4:38></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#4:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>It may be of interest to insert here the following account of the second meeting, for the consideration of subjects connected with Prophecy, held at Powerscourt House, from September 24th to 28th, 1832, at which this letter was commenced, with a list of the subjects. A comparison with the brief notice in the letter itself, suggests that it was from Mr. Darby's pen. It was addressed to the Editor of the Christian Herald, in which there is a Review of the Revelation W. Burgh's Lectures on the Second Advent, by Mr. Darby. (See Collected Writings, vol. 33, page 1.) (The first Powerscourt meeting was held on October 4th to 7th, 1831.) <p>To the Editor of the Christian Herald. <p>Dear Sir, -- If done with the delicacy due to a private house, the importance of the subject, and its association with that which so intimately affects the church, may justify some notice of the meeting held on the subject of Prophecy, and the truths connected with it, at Powerscourt. I shall venture, therefore, to send you some account of it, praying the Lord's blessing upon it; as, for my part, I feel very strongly its importance. <p>It would be, of course, impossible to go at large into the several subjects which were handled there; I shall endeavour merely to convey to you some character of the meeting. There were a number of Clergy, and several of the Laity, whose minds had been exercised on these subjects; and the Revelation Robert Daly, Rector of Powerscourt, as on a former occasion, unless casually absent, presided. The subjects you will be enabled to state below, should you feel it an object to your readers. The solemnity which characterised the meeting was broken only in a single instance, which needs only to be mentioned for the sake of truth. There was, besides at the opening and closing of each morning and evening assembly, much prayer made elsewhere for the meeting, and this even in England; and the remarkable recognition of the Spirit, I mean practically, was very striking; and, it appears to the writer, met by a restraint on the thoughts and feelings of man, which, considering the variety of the subjects, was very remarkable -- more so even than the elucidation of scripture which was afforded. It appeared to the writer that the progress in knowledge and exposition of scripture was decided, but the practical apprehension of the subjects treated, yet more so. There was, of course, variety of view in so large an assemblage, but scarce anything which did not positively add to the information of all -- subject, of course, to the correction which interchange of views ever brings, where there is unity in the general scope. There was but one individual who introduced anything which could have given pain to any on these subjects; and that was a reference to the reception of "the gifts" and the principles connected with it. Little, however, was said upon it; and while the principles were calmly inquired into by a few, it did not, I think, affect the meeting, otherwise than to direct the earnest desires and prayers of many, for the more abundant presence of that Holy Ghost, by which alone, error can be brought to light, and the believer guided into all truth. On the whole, this part of the meeting was, perhaps, the most practically profitable, from the elucidation of the doctrine of the Holy Spirit casually drawn out by it; and the presiding presence of the Holy Spirit most marked, by a careful observer; and several defective and erroneous views prevalent (to the writer's knowledge) in England, met by what appeared to be scriptural light. <p>The belief in the coming of a personal Antichrist was common, and that amongst many who, at a former meeting, had not received it at all; in this there was a very distinct and avowed change of opinion on the part of some. The discussion of the subject of Antichrist led to an extensive development of scripture, and to much very profitable detection of the spirit by which he might work in the nations; though no definite conclusion was come to upon this; while the recognition of his actings amongst the Jews, in Jerusalem, was more definitely recognised by those more conversant with the subject. <p>On Daniel a good deal of light was thrown, and though there was some, I think not so much, perhaps, upon the Revelation; though particular parts of it were discussed with considerable accession of knowledge. There was some very interesting inquiry as to the quotation of the Old Testament in the New; particularly on the point, whether there was any "accommodation," or whether they were quoted according to the mind of the Spirit in the Old; this gave occasion to some very interesting development of scripture. The progress of the Antichristian powers was very fully discussed. <p>This will give you, after all, but a very imperfect idea of the meeting. Even as to the extent of scriptural information brought forward, while it left the additional impression of how much yet remained to be understood of blessing and of truth, and left upon the minds of many a highly increased degree of value for the privilege of the word of God, many, I am sure, were humbled, and many refreshed; while light was afforded also to many, on points which are exercising the christian world so universally at the present day. <p>That all was perfect there, Sir, I suppose none there would be disposed to think; but this certainly struck the writer, how remarkably, as he has stated, the Spirit restrained, while it left the strengthened consciousness of all the imperfection and weakness which exists among us; and I think those in the church, who are really in earnest, must most deeply feel, on the whole, that, spread as that assembly will be over the country, the meeting was one of deep interest to the church of God at large. In the discussion on so many subjects, and many relating so much to the practical position in which Christians are, it cannot be doubted that the views advanced by some may have given pain to a few; but the effect, on the whole, was to knit, in the deepest interests of the church of Christ, the affections of many believers, and to unite them in the surest tie with each other; while the sense of the difficulties in which the church is now placed, would lead them individually (under God) to more earnest seeking the guidance and presence of God's Spirit, and that blessing upon the church, and presence of God's power with it, by which alone it can be brought, in the honour of Christ, through the perilous times in which it is now placed. <p>I remain, dear Sir, <br>Yours faithfully, X. <p>*Subjects for Consideration at the Meeting above referred to*. <p>*Monday Evening, Six o'clock*, September 24th, 1832. -- An examination into the quotations given in the New Testament from the Old, with their connections and explanations, viz.: -- Matthew 1: 23, Is. 7: 14; Matthew 2: 15, Hosea 11: 1; Matthew 2: 18, Jeremiah 31: 15; Matthew 11: 10, 14, Malachi 3: 1, 4: 5; Matthew 21: 16, Hebrews 2: 6, Psalm 8: 2; Matthew 24: 15, Daniel 9: 27; Matthew 27: 9, Zechariah 11: 12, 13; Ephesians 4: 8, Psalm 68: 18; Hebrews 2: 13, Isaiah 8: 18; Hebrews 8: 8, Jeremiah 31: 31-34; Hebrews 10: 16, Jeremiah 31: 33; Luke 1: 73, Genesis 22: 16; John 10: 34, Psalm 82: 6; John 19: 37, Zechariah 12: 10; Acts 2: 17, Isaiah 44: 3, Joel 2: 25; Acts 15: 16, Amos 9: 11, 12; Romans 9: 25, Hosea 2: 23, 1: 10; Romans 10: 5, 6, Leviticus 18: 5, Deuteronomy 30: 13; 1 Corinthians 9: 9, 1 Timothy 5: 18, Deuteronomy 25: 4; 1 Corinthians 15: 55, Hosea 13: 14; Galatians 4: 27, Isaiah 54: 1; 2 Peter 3: 13, Isaiah 65: 17, 66: 22. <p>Tuesday. -- The Prophetical character of each book in the Bible; including the three great feasts of the Jews, the blessings pronounced on Jacob's sons, the Parables in the Gospel, and the Epistles to the Seven Churches in Revelation. <p>*Wednesday*. -- Should we expect a personal Antichrist? If so, to whom will he be revealed? Are there to be one or two great evil powers in the world at that time? Is there any uniform sense for the word *Saint* in the Prophetic, or New Testament scripture? By what covenant did the Jews, and shall the Jews, hold the land? <p>*Thursday*. -- An inquiry into, and a connection between Daniel and the Apocalypse. <p>*Friday*. -- What light does scripture throw on present events, and their moral character? What is next to be looked for and expected? Is there a prospect of a revival of Apostolic churches before the coming of Christ? What the duties arising out of present events? To what time, and to what class of persons do 1 Timothy 4; 2 Timothy 3; Jude; Matthew 24: 23, 24; and 2 Peter 3 refer?

		DEAREST BROTHER, -- I meant to have written to you before; it is relief to me to write to you now, bearing as I do our dear brethren at Plymouth upon my heart, while I do so, for while I have been much blessed, yet I find incessant intercourse with men distracts me in my weakness of communion.<a name=9:1></a> I was very thankful to get your letter indeed, in the midst of many anxious services which every one working the Lord's work now must have.<a name=9:2></a> The order and peace of Plymouth is one of my comforts here; I do trust the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, my God, will keep them ever, and I am persuaded He will, walking in good works, and abounding therein with thanksgiving, in humbleness of heart that God thus undeservedly blesses us all.<a name=9:3></a> I do pray He may make them all a pattern of believers, yet growing themselves into deep and brighter conformity to Christ, having Him ever before their eyes, and [leading]<a href="#9:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> also young and old in Christ into the depth of the riches of His grace.<a name=9:4></a> I do remember you -- in weakness in my prayer, yet in my measure of faith that it may be so, and trust it may be according to the measure of His goodness, and not any man's weakness -- that you <i>grow</i> in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ, and none fall in any wise from their own stedfastness.<a name=9:5></a> May the Lord keep you all.<a name=9:6></a> May the Lord give you peace, always, and by all means, from Himself.<a name=9:7></a>

		I can tell you for watchfulness, dear brethren, as well as comfort, that your report, whether of weakness or strength, is gone out, so take heed that you walk very close with the Lord.<a name=9:8></a> The last place I heard of H -- was in the County Clare, in a newspaper .<a name=9:9></a>.<a name=9:10></a>.<a name=9:11></a> with no great honour, but that, of course, we may all expect from the world.<a name=9:12></a> It assumes to my mind daily more importance, and that which therefore more immediately presses on my mind is, that they may be all kept in humbleness -- great humbleness, that they may walk in God's righteousness and true holiness by the power of the Spirit dwelling amongst them, granting too what He will so we honour Christ.<a name=9:13></a> Do not marvel if such things as -- 's impatience arise; Satan will try to trouble you by them.<a name=9:14></a> But if you walk in the communion of the Spirit in power in any measure, the Lord will help you through it, rebuking the flesh and the enemy in him, if indeed you be separated from it and sanctified; for then you will discern it to be of the flesh and the enemy, while you, being sanctified, will have power to repress it, giving all liberty to the Spirit, but rebuking all disorder.<a name=9:15></a> And it may be, some time there may be need to rebuke, as we learn from the blessed apostle by the Spirit.<a name=9:16></a> But the flesh cannot rebuke the flesh, nor will the flesh submit to it; but if you indeed walk in the Spirit, you have God's authority according to your measure, and Satan will yield to the Spirit, and the sanctioned witness of God's Spirit among you.<a name=9:17></a> Pray much for this Spirit; let your prayers abound for it, so shall you be able to discern all things, and the brethren shall grow up soon, unexpectedly, in all things, looking ever towards the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.<a name=9:18></a>

		My heart is with you, dear brethren, while you walk in order, and therefore was your letter such a comforter.<a name=9:19></a> You are my comfort and joy, and therefore it ought to be so with me; and, dear friends, I make my boast of you, so (as the apostle says) I hope I shall not be ashamed of the same confident boasting.<a name=9:20></a> Yea, I trust it may make you humble and ashamed of yourselves, that you are not more conformed to Christ, when men come to see your ways.<a name=9:21></a> The brethren who have met together in Clare, that is Ennis, have much followed your order at Plymouth.<a name=9:22></a> Some brethren have met here in weakness, but I trust the Lord will be with them.<a name=9:23></a> At Rathkeale they have met, and seem going on well, though in weakness.<a name=9:24></a> In Dublin, -- a brother I trust, whom you know, has troubled the body exceedingly, as he was about to do before.<a name=9:25></a> I pray God it may not produce evil, but it has thrown them into confusion: my God will bring them out of it into a brighter order and good, if they hear and learn of Him.<a name=9:26></a> I know not whether they will receive my word, but I have written -- perhaps he will think sharply and haughtily -- to B -- ; but I felt quite assured of what I was doing in love.<a name=9:27></a> Pray for them, that all may be well before God.<a name=9:28></a> Dear brethren, and you, dear brother, give no allowance to the flesh in any wise, but give all liberty to the Spirit, which is our blessing and power, as indwelling amongst us, and you shall be blest; and if you would be able to repress and rebuke the workings of Satan by it in others, give it no law in yourselves, but yield yourselves to God as those that are alive, yield yourselves to His Spirit, and seek it diligently.<a name=9:29></a>

		Dear Miss Kingdom, -- I was waiting to hear from Miss -- , or some of the letters you spoke of before I wrote; for you must remember that you are enjoying the rest and quiet of fellowship, and I am labouring, in whatever weakness, I may almost say, night and day, with almost all around, either opposing, or expecting to be sustained and fed, and one's judgment exercised at every step.<a name=12:1></a> So that I assure you, with the danger of being dragged into the world one is working in (which is more than you suppose), or the loss of communion, which success with men is always apt to produce -- while I have found my God most gracious -- the consciousness and enjoyment of communion with those who are within the reclaimed country is not only pleasant, but profitable, as keeping before one's mind what one is labouring for.<a name=12:2></a> They say that those who go as reclaimers into the backwoods, constantly fall into the mere backwoodsmen's life, instead of civilising them.<a name=12:3></a> I am much in the backwoods, not indeed as a settler, but leaving the tilled country much to other hands less hardened to suffer, while I could work till all the country be cleared; yet weeds will grow in fallow ground where all has been cleared, and Plymouth is much in my thoughts and prayers (however they may count me careless of them in my absence), that it should flourish as the garden of the Lord.<a name=12:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Indeed, if you would know the truth, what I dread, because of the blessing that is there, is too much concentration of my interest and my prayers where I have found so much christian happiness and kindness too, lest the Lord should say to me of this also, "Lovest thou me more than these?<a name=12:5></a>" But indeed, besides that which might be selfish, I am anxious enough about Plymouth to have longed to hear oftener than I have; and my dear brethren and sisters there must remember that my occupation is travelling and preaching two or three times a day, or as here, standing out on the question whether the gospel is to be preached, in spite of all the clergy, or not; and now that the Lord has opened the minds of the people, lecturing nightly, and expected to answer all the questions and hold every ground that anybody might question.<a name=12:6></a> Nevertheless, the Lord is wonderfully at work here, but this, of course, does not make the labour less.<a name=12:7></a> I suspect the real difficulty is hardly come yet, for the Lord has allowed no felt difficulty yet, but set the tide one way as regards those around me.<a name=12:8></a> In the meanwhile, the meeting at Powerscourt, as it has wrought conscious desires, and inquiry and prayer too, in the minds of many of the evangelical people in this place, there has been a considerable plunge made into the minds of this country by it, and this has partly exercised me, as interested in this country.<a name=12:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Aungier Street, too, as you know, through the captiousness of one person, has caused trouble.<a name=12:10></a> But the Lord worketh still His own way.<a name=12:11></a> There is a little church here which has caused in an idle town great trouble and confusion of thought, where the preaching of the gospel was made a crime before; yet I communicate there, preach the gospel, and none to hinder me.<a name=12:12></a> We have set up weekly scripture reading meetings, two of them at the two most worldly houses in Limerick.<a name=12:13></a> Our only present difficulty is to keep people out.<a name=12:14></a> Pray that the Lord may turn this to His own real blessing in truth.<a name=12:15></a> The Lord is working strangely; one's only part is to follow closely in the path of His will, and not be led in anything from the point of blessing.<a name=12:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Pray for me, dear brethren.<a name=12:17></a> I feed a little day by day upon scripture, and we shall find something to talk about, I dare say, when I meet you all.<a name=12:18></a> Meanwhile, I do commend you earnestly to God, and beg your prayers, that that Spirit, by which alone there can be profit or blessing, may descend, and be abundantly upon me -- yea, upon all the church: it is the church's great necessity.<a name=12:19></a> I preached a good deal upon it here.<a name=12:20></a> Is there much prayer for it at Plymouth?<a name=12:21></a> I do trust there is; nothing would I press more.<a name=12:22></a> Is there much real prayer there now?<a name=12:23></a> May I not be sure there is, and that you abound in reading and good works; your labour is not in vain in the Lord.<a name=12:24></a> Do not let even the enjoyment of your social meeting, pleasant and profitable as it is, trench upon your actual service among those without, specially the poor; as it is harder and less grateful, so when done in the Spirit, the Lord especially meets and blesses them.<a name=12:25></a> Be much among the poor, the Lord always owns it, it was always His way, and it has its peculiar importance in more ways than men suppose.<a name=12:26></a> It is His order and place of the church, for results are not always from apparent causes.<a name=12:27></a> Blessed is the man that considereth the poor.<a name=12:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You may be sure that when my spirit flags I think of Plymouth, as I do also ever, with earnest prayer for the Lord's sake.<a name=12:29></a> I have been detained here longer than I thought, which will be accounted for by what I have mentioned.<a name=12:30></a> The Lord's hand was remarkable.<a name=12:31></a> The bishop was removed.<a name=12:32></a> The Independent minister, a real Christian, and labouring, but confined and hindering in some things, away; and -- , the minister who is setting up the chapel away; and I brought here in an unlooked for way, and those most adverse turned to be the houses open for the truth.<a name=12:33></a> Were I to tell you the detail of these circumstances, you would see yet more the Lord's hand.<a name=12:34></a> All I pray is, that the depth of His purpose may not be hindered by our weakness.<a name=12:35></a> I have yet Clare to visit, and perhaps a day's run into Mayo, but that will be nothing; and then, please God, I shall turn my ways towards Plymouth.<a name=12:36></a> It may be, I may go through London and Oxford, or perhaps take it in my way there, and see you for three or four hours and then return there.<a name=12:37></a> Such is my purpose; we must think of Bristol also, but that would be at and with Plymouth.<a name=12:38></a> I will write to W.<a name=12:39></a>, please God, speedily, but would yet rather he would write to me, so that I may hear of all (What of the Penitentiary?<a name=12:40></a>), though it is a comfort to me ever to write to Plymouth.<a name=12:41></a>

		MY DEAR BROTHER [G V Wigram], -- I was minded to write to you a good while, and thought I might have heard from you for I was working and travelling, so as to make my writing a matter of daily postponement.<a name=15:1></a> I should not have had today probably to do it, but that I missed the coach, which was to be my first regular stage in my journey towards Plymouth.<a name=15:2></a> I dare say -- I may be sure it was all right, for indeed I was utterly knocked up; and it gave me an opportunity of visiting some here, whom I must otherwise have passed by.<a name=15:3></a> The Lord opened so unexpectedly a door, and gave me so far way here, as it made it difficult for me to leave it.<a name=15:4></a> However, I thought it best to postpone further work here till a subsequent opportunity, and I gave up Mayo for the present so as to be able to go to Plymouth.<a name=15:5></a> I shall start, please God, to-morrow morning on my way, though my way will be a little circuitous.<a name=15:6></a> I expect your happiness and state will give me great rest at Plymouth, for I do not doubt I shall be well glad of it by the time I reach there.<a name=15:7></a> I was fain to lie down on the rug today and go asleep, from mere fatigue.<a name=15:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord has called several here, I think, to far more affectionate devotedness of heart than they were used to, and with this, blessing; we have had too, readings among the Roman Catholics, with very comfortable success, and some Protestants, who are working among the poor; but save this, generally the place was exceedingly dead.<a name=15:9></a> I trust many have been aroused since I have been here, and the Lord's coming looked for by many, and some brought to peace.<a name=15:10></a> We have also some very nice scripture reading meetings, to which any of the clergy who hold the truth, have fallen in, though quite mixed, and every one at liberty to speak.<a name=15:11></a> It is chiefly, of course, on what may be called first principles, but I trust thorough ones practically.<a name=15:12></a> It is a remarkable circumstance, that a dear young lady, who was instrumental in setting them afloat for me, and at several members of whose family they were held -- who had been only called about a year by the Lord, but was very decided ever since -- was suddenly called away the other day in the midst of it all.<a name=15:13></a> The people in Limerick felt it a good deal, and I trust it may be the instrument of good to many.<a name=15:14></a> The whole family, which was a principal one here, had been all thoroughly worldly a year ago, and herself and her sister at the head of all idleness.<a name=15:15></a> A little church has been formed, or rather, body, like the one at Plymouth, for communion, and I think, though in great weakness, much blessed.<a name=15:16></a> On the whole, there is much to be thankful for here, and I think the germ of much greater good.<a name=15:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I meant to have written to you at that Powerscourt meeting, which took a very marked and decided character, and where evil and good came into great conflict, the Lord holding the reins, but I suppose -- has told you all about it, and probably you have heard from Lady page I feel as if I had lived two years since I came to Ireland, in the development of the Lord's work, and seeing that there is nothing, nothing else to live for.<a name=15:18></a> The Lord always gave me different work to do from what I lay out for myself almost, and puts me into positions I little seek.<a name=15:19></a> This meeting has done so here.<a name=15:20></a> I am not surprised at that.<a name=15:21></a> So the Lord be with me, I care not where He lead me.<a name=15:22></a> The greater the difficulty, the greater the honour and blessing too.<a name=15:23></a> I thought to have looked for a few sheep here and there, ministering the love of Christ to them.<a name=15:24></a> Perhaps I was not counted worthy of this, for surely it is a pleasanter work than being a man of contentions, with all these useless [discussions]<a href="#15:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> of truth; may others have a free course to run after -- that is all.<a name=15:25></a>

		BELOVED BROTHER AND BRETHREN, -- I waited awhile to write with an object which has partly indeed been attained, but not attained with the same comfort I might have desired, yet still, with the comfort of seeing one's way rather.<a name=16:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord favoured me with a most quiet and easy passage for such a time of year.<a name=16:2></a> A poor soul died on board, and so unlooked for, that though I had intended to speak to him, hearing he was ill, he was gone before the opportunity came; it was a picture of sorrow and evil, but there is One who has remedied all.<a name=16:3></a> I do trust the church will feel my undiminished and anxious affection for them all, and as my mind draws nearer the Lord (for daily is our salvation nearer than when we believed), the more does it rest towards them in the brighter necessity of His love.<a name=16:4></a> This is the great secret, even His love towards them.<a name=16:5></a> I do trust they will walk all together in perfect love, even to the common cause of His love.<a name=16:6></a> I do feel that the Lord has been singularly gracious to you all there, in preserving you, and not allowing the enemy to set aside His love.<a name=16:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is but one thing rests at all upon my mind now, and that has been brought to a mere question of individual profit, and need not, and does not, I trust, hinder the full unhindered flow of the Spirit of God and of love; in that I will employ your service, and I charge any upon whom there might rest any want of it for a moment, that they do not grieve the Spirit by the want of perfect charity toward all.<a name=16:8></a> Let me hear what you do about the services please, and how you all get on.<a name=16:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here the Lord brought me most opportunely, and in a way of His own order, into intercourse with all those who were the links of my service here; one young clergyman from the north, who has formed a society precisely on the principle we recognise, only as a clergyman not having the Lord's supper, came to know how he would effect a correspondence between all the other like ones, in order to their mutual recognition as brethren for fellowship when they went into any such places and to get them visited for profit.<a name=16:10></a> I hear the north is dotted with little bodies, meeting as you do, though I do not know the places.<a name=16:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Dear H.<a name=16:12></a> stood up manfully in a large meeting of clergy, where the practical question was, should they stop when the bishop inhibited them from preaching, and declared his obedience to Christ, and strengthened many hands in it.<a name=16:13></a> The old evangelists, of course, thought they ought to stop.<a name=16:14></a> The brethren, two of them, had [been] inhibited the preaching in part of the northern mission.<a name=16:15></a> Everything is opening rapidly in this country, and the hierarchy, as an evil agency, will go.<a name=16:16></a> I am no enemy to episcopacy abstractedly, if it be real and done from the Lord; and I doubt that it will stand here in any other way.<a name=16:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I pray, earnestly, truly pray is, that we may walk so near the Lord, that we may have all His mind, and then we shall indeed be sure of His peace, and keep up with the real exigencies, the happy exigencies of His service.<a name=16:18></a> I feel clear in judgment, but what I seek is that nearness to God and to Christ, which may make me act in the Spirit, and rectitude of heart, will, and character into which it forms, and in which that judgment is made effectual and representative of God.<a name=16:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would I had you with me, but you are of more importance in England, and at Plymouth; there you should stay.<a name=16:20></a> I feel daily more the importance of the Christians at page, and I do trust that you will keep infinitely far from sectarianism.<a name=16:21></a> The great body of the Christians who are accustomed to religion, are scarce capable of understanding anything else, as the mind ever tends there.<a name=16:22></a> If they become so in their position before God, they would be utterly useless, and I am persuaded, immediately broken to pieces.<a name=16:23></a> You are nothing, nobody, but Christians, and the moment you cease to be an available mount for communion for any consistent Christian, you will go to pieces or help the evil.<a name=16:24></a> Pray much to God that you may be kept from concessions, acts, in which Satan may get an advantage over you in it.<a name=16:25></a> The church at Limerick have so multiplied, that they must seek some place of meeting, and one has offered, and the hour they talk of changing to twelve, the hour for other places -- previously it has been eight.<a name=16:26></a> This is a cause of anxiety to me, whilst I wait on the Lord's will, for I feel the importance of the moral character of the step, for unless called for, it would have the same tendency.<a name=16:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A dear brother, and one previously of most faithful conversation, has run into Manichaeism, and writes thus: "I have been fasting for nine days, save one cup of tea, and then walked ten miles into London, where I was desired to eat.<a name=16:28></a> My mouth and throat were dry and exhausted the whole time, but I was exceedingly jealous of taking anything to eat there, lest I should mar the work of destruction which was going on in my blood -- the work of cleansing my blood from the old reprobate life inherited from Adam, and substituting the Lord's.<a name=16:29></a> (See Leviticus 17.<a name=16:30></a> 11; Joel 3.<a name=16:31></a> 2.<a name=16:32></a>) This is what our Lord means when He says, the vessel must be made new before it is fit to receive the new wine of the kingdom.<a name=16:33></a>" And I found a notion from the person who gave me this letter, in a paper I hindered, I hope, his publishing, "That the blood of Christ, His condemned life, was spilt upon the ground like water, and that His new resurrection life was what He carried within the veil"; and he I think a true-hearted saint, and his paper full, though this error, of most interesting matter.<a name=16:34></a> What a mercy it is to be kept from the vast and endless wanderings of thought with which Satan now seeks to bewilder saints, or else shut them up in systematic ignorance!<a name=16:35></a> May you, knowing what it is to be complete in Him, and in all the rich depths in Him, be kept from going out in the profitless mazes of Satan.<a name=16:36></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do feel that the ignorance and narrowness of the Church of England will be what will be judged for all this, and the judgment is at hand, lingereth not.<a name=16:37></a> The Lord have mercy on many in it -- dear saints.<a name=16:38></a> I do not know so ignorant, and ill-formed a body as it is.<a name=16:39></a>

		VERY DEAR BROTHER [J L Harris], -- You might think I was a very unfaithful fulfiller of my purpose of writing, but indeed it was much very anxious trouble that came upon me in service, besides my ordinary labour, that precluded me a good deal from carrying my intention into effect, in which I would I had you with me, though I do not know whether any but my hard heart would have set itself against it, as I felt was the only way.<a name=19:1></a> Heresy was infecting many places round, by a very subtle, clever person, who, though he had driven many away by his bitterness, had acquired great influence over the minds of those whom he had not -- of the worst character when it had avowed itself without fear, but assuming so subtle a form when attacked, that the poor people could scarce tell what it was about, while it went on in secret in his hands, infecting their minds, though not spoken of to them that had understanding.<a name=19:2></a> This was a great trial, for it looked often to others as if I was trying to prove the man wrong, when he was not holding anything particular, and his plausibility was extreme.<a name=19:3></a> Save as looking to the Lord the Spirit to secure His own, and walking therein in bounden faithfulness to Christ, I do not know what I should have done, but the Lord kept me through it.<a name=19:4></a> The extreme disingenuousness which was apparent to those who had interviews with the person and understood the matter, strengthened one's hand in the consciousness that it could not be of the Lord in its liability to bewilder the poor people.<a name=19:5></a> However, it was a great trial, but the Lord has turned it to good as I believe, though some are resting a little, as it were, under the effects of it, as he yet seeks to maintain a party; but it will do good to the others, I can see, and I thank God for all.<a name=19:6></a> It was a great mercy it was discovered: it was entirely through the Lord's hand, for he never openly preached it, though he disseminated it everywhere he could.<a name=19:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is remarkable how the reasoning of man fails and comes to nothing in the pursuit of divine truth, but I have felt this a great trial to my spirit, that instead of drawing lovingly from the fresh springs that are in Christ, in whom all fulness dwells, one was discussing whether we were so or so.<a name=19:8></a> Now, except as recipients through the grace that is in Christ, we are utterly incompetent to deal with man, or to have anything to say to God, and the tendency of such service, though kept by grace, is to make God the subject -- which is impossible -- instead of us.<a name=19:9></a> This is the real difference between philosophy and religion, and which makes the one <i>all</i> false and the other all true.<a name=19:10></a> God cannot be God in discussion.<a name=19:11></a> He has lost His essentiality in our minds.<a name=19:12></a> He has ceased to be God to us.<a name=19:13></a> Hence there is no real philosophy but faith -- the realisation of what God is.<a name=19:14></a> I recollect being struck with this long ago, when I was a poor dark creature, reading the Offices, I think, at the expression, <i>Subjecta veritas quasi materia</i>.<a name=19:15></a> It makes the mind of God, which it is not, and God subject to its judgment, which is the worst lie about Him that can be told: in fact there is then no God: it is worse than Adam's, "Ye shall be as gods.<a name=19:16></a>" It is destruction to the mind.<a name=19:17></a> Faith understands a great many things about God, but it sees God in them, and it has truth.<a name=19:18></a> Philosophy may talk, even with the same names, but there is no God in it, and hence, what it has is false.<a name=19:19></a> If I judge that God ought to love everybody by mere human feeling, I am not vindicating love, but denying supremacy, and its operation in detail, as the potter over the clay, to do all things after the counsel of His own will.<a name=19:20></a> The natural man may see no difference, but there is all moral difference if I am or am not associated with God, and this is the grand aim of Satan in all heresy, to take the mind off its state of recipiency into a state of judging of mere propositions; its strength is gone, and being incompetent to speak but from grace so as to confound error, the opportunity of falsehood, from which no grace can be drawn, is introduced; and while the sheep of Christ are starved, those who are not come in in apparent belief -- [cannot]<a href="#19:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> be hindered -- the devil's children joining in a falsehood.<a name=19:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The state of recipient grace from the truth of God is the only guard against it, because the mind is conscious then of the communion that it has with God in the thing which it defends.<a name=19:22></a> The scripture is the guard against any delusion in this, which if [used] under the teaching of God's Spirit will answer everything; and it is alone to be relied on.<a name=19:23></a> It is God's representation of those things in which is the source of grace -- Christ the key to all.<a name=19:24></a> I have felt great occasion to guard against this latterly .<a name=19:25></a>.<a name=19:26></a>.<a name=19:27></a> though it has strengthened me in all established truths, and the rather enabled me to see what they meant, when one would have thought of nothing wrong.<a name=19:28></a> This person would tell all the truths in scripture, passing by the one point, in which error, fatal error, ran: and hence the difficulty unless the power of God's Spirit was so upon the souls of all, as to make them practically feel the value and power of this; otherwise it seemed refuting one who held all the fundamentals of truth for the sake of some inaccuracy.<a name=19:29></a> I feel that the presence of God's Spirit can alone so bring out the bright value and lustre of the truth, as to detect heresy, and then that grace is not in the matter, and discover the flesh in it.<a name=19:30></a> There is the subtlety, and where Satan gets in.<a name=19:31></a> You never can wield the flesh against the flesh to any good, and the mere reasonings of our mind are nothing, and no stronger, but the same as the heresy.<a name=19:32></a> But the Spirit of God detects that there is no grace in it, and thus the saint is preserved.<a name=19:33></a>

		Dear brother, I have just re-read your note on the Kingdom of Heaven, and I assure you it refreshed me.<a name=19:34></a> It drew me back to the pleasant scenes in which I, with you and other brethren, I mean, have fed together on the refreshing pastures of God's life-giving and heart-satisfying word.<a name=19:35></a> And, indeed, while I rejoice before God at the thought of your all walking in love, if you would strengthen me in many trials, and I know you would a poor weak brother, it is just by the love in which, as I trust, you are all walking together.<a name=19:36></a> I know, as you know, the trials and comparative difficulties that are amongst you: I feel in your weaknesses as bearing part of them, yet I do see a comfort of love and a blessing from it, which while I taste the Lord's goodness in many places, I do not find elsewhere, though I see much christian kindness.<a name=19:37></a> And it is not merely the happiness that is in it, but I see plainly that it is in this that the refreshings of God's grace and truth come, and are to be found.<a name=19:38></a> The Spirit can plant and water there.<a name=19:39></a> And while I know all our weakness, and mourn over it before God, as a part of the desolate, the poor -- as it were, as to her own state deserted -- church (yet not of God for blessing and inheritance), yet I find the joy of the Spirit and the comfort of the Spirit's teaching among you as my joy; and so I trust I may find you.<a name=19:40></a> It makes me feel what may be elsewhere -- what fruit the principles bear.<a name=19:41></a> Dear Lady page frightened me by the commendation she gave you, but I know you all better than she did.<a name=19:42></a> But I quite fell in with your exposition, and, as I said, feel refreshed by it.<a name=19:43></a>

		My view of Matthew 13 (of which we may speak more, please God, when we meet -- I do not know exactly when that will be -- though it is in my hope), was of the results [or] of the principles on which those results were founded; and I feel it a very interesting connecting link of the two systems -- "things new and old.<a name=19:44></a>" I say this, because Christ, who will sit on His own throne, sits now on His Father's throne, and therefore does not exercise that discriminating power in the world which He will when He assumes it, distributing in power, what we ought to be witnesses of, and of which the Spirit is witness in the church, righteousness -- but righteousness to suffering, for the truth of the moral glory is to give it the glory.<a name=19:45></a> "O righteous Father" -- and He went into the Father's glory.<a name=19:46></a> I speak of Him exalted as a Man, because He had borne witness of it faithfully on earth -- we into His, because we (oh, how weakly) have suffered first on earth, and get into the Father's house and kingdom because we have known it and done it as sons, for we could not be His disciples unless we glorified the Father; but our share in righteousness is to have the glory, "seeing it is a righteous thing with God.<a name=19:47></a>" What we are witnesses of we shall be partakers of, so that we may be unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as we know that our labour is not in vain in the Lord.<a name=19:48></a>

		I am pressed here beyond my strength; a few like-minded now I find, of those who ought to follow out the Lord fully, though owning it in their own spirit.<a name=19:68></a> The Lord is very gracious, and is, in spite of our foolishness, working widely in the country.<a name=19:69></a> The clergy are in a position, I think, of great, very great guilt; but there is sufficient grace among them individually -- many of them -- to make many hold by them, though those that have it see plainly, and can testify of the breaking up of all around them.<a name=19:70></a> They are, I think, very guilty.<a name=19:71></a> But the Lord is working in another way.<a name=19:72></a> There is not enough energy of the Spirit outside them to absorb everything to itself, though there is a very extensive breaking loose; but there is a craving for scripture knowledge, and desire for communion, which they cannot meet in their present state; and by scripture-reading meetings, and by the clergy themselves in many instances making churches, not with communion, but admitting all Christians, and many little bodies springing up, things are assuming a new shape, though unformed, and there will be an entirely new state of things in a year or two.<a name=19:73></a> This country will, I doubt not, be practically separated from England, probably entirely.<a name=19:74></a> The attempt is making to reorganise the church, and with considerable present influence amongst the clergy who have risen, one may say, against the present state of things.<a name=19:75></a> The subordinate, or, as I should say, the insubordinate, clergy, are trying to get the matter into their own hands.<a name=19:76></a> I do not see righteousness in this.<a name=19:77></a> I am sure it will restrict them.<a name=19:78></a> They exclude laymen from the mission now, and, of course, I do not go on there.<a name=19:79></a> The principle of communion in which you meet in Plymouth seems to rejoice the hearts of those engaged in it wherever it has been practised, so that the Lord is manifestly working.<a name=19:80></a> He will surely draw substantially His saints together before the end come, though there may be some left in, like Lot.<a name=19:81></a> In the meantime, one has only to work on.<a name=19:82></a> Adieu, dear brother.<a name=19:83></a> My love, very deep and affectionate love, to all the brethren and sisters.<a name=19:84></a> Grace, mercy and peace be with you all.<a name=19:85></a> I assure you I have much comfort in you all in the midst of many trials.<a name=19:86></a> I hope, please God, to see you ere long.<a name=19:87></a> I wish I had some of you over here at Limerick, for instance, for a while, where there is much and nice work.<a name=19:88></a>

		MY VERY DEAR BROTHER [Mr H Barleage?<a name=24:1></a> (H Borlase)], -- I received your letter with great comfort, both as witness of your kind remembrance, and as letting me know of my dear brethren and sisters at Plymouth; though now so much scattered, that I miss so many well-known names, I trust only for a while.<a name=24:2></a> How much I love them there they, I trust, in a measure, and my own heart, surely know!<a name=24:3></a> The Lord has shewn me many pleasant services; still, the opening out to so much brotherly kindness, and love, and fellowship was, I believe, first at page; and my heart continually turns there with the fondest recollection of it, though a better place is still before us.<a name=24:4></a> I do feel every day the infinite deficiency of one's labour, and do long for the abounding of this labour in myself, and to see the Lord's vineyard continuously dressed and cultivated, so that no need should appear, and labourers in it, whose hearts were in its ministrations.<a name=24:5></a> Oh, what wise hearts, what patient hearts, what large hearts, in the scope of all the necessities, and the infinite grace that suits them, ought those hearts to be!<a name=24:6></a> What a heart of prayer that ministers to, feeds, and cultivates the Lord's vineyard, and the hearts of the children of His saints, the plants of the Lord's planting; watching every noxious weed, seeing roots of bitterness before they spring up and claim their right by prescription to the soil!<a name=24:7></a> Indeed, the Lord has been very gracious to us at page, and I trust will continue to minister there amongst us; for surely He, however gently and lovingly in manner -- and how much is it so!<a name=24:8></a> -- is the great purger of the vine or its branches.<a name=24:9></a> I should regret indeed, much, the scattering of the brethren at page However, the Lord orders all things (and much better than we do), so that I feel disposed exceedingly to bow, sometimes I fear too listlessly -- which is not right -- to what arises.<a name=24:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It would appear that the thought has arisen in -- 's mind of settling at Limerick, but I have heard nothing from him; he is to be with us, as arranged, today.<a name=24:11></a> There might be good there: I dread transplanting a good deal; it is not raising up people in the place; however, you are an argument against that, though only sub modo; he would be hailed there I am sure.<a name=24:12></a> So much have I felt the necessity of letting the Spirit of God work in each place, I have sometimes hesitated in having been the instrument, much as it might have been my delight and my comfort, of bringing any of my dear brethren over here.<a name=24:13></a> Bellett has just returned from visiting the churches or little bodies, South-west, and came back very happy from them, refreshed by their zeal and grace, which has in no small way comforted me, as you may suppose; he reports much grace, not much gift.<a name=24:14></a> I like this; it is a good order, yet I believe that many of them there would be found better informed in most important points of Christianity than most of their neighbours; but their minds have been recently expanded, and want deepening and strengthening in what they have opened to.<a name=24:15></a> I have long been quite aware of what he speaks of, nor have I indeed regretted it particularly; it taught them wonderfully to lean upon the Lord, and look for grace, and for communion, and His teaching, more than mere leaning on ministry, yet He never left them actually destitute, even of this; and indeed, almost all the active exertion in their parts is in their hands.<a name=24:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to work, I do trust the Lord is surely working there: as to the "Witness," I think we ought to have something more of direct testimony as to the Lord's coming, and its bearing also on the state of the church: ordinarily, it would not be well to have it so clear, as it frightens people.<a name=24:17></a> We must pursue it steadily; it works like leaven, and its fruit is by no means seen yet; I do not mean leaven as ill, but the thoughts are new, and people's minds work on them, and all the old habits are against their feelings -- all the gain of situation, and every worldly motive; we must not be surprised at its effect being slow on the mass, the ordinary instruments of acting upon others having been trained in most opposite habits.<a name=24:18></a> There is a great effort making in this country to keep the reformation within the church, and not let it go farther than they like; for they are very anxious, as always, to keep God within their own bounds: it will not do in the end, nor, if we are faithful, on the way.<a name=24:19></a> There is one advantage in sometimes scattering (not, however, counterbalancing the habit of communion bringing the Lord's presence), and that is the acquisition of the habit of work, a thing much individually blessed ever; but I do feel so utterly our need of leaning on the Lord for these things for the management of the church.<a name=24:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Dear brother, I speak not as though you did not, but for love's sake: seek singleness of eye to our blessed Master's glory above all things, and that that glory which shall be alone and above all in the Father's love in that day, may shine so ever in our hearts even now; we must be the Lord's ministers if we were to beg our daily bread; at least, I feel so, but I equally feel how constantly we must wholly depend upon God's Spirit, to guide and lead one in the path He has ordered for blessing, and the glory of truth in Christ Jesus, that one may meet Him with joy.<a name=24:21></a> Grace be with you, my dear brother .<a name=24:22></a>.<a name=24:23></a>.<a name=24:24></a> .<a name=24:25></a> I suppose I may go to the north shortly.<a name=24:26></a> May the Lord be with me, and make me His wise servant.<a name=24:27></a> My kindest love to all my dear brethren and sisters (I suppose Wigram has left you), and also to the poor people in K.<a name=24:28></a> Street, and how I rejoice to hear they are going on comfortably; may the Lord keep and bless them abundantly.<a name=24:29></a> I rejoice that G.<a name=24:30></a> has been faithful; he may be assured the Lord will bless him, not but we all ought to do it, as a matter of course.<a name=24:31></a> The Lord bless you and keep you, dear brother, and make you to abound more and more in the only true riches.<a name=24:32></a>

		Dear Mrs.<a name=27:1></a> Ord, -- With regard to the question of Mr.<a name=27:2></a> -- 's letter on 1 Corinthians 15: 28, I have not myself any difficulty.<a name=27:3></a> Any one acquainted with scripture must see that there is a kingdom given to Christ as Man, distinct from His personal glory as God.<a name=27:4></a> "And I saw one like unto the Son of man, and they brought him near before him, and there was given him a kingdom.<a name=27:5></a>" This kingdom given Him as Son of man is clearly distinct from Godhead.<a name=27:6></a> But the place from which the passage quotes is Psalm 8.<a name=27:7></a> "What is man that thou art mindful of him," etc.<a name=27:8></a> "Thou hast put all things under his feet.<a name=27:9></a>" This we see not yet, says the apostle.<a name=27:10></a> (Hebrews 2.<a name=27:11></a>) The church is united to Him in it, says Paul.<a name=27:12></a> (Ephesians 1, last verses.<a name=27:13></a>) Now this clearly given to man, put under Him as Man, and not yet put under Him, is a matter of dispensation, which does not affect any question of Godhead.<a name=27:14></a> This He gives up, and it does not more affect the question of His being God than of His being Man before He got it.<a name=27:15></a> He takes it, moreover, as acquired by obedience, though due to Him as Son.<a name=27:16></a> (See Colossians 1: 16.<a name=27:17></a> Compare Philippians 2.<a name=27:18></a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the dominion referred to in 1 Corinthians 15 is the dominion of Psalm 8, of the risen Man, which He has so taken that the church may have it with Him, as well as for His own and God's glory.<a name=27:19></a> "Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father," that is, the kingdom which He has received as Man, of which the whole chapter treats -- the resurrection of the Man -- "that God [not the Father, for that is here left out; but God in contrast with man in the mediatorial kingdom; for "there is one mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus"] may be all in all," not Christ as Mediator.<a name=27:20></a> Now Christ is all in all; but mediatorial rule shall be given up when its end is accomplished, "when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and all power, for he must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet: the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death:" then this will be given up, and the Son subject.<a name=27:21></a> This may create the difficulty, but in fact does not touch the great question of this giving up the kingdom, and subjection of the Son, for He had not taken the kingdom, and yet He was subject when He was upon earth.<a name=27:22></a> The exercise of the supreme jurisdiction and rule on the part of God as Man, adds nothing to His Godhead; His giving it up takes nothing from it.<a name=27:23></a> He was subject upon earth; there it was, I believe, I get, not the fact but, the main proof that He was God, by what He manifested as Man; His natural place of perfection was subjection, and so He was upon earth perfect.<a name=27:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The royal exaltation as Man was an extraordinary thing, due perhaps, but given on account of His humiliation, that all, even the wicked (who would not, when present in grace), should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father; but the Lord in His death, I believe, had His ear bored, and became a servant for ever, refusing to go out free because He loved His Master, His wife, His children.<a name=27:25></a> Now, whatever special exaltation may be the fruit of His travail as Man, His abiding glory is as Head of the new race, Man perfectly blessed in the place in which man ought to be, in the presence of the God of blessing.<a name=27:26></a> He could not in that perfect state go out of His place as Man, subjection, for all is perfect there.<a name=27:27></a> This alters nothing of His place as God, any more than it did when He was on earth, subject to all, but "the Son of man, oJ w]n in heaven," the Jehovah of His ancient people.<a name=27:28></a> To this state I should apply Revelation 21: 1-8; the Lamb is not mentioned there; what follows is descriptive, not continuous history.<a name=27:29></a> The subjection of the Son thus is to me a glorious filling up of the great scheme of perfection, and the endless fruit of that love in which, being "all of one," He is not ashamed, though source of all the blessings -- "He is not ashamed to call them brethren.<a name=27:30></a>" "Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things that he suffered.<a name=27:31></a>" This, I trust, may answer your inquiry; if you have with any one any further difficulty, I shall be glad, as far as the Lord enables me, who alone can teach and convince us of the blessed truths of the glory of our Redeemer's Person, to communicate to you all that has been given me for good.<a name=27:32></a> Spiritual communion with the Lord makes these truths, not only proveable, but dear to us, for He who is our portion is unfolded to us in them, in all His unsearchable fulness.<a name=27:33></a> They acquire a power and force as a part of our intercourse with God, and as known in Him, which mere reasoning cannot give them, while they have to be simply received on the authority of the word.<a name=27:34></a> You will always find submission to the word in question in these cases, that is, of our mind to God, and this is the secret of the question.<a name=27:35></a>

		The great truth of the divinity of Jesus, that He is God, is written all through scripture with a sunbeam, but written to faith.<a name=27:36></a> I cannot hesitate in seeing the Son, the Jehovah of the Old Testament, the First and the Last, Alpha and Omega, and thus it shines all through.<a name=27:37></a> But He fills all things, and His manhood, true, proper manhood, as true, proper Godhead, is as precious to me, and makes me know God, and so indeed only as the other, He is "the true God and eternal life.<a name=27:38></a>" That there is a God, a heathen might, at least ought to, know: that He was here revealed to me in Jesus is my glory and joy, and eternal life as a Christian: that He who alone could do it and be uncontaminated, laid His cleansing and unsoiled hand on me as a leper, saying, "I will, be thou clean," is my salvation and my thankfulness for ever.<a name=27:39></a> May He, by the Holy Spirit, who gives us fellowship in union with Him and the Father, fill you with the holiness and joy in hope and comprehension which flow from Him, and our wondrous union with Him, setting us in Him above all principalities and powers; and make our union with Him, who fills all things, precious to your soul, and to abound in all your ways to His glory in simplicity of service, to whom alone service is due.<a name=27:40></a> Commending you to Him, who alone can keep, and give force and direct.<a name=27:41></a>

		G V Wigram -- With regard to speaking, I am quite clear those who speak error ought to be stopped, and those, I think, who speak merely from the suggestion of the flesh, ought to be first warned of it.<a name=29:1></a> Any one may do it in love, but those who guide may, if it be needed, take it up, and that for their own sakes who have done it; and if there were from this, habitual unprofitable speaking, I think it ought to be stopped.<a name=29:2></a> Those who are active in this, must carry the sense of the brethren, which if rightly ordered under the Spirit is a real test of unprofitableness, with them; for that is the ground of the act.<a name=29:3></a> I never could understand why the church of God is to be the only place where flesh is to have its way unrestrained.<a name=29:4></a> It is folly to suppose this.<a name=29:5></a> I desire the fullest liberty for the Spirit, but not the least for the flesh.<a name=29:6></a> The church, for God's glory, is as bound to stop it there (and more, for it is the place of holy order) as elsewhere, and the means are just the same, the grounds just the same, and it is written, "Let the others judge.<a name=29:7></a>" Such, I think, is the very simple principle and rule of practice.<a name=29:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On the other hand.<a name=29:9></a> I am very jealous of meddling, merely because there is not the same refinement, or people being puffed up for one against another; that is just the flesh in another shape.<a name=29:10></a> The poor often get profit, where a refined ear would be offended.<a name=29:11></a> It is a holy loving wisdom which must order this.<a name=29:12></a> In [cases] of error, the act should be prompt, in cases of profit, patient.<a name=29:13></a> But I must say I have not the least idea of subjecting myself to the self-will of another's notion, that he is to speak when he cannot profit the church.<a name=29:14></a> I should take the liberty of going away in such an extreme case, and try the question summarily if driven to it.<a name=29:15></a> I never knew the Lord desert me, or rather the act of obedience to His own will.<a name=29:16></a> In such a case, I have no right to wrong the whole church of God, making them unhappy, and hindering the gathering of the saints, to humour the flesh of any.<a name=29:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But then, this must be clearly, and if needs be, patiently ascertained, acting in all quietness, though in all firmness; for the other extreme of stopping people unnecessarily, or merely because they do not please the ear as well, hinders the gathering to Christ equally on the other side.<a name=29:18></a>

		If, for example, it will be always my delight to help the brethren, whether in England or abroad, as our brethren do according to their power; but if I undertook to do such and such a thing, all that I have might fail me through the providence of God, or a more pressing need might present itself, and I, already bound, should fail, either as to the will of God or my engagements; and, further, I have a very strong objection -- I am, in fact, entirely opposed -- to sending any one into the Lord's field with a salary of so much per annum.<a name=31:34></a> I can only say that it will be my joy, by the grace of God, to relieve the needs of my brethren according to my power, but to engage any one to work is, it seems to me, to take the place of faith, at least, if there were not some special direction.<a name=31:35></a> I wish to make you understand all the interest I should take in helping you if God call you to the work, on one side, and on the other to prevent you from counting on me or any man whatever.<a name=31:36></a>

		[Mr Maylon] [From the French.<a name=33:1></a>] VERY DEAR BROTHER, -- I was rejoiced to receive your letter, and to see that you are in fact working in the Lord's field, and for the Lord.<a name=33:2></a> Specially that you are able to trust yourself to the Lord to sustain you in your path, and to maintain you as to the things of this world.<a name=33:3></a> You have already, dear brother, made proof of His faithfulness, as you told me.<a name=33:4></a> Be very sure that He will never fail in it.<a name=33:5></a> Oh, for more faith, that we might be able to trust ourselves to His incomparable faithfulness, to His love, which will make us pass without doubt, through testings for our good, but which at least never wearies.<a name=33:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Dear brother, in the midst of much unfaithfulness, I have always found Him faithful -- I can bear witness to it -- and more than faithful, always full of mercy and goodness.<a name=33:7></a> It is a happy thing to be able to be witness to one's God, though in humbling oneself for all one's own wretchedness.<a name=33:8></a> When the goodness and will of our God have forced us out into His harvest, we have always need to be well on our guard against the wiles of the enemy, especially when we leave, even ever so little, the ordinary path of Christians.<a name=33:9></a> One is so accustomed to trust oneself to men, the habit of it is so rooted in the ways of Christians, and in their manner of working as to the gospel, that Satan is extremely jealous of those who separate themselves from it, and who trust themselves to our God, and he lays for them all possible snares, and even Christians look constantly to see them fall; so much so, that if we do not keep our spirit carefully, we are always in danger.<a name=33:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are many Christians who withdraw from us from the first, saying that it is pride that prompts us to walk alone, when in fact they desert us in spite of ourselves; and this increases the danger, because the isolation in which we sometimes are, exposes us to the arrows of the enemy, either by the ordinary trials of life, or by the temptation of thinking too much of ourselves, and of leaning to either pride on the one side, or to depression on the other.<a name=33:11></a> Do I desire, dear brother, to discourage you in saying these things?<a name=33:12></a> far from it, but only to remind you that it is a life of faith, and that we cannot pass through this world of sin, when we are put ever so little forward, without constant communion of our souls with God.<a name=33:13></a> As you advance in your path of service, as I hope that you will advance, you will find that if you do not walk in the ordinary paths, a very great number of Christians will be opposed to you, an opposition much more painful than that of the world, which one ought to expect.<a name=33:14></a> And this because this question is agitated greatly at this moment, whether one ought to walk by faith or not.<a name=33:15></a> May God keep you in humility, and give you a firm and quiet faith which, recognising the duty put upon you of serving Him, has nothing to do but to obey Him, and to do His will.<a name=33:16></a> As to your temporal circumstances, dear brother, it will always be to me a great pleasure to help you.<a name=33:17></a> I am not very rich, but what I have, I hope, through the grace of our God, will be always devoted to His work .<a name=33:18></a>.<a name=33:19></a>.<a name=33:20></a> .<a name=33:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is still one thing, dear brother, that has come upon my spirit.<a name=33:22></a> I suppose that you have continued relations with the established church; perhaps I am mistaken, but I discern the possibility that these relations may be enfeebled if you follow the call to evangelisation which you think you have received from God.<a name=33:23></a> If this come to pass, I hope with all my heart that you will not throw yourself, on the other hand, into narrowness; it is this which has been one of the sores of Swiss Christians.<a name=33:24></a> I have nothing to hide from you in my christian ways (habitudes).<a name=33:25></a> It is my joy and my privilege to find myself in the midst of brethren who know one another in Christ, and to rejoice in the blessedness of brotherly communion in all the weakness in which it may be found at present; but I could not recognise an assembly that does not receive all the children of God, because I know that Christ receives them.<a name=33:26></a> I see the church in ruins: I follow my conscience according to the light that I have received from the word, but I desire to bear with the weakness or lack of light that I may find in other Christians, and do all that I can to unite those who love the Lord.<a name=33:27></a> The liberty of your ministry, if God bless it, may be a means to this desirable result; and I, according to the light that I have received, find it impossible to remain in nationalism, but I would rather remain alone and isolated, a position, I admit, not at all desirable, than to restrict the limits of the church of Christ to some brethren, even though they may be more correct in their thoughts than others, and to enfeeble the action of the Spirit of God in uniting the Lord's sheep, scattered by our wretchedness and by our sins.<a name=33:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have ventured to say these things to you, dear brother, in all frankness, because in all my weakness I have at least the good of the beloved church of my Saviour at heart, and further, because I love, and I ought to love in a special manner, the dear Swiss brethren, in the midst of whom I have received so many blessings, and so much love in Christ.<a name=33:29></a> I hope that God will keep you from every bond save the bonds of Christ, and that He will rivet these bonds of security and joy more and more.<a name=33:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If you are able not entirely to give up your calling, so much the better; the workman is worthy of his hire, but it is my experience that in the existing circumstances of the church, the more one is independent of men the better one is circumstanced.<a name=33:31></a> If you were able to apply yourself to it in leisure moments, or to work alone, and could sell what you made, even if you were not in an establishment, I do not know if the thing is possible, but for you even I am persuaded that it would be very desirable.<a name=33:32></a> I write in haste, dear brother, but I did not wish to delay my letter any longer.<a name=33:33></a> Be assured of the cordial and sincere love of

		[Mr E Maylon] [From the French.<a name=38:1></a>] DEAR BROTHER, -- I was very glad and thankful to receive your letter, and I bless God for having led you as He has done in His goodness, and am quite relieved to find that our brethren of La verse are edifying themselves together.<a name=38:2></a> It is a favour from God.<a name=38:3></a> When we are doing the will of God, God will help those that are cast down and He takes care of them, and the result is that they are greatly strengthened, because they make experience of the faithfulness of God.<a name=38:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Remember, dear brother, that it is dangerous to be raised all at once into a pulpit.<a name=38:5></a> It is not that I do not believe it to be the will of God, but you know that when St.<a name=38:6></a> Paul had been caught up, even into heaven, from the work of God, that would have been a snare to him, because of his flesh, but God is faithful to keep us.<a name=38:7></a> Man's acceptation is not God's approbation, although God can give it us to favour the propagation of the truth; but if we stop at the result, we are at a distance from the source, and that becomes a snare to wither up our soul, instead of a means to lead us to those upon whom we should pour out His riches.<a name=38:8></a> I believe that God has in His mercy allowed you to be tested, that you may know how little and feeble you are, before introducing you to the work.<a name=38:9></a> As for -- , although I hope it will never lose its attractions in your eyes, if God give you for a time work to do elsewhere, and that His will is clear to you, you ought to entrust these dear souls to Him who alone can -- whether you are absent or present -- feed and nourish them.<a name=38:10></a> No one will go further, I hope, than their faith will lead them.<a name=38:11></a> If they make progress in your absence, it will be a lesson, often very necessary, that God can act without us, but up to the present no one has visited them .<a name=38:12></a>.<a name=38:13></a>.<a name=38:14></a> .<a name=38:15></a> As to your debts, it is clear you ought to pay them, and a minister of the gospel ought not to suffer the reproach that he is going to work, or rather, according to them, to lead an idle life, instead of paying his debts.<a name=38:16></a> I shall be very glad to help you in carrying out this duty, but until I return to England I should hardly be able to do so.<a name=38:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I must stop.<a name=38:18></a> May God keep you in simplicity of heart, and always in the sense of your vileness before Him.<a name=38:19></a> All our joy is destroyed the moment we lose sight of what we are before Him; and our natural strength, for there is that, becomes to us the means of leading us to some fall like St.<a name=38:20></a> Peter.<a name=38:21></a> He truly loved the Lord, but he had confidence in that love for Jesus, and in his integrity which, nevertheless, was sincere.<a name=38:22></a> He could say, "Thou knowest all things, thou knowest that I love thee;" and he fell terribly, led by that very love, from the moment that he trusted it in the time of temptation.<a name=38:23></a> I do not suppose such things of you, dear brother, but I tell you these things out of love to you, in confidence that they will not happen.<a name=38:24></a> I trust in God for that, assured of His faithfulness.<a name=38:25></a> Only be watchful, and pray.<a name=38:26></a> Beware of the traditions of men, and of the spirit of the clergy; all that dries up the soul, dishonours the Lord, and nourishes the flesh, by the sense of human respectability, "the pride of life.<a name=38:27></a>" But at the same time, honour fully all the gifts God has given to whoever it may be.<a name=38:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What you tell me of the B.<a name=38:29></a>'s interests me greatly; only, dear brother, in acknowledging the truth of these hopes in general, for probably there are incorrect thoughts as to details, do not depart from the foundation with them.<a name=38:30></a> God has been merciful in giving you access to this people; may it be to bring in with all regard to their condition, and with all prudence, the whole truth.<a name=38:31></a> Perhaps you will find that fundamental truth will stumble some among them, and you will have some testing in this direction.<a name=38:32></a> May God give you all the wisdom, gentleness, meekness, and firmness, that you will need.<a name=38:33></a> You will accept, I am persuaded, all these remarks that I make, knowing well my weakness, for the love of Christ.<a name=38:34></a>

		Dearest G V Wigram, -- I have suffered lately from violent pain in the stomach which .<a name=40:1></a>.<a name=40:2></a>.<a name=40:3></a> sometimes four nights a week deprived me of rest .<a name=40:4></a>.<a name=40:5></a>.<a name=40:6></a> .<a name=40:7></a> Labouring in extreme heat, and the toil occasioned by the state of Lausanne -- where there was no life to walk stayed on the Lord, and if the evil shewed itself elsewhere none that could go and meet it -- so that I was pressed above strength, have occasioned this attack .<a name=40:8></a>.<a name=40:9></a>.<a name=40:10></a> .<a name=40:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, blessed be God, I have been sustained in great repose and unspeakable peace with Him, and that, notwithstanding many things, so that I am in anything but a disposition to complain.<a name=40:12></a> Many of my sleepless nights have been passed in joy or in profit, repassing sometimes the evil which magnifies this immense grace, unmeasurable grace of God; but more often I believe in immediate peace with Him, and sometimes prayer for others: of the two first, I scarce know which was the most blessed, though the latter of them surely the most agreeable and I suppose the best.<a name=40:13></a> If sometimes sorrow for others, as to others rather, passed across my mind, it was with an indescribably soothing feeling of the perfect goodness of God, while condemning myself, so that I could bless, and see evidently the hand of God in the thought .<a name=40:14></a>.<a name=40:15></a>.<a name=40:16></a> .<a name=40:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But on the whole, above all the circumstances of this place which pre-occupy all minds here, what is eternal, the thoughts of God for Jesus and for us have risen far above all; for me it has been a time of introduction into the rest of eternity of much blessing.<a name=40:18></a> It crossed my mind with much, with very great blessing latterly, in reading the Acts that we should be filled with the Holy Ghost, after the resurrection in glory as now.<a name=40:19></a> We are apt, at least, I, to regard it as a sort of necessary force for resisting the evil, and living above it here, but also shall it be the fulness of unspeakable power of enjoyment when all shall be glory and rest, the glory and rest of God on high.<a name=40:20></a> This in us, in man.<a name=40:21></a> There is something in this communion, and certainly I have learned it more here latterly, which is above all power of communication at least, till we get there, and then I suppose we shall have it (by the unity of the Spirit and glory) with one another as with God, with the Father and with the Son Jesus.<a name=40:22></a> It is blessed, even in feeble measure, to have the foretaste and earnest of it here.<a name=40:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I see all my weakness here -- weakness of conduct, and worse, weakness of faith -- but too evidently, and it humbles me exceedingly; alas, it has been very great.<a name=40:24></a> It is very distressing when one has the interest of the church and of the saints at heart, to see one's own want of faith and fidelity hindering the inflow of blessing which might be if one had it.<a name=40:25></a> Nothing presses on me and humbles me so much.<a name=40:26></a> Once too, since I have been here -- not that man has judged, or perhaps would judge -- my foot has slipped through want of caution, want of patient waiting on His will: but it was a profitable season, through divine and abounding grace, of utter humiliation and renewal to my soul.<a name=40:27></a> In truth, I am sometimes astonished at the goodness of God, when I see what wretches we are -- all the vileness and misery and pride and unbelief, which work and boil in the heart, and that for want of living in His presence, who is the source of all joy, and only strength of His people.<a name=40:28></a> And we are astonished at a little suffering, our own or the church's, which places us afresh in His presence.<a name=40:29></a> But I did not think when I began, to make you a long confession; perhaps it is a sign of good, for it is difficult to unlock my serried spirit.<a name=40:30></a> May abundant grace be with you and all the saints around you, and the power and strength of His presence .<a name=40:31></a>.<a name=40:32></a>.<a name=40:33></a> .<a name=40:34></a>

		[Mr E Maylon] [From the French.<a name=42:1></a>] VERY DEAR BROTHER, -- I wish to write you a few lines .<a name=42:2></a>.<a name=42:3></a>.<a name=42:4></a> .<a name=42:5></a> Some days have passed; I had to go to Lausanne, and to interrupt my letter.<a name=42:6></a> I rather fear, beloved brother, that we have failed somewhat in the energy of faith; I speak of myself.<a name=42:7></a> I fear I have lost some months of service, although I do not well know how; I thought of being in France almost at this time, and I see scarcely any probability of it as yet; perhaps I can say that Satan hindered me.<a name=42:8></a> I am not so much troubled about it, because G.<a name=42:9></a> and R.<a name=42:10></a>, who will be much better worth than I, will have gone there, but I am afraid of remaining here a while, because I am like a piece of furniture here.<a name=42:11></a> There has been blessing lately, more especially in the valley of St.<a name=42:12></a> Imier, where the work is fresh and happy; and in your own dear valley, which I hope soon to visit, they are going on very well, and are happy.<a name=42:13></a> Perhaps you may have heard that E.<a name=42:14></a> B.<a name=42:15></a> has been terribly beaten.<a name=42:16></a> I had a letter from him the day before yesterday, or the day previous.<a name=42:17></a> He cannot walk, or walks with difficulty; he rather fears it is a chastisement, because he did not go forward in France; it may be so, for when the Lord loves us He is jealous, and he shews it; still it will be for the blessing of our dear friend .<a name=42:18></a>.<a name=42:19></a>.<a name=42:20></a> .<a name=42:21></a> I do not know how our journey will succeed.<a name=42:22></a> I shall be very glad to have you with me, if our gracious Father should so arrange things.<a name=42:23></a> We are praying a little more, I hope, and through the grace of God this will be done.<a name=42:24></a> But what would comfort me, if I remain a little longer in Switzerland, would be to encourage those in the interior, for surely God would have it so in His grace: there is some need of it.<a name=42:25></a> May God teach us to give ourselves to prayer: it is easily forgotten in the work itself, and this is the first bad symptom for the work, as for the soul.<a name=42:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the ruin of the church, the theory came for me after the consciousness of it, and even now, the theory is but a small thing to my mind; it is the burden which one bears, and which has of late even weighed me down somewhat; but God, who raises up those who are cast down, has comforted me, and encouraged me a little, for indeed, the arm of Him who sustains us is not shortened, blessed be His name, nor is His love enfeebled.<a name=42:27></a> Thank God, we are in peace here; our meetings are in general happy, and even, blessed be God, very happy, and the brethren love each other, and but for some dissenting bickerings, there is nothing painful in the country at present; but in Vaud the activity of service is rather wanting.<a name=42:28></a>

		Dearest G V Wigram, -- A mouthful of English, and thoughts of the dear brethren, of whom I am almost obliged to deny myself the recollection, or I begin to hanker after them, and to be discontented with this part at least of the desert, for it is always this part that is disagreeable to us -- but I check this as unbelief and murmuring, which really is not in my heart, against the Lord; for it was not against Moses that Israel murmured.<a name=43:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In truth, there is an evident march of blessing here, though I have been kept to the wheel most painfully, excessively painful in its progress, in order that my joy might be in it and in the Lord, and not in myself.<a name=43:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Spirit of the Lord has put many dear brethren in movement, out of their cramped position towards better things, two or three ministers among others.<a name=43:3></a> Two have given their <i>dmission</i>, but all is in transition, though truly if feeble, yet real progress, so that it is difficult to speak of detail.<a name=43:4></a> There needs some one of a faith and energy that I have not, to act positively.<a name=43:5></a> I have served negatively in some measure, for Satan would have seized this moment of crisis by the means of Wesleyanism, and that as a system or generality, has not taken place.<a name=43:6></a> There are merely here and there a few Wesleyans, much less than I supposed.<a name=43:7></a> Probably, in the actual state of the church, it will make its proselytes, and those predisposed by their nature to a certain extent; but in general, it has failed, and though it has very much troubled by its want of integrity, and want of honest firmness of those who differed -- for independence of conduct is comparatively unknown in these countries -- it, when known, rather retrogrades than advances.<a name=43:8></a> The weak state of Christians and the existence of worldly Christianity and Nationalism always leave room for these energies, in which vast evil is mingled with some necessary good.<a name=43:9></a> God cannot leave them without the good, and the church is too corrupt to give the good pure, too enfeebled to separate it.<a name=43:10></a> The Lord will do His own work: the brethren who were on higher and simpler principles, were not, humanly speaking, of qualities calculated to spread and sanction it.<a name=43:11></a> The Lord works Himself.<a name=43:12></a> What was in the eye of man steady and of influence, was opposed, but God chooses the weak things, to shew that the truth and strength are His.<a name=43:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I, dear brother, am in a very critical position here, and desire much the prayers of the brethren for me for the Lord's glory.<a name=43:14></a> The brethren who laboured among the Dissenters here, feared the Wesleyanism, and could not come to their defence, standing in the gap.<a name=43:15></a> While they feared almost the determination with which it was opposed, they were yet glad that the battle was fought; but when necessarily this conflict produced other effects, many Nationals came more or less out, and united.<a name=43:16></a> They feared again; for the conflict which had hindered in a measure the progress of Wesleyanism, had produced effects of which they felt afraid to judge, and yet more held aloof.<a name=43:17></a> In the meanwhile, the jealousy of the Nationals was natural enough; many many Dissenters in heart desire the union of God's children; others are excessively irritated, and hence, most of the others, or many at least, are timid as to committing themselves with their brethren who are opposed at Lausanne.<a name=43:18></a> Then there are now the old Dissenters, partly Wesleyans, among the women, though having protested as a body against it, some saying the pastor who introduced it, but who now denounces it, is their pastor, and some not -- and in the meanwhile the principle of leaving their churches, placing the others in a dilemma how to recognise this body: meanwhile they look on.<a name=43:19></a> In one place the dissident body is dissolved, or consists of five discontented Wesleyans, and there is a meeting where all the Christians can, and mostly do, unite to break bread with one of the ministers, also whom I mentioned -- very happy.<a name=43:20></a> At Vevey, Nationals, ex-nationals and Dissenters meet the last Monday of the month to break bread -- very happy.<a name=43:21></a> It is a beginning.<a name=43:22></a> There, also, another National minister has left; a third has quitted elsewhere, but the Conseil d'tat has begged him to wait awhile till they see what they have to do, which he does for the moment gratuitously -- a faithful, upright man, but hitherto buried in scholastic learning, Fathers, etc.<a name=43:23></a>, but I believe he makes progress out of this lore, and to him that hath shall more be given.<a name=43:24></a> Here the old Dissenters, and some who thought to seize the occasion to establish themselves, hate me cordially, at least, the leaders.<a name=43:25></a> You will understand by all this what has detained me here, though my judgment is, by more faith I might have got off sooner, for I am very weak in faith.<a name=43:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Adieu, dear brother.<a name=43:27></a> Pray all for me, that having done the will of God, I may also, when He sees good, see you in peace, .<a name=43:28></a>.<a name=43:29></a>.<a name=43:30></a> You will see from what I have said, it is difficult to give much account of what passes here -- all is so in transition.<a name=43:31></a> There needs, I feel, some one more faithful a great deal than I; but yet I doubt sometimes if others of you would have borne with the inconsistencies with many true and precious principles which accompany this state of transition; perhaps you would have been thus more blessed in your fidelity than in thus bearing with what I have supported here in these things.<a name=43:32></a> The Lord turn all I trust to good.<a name=43:33></a> Again I say, pray for me.<a name=43:34></a> Salute cordially all the beloved brethren, whom I remember with all my heart in the Lord .<a name=43:35></a>.<a name=43:36></a>.<a name=43:37></a> .<a name=43:38></a>

		[From the French.<a name=47:1></a>] G V Wigram, I do not quite like that expression, "Christ has obtained justification from God," because it presents God as unwilling and even opposed to the thing, while it is the will and the heart of God which has provided the sacrifice and all.<a name=47:2></a> It is true that the righteousness of God required expiation and the sacrifice of Christ.<a name=47:3></a> Still it is He whose love has provided for our needs in this respect.<a name=47:4></a> And He it is who justifies.<a name=47:5></a> (Compare Zechariah 3.<a name=47:6></a>) The Epistle to the Hebrews speaks rather of our acceptance under the form of our presentation to Him, of sanctification in an external sense.<a name=47:7></a> "That he might sanctify the people by his own blood.<a name=47:8></a>" He has also perfected them; they can stand in His presence, as being His according to the perfection of the sanctuary, without reproach, without spot.<a name=47:9></a> Justification is the idea of a tribunal, of a judge, so to speak.<a name=47:10></a> The Epistle to the Hebrews speaks of the sanctuary, and of presenting us there

	<div class="paragraph">
		The foundation is always the same; but we can look at it in many ways, and each one gives us more light as to the perfection of the work of Christ, and the results of that work which we enjoy.<a name=47:11></a> 1 Peter 1: 19 speaks rather in the sense of redemption, of being taken by a ransom out of the hands of the enemy.<a name=47:12></a> The obedience of Christ during His life tended to the perfection of the sacrifice; it was not expiatory, but perfectly acceptable.<a name=47:13></a> It was a question of the acceptability of His Person as necessary to His work, but that obedience was not expiatory.<a name=47:14></a> He would have remained alone if the corn of wheat had not fallen into the ground; but His entire obedience rendered Him perfectly pleasing to God, as it also was itself.<a name=47:15></a> (See Philippians 2.<a name=47:16></a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Under the form of justification, the Epistle to the Romans is the one which most formally treats of the subject of our acceptance.<a name=47:17></a> What I meant by making use of the expression, "Christ has obtained our justification," will be understood by comparing the manner in which this epistle is expressed (chapter 3: 24), "Being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.<a name=47:18></a>" You see how it is presented, as flowing from the free grace of God.<a name=47:19></a> This is important for the state of the soul, and for the clear understanding of grace.<a name=47:20></a>

		[From the French.<a name=48:1></a>] G V Wigram, To apprehend aright the place of the law is a difficult thing, because we must be fully led by the Holy Spirit in order not to be ourselves, in some sort, under law, as to our feelings at least.<a name=48:2></a> We must have rightly seized the power of the work and resurrection of Jesus, otherwise one would be lawless if one were not under law.<a name=48:3></a> We are in nowise under the law.<a name=48:4></a> Grace does not recognise any participation of the law in our hearts; but how is this, if we acknowledge the law as good?<a name=48:5></a> Because Christ exhausted it in His death.<a name=48:6></a> He was under the law up to His death, and in His death; but evidently He is not so now; He may employ the law to judge those who have been under the law, but we are united to Him.<a name=48:7></a> As Adam was not head of the old race until after his fall, so Christ is only Head of the new race as risen from among the dead.<a name=48:8></a> He places them in His own position as a risen Man; they begin with Christ there.<a name=48:9></a> They quite acknowledge the power of the law, but in that it has put Jesus to death, there where it has lost all its power, and its dominion over the soul.<a name=48:10></a> We belong to another.<a name=48:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We can employ the law, if there be need, against the wicked, because, having the divine nature, we can handle the law, and it cannot inflict its mortal wound upon the divine nature from which it has emanated.<a name=48:12></a> We can shew where man is if under the law, in order thereby to bring out the perfection of redemption; it is what the apostle does in Romans and Galatians, in order to make it clear that we are no longer under the law, because we are dead with Christ.<a name=48:13></a> Through the law we are dead to the law; we are crucified with Christ.<a name=48:14></a> A Gentile was never really under the law.<a name=48:15></a> In becoming a Christian he takes Christ at a point where He has done with the law; but, having received the Spirit of Christ, he has no longer need of the law to discern the perfection of redemption: he has intelligence to understand the things accomplished in the history of the Messiah -- His perfect work.<a name=48:16></a> But this is far from being clear in the mind of Christians, for in fact, the greater part among them have made of Christianity a law, and have put themselves under the law.<a name=48:17></a> They must come out thence in order to enjoy peace; but for them, the discussion as to what the law is is a very important thing, and very opportune on that account.<a name=48:18></a> Besides, the human heart so naturally places itself under law, that it is very important for every soul to be well enlightened on the subject.<a name=48:19></a> The law, let us always remember, reveals to us nothing of God, except that a law implies a judge; it gives the measure of our responsibility: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God and thy neighbour;" that is the law.<a name=48:20></a> It may be said that the gospel gives new motives for our fulfilment of the law; but these motives are drawn from a fact which gives to Christ all that right over our hearts to which the law could lay claim, and by death puts an end to the power of the latter, for we are dead and risen with Christ.<a name=48:21></a> We shall do or avoid many of the things found in the law, and the summary of it which has been given us remains the principle, or rather the fruit of the life of Christ in us.<a name=48:22></a> It is now fulfilled in all that flows from that life, but we are in nowise under the law, for we are one with Christ, and Christ is not under the law.<a name=48:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The law not only condemns conduct, but men.<a name=48:24></a> The law does not only say, "Cursed is everything," but "Cursed is every <i>one</i> who continueth not.<a name=48:25></a>" Thus we must be under the curse if we are under the law.<a name=48:26></a> But it is because we are not under the law that we can make use of it, if needs be.<a name=48:27></a> The Jews attempted to employ it against the adulterous woman, but they were under the law, in the flesh.<a name=48:28></a> The law pierced their hearts to death and condemnation.<a name=48:29></a> Christ made use of it, or at least allowed it its efficacy, because, although He was born under the law, it could not touch Him for condemnation, the life of God in Him being perfect.<a name=48:30></a> United to Him in resurrection we can make use of it, because we are beyond its reach by the death and resurrection of Christ, enjoying His life in our souls.<a name=48:31></a> This is why people are always more or less under the law, until they have understood the resurrection of Christ, and also whenever the flesh obscures the power of our redemption.<a name=48:32></a> I hope that you will be able to understand these few remarks.<a name=48:33></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With regard to the Epistle to the Philippians, it presents another very interesting feature -- the affliction and the personal experience of the apostle.<a name=48:34></a> He looks at the church as deprived of his care, and he himself is oppressed for the time by the power of Satan.<a name=48:35></a> Thus, in a very touching and very powerful manner, he enters into all that concerns the conflict of the church, and all that is important for it during the period of its abandonment: he also presents the graces which would prevent it from falling into those troubles which sprang up consequent upon the absence of the apostle.<a name=48:36></a> Hence the great value of this epistle for the present time.<a name=48:37></a> They were beginning to preach Christ in a spirit of contention, not to be of the same mind, to murmur.<a name=48:38></a> He shews in what the riches and graces of Christ consist, especially necessary for such a state of things, a state, alas!<a name=48:39></a> which has ripened much since then.<a name=48:40></a> Why should I say, Alas?<a name=48:41></a> for all this will turn to salvation, and shews that the coming of Jesus is nearer.<a name=48:42></a>

		Dearest G V Wigram, -- As to all speaking, if the brethren prefer all meetings of brethren as such, it is all very well; I have no objection; I would meet cordially with them; but when they do not meet corporately as brethren, then I act on my individual responsibility to God -- I individualise myself.<a name=50:1></a> If I find it profitable to associate another with me, as Barnabas or Silas (Paul chose Silas), it is all well; but I count it of the very last importance to maintain individual responsibility, while insisting on unity and discipline.<a name=50:2></a> Counsel the individual, exercise discipline if needed, refuse him your room if he preaches error; but where there is unity and discipline in form, if individual responsibility be not recognised therewith, it becomes a petty Rome, and worse, from being narrower.<a name=50:3></a> Where charity is warm, there is no difficulty.<a name=50:4></a> If brethren who have a room, desire to use it only for corporate meetings, as I have said, it is all well, and I admit the liberty of the Spirit edifying by whom He will; but my position in the body of Christ for service in the responsibility of individual gift is between me and Christ, where not exercised in a corporate meeting; I dare not forego this responsibility (woe to me if I preach not!<a name=50:5></a>); and no one can meddle with it -- he meddles with the prerogative of Christ.<a name=50:6></a> In the assembly, the order of the assembly, or Christ by the Spirit in that, is supreme; out of the assembly, I act on my own responsibility to the Lord.<a name=50:7></a> If I have five talents, I do not necessarily club with him who has two.<a name=50:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I admit fully, alongside of this, all godly counsel; and all discipline as to error or misconduct.<a name=50:9></a> Even so, you cannot help a man's preaching alone; only you can refuse to recognise him, or warn, or the like.<a name=50:10></a> I attach all possible importance to this individual responsibility (repeating yet again, all just accompanying principle): I would not be of any body where it was touched; I dare not, for I should do just what Rome has -- set up something between me and Christ.<a name=50:11></a> If the brethren do not like to lend me their place of meeting, where I may exercise my gift on this responsibility, I resist not; it is merely a question of rooms, or of wisdom; perhaps they may be wiser in this than myself.<a name=50:12></a> The question arose at -- .<a name=50:13></a> I replied, as above, that if the brethren did not like me to preach on my own responsibility in the room, and would have only open corporate meetings, I had no more to say, I would hire another; but out of the corporate meetings I was Christ's servant, and I recognised no right in another to meddle with this responsibility, saving discipline if that were needed.<a name=50:14></a> The difficulty disappeared, as it always does where there is fidelity; though humbleness alone can save us getting out of one ditch into another.<a name=50:15></a>

		As to heresies, I feel a difference between one who, for want of light or from early prejudice, cannot get rid of error, and one who propagates it ever so secretly (for in general where there is an evil will, it is secretly propagated at first), because then there is the love of error, and the will of the flesh is at work, they are the fruits of the flesh.<a name=56:5></a> What is written as to heresy -- not as to every one that is in error, even where the error is grave -- is, "after the first and second admonition reject.<a name=56:6></a>" But I doubt not, you have been better directed of the Lord in waiting on Him, than anything I could thus write, but I believe these principles correct.<a name=56:7></a> But all these exercises are good.<a name=56:8></a> Surely it would be happier never to give the Lord occasion thus to exercise us; but it is much more merciful to be put through the exercises, which brings out faithfulness, than to be left in what separates us from the Lord -- far, far better.<a name=56:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the second point, that of teaching meetings, if I remember, the same difficulty had occurred before, but it appears to me the matter is very simple.<a name=56:10></a> I scarcely understand the difficulty, as it seems to me to deny the exercise of a gift which I am bound to exercise according to my responsibility to Christ.<a name=56:11></a> As to the circumstances of its exercise, they are comparatively immaterial.<a name=56:12></a> That one teach, or that more than one take part if united in work, is a matter for them to judge of, under the guidance of the Holy Ghost.<a name=56:13></a> Paul and Barnabas assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people.<a name=56:14></a> He who has the gift of teaching is responsible to Christ for the exercise of his gift; it may be exercised in private; in the meeting together of brethren, if so led, on the Lord's day; or he may assemble them to teach them if he has the capacity for it, for he is acting then on the responsibility which lies on him to trade with his talent.<a name=56:15></a> That this should be done with the concurrence and in the unity of the brethren, is natural where charity exists, and desirable: but if one has a gift of teaching, one is accountable for its exercise in charity where it can be a blessing to the church.<a name=56:16></a> Only, if in the assembly he act in the flesh, that, not his gift, is a subject of discipline -- as when tongues were used for vain glory.<a name=56:17></a> It is a question of edifying.<a name=56:18></a> Charity uses a gift for edifying, but charity is bound to use the gift for edifying.<a name=56:19></a> Besides, if there are brethren who in conscience do not approve of it, their path is easy, not to sanction it by their presence; but they ought not to make their conscience or scruple the law of others' conduct, where it is a matter of spiritual judgment.<a name=56:20></a>

		There has been so much blessing in France, that I cannot regret not having got home to England, though indeed I desired it.<a name=56:21></a> Since then I have done little here, having been ill, and I doubt that the Lord has much for me to do here, but the brethren who read with me are all blessed in their work in this country, French Switzerland, and there is awakening in all parts.<a name=56:22></a> Yet I long to be back in England.<a name=56:23></a> I suppose still that I may make my journey back by France, where doors were more and more open to me the last time I was there.<a name=56:24></a> May I be only the Lord's servant, and that within, as well as, and before, being it without.<a name=56:25></a> I have been in general happy, and how otherwise with fresh grace; yet I have seen several times lately my deplorable weakness.<a name=56:26></a> Yet having been ill, I have been astonished how deeply I felt utter and entire separation to the Lord.<a name=56:27></a> Work more or less occupied me with things and people here; when incapable of it, as I have been latterly almost entirely, I found I had nothing but Christ and His importance beyond all our highest and fondest and most sincere thoughts: it was a sort of experience morally of death, not perhaps all its force on conscience, but all on my position.<a name=56:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Our brethren who have died lately have been in sweetest peace, and have felt in a peculiar manner the importance of the Lord's coming for the church, even when dying, and sorrowed only, where sorrow was, at not having more entirely acted on all principles they had received.<a name=56:29></a> The awakening produced by these principles in Switzerland and France is really deeply interesting.<a name=56:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The anxiety of dear -- 's followers to propagate his views, seems to me the flesh.<a name=56:31></a> Some brethren and sisters here have the same difficulty, but it does not seem to me as flowing from or accompanied by increased spirituality, but a tendency to bring down the mind to earth.<a name=56:32></a> But I have never combated it much.<a name=56:33></a> My mind has opened out to many wider views and details.<a name=56:34></a> I find many more classes of saints and glory in the Apocalypse than heretofore, though all blessed.<a name=56:35></a> It may be some will pass through, but I am more than ever confirmed that it is not presented to our faith, but the contrary, and that the faithful will be kept from it.<a name=56:36></a> If some pass through it, it would make a difficulty for those who could not separate the signs of special blessing there, from the evidence of greater faithfulness which made us escape it.<a name=56:37></a> This, I believe, happens often.<a name=56:38></a> Lot experienced mercies not manifested to Abraham in the same way, and the proofs of righteousness are occasions of sorrow if we go far enough.<a name=56:39></a> He vexed his righteous soul; and the Lord knew how to keep.<a name=56:40></a> Does this identify his case with Abraham?<a name=56:41></a> But farewell.<a name=56:42></a> May the brethren pray for me, for I am a very weak vessel, that feel often my want of discernment in the midst of, for me, an arduous responsibility.<a name=56:43></a> Grace, mercy and peace be with you.<a name=56:44></a> Salute all the brethren.<a name=56:45></a> May they be kept in lowliness and peace.<a name=56:46></a>

		Dear Mrs.<a name=59:1></a> Darnell, -- You must not be surprised at the seeming long delay in answering your letter, as it has followed me to Lausanne and Geneva.<a name=59:2></a> Perhaps the good Lord has given you peace already -- at least, before you receive this; but in case it be not so, I answer according to the light God has given me.<a name=59:3></a> In the first place, I beseech you to count on the goodness of God, of our God as He has revealed Himself in Christ, and that notwithstanding feelings which may arise.<a name=59:4></a> Indeed, I see that He has already given you to do it in a measure.<a name=59:5></a> I know it is difficult, impossible to us, not to judge of God by what we feel in ourselves, but it is evident it is not the truth.<a name=59:6></a> Our feelings are not the measure of what He is towards us, but to us they often are (when in the state your mind is in).<a name=59:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the next place I admit freely, that when the conscience is powerfully wrought upon, it is quite possible that many physical and nervous sentiments may accompany them, which to the world, and perhaps to doctors, appears the whole matter, while they are really (while I quite admit the possibility of their existence) but the mere indices of deeper and much more important feelings: and it is of these that I desire to speak.<a name=59:8></a> It is sad indeed to smother up our feelings towards God which concern our eternal interests, because they produce certain passing painful effects.<a name=59:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And here I will say a word as to -- : I feel thankful that you are fallen into the hands of one who recognises as he does the word of God.<a name=59:10></a> There is a measure of truth in what he says; it is true that we have to rest on the written word; there he is quite right, but he does not, for I know well the system in which his mind has been taught, recognise the effects and working of the Spirit of God in the soul, as the revelation of God [teaches] and requires that we should; so that though he be quite right in exhorting you to rest on the written record, he could not rightly interpret what passes in your soul, nor make sufficient allowance for the work of the Holy Ghost.<a name=59:11></a> Nor could you perhaps distinguish now quite between what was a physical effect and the real inward work.<a name=59:12></a> Praying God to give you peace and calm as to this even outward physical part, I will apply myself to that which is of God.<a name=59:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not surprising when the Spirit of God takes a soul in hand to convince it of sin, to change its whole course and object, to give it a life it had not before, and judge thereon every thought which has had a place in it previously -- it is not surprising that in such a case there should be wonderful upsetting and havoc.<a name=59:14></a> It is astonishing when one comes to know what is really done, that so many are brought peacefully to know themselves, the Lord, and His grace.<a name=59:15></a> And here suffer me to add, dear -- , not as a reproach, but on the contrary, as confirming the hope that it is the Lord's own work in your soul, that called as you had been long before, and that call dropped as it were for so long a season, that when the Lord re-visits a soul and takes up His work which has been neglected (I will not say slighted), it is generally with much more painful convictions -- with a hand that acts in love, but as forced to make the soul feel the urgency of the case, and that it must pay attention to God's hand and call.<a name=59:16></a> And when the Lord acts thus in grace -- is forced by our folly thus to act -- Satan would seek the occasion to tell us it is too late, that the Lord is hard and acts harshly, just because we have forced Him to act in a manner to make us feel the position we are in and our need.<a name=59:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But be of good cheer; the Lord makes all work together for good to them that love Him.<a name=59:18></a> Your case is not extraordinary.<a name=59:19></a> Often souls are attracted by the grace of Jesus, or some religious impression, but the conscience slightly touched; a season of neglect ensues, and then the passages which speak of turning back are strongly applied to the conscience, instead of those which speak of ordinary evil, as in the case when the conscience is reached at the beginning.<a name=59:20></a> The enemy always seeks to profit by these convictions, when he can no longer hold the soul in bondage by carelessness, and would drive it to despair and hard thoughts of God.<a name=59:21></a> The Lord does not hinder this, for it adds to the seriousness of the convictions, but He is faithful in the end to bring us out of it.<a name=59:22></a> If our imagination or feelings are at work, our joys and distress will be more apparent and acute, for the flesh mingles with this also, though the ground work be real.<a name=59:23></a> When you know Christ and yourself better, you will be better able to discern between what is accessory merely, and real; but it is of little importance to you now, and God is faithful, though you know that when Peter denied Christ with execrations, Christ had prayed for him that his faith might not fail.<a name=59:24></a> It was permitted, because Peter had need of this sad lesson as to himself, and this painfully acquired knowledge of himself was the means of his being able to strengthen even his brethren, for all that humbles us is good; but I desire to remark in the case of Peter, that behind all this scene there was the intercession of Christ which secured the recovery of Peter and the maintenance of his faith, his confidence, and reliance on the goodness of God, instead of falling into despair as Judas; as he says afterwards, "If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.<a name=59:25></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is a deeper work than all these feelings; not so acute perhaps, but which judges sin in the light of God's grace.<a name=59:26></a> Further, until the mind gets based upon the truth that <i>all is grace</i>, and that thus it is by the <i>obedience of One</i> that many are made righteous, the soul which is sincere is necessarily under the law, and occupied with itself -- thinks as you, that it is unworthy to follow Him, and the like.<a name=59:27></a> Surely you are unworthy to follow Him, and the Lord is pleased to lead you to make the discovery of this humbling truth.<a name=59:28></a> Seeing that we are lost (and you will be tormented till you are completely convinced of that) we think that there is no hope, when it is exactly then that the gospel begins, for the Son of man came to seek and to save those that are lost, and He has done the whole work that saves them.<a name=59:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You must not attach too much importance to your joy, though it were real, for it never reached the height of its object; nor to your distress, though it may have been an effect of the operation of the Spirit convincing you of sin, which after all you cannot measure more than the joy; nor to your indifference, more painful in some sort than the distress, and by which the enemy often tempts us.<a name=59:30></a> God has weighed all that joy shall be for us; He has weighed all that sin is, all your thoughts seen beforehand, all your indifference -- miserable as all this proves us to be; and knowing beforehand all that we are and all our sin, He has given Christ for us, who has charged Himself with <i>all</i>, and us <i>such as we are</i>, and has accomplished without us all that was needed by the justice and love of God.<a name=59:31></a> It is absolutely accomplished; you can add nothing by joy or sorrow to the perfect work of Christ.<a name=59:32></a> All these exercises of soul may be very useful to bring us to the point of acknowledging our own nothingness, so that Christ may have His first place in our minds by faith, but they can add nothing to Him.<a name=59:33></a> Your peace will come from a calm and holy conviction that you are nothing, and that He is all, and that the Lord knew all that you were, and because you were all this, took your place in responsibility and suffered for you.<a name=59:34></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will say, but I have neglected Christ after being awakened.<a name=59:35></a> It is possible, and it is very sad; nay, more, as I have said, this gives a handle to the enemy to torment us, but does not change the efficacy of the blood and work of Christ <i>in God's eyes</i>, and that is what gives peace.<a name=59:36></a> It is not what you think of Christ's work, but what God thinks of it, that saves.<a name=59:37></a> Your knowledge of what God thinks of it, by faith, gives <i>peace</i>.<a name=59:38></a> God says to Israel in Egypt, not when you see the blood, I will pass over, but "when <i>I</i> see the blood.<a name=59:39></a>" He it is that has been offended, He it is that judges, and He it is that <i>has accepted</i> the ransom in justice as He gave it in love.<a name=59:40></a> He is faithful and <i>just</i> to forgive us.<a name=59:41></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As we may confound sometimes the acuteness of our feelings with the spiritual judgment of sin, almost always at the outset we confound the work of the Spirit and the work of Christ.<a name=59:42></a> Each has its place in the saved, but they must not be confounded.<a name=59:43></a> The Spirit of God may humble, convict us, reprove within and thus distress us, or give us joy, and often we set about to judge of all this in order to know our acceptance with God.<a name=59:44></a> But these things, though they have their place in the mind of the redeemed, are not the ground of his peace.<a name=59:45></a> Christ has made peace by the blood of the cross.<a name=59:46></a> Christ has done all, and has left us nothing but thanksgiving and praise.<a name=59:47></a> If some one has paid my debts, my sorrow at the folly that contracted them, or my joy at their being discharged, adds nothing whatever to the payment of the debt, though both be natural and just.<a name=59:48></a> It is sometimes hard to esteem all our feelings as nothing, but it is only a remains of self; but only think what it cost the Son of God in undergoing the wrath of God, and we shall feel on one hand the perfect security of our justification, and the nothingness of all our feelings compared with what our sin really was in the sight of God; but He remembers it no more, as He has said.<a name=59:49></a> If Christ had not completely discharged and effaced it, He could not be in heaven, for He could not sit at the right hand of God charged with our sins, though He was charged with them on the cross.<a name=59:50></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If your heart demands, But how do I know that I have part in all this?<a name=59:51></a> I answer, with the word of the Lord which abides for ever, that whoso believeth in Him.<a name=59:52></a> That all might be grace, God has willed that it should be by faith, and though faith produces immense effects, it adds nothing to the thing it believes.<a name=59:53></a> Christ and the efficacy of His work must be, and be before God, all that I am called to believe them to be, before I believe it.<a name=59:54></a> The feelings and distress through which we pass are very important, but only in order to bring us to this, and peace and joy are found in a humble and lowly sense of sin, and of the infinite -- [copy defective.<a name=59:55></a>]

		[Mrs Monthenez] [From the French.<a name=63:1></a>] VERY DEAR SISTER, -- Here I am then, in this vast and horrible town, but led by the good hand of Him who never fails in His faithfulness, and the haste that I make to let you have tidings of us, ought to assure you on the one hand that I count on the interest you have in receiving them, and on the other hand, that I do not forget Switzerland.<a name=63:2></a> In fact, when I arrived here, I felt myself a stranger, and much more at home in Switzerland than here.<a name=63:3></a> It was not from lack of affection on the part of the brethren, far from it, for their reception was affectionate, could not be more so.<a name=63:4></a> I felt my unworthiness, and attributed it as much to the interest that they take in the work in Switzerland, as to what was more personal.<a name=63:5></a> It is not as a compliment that I say this.<a name=63:6></a> But they had prayed much for the work in Switzerland, and naturally that had identified me with that work.<a name=63:7></a>

		We had a blessed meeting at Liverpool; I think that the brethren enjoyed themselves more there than at preceding ones; perhaps less of fresh knowledge, but more solid and more serious, and new souls that found there precious links with the brethren, several localities being newly opened.<a name=65:14></a> Brotherly love was without restraint, and very real and blessed, so that we had indeed something to bless God for.<a name=65:15></a> The brethren returned like the Israelites from the dedication (2 Chronicles 7: 10), though it were but an earnest, and even in a poor and miserable assembly.<a name=65:16></a> The field also is an open one, and the testimony absolutely sought for.<a name=65:17></a> Besides, I ought to tell you this, that whilst hurrying to return to the Continent, I am deeply [convinced] that it is a moment that the testimony is urgently demanded in England, and I think that I must return to work here, that at least a testimony may be borne by the grace of God, before Puseyism possess the country, and whilst religious liberty remains to us, which I do not think will last too long.<a name=65:18></a> The dissenters can do nothing; they hold meetings to know what to do, and what they possess is slipping from their hands before their eyes; they feel it, throw themselves right and left, and avow that all is lost, when they dare to say so.<a name=65:19></a> Externally the country is becoming nationalised, and nationalism is becoming Puseyism, and Puseyism no longer hides itself in its Romanist tendencies.<a name=65:20></a> It is no longer a question of searching the prophecies in quietness to know what should come to pass, but of acting, of working while it is day; it is a sombre picture no doubt.<a name=65:21></a>

		The country is prosperous in its temporal affairs; they are building fine Gothic churches everywhere; they are making immense collections for the education of poor manufacturers; but the truth, some moral principle, some energy of faith that can meet the evil, is lacking everywhere.<a name=65:22></a> Such is England!<a name=65:23></a> I believe it will be my duty to work there a little, without however, giving up Switzerland or other countries.<a name=65:24></a> There is need also of caring for the sheep; perhaps one may be able to do little, but this little ought to be done.<a name=65:25></a> What happiness to await the precious Saviour, and to know that His glory that one has so desired, so wished for, is drawing near; what happiness that the dark clouds that are about to burst upon the world will but discover this Sun of righteousness too long hidden (though that has been His grace), this Sun with which we are but one, united to Him according to the counsels of His love!<a name=65:26></a> Truly this makes us lift up our heads; besides, we shall be kept as in the hollow of His hand, of the hand of Him to whom all power is given in heaven and on earth.<a name=65:27></a> May my dear Lausanne sisters know how to await thus our precious Saviour, and you yourselves, my dear sisters, among others.<a name=65:28></a> Perhaps it is their lot to await Him in peace and quietness, in happy works of charity in the shade (I greatly envy them in this respect) -- mine to be compelled to face the winds and the waves of this stormy world, although it be with the Lord, so that all goes well; our life and our portion are in Him.<a name=65:29></a> You see what a piece of paper I have taken, without noticing it.<a name=65:30></a> I cannot re-write my letter.<a name=65:31></a> May peace, mercy and grace be abundantly with you all .<a name=65:32></a>.<a name=65:33></a>.<a name=65:34></a> .<a name=65:35></a> God be with you.<a name=65:36></a>

		[From the French.<a name=67:1></a>] VERY DEAR BRETHREN, -- My heart has joy in turning towards Lausanne, where God has given me to work so long amongst you.<a name=67:2></a> And in looking back, in order to reflect upon all the time I spent among you, and upon the work which has been done at Lausanne, I find indeed that for which to bless God; and I think I may say, much loved brethren, that while owning many shortcomings in myself before God, I have never sought anything amongst you but the glory of Christ, and the welfare of you all.<a name=67:3></a> I had much upon my heart to say a few words to you the Sunday before my departure, but I had not courage for it, and could not bear the idea of turning looks towards me when we had been occupied with the Lord.<a name=67:4></a> At any rate, I felt the need of pouring out my heart just a little, and saying thus to you a word of affection and of thankfulness.<a name=67:5></a> I suppose, dear and much loved brethren, that with more faith, and thus more knowledge of the will of God, one would have done more for His glory, and for the manifestation of life and the power of His grace in the assembly of His children, for His glory in the church.<a name=67:6></a> Notwithstanding, I do not doubt, on the contrary I see, and praise God for it, that He has acted in the midst of us, and that it was His work, and I am astonished sometimes at His grace and goodness.<a name=67:7></a> Alas, with more faith, one would have much more still of His glory; but if we think of what we are, we shall bless God from the abundance of our hearts every hour, that He intervenes -- and those who are working, so much more than the rest, because they know with what vessels of clay the work is done, and all the shortcomings of their own hearts.<a name=67:8></a> At all events, dear friends, as I have said to you, I have the sweet consciousness of having only sought your welfare; and now let me urge on you to seek union among yourselves, and to attach yourselves to one another, seeking the presence of God, which makes the strength of His own; that will be (be well assured of it) your strength and the means of His glory.<a name=67:9></a> Do not forsake your holy assemblings; profit by that which God gives, while seeking His presence more than any other thing.<a name=67:10></a> For my part, I believe that there is something yet to be gained with regard to the assembly.<a name=67:11></a> The principles which I believe to be the truth in our present position having been laid down, I believe that we shall have to seek more union, and more being together, and it is to this I shall apply myself, if God permit me to see you again, as I much hope, and that before long; for to tell you the truth, I am astonished to find to what a degree I am a stranger here, and the distance from Lausanne, instead of separating me in heart, has made me feel how much I was bound to you all.<a name=67:12></a> I believe fully that my journey was according to God's will, and thus I am convinced that it will be in blessing to you all, as to myself.<a name=67:13></a> It is a very sweet thing to feel oneself conducted by His good hand.<a name=67:14></a> I am trying also to get rid of the feeling of being a stranger here, while at the same time being content to feel myself a stranger everywhere.<a name=67:15></a> My stay upon the Continent has been blessed to me in every respect, and that one among others.<a name=67:16></a> Thanks be to God, the affection of the brethren is stronger than ever, also they have prayed much for the work in Switzerland and in France.<a name=67:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In general, the work here has extended greatly, but it seems to me, from the little I have seen, that in the following out of that, the links need to be made firmer.<a name=67:18></a> There are places where blessing continues and increases; some, where the enemy has sought to make ravages, but God, I believe, has turned his efforts to good, although the circumstances were humiliating for all, for hitherto the hand of God has been in a remarkable manner with the brethren.<a name=67:19></a> Let Him be blessed for it, and may they also be kept in humility; without that assuredly He will resist them to their face.<a name=67:20></a> I hope, dear brethren, if I come back to Lausanne, according to my thought, by the goodness of God, to apply myself more to making fast the links between brethren individually, and to be myself more amongst them.<a name=67:21></a> I have sought it when I was habitually in the town, for latterly I was often absent, but I was not yet content, and I will try to make arrangements so as to be able to meet more often among ourselves.<a name=67:22></a> I believe that will be the means of strengthening love, of making us all grow, even in knowledge, and of giving more strength and unity for the glory of Christ.<a name=67:23></a> Meanwhile, I do not doubt, dear brethren, that God will bless you.<a name=67:24></a> Seek to tighten the links of charity among yourselves; without making any great external appearance, but in simplicity, attach yourselves to each other, while seeking one sole end, the welfare of all -- the being together, staying yourselves on God, and in the seriousness which His presence gives.<a name=67:25></a> His presence always gives humility, one is more firm, but self is annihilated when one is before Him.<a name=67:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I beg you to think much of the younger brethren and those less confirmed in the faith, and to surround them with your care and your affection, it is just they who have need of it.<a name=67:27></a> I have several upon my heart, but I leave it to your charity to think of them.<a name=67:28></a> God adds His blessing when one acts in charity, and that is not only the simple effect of our cares, but He is Himself in the power of His blessing and feeblest hearts are established.<a name=67:29></a> I am sure that my absence will be for blessing to you.<a name=67:30></a> I have full confidence of it before God in looking to Him.<a name=67:31></a> Adieu, dear brethren.<a name=67:32></a> Be united, walk in love and unity more than ever, as we have sought to do it in our feebleness, and God will establish you, and add to you still more.<a name=67:33></a> Do not think that I attach much importance to myself in venturing thus to give you all these counsels, or rather exhortations, but I desire your welfare, and the glory of the Lord Jesus, because in my feebleness I love you much.<a name=67:34></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Receive this at least, as a testimony of my affection.<a name=67:35></a> I thank you much, dear brethren, for all that I met amongst you.<a name=67:36></a> I am very sensible of it.<a name=67:37></a> I salute each one in particular, whilst in my memory passing you all again before me, and ask much your prayers for all the church.<a name=67:38></a> May God bless you, in keeping you in the way in which the Spirit leads those who belong to Christ, in unity and in light, and may it be given to each one to seek to perfect his sanctification in the fear of the Lord.<a name=67:39></a>

		[Mons.<a name=72:1></a> Eynard] [From the French.<a name=72:2></a>] DEAR BROTHER, -- I received your letter, and I thank you for it.<a name=72:3></a> I found it here on my return from a round I have just been making, with blessing to my soul.<a name=72:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I reply to the principal subjects of which you there speak to me.<a name=72:5></a> You are mistaken in supposing that I am acquainted with the details of what has gone on at verse I have, of course, heard something said about it, but nothing to make me thoroughly know what belongs to the case.<a name=72:6></a> However, I do not much mind as to that, but I wished to reserve any judgment it would be needful for me to form, until I might see the persons who were interested in the judgment which might be passed upon them.<a name=72:7></a> It appears to me to be the most straightforward thing.<a name=72:8></a> Moreover, I do not at all pretend to judge of all the circumstances and all the conduct of those whom I meet in going from place to place.<a name=72:9></a> In charity, I may apply myself to it, but I do not feel myself under obligation to solve everything that every one's mode of proceeding may have occasioned.<a name=72:10></a> From the little I have heard said, I believe the flesh has intermingled itself with the affairs of verse It is an extremely sad thing, I deplore it in the result, both on the one side and on the other.<a name=72:11></a> Before God I deplore it, but if you think flesh which knows better how to conceal itself, which is more agreeable and less clashing, more adroit in directing its way across circumstances in order not to displease -- not to make itself manifestly culpable -- if you think, I say, that such flesh pleases me more than that which, less yielding, knows not how thus to regulate itself according to circumstances, you are mistaken; and I think, dear brother, if you reflect upon it before God, you will not be slow to recognise that it is not more pleasing to God either.<a name=72:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I deplore all these things, but the judgment that man passes thereupon matters very little to me.<a name=72:13></a> I am sure, before God, that it is often entirely false; and do you believe, my dear -- (and I love you much, and I hope I shall love you, even if you should put your threat into execution), that to threaten me with withdrawing from me your confidence, which at the same time I assure you is a thing to me very sweet, would influence me as to the judgment that I should pass on the circumstances I might meet in my arduous life?<a name=72:14></a> Alas, my brother, weak indeed as I am -- and I am more and more feeling my weakness, and my entire dependence on grace, and I hope always to feel it, more and more -- for these seventeen years I have had to undergo the consequences, painful and trying to my heart, of the convictions and of the faith that God Himself has wrought in my heart by His word.<a name=72:15></a> I have suffered from it, and greatly; but whilst making sometimes humiliating experience of my weakness, I have had a recompense I could not tell you how abundant, even here below.<a name=72:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have seen the flesh intermingle itself with principles that I find in the word; in the walk of individuals who profess these principles, I have deplored the manifestation of the flesh, but I have not disavowed the principles.<a name=72:17></a> I have also seen poor brothers, who embraced them, act in haste, driven to despair by the behaviour of those who ought to have known things, and who should have been guides.<a name=72:18></a> I am not speaking particularly of verse I have seen these brothers falsify and throw these principles into discord, sometimes, with other truths that I myself cherished greatly; but do you think that the course of the others commended itself to my heart and to my judgment more than that of the poor brothers who perhaps lost their way in some respects in the details?<a name=72:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to Geneva, it has been said to me, Will you judge and condemn those brethren who have separated themselves?<a name=72:20></a> and this has been put to me as a test.<a name=72:21></a> I have replied, that if I judged those who separated themselves, I must judge others also, and I did not pretend to do either the one or the other: that if I were at Geneva I should act according to my conscience, and should endeavour to walk individually in peace.<a name=72:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not altogether ignore what has been done by adversaries of the brethren, who in different places have separated themselves from the dissenting movement.<a name=72:23></a> I desire, nevertheless, to ignore it as far as possible, that my heart may be kept free from the painful influence of these things, and that love may abide: but you must be a very slight observer of the hand and of the ways of God, not to see that there are, although the flesh may mix with it, two principles which are in conflict, and that those who like clericalism, have done all that they could to put into bad odour the principles of those who do not believe this clericalism to be of God.<a name=72:24></a> I have seen the fruits in those who have subjected themselves to this yoke, and in those who have not, and I cannot say that the result has weakened my convictions.<a name=72:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not believe that Dissent is according to the word of God.<a name=72:26></a> The more I have read the word of God, the more the thing has been discussed, the more profoundly I have been convinced of it.<a name=72:27></a> If those who leave it, in pursuance of convictions founded upon the word of God, have not behaved well in the detail of their separation, one ought to warn them of it, as of the work of the flesh.<a name=72:28></a> My conscience does not reproach me with having failed therein, when occasion required it, and christian fidelity.<a name=72:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I cannot say that the conduct of the leaders has inspired me with confidence in their course in preference to that of those who have separated from them.<a name=72:30></a> It is possible that they are beyond the sphere of my brotherly warnings, by their position, higher according to the world; if it is so, I must leave them there, save in praying to God.<a name=72:31></a> It is He who, at the end of the reckoning, will judge both, and then each will have his praise from God.<a name=72:32></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to your ordination ("consecration"), dear brother, I do not attach any importance to it, knowing the persons who did it, and I cannot say that that presents itself in God's sight as a commendation for a special work.<a name=72:33></a> It is a little, it seems to me, throwing oneself on the wrong scent over words.<a name=72:34></a> That all the formalities, dissenting or national, may not have taken place, is very probable.<a name=72:35></a> The truth penetrates, although it may be dishonoured, and although those who have propagated it may be repulsed as innovators.<a name=72:36></a> It is what generally comes to pass.<a name=72:37></a> That some who like to profit by it and glory in it, like also to mix it with the old wine which suits their taste, I understand also.<a name=72:38></a> That only shews me that they are weaker in the faith in this respect, that they have not enough of it to follow with simplicity their convictions, nor the plain path of faith; that is all.<a name=72:39></a> God upholds them for the main thing of their Christianity; I do not believe He approves them in what is equivocal, in the faithlessness of their course.<a name=72:40></a> Ordinarily, it is the first step toward falling back into what one had pruned off by reason of the light being too strong for these things to subsist in it.<a name=72:41></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not believe, dear brother, that your way has been the way of faith.<a name=72:42></a> I do not cease to love you for this.<a name=72:43></a> That others should be glad to have you under their influence is to be understood.<a name=72:44></a> I do not think this way of acting has been of faith, and I think I already see its baneful influence in your letter; you will pardon me for saying so.<a name=72:45></a> That your path may be externally more easy I believe; this it is for me, that in the present state of things is the evil.<a name=72:46></a> That which most separates from the world, and even from the religious world, is that which makes the testimony clearer.<a name=72:47></a> I am not saying that this evil has been your intention, but it is the effect of the way of acting.<a name=72:48></a> Our want of faith associates itself always, according to its measure, with the world, and the place of the religious world of the day is there.<a name=72:49></a> It is thus that I judge the thing, and I do not doubt hat my judgment is right before God .<a name=72:50></a>.<a name=72:51></a>.<a name=72:52></a> .<a name=72:53></a>

		If the brothers at verse have acted in the main by faith, and have mixed much of flesh with it, God will certainly humble them for this last, and will none the less bless them according to their faith.<a name=72:54></a> It is thus, in these trying days, that His grace is forced to act, if I may so say.<a name=72:55></a> For the rest, I shall endeavour to act according to a good conscience before God; the consequences are of little moment to me.<a name=72:56></a> I believe, from what as been told me, that the flesh manifested itself, and that they did things that my judgment disapproves, but I am still judging from their adversaries' account, for, except a single one for a moment, I have not seen them; but I do not think you can be able to judge of it without bias, or that it would be right for me to take your manner of seeing for a rule that I ought to follow.<a name=72:57></a>

		[From the French.<a name=76:1></a>] VERY DEAR SISTER, -- I hear that some of the sisters have had dreams about the coming of Jesus.<a name=76:2></a> This has given me some uneasiness, for although absent in body, I am with you in spirit, desiring and seeking the good of all of you, the dear redeemed ones of our precious Saviour.<a name=76:3></a> It is by the word of God, our rule and our light in these last days, that we must abide.<a name=76:4></a> I do not pretend to say that God may not give warning by a dream, for the word of God says that He can do so; but we must be much upon our guard.<a name=76:5></a> We have no need of a dream with respect to matters clearly revealed by God.<a name=76:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There is danger of the imagination being exalted, of our thinking ourselves something extraordinary, and of the simple word not having its true importance.<a name=76:7></a> Satan is exceedingly busy just now, in disturbing and troubling souls, and in alluring us by his wiles from the place of repose, where it is of all importance that we should be in these days.<a name=76:8></a> The apostle alludes to this in 2 Thessalonians 2, where the enemy sought to divert them from their quiet looking for the Saviour, whose coming had been promised them in the scriptures, and by the testimony of the Spirit, already given.<a name=76:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Satan desired to trouble them by some means, and the apostle shews that signs and wonders are generally found on the enemy's side.<a name=76:10></a> He would have already succeeded for the moment if he could divert them from a scriptural expectation.<a name=76:11></a> "But of the times and the seasons, ye have no need that I write unto you, for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.<a name=76:12></a> For when they shall say, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them .<a name=76:13></a>.<a name=76:14></a>.<a name=76:15></a> .<a name=76:16></a> But ye are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief.<a name=76:17></a>" You are <i>of the day</i>.<a name=76:18></a> That is the position of the Christian.<a name=76:19></a> He is peacefully <i>already</i> of the day.<a name=76:20></a> He needs neither signs, nor wonders, nor dreams.<a name=76:21></a> He has the word.<a name=76:22></a> He ought to possess his soul in patience, humbly keeping his place.<a name=76:23></a> You will generally find that sisters are the ones who have seen these things, and I have not, moreover, noticed that this has drawn them, or others, nearer to God.<a name=76:24></a> God can use sisters, and often honour them greatly in their service, but it is well that this should be in much quietness and modesty of spirit; lest the enemy, who ever seeks, and seeks more than ever now, to trouble and mislead the souls of believers -- lest, I say, he should take occasion from the weakness of the vessel -- weakness which demands honour from us, but which, on the part of the sisters themselves, requires patience and quietness.<a name=76:25></a> So I beg these sisters to weigh these things well, and not to allow themselves readily to put faith in these dreams, as if they came from God.<a name=76:26></a> Let them not allow themselves to be carried away by their imagination, lest they should fall into the snare of the enemy, and lest he should take advantage of this to shake the faith of some.<a name=76:27></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We are in times when the enemy tries to surprise us; the word is the great thing for us, and our strength.<a name=76:28></a> "Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation.<a name=76:29></a> Thou hast a little strength .<a name=76:30></a>.<a name=76:31></a>.<a name=76:32></a> .<a name=76:33></a> hold that fast which thou hast .<a name=76:34></a>.<a name=76:35></a>.<a name=76:36></a> I come quickly;" this is the direction for our days.<a name=76:37></a> May God keep you all, beloved, in His holy keeping.<a name=76:38></a> Walk humbly, close to Him, and He will not fail you.<a name=76:39></a> My heart is with you; my prayers rise to God for you; and if times are difficult, they are times which keep the children of God more occupied than ever.<a name=76:40></a> If we walk as those who have but a little strength, He will set before us an open door, which no man shall shut.<a name=76:41></a> Let us be content with small things, and we shall have all the blessing of the Lord.<a name=76:42></a> And do you, dear sister, keep near the Lord, and walk humbly and quietly, with thanksgiving, leaning upon Him.<a name=76:43></a> The times are evil, but the Lord is faithful.<a name=76:44></a> Rejoice in Him.<a name=76:45></a>

		[From the French.<a name=78:1></a>] -- - I have lately read Numbers and the Epistle to the Philippians with edification.<a name=78:2></a> The setting up of the rod of Aaron, priest in grace, while in authority still, after all the murmurings of the congregation; its use, although this was by Moses; the want of its use on the occasion of fresh complaints of the congregation; all this has singularly instructed me.<a name=78:3></a> At the same time, when God has judged and disciplined the people, the way in which He immediately speaks (chapter 15) of all His promises and of the land being theirs, as having been given them by Him, touched me very much.<a name=78:4></a> His promise and His thoughts for His people are as firm as if nothing had happened.<a name=78:5></a> The responsibility, and the food of the priests, as such, and of their families, as families, and the points of difference, I also found very instructive.<a name=78:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What struck me in the Epistle to the Philippians, is the way in which the apostle has his death continually before his eyes; then that the trials he had endured had acted as a wholesome discipline, causing Christ to be everything for him, and himself to be nothing.<a name=78:7></a> And what peace that gives!<a name=78:8></a> He knows not if he is to be condemned.<a name=78:9></a> <i>For himself</i>, the decision of the magistrates does not enter into his thoughts; for himself, he knows not what to choose; but for the church it is good that he should remain: it is decided then.<a name=78:10></a> He judges his case by the sole consideration that such a decision will be for the good of the church, and thus Christ will have it decided.<a name=78:11></a> Is it thus that we trust in Him, dear brother?<a name=78:12></a> Alas!<a name=78:13></a> no; at least too often we are not enough <i>divested of ourselves</i>; we cannot say with the apostle, "<i>I have learned</i>.<a name=78:14></a>" This is what we need to learn.<a name=78:15></a> Well, it is the life of this man, so faithful, so devoted, and so gifted by God, the life of the Apostle Paul, instructed and disciplined in this manner, and the perfect calm which he enjoys as the result of this discipline, which has lately edified me in reading this epistle.<a name=78:16></a>

		Dearest G V Wigram, -- I thank you much for your note.<a name=79:1></a> My mind did pass through the same process of anxiety as that of which you speak, as far as anxiety went; a qualm crossing my mind that some work of the enemy, more thorough than I knew how to judge of, was at the bottom.<a name=79:2></a> But I found the ground of acting on scripture my resource, and that I had nothing to do with any feeling.<a name=79:3></a> I had but to bring them all before God.<a name=79:4></a> The result has been, the avowal by N.<a name=79:5></a> in the presence of the brethren, of much more than any one charged him with, though I did not doubt it was so -- of what no one would adopt, or at least avow with him, and has made those who were not partisans declare their thankfulness that I came down, and that it was fairly brought out.<a name=79:6></a> I trust he will yet disavow it, and that all will be peace.<a name=79:7></a> At any rate, I believe decided good has been done.<a name=79:8></a> My conscience is as clear as the day, as to having avoided the smallest act approaching to hostile or party feeling -- quite the contrary.<a name=79:9></a> I admit, that in manner I might have been more calm, though quite so in conduct, indeed, I have been not only calm, but as happy as possible, and at large in ministering, for God has been very graciously with me, though it was all very painful.<a name=79:10></a> But when I had done what I had to do, my soul had no more to say to it than if there were nothing.<a name=79:11></a> We are not yet out of the wood, as I hope we may be, because Newton has not yet disavowed the purpose he avowed, but I trust it may come to this, and our relations be unhindered as before.<a name=79:12></a> As to me, I have no complaint, he had done nothing against me.<a name=79:13></a> Certain women of our company are, I believe, very angry; but I come across nothing, but go on my way, tranquilly seeking to minister as much blessing to all as I can.<a name=79:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The meetings on Wednesday evenings, when I have lectured, are at least doubled, and that gradually, so I hope there is blessing.<a name=79:15></a> I do not hesitate to say it was all over with the brethren's meeting in unity, if that had gone on which was going on.<a name=79:16></a> I hope the common ground may yet be spared to us, but as I said, we are not out of the wood, and I do not holloa yet, but I trust the Lord, and am quite happy in confiding in Him.<a name=79:17></a> He has indeed already done more than I could ever have expected, and why should I distrust Him?<a name=79:18></a> Peace be with you all.<a name=79:19></a> I do believe that real blessing will result, though I do not say that the neck of party spirit is entirely broken, nor grace reigning in all hearts, but I hope for it, for who can measure the love of Christ to His body?<a name=79:20></a> St.<a name=79:21></a> Paul judged his own trial and pronounced his own acquittal unhesitatingly, the moment he sees it was for the good of the church.<a name=79:22></a>

		I now proceed to tell you why I did so.<a name=84:5></a> I felt that God was practically displaced, and so I told them, and then stated the three following points: the subverting the principles on which we meet -- this, I think I may say, is not denied now by any (unless the doers of it on principle); at least, it is admitted that brethren (teachers) were intentionally kept away, and Soltau urges Mr.<a name=84:6></a> Harris to stay and resume his place, in order to help him to resist.<a name=84:7></a> Some say that they were only tendencies, and not a purpose, but the fact is not denied.<a name=84:8></a> I cannot here enter into all the facts, but I am perfectly convinced there were purpose, doctrine, and fact; and you have no idea of the extent to which it had gone.<a name=84:9></a> It was, to my mind, as bad as bad could be in other aspects.<a name=84:10></a> Secondly, there was actual evil and unrighteousness unconfessed and unjudged: this Harris does not enter upon.<a name=84:11></a> And that thirdly, a meeting which has worked in the guidance of the details of the body and service of the saints, has been not only set aside, but refused to be reinstated.<a name=84:12></a> This last was what finally decided Harris before his return here to decline further ministry.<a name=84:13></a> I had proposed publicly, as he had laboured in private (and I had also spoken of it) at the re-establishment of this meeting; and the rejection of it occasioned a stay of all moral discipline, unless on the summary judgment of two or three who took it on themselves.<a name=84:14></a> This deprived of remedy, for the existence of evil would not in itself be a reason for leaving, but evil unjudged and really sanctioned would, when it could not be remedied.<a name=84:15></a> I have only to add, that I have felt the unclouded approbation of God since I have done it.<a name=84:16></a> I had not before an idea of the mass of evil, and how many knew it.<a name=84:17></a> Yet I believe the great body wholly ignorant of it, and so I stated when I announced my withdrawal.<a name=84:18></a> But they almost all felt that there was something which had destroyed spirituality and love.<a name=84:19></a> In my judgment it was very bad indeed.<a name=84:20></a> I waited eight or nine months before I did this, and till every step was taken to remedy the evil; and I should have felt the Lord against me had I waited longer.<a name=84:21></a> I believe it has done very much good; the conscience of a vast number has been awakened, evil acknowledged by some who were immersed in it fast, I believe, with evil intention, and I hope more blessing may thus come from above.<a name=84:22></a> When I say it, I believe the withdrawal of Harris from ministering had as much, and perhaps more effect, than my withdrawal from communion, from his having been much more here latterly, and the only one who visited, and whom the poor really knew and loved.<a name=84:23></a> All the poor, I think I may say, have felt the evil.<a name=84:24></a> I told them that I did it with unmingled grief and sorrow, and only wished it might be remedied, that I loved all and valued many very much, that I believed the great body quite innocent of it, but that there was one Table and one bread, and they were all responsible, and that my feeling was that -- as evil was not remedied -- I could not identify myself with evil that I knew.<a name=84:25></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It seemed to me you acted quite wisely, having no information as to the sister coming here.<a name=84:26></a> I trust the Lord may restore you all, and it is all I desire for this gathering too.<a name=84:27></a> I thank you dear brother, very much for your prayers, and feel that I need them, as I trust you may be enabled to continue them.<a name=84:28></a> It has been, I need not say, a time of great trial to me.<a name=84:29></a> Still, I have felt the Lord with me, and have been with Him, however feeble; and I am quite in peace since I left the gathering.<a name=84:30></a> Already many have separated between good and evil, and graciously; up to this, people had gone away, or held their tongues hopeless.<a name=84:31></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have no desire but that all should be restored in peace here, and it would be much greater joy to return than even to have cleared my conscience in leaving; I wait upon the Lord, and in the enjoyment of the light of His countenance about it.<a name=84:34></a> I have avoided everything which would have the appearance of party or lead to it.<a name=84:35></a> I do not believe even that the enemy has ventured to charge me with it.<a name=84:36></a> I have no feeling of the kind -- God forbid I should.<a name=84:37></a> You are not aware that many brethren elsewhere feel as strongly, or more so than I do about it.<a name=84:38></a> I do not pretend to say they would therefore necessarily [have] taken the same method, but of that I have no regret.<a name=84:39></a> I may just add, that I have refrained from breaking bread apart, though many have stayed away, hoping they may come through grace to set all right.<a name=84:40></a>

		I write rather because of the importance of the point than for any immediate occasion of circumstances: I mean leaving an assembly, or setting up, as it is called, another table.<a name=86:1></a> I am not so afraid of it as some other brethren, but I must explain my reasons.<a name=86:2></a> If such or such a meeting were the church here, leaving it would be severing oneself from the assembly of God.<a name=86:3></a> But, though wherever two or three are gathered together in Christ's name He is in the midst, and the blessing and responsibility of the church is in a certain sense also, if any Christians now set up to be the church, or did any formal act which pretended to it, I should leave them, as being a false pretension, and denying the very testimony to the state of ruin which God has called us to render.<a name=86:4></a> It would have ceased to be the table of the people and testimony of God, at least intelligently.<a name=86:5></a> It might be evil pretension or ignorance; it might call for patience if it was in ignorance, or for remedy, if that was possible: but such a pretension I believe false, and I could not abide in what is false.<a name=86:6></a> I think it of the last importance that this pretension of any body should be kept down: I could not own it a moment, because it is not the truth.<a name=86:7></a>

		But, then, on the other hand, united testimony to the truth is the greatest possible blessing from on high.<a name=86:8></a> And I think that if any one, through the flesh, separated from two or three walking godlily before God in the unity of the whole body of Christ, it would not merely be an act of schism, but he would necessarily deprive himself of the blessing of God's presence.<a name=86:9></a> It resolves itself, like all else, into a question of flesh and Spirit.<a name=86:10></a> If the Spirit of God is in and sanctions the body, he who leaves in the flesh deprives himself of the blessing, and sins.<a name=86:11></a> If, on the contrary, the Spirit of God does not sanction the body, he who leaves it will get into the power and liberty of the Spirit by following Him.<a name=86:12></a> That is the real way to look at it.<a name=86:13></a> There may be evil, and yet the Spirit of God sanction the body (not of course, its then state), or at least act with the body in putting it away.<a name=86:14></a> But if the Spirit of God, by any faithful person, moves in this, and the evil is not put away, but persisted in; is the Spirit of God with those who continue in the evil, or with him who will not?<a name=86:15></a> Or is the doctrine of the unity of the body to be made a cover for evil?<a name=86:16></a> That is precisely the delusion of Satan in Popery, and the worst form of evil under the sun.<a name=86:17></a> If the matter, instead of being brought to the conscience of the body is maintained by the authority of a few, and the body of believers despised, it is the additional concomitant evil of the clergy, which is the element also of Popery.<a name=86:18></a> Now, I believe myself, the elements of this have been distinctly brought out at Plymouth; and I cannot stay in evil to preserve unity.<a name=86:19></a> I do not want unity in evil, but separation from it.<a name=86:20></a> God's unity is always founded on separation, since sin came into the world.<a name=86:21></a> "Get thee out," is the first word of God's call: it is to Himself.<a name=86:22></a> If one get out alone, it may require more faith, but that is all; one will be with Him, and that, dear brother, is what I care most about, though overjoyed to be with my brethren on that ground.<a name=86:23></a> I do not say that some more spiritual person might not have done more or better than I: God must judge of that.<a name=86:24></a> I am sure I am sure I am a poor creature; but at all cost I must walk with God for myself .<a name=86:25></a>.<a name=86:26></a>.<a name=86:27></a> .<a name=86:28></a>

		[W Kelly] DEAREST BROTHER, -- I take up my pen at last to answer your letter.<a name=88:1></a> As to the facts connecting themselves with scripture I had no difficulty as to myself, the difficulty was as to demonstration to others.<a name=88:2></a> In the first place, Mr.<a name=88:3></a> Newton's statement in April was to have union in testimony here, against the teaching of the other brethren, and that he trusted to have at least Devon and Somerset under his influence for the purpose.<a name=88:4></a> And this was done most assiduously and perseveringly, so that at last in some places, they had to tell Mr.<a name=88:5></a> N.<a name=88:6></a> they would bear it no longer; but the saints here had no present proof of this.<a name=88:7></a> No person who moved in the sphere of the teachers but knew that they were by calumnies, reproaches, and letters, keeping away other brethren.<a name=88:8></a> Nor do those that are honest now deny it.<a name=88:9></a> But the body of the brethren here had not seen these letters, and in the (what I must call) audacious state of conscience the leaders were in, I should have been challenged to produce them.<a name=88:10></a> Here their case broke down in April, because McA.<a name=88:11></a> had seen them and put them to silence.<a name=88:12></a> Each Sunday was as regularly N.<a name=88:13></a> and H.<a name=88:14></a> as in the establishment, and everybody knew it: there was no arrangement written -- nothing to be proved.<a name=88:15></a> A poor man gave out a hymn, no one would raise it: whose fault was that?<a name=88:16></a> At length the facts were not denied, but they were said to be accidents; though N.<a name=88:17></a> had told me at the Bristol meeting that his principles were changed, and B.<a name=88:18></a> had been reasoning with me on the ground of it, and declaring the brethren elsewhere who sought to serve the saints cyphers, and five cyphers never could make one unless they were regularly recognised.<a name=88:19></a> The persons in authority had been named by Mr.<a name=88:20></a> N.<a name=88:21></a> here as those he recognised and none else.<a name=88:22></a> The Friday meeting had been broken up, and Mr.<a name=88:23></a> S.<a name=88:24></a>, owning there ought to be one, said he could not move in it because Mr.<a name=88:25></a> N.<a name=88:26></a> would have only those he chose, and it would produce a rupture with him.<a name=88:27></a> It had been openly taught by N.<a name=88:28></a> and B.<a name=88:29></a> that the Lord did not now use poor uneducated men, as those He chose before His resurrection, but after that, such as Paul, Luther and Calvin, Wesley and Whitfield, and myself now.<a name=88:30></a> It came to such a point, preventing people speaking in the room, that S.<a name=88:31></a> called it jockeyship; now I confess to you in what professes to be a meeting where the blessed God is, I do not like going on with jockeyship.<a name=88:32></a> But what could be proved here?<a name=88:33></a> Some one got up too quick, that was all -- and perhaps did it in a case where the majority would go with him as to the effect, keeping down some speaker they did not like; and in the particular case the sisters had already tried to silence him by making a noise with their feet.<a name=88:34></a> The Holy Ghost was totally disowned, the body of the poor miserable, and utterly despised and rejected.<a name=88:35></a> But I did not leave for all this.<a name=88:36></a> It was when all remedy for this was rejected with scorn, that I then said I could not stay.<a name=88:37></a> Every attempt by -- , -- , etc.<a name=88:38></a>, and others to investigate the evil before the brethren has been rejected.<a name=88:39></a> You may well suppose the difficulty of dealing with facts before the body, that it was constantly denied in toto, in the face of a settled arrangement (not in words but in fact) to speak alternate Sundays, that anybody was hindered -- and at least three cases of prevention by the authority of Mr.<a name=88:40></a> N.<a name=88:41></a> and those he employed.<a name=88:42></a> And as to those without, when S.<a name=88:43></a> pressed their having kept away Bellett, and that he felt they had sinned, Mr.<a name=88:44></a> N.<a name=88:45></a> said -- on his asking could he acquiesce in his coming now -- he thought he could, because all were sufficiently made up now to resist his teaching.<a name=88:46></a> But on the avowed principle of clericalism it was peremptorily refused to let the brethren judge anything about the matter.<a name=88:47></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If scripture warrants me to separate from the worst evil as to corporate action I ever met, then I am sanctioned in separating from this.<a name=88:48></a> If the unity of the church is to be the sanction of evil, we are landed in Rome at once.<a name=88:49></a> It was taught (not here) that in reference to the noble Bereans, that was Jews searching the Jewish scriptures, and that now God had raised up gifts and teaching, it was quite otherwise.<a name=88:50></a> Besides, there are things that sicken one, which you cannot say much about.<a name=88:51></a> I never, in all my experience in and out of the church, really met so little truth and straightforwardness; and nothing could be proved which had been said and done twenty times over, unless you had witnesses by, and then others were ready to say it was something else.<a name=88:52></a> I would not have stayed in it, my dear -- , if I were to walk alone and have no church at all to the end of my days.<a name=88:53></a> But God has ordered it otherwise, and given exceeding peace and quietness to those who have through grace delivered their souls from it.<a name=88:54></a> I have no doubt a direct power and delusion of the enemy was there, from which we have been rescued by the Lord's goodness, and are in the blessing and liberty of the Spirit of God, though poor and feeble.<a name=88:55></a> The visit of the brethren has, I think, to any heedful mind, left no doubt as to the standing of Ebrington Street.<a name=88:56></a> Romans 16: 17, is just what I acted upon, on coming to Plymouth.<a name=88:57></a> The denouncing of godly brethren as subverting the gospel, by letters sent to India, Canada, Ireland, and everywhere, and hindering any teachers not ready to receive N.<a name=88:58></a>'s views coming here as far as they could, and making a focus of Plymouth, was causing divisions.<a name=88:59></a> And it was just -- though I shrank from using such a hard word -- 3 John 9, 10 that was precisely going on at Plymouth.<a name=88:60></a> No calumny was too bad to cast on the most godly brethren, to discredit them and hinder their coming here.<a name=88:61></a> I dare say if I had apostolic power I might have acted more efficiently, but I have not a regret or a cloud on my mind as to my path being where I was, save that I might have left in April.<a name=88:62></a> The Lord never roused the conscience of the body till I left.<a name=88:63></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I close: I am most sorry to rake up what this letter does (as I have only mentioned things just as they occurred to me to satisfy your mind) without trying to make out all: for many to me most material things I have not mentioned as to facts and evil -- but sorry, because the truth is we, who are come out, have our minds with the happy testimony of the Holy Ghost, completely clear of all this, do not ever think of it, and have no need to think of it any more.<a name=88:64></a> This has been one of the happy features, the subdued, happy, gracious spirit of those who have left; we are in another world as to our minds.<a name=88:65></a>

		[From the French.<a name=91:1></a>] MY VERY DEAR SISTERS, -- I have been much touched by your kindness in reminding me of your christian affection.<a name=91:2></a> It seems to me, in fact, incredible that four months have rolled away since I wrote to Lausanne.<a name=91:3></a> It is true that I have not replied to M.<a name=91:4></a> G.<a name=91:5></a> since the month of November, that is to say, I have a letter from him of that date, to which I have not replied.<a name=91:6></a> But the time passes so quickly that I do not doubt it, for in fact I have been very desirous myself for news of you, though there has been such a considerable lapse of time.<a name=91:7></a> However, I have a confidence in God that keeps me in peace, even when long silence gives me the desire to have news of the brethren.<a name=91:8></a> As for my health, to dispose of it as quickly as possible, the Lord gives me the strength that seems good to Him; more than that would not he well.<a name=91:9></a> The troubles of this year have worn me a little; moreover, one is worn year by year if it pleases God, though His longsuffering is still salvation; may the time roll on, still more quickly -- my desires are fixed on the land of rest, this precious rest of God.<a name=91:10></a> My heart opens yet more to the thought of the glory, and of the rest that Christ is preparing for us, and I sigh for the moment, and with all my heart; my heart and my joy are there.<a name=91:11></a> The circumstances I have had to pass through, I believe have made my soul more ripe, at least, I hope so, for the joys that are with Christ, have bound me more and more sensibly to Him, and to all that has to do with Him -- that is found in Him.<a name=91:12></a> All this (though I am very feeble) is better known to me, more felt.<a name=91:13></a> I am more cut off, more for Him; it is not that I am deceived as if the flesh and the conflict were no longer for me.<a name=91:14></a> I know well it is not so.<a name=91:15></a> But my life is more hidden with Christ in God.<a name=91:16></a> As to my spirit, my abode is more there, and it is worth while, dear friends.<a name=91:17></a> However, I am a poor, miserable, sorry creature.<a name=91:18></a> I know it well.<a name=91:19></a> But in the measure in which I accompany soul after soul to the gate of heaven, I begin to think that it is almost time I should go in there.<a name=91:20></a> I wait.<a name=91:21></a> I belong to Him, who has truly the right to dispose of me and of all these things.<a name=91:22></a> Till then I work as a hireling that accomplishes his day, and alas, I am but a very bad workman, not worthy to be called such -- still, happy to be one.<a name=91:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		You must not think, dear sisters, that the circumstances have discouraged or depressed me before God.<a name=91:24></a> They have been painful, but not more so than I expected when I left Lausanne, in many respects less.<a name=91:25></a> I believe that more faith, less regard for the feelings of the brethren, would have greatly shortened my work.<a name=91:26></a> But I trust that He who searches the hearts will find there at least the intention of charity.<a name=91:27></a> I warned them of it when I was here three years ago.<a name=91:28></a> But God does His work, and I never more felt His faithfulness, and His great goodness.<a name=91:29></a> Never has my faith been more encouraged.<a name=91:30></a> Never have I felt more sensibly that God was acting, and that I could count on Him.<a name=91:31></a> In looking back, I am struck with all His grace.<a name=91:32></a> The sifting is severe, but it is a sifting of love.<a name=91:33></a> Since I acted decidedly, my peace and my joy are very great, as well as of all those who have done the same.<a name=91:34></a> Consciences have need, as well as the heart of the spiritual man has need, to be awakened; and that has been done.<a name=91:35></a> Never have I enjoyed so much communion in worship, and of the presence of God.<a name=91:36></a> Oh, how true it is that our Rock is faithful, and that He is near to us, to those who call upon Him with faith.<a name=91:37></a>

		BELOVED BROTHER, -- I was glad to get something from you, and glad to get this letter.<a name=93:1></a> In reply to it I can only say, without answering for every expression in it, after running it over, instead of quarrelling with it as an objection, as to the general bearing and object of it, I believe that it is having departed from what has suggested itself to your mind which has been the weakness of the brethren.<a name=93:2></a> I believe that churches have been merged in the [mass<a href="#93:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>] of ecclesiastical popular hierarchism and lost; but I believe that the visible church, as you call it, has been merged there too.<a name=93:3></a> Still there is a difference, because churches were the administrative form, while the church as a body on earth was the vital unity.<a name=93:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I felt from the beginning, and began with, was this: the Holy Ghost remains, and therefore, the essential principle of unity with His presence for (the fact we are now concerned in) wherever two or three are gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of them.<a name=93:5></a> When this is really sought, there will certainly be blessing by His presence.<a name=93:6></a> We have found it so, most sweetly and graciously, who have met separately here.<a name=93:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When there is an attempt at displaying the position and the unity, there will always be a mess and a failure.<a name=93:8></a> God will not take such a place with us.<a name=93:9></a> We must get into the place of His mind to get His strength; that is now, the failure of the church.<a name=93:10></a> But there He will be with us.<a name=93:11></a> I have always said this; I know it has troubled some, even those I specially love; but I am sure it is the Lord's mind.<a name=93:12></a> I have said we are the witnesses of the weakness and low state of the church.<a name=93:13></a> We are not stronger nor better than the others, dissenters, etc.<a name=93:14></a>; but we only own our bad and lost state, and therefore can find blessing.<a name=93:15></a> I do not limit what the blessed Spirit can do for us in this low estate, but I take the place where He can do it.<a name=93:16></a> Hence, government of bodies in an authorised way, I believe there is none; where this is assumed, there will be confusion.<a name=93:17></a> It was here; and it was constantly and openly said that this was to be a model, so that all in distant places might refer to it.<a name=93:18></a> My thorough conviction is that conscience was utterly gone, save in those who were utterly miserable.<a name=93:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I only therefore so far seek the original standing of the church, as to believe that wherever two or three are gathered in His name, Christ will be; and that the Spirit of God is necessarily the only source of power, and that what He does will be blessing through the Lordship of Christ.<a name=93:20></a> These provide for all times.<a name=93:21></a> If more be attempted now, it will be confusion only.<a name=93:22></a> The original condition is owned as a sinner, or mutilated man, owns integrity of conscience or a whole body.<a name=93:23></a> But there a most important point comes in: I cannot supply the lack by human arrangement or wisdom: I must be dependent.<a name=93:24></a> I should disown whatever was not of the Spirit, and in this sense disown whatever was -- not short of the original standing, for that in the complete sense I am, but -- what man has done to fill it up; because this does not own the coming short, nor the Spirit of God.<a name=93:25></a> I would always own what is of God's Spirit in any.<a name=93:26></a> The rule seems to me here very simple.<a name=93:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not doubt that dispensed power is disorganised; but the Holy Ghost is always competent to act in the circumstances God's people are in.<a name=93:28></a> The secret is, not to pretend to get beyond it.<a name=93:29></a> Life, and divine power, is always there; and I use the members I have, with full confession that I am in an imperfect state.<a name=93:30></a> We must remember that the body must exist, though not in a united state; and so even locally.<a name=93:31></a> I can then, therefore, own their gifts and the like, and get my warrant in two or three united for blessing promised to that.<a name=93:32></a> Then if gifts exist, they cannot be exercised but as members of the body; because they are such, not by outward union, but by the vital power of the Head through the Holy Ghost.<a name=93:33></a> "Visible body," I suspect, misleads us a little.<a name=93:34></a> Clearly the corporate operation is in the actual living body down here on earth; but there it is the members must act, so that I do not think it makes a difficulty.<a name=93:35></a> I believe, if we were to act on 1 Corinthians 12, 14, farther than power exists to verify it, we should make a mess.<a name=93:36></a> But then the existence of the body, whatever its scattered condition, necessarily continues, because it depends on the existence of the Head, and its union with it.<a name=93:37></a> In this the Holy Ghost is necessarily supreme.<a name=93:38></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The body exists in virtue of there being one Holy Ghost.<a name=93:39></a> There is one body, and one Spirit, even as we are called in one hope of our calling.<a name=93:40></a> Indeed this is the very point which is denied here.<a name=93:41></a> Then Christ necessarily nourishes and cherishes us as His own flesh, as members of His body; and this goes on "till we all come," etc.<a name=93:42></a> (Ephesians 4) Hence I apprehend we cannot deny the body and its unity, whatever its unfaithfulness and condition, and (so far as the Holy Ghost is owned) His operation in it, without denying the divine title of the Holy Ghost, and the care and headship of Christ over the church.<a name=93:43></a> Here I get, not a question of the church's conduct, but of Christ's, and the truth of the Holy Ghost being on earth, and His title when there, and yet owning of Christ's Lordship.<a name=93:44></a> And this is how far I own others.<a name=93:45></a> If a minister has gifts in the Establishment, I own it as through the Spirit, Christ begetting the members of His body, or nourishing it.<a name=93:46></a> But I cannot go along with what it is mixed up with, because it is not of the body, nor of the Spirit.<a name=93:47></a> I cannot touch the unclean, I am to separate the precious from the vile.<a name=93:48></a> But I cannot give up Ephesians 4 while I own the faithfulness of Christ.<a name=93:49></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now if we meet, yea, and when we do not meet, all I look for is that this principle should be owned, because it is owning the Holy Ghost Himself, and that to me is everything.<a name=93:50></a> We meet and worship; and at this time we who have separated meet in different rooms, that we may in the truest and simplest way, in our weakness, worship.<a name=93:51></a> Then whatever the Holy Ghost may give to any one, He is supreme to feed us with -- perhaps nothing in the way of speaking; and it must be in the unity of the body.<a name=93:52></a> If you were here, you could be in the unity of the body, as one of ourselves.<a name=93:53></a> This Satan cannot destroy, because it is connected with Christ's title and power.<a name=93:54></a> If men set up to imitate the administration of the body, it will be popery or dissent at once.<a name=93:55></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And this is what I see of the visibility of the body: it connects itself with this infinitely important principle, the presence and action of the Holy Ghost on earth.<a name=93:56></a> It is not merely a saved thing in the counsels of God, but a living thing animated down here by its union with the Head, and the presence of the Holy Ghost in it.<a name=93:57></a> It is a real actual thing the Holy Ghost acting down here.<a name=93:58></a> If two are faithful in this, they will be blessed in it.<a name=93:59></a> If they said; "We are the body," not owning all the members, in whatever condition, they would morally cease to be of it.<a name=93:60></a> I own them, but in nothing their condition.<a name=93:61></a> The principle is all-important.<a name=93:62></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ has attached therefore its practical operation to two or three, and owns them by His presence.<a name=93:63></a> He has provided for its maintenance.<a name=93:64></a> Thus in all states of ruin it cannot cease, till He cease to be the Head, and the Holy Spirit to be as the guide and the comforter sent down.<a name=93:65></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God sanctioned the setting up of Saul; He never did, the departure from the Holy Ghost.<a name=93:66></a> The "two or three" take definitely the place of the temple, which was the locality of God's presence, as a principle of union.<a name=93:67></a> That is what makes all the difference.<a name=93:68></a> Hence, in the division of Israel, the righteous sought the temple as a point of unity, and David is to us here Christ by the Holy Ghost.<a name=93:69></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On the other hand church government, save as the Spirit is always power, cannot be acted on.<a name=93:70></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let me hear from you, for this is of all importance at the present moment.<a name=93:71></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ever, beloved brother, very affectionately.<a name=93:72></a>

		[Mr Chlow] DEAR BROTHER, -- I thank you for your kind attention in sending me the paper.<a name=97:1></a> The form of it would induce me to decline any attention to it -- an anonymous circular on such a subject seems to me an anomaly, and of very evil example in the church of God.<a name=97:2></a> But I feel bound further to say, that I feel obliged to decline any participation in it (I speak individually, I dare say many may join in it with a true heart) whatever.<a name=97:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You must be fully aware that the things you would confess, and others with whom you think it right to associate, would be entirely contrary to what I could judge right before God; the things that I may judge evil and the root of all this, you probably (indeed, there can be little doubt) would not confess at all; nor can I think there is in the actual state of things, any confession of what I judge to be evil before God, but quite the contrary.<a name=97:4></a> Thence I judge that to pretend to join in any common confession -- and you must think the same -- would be hypocrisy, and really awfully mocking God.<a name=97:5></a> I decline it therefore altogether; indeed, I think the whole thing an evil, though I am in full charity towards you, and I do not doubt many in many places will join in it sincerely, and be blessed.<a name=97:6></a> I have felt it more honest, and indeed bound to say to you openly what the Lord I believe leads me to by His grace.<a name=97:7></a> The plainer the better, I think, in the present state of things; but I remain

		[Mr Meylan][From the French] VERY DEAR BROTHER, -- I was much pleased, I need not tell you, to receive your letter.<a name=97:10></a> I understand well that work prevents one from writing, and that those who labour much do not so much like writing either, but this only makes communications all the more pleasant when one does receive them.<a name=97:11></a> Blessed be God that you have been able to give good news; and always, when one can do so of one's work and of His grace, to say in fact that God is working recalls us to Him, and that is what always gives us joy.<a name=97:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Indeed the work has been remarkable at -- , but God has been better than our thoughts; this is not surprising, but we ought at least to bless Him for it with all our hearts.<a name=97:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now as to the questions of doctrine.<a name=97:14></a> If Christ is in our hearts and in our words, God uses, dear brother, very imperfect expressions to communicate blessing to souls; and He even uses erroneous expressions; nevertheless, they bring with them into the soul something imperfect or erroneous; also those who observe it are stumbled by it.<a name=97:15></a> I can say to an <i>exercised</i> soul that his salvation is finished, because I am only directing him, outside himself and the judgment which he exercises on an internal work of which he is incapable of judging, to Christ, whose perfect work is the simple object of faith.<a name=97:16></a> I could not say it to every one; this would be to interfere with the election of God, of which I know nothing: but I can say to all, that propitiation has been presented to God.<a name=97:17></a> They have but to look there, and going to God by that blood they will be received; they have nothing to wait for.<a name=97:18></a> They will not go unless the Father draw them, but this is a matter of sovereign grace, with which I have nothing to do in my preaching -- in my teaching, yes, but not in my address to unconverted souls.<a name=97:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the blood which is put upon the mercy-seat, it is not a question of those who are saved or of election, but of the majesty of God, which demands this satisfaction for sin.<a name=97:20></a> I can address all, and declare to them that this satisfaction has been made, and that God the Father has perfectly accepted it.<a name=97:21></a> But I cannot say to all that Christ bore their sins, because the word does not say it anywhere.<a name=97:22></a> If He had borne their sins, they would certainly be justified, and consequently saved by the life of Christ, and glorified.<a name=97:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus in Romans 5: 18, the gift has come "towards" -- not "upon" -- literally it reads, "So then as by one offence, towards all men to condemnation" (it is the direction <i>towards</i> which a thing would go if left to itself, not its <i>coming upon</i>), "so by one righteousness towards all men for justification of life.<a name=97:24></a>" This is why he says "<i>all</i>.<a name=97:25></a>" But in verse 19, "For as indeed by the disobedience of the one man the many have been constituted sinners; so also by the obedience of the one the many will be constituted righteous;" here it is the effect, not the tendency, therefore he says "many.<a name=97:26></a>" The thing is not limited to the one who accomplished it, but extends in its efficacy to those who are interested in it; the many are constituted sinners or righteous in virtue of these two works.<a name=97:27></a> So it is said, Romans 3: 22, "[The] righteousness of God by faith of Jesus Christ <i>towards</i> all, and upon all those who believe.<a name=97:28></a>" It is one thing to put the blood on the mercy-seat, this was God's lot; another to confess the sins of the people on the head of the goat Azazel.<a name=97:29></a> On account of the one, God can act in the testimony of love towards all, His righteousness being satisfied; on account of the other, He owes it to Christ never to find those sins again: they have been borne into a land not inhabited.<a name=97:30></a> Now this is not true of the sins of the wicked: therefore it cannot be said that it is not on account of the fruits of Adam's sin that men are condemned, for it is said, "<i>For which things' sake</i> the wrath of God cometh upon the children of disobedience.<a name=97:31></a>" And "If ye believe not that I am he ye shall die in your sins.<a name=97:32></a>" Thus I quite believe that Christ died for all, but I cannot say that He bore, as a substitute, the sins of all.<a name=97:33></a> The word, it seems to me, is very clear on this point in its doctrines, in the consequences that it draws from them, and in its types.<a name=97:34></a> So that I take <i>ajntivlutron uJpe;r pavntwn</i> in the simplest and widest sense.<a name=97:35></a> Satisfaction has been presented to God for men, but here (1 Timothy 2: 6) it is evident these words refer to the desire to make of Jesus, at least of the Messiah, a mediator of the Jewish nation.<a name=97:36></a> No, says the apostle, He is so for all.<a name=97:37></a> God <i>qevlei</i> (not <i>bouvletai</i>) that all, not the Jews only, should be saved; He has given, therefore, one Mediator for all, who has made the propitiation which was necessary, and demanded by the majesty of God, so that the door is open to all through the satisfaction that He has made to the outraged majesty of God.<a name=97:38></a> But God has predestinated His own: He calls them; He quickens them.<a name=97:39></a> For if the matter rested there (that is to say, at an open door) no one, not even the elect, would come.<a name=97:40></a> But Christ has confessed the sins of those thus brought as if they were His own.<a name=97:41></a> He "shall justify many, for he shall bear their iniquities.<a name=97:42></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Farewell, beloved brother.<a name=97:43></a> May our good and faithful Lord and Saviour sustain you and us, and guide us; we need it; and blessed be His name for it, He has it at heart to do it.<a name=97:44></a> Yes, we may pass through strait and difficult places, but He is not the less faithful; only let us look to Him, and He is there, even when He seems to forsake us, in order to put faith to the proof, and to make us known to ourselves.<a name=97:45></a> However, we have usually exposed ourselves to the enemy before things come to this pass, then He makes us feel within what we have failed in as to watchfulness without.<a name=97:46></a> If the enemy is outside, it is not a question of our strength, but of that of the door which keeps him out; if we have opened it, our own is in question.<a name=97:47></a> This makes us feel what we are, and also where we have failed in watchfulness and prayer, but He is faithful.<a name=97:48></a> Greet all the brethren warmly.<a name=97:49></a> I have been very happy during my illness: it has made me feel much more than ever that heaven and the bosom of God is my rest, my home, seeing that I shall be with Him for ever.<a name=97:50></a>

		Dearest W Kelly, -- First as to transubstantiation.<a name=100:1></a> I have generally found that in sincere Roman Catholics where there was a value for Christ, though in some respects natural, this remained the thought in their mind; it connects itself with a sensible apprehension of Him like a picture, and seems to be borne out by scripture -- respects it though it do not rightly divide or understand it.<a name=100:2></a> Yet the scriptural reasons seem to me most strong and plain on the point, yet a person may be a true saint and hold it.<a name=100:3></a> If the mass or sacrificial part is given up, this touches the knowledge by faith of the completeness of the one sacrifice, and our known forgiveness by it.<a name=100:4></a> There is no need of Syrian or Protestant commentators to know, that it is used for designating things they represent.<a name=100:5></a> It is the universal language of man.<a name=100:6></a> I say of a portrait, that is my father; that is my uncle.<a name=100:7></a> No one doubts an instant what it means.<a name=100:8></a> "It is the Lord's passover.<a name=100:9></a>" "I am the true vine.<a name=100:10></a>" "I am the door" is the converse.<a name=100:11></a> And it is as much and as surely said of <i>the cup</i> as of the elements: "this cup is the New Testament in my blood" -- thereby demonstrating the mode of speaking.<a name=100:12></a> As soon as the sense <i>attached by the church</i> to it is got rid of, our ordinary use of language would not convey the Roman sense to the mind.<a name=100:13></a> It is really an imposed one.<a name=100:14></a> Further, St.<a name=100:15></a> Paul positively calls it bread we break: why is this not literal?<a name=100:16></a> In what follows we have those figures which no language can speak without -- "the cup which we bless.<a name=100:17></a>" Was it the cup he blessed?<a name=100:18></a> Proper literality in the strict sense would make nonsense of all language -- is not its known sense.<a name=100:19></a> I drink a glass of wine -- who ever doubted what that meant?<a name=100:20></a> It is not, as men speak, the literal sense to give the physical one.<a name=100:21></a> He drew a picture of vice in his sermon.<a name=100:22></a> Who thinks he drew a picture!<a name=100:23></a> So in a nearer case; a man brings his sin (chattath) to the Lord.<a name=100:24></a> Christ "was made sin.<a name=100:25></a>" "These bones are the whole house of Israel.<a name=100:26></a>" Does any one doubt what it means?<a name=100:27></a> There are many such in Ezekiel -- only here we have no verb at all.<a name=100:28></a> And now as to the scriptural meaning and doctrine.<a name=100:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, if the Roman Catholic one were true, it would be a sacrament, not of redemption, but of non-redemption.<a name=100:30></a> That doctrine holds that the body, blood, soul, and divinity of the Lord Jesus are all contained in each of the elements.<a name=100:31></a> But if the blood be thus united to the body, there is no redemption at all.<a name=100:32></a> It is the blood shed which is redemption; and therefore we are called to drink it as a separate thing.<a name=100:33></a> It is a broken body we are told of, and shed blood.<a name=100:34></a> If the blood be in the body there is no redemption.<a name=100:35></a> Christ has not a life of blood now, for flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom.<a name=100:36></a> If I take it shed, I own the great and blessed truth of redemption: take it otherwise than separate and as shed, and it is a sign that there is none.<a name=100:37></a> And this leads me further: there is no such Christ in existence as that signified by the sacramental institution.<a name=100:38></a> There is a glorified Christ with a glorified body in heaven, but this is a broken body and shed blood -- that is, it is a dead Christ we, in the power of resurrection, recognise and feed on, that by which we were brought in -- that all precious sacrifice.<a name=100:39></a> But there is no dead Christ now.<a name=100:40></a> There cannot be a broken body and shed blood now.<a name=100:41></a> There is no such thing in existence, while faith knows all its value in the one blessed act of the cross.<a name=100:42></a> Hence further, it cannot be literal, or rather physically true.<a name=100:43></a> "This is my body which is broken," but it was not broken then.<a name=100:44></a> The living Christ did not hold actually and literally the dead Christ in His own hand.<a name=100:45></a> And this is absolutely necessary to the literal, or rather (without meaning to offend the feelings of those who have learned to renounce it) the gross carnal sense.<a name=100:46></a> The broken body and shed blood clearly represent a dead Christ; we know the unspeakable preciousness of that wondrous fact such as none is like.<a name=100:47></a> It is all our hope, the death of the Son of God; but there is no dead Christ in existence; hence it cannot be a physical reality.<a name=100:48></a> It is shed blood I need for my soul -- where is that literally?<a name=100:49></a> -- and further, it was not literally true then.<a name=100:50></a> Christ was not broken and His blood shed when He spoke to His beloved disciples.<a name=100:51></a> And yet this feeding on death is the very thing that is precious.<a name=100:52></a> A Jew dared not; it was death to him.<a name=100:53></a> But now Christ is dead, death is life and gain to us.<a name=100:54></a> Hence too we must drink His blood; that is, take it as shed out; "he that drinketh my blood.<a name=100:55></a>" The doctrine of concomitancy -- that is, a whole Christ in each element -- fails here; because the very point of power is drinking it, that is receiving it as shed, taking it as such.<a name=100:56></a>

		Hence, while I find that the literal is merely an imposed sense, contrary to the plain meaning of the words according to all habits of language, I find that it is on scriptural grounds -- as to the eternal truth of Christ's doctrine and Person -- an impossible thing; that is, contradicts the truth.<a name=100:57></a> There is no dead Christ now; but this is clearly a dead Christ.<a name=100:58></a> And further, that it subverts the sense and spiritual power attached by Christ to it -- His broken body and shed blood -- and makes it really, though unwittingly, a sacrament of non-redemption.<a name=100:59></a> Such is Satan's craft.<a name=100:60></a> Further, it cannot be literally true that Christ held Himself dead in His own hand: nor, as the breaking really represents His suffering and death, did He in any sense do this indeed at any time.<a name=100:61></a> Though after it He gave up His Spirit to His Father.<a name=100:62></a> Hence I lose all, by this pseudo-literal sense, my soul <i>wants</i>, my faith enjoys -- a suffering Christ, a dead victim.<a name=100:63></a> It is my salvation.<a name=100:64></a> I adore the grace in it.<a name=100:65></a> My soul feeds on it.<a name=100:66></a> I need it: I worship and joy in it, though humbled at what called for it; and my heart goes out to these sufferings, and to Him who endured them.<a name=100:67></a> But there is no such Christ now -- no dead Christ to be literally true.<a name=100:68></a> If it is not a dead Christ, <i>it is nothing at all to my faith</i>.<a name=100:69></a> If it is a dead Christ, it clearly cannot be a literal one, for we all together who love Him through grace rejoice in His exaltation.<a name=100:70></a>

		[W Kelly] [To the same.<a name=103:1></a>] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- There is a fund of grace in dear -- , but he has been in a bad school.<a name=103:2></a> Really -- 's humility (though he be a devoted man of God) consists in counting that they have infinitely more grace than any one else, and shew it in condescension.<a name=103:3></a> I know nowhere such amazing confidence in self.<a name=103:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		... This is associated with a kind of latitudinarianism which substituting grace in manner for fidelity, makes the supposed possession of superior grace a reason for swamping every principle of God.<a name=103:5></a> There is a tremendous deal of putting on of cant (forgive me the word, for I own the love under it at -- ) in it, but being flattery and looking like grace it wins people.<a name=103:6></a> It must be met kindly but decidedly, for it is insinuating and mischievous, and I think poisons the springs of christian simplicity and plainness.<a name=103:7></a> I should always meet assumption, whether in the form of superior grace or otherwise, as being entirely the contrary to grace.<a name=103:8></a> And I should be plain in principle, though not in the way of controversy; for the enemy is seeking to swamp it under this pseudo-charity in many a way.<a name=103:9></a> At any rate, dear brother, the exercise will do you good.<a name=103:10></a> You have had none to deal with at all <i>quis armis</i>, and your own grace and full trusting in the Lord will be tried.<a name=103:11></a> Lean on Him, and fight the good fight of faith.<a name=103:12></a> Never allow your own importance thus to come into question, while firm as a rock in disallowing all this false pretension.<a name=103:13></a> It is all pseudo-grace, though there be real grace in those who have it: much better to get at this and speak plain English than speak about grace and flatter.<a name=103:14></a>

		And now, while urging you to count on the Lord and fight the battle, His battle, yourself -- this is really called for: it is time we should rouse ourselves and buckle on our armour, if we have what is worth contending for, and not look merely to others to help, while I am sure I will render all the help I can; but it is a time of putting faith to the test, and they that quit themselves like men will not lose their reward.<a name=103:15></a> But I will now turn to your perhaps more important questions.<a name=103:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Authority in the church is neither more nor less than the power of the Holy Ghost.<a name=103:17></a> There may be added at the beginning the apostles as constituted companions of Jesus, and having directions from Him.<a name=103:18></a> But now this is simply the working of the Holy Ghost in the church.<a name=103:19></a> This may be in an individual, according to the measure of power given to him, or it may be in the body; but it will always recognise the Holy Ghost in the body and in all the members.<a name=103:20></a> This is most marked in the epistles.<a name=103:21></a> They speak as to wise men who have an unction from the Holy One.<a name=103:22></a> This is the whole matter: this once departed from, some mere arrangement takes its place, and the Holy host is in principle -- namely, in faith -- set aside, and weakness is soon apparent.<a name=103:23></a> The kingdom of God is in power; but that power is known only to faith.<a name=103:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to traditions, no one who has read the Greek Testament can a moment doubt that the word is, in the New Testament, a doctrine delivered, not handed down; though this might sometimes be the character of what was delivered.<a name=103:25></a> Tuvpon eij" on paredovqhte of Romans 6: 17 makes this plain.<a name=103:26></a> So tradition in the popular sense is in contrast with scripture.<a name=103:27></a> But in the passage you refer to [2 Thessalonians 2: 15], it is either the direct word of prophecy in the church there or the apostle's epistle: nothing handed down in the church is secured by subsequent authority.<a name=103:28></a> The saints were to keep the doctrine they had been taught -- the body of saints.<a name=103:29></a> Suppose I were to write to the body of saints in -- to hold fast what they had been taught, whether viv voce, or what I had written to them by letter, what would that have to say to the authority of the church or tradition of a subsequent era?<a name=103:30></a> Yet this is exactly the case, save that that teaching was divine and inspired, and therefore the exhortation had its peculiar place and weight: ta;" paradovsei" a" ejdidavcqhte, ei[te dia; lovgou ei[te di j ejpistolh'" hJmw'n clearly shews paradovsei" just to be a doctrine delivered.<a name=103:31></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nor do I see what the communication of what he had learned to faithful men [2 Timothy 2: 2], so as to form teachers, has to do with tradition.<a name=103:32></a> Nobody, unless they deny ministry, could gainsay this, and so far as a man could be trusted as receiving it from St.<a name=103:33></a> Paul, it would of course have weight; but that is just the question.<a name=103:34></a> It was not authority, but a means of communicating truth; the confounding these two things is the generally unperceived sophism of Milner's End of Controversy.<a name=103:35></a> A rule of faith, he says, or means of communicating Christ's religion.<a name=103:36></a> It must be plain, etc.<a name=103:37></a>; but these things are not the same.<a name=103:38></a> A mother does it to her babe, but she is not a rule of faith, perhaps does it perfectly rightly, but that alters nothing.<a name=103:39></a> Now here the apostle is directing the means of communicating truth to others, of course as surely as he can, but not setting up either authority or a rule of faith.<a name=103:40></a> When I had a dozen young men reading with me at Lausanne, I was doing this according to my ability.<a name=103:41></a> Was I dreaming of setting up authority or a rule of faith in them?<a name=103:42></a> Clearly not.<a name=103:43></a> The written word is clearly such the moment we own it inspired.<a name=103:44></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The real question is, Is it addressed to all saints as possessing the Spirit so as to use it?<a name=103:45></a> They are the church.<a name=103:46></a> Ministry may be a means of communicating, and a very precious one, as Ephesians 4; but they are never a rule nor an authority.<a name=103:47></a> A rule must be an existing quantum of doctrine, but this no men are.<a name=103:48></a> That as an authority must be infallible, which none is but God.<a name=103:49></a> Infallible is not perfectly right.<a name=103:50></a> I may say what is absolutely right, but I am not infallible.<a name=103:51></a> Whenever the apostles spoke by inspiration, they uttered in revelation what was absolutely right from God, but this did not make them infallible.<a name=103:52></a> God is, because in His nature He never can say anything but what is right.<a name=103:53></a> When God spoke by them, as every true Christian believes He did, they were absolutely right: but God remained the alone infallible, who never could of Himself say anything wrong.<a name=103:54></a> This was not communicated to an apostle, since if he did not speak by inspiration, he was as another man -- more experience perhaps, but a man.<a name=103:55></a> Inspiration comes from the infallible One, but does not render the inspired one infallible, but only perfectly right and divine in what he utters as inspired.<a name=103:56></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Further, I believe God will secure by His power that the truth shall not be lost in the church to the end.<a name=103:57></a> It may be only in an upright godly few, as when almost all the professing church and Pope Liberius among them turned Arian.<a name=103:58></a> But this does not make the church infallible; but it does prove that God will keep His elect in vital essential truth to the end.<a name=103:59></a> But being kept is not authority.<a name=103:60></a> I am persuaded I shall be kept in the truth for the end -- sure of it through grace; but this is not making me an infallible authority; it is just the opposite; I am subject to the truth.<a name=103:61></a> So the church, the elect saints, are subject to the truth always.<a name=103:62></a> They may have accompanying obscurities on many points, but they will never deny saving truth to the church.<a name=103:63></a> Many foolish things may be brought in and added, but it will not deny saving truth.<a name=103:64></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This the Council of Trent, and hence the Catholic body (I do not say every individual) have pretty much done.<a name=103:65></a> Hence the difference of the Establishment.<a name=103:66></a> The prayer-book has added a mass of destructive, false, and superstitious errors, but the articles in general, though obscurely, do not deny but proclaim saving truth.<a name=103:67></a> Hence the Galatians Paul was afraid of; they were on the point of denying really the saving truths, though recovered.<a name=103:68></a> The Colossians were introducing superstitions which led to this, but they were not met exactly in the same way, as they were not denying justification by faith for example, as the Galatians were well-nigh doing.<a name=103:69></a> But this is saving subjection to the truth, not authority; and this is the real point of difference.<a name=103:70></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		They say, with a law we must have an interpreting judge.<a name=103:71></a> God says, with My word I must have saving faith mixed -- the heart must bow to it itself; another cannot do this.<a name=103:72></a> No one denies that one can help another according to the measure of the Spirit -- that is, help spiritually the soul in reception; but this is not authority; it is ministry.<a name=103:73></a> The truth received has God's authority, and by the truth we are subject to Him.<a name=103:74></a> The word of God can have no authority to apply it, nor power either, but God Himself.<a name=103:75></a> Its whole object is to bring the soul and conscience into direct and immediate relationship with Himself.<a name=103:76></a> Interposed authority as to conscience sets aside God.<a name=103:77></a> There cannot be a judge with God's word, because Christ is.<a name=103:78></a> (There may be discipline, and, in this sense, judgment in which the whole body acts, but this is another question) but the whole point is the authority of God's word itself on the conscience; and mark, because God has said it, discerning it such, we set to our seal that God is true -- not that the church is.<a name=103:79></a> The church it is that believes it, and thereby it is the church.<a name=103:80></a> So "ye received it not as the word of man, but as it is in truth the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.<a name=103:81></a>" The church does not judge about the word of God.<a name=103:82></a> The word of God judges it, first as sinner then as saint.<a name=103:83></a> Whoever gets above this gets into sin -- is not a doer of the law, but a judge.<a name=103:84></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not enter here on the external part of the question, that the tradition, nor even the authority is not to be found, though <i>de facto</i> many things are surely believed.<a name=103:85></a> It is clear that the local priest is not, though he may be a means of communicating.<a name=103:86></a> It is quite clear that the ponderous tomes of councils are not a more clear, or accessible, or intelligible rule of faith than the living word.<a name=103:87></a> But the truth is they are not agreed when it resides in a Pope or Council; and this is serious.<a name=103:88></a> It will be said certainly in both.<a name=103:89></a> But the Council of Constance deposed, and that of Basle set itself above the Pope and ended without him.<a name=103:90></a> Also there were two, and neither owned by the former.<a name=103:91></a> And yet more.<a name=103:92></a> The Church of Rome cannot pronounce with unanimity which are the general councils.<a name=103:93></a> There are (I trust my memory) nineteen, but they dispute as to the enumeration of them.<a name=103:94></a> What a difference from the pure word of God!<a name=103:95></a>

		[W Kelly] [To the same.<a name=107:1></a>] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- It is very important to observe that Romanism does take infidel ground, and to press this on their consciences; I have often done so in Ireland.<a name=107:2></a> God is competent to make men responsible by speaking Himself.<a name=107:3></a> This is a most important proposition, and this is the one thing they have to defend, by His own testimony, that is.<a name=107:4></a> In their arguments there is a grand prw'ton yeu'do", namely, that the means of communicating Christ's religion is the same thing as the rule of faith.<a name=107:5></a> This is a fundamental fallacy of Milner's "End of Controversy.<a name=107:6></a>" A mother, a child, may be the means of communicating Christ's religion, but they are not a rule of faith.<a name=107:7></a> These two things may be united, but they are in no way the same things.<a name=107:8></a> I suppose the book you have, however, is Wiseman's.<a name=107:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I would take the bull by the horns, and say that there is no living saving faith whatever, but that which is wrought by the operation of the word of God, received on His direct authority without any warrant whatever.<a name=107:10></a> <i>If it is received on the authority of the church, it is not believing</i> GOD.<a name=107:11></a> The word of God <i>proves itself</i> to the conscience, and puts man by itself under the responsibility of crediting it, because God cannot speak without man's being bound to know and hear Him, for none speaks like Him.<a name=107:12></a> He may in grace use proofs and confirmations and witnesses, but man is bound to hear <i>Him</i>.<a name=107:13></a> God will prove that, in the day of judgment.<a name=107:14></a> Nay, the very heathen are <i>without excuse</i> on much lower ground.<a name=107:15></a> The reason is plain, too, <i>practically</i>.<a name=107:16></a> The word of God judges, and is not judged -- "he is convinced of all, he is judged of all;" and the secrets of his heart being revealed, he falls down and confesses "that God is in you of a truth.<a name=107:17></a>" That is not authority, but it is the only saving thing.<a name=107:18></a> A man does not want authority to know that a two-edged sword is sharp.<a name=107:19></a> A faith <i>founded</i> on miracles, though God vouchsafed this confirmation, is no saving faith at all; Jesus did not commit Himself to it (John 2), He knew what was <i>in man</i>.<a name=107:20></a> But then in the corruption of the church and its prevalent power, it may be a reason why none but those who receive the <i>love of the truth</i> should escape.<a name=107:21></a> But this power of the word by the Spirit acting on, not judged by, man, supposes the unbeliever; all else is no faith at all.<a name=107:22></a> But the church has the Spirit and the word, and the spiritual man judges all things.<a name=107:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence then, I first take the ground, that the word of God received on authority, is a rejection of God's testimony.<a name=107:24></a> If I receive an account of another because you put your name to it, it is because I do not believe the person who gives the account.<a name=107:25></a> God may providentially make it to be received where this genuine faith is not, but then it is not saving.<a name=107:26></a> To be saving it must be faith in God; "he that hath received his testimony, has set to his seal that <i>God is true</i>:" he who demands the church's authority to receive it <i>has not</i>.<a name=107:27></a> God may have used all manner of means of preserving, and even authenticating the testimony, and so He has in many as we might expect; and I believe that the scriptures were committed to the church to keep -- not to authorise, but to keep, as I keep a document safe.<a name=107:28></a> I give it no authority.<a name=107:29></a> It has its own.<a name=107:30></a> But I keep it safe.<a name=107:31></a> Now God, I believe, providentially has done this.<a name=107:32></a> But then the Roman body has decidedly failed in this, because at the Council of Trent, which is with them of divine authority, (it) has declared that to be scripture which <i>declares itself not to be so</i>.<a name=107:33></a> That is for example the [second book of] Maccabees, which concludes by saying, If I have done well, it is as befits the subject; <i>if ill, it is according to my ability</i>.<a name=107:34></a> Now it is <i>profane</i> to suppose for an instant that that is the Holy Ghost's inditing.<a name=107:35></a> The Prologus Galeatus indeed of Jerome, generally prefixed to the Vulgate, declares that the Apocryphal books are not scripture.<a name=107:36></a> Many other passages from the Apocrypha could be adduced, such as that the offerings for the dead were those dead in <i>mortal sin</i> -- that there are three contrary accounts of the death of Antiochus -- but I prefer the fact that one book of the Maccabees declares <i>it is not scripture</i>, as above.<a name=107:37></a> Moreover, it is well known, that Sixtus V.<a name=107:38></a>, acting under the authority of the Council of Trent, promulgated as the only authentic word of God an edition of the Vulgate, which was suppressed, because his successor Clement altered it in two thousand places; five copies only of it are in existence.<a name=107:39></a> Clement's bears in appearance its name.<a name=107:40></a> It has been in no sense, what the church ought to be, a faithful keeper of the "oracles of God committed" to it.<a name=107:41></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, after all, clever as Mr.<a name=107:42></a> Wiseman is, it is a vicious circle he is in; he takes the scripture as an authentic book.<a name=107:43></a> This itself then he supposes may be done.<a name=107:44></a> But if authentic, in the first place, it is clearly inspired, as any one who reads it may see -- that is, it gives us (to say the very least, for I think it goes further) an authentic account of the actual authoritative teaching of Paul, Peter, James, John, Jude, and of the Lord Himself.<a name=107:45></a> If this be so, I have no need of the church to receive its doctrine as divine.<a name=107:46></a> The authentic record of Christ's words and the apostles' teaching, gives me a divine instruction directly, which no reference to a <i>derivative</i> authority can set aside; because the body which would set aside or call in question the authority of that from which it derives, is not derivative from it at all.<a name=107:47></a> If it be then authentic, I have the original divine instructions which founded, formed, and guided the church itself at first.<a name=107:48></a> If it be not authentic, then to find that the church was founded proves nothing, for if not authentic, I do not know it is true.<a name=107:49></a> If I am to receive the church from it, I certainly can receive Christ's and all the apostles' words from it <i>directly</i>.<a name=107:50></a> But I may go further.<a name=107:51></a> If it be not inspired as well as authentic, and if I do not know it to be so, I have no inspired warrant, that is, no divine warrant for hearing the church at all.<a name=107:52></a> So that on this ground you cannot set up the authority of the church, without setting up previously the authority of scripture itself.<a name=107:53></a> The authenticity proves inspiration, or it gives no inspired authority for the church, and I hear all Christ's and the apostles' inspired words, as well as that as to the church.<a name=107:54></a> For if I receive something a person says, and not the rest, I receive none of it on his authority.<a name=107:55></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But indeed, when I examine the point further, I find the authority of this authentic book shewing me plainly a church indeed established, that is an assembly, but quite the contrary to the conclusion drawn from it.<a name=107:56></a> I find the test, of being of God, as to doctrine, to be, hearing the apostles themselves, "he that is of God <i>heareth us</i>.<a name=107:57></a>" But I have their authentic words in this book.<a name=107:58></a> I am not of God, if I do not hear <i>them, themselves, as the guard against error</i>.<a name=107:59></a> When I turn to hearing the church, <i>I find not a word about doctrine at all</i>, but a case of discipline (any rules of which, according to Catholic doctrine, are not binding unless where received, though decreed by a Council; though they allege decrees on faith are.<a name=107:60></a> The discipline of the Council of Trent was not everywhere received).<a name=107:61></a> It is a question of wrong done, carried to two or three, and at last before the assembly, and if the wronging party will not mind the whole body, he may be avoided by the offended one as a heathen.<a name=107:62></a> Whereas, I find the scriptures referred (to) as the security in perilous times, and the certainty of having received the doctrines from the apostles, <i>personally</i>, -- "knowing of <i>whom</i>.<a name=107:63></a>" I find the Lord (whose words all of us would bow to as divine) yet preferring, as to the medium of communication, the written word; "if they believe not his <i>writings</i>, how shall they believe my <i>words</i>" -- "they have Moses and the prophets, let them hear them.<a name=107:64></a>"

		Now if we separate the rule of faith from the means of communicating Christ's religion -- which last all admit may be, and is now fallible (consequently, the individual priest) -- where is their accessible rule?<a name=107:65></a> Is it in the acts of nineteen Councils (and which are they?<a name=107:66></a> For you are aware that Romanists are not agreed which the nineteen are), acts in Latin moreover, or in Greek?<a name=107:67></a> Where is this accessible rule of faith?<a name=107:68></a> And now further, Romanists are not agreed what the rule is.<a name=107:69></a> Ultra-montanes hold the Pope infallible.<a name=107:70></a> Cis-montanes hold he is not.<a name=107:71></a> Many, as the Councils of Constance and Basle, hold that they had authority to act independent of and superior to the Pope.<a name=107:72></a> At the time of the former there were two Popes.<a name=107:73></a> The Council deposed them and chose another, who (Martin V.<a name=107:74></a>) dissolved the Council.<a name=107:75></a> Is the Council of Constance a general council?<a name=107:76></a> If so, it has given an authority in matters of faith quite different from the Papal advocates; and it acted on it and deposed the Popes; and yet if it had not this authority, the whole succession of the popedom is founded on a schismatical act.<a name=107:77></a> However that may be, the authority on matters of faith Romanists are not agreed on.<a name=107:78></a> Not only so, but these Councils have decreed things against the Pope's authority, and he against theirs.<a name=107:79></a> The acts at Basle the Pope declared void after the departure of his legate, having transferred the Council elsewhere, though only a part left.<a name=107:80></a> But further, the Council of Chalcedon declared the equality of the Sees of Constantinople and Rome.<a name=107:81></a> This Pope Leo rejected.<a name=107:82></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now if a Roman Catholic say, I am not learned enough for all this; then I reply, Where is the simplicity and accessibleness of their rule of faith?<a name=107:83></a> For this is it.<a name=107:84></a> If you say, But I trust my priest; then you are on <i>confessedly fallible</i> ground.<a name=107:85></a> I had much rather trust, with God's help by the Spirit, the writings of Paul and Peter and John, etc.<a name=107:86></a>, addressed <i>to all saints</i> -- expressly so addressed.<a name=107:87></a> How fallible this is you may suppose, when I tell you that in the four standard catechisms published by the authority of different Archbishops and Bishops of Ireland, there are not the same lists of the seven deadly sins.<a name=107:88></a> But this is by the bye.<a name=107:89></a> But is not there a fearfully upsetting thing, that the moment I do turn to the Bible -- take the Roman translation -- I find it sets aside all the cardinal points of Romanism.<a name=107:90></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		For instance, the Mass -- I read, there is no more oblation for sin.<a name=107:91></a> I am told by the highest authority of the Roman system, that the Mass is a propitiatory sacrifice for the sins of the living and the dead.<a name=107:92></a> Yet take away this, and all Romanism falls.<a name=107:93></a> Again, there is one Mediator.<a name=107:94></a> Now the Roman system makes many, and in fact more referred to than to Christ.<a name=107:95></a> And it is in vain to say that it is only as praying.<a name=107:96></a> Their merits are positively acted on in the Missal, and the Virgin Mary is called upon to save us now and at the hour of death.<a name=107:97></a> Nay, so far is this carried, that the Confiteor on which absolution is received, <i>leaves out Christ altogether</i>.<a name=107:98></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The inadequacy of the scriptures to give unity is a mere claptrap.<a name=107:99></a> Has Rome produced it?<a name=107:100></a> Clearly not, unless by blood.<a name=107:101></a> Look at it from without.<a name=107:102></a> Authority, they say, was in the church from the beginning; if not, it is new, and good for nothing.<a name=107:103></a> Well, did it preserve unity?<a name=107:104></a> Witness the Greeks, Nestorians, Jacobites.<a name=107:105></a> Earlier, the Novatian system, Paulicians: Protestants -- half professing Christendom at this moment is outside their unity.<a name=107:106></a> But their authority being alleged to be the original effectual thing, it is clear then it has failed to preserve it.<a name=107:107></a> They tried by fire and blood when Protestantism arose, but in half Europe in vain.<a name=107:108></a> Present facts then prove its inadequacy to this end.<a name=107:109></a> To say that it promotes unity among those subject to it, is merely what the smallest sect in Christendom would say too.<a name=107:110></a> I remember a poor Romanist telling me nine-and-thirty religions arose out of the Bible.<a name=107:111></a> I told him I suppose his did, or it was good for nothing, which he admitted, and I told him then there were forty.<a name=107:112></a> And really the argument is worth no more!<a name=107:113></a> Nothing can produce unity, but the teaching and power of the Spirit of God.<a name=107:114></a>

		MY VERY DEAR BROTHER, -- .<a name=112:1></a>.<a name=112:2></a>.<a name=112:3></a> I suspect many brethren have had expectations, which never led me out, and which perplexed their minds when they were not met in practice.<a name=112:4></a> I never felt my testimony, for example, to be to the ability of the Holy Ghost to rule a visible body.<a name=112:5></a> That I do not doubt, but I doubt its proper application now as a matter of testimony.<a name=112:6></a> It does not become us.<a name=112:7></a> My confidence is in the certainty of God's blessing and maintaining us, if we take the place we are really in.<a name=112:8></a> That place is one of the general ruin of the dispensation.<a name=112:9></a> Still, I believe God has provided for the maintenance of its general principle (save persecution); that is, the gathering of a remnant into the comfort of united love by the power and presence of the Holy Ghost, so that Christ could sing praises there.<a name=112:10></a> All the rest is a ministry to form, sustain, etc.<a name=112:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Amongst other things government may have its place; but it is well to remember that, in general, government regards evil, and therefore is outside the positive blessing, and has the lowest object in the church.<a name=112:12></a> Moreover, though there be a gift of government, in general, government is of a different order from gift.<a name=112:13></a> Gift serves, ministers; hardly government.<a name=112:14></a> They may be united as in apostolic energy; elders were rather the government, but they were not gifts.<a name=112:15></a> It is specially the order of the governmental part which I believe has failed, and we are to get on without that, at least in a formal way.<a name=112:16></a> But I do not believe that God has therefore not provided for such a state of things.<a name=112:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do believe brethren a good deal got practically out of their place, and the consciousness of it, and found their weakness; and the Lord is now teaching them.<a name=112:18></a> For my part, when I found all in ruin around me, my comfort was that, where two or three were gathered together in Christ's name, there He would be.<a name=112:19></a> It was not government or anything else I sought.<a name=112:20></a> Now I do believe that God is faithful, and able to maintain the blessing.<a name=112:21></a> I believe the great buildings and great bodies have been a mistake: indeed, I always did.<a name=112:22></a> Further, I believe now (though it were always true in practice) the needed dealing with evil must be by the conscience in grace.<a name=112:23></a> So St.<a name=112:24></a> Paul ever dealt, though he had the resource of a positive commission.<a name=112:25></a> And I believe that two or three together, or a larger number, with some having the gift of wisdom in grace, can, in finding the mind of the Lord, act in discipline; and this, with pastoral care, is the main spring of holding the saints together in Matthew 18.<a name=112:26></a> This agreeing together is referred to as the sign of the Spirit's power.<a name=112:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not doubt that some may be capable of informing the consciences of others.<a name=112:28></a> But the conscience of the body is that which is ever to be acted upon and set right.<a name=112:29></a> This is the character of all healthful action of this kind, though there may be a recourse in present apostolic power, which, where evil has entered, may be wanting; but it cannot annul "if two of you shall agree .<a name=112:30></a>.<a name=112:31></a>.<a name=112:32></a> it shall be done.<a name=112:33></a>" So that I see not the smallest need of submission to popery (that is, carnal unity by authority in the flesh), nor of standing alone, because God has provided for a gathering of saints together, founded on grace, and held by the operation of the Spirit which no doubt may fail from want of grace, but in which every remaining gift has its scope; in which Christ's presence and the operation of the Spirit is manifested, but must be maintained on the ground of the condition the church really is in, or it would issue in a sect arranged by man, with a few new ideas.<a name=112:34></a> Where God is trusted in the place and for the place we are in, and we are content to find Him infallibly present with us, there I am sure He is sufficient and faithful to meet our wants.<a name=112:35></a> If there be one needed wiser than any of the gathered ones in a place, they will humbly feel their need; and God will send some one as needed, if He sees it the fit means.<a name=112:36></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is no remedy for want of grace but the sovereign goodness that leads to confession.<a name=112:37></a> If we set up our altar, it will serve for walls.<a name=112:38></a> (Ezra 3: 3.<a name=112:39></a>) The visibility God will take care of, as He always did; the faith of the body will be spoken of, and the unity in love manifest the power of the Holy Ghost in the body.<a name=112:40></a> I have no doubt of God's raising up for need, all that need requires in the place where He has set us in understanding.<a name=112:41></a> If we think to set up the church again, I would say, God forbid.<a name=112:42></a> I had rather be nearer the end to live and to die for it in service, where it is, as dear to God: that is my desire and life .<a name=112:43></a>.<a name=112:44></a>.<a name=112:45></a> .<a name=112:46></a>

		BELOVED BRETHREN, -- I saw so very few of you before I left, and for such a little moment, that I felt anxious to write a line, being separated from you in presence and not in heart.<a name=114:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When I took my place, my heart misgave me a little at leaving you all, but on looking to the Lord I felt it was more my natural heart, and that I was in the path of faith in going to France.<a name=114:2></a> I found on going home from the Friday prayer meeting, a letter which confirmed me in the purpose of going speedily, but what at the same time will shorten my absence some weeks at any rate, nor indeed is it my present purpose to be long out of England; my thought is to visit the south of France and return at once, or at any rate make no stay in Switzerland.<a name=114:3></a> The same faith which has led me, and made me feel right to go, gives me confidence, beloved brethren, that the Lord will keep you to the blessed testimony of His own faithfulness and grace.<a name=114:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would urge upon you walking in thorough unity, shewing all confidence one in the other, and casting all that may arise at once on <i>God</i>.<a name=114:5></a> His faithfulness to His church and people who trust in Him is infallible, and He cannot but help you in all for which you look to Him.<a name=114:6></a> I do not doubt His care over you.<a name=114:7></a> I trust that those who take part in any service needed for all, will do it together with common consultation, and that it will be done diligently as a duty.<a name=114:8></a> I say this, dear brethren, because uneasiness creeps in where this is neglected, and soon produces discomfort, which hinders both unity and blessing.<a name=114:9></a> It is written, "If two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.<a name=114:10></a>" There is another thing I have on my heart to say, that is, as far as brethren can, they should visit others; of course, they must wait on the Lord's leading for it, but it will minister to fellowship and unity in brotherly love, and that is our joy, beloved brethren.<a name=114:11></a> For the rest I commend you to the Lord; He will guide you in waiting upon Him.<a name=114:12></a> If we assume nothing at all beyond what we are, a company of poor saints waiting upon God according to His will, we shall infallibly meet Him in blessing.<a name=114:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe we are not properly aware, few, at least, of the unfeigned importance of the position He has set us in, in testimony of separation from evil and waiting on Him.<a name=114:14></a> But the secret of all strength in it is, assuming nothing -- not expecting to be like other Christians, as the Israelites, who would have a king like the Amorites and other nations, and thus falling back into the common path of unbelief, but truly waiting upon God.<a name=114:15></a> If there be gift, blessing Him for it, but swift to hear and slow to speak, counting God's presence more precious than all, and -- while desiring God's ordinance in the testimony of His word to sinners, and if any can give a public testimony, accepting it -- not counting the routine of a sermon necessary to the course of the saints.<a name=114:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Peace be with you, beloved brethren.<a name=114:17></a> May the Lord give you to work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, knowing that it is God that worketh in you to will and to do of His good pleasure.<a name=114:18></a> Give my love to dear old S.<a name=114:19></a>; I do trust that the brethren will visit him now that he cannot come out.<a name=114:20></a> Again, peace be with you all.<a name=114:21></a>

		I have a letter from dear -- , who is arrived at Bombay, and happily lodged at a Christian's; he says, "And I pray also the Lord that the brethren at Plymouth, who are simply gathered in the Lord's name, may never be dismayed in looking at their own weakness in meeting, but be glad that there is nothing to look to but to Him who is in heaven, the only One all eyes are fixed on, and that the brethren may constantly look for Him who will come and not tarry: yet a little while and we shall see Him face to face.<a name=114:26></a> In the moment we limit His coming, unconnected with any circumstances, we begin to make our nest in the foliage of this world.<a name=114:27></a> And the dear brethren too at Plymstock I do never forget; give to all of them my most affectionate salutations.<a name=114:28></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a long letter, with all the details of his voyage, and some interesting particulars as to his search into the prophetic question, which I cannot here give.<a name=114:29></a> Peace be with you, most beloved brethren.<a name=114:30></a> Be of good cheer.<a name=114:31></a> Glory with Christ is ours; the love of Christ is ours.<a name=114:32></a> Only let us trust the Lord, and we know not how much blessing is in store for us, though we ought to know how faithful, how infallibly faithful He is.<a name=114:33></a> The Lord has led out several to labour here of the younger brethren, and I have found others whom I trust He is so leading.<a name=114:34></a> I trust quite He is working.<a name=114:35></a> He has led me wonderfully every step of the way.<a name=114:36></a>

		[to a poor brother at Bath] VERY DEAR BROTHER, -- I have heard little in the way of news since I left England.<a name=119:1></a> A letter dear -- wrote to me in April I only received in June.<a name=119:2></a> Since then I heard from -- , both of whom, in the midst of other matters, mention that the question of Mr.<a name=119:3></a> N.<a name=119:4></a>'s coming to Bath had been raised there.<a name=119:5></a> As I understand, our brother B.<a name=119:6></a> has laid his ground of objection in the doctrines Mr.<a name=119:7></a> N.<a name=119:8></a> taught.<a name=119:9></a> I am entirely ignorant of what brethren at Bath have done, but it is fair that they should know what is in question, if the question be raised.<a name=119:10></a> Now I entirely agree with dear B.<a name=119:11></a> in the difficulty he raises.<a name=119:12></a> I am satisfied that Mr.<a name=119:13></a> N.<a name=119:14></a> is unsound in the most important fundamental doctrines, so that if no Plymouth question had been raised, I never could consent that souls should be under his teaching.<a name=119:15></a> I am perfectly satisfied that he undermines the truth of Christ's Person, and justification by faith, and that he has done so, and made souls miserable by it; but I know that he would deny it all, and state opposite statements with the greatest force, or if pinned to a statement made, explain it all away the moment it was objected to.<a name=119:16></a> All these things have happened, and I should be prepared with instances .<a name=119:17></a>.<a name=119:18></a>.<a name=119:19></a> but it is well that brethren should know that Mr.<a name=119:20></a> N.<a name=119:21></a> and the whole five stand accused of systematic falsehood where there is no heresy at all.<a name=119:22></a> -- has declared that their statements were so utterly false, so entirely untrue, that not only he would not break bread, but that as an honest man and a Christian, much as he loved some of them, he would not sit down in the same room with them.<a name=119:23></a> For my own part, I can only say, I never saw <i>such effrontery and falsehood in all my life</i>.<a name=119:24></a> Mr.<a name=119:25></a> J.<a name=119:26></a> L.<a name=119:27></a> H.<a name=119:28></a> declared that had Mr.<a name=119:29></a> N.<a name=119:30></a> been an attorney or an officer he would have been struck off the rolls.<a name=119:31></a> Mr.<a name=119:32></a> McA.<a name=119:33></a> and Mr.<a name=119:34></a> N.<a name=119:35></a> confirm, as far as they are concerned in it, their testimony.<a name=119:36></a> Mr.<a name=119:37></a> R.<a name=119:38></a> H.<a name=119:39></a> declined further correspondence, it grew so bad, and they had to reject the testimony of their own friends in London to get rid of the proof of falsehood there: the path was such as left no trace of doubt in the minds of brethren .<a name=119:40></a>.<a name=119:41></a>.<a name=119:42></a> .<a name=119:43></a>

		The assumption of position by these brethren in the assembly is such, that no person who has any conscience could admit of it; it is pure popery.<a name=119:44></a> Now it would be very easy to gain a reputation, dear brother, for charity, by passing loosely over all these things.<a name=119:45></a> But as I am convinced that it is the power of Satan, and that they corrupt every soul they have to say to, the service of the Lord and faithfulness to Christ are more important than a good reputation and the favour of man.<a name=119:46></a> I could easily, being here, avoid the responsibility, but I do not choose to run away from the difficulty when my brethren are in it .<a name=119:47></a>.<a name=119:48></a>.<a name=119:49></a> .<a name=119:50></a> This is my feeling as to the dear brethren at Bath.<a name=119:51></a> They have a right to know what they are about.<a name=119:52></a> A great body of beloved brethren are from personal acquaintance convinced that it is the work of Satan.<a name=119:53></a> They can say why; and nothing would induce them to go where these persons were.<a name=119:54></a> The brethren, if it is proposed to them to receive them, or even if they come to attract them by smooth speeches and fine words, have a right to know on what ground they refuse to have anything to say to a meeting where they are.<a name=119:55></a> Many have declared why, as before the brethren in London, and have entirely satisfied them, the rest refusing to come.<a name=119:56></a> Brethren must feel, that supposing they receive persons, whom the brethren best informed and who owe fidelity to Jesus, believe to be doing a work of Satan, it is impossible for them who have this feeling to go along in any way with those whom they judge such.<a name=119:57></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Peace is pleasant, but it could not be purchased by making terms or being at concord with Satan, or those who produce his fruits in the church.<a name=119:58></a> My own conviction, I need not say, is most decided, and unqualified decision is my only path.<a name=119:59></a> The more I weigh, the more decided I am.<a name=119:60></a> Four other brethren have declared that they have the conscience of having been under the direct power of Satan whilst giving in to them.<a name=119:61></a> I have seen besides many souls delivered from it, where it was as evident as a first conversion.<a name=119:62></a> I have not seen one who gave in to it, who maintained his integrity.<a name=119:63></a> This will make you feel, however reluctant some may be to say what they know and have said in private, or when the Lord forced them to it, that where there is fidelity there is decision, and that indecision is unfaithfulness, and that is all.<a name=119:64></a>

		-- As in the Psalms, I do not at all admit that they are <i>all the language of our Lord</i>.<a name=121:1></a> Even as to some in which His voice is unquestionably heard, there are other voices also.<a name=121:2></a> For instance (Psalm 102), where the cry of the blessed Jesus is answered in words quoted by the apostle in Hebrews 1, as addressed to our Lord by God Himself.<a name=121:3></a> So in Psalms 20 and 21 it is rather the voice of those who pray and give thanks on behalf of Jehovah's Anointed that we hear than His own.<a name=121:4></a> At least they express their interest and concurrence in His desires, and then acknowledge how all these desires are fulfilled to the uttermost.<a name=121:5></a> I have no doubt that in all the Psalms <i>the Spirit of Christ</i> is to be heard, and that the grand theme of that Spirit's utterance is "the sufferings of Christ and the glories that should follow.<a name=121:6></a>" But all this does not prove that the Psalms were all <i>uttered</i> by Christ <i>as His own language</i> at the time He was here on earth.<a name=121:7></a> Some of them were so uttered without doubt.<a name=121:8></a> But as to most of the Psalms, they have evidently a different character.<a name=121:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a well-known passage in Romans 8: 26, 27, which, more clearly than anything, illustrates, as it seems to me, the character of the Psalms.<a name=121:10></a> In Romans 8 the intercession is that of the Spirit in Christians, and therefore according to the place given us and the calling wherewith we are called.<a name=121:11></a> In the Psalms it is the remnant of Israel that is in question.<a name=121:12></a> But how is the passage in Romans 8 to be understood?<a name=121:13></a> We who pray know not what we should pray for as we ought; but the indwelling Spirit helps our infirmities, making intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.<a name=121:14></a> How are the prayers thus inwrought by the Spirit of God?<a name=121:15></a> Not according to the poor, feeble, measure of our personal intelligence and desires, but according to the perfect expression of these requests by the Spirit, and according to the value and acceptance of Christ and His work, through which it is that the Holy Ghost has come to make our bodies His abode.<a name=121:16></a> "He that searcheth the hearts knoweth" (it does not say our mixed, feeble, imperfect desires, but) "what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to God.<a name=121:17></a>" His intercessions are <i>according to God</i>; while, alas!<a name=121:18></a> our apprehensions and utterance of them always fall short of this.<a name=121:19></a> Still, what the Searcher of hearts finds in us -- that which He hears and receives -- is this mind of the Spirit -- this intercession of His according to God.<a name=121:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now it is something analogous to this that we find in the Psalms.<a name=121:21></a> The circumstances are different: it is another body of people; and in general the blessings sought for are different.<a name=121:22></a> The <i>people</i> are the Jewish remnant; the <i>circumstances</i> in many, perhaps most, of the Psalms, are those of the final tribulation through which these chosen ones are to pass; and where this is not the case, the circumstances are those of one period or another, past or future, in the history of the remnant.<a name=121:23></a> The blessings sought for differ in two very important respects from those for which we should seek.<a name=121:24></a> On the one hand the supplicants evidently do not stand in the consciousness of God's manifested favour, as the church now stands; and, on the other, they seek deliverance from their complicated and unexampled afflictions by imploring the execution of righteous judgment on their adversaries.<a name=121:25></a> In the Psalms we have the confessions, the prayers, the lamentations, the faith, the hopes, the thanksgivings, the worship of this chosen remnant; not according to the feebleness and imperfectness with which they may be actually uttered, but according to the perfect expression of them by the Spirit of Christ, who did identify Himself with this remnant in a most special manner, and whose Spirit will as truly incite in them the desires, etc.<a name=121:26></a>, thus expressed, as He does now make intercession for the saints with groanings which cannot be uttered.<a name=121:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the remnant, and Christ's identification of Himself with it, several points need to be observed.<a name=121:28></a> First, there always was such a remnant, from the time that Israel became apostate, till the time when "the remnant according to the election of grace" became, along with the Gentile converts to the faith of Christ, the church of the living God.<a name=121:29></a> I suppose, too, we all agree that there will be such a remnant in the days to come.<a name=121:30></a> Further, there have been times of crisis in Israel's history, when the remnant, or those composing it, have been brought into special distinctness.<a name=121:31></a> David and his companions, whether in the days of Saul or of Absalom; Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, and in general, the prophets; and then most especially the disciples of our Lord during His sojourn below, furnish specimens of what the remnant was in the several critical periods in which they lived.<a name=121:32></a> Ezra and Nehemiah, with the returned captives of their day, afford another example.<a name=121:33></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I do confess that, as far as I have any light on these subjects, it seems to me incontestable, that it was with this remnant, not with the nation at large, that Jesus in grace identified Himself.<a name=121:34></a> And, whatever may be the measure of the manifested favour of God, or whatever the amount of spiritual intelligence enjoyed by this remnant in any period, past or future; and whatever may be their circumstances of outward trial; and in whatever degree their outward trials may be augmented by the lack of that assurance of God's favour, in the knowledge of accomplished redemption which it is our happy privilege to enjoy; <i>their relation to God</i> is one of peace and blessing, and that by virtue of the perfect sacrifice of Christ.<a name=121:35></a> They are not at once introduced into the knowledge and power of this relation, as we are immediately on believing in Jesus.<a name=121:36></a> They have to endure all the outward afflictions which are contained in their cup of sorrow, with the far deeper anguish of receiving them as the tokens of God's righteous displeasure against the sins of the whole nation, with which sins they identify themselves in confession and humiliation before God.<a name=121:37></a> But then, the very fact of their thus confessing their own and their nation's sins, distinguishes them from that nation, and shews that they are the people of God's choice.<a name=121:38></a> And, however dark may be their condition outwardly, and even inwardly as to any sense they have of God's dealings with them; and however unheeded their cry may seem to be, and this is surely the bitterest ingredient in their cup; yet, that cry is the cry of the Spirit of Christ in them, and He, blessed be His name!<a name=121:39></a> did, in the days of His flesh, and that too, in circumstances most similar, anticipate all their affliction.<a name=121:40></a> He did in spirit, as identifying Himself with them, pass through it all; yea, and more, for He did, as we rejoice to know, bear all <i>their</i> sins as well as <i>ours</i> in His own body on the tree.<a name=121:41></a> He thus endured atoningly the wrath which they dread; and the sense of their having deserved it, that is, this wrath, draws forth lamentations and mourning from their hearts.<a name=121:42></a> Where now is the difficulty in apprehending how Christ could and did voluntarily enter in spirit into all the depths of their agony and distress, and thus give expression to it all before God according to the perfectness of His apprehension of their state, and of what the claims of divine majesty and holiness are?<a name=121:43></a> He thus prepared for them utterances which will be perfectly, because divinely, adapted to their state when they are in it; and which will constitute a cry as entirely "according to God" as are now the intercessions of the indwelling Spirit in the saints of the present dispensation.<a name=121:44></a> This is as widely different a thing as possible from Christ being by birth associated with the natural condition of man and of Israel, so as to be Himself in it, and so as to need to be extricated, or to extricate Himself therefrom.<a name=121:45></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is, of course, agreed by all, that for them, as well as for us, Christ made atonement.<a name=121:46></a> In several of the Psalms, we distinctly hear Christ Himself pouring out the sorrows of His own soul to God, as thus bearing our sin and theirs, confessing them as His own, and appealing (wondrous, affecting, unexampled fact!<a name=121:47></a>) to the God -- His God -- who had forsaken Him!<a name=121:48></a> owning Him in such words as, "But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel.<a name=121:49></a>" It is on the alone ground of this atoning work, that any sinner can be brought into acceptable relationship to God.<a name=121:50></a> It is on this ground that the remnant we are contemplating are brought into such a relationship.<a name=121:51></a> Now it was with the remnant of His day that our Lord did associate Himself when on earth.<a name=121:52></a> From the mass of the nation He did entirely disassociate Himself.<a name=121:53></a> Even the closest ties of kindred in the flesh had to give way.<a name=121:54></a> "Who is my mother?<a name=121:55></a> and who are my brethren?<a name=121:56></a> For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, my sister, and mother.<a name=121:57></a>" (So also in Psalm 16: 2-3.<a name=121:58></a>) There "the excellent of the earth, with whom," says Christ, "is all my delight," are set by Him in contrast with "those who hasten after another god.<a name=121:59></a>" He identifies Himself with the one class; He utterly disowns the other.<a name=121:60></a> In like manner it was with the remnant of every period, that His sympathies, as expressed in the Psalms, were found.<a name=121:61></a> And such were, I doubt not, His sympathies, that He did enter in spirit fully into all that they had, or have yet to endure; but the language in which this sympathy is expressed must not be understood as His language <i>personally</i>, as to His own relationship to God; but as <i>their language</i>, in which, by the Spirit of Christ, <i>what becomes them in their state</i> is uttered; and uttered, not in the measure of their dark and imperfect apprehensions, but according to the perfectness of the Spirit, who incites the desires, and has prepared this perfect vehicle for their expression.<a name=121:62></a><a href="#121:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>

		[E Maylan] [From the French.<a name=129:1></a>] VERY DEAR BROTHER, -- I write a line in haste, having at heart the course of the brethren with regard to these elections which are about to take place.<a name=129:2></a> I found that the brothers at verse had scarcely reflected at all on the bearing of an act which was making them take part in the course of the world.<a name=129:3></a> Thanks be to God, from the moment when that was presented to them they saw the thing, and, I hope, clearly.<a name=129:4></a> This has led me to think that perhaps the brothers near you may not have reflected upon it either.<a name=129:5></a> It seems to me so simple that the Christian, not being at all of this world, but united to Him who died and rose again, has no business to mix himself up with the most declared activity of the world, by an act which affirms his existence as belonging to the world, and his identification with the entire system which the Lord is about to judge; that I think the truth has only to be presented in order to be acknowledged by those who have understood their position; so much the more that these events<a href="#129:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> place the world more manifestly (not more really) on its own ground, but more really near the great catastrophe which is about to fall upon those who rise up against God.<a name=129:6></a> Oh how my soul longs that His people should be separated to Him, and even with understanding of what is awaiting the world, and still more of what they ought continually to await themselves!<a name=129:7></a> May God give the grace to be faithful in bearing this testimony, and everywhere, according to the door that He will open, in season and out of season; for His own, so dear to Him, need it.<a name=129:8></a>

		[Major Lancey] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I most gladly answer your letter as far as the Lord enables me: perhaps we shall see each other, the Lord willing, in Dublin soon.<a name=131:1></a> I distinguish entirely between the church and prophecy.<a name=131:2></a> I do not believe the church is the subject, though it is the recipient and depositary of prophecy, as Abraham was of what should happen to Lot.<a name=131:3></a> The church has its own proper present relationship to Christ, out of which the scripture does not know it, but it (having received the Holy Ghost) has the mind of Christ.<a name=131:4></a> You may except the description of the heavenly Jerusalem, but which is really description, not prophecy of events, though connected with, and closing, and crowning them, when the heavenly government is brought into full connection with the earth.<a name=131:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Prophecy gives the career of <i>earthly</i> events, the wickedness of man, or the dealings of God.<a name=131:6></a> But the church is not earthly; its life is hid with Christ in God; it has its place with Christ while He is hidden; when He appears it will appear; we await the manifestation of the sons of God.<a name=131:7></a> Hence it was hid in God from the foundation of the world (Ephesians 3), and the prophets do not speak of it.<a name=131:8></a> Only it is true that it maintains (or ought to have maintained) the testimony to the kingdom, during the interval of the rejection of the Jewish witness.<a name=131:9></a> As inheriting the promises as being in Christ the seed of Abraham, it comes in and maintains by divine wisdom their constancy and unfailingness.<a name=131:10></a> But the age is the same age as that in which Christ was upon earth -- "the harvest is the end of the age.<a name=131:11></a>" Hence the church cannot be the subject of prophecy.<a name=131:12></a> It <i>was</i> not -- as being a kind of wisdom hid in God and now made known to principalities and powers, and <i>now</i> it is not -- the subject, but the depositary of prophecy, not earthly but heavenly, though on earth in testimony of what is heavenly, and of a hidden Christ with whom it is as one.<a name=131:13></a> Hence what relates to it is, as I have said, only seen when it comes down out of heaven having the glory of God.<a name=131:14></a> Hence it has no place in prophecy.<a name=131:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are properly nowhere, save in the extraordinary suspension of prophetic testimony, or period, which comes in between the sixty-ninth and seventieth week of Daniel, or at the end of that age which was running on when Christ was here, the close of which was suspended by His crucifixion; His return to establish it then, according to Acts 3, being precluded by the rejection of the testimony of the Holy Ghost, which followed -- finally declared at Stephen's death.<a name=131:16></a> Whereupon the doctrine of the church in union with a heavenly Head, without distinction of Jew or Gentile, was fully revealed, and entrusted to Paul, who had joined in that rejection, in a ministry, beginning not at Jerusalem but Antioch.<a name=131:17></a> In the Revelation therefore, until the heavenly Jerusalem is revealed, the church is never, properly speaking, seen at all.<a name=131:18></a> The living creatures or twenty-four elders may be taken, as to which I do not decide, as a symbolical representation in part of those who compose it, viewed in certain positions, but I certainly apprehend that the period spoken of in the Revelation (or from chapter 4) is the interval between the removal of the church from the place of testimony, and the manifestation of it in a glorious testimony, as already stated, in chapters 21, 22.<a name=131:19></a> Whether this has had a partial fulfilment since the church failed in giving a testimony on earth at the beginning, and there were but a few imperfect witnesses, I will not say.<a name=131:20></a> I daresay it has, but whatever general principle of a year-day system may be admitted, there is no proper literal fulfilment of it, I apprehend, but in that which is to come, in which on earth as such the church will not be witness at all.<a name=131:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The great point for us is, to get distinctly the church's place, and the church's faith, and the church's own distinctive relationship as bride of Christ, to be revealed with Him, and to be faithful during his absence.<a name=131:22></a> What knowledge is given us of others, and of God's ways towards them, and of their witness when the church is not there, is dependent on the sovereignty of God in gift, and our faithfulness in our walk in our place.<a name=131:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The present course of events is not revealed signs to me, but the church ought to discern these times.<a name=131:24></a> It is the rapid, but, as I judge, for the present arrested, development of the spirit of the latter day, which will issue in apostasy and delusion on one hand, and in the forming of the Roman Empire on the other, and the preventing collision between northern and western Europe till the great catastrophe takes place in Palestine.<a name=131:25></a> Signs, I judge, are for those who have not been faithful enough to keep or find the bride's position (we are "children of the day"), a mercy to those in the latter-day circumstances, but which would not have been needed had they apprehended the church's place, and been separated from the world to be in it, and taken the properly heavenly place wherein we await only the marriage with the heavenly Bridegroom, who comes to receive us and takes us there where He is.<a name=131:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such, dear brother, is the grand answer to your inquiry.<a name=131:27></a> If this, in connection with your own thoughts, suggests any difficulties, I shall be most glad for myself to hear them from you -- it is thus we learn -- and, if the Lord afford time, to answer them.<a name=131:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I write from the midst of much occupation.<a name=131:29></a> I have sixteen long letters to answer besides yours, so I say adieu.<a name=131:30></a> Peace and grace be with you.<a name=131:31></a> Salute the beloved brethren with you, though I know them not by sight.<a name=131:32></a> In Jesus we shall know each other.<a name=131:33></a>

		DEAR -- , -- I think there is a rather increasing impression on reflection that the Dublin Meeting was a happy one, that is, that it was not merely the joy of the moment, but blessing from God.<a name=133:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I feel for the Compton Street brethren, but I think that their path might have been a simpler and happier one, and that they have somewhat complicated it themselves; however, this does not take it out of the way of the Lord's grace, nor hinder others meeting the case as it is in the wisdom and grace of His Spirit .<a name=133:2></a>.<a name=133:3></a>.<a name=133:4></a> .<a name=133:5></a> I should trust the Bath meeting was decidedly useful; but I judge the brethren in general have moral position to recover.<a name=133:6></a> It seems to me that, from the character of the evil in certain points, when ascertained, they ought to have said, Mr.<a name=133:7></a> Darby or Mr.<a name=133:8></a> Anybody is not concerned here; God is in question, and the dishonour done to His name is what we have to think of as between us and you who have used it, for it was used in the most solemn way to support what is now admitted untruth.<a name=133:9></a> Here I think the brethren were not on the high ground the church of God ought to take.<a name=133:10></a> I do not speak of the evil in individuals now, but the ground the brethren were upon; they allowed themselves to be led into the question of blame to me, which was a mere subordinate question, an escape from the great point.<a name=133:11></a> However there it is.<a name=133:12></a> I feel what they did not take up, and which, in the position they had allowed me to be put in, I could not help them in, I must take before God; that is, recognise the fact as to the state of things as work yet to be done by His grace, which I wait upon Him to do.<a name=133:13></a> As to myself, the Bath meeting, however disagreeable, could hardly have been more mercifully satisfactory; but I think, as I said, there was a want of moral dignity.<a name=133:14></a> These form elements of judgment in one's path.<a name=133:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord is working most graciously here, and, I judge, really reviving the brethren's testimony in these latter days; but I see He will not allow half positions.<a name=133:16></a> How sad, but how necessary, that any should be forced to the division.<a name=133:17></a> Peace be with you.<a name=133:18></a> I wait upon the Lord to direct it all to a quiet issue -- His own in grace.<a name=133:19></a> As far as any love on my part to the Compton Street brethren could do anything, I think I can say it would not be wanting, waiting only on the Lord for spiritual judgment.<a name=133:20></a>

		[From the French.<a name=134:1></a>] Here at length, dear sister, is your turn coming, rather late, you will perhaps say; but I assure you that the letters absolutely requiring an answer are so numerous, in addition to other occupations, that I can hardly get through it, and then the consequence is, that my answers when I do write any, are so dry, that I am sorry for my friends who receive them; but I did not wish to leave yours without replying a word, and I seize a moment I have gained by dint of working.<a name=134:2></a> Thank God, I am very happy in my work, so that I have nothing to complain of in having work.<a name=134:3></a> But we have more than three hundred in communion, and the responsibility of the course falls upon me, and you know something of what that is.<a name=134:4></a> They go on well, and confidence exists, and I hope increases, but it is just by paying attention to a thousand little things, and by bringing them to God, that this takes place, things that no one else perhaps hears of, but if the details of them were not cared for there would be difficulties and uneasiness, and when it is done they think all goes on by itself.<a name=134:5></a> This is not all I desire, but there is much happiness, and I so love to devote myself to the welfare of the dear children of God, that I am encouraged in Him even when painful little matters arise, as always happens.<a name=134:6></a> However, when there is confidence, every one looks to God, and these cases do not injure the general health; on the contrary, they become an occasion for unitedly seeking His wisdom and grace, and He helps us and blesses us with a sense of His presence.<a name=134:7></a> You know a great number of those who were still at Ebrington Street left it, being convinced of the bad doctrine, which indeed was dreadful; among others the principal teachers.<a name=134:8></a> This occupied me very happily, but in renewing bonds which had been so long interrupted.<a name=134:9></a>

		As for dear Switzerland, I am indeed rather a stranger there now.<a name=134:10></a> My affections are not weakened, God knows; but I am His servant, too happy in being so, and in being permitted to be so, and I have had the conviction that, for the present, France is the field for labour, not at all to prevent me from going to see our dear Swiss brethren, but as a field of work.<a name=134:11></a> God has brought several over there, and all I believe have felt it.<a name=134:12></a> This might easily change.<a name=134:13></a> Circumstances had somewhat decided the case for the moment, and God led me.<a name=134:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When I felt that I should pay them a visit I did so, not knowing whether I should not be sent back from the port of Ouchy itself, and all was guarded.<a name=134:15></a> For the present we have been able to hold our meetings, even at the Casino, a remarkable intervention of God.<a name=134:16></a> Now I do not know how it would be; if I thought it to be His will, I would return as before.<a name=134:17></a> Meanwhile I have been labouring in France.<a name=134:18></a> I have felt constrained to leave that country also for the moment, although doors were open on many sides, and God blessed me, and has arranged for the work being done without me, and better done I doubt not.<a name=134:19></a> Here I have everything to bless God for, I have seldom been able to do so much in as little time.<a name=134:20></a> I hope all the same soon to leave for the south, and if it is God's will, and He opens the door, it would be a great joy to me to revisit Switzerland.<a name=134:21></a> In these times it is doubly happy to have this precious gospel to announce to this poor world.<a name=134:22></a> I felt it so in our manufacturing districts, where society is really morally quite disorganised by selfishness -- the masses restrained, it is true, but no bond.<a name=134:23></a> How happy to be able to tell them, "There is one at least who loves you," and to present Jesus to them, and Jesus in all His sympathy, as a remedy for even deeper evils than luxury and the greed of gain plunge them into.<a name=134:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What a world we are living in, if one knows something of the details, and views them with the eye of God.<a name=134:25></a> It is surprising what peace the thought of the return of Jesus gives, and not a selfish peace, for He will restore happiness to the world, and re-establish moral relations according to His mind; judgment will unite with righteousness, and then the goodness of God will shine forth in happiness.<a name=134:26></a> However, in the midst of the French Revolution, where all was disorder and alarm, I was afraid of losing in some measure the height of my expectation: I had been very happy in the thought of His coming, from the point of view of the heavenly home, united to Him where He will be.<a name=134:27></a> When the Revolution broke out, His return became rather a resource than a purely heavenly joy.<a name=134:28></a> I blessed God that there was such, but I feared that would lower the feeling a little, but I was very happy.<a name=134:29></a> The only thing I found rather troubling me, was the reports of all kinds which were filling minds, but I refused to listen to them any longer, and I never (so) felt how God keeps His people through everything, and that His care was independent of everything, and above everything; this did me much good.<a name=134:30></a> The Christian passes through the world happy, if he does so through love to the Lord, when the world is peaceful, and then there is nothing to lose, when the world is against him.<a name=134:31></a> But I felt deeply that not a hope, not a joy, nothing was lost if everything broke up.<a name=134:32></a> As for personal danger, there really was no question of that unless some unexpected circumstances arose; but as for complete ruin here below, it was never seen so near, and it is well.<a name=134:33></a> But one learns in all circumstances that Christ is all.<a name=134:34></a> What I desire is that He may be so completely everything in the secret of each day, that it may be an accomplished fact in the outward relations of life; that faith may detach, so that there is nothing to break, nothing to lose, except what God recognises in a certain sense, our bonds with the church here below, for Christ exercises our affections in this way to make Himself everything to our souls in every way; but our hearts are so dreadfully frivolous that we need it.<a name=134:35></a>

		I have been happy and blessed in writing in French on l Samuel since I have been here.<a name=134:36></a> One ever learns more, and learns it everywhere, that all is spoiled here below; Ichabod is written on the relations of God Himself with the world, at least, of men with Him.<a name=134:37></a> But then one finds that faith finds its way through all.<a name=134:38></a> Jonathan could act, and David could suffer, and acting with an energy that had no equal, silence it when the divine instinct of the Spirit's leading shewed him the way, and retire towards God, instead of being driven from His presence by evil, or revenging himself when an opportunity occurred.<a name=134:39></a> The fear of God is a very remarkable element in the power of faith in his character; and in what a touching way God came to his help in the case of Nabal.<a name=134:40></a> Abigail had got further into intelligence of the ways of God, it appears to me, than Jonathan; the latter is a remnant more purely Jewish: he does not suffer with David, whereas Abigail apprehended his position.<a name=134:41></a> Saul is only a <i>man</i> in her eyes, and she takes part in his (David's) sufferings; when God has judged Nabal she has much more the character of the remnant which becomes the church.<a name=134:42></a>

		Dearest G V Wigram, -- We are, thank God, very happy here, though there is much to gain, yet I believe He is working really, and there is a happy spirit .<a name=137:1></a>.<a name=137:2></a>.<a name=137:3></a> .<a name=137:4></a> What a mercy when the blessed Lord acts in the church -- rest of course we cannot expect here; the trial of faith is connected with praise, and honour, and glory, at <i>the appearing</i> of Jesus Christ.<a name=137:5></a> But there is that kind of rest which is in going from strength to strength, a rest to refresh for journeying in the wilderness.<a name=137:6></a> And hence the importance of that kind of faith that works in the dark.<a name=137:7></a> It is not met, as the reverse is, by "he shall not <i>see when good cometh</i>;" but when this is rested in, it soon wanes; God will not give us what would take the eye off the end, because this alone fully gives the moral trial which exercises and purifies -- yea, gives intelligent capacity for the end.<a name=137:8></a> The Christ, seen, leads into the capacity for enjoying and being with Him at the end.<a name=137:9></a> This I believe was absolute and perfect in Him; hence, "the author and finisher of faith.<a name=137:10></a>" The point for us is to rest in the arm of the Lord, whatever may be, and not run to get help elsewhere, or before, as He meets in power moral perfectness, whether full as in Christ, or in degree or detail: this is the great burden of the Psalms.<a name=137:11></a> The judgment of God in this sense is but the bringing the display and sanction in power, of principles acted on, when apparent power -- nor its open exercise -- was not seen.<a name=137:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And this, I take it, is the bearing of prophecy.<a name=137:13></a> Some will have principles in it, some naked facts as testimony, but I apprehend that the facts, which we have to take quite simply however, are the display of God's power in judgment of, and public sanction of, certain principles as approved of Him.<a name=137:14></a> I have the principles, I have them, but have them in practice by the way, and then judgment returns to righteousness; and so righteousness and peace meet.<a name=137:15></a> All this is connected with prophecy; but we have a higher thing, the affections which flow out of relationships with Christ -- present, though not fully accomplished relationship.<a name=137:16></a> And these affections do form morally, and in the sweetest way, more than in mere righteousness.<a name=137:17></a> And to this, I take it, the coming of the Lord and the marriage of the Lamb is the answer, not judgment: still, the other is true, and hence I distinguish between the coming of the Lord and prophecy (though this last by the way), though one acts on the other, because He has associated us with His competency to judge the world and all, though the authority is with Him.<a name=137:18></a> But this shews what a very high place the church is in.<a name=137:19></a>

		Dearest Ralph Evans, .<a name=138:1></a>.<a name=138:2></a>.<a name=138:3></a> And now to the other point you ask about.<a name=138:4></a> It is well to remember that symbolical statements are a language, but a language, like others, modified by the context.<a name=138:5></a> I have no doubt that [Revelation] 12 begins a new subject.<a name=138:6></a> That is, the definite bringing out of the details of the introduction of divine government in the Person of the Son of man, King of kings, and Lord of lords, not the mere general preparatory actings of providence, but the immediate agents in the scene.<a name=138:7></a> Verse 19 of chapter 11 is rather introductory to chapter 12, than in its right place.<a name=138:8></a> The temple of God is opened in heaven, and the ark of the covenant which secures the blessing of His people is seen there.<a name=138:9></a> It is not merely the throne there, nor the rainbow, but the ark of the covenant; of this on earth, Israel we know was the centre; this, in which we know the government of the earth is concerned, is what we now enter on -- chapter 12 introduces the parties.<a name=138:10></a> A woman clothed with the sun and twelve stars on her head, and ready to be delivered, and the dragon ready to devour the child.<a name=138:11></a> The child then is born, caught up, and the woman (now seen in her actual condition) flies into the wilderness for 1260 days; this I judge is the last three and a half years.<a name=138:12></a> This, note, closes this part.<a name=138:13></a> Verse 7 begins another division.<a name=138:14></a> In the opening part the woman is seen in the thoughts of God, and I apprehend is the vessel of the accomplishment of His purpose, perfectly weak in herself, but out of which strength is to come, and which is to be clothed with supreme authority, the twelve stars being perfection in humanity (as seven, spiritual things), or rather completeness, as twelve tribes, apostles, etc.<a name=138:15></a> The moon -- I have somewhat more difficulty, but will say a word in a moment of it.<a name=138:16></a> Now this is, in fact of accomplishment on earth, to be in the Jews, and I judge that when we arrive at the historical facts, we get into the Jewish people as owned of God.<a name=138:17></a> Now to them Christ the Son was born (though they owned Him not at first, but now we are speaking of God's view of the matter).<a name=138:18></a> The Son and the strong one who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron, was born to this people in the view of God, and as Benoni in anguish and agony (Benjamin is, I doubt not, a type of Christ in strength as head of the Jewish people, as people of His exaltation -- meanwhile over Gentiles and to God's throne), but when born He does not use the power, nor deliver, but is caught away; but then as Israel is the matter in question, nothing is introduced of church connection, and the woman (Israel) owned of God on earth, but not delivered, flies, and is the object of Satan's rage, the Man child having gone where he cannot touch Him.<a name=138:19></a> Now the church is only brought in as being identified with Christ Himself, here according to the promise of Thyatira.<a name=138:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thereupon the historical course of events is gone into, which leads to the driving out of the woman, and the real character of the period, from verse 7 to the end of verse 17.<a name=138:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now as to the moon under her feet, I take it, it relates to the entire setting aside of the old phases of Israel, as responsible to God; without the man, and security of Messiah, this character she had lost; she was not to blow up the trumpet in the new moon -- God's restoring the reflection of His power or light rather than keeping up the light where the sun was not.<a name=138:22></a> She was permanently clothed with the sun itself; she was not the sun, but she was clothed with it, weak as she was in herself.<a name=138:23></a> I do not know that I have more to add as to the general principles; the setting up the power of the kingdom, though not yet applied to the earth, is when Satan is cast down, on the war in heaven -- not saving grace -- this is power, but the accuser is cast down.<a name=138:24></a> This puts the church, if the man child refer to that (also out of the scene and historical course of events) -- out of the scene, nor does it take the warrior power.<a name=138:25></a> The angels act here.<a name=138:26></a> I leave open the question how far there would be application to any who enter into the heavenlies, as the second class who live and reign, of chapter 20.<a name=138:27></a> The general view I think clear: as far as I see, the whole analogy of prophetic truth and order sustains it, but I shall be glad to give any further details I may be able, and to search out any points (the Lord leading) that further questions may suggest.<a name=138:28></a> We are at peace, and I trust enjoying blessing here.<a name=138:29></a> Some seventy or upwards have returned among us since the last move and inquiry.<a name=138:30></a> Peace be with you, dear brother, and the Lord's near presence -- our only safeguard and joy the sense of it.<a name=138:31></a>

		Dearest G V Wigram, -- .<a name=140:1></a>.<a name=140:2></a>.<a name=140:3></a> I cannot acquiesce in the want of faith which sets aside God's original testimony.<a name=140:4></a> It was just this that made me think it a very important point,<a href="#140:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> because God is jealous; and giving up what He has purged, and so very mercifully rescued and set up again, would not be recognising and honouring His goodness; but then when you do it, as your cover shewed me, individually, that was merely a question of individual state or condition, and the question before God as to owning His goodness was dropped.<a name=140:5></a> If there is faith to join with the purged and renewed testimony, it is well.<a name=140:6></a> I do so, and have no difficulty, and I feel He is at this moment doing it, as Plymouth in its locality is witness.<a name=140:7></a> That the restoration is feeble on our part is true, but as such better quiet in fact as it is here.<a name=140:8></a> They are all coming quietly as they get free .<a name=140:9></a>.<a name=140:10></a>.<a name=140:11></a> .<a name=140:12></a>

		I have, when maliciously hinted at abroad, always openly said, the devil has done his best to upset the testimony, but, thank God, has not succeeded.<a name=140:13></a> Now if you or any person called of God to it, has faith for it, it might be, and I suppose would be, very right before God to consider whether any publication should be taken up on this ground if done modestly, for I think that becomes us.<a name=140:14></a> It would honour the Lord's goodness I believe in the way of faith; but if not, I have no difficulty as to an individual publication of papers that might profit saints on its own bottom; I see no harm in it at all.<a name=140:15></a> I see no need that it should be collectively done (that is, the other) -- collective faith you would find hard to find now.<a name=140:16></a> You must have in a measure in the present state of things, faith for them, not with them.<a name=140:17></a> But then that sometimes begets it in them, because it brings them before God, and they find God answers it.<a name=140:18></a> Were I mixed up with it as editor, I should look to act upon the faith I have as to the Lord's goodness -- poor enough it is after all.<a name=140:19></a> But I have no difficulty as to individuals acting on their own, in individual acts.<a name=140:20></a> As I said, as to any papers I might have that would profit, they would be for one or the other equally, nor is there any good in any one attempting to go beyond their faith .<a name=140:21></a>.<a name=140:22></a>.<a name=140:23></a> .<a name=140:24></a>

		[From the French.<a name=145:1></a>] DEAR SISTER, -- .<a name=145:2></a>.<a name=145:3></a>.<a name=145:4></a> I am glad that you are making experience of the value of that inner life which is developed in communion with the Lord.<a name=145:5></a> The outward life, however blessed it be, can never give us that which is here communicated.<a name=145:6></a> It is the knowledge of Christ that matures the soul.<a name=145:7></a> It is true that to neglect our duties is not the means to make progress in it.<a name=145:8></a> For He communicates Himself, and we cannot command communion outside the path of His will, while in the accomplishment of that will, we dwell in His love.<a name=145:9></a> However, the blessedness that accompanies it never produces the effect without that which flows from having the soul exercised before God, who places it, such as it is, in connection with Himself, and with all the resources of His grace, by making it feel its condition to which that grace applies -- or rather, finding occasion in that condition to communicate the knowledge of the grace.<a name=145:10></a> Thus the soul is more established, distinguishes better that which is of the Spirit, that which belongs to Christ from that which assumes the form of it, and knows infinitely better how to say I know in whom I have believed.<a name=145:11></a> But God chooses His opportunities to teach us these things, and when He has accomplished His end, the special communications of His wisdom and His love no longer continue, for He desires we should walk by faith, according to what we know we possess in Christ; but it is none the less true, that our path is in company with a Christ much better known, and in much more communion with Him.<a name=145:12></a> But after having received the instruction, we have to return to the ordinary activity of a life of duty, and to those relations with our brethren in which charity is developed and exercised, as it is put to the proof, either in the assembly or in individual intercourse; unless God takes us away to enjoy the happiness for which He has prepared us by His grace -- an easier and happier change.<a name=145:13></a> His will however is always perfect, and His grace and wisdom are found in our return to ordinary life.<a name=145:14></a>

		[E Maylan] [From the French.<a name=146:1></a>] VERY DEAR BROTHER, -- Here I am in the Pyrnes, and happy enough with the brothers, considering the short time I have seen them.<a name=146:2></a> I have passed one Sunday with them.<a name=146:3></a> There is simplicity in their meetings, which B.<a name=146:4></a> has cultivated.<a name=146:5></a> There have been conversions, and in general I see that there is a sincere desire to glorify the Lord: it is not, I think, a deep and experimental study of the word that distinguishes them, although they have received a degree of light through B.<a name=146:6></a>'s means.<a name=146:7></a> But there is a measure of freshness in their affections.<a name=146:8></a> I also spent nearly eleven days in Pau, where I truly felt much the leading of the Holy Spirit, which has done me much good.<a name=146:9></a> One saw the word of life and truth laying hold of souls and forming them and fashioning them for Christ; I speak of souls converted or attracted.<a name=146:10></a> It is remarkable when God works, the manner in which the truth becomes as a living part of the soul, and this refreshes the heart .<a name=146:11></a>.<a name=146:12></a>.<a name=146:13></a> .<a name=146:14></a> Up to what point all will persevere is what I cannot tell.<a name=146:15></a> Many had been of the national church before my arrival, and it was they in general who gave me the greatest pleasure, the truth had been received with the heart.<a name=146:16></a> Some will leave Pau, but it is a place for which we must pray, for there are people opposed who will seek a middle course suitable to lead away souls.<a name=146:17></a> But I have left them however with joy, feeling that I can trust them to God.<a name=146:18></a> This visit has refreshed me.<a name=146:19></a> We also read together every day.<a name=146:20></a> I have also been at Clairac; there is some good there, and a few persons who feel the need of something better, and I hope that God is working there also.<a name=146:21></a> Good is being done also it appears at Nrac.<a name=146:22></a> I was not able to go to St.<a name=146:23></a> Foy.<a name=146:24></a> But these places are worth the trouble of caring for them, and praying for them, for God is working there.<a name=146:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was only yesterday that I returned here, and I hardly know the state of the work, but I believe that doors and hearts are open to good, but that the actual measure of it is small.<a name=146:26></a> Anyway, there has been an evident movement of the Spirit.<a name=146:27></a> What need we have to cast ourselves entirely on Him in the work, and how simple it is when we do this!<a name=146:28></a> There is one thing that gives strength, it is to keep close to Christ.<a name=146:29></a> God works at the same time for us, and gives us refreshment, but our part is to keep close to the Lord.<a name=146:30></a> The pressure of the work without that, even of that work which is our duty and our business down here, contracts the heart, tends to make us lose that largeness of heart, that capacity of presenting the love of God freshly to souls, which alone can truly introduce into this world the element that it needs -- that these poor souls, withered and unhappy through sin, have need of; and if one has a heart large and full of love apart from this nearness to Jesus, the love evaporates itself into mysticism, in that which is human under pretext of being divine.<a name=146:31></a> It is not that I believe that in the work one will be always in that liberty which sees all in the light.<a name=146:32></a> It is necessary to walk by faith, sometimes.<a name=146:33></a> Alas, tremblingly at least, the best workmen have borne witness to it; a St.<a name=146:34></a> Paul, an earthen vessel, himself responsible, placed in a contest between the Lord and the enemy of souls, will feel sometimes the shock of the battle, seeing that it takes place in him and by him and the forces that are engaged.<a name=146:35></a> It is true that the Holy Spirit always places us beforehand in the pure and fresh region of a redemption which leaves no longer any question of sin for us.<a name=146:36></a> The flesh being in us, we shall be all the more confused, if there is not practical diligence, but we are there.<a name=146:37></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		After all, it is but for a little while, and to form us for the enjoyments which surpass all that we can conceive, but of which we have sometimes glimpses as to their nature; and being rooted and grounded in love, we possess the place and source of it all.<a name=146:38></a> It is a profound source of joy to know that the God whom I know, who is mine, is He whom I shall know for eternity, and that I do not need another.<a name=146:39></a> I know Him in Jesus, I have known Him as Father, it is He whom my heart desires, and whom my heart knows.<a name=146:40></a> There is not another, nor could be, that one should desire or know -- the only true God.<a name=146:41></a> There is a difference between desire and love.<a name=146:42></a> Desire has need of something for itself, holy though it be; love possesses and delights in that which is its object.<a name=146:43></a> Now God in revealing to us the perfection of our salvation, has placed us in this latter position; only being infinite, He is always in Himself that which gives this energy that seeks the knowledge of Him -- depths in Himself beyond what we possess of Him.<a name=146:44></a> But it is in Christ that all our thoughts are adjusted, set right, judged and purified; for the infiniteness of God Himself staggers the littleness of the heart of man when Christ does not give him a sure support; without depriving him of anything of the fulness which is in God, but quite the contrary, it is in Him that we appreciate what He is, and near Him.<a name=146:45></a> This is what is found in St.<a name=146:46></a> John; we dwell in love, in God; where do we find ourselves?<a name=146:47></a> By this we know love, because He gave His life for us; what more true, more simple, more real, more near to the heart?<a name=146:48></a> and a love accomplished, proved, and that certainly is ours.<a name=146:49></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I close.<a name=146:50></a> I am constantly thinking of Nismes, but I wait on God.<a name=146:51></a> I have been so retarded in my work and movements, that I hardly know how to arrange for the season of work, but God will shew us, and I have always a visit to the mountains at heart, to see those dear brethren.<a name=146:52></a> Salute them warmly for me.<a name=146:53></a> May the blessing of God rest on your family.<a name=146:54></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		[Mons.<a name=149:6></a> Eynard] [From the French.<a name=149:7></a>] DEAR BROTHER, -- While travelling I read your "Life of Madame de Krdener," and I must tell you that it did me good.<a name=149:8></a> Occupation, without any relaxation, tends, if one is not very near the Lord, to impair the most intimate affections; and when the details of the work constitute the chief part of such occupation, they tend to narrow the heart.<a name=149:9></a> It is not so, the moment one is near Him; then, on the contrary, such details exercise the best affections, and we delight ourselves more in Him.<a name=149:10></a> It was so with Christ, because His life of details flowed from the fact that He lived by His Father, and was nothing else than the perfect manifestation, in Man, of what the Father was; the produce of a heart filled with perfect love, the expression of an infinite love.<a name=149:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The life of Madame de Krdener, which was passed outside the narrowness of secondary questions, recalled to me this love; for she certainly had a heart of spiritual love for the Lord; and, for my part, I have no difficulty in judging the things that are to be condemned in her walk, so that I need not dwell upon them.<a name=149:12></a> The one who is constantly a working bee within the hive, is free to gather only honey when he alights on flowers in the open air, whatever they may be.<a name=149:13></a> But I will say a few words as to what strikes me when I consider mysticism, as it is found in its best forms in Madame de Krdener and others.<a name=149:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Desire and love may be very exactly distinguished.<a name=149:15></a> Desire supposes the capacity to enjoy the thing we desire, that is to say spiritual affections, which as to their very nature, have God for their object; it supposes one to be born of Him, though Satan often, in an astonishing manner, imitates this class of feelings; but this state also supposes that one does not possess what one desires.<a name=149:16></a> Love supposes that we have full possession of the object of our desires.<a name=149:17></a> It is no longer a need for oneself, but it is enjoyment, appreciation, in delighting in it, of the object itself.<a name=149:18></a> Now mysticism, while boasting much of its feelings, never gets beyond desire; while simple Christianity, giving the knowledge of salvation, puts us into full possession of the love of God.<a name=149:19></a> I know that He loves me as He loves Christ; that love has saved me; it was He who desired me.<a name=149:20></a> In love He had need of me; and this love is perfection in Christ.<a name=149:21></a> In peace I contemplate this love, and I adore it in Christ.<a name=149:22></a> I dwell in Him and He in me.<a name=149:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have never seen a mystic whose idea of love was not entirely at fault in its very nature; it was something in man, which needed to be satisfied, instead of being something in God, which satisfied the heart profoundly, infinitely, and perfectly.<a name=149:24></a> Thence, unheard-of efforts to abase oneself, to vilify oneself, and to speak evil of oneself, as if a saved one could be anything in the presence of a Saviour, instead of being nothing and forgetting himself in the presence of so much love.<a name=149:25></a> When one is truly delighted in the presence of God, and beholding His excellent beauty in His temple, is one occupied with the hideous forms which hide themselves in the heart of man?<a name=149:26></a> I think not.<a name=149:27></a> We think of Him.<a name=149:28></a> He has given us the right to do so, by a grace which has really set aside all that we were as alive out of Christ, as in the flesh.<a name=149:29></a> Do we then make no humbling experience of self?<a name=149:30></a> I say not so.<a name=149:31></a> Yes, there are moments when God reveals to us the frightful secrets of that heart in which no good exists; but we do not boast, we do not say much of it, if we have truly seen God.<a name=149:32></a> If we try to find in man, in his love to God, something as good as the love of God to us, then we talk about it, and fancy we are humbling ourselves.<a name=149:33></a> This is but the vanity of the heart which knows not God, and knows not itself either; it is the true character of mysticism.<a name=149:34></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But does not such a sight of God produce a humiliating knowledge of self?<a name=149:35></a> Yes, when we have not known what we are, nor known the gospel which gives us the right to say, "It is no more I that live.<a name=149:36></a>" Such was the case with Job, as with many others.<a name=149:37></a> He had thought of himself, of the grace in him; then he had to learn himself in the presence of God.<a name=149:38></a> But the gospel is the answer to all these disturbances in the soul, by the revelation of what God is, and of what God has done for him whom He knew to the bottom, just as he was, and who has learned, in the cross of Jesus, what the love of God is when there was nothing but sin, and sin seen by God as we could not see it, but seen only to be the occasion of a perfect work of love.<a name=149:39></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God, His holiness, His majesty, His righteousness, His love, has found His rest in the work and Person of Christ: I have found mine there.<a name=149:40></a> The mystic never has rest, because he vainly seeks in man what he ought to seek in God, who had accomplished all before he ever thought about it.<a name=149:41></a> This is why they seek a <i>disinterested love</i>; but where?<a name=149:42></a> In man!<a name=149:43></a> Poor worshippers of man, deified in their imagination; of a man who will never be found.<a name=149:44></a> Here, sin is in him; in heaven he will think only of God.<a name=149:45></a> This is why the imagination plays so great a part in mysticism, and Satan can so often deceive by it, because the imagination and the heart of man are called into play.<a name=149:46></a> I do not say that spiritual affections are never there: far from it; nor that God never reveals Himself to such affections.<a name=149:47></a> I doubt not that He does, and thus renders the person happy, but you will find him, after all, occupied with these affections and not with Him.<a name=149:48></a> It is the chief defect of mysticism.<a name=149:49></a> In a word, I see in it an effort of the human heart, trying to produce in itself something strong enough in the way of affection to satisfy a heart awakened by the excellence of its Object: for I am now supposing a true awakening of the heart.<a name=149:50></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Christ I see a divine heart, reflecting the perfect certainty of a love whose perfection cannot be questioned.<a name=149:51></a> It is peace.<a name=149:52></a> Now He says to us, "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you.<a name=149:53></a>" What peace is expressed in those words: -- "I know that thou hearest me always, but because of the people that stood by I said it.<a name=149:54></a>" This peace is ours.<a name=149:55></a> (1 John 5: 14, 15.<a name=149:56></a>) What peace even in those words, "I know whom I have believed," as well as in so many other passages.<a name=149:57></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Are there not, then, these exercises of the soul's desire before God?<a name=149:58></a> Yes; but this again brings out a marked difference.<a name=149:59></a> Before having understood redemption through the cross and our portion in Christ, which is its consequence, the awakened soul is exercised; it often seeks peace and rest in a spiritual progress and love for God which are never found: but the effect of all this exercise, under grace, is to bring the conscience into play and to produce the conviction of its uselessness; that in us, that is in our flesh, dwells no good thing.<a name=149:60></a> Conscience takes full account of what passes in the heart and of what we are, so that we are brought to renounce all attempt to find peace in the state of our souls.<a name=149:61></a> We need to be pardoned, saved; we place ourselves at the foot of the cross, but not as having immutable affections.<a name=149:62></a> We have discovered that we have them not; and it is not only the heart which is troubled by this, although that is the case, but conscience knows that we are lost, dead under condemnation.<a name=149:63></a> We see things as they are in the presence of God; we need to be saved.<a name=149:64></a> We no longer seek good in ourselves, under the form of divine affections, but we find it in God, in His kindness towards us by Christ Jesus; we have peace.<a name=149:65></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Have the deep affections with which the cross inspired me ceased, because I am no longer crushed with the sense of need?<a name=149:66></a> No; conscience has intervened, and has set me in my place.<a name=149:67></a> What God has done, what He is, has given me peace; and now I have divine leisure (because nothing is uncertain in my relations) to contemplate that which is perfect in the object of my affections, without being occupied with myself.<a name=149:68></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The mystic humbles himself because he still hopes to find good in himself, or he occupies himself in this, as if there might be some, and he finds only evil.<a name=149:69></a> The Christian is humble (and that is quite another thing), because he has given up seeking good in himself, to adore the One in whom there is nothing else.<a name=149:70></a> Now it is not that he deceives himself, but that the intervention of conscience, by the light of the Spirit and the truth, has put him in his place.<a name=149:71></a> I believe, for example, that Madame de Krdener only fully reached that position in her last illness.<a name=149:72></a> This is what often happens.<a name=149:73></a> The Moravians, while sweetly enjoying Christ, often remain at this point.<a name=149:74></a> She was under the obligation of love; a true thing, but she did not know it.<a name=149:75></a> She knew that God was love, but she wished to be it also; and this is closely allied to pride of heart, until we have taken our place, as dead in our trespasses and sins, and have understood love towards us in that Christ died, and that we are dead and risen in Him
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The truth is this: there is still conflict, because the flesh is in us, and the Holy Ghost has sometimes to occupy us with ourselves, and to humble us.<a name=149:76></a> God being infinite and His work perfect, there is always in Him, even when our peace is perfect, that which awakens all the energy of an affection which cannot satisfy itself, although perfectly assured of the love of Him whom it beholds.<a name=149:77></a> This suits the relations of a creature with God, and it is happiness for us and does not detract from our peace.<a name=149:78></a> It is quite a different thing from the mystic desire to love, which is true, but which turns upon self, because it knows neither God nor self.<a name=149:79></a> Yet I find my heart so cold that it sometimes does me good, because I know well enough that I was lost and am saved, not to mix this with my knowledge of a free salvation, accomplished without me, and which fully glorifies God, and God alone: but it often does harm to souls who have not been emptied before God, not having had the work transferred from the heart to the conscience in His presence.<a name=149:80></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is astonishing from how many errors this delivers, without a word being said.<a name=149:81></a> My human affections may attach themselves to the Virgin, but conscience .<a name=149:82></a>.<a name=149:83></a>.<a name=149:84></a> ?<a name=149:85></a> Is there any blood-shedding there?<a name=149:86></a> The Virgin is no more, as to that, than the most miserable sinner: she is a creature before <i>God</i>.<a name=149:87></a> Purgatory, the pretended repetition of the sacrifice, absolution, holy unction, and many other things vanish without controversy, like shadows, like apparitions of darkness in the face of the light, before a conscience which has already found itself, such as it is, in the presence of God, and has there been thoroughly purged by the knowledge of His work in Christ.<a name=149:88></a> The needs of conscience may throw a sincere soul into these superstitious practices, but for a purged conscience which knows God they are nothing.<a name=149:89></a> This is what gives me such horror of a system which traffics with the terrors of conscience to hide the love of God; manifestly the work of the enemy.<a name=149:90></a> But see, to say no more, in the Epistle of John, which touches the borders of mysticism, but with the finger of God, in what a manner, side by side with the highest elevation of communion with Him, he always replaces the soul on the simple ground of salvation by objective faith.<a name=149:91></a> This is what corrects the heart of man with his wings of Icarus.<a name=149:92></a> (Chapter 4: 7-10, and even the whole chapter.<a name=149:93></a>)

		Now, a few words upon your work.<a name=149:94></a> You are conscious that it is rather intended for the world, so that it must be considered with respect to this.<a name=149:95></a> A life of Madame de Krdener carries us into the midst of emperors, queens, and titles.<a name=149:96></a> I make up my mind to it.<a name=149:97></a> One loves to see grace everywhere; that grace which despises neither great nor small.<a name=149:98></a> However, the ways of God are different when He acts in the power which is proper to Him.<a name=149:99></a> The world is then left in its true place, and His Son, and His apostles, and His servants, are arraigned before the great men sitting as a tribunal, and this turns for a testimony.<a name=149:100></a> It is thus that God causes His voice to penetrate into places most distant from Him, while preserving, in its perfection, the character of His own, and of that which belongs to Himself.<a name=149:101></a> I admire His grace which deigns to act otherwise; but I admire His perfection such as He has Himself presented it to me.<a name=149:102></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have said that I take for granted the worldly form of the book, and that thus you have left to each the responsibility of forming a judgment for himself on the worldly life of Madame de Krdener, by passing lightly, and without remark, over her wanderings; the grace which pardoned all, being the true contrast to the evil.<a name=149:103></a> It seems to me, however, that while admitting the principle that it is a life you are writing and not a sermon, the fact of having left her husband a second time, after his great indulgence towards her -- of having again formed painful connections at Paris (and I would insist even more on the first step) -- shewed a want of conscience and of moral spring in Madame de Krdener, that the world even could and ought to have felt.<a name=149:104></a> Her husband, it is true, was no husband as to the inward ties of her moral existence; but the kindness which replaced her anew in a moral position ought to have awakened the sense of it if one had it.<a name=149:105></a> I think that this reproduced itself, and is found again in her spiritual wanderings, for the ways of God are righteous.<a name=149:106></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have yet another objection to make to you.<a name=149:107></a> It seems to me that your desire to win the world, has led you to the mistake of introducing the letter from Monsieur de Frgeville.<a name=149:108></a> I do not admit that even the world calls such things "a pure homage.<a name=149:109></a>" After these remarks, which I make in all freedom, I come to her life after her conversion.<a name=149:110></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Her devotedness inspired me with the deepest interest.<a name=149:111></a> It is refreshing in this selfish world, the slave of formality, which is of use to hide itself behind because it is too ugly to be seen, and to preserve its selfishness as intact as possible without avowing it -- a world without heart -- a world without independence because it is without heart -- it is refreshing, I say, to find something which overleaps the barriers and acts from motives which shew heart and love -- that love which is the only true liberty.<a name=149:112></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus the devotedness of Madame de Krdener interested me much, and also humbled me.<a name=149:113></a> The little that I have had of it in my life makes me enjoy hers, and it has been so little that it makes me admire what I see in her.<a name=149:114></a> But here also I find the ways of God.<a name=149:115></a> When the devotedness came directly from Him and was manifested in her ways, the energy found there became realised in a result which was altogether of Him, and was preserved from the seductions of the enemy.<a name=149:116></a> Now God can never abandon His ways.<a name=149:117></a> If man abandons them, even while devoting himself, the complement is of the enemy under one form or another.<a name=149:118></a> One sometimes wonders that a good part of the life of a devoted and spiritual person should be spent in mistakes and wanderings; one asks oneself how the presence of the Spirit of God, necessary to produce this life, comports with these mistakes.<a name=149:119></a> I say, on the contrary, that as regards the government of God, it is a necessary consequence.<a name=149:120></a> Can God place His stamp of approval upon that which is contrary to His thoughts?<a name=149:121></a> Will He refuse blessing in answer to real devotedness, because there is error?<a name=149:122></a> He cannot sanction the former, nor refuse Himself to the latter.<a name=149:123></a> What is the consequence?<a name=149:124></a> Blessing is found, as well as His tender care.<a name=149:125></a> He maintains the foundation even through all the wanderings, but He abandons to their natural consequences the evil, and the false confidence which accompany it; otherwise He would be justifying evil.<a name=149:126></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If the work of Madame de Krdener had had the character of that of Paul, the seal of God would have been upon that which was contrary to His will.<a name=149:127></a> The mercy of God does not permit this.<a name=149:128></a> An ardent woman, hasty, full of imagination, acting under impressions and influences, subject to the excitement of circumstances -- such was Madame de Krdener.<a name=149:129></a> The principle at bottom being divine, that is found in the work: Satan meddles with it; he always makes use of the flesh when we allow it to act.<a name=149:130></a> This is the history of all these cases.<a name=149:131></a> If people judged themselves healthily, if they were in the truth before God, there would be no difficulty in unravelling them.<a name=149:132></a> But God does not explain these things to those who have them not; this would be again to sanction evil, although He may bring us out of this state by grace, and He is faithful not to allow us to be tempted beyond our strength.<a name=149:133></a> If we wait upon Him there is no danger.<a name=149:134></a> If we rush on, He must let us see the consequences of it.<a name=149:135></a> If there exists the foundation of that which is spiritual, it will be found again in eternal happiness; but, in the government of God, each thing brings its own consequences.<a name=149:136></a> He can, in grace, and honouring the instrument, make use of a repentant and devoted woman; He has done it in His grace; but an excited woman, and one who it seems to me was little sensible of what she had been, is not a perfect instrument according to the ways of God, for carrying on a work.<a name=149:137></a> We see the consequences of this, in order that the perfection of the ways of God may be known.<a name=149:138></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe even that a certain state of things in the kingdom of God, in Christians, does not admit of a perfect instrument and mode of action according to the thoughts of God.<a name=149:139></a> It would be out of place; it would not even do His work.<a name=149:140></a> It may remain an extraordinary thing, but I do not know what the apostle Paul would do (or rather Paul would not know what to do) in the actual state of things.<a name=149:141></a> God always knows what to do, because He is above all.<a name=149:142></a> He will judge at the end.<a name=149:143></a> He will cause His grace to shine forth by translating into the glory those who are faithful in the confusion; but the creative energies of a perfect order are not suited to the confusion and moral culpability which result from having spoiled that order.<a name=149:144></a> It would be to dishonour that fresh light of a new affection of which Christ is the centre and object.<a name=149:145></a> Christ Himself begins with -- "Blessed, blessed;" it was natural that this should come forth from the heart of Him who came from heaven; but He ends with "Woe unto you, woe unto you.<a name=149:146></a>" Was it that His grace had diminished?<a name=149:147></a> No indeed, it had but been tested, approved more glorious, His unfailing faithfulness more than ever assured to our hearts.<a name=149:148></a> But He could not be at the end what He was at the beginning.<a name=149:149></a> It is the same with the work.<a name=149:150></a> But, the love and blessedness of the one who understands this grace are greater than before.<a name=149:151></a> Paul, in the Epistle to the Philippians, is more matured, knows himself more profoundly in Christ, than when in all the energies by which he confounded his adversaries.<a name=149:152></a> His experience of Christ is more complete, and his heart thus more perfect in its feelings.<a name=149:153></a> Elias can be compared with Moses, for they were together the companions in glory of the Saviour on the Mount; but Elias, in presence of the golden calves, could not make a tabernacle as Moses did.<a name=149:154></a> He was, for that very reason, a still more striking witness of the grace of God.<a name=149:155></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One more remark about Madame de Krdener, without doubt less important, but that I believe to be true.<a name=149:156></a> There was with her a lack of spiritual originality, not of sincerity; this serious defect betrays itself also in her work, and, among other things, has given it its character.<a name=149:157></a> She received impressions from Jung Stilling, from Oberlin, from Tersteegen, from Maria Kummrin.<a name=149:158></a> Perhaps this was natural in a woman, but that is why a woman cannot be a principal agent in the work.<a name=149:159></a> It is foreign to the ways of God.<a name=149:160></a> She may help, greatly help, but not be a principal agent; she may do things a man could not do, but not do what he does.<a name=149:161></a> This is true in a more important point of view.<a name=149:162></a> She could not receive directly from Christ, impulsion for a position which He did not give her.<a name=149:163></a> The love of Christ was there; the impulsion came from elsewhere.<a name=149:164></a> Now, when it is Christ Himself who sets the heart in motion, He acts upon the new man, as He also forms in us that new man which the wicked one touches not.<a name=149:165></a> His presence acts upon the conscience, silences the flesh, reduces the man to nothing -- his vanity, his self-love, and his good opinion of himself; the whole man is judged in His presence, and the work produced is of Christ Himself, whatever may be the vessel.<a name=149:166></a> If there is danger of its being otherwise, a thorn in the flesh is sent.<a name=149:167></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When we receive our impressions, our impulsions second hand, the flesh and the heart are not judged at all, although the love of Christ may be in us.<a name=149:168></a> The flesh and the heart are reproduced anew, and the agent is exposed, by the very fact of his activity, to all sorts of snares of the enemy, which, on their part again, are reproduced in the work.<a name=149:169></a> This was the case with Madame de Krdener; but she certainly will not lose the fruit of her devotedness, of which I do not in the least, for my own part, doubt the sincerity.<a name=149:170></a> But there was too much of man with her, and man is always false.<a name=149:171></a> This is so true (it is important to notice it) that, while tasting the love of Christ, she never really knew the gospel, as being herself in the presence of God, until her last illness; and then she immediately perceived that she had often mistaken her imagination for the voice of God; for it is only there that man dies, and that God is seen alone, such as He is.<a name=149:172></a> Now as long as man is not dead, Satan can make use of him, and spiritual discernment is wanting.<a name=149:173></a> The fact of the accomplishment of the visions proves nothing in these things.<a name=149:174></a> All that also accompanies the power of the enemy; but the spiritual man, being humble, easily judges these things when God places him before them, and when he takes the word of God as the absolute guide of his judgment.<a name=149:175></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These, you will say, are remarks on Madame de Krdener, and not on my work; except a few words of blame, you have said nothing about it: this is a poor compliment.<a name=149:176></a> You are mistaken.<a name=149:177></a> Compliments, it is true, I do not make; but the best, the true praise of a work is, that it produces thoughts in him who reads it, and such has been the effect of your work.<a name=149:178></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have pointed out to you the defect, which has appeared to me to spoil it a little; then, from the point of view of the book itself, I believe it unimprovable except the letter of M.<a name=149:179></a> de Frgeville; for I do not think that at this moment you could place yourself in the presence of Christ, to relate the things and present them from the point of view that you have done in this work.<a name=149:180></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In our state of imperfection, every moral position has its own season; where, instead of starting clear from the perfection and riches of Christ, we work ordinarily in purifying ourselves, and reproduce ourselves, alas, in our work, while thinking to judge everything.<a name=149:181></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the life of Madame de Krdener, it would be important to know what formed her habitual reading; it betrays itself sometimes.<a name=149:182></a> Oberlin may be recognised.<a name=149:183></a> He was a devoted man, but with an unbridled imagination, a noted heretic, whose error bear their fruits now, when what man, and even the church admire, is lost and forgotten; for the judgment of God is not that of man.<a name=149:184></a> Tersteegen also may be recognised: I do not know if one could trace any others; but this would be one element of that which formed Madame de Krdener's public character.<a name=149:185></a> It is well, in order not to feed the vain curiosity of the public, that your volumes contain so little of the views which acted so powerfully upon her life; yet in order to judge healthily of it, we should need to know a little more .<a name=149:186></a>.<a name=149:187></a>.<a name=149:188></a> .<a name=149:189></a>

		[E Maylan] [From the French.<a name=158:1></a>] VERY DEAR BROTHER, -- It is indeed the force of Ephesians 4 that you particularly point out, but you must not forget to what the church is destined in the age to come and for ever, when there will be there no power to counter-balance, as in 1: 11-12, 2: 7, 5: 27, etc.<a name=158:2></a> -- our own relationships with the Lord; but what you say is truly what ought to be at the present time, and it is this which has failed so sadly.<a name=158:3></a> Alas, my heart is always most painfully affected by it; but we await His glory.<a name=158:4></a> We must remember that priesthood does not apply to the church as seen in Christ, but to individuals such as they are in fact; and it maintains the relations of such beings with, or in a position such as, that of the church seen in Christ; that is to say, perfect, leaving out of count that which is down here in it.<a name=158:5></a> Here may come in the idea that applies to every thought of God, with regard to that which is down here, that is to say, as having sentiments, movements of heart, etc.<a name=158:6></a>, in view of what is passing; and in a certain sense the expression of it is human, but it is the imperfect expression of a reality.<a name=158:7></a> Priesthood does not touch the question of our perfection, save that that perfection has placed us in a heavenly position before God in Christ, in regard to which it is a question of maintaining poor feeble creatures on the earth.<a name=158:8></a> Sometimes the idea of our heavenly perfection in Christ obscures the thought of priesthood; for me it is the basis of it.<a name=158:9></a> Is it your thought; or only that that which is done necessarily and perfectly in heaven is presented as a function which is in exercise?<a name=158:10></a> The word of God speaks in fact as to children, but it is in order that that which is true may thus be within the reach of children.<a name=158:11></a>

		As to my movements, dear brother, I am more than ever ignorant; I have just had a short but very severe illness.<a name=158:12></a> I had an attack in my head by the hand of God, in such a manner as to cut the thread of my moral life; of what will result from it for my career I know little.<a name=158:13></a> I was habitually throughout that illness in deep peace, which has done me good, but it has greatly separated me from the course of my ordinary life, and I do not know when that will be resumed.<a name=158:14></a> I am better, but I do not yet apply my head in an orderly way.<a name=158:15></a> The mountain would do me good, but there are two accounts on which it is possible that God will raise up work to me, and until I set to work I can hardly say.<a name=158:16></a> Also I am very poor for travelling at this moment, but I will write you a line, God willing; but I should like you, beloved brother, to develop a little your thought as to priesthood.<a name=158:17></a>

		I do not doubt that there is a divine manner of seeing, which differs from the communications made to us who understand but in part, but the communication that is made to us is divinely suited to produce in us, as far as that can be according to our finite capacity, the effect and idea of the reality of that which is seen divinely above, so that it is the truth as far as we are capable of it, the truth for us.<a name=158:18></a> Nothing else would be expressed: otherwise in its elevation we should understand nothing; in a lower way the height of the divine thought would not be expressed.<a name=158:19></a> It is like Christ Himself, God manifest in flesh; God, but within reach of man, always such that He could say, "He that hath seen me hath seen the Father" -- so with divine communications.<a name=158:20></a> I do not know if this is your thought, tell me in one word.<a name=158:21></a> I have not F.<a name=158:22></a>'s address, otherwise I should have written to him.<a name=158:23></a> Tell him there are many things to cause joy in the winnowing, though one may be feeble in it.<a name=158:24></a>

		[E Maylan] [To the same.<a name=160:1></a>] [From the French.<a name=160:2></a>] VERY DEAR BROTHER, -- It seems to me that what you present as the thought of the Epistle to the Ephesians, is one of the most striking, but it is not particularly that of chapter 4.<a name=160:3></a> There is yet another very important one, namely, that Christ, and the church by Him and united to Him, will have dominion over all things, all the works of God, in blessing, when Satan is outside the scene.<a name=160:4></a> In this is the difference on this point, between this dispensation and that which is to come.<a name=160:5></a> During this one, by the power of the Holy Spirit we glorify the Lord (at least, we ought to do it) in presence of the evil, and in spite of its power; whereas, in the age to come, the Lord will have set aside the power of evil by the exercise of His own in judgment, and will govern creation in blessing according to the power of the Lord to do what is good.<a name=160:6></a> Only fallen man will be still in his weakness, and one will learn to distinguish better that which is of him and of the enemy; and man will be left without excuse when after all he falls, as soon as the enemy is let loose.<a name=160:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But this recalls to mind another part of the Epistle, that is to say, the intimate relationship between the church and Christ Himself, its internal relationships without regard to its relations with that which is apart from Christ; and this positive relationship is that which is most intimate of all and precious.<a name=160:8></a> This procures for us also His continual care that we may be a bride suited to Him, then that He may present it to Himself formed morally by the word, and then glorified by the powerful hand of Him who is its Head without spot and without wrinkle.<a name=160:9></a> We must not forget either the important accessory truth of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, not only as seal of the individual, but to form the body and animate its members.<a name=160:10></a> It is also remarkable that in the midst of all this, the Spirit of God makes the exhortations the occasion of introducing our position of dear children before Cod, that we may imitate Him.<a name=160:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not quite know what you mean at the end of your letter, unless it is that priesthood is a way of expressing that we are perfect in Christ.<a name=160:12></a> But if that is the thought, I do not believe it is right, dear brother; because if it is important for us to consider ourselves perfect in Christ as the starting-point, whether of confidence or of nearness to God, so that all may be judged in us and around us according to that nearness, the discovery of that which we are in fact in view of that, the needs that flow from it for our souls, for our hearts, give place to the obtaining of necessary grace by the intervention of Jesus; and all that happens with regard to these needs brings into play, produces even, affections, interest, light and tenderness of conscience, spiritual discernment, growth of our moral being, which bring us constantly nearer in fact to the light, in which we are by right in virtue of the perfection of Him who, having borne our sins, is before God according to the absolute perfection in man of that which answers to all the exigencies and to all the affections of the moral being of God Himself.<a name=160:13></a> And it is not enough to be there of right on account of Christ, it is a question of being there in fact according to the love of Him who has introduced us there.<a name=160:14></a> Now the failures and weaknesses which would place us at a distance from it, become by the intercession of Jesus so many means of understanding, and links with the love of Him who answers to it, and channels of the intelligence of what He is, and of what He desires, so that we are formed intelligently after His image.<a name=160:15></a> Without the presence of Christ in heaven for us, this would not be so; it is He who puts us in relationship with God, and maintains the communications of imperfect beings with the Being who is perfect; and He makes our imperfections the occasion of the communication of His grace, and that by working in our affections by His Spirit, thus placing us in known relationships, consciously enjoyed and righteous.<a name=160:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But explain to me more clearly, dear brother, your thought.<a name=160:17></a> I should much like to know it.<a name=160:18></a> Two reasons have hindered me from coming; I was taken ill at the mountain, after one of the happiest journeys in the Basses Pyrnes, where I felt the Spirit was working very sensibly.<a name=160:19></a> The attack was in my head.<a name=160:20></a> I could do nothing for three weeks: I am better .<a name=160:21></a>.<a name=160:22></a>.<a name=160:23></a> .<a name=160:24></a> Then there is the printing of my "tudes sur le Pentateuque.<a name=160:25></a>" Salute the brethren warmly.<a name=160:26></a> I always hope to see them.<a name=160:27></a> Perhaps I must go to England.<a name=160:28></a>

		MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I was purposing writing to you when your note arrived.<a name=162:1></a> I have heard that the flesh manifested itself in the circumstances attending the leaving Orchard Street; as also it was stirred up by the way they were dealt with.<a name=162:2></a> I write to you to say that if this has been so -- into which I do not inquire -- I justify it in no way; I leave it to the Lord's judgment.<a name=162:3></a> I go upon the broad ground that I get for myself -- brethren avowedly clear of all upholding of Bethesda -- without to me any other question.<a name=162:4></a> I stated in my circular I should not go where persons were received from Bethesda.<a name=162:5></a> Bethesda received those who had been rejected as the avowed associates of Mr.<a name=162:6></a> Newton, thus forcing us too, if we owned Bethesda, to receive them back again.<a name=162:7></a> After what I stated yesterday, I have nothing to add.<a name=162:8></a> I can conceive no more miserable effort to serve the doctrine than the document still upheld by Bethesda.<a name=162:9></a> As to people's consciences, you must allow me to respect my own as well as others'; and, if others are determined to uphold what I believe to be wickedness, not to walk with them; if others judge so too, how can I condemn them?<a name=162:10></a> I have since I left Ebrington Street asked for the fellowship of none, except they felt disposed to receive me as having taken my position.<a name=162:11></a> I think Bethesda's position a very wicked one, and I think upholding it is wickedness, though ignorance about it may not be.<a name=162:12></a> The question of doctrine is not the question with Bethesda, but that of their trying to screen those who held it, and thus to force neutrality upon others.<a name=162:13></a> That they will not do with me.<a name=162:14></a> They have taken their position, and I have taken mine; and I shall act as to all so as to make it as clear as possible.<a name=162:15></a> But I am not now going to take any part in what is going on: I feel sure I have the Lord with me; time will shew.<a name=162:16></a> I think your position a false one.<a name=162:17></a> I do not pretend to judge how others may have wounded your sensibilities, for I really do not know.<a name=162:18></a> I pronounce no judgment whatever on the acts of persons in my absence.<a name=162:19></a> It is very probable I might not have agreed in them, as I felt the Lord was acting, and that the truest way was to leave Bethesda and its associates alone, and that they were in the Lord's hands.<a name=162:20></a> But I was not the judge of what others did.<a name=162:21></a> I desire earnestly that you may be brought in peace and brotherly unity out of a position I believe to be false.<a name=162:22></a> I have sorrows, but no difficulty.<a name=162:23></a> I can wait upon others, and I do so, but I cannot willingly make my position equivocal.<a name=162:24></a> I go on very broad plain ground.<a name=162:25></a> I think Bethesda very bad.<a name=162:26></a> I cannot own it as if it was not.<a name=162:27></a> I believe it has been publicly and avowedly unfaithful to Christ; hence that its supporters are upon terrible ground: that suffices to guide my conduct.<a name=162:28></a> In dealing with others I shall endeavour to do so according to the grace and truth that is in the Lord Jesus.<a name=162:29></a> Such a position is very simple and makes the path very plain, if one only knows how to walk in it.<a name=162:30></a> There has been division where there have been supporters and justifiers of Bethesda, but where the guilt lies in that case the Lord will judge; I am not aware, unless a very few individuals, that there has been, where there has been faithful firmness.<a name=162:31></a>

		[Mons.<a name=163:1></a> Eynard] [From the French.<a name=163:2></a>] VERY DEAR BROTHER, -- You are entering I think upon that period of activity which makes a life of reflection a far more hidden life than before.<a name=163:3></a> This is a very real advance in christian life.<a name=163:4></a> I liked divine philosophy, it is still to my taste.<a name=163:5></a> As long as the external life is composed of this, we have the appearance of being far more spiritual and deep.<a name=163:6></a> Thus, the steam which escapes from the engine, appears to have much more force than that which draws the heavy train, which only appears to offer resistance to the movement that it is sought to give it; but it is when hidden for the most part, that the force really acts.<a name=163:7></a> In this way its reality also is put to the proof.<a name=163:8></a> And why do I say that it is real progress?<a name=163:9></a> It is because it makes less appearance before men, because it is more entirely before God, with whose approval we must be satisfied.<a name=163:10></a> We must be content to possess the thing with Him, nay -- to find it in Him; but that is to possess it in reality.<a name=163:11></a> It is the principle of moral perfection, to enjoy things instead of accrediting oneself with them in the eyes of others.<a name=163:12></a> Active christian life is a common life of service, in contact with human passions, faults, and weaknesses, in a word, in contact with the flesh.<a name=163:13></a> But to act in it, to introduce God in it, and this is what Christ was, there must be power, we must be really in communion with Him -- participating thus in that nature that nothing encroaches on, and which shines in its own perfection in the midst of all -- to be above all that we meet with.<a name=163:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Divine philosophy, supposing it to be real, and to meet with no opposition when displayed before others, is an easy enjoyment, and, as I have said, one clothes oneself with it, one displays it to admiring eyes.<a name=163:15></a> To walk in christian life, we must be what we admire: that is another thing.<a name=163:16></a> We must be divine, in the sense of the communion of His nature.<a name=163:17></a> And this is why Jesus was the most isolated of men, and, at the same time, the most accessible, the most affable: the most isolated, because He lived in absolute communion with His Father, and found no echo, no sympathy with the perfect love which was in Him; the most accessible, the most affable, because He was that love for others.<a name=163:18></a> Speaking of the ineffable work which opened a way for that love through all the sin, He says: "I have a baptism to be baptised with; and how am I straitened until it is accomplished.<a name=163:19></a>" That baptism of bitterness and death, which made an end of sin, even in its last stronghold and its last title of destruction, through the righteousness of God against us, gave free course to that love in its infinite designs of grace; for love is of infinite invention for the happiness of that which is loved, and the love of God purposes that which is beyond all our thoughts.<a name=163:20></a> It is the spring of the thoughts of the infinite God.<a name=163:21></a> And again, when towards the end of His course the opportunity presents itself, at the moment when the unbelief of <i>His own</i> makes Him say, "How long shall I be with you?<a name=163:22></a> and suffer you?<a name=163:23></a>" (for -- and this is what He expects from us in this poor world -- there was not, even in His own, faith or capacity to make use of the resources of grace and power which were in Him) He adds, without even a moment's interval, "Bring thy son hither.<a name=163:24></a>" (Luke 9: 41.<a name=163:25></a>) The consciousness of being isolated in His love, so that others did not even understand how to profit by it, does not, for a moment, arrest His energy and activity.<a name=163:26></a> The same sentence which contains the "how long," says also "bring thy son hither.<a name=163:27></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What was then the life of this Jesus, the Man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief?<a name=163:28></a> A life of activity in obscurity, causing the love of God to penetrate the most hidden corners of society, wherever needs were greatest; among those whom human pride repelled, in order to maintain its own reputation, but whom the love of God sought, because He needed not to establish for Himself a reputation, or to keep one.<a name=163:29></a> He was always the same: and the more He apparently compromised Himself, the more He manifested Himself in a perfection which never belied itself.<a name=163:30></a> The love of God needed not, like human society, to protect itself from that which laid it too bare.<a name=163:31></a> It was always itself.<a name=163:32></a> The toilsome life of Jesus was passed in seeking souls in all circumstances.<a name=163:33></a> It went through everything that could put it to the proof, but we see in it a divine reality which never failed; then -- in presence of self-righteousness and pride, and the tyrannical boldness of the contradiction of sinners, or in favour of some poor crushed soul, or, lastly, to justify the ways of God in their favour -- we discover in it from time to time a divine mine of touching, exquisite thoughts, a depth of truth which betrayed its perfection by its simplicity, shewing a soul always fed with the most intimate communion with infinite love and perfect holiness; the One who could say, "We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen;" who weighed evil by the perfection of good which was in Him, and found, in the fearful discoveries (if we speak of discoveries where all was open) which the holiness of His soul made, opportunities for the manifestation of infinite love -- or rather, it was the love of a holy Being which made these discoveries, a love which clothed itself with a grace which, by its very humiliation, placed itself within the reach of all the needs of the heart, and which, at the same time, in presence of the pride of man, shewed itself at the height of the dignity and majesty of God.<a name=163:34></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How beautiful to see this Person (these divine qualities piercing through the humiliation) place Himself within the reach of those whom the world despised, and find -- being wearied with His journey, indebted for a drink of water to a woman who scarcely dare shew herself with others -- meat to eat which the world, and even His disciples, knew nothing of; and that, in the deliverance of a poor heart crushed by the weight of a bad conscience and the contempt of her fellow creatures, to whom He had given back (or rather, given) the spring of life and joy.<a name=163:35></a> What a prospect!<a name=163:36></a> how much of blessing to sinners this opened to His soul; for He did not disdain such consolation in the midst of a world which drove Him from its bosom.<a name=163:37></a> Thus love consoles itself: the heart that loves the sinner needs it in such a world.<a name=163:38></a> But where is this to be found?<a name=163:39></a> In retirement, in the labours of a life which had to do with the common needs of soul, but as abiding in the truth; for this life did not shelter itself from the misery of the world, to walk in the midst of that which has an appearance only, but it brought into it -- precious grace!<a name=163:40></a> -- the love of God.<a name=163:41></a> He was that which others could write of.<a name=163:42></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How many needs, hidden even in the most degraded souls, would confess themselves, would come to light, if a love, a goodness which could give them confidence, were presented to them: but for this, one must be content, often to find oneself in the midst of such degradation, being preserved from it only by what is within; and this was the life of the Lord.<a name=163:43></a> How many souls are whirling in pleasure, in order to silence the moral griefs which torment them!<a name=163:44></a> Divine love not only answers needs; it makes them speak.<a name=163:45></a> It is delightful to see the opening out of a soul, and, at the same time, to see the entrance of spiritual intelligence.<a name=163:46></a> One may not exactly seek the degradation I speak of, but we find the world knowing that is the truth as to what is found there, and its external forms do not rebuff the soul.<a name=163:47></a> But it is a life of labour, of patience and of happiness, the like of which cannot be found.<a name=163:48></a> Christ could say through all, "That they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves.<a name=163:49></a>" Without doubt there are diversities of gifts, but even when God opens this path before us in His grace, how slow we are to follow the track of the One who draws us there!<a name=163:50></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Courage, dear brother!<a name=163:51></a> grace is there in the path which He has opened to us; we find it every day as we go along; and what glory, when all the principles which have been formed in the heart by faith, blossom in heaven, and are reproduced in the fulness of their results, according to the heart of God.<a name=163:52></a> We must wait while walking by faith.<a name=163:53></a> But I must stop.<a name=163:54></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am at -- , where I am pursuing a very humble work, a work of detail, but a work in which I am very happy, feeling I am at my post, and even with little desire to leave it.<a name=163:55></a> God in His great goodness refreshes me a little, when I see souls refreshed and happy in the thought of His precious and perfect grace.<a name=163:56></a> It is a little work, but I see in it the good hand of God, who in spite of our weakness makes us feel a little how good it is to be with Him .<a name=163:57></a>.<a name=163:58></a>.<a name=163:59></a> .<a name=163:60></a>

		[E Maylan] [<i>From the French</i>.<a name=167:1></a>] VERY DEAR BROTHER, -- You will be rather surprised at receiving an answer to your letter now, but not, I am sure, sorry.<a name=167:2></a> As to Ephesians 4, we must remember that it does not treat of ornaments before the world, but the tender and precious care of Christ for that which He loves as His own flesh.<a name=167:3></a> In result, man cannot frustrate this care; he may know very little how to profit by it; the intelligent result down here may be but small, but the thought of God in blessing will be always accomplished, because our folly, though culpable, gives room for His wisdom.<a name=167:4></a> If Israel had not courage to go up the mountain of the Amorites, and as to present circumstances lost, and lost what they did not find again, they learned -- at least, Joshua and Caleb and others, and we ourselves likewise -- much as to themselves, which set them in a relationship much more real, more true with God, according to what Israel was, and what God was, and gave God an opportunity for the display of His grace and power, taking care of even the nap of their coats, and not allowing their feet to swell; for a manifestation much more remarkable of His power and of His ways in the crossing of Jordan dryshod, and in all the details of their entrance into Canaan, from the testimony of Balaam after the long passage of the desert -- all these things being necessary to the full revelation of the ways and counsels of God.<a name=167:5></a> Was it then that the sin of Israel was the work of God?<a name=167:6></a> By no means.<a name=167:7></a> This unbelief was already in their heart; the arrival at the mountain was but the opportunity for its manifestation.<a name=167:8></a> God may permit and arrange events for the manifestation of sin -- never in order to produce it -- and the manifestation (being under grace) brings all into the light, and is a means of progress.<a name=167:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then to say that because the church has failed it gets necessarily into a worse condition, is true and false at the same time.<a name=167:10></a> As a public vessel of testimony to the truth on the earth, to its shame, that is true; but it is impossible that God or Christ should be unfaithful, and the fact of the manifest and general failure, gives room for a concentration of energy and of light, so much the brighter, as the space it illumines is small.<a name=167:11></a> Israel, when the precious Saviour was there, was always going on worse, was tending to its ruin, but He shines with a light ever brighter, as it is concentrated in what He was Himself, instead of lending itself to His relations, true but temporary and obligatory with the Jews.<a name=167:12></a> This is the reason why, though all is so beautiful, the Lord appears in John with a light and perfection infinitely more touching and striking -- why we see Him better than in the other gospels.<a name=167:13></a> We are more entirely with Him, with Him alone, with what He was in Himself.<a name=167:14></a> There the Jews are set aside.<a name=167:15></a> Who in the history of Israel shines in the midst of darkness like Elijah?<a name=167:16></a> the only one in testimony, the only one -- save the hidden remnant, whom the eye of God recognised and whom the faith of the prophet ought to have known, if he had been near enough to God to have His thoughts.<a name=167:17></a> I find in the Psalms, that faith is much more simple and calm when the remnant is driven away.<a name=167:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is the same, I believe, with the church, at least, one may look for it; not that the vessel should be repaired, and set right, but that the true church, those at least who in heart are waiting for the Lord, will be always more true in their position, will understand the Lord's heart better, will be more united amongst themselves, a "little flock," but who will know much better the voice and the heart and the thoughts of the Good Shepherd.<a name=167:19></a> The ground which the enemy gains can only be over the flesh and over the general testimony: it is sad, but understood by the faithful one, and, after Sardis, the manifest general condition.<a name=167:20></a> If I find Laodicea to be spued out, I find Philadelphia, which has the ear and heart of the Saviour, having little strength, but which has kept His word, and not denied His name.<a name=167:21></a> We are working for the most part with those, the half of whom do not know the immense principles in question; but if there is faithfulness, a single eye, God keeps them.<a name=167:22></a> But to be always waiting for the Lord, that is our strength.<a name=167:23></a> "There are many called, but few chosen.<a name=167:24></a>" Alas!<a name=167:25></a> decline is the continual tendency, but the Saviour never declines.<a name=167:26></a> Keeping close to Him, one will have, not perhaps a public testimony common to the masses -- they are always rather the fruit of a testimony -- but still, the testimony on His part in the fulness of His power, according to the need of the church; for His power and His love never change.<a name=167:27></a> This is a subject that goes to the heart, and I know that I can trust Him, though I have been often cast down at the sight of the determination of the church to put aside grace and blessing, and the power which the enemy puts forth in deceiving her.<a name=167:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have lost time at Montpellier, through failing to follow sufficiently closely the leadings of the Holy Ghost, and I am suffering for it now, having to do through greater difficulty that which, having been done much more easily before, would have left me free to do what I cannot now accomplish as I should desire, but now I put myself again in His loving hands; I must learn my lesson of the mountain and the Jordan.<a name=167:29></a> We are in sorrowful times; let us not be surprised at it, only let us be near Him, in order to make shine clearly, without obscuring it, what He gives.<a name=167:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the second question, it is certain that the day of atonement applied to the conscience in the sense of acceptance before God for all sins until the end.<a name=167:31></a> Man, such as he is altogether, is, so to speak, set aside, and Christ, in the efficacy of His work, put in his place before God, and the Christian ought always to have the consciousness of it, never to have the thought that God is against him.<a name=167:32></a> He is not so; Christ has borne all his sins; it is impossible that they should be imputed to him, impossible that he can be too clear about it.<a name=167:33></a> My sins are committed in an existing relationship, and one which they do not alter, but they are much more serious on that account.<a name=167:34></a> But my relations with God are realities, for which according to His glory I have been saved and washed, and these relations are really interrupted by sin.<a name=167:35></a> The blood of the red heifer was not put upon the mercy-seat, but it was sprinkled seven times before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, where God met with the people; this secured even at all times the basis of their intercourse.<a name=167:36></a> Restoration was on the side of him who had defiled himself, and it was a real restoration.<a name=167:37></a> The nature of God is against sin, and darkness could not have communion with light, but our condition is darkness if we have touched death.<a name=167:38></a> There is a difference when the Holy Ghost reveals God in my heart, and I am in the atmosphere of His love, and when I search for and endeavour to find the sense of His presence; it is not a question of presenting the man, but of his condition if he were presented.<a name=167:39></a> Now the Spirit of God gives us the consciousness of this condition in grace, but in the conscience and in the heart.<a name=167:40></a> He renews in the heart the consciousness of the relationship; in the conscience, the feeling of having failed in it, and this in presence of the perfect love of Christ, for the ashes of the heifer are the proof of His love, and that sin is taken away -- has been taken away, rather -- that it is not a question of imputation, but of the work in itself.<a name=167:41></a> It is the word which is the instrument of it, the truth, and the word is this truth.<a name=167:42></a> As to imputation, it is then no longer a question; but defilement is not imputation.<a name=167:43></a> Now what Christ is doing for us in heaven is to reconcile practically our present position in fact here below with our position acquired in Him, and to make good to us, being in His presence as to our personal acceptance, all the grace of God to maintain us at the height of the enjoyment of this position, or to make us rise to it in the practical sense.<a name=167:44></a> Therefore it is said, "for such an high priest became us, holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens," because it is a question of this position for us, and He must be there.<a name=167:45></a> Now it is necessary to sympathise with our infirmities, but He "was tempted in all things like as we, without sin.<a name=167:46></a>" Aaron was in infirmity when he was exercising the priesthood; not Christ, because we have a place with Him in heaven, but He knew what temptation was when He was here, and in virtue of His presence in heaven (in which we are accepted, nothing being imputed), He obtains all that is necessary to put us into real relations with our position above, or rather with God according to that position.<a name=167:47></a> So there is no inconsistency between the sense of having our position unimpaired, and the deepest feelings of horror of sin; on the contrary, it is by having this conviction that the feeling is produced.<a name=167:48></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In our ministry we must put these things in connection; this is what the ashes of the heifer did.<a name=167:49></a> In John 13, he who <i>is washed</i> needs only that his feet should be washed, but <i>he is wholly clean</i>.<a name=167:50></a> I do not put myself back into it when I have sinned; I do not lose it.<a name=167:51></a> It is because the house is clean, that I have a horror of the dirt that I have brought into it.<a name=167:52></a> If one has lost the sense of the purity of the house, one takes less account of the dirt, but the flesh can cast itself on that.<a name=167:53></a> When one has sinned, it is not that any longer; being there fully in the light, with full confidence, one's heart is cast on the judgment of what is inconsistent with such a position, and the love even unto death which has placed us there.<a name=167:54></a> The priesthood of Christ is exercised in order to produce right feelings, not when we have them.<a name=167:55></a> It is not our relief to think of it when we have failed, save as a general truth.<a name=167:56></a> "If any one sin" (not if any one repent), "we have an advocate with the Father.<a name=167:57></a>" It is not (appropriately) said, Melchisedec, king of righteousness, save as to His person, except within the veil.<a name=167:58></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have given you a few thoughts; I do not know if they answer to your request.<a name=167:59></a> I write a little in haste, even after such a long delay.<a name=167:60></a> There is some little good in the south, but weak in comparison with the organisation which is got up to hinder souls from finding their true position.<a name=167:61></a>

		DEAREST -- , -- Thank you much for your letter, which I need not say interested me much.<a name=171:1></a> Still, I feel, though my heart often in England, my path is for the moment shut up here.<a name=171:2></a> When I say, shut up, it is not complaint, for I have everything to bless God for, and that my path for Him is to abide quietly for the moment.<a name=171:3></a> Switzerland will certainly require a visit before I return to England.<a name=171:4></a> But I have felt through much weakness, the Lord blessing my soul, and I feel it is good to cultivate this; even in going to Montpellier, I feel that I rather dissipate myself, though there is some good there.<a name=171:5></a> The Lord has an intimate government of the soul which is infinite in love, but which one has to heed if one would have His face with one.<a name=171:6></a> At times one may have merely to go straightforward in the energy of His grace for others, and there is joy in service without much thought of self; at other times He leads in the way of exercise for our own good.<a name=171:7></a> We are here in a very little humble scale, and plentifully despised and opposed and spoken against by all of influence, but there is some blessing.<a name=171:8></a> Yesterday week in the morning, I think four at least got a clear view of the gospel and work of Christ.<a name=171:9></a> Yesterday I felt much less power.<a name=171:10></a> But it is a place where without positive power, there is nothing to do at all.<a name=171:11></a> This is necessarily in consequence a real trial for the soul .<a name=171:12></a>.<a name=171:13></a>.<a name=171:14></a> .<a name=171:15></a> But I have no uneasiness; I am satisfied God is in the storm (whatever instrumentality of Satan there may have been), and I have no doubt (whatever defects and want of faith there may have been), we, those who hold fast the beginning of our confidence, are in the same boat with Christ.<a name=171:16></a> Hence I can leave it all in peace till God clears me my way into the midst of the conflict, exercised, but at peace.<a name=171:17></a> But unless it is brought to me, I remain outside, because I am satisfied that is faith.<a name=171:18></a> I thank the brethren much for their prayers; I feel I am a poor workman, and my work is so negative just now, that there is little to say about it.<a name=171:19></a> But it holds the ground where reproach only was before, and carried the testimony of how good the gospel is, into souls, though they have not courage to walk with them with whom they have found it.<a name=171:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I find in scripture more depth, it is more real, true in Christ, and therefore has more infinitude in its character than ever.<a name=171:21></a> I was much struck lately with the way in which Christ was answered and overcame in Gethsemane and on the cross.<a name=171:22></a> I apprehend, while looking forward to the dreadful cup, the proper and immediate trial of Gethsemane was the power of Satan.<a name=171:23></a> "This is your hour and the power of darkness" -- the great point was to get between His soul and the Father (as before, by desirable things for life).<a name=171:24></a> But he could not; Christ hence pleading with His Father, receiving nothing from Satan or man in the cup, receives it from His Father in perfect blessed obedience -- "Thou hast brought me into the dust of death.<a name=171:25></a>" Hence His soul is entirely out of the darkness in respect of His enemy, and He can say in perfect calm of others, "this is your hour and the power of darkness," and present Himself willingly that His disciples might go free.<a name=171:26></a> How blessed the perfectness which at His own cost always kept them free; for in their position Satan would have caught them in his hour had not the Lord stood in the gap -- and so ever -- and when needed for Peter, can allow just so much as was good to sift, but stay the proud billows for him which were to go clean over His own soul.<a name=171:27></a> He was then, I judge, entirely out of the whole conflict with darkness, before it came in fact.<a name=171:28></a> He passed through it with God, His God.<a name=171:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		At the cross, I apprehend it was another thing.<a name=171:30></a> He was forsaken of God, He had immediately to do with God and just wrath against sin, and He in that place, so that love could have no refuge for His soul; and here too He is perfect, and having accomplished this ineffable work, His soul having drunk the cup unmixed, atonement having been made, He comes forth from it as heard, and His act of death is merely His own giving up His spirit to His father: in the time of peace He had said so, but He was to pass through death in His soul, and did, as an offering for sin -- but then, what was death?<a name=171:31></a> It was one who had overcome death, undergone it in its infinite atoning efficacy, and who gives up His soul, more than pure, which had put away sin, into the hands of God His Father.<a name=171:32></a> What is death here, if the overcoming of Satan made it obedience?<a name=171:33></a> The bearing of wrath gave title to give up life into the merited reception of infinite favour.<a name=171:34></a> Death was His.<a name=171:35></a> It was not yet power in resurrection, but His soul given up to His Father.<a name=171:36></a> It was death, but death the closing of an accomplished life of obedience in woe, and the introduction into that infinite favour in life beyond all relationship of promise down here, which the work in which He had glorified the Father placed Him in; and so, through Him is death to us.<a name=171:37></a> It ceases to be a closing life; we have a title through Him to give up our souls in it into His hands as we see in Stephen; it is the closing of the conflict to be in the life in the power of which we live to Him -- absent from the body and present with the Lord.<a name=171:38></a> He gave Himself up -- it was power, though in reference to the Father, into whose hands He commends His spirit, that His resurrection might be by the glory of the Father.<a name=171:39></a> For in this even He did not take glory to Himself.<a name=171:40></a> Death, or what is called death, is thus a totally new thing; it is having done with all as a redeemed soul, to enter into another world.<a name=171:41></a> But I speak now of Christ.<a name=171:42></a> He had emerged from all this sorrow, far more dreadful hour, and could tell the thief he should come with Him into paradise, speak in peace to John of His mother -- His hour was come for this -- and knowing that all was accomplished, after saying, "I thirst," give up His own soul into His Father's hands.<a name=171:43></a> These two considerations have deeply affected me; save in some details, I never traced the general bearing and importance.<a name=171:44></a> I must close.<a name=171:45></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Though I sorrow over dear kind brethren like -- , I bless God with my whole heart that the brethren have been given to be faithful, and have proved themselves clear in this matter.<a name=171:46></a> Kind love to all.<a name=171:47></a>

		[<i>From the French</i>.<a name=174:1></a>] I have been thinking lately that the sufferings of Christ in Gethsemane, while anticipating the cross, were much more sufferings from Satan, who, with the power of death in his hand, sought to overwhelm Him with its darkness, so that the fear might be such that He should not offer Himself up.<a name=174:2></a> As man, He had overcome the enemy before, so as to be able to introduce blessing here below; but man was not fit for it.<a name=174:3></a> He had to establish this blessing by death in another sphere.<a name=174:4></a> Satan throws himself in His way to obstruct His path, but he could not succeed in preventing Him from finding God; being in the agony of the conflict, He prayed more earnestly.<a name=174:5></a> For Him the cup came from the hand of His Father.<a name=174:6></a> Once entirely out of all that, He offers Himself up.<a name=174:7></a> When it actually comes, He can speak of it, being no longer in it: "This is your hour, and the power of darkness.<a name=174:8></a>" Then He passes on to undergo another thing -- the direct wrath of God.<a name=174:9></a> He drank this terrible cup for us, dear brother; but He also came out of it completely, and Himself committed His soul in peace to God His Father, in the consciousness that all was accomplished.<a name=174:10></a> Death now but sets us free to go to Him in that new sphere, where He has for ever left behind the power of the enemy, and where there is nothing but blessing, far from the power of him who used it against Christ.<a name=174:11></a>

		I love -- dearly, but his idea of union, comeliness, worldly politeness, and so on, and I think an idea of a class of society, has dimmed his judgment; he is morally amphibious as to his springs of action; he loves the church, and knows there is one, and looks too for the Lord's coming as a present desire, but then he had muddled his judgment with journals, and Elliott, and such like, and he has set before himself an idea of something attainable here below for the church and for the individual, which must falsify the judgment.<a name=174:29></a> I always knew it acted on his imagination, but find it is a kind of settled principle or doctrine.<a name=174:30></a> But his idea of grace to individuals has made him inconsistent .<a name=174:31></a>.<a name=174:32></a>.<a name=174:33></a> .<a name=174:34></a> It is time to go on without thinking of people, in setting up the importance of the Lord Himself.<a name=174:35></a> If any have been personally hurt, amends may be personally made for that.<a name=174:36></a> What I felt unhappy about was that the matter had taken the character of a personal attack.<a name=174:37></a> Satan tried to give that character to my opposition in the affair of N.<a name=174:38></a>'s doctrine, but there was really no ground for it .<a name=174:39></a>.<a name=174:40></a>.<a name=174:41></a> .<a name=174:42></a> I am so convinced that it is morally beginning afresh, that I am not anxious about such or such a person, save in affection for them, or such and such a detail -- and further, that the sifting of God is a sifting of God for it.<a name=174:43></a>

		The need of union is felt.<a name=174:44></a> Of this there are two kinds, respectable courteous union among men, and the unity of the church of God.<a name=174:45></a> That is the true question .<a name=174:46></a>.<a name=174:47></a>.<a name=174:48></a> .<a name=174:49></a> There is the same question here, but it is everywhere tainted with the world.<a name=174:50></a> It is not of the Spirit of God, but a miserable effort of the enemy, to discredit the truth and faithfulness.<a name=174:51></a> While he could hold up the world in the shape of Nationalism, he did, and called us schism and separation.<a name=174:52></a> That no longer goes down with any; the truth has too much hold, and fears on the other side.<a name=174:53></a> Now then he sets up union as his cry -- namely, sacrifice Christ and the church, all true principle, to worldly civility, to let us go on our way without following Christ.<a name=174:54></a> But then there are many dear children of God in, and attracted by, the fair appearance of the snare of the enemy, and the personal part of the question tends to throw them into it.<a name=174:55></a> There is the whole matter as I see it, save personal questions.<a name=174:56></a>

		Here we, or at least I, am going through the fire of the strongest opposition; however, individual souls have received blessing, and I hold good for the present, though I am not sure how far it may issue in judgment for Nismes.<a name=174:57></a> In general there is some blessing on a small scale; the field of work vastly extended, but some little languor in working.<a name=174:58></a> The progress of the work however everywhere, has raised up every effort possible to work against and to do something, or that all will be carried away -- which is not so, for many love the world too much, and faith is not of all men .<a name=174:59></a>.<a name=174:60></a>.<a name=174:61></a> .<a name=174:62></a>

		[J E Batten] BELOVED BROTHER, -- I was on the move when I got your kind letter, so that I could not answer it at once, but I thank you much for it.<a name=182:1></a> It has not been my desire to interfere in matters in England, until I could do it seriously on the Lord's behalf, as called upon of Him to do it, and thus pursue it with the advised certainty of His calling as His service and obedience.<a name=182:2></a> It makes all the difference as to one's work, in certainty and effect too; indeed, nothing else is properly work.<a name=182:3></a> Save in two places (and in the second only with one person) where I was specially asked, I did not touch this question in England.<a name=182:4></a> I was in general very happy, always indeed, as to the course this matter is taking.<a name=182:5></a> Every prevision of God's working in it has taken place, and been surpassed considerably as to blessing.<a name=182:6></a> Individual souls have been exercised, and much more reality in Christ exists, without which all is nothing.<a name=182:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A mass of brethren had received blessed truths, superficially though really, and they were unconnected with an inward walk which associates the soul with Christ in them.<a name=182:8></a> The first wind blew much of this down; but where the inward state of the soul laid the ground for it, all this deepened exceedingly, and strengthened, and made to understand the relation between the soul and Christ in these things; and a large increase of real growth has been the consequence.<a name=182:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I blame myself as unfaithful in passing over many truths for the sake of what is called peace.<a name=182:10></a> And God took the matter in hand, and now I doubt not the ground of the truth which God is using will be far more deeply felt and understood, and a path according to it more intelligently pursued, by those who through grace have laid hold on it.<a name=182:11></a> This I thankfully believe God is doing.<a name=182:12></a> A humbling sifting was needed for it, but in gracious love and faithfulness, that He has sent us.<a name=182:13></a> It will put to the test whether Christ is preferred to brethren (even though loved), to ease, to everything; but this is blessed in fruit, because He will be everything, and thus links our souls to the time when He will be.<a name=182:14></a> I regret what was attempted at -- ; I regret what was done at -- .<a name=182:15></a>.<a name=182:16></a>.<a name=182:17></a> .<a name=182:18></a> But what was done at -- and -- does not affect me, because it was but a needed expression of what was to bring about the sifting.<a name=182:19></a> Hence I remained, and remain quiet.<a name=182:20></a> Where God is acting, it is useless for man to put in his hand.<a name=182:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not speak of fidelity when in the circumstances.<a name=182:22></a> My path is to consider it a settled question, and to go on in faithfulness in the truth, delivering according to what is given to me, when the case is presented to charity, as from any other evil, but to seek positive good.<a name=182:23></a> What is of the world will sink in, somewhere or other.<a name=182:24></a> What is not attached to Christ by the Holy Ghost, according to the needed truth by which He is now acting in and on His church, will fail in the conflict somewhere; but I act on the quiet conviction of entrusted truth, and the assurance that what does not receive it, cannot bear its fruits without agitation.<a name=182:25></a> Those who do not see what the church is, will not stand.<a name=182:26></a> But that is not the wickedness itself, but they will not be capable of holding good against it; and I act accordingly, or rather walk, acting only where called on.<a name=182:27></a> One may rest sometimes with God, as well as act with Him; for one cannot act without Him, save to trouble, even though meaning to do good.<a name=182:28></a> Along with stedfastness in testimony, the saints in general want building up in Christ, and also personal leaning on the grace of God towards them.<a name=182:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In general, abroad we have to be thankful.<a name=182:30></a> In France there is very much to be thankful for, and here in Switzerland they have been revived since winter.<a name=182:31></a> In Neuchtel there is positive blessing.<a name=182:32></a> I was in a part of France lately where I had not been before, in the Doubs (Montbliard), where the blessing is greater and more extensive than I at all even knew, though I knew there was such.<a name=182:33></a> They are walking in a good deal of simplicity and love (though Satan tried hard to make mischief in one place), with little public preaching help, and a good deal of dependence on the Lord.<a name=182:34></a> The world in general has the conviction, that if a man is converted he ought to be there.<a name=182:35></a> Save a very few, if any, Christians are there, and the world, as men say, "go to church," but unless one they are all poor.<a name=182:36></a> Query -- if the rich came, would they remain as simple?<a name=182:37></a> The gracious Lord that loves them, keeps them!<a name=182:38></a> What a mercy to be kept in the secret of His grace!<a name=182:39></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My feeling, and indeed conviction, is that there is decided progress, and that of God; His Spirit is working, though with needed (needed through the state of souls) slowness, in the godly discernment in conscience of what is right and wrong -- a coming to themselves in the saints.<a name=182:40></a> This is the only work of any account: this we must have or nothing; I decline all else as useless.<a name=182:41></a> Deputations, and going up to Bethesda, and all such like, are useless and worse, save as God uses everything (and in this I have full confidence), without denying that individuals may do it conscientiously according to the light they have.<a name=182:42></a> But it must come to a conscientious judgment in one's own conscience of evil by the Spirit of Christ, or nothing.<a name=182:43></a> And this will always be a humble, not a haughty thing.<a name=182:44></a> The rest we must leave behind or cast away.<a name=182:45></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My purpose is to come to England as soon as ever I can.<a name=182:46></a> I am bringing out the second volume of "tudes sur la Parole" -- the only definite thing which keeps me -- but paying any needed visit on the way.<a name=182:47></a> I purpose (D.<a name=182:48></a>V.<a name=182:49></a>) to come to England as soon as that is done.<a name=182:50></a> I ran over for a few weeks, finding I could not get to stay, and was very glad I did.<a name=182:51></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One great thing we have to seek is, that communion with Christ Himself be as strong as all the doctrines we hold or teach.<a name=182:52></a> Without that the doctrine itself will have no force: besides, we ourselves shall not be with God in it, and, after all, that is all.<a name=182:53></a> Peace be with you, dear brother, and much of this communion.<a name=182:54></a> It is easy for the life within to decline before the outward exercise of gift or activity does.<a name=182:55></a> I am sure the brethren want to be more exercised with Christ themselves.<a name=182:56></a> When the full truth God is using is not held and walked in, there cannot be community of service -- that is, where it is denied; for there may be ignorance of it.<a name=182:57></a> And further, what would be called the highest truth is the only safeguard against the principles of the worst error.<a name=182:58></a> If I am not one with Christ -- that is, if I depart from this -- I am ready to Judaize and worship angels.<a name=182:59></a> It is the easiest lost, because it requires the flesh to be mortified, and that living faith should be in exercise spiritually; and if lost, admits the worst errors.<a name=182:60></a> Farewell.<a name=182:61></a> Peace be with all the brethren.<a name=182:62></a>

		[J E Batten] [To the same.<a name=185:1></a>] I have a profound conviction that the question with God, and that in grace on His part, goes much deeper than the particular evil which gave occasion to the break up of Plymouth.<a name=185:2></a> I agree with all you say, but if it was the mere negation of evil, the case would be sad; because I have never found, though this be a bounden duty, that it sufficed to gather.<a name=185:3></a> I believe at my deliverance from bondage in 1827-8, God opened up certain truths needed for the church.<a name=185:4></a> I believe that, though holding and seeking to help souls by them, for what was called peace and union I swamped them, had not faith to make them good in service.<a name=185:5></a> I do not enter into all the questions how far it was permitted, or how far grace entered, or natural dislike of conflict, but so it was.<a name=185:6></a> God would not allow this; and what was founded on this unfaithfulness, associated with what was opposed, was broken up.<a name=185:7></a> I have no regret at this now, though the passage was painful.<a name=185:8></a> It is the grand reason why I have left the exercise to go on without interfering.<a name=185:9></a> It is no use attempting to daub with untempered mortar.<a name=185:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have, as you know, long said that for my part I begin again, that my proper work now begins.<a name=185:11></a> In saying this, I only confess my unfaithfulness, but on the other hand it is an encouragement, for to begin with God is always an encouragement.<a name=185:12></a> He has never lost time -- alas, we often.<a name=185:13></a> But I have faith in what I believe, only I feel it humbling even that God should be obliged (so to speak) to do so much outside what I am confident is His truth.<a name=185:14></a> It does not enough absorb the work.<a name=185:15></a> This, however, is true, that the truth now given by grace is not merely foundation or elementary, as at the Reformation, but while setting that again on its true basis, builds up and brings out that needed for the latter days -- that which was earliest, and always, is soonest lost -- "holding the Head from which all the body," etc.<a name=185:16></a> Hence people can content themselves with a certain Christianity which saves, which gives elementary truth, which has delivered from popish corruption and the like, without that which puts faith to the test.<a name=185:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the question will go, I do not doubt, on large grounds in England.<a name=185:18></a> It is the question which is now exercising it as to prophecy.<a name=185:19></a> This will require patience, for the great body have not the ground on which to judge these questions: they have not faith in the doctrine of the church.<a name=185:20></a> Now Ebrington Street brought down to its worst form, not ignorance, but opposition to this truth which is what God would have brought out, and -- as the corruption of what was best is the worse corruption -- was gone as far as possible.<a name=185:21></a> I doubt altogether that Raleigh Street has as its foundation anything solid which would hold it together as a whole.<a name=185:22></a> It is possible spiritual power might with patience have formed it into something consistent, but as a fact there was little common foundation truth on which it stood.<a name=185:23></a> Negations are nothing to build on, though conscience be a ground of conduct.<a name=185:24></a> This many have not understood; and because separation from evil may have been a duty, have supposed it to be a ground of union and gathering.<a name=185:25></a> It is not .<a name=185:26></a>.<a name=185:27></a>.<a name=185:28></a> .<a name=185:29></a> I should have been much disposed to begin afresh at -- , not as rejecting many dear brethren, far from it, but that they and I may enjoy together the refreshings of God's love in joy and peace: and this is a general principle with me.<a name=185:30></a> Perhaps continuance at -- might have got it on this ground, but across many wearisome difficulties.<a name=185:31></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the judgment they form of my separation and all the rest, even supposing there might be mistakes, I am more indifferent than as to the form of the paper I am writing on: because they have no perception at all, I am satisfied, either of the principles on which I acted, or on which God has dealt, or on which He would have us to act.<a name=185:32></a> The only point on which I have ever questioned whether I might have acted better or more wisely, they know nothing about, nor any one else.<a name=185:33></a> I bless God for it now, though that does not justify me, for I do not think I knew, or in a certain sense ought to have known, the evil of Ebrington Street the least as I know it now.<a name=185:34></a> I leave all that, their judgment and their course, entirely out of question.<a name=185:35></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I should in England, as indeed I have done, go on my own ground, the Lord's, I believe, and if they liked to come on that, well -- if not, well.<a name=185:36></a> I shall go on no other; alone or with beloved brethren, I shall go on what I believe the Lord wills I should go on .<a name=185:37></a>.<a name=185:38></a>.<a name=185:39></a> .<a name=185:40></a> I am quite decided to walk in what I am satisfied is the Lord's.<a name=185:41></a> If they do not like it, I have no desire nor thought of quarrelling: we shall not walk together.<a name=185:42></a> The Lord will judge who is right.<a name=185:43></a> That judgment I accept beforehand, and bow to it with my whole heart.<a name=185:44></a> Hence it is I am in no hurry, and, I may add, full of confidence.<a name=185:45></a> I see abundant failure in myself, but it is not where others see it -- just the contrary; but I believe in the Lord's grace.<a name=185:46></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe He has confided a testimony to me, however feeble I may be and unworthy.<a name=185:47></a> I do not say that to the exclusion of others of His servants, but as that for which I am responsible.<a name=185:48></a> I believe I failed in it, and I trust now in my little measure I may not.<a name=185:49></a> Until I am myself in England, I refrain from all interference in what passes there, because I wait upon God, not being yet called upon to act.<a name=185:50></a> The cloud seems rising to lead me back .<a name=185:51></a>.<a name=185:52></a>.<a name=185:53></a> .<a name=185:54></a> In general there is considerable blessing in the work, with the usual opposition.<a name=185:55></a>

		[W Kelly] BELOVED BROTHER, -- I received the two notes, but long after you wrote them, and when on my journey I have just received your last.<a name=187:1></a> This difficulty at once presented itself in answering your notes, that to answer them requires a discussion of the whole scope and bearing of the prophetic word; and not only that, but of other subjects, without which that bearing can never be understood.<a name=187:2></a> Two means present themselves: the reply to the errors or abuse of prophetic statements, or the substantive development of the truth.<a name=187:3></a> Now to this latter there is the difficulty, that the reader is not in possession of the principles which enable him to seize the force of such development, and it is difficult to answer a false system without the elements existing in the mind to be disabused, which render it capable of judging the falseness of it, and seizing the truth.<a name=187:4></a> The false system is adapted to the state of soul of the mass of Christians even, but God is faithful.<a name=187:5></a> To do this at all properly would require a long work, which would set all on its right base, and thus develop the truth and refute error.<a name=187:6></a> But there is always this difficulty, and the truth must ever make its way against it, and so it does at length.<a name=187:7></a> Positive evil remains till judged of God.<a name=187:8></a> The false systems which abuse the minds of saints perish and disappear before the truth.<a name=187:9></a> Besides, many, as Maitland, Burgh and Co.<a name=187:10></a>, have used certain truth in Satan's behalf to undermine important present moral bearings of truth; hence God would permit minds to be rescued from their influence by what restored these moral bearings, though imperfect in interpretation unless both were given; for He will keep His saints as a present thing above all.<a name=187:11></a> This does not render the truth less important, but makes one feel the need of God's help to make it good.<a name=187:12></a> I see no means to work effectually but this: to answer the works which mislead, so as to overthrow them, while disclaiming the evil principles of Maitland, etc.<a name=187:13></a>; but this, as means of stopping and getting rid of evil, so as to be able to nurture the positive development of the elements of [Christianity].<a name=187:14></a>

		Dearest G V Wigram, -- I have been studying the infidel objections; I find them excessively miserable, most of them as old as Celsus, in general without the least foundation, unless the privilege of doubting, and proof of a desire to find difficulties.<a name=188:1></a> The question takes two aspects, historical authority; and as to this, the character of the enmity is proof of it, but of more, namely, of inspiration, and the divine character of Christianity; for there is no such enmity against the history of Mahomet, no such anxiety to disprove it -- the why is evident.<a name=188:2></a> But what would not invalidate history, may (seemingly) literal inspiration, for all men may mistake, and do -- the best informed -- the Lord cannot.<a name=188:3></a> But I see nothing to enfeeble the fullest inspiration really understood as of God.<a name=188:4></a> The great mistake is supposing that it is made to satisfy man according to his thoughts, and not to communicate God's with perfect certainty.<a name=188:5></a> This last is needed, and, I am more than satisfied, exists; but were it in a way to satisfy the exigencies of men's minds, it would lose for me its divine proofs .<a name=188:6></a>.<a name=188:7></a>.<a name=188:8></a> .<a name=188:9></a>

		It is a great mistake to think that nothing can give testimony to itself.<a name=189:1></a> Supposing a man, noble, generous, forbearing in his ways, do I want a testimony to him?<a name=189:2></a> He is his own testimony.<a name=189:3></a> The character of the Lord's miracles there is nothing like, not merely in false or devilish miracles, but not even in the Old Testament.<a name=189:4></a> God's character as love, power and light is in them.<a name=189:5></a> They are not mere wonders.<a name=189:6></a> Who ever took a candle to see if he could see the sun?<a name=189:7></a> And if a man cannot see it, what do I conclude of him?<a name=189:8></a>

		[J G Deck] BELOVED BROTHER, -- I should except more against the general bearing of your argument than against particular passages in it.<a name=190:1></a><a href="#190:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> Indeed I know of one whom it sent back into the Establishment, and justly if received; for you quote me as saying it is no church, and hence that they do not apply to it; in your argument upon them you leave room for no such distinction, nor do you even suppose that what has been a church can cease to be so by some principle it adopts.<a name=190:2></a> Your general reasoning is this: you are to judge the evil individuals, but in no case the body.<a name=190:3></a> Suppose, as in Sardis, very few to be such as will walk with Christ in white, and the mass to be unconverted -- never mind, you are not to separate, however degenerate they are become.<a name=190:4></a> Now how is an ordinary mind to distinguish this from the Establishment?<a name=190:5></a> And you carry this so far, that you go through the churches, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, and press that the Lord even never acts against the body, but only against those that have sinned -- an argument without any force, because it omits Ephesus, whose candlestick is to be removed for the smallest departure, and Laodicea, which is wholly vomited out of His mouth.<a name=190:6></a> Now whatever use you make of this, it makes your deduction of no value; because according to your way of putting it, Ephesus would be wholly rejected for "a fall which no eye marked but His own;" and Pergamos and Thyatira would not, for the grossest allowed evil.<a name=190:7></a> The conclusion I draw is, that your manner of reasoning about it is unsound.<a name=190:8></a> I think the contrast I alleged as to the Establishment best; but it does not reach this case, though it was a just answer to Mr.<a name=190:9></a> J.<a name=190:10></a> Kelly;<a href="#190:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a> and I still hold the principles I there stated: only they do not reach the case either, which was not properly then before me.<a name=190:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not think you can justly reason from Christ's dealing with a church to my dealing with it -- a principle I did not enter on, nor perhaps think of, in writing to Mr.<a name=190:12></a> K.<a name=190:13></a> First, because God can bear with evil with which I ought not: witness His bearing with the world, Babylon, from out of which I am called to come.<a name=190:14></a> Secondly, because in many cases He can judge the wicked only by a discriminating judgment in power, as in the cases you refer to in Revelation 2, 3, and as He will do at the end of the age, which I cannot.<a name=190:15></a> Hence a conclusion from His judgment to ours is unsound.<a name=190:16></a> We do not remove candlesticks either; though the Lord may validate our acts as to it, binding what we bind, or loosing what we loose if it be according to His mind.<a name=190:17></a> But we ought, namely, a body of saints assembled in Christ's name ought, to answer the appeal of the Spirit to these churches, and repent if there be evil, and not continue in the evil -- thus, if it had Nicolaitanes or Jezebel, not leave them if it could put them out -- unless recovered by and to the truth.<a name=190:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the case you speak of is not reached yet, or rather which you do not speak of, save by an allusion in a note.<a name=190:19></a> Supposing a body refuses to act in discipline, supposing after service as to its degeneracy, or in spite of remonstrance, or in any way which shews deliberate principle, it will accept of false doctrine, or false practice, specially as to what concerns Christ's glory (though all really does), what am I then to do?<a name=190:20></a> Walk with it -- namely, accept myself also in my own acts the sin of which the Holy Ghost calls me to repent?<a name=190:21></a> I admit such a case ought never to be.<a name=190:22></a> My reasoning with Mr.<a name=190:23></a> K.<a name=190:24></a> was on the ground, that the principle and system were God's own.<a name=190:25></a> Is that the case when doctrinal dishonour to Christ, heresy, or immorality is accepted as admissible in the church of God, namely, compatible with Christ's house and with Himself?<a name=190:26></a> Is that God's principle and system?<a name=190:27></a> I know well you will say not, in an instant.<a name=190:28></a> Whether there has been sufficient patience is another question, and a very serious one; because God will be just and patient, if we are not: whether the right steps have, or have not, been taken, is so too: I think wrong ones were in some cases as to Bethesda.<a name=190:29></a> But that cannot now affect my relationship with such or such a body, though it may render my path more difficult.<a name=190:30></a> I can only say God will suffice for all, and turn all to good; and we must wait on Him, and on His leadings.<a name=190:31></a> We deal thus with hundreds of professing bodies, on one ground or another.<a name=190:32></a> If the principle of union in Christ were to be explained as meaning necessary continuance in, or admission of, evil, the brethren would be the wickedest sect or body in existence.<a name=190:33></a> Yet if evil is accepted, or refused to be put away, after all due measures are employed; if jealousy for Christ's honour be not the principle of union, that is, of the action of those united, this horrible principle is admitted.<a name=190:34></a> This being so, the question is one of fact.<a name=190:35></a> Of that I am satisfied.<a name=190:36></a> I suppose you also are now.<a name=190:37></a> And the mistakes in the manner of dealing with the evil of which others are guilty can never change the principles on which I am to act for myself, though it may render its application more difficult; which I do not doubt is the case, though I believe God, our faithful God, has overruled it for good, as He does in His wondrous grace everything for those that love Him.<a name=190:38></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I said you alluded to the principle, in which you evidently contradict your whole tract, and prove (forgive my saying so) that you reason from feeling, not from principle.<a name=190:39></a> "Our course here is .<a name=190:40></a>.<a name=190:41></a>.<a name=190:42></a> thirdly, to reject any coming from a place, or teacher avowedly [you mean, 'known to be,' for no one avows it] heretical, however professedly sound themselves, unless they would cease from all fellowship with such place or teacher.<a name=190:43></a>" Be it so: but now (supposing it had been once a sound gathering, or treated as such) if degeneracy claimed service, not departure, you compel the sound man to depart from his gathering, though possibly the majority might be sound, and only the teachers perverting them (or indeed, vice versa); that is, you insist on his doing what you condemn.<a name=190:44></a> You are right in insisting on it (unless it be real ignorance of the case or facts); but then, how does, as an absolute principle, evil and corruption or false doctrine not claim departure?<a name=190:45></a> Your conscience is right; your tract leads people all wrong.<a name=190:46></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have been asked how much corruption would make me leave a gathering (supposing it once formed on true principle); I answered, no degree of corruption as a fact.<a name=190:47></a> But a refusal on principle, or deliberately by the body, to remove the least, or at any rate to seek to remove it, would make me leave it; and for the reason in my answer to Mr.<a name=190:48></a> K.<a name=190:49></a>: it would be not God's own system, but the opposite to it in the most possible way.<a name=190:50></a> I would make a remark here.<a name=190:51></a> You will find when a man walks with God, whatever his progress in the depths of the divine counsels or prophetic apprehension of His ways, and of what is passing around him, certain elementary parts of God's character and truth retain their full importance, and render him clear in judgment and sound in mind.<a name=190:52></a> Evil cannot have to say to or go on with God, nor God with it.<a name=190:53></a> Surely nothing simpler.<a name=190:54></a> Seducing power will always sin against some such truth as this; hence the godly man, however simple, is not deceived by brilliant or fascinating power or appearances.<a name=190:55></a> See Romans 2, how the plainest elements are laid at the bar of all the amazing scheme of doctrine which judged the wily effects of Judaizing teachers.<a name=190:56></a> See the message which Christ brought as the eternal life which was with the Father, in 1 John 1.<a name=190:57></a> You will tell me love, and love to the brethren, is one of these elements.<a name=190:58></a> I accept it; but I add, love to the brethren is distinguished from the faint human resemblance to it, by its consistency with the principle I have referred to, "By this we know that we love the brethren, when we love God and keep his commandments.<a name=190:59></a>" Thus it is distinguished from a coterie, or human kindness of nature.<a name=190:60></a> It is clear if I go with two of your children, and lead them away from your will, it is not as your children I love them.<a name=190:61></a> There is no doubt that love, love of all the brethren is a distinctive mark of divine life.<a name=190:62></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another principle I add in connection with this, dear brother.<a name=190:63></a> If we are walking with God, and looking to the church as Christ's, and that the house should be His, and so holy, and thus His honour sought to be maintained in it in grace, we shall trust Him <i>for it</i>.<a name=190:64></a> He is as Son over His own house, and most faithful in it; He will govern and rebuke according to the light we have, but never forsake.<a name=190:65></a> If I have failed in a simple ready seizing of the light, I may wait a moment, or go softly till I see my way, but I never shall distrust Him as to it.<a name=190:66></a> He it is that works for it, and alone can communicate blessing.<a name=190:67></a> For my own part, though I have felt all this very humbling, I have never doubted this a moment.<a name=190:68></a> I think it behoves us to go softly, but the more decidedly in the path of our feet, the more we feel that we have been straying.<a name=190:69></a> I am afraid afterwards to get at all away from Him.<a name=190:70></a> And that is true decision in the conscience; decision in energy is another thing, though it has always this for its basis.<a name=190:71></a> The camp was at Gilgal, wherever the victories were: if not, it was soon at Bochim.<a name=190:72></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the attacks, notice that the spirit of the world is working in those who condemn the principles I press.<a name=190:73></a> Hence I agree entirely that we (when needed) deal with individuals; but then I should see whether they had the principle of inter-communion with evil.<a name=190:74></a> If so, they are in heart of the principle of the gathering which you avowedly reject.<a name=190:75></a> This is a part of their state before the Lord.<a name=190:76></a> And if knowing that the gathering they come from hold this principle, and I could not lead them to renounce it, and necessarily (consequently, if honest) the gathering, I could not receive them.<a name=190:77></a> Indifferentism under the name of charity is the great snare now, not avowed error, and it is <i>wickedness of heart</i>, and that is the fruit.<a name=190:78></a> If I found them <i>bona fide</i> ignorant, and in heart opposed to this horrible principle, for my part I could receive them; only I should plainly warn them of their error and inconsistency in going back where the principle they condemned was acted on; I assume them to be ignorant themselves of the fact.<a name=190:79></a> It is only your own principle, of page 11 of the tract, applied to indifferentism.<a name=190:80></a> For a poor ignorant saint might never have perceived a heresy in the teacher, and yet gradually have his mind infected; and so of indifferentism; and I have seen sad cases.<a name=190:81></a> Let us only remember that both are the influence of Satan over the mind, and we shall seek the deliverance of souls, and charity will not be content without it; though in present circumstances (nay, in such cases generally) we have to avoid the appearance of sectarianism, proselytising, or attacks on others, the appearance of which only turns the ignorant, the very persons I speak of, away.<a name=190:82></a> I do seek bona fide faithfulness to get such delivered, not the seeking of quiet at the expense of Christ.<a name=190:83></a> Getting as you are out of a mistaken path or judgment, I feel quietness is even suitable, but the more we have felt we have erred, the more will conscience be decided if it is at work.<a name=190:84></a> The standing alone is a temptation, [a] mere escaping the burden of the church's sorrow.<a name=190:85></a> Had I sought this, I might have stayed comfortably where hundreds and thousands even [would] walk in peace with me, but I do not believe the Lord would have left me comfortable.<a name=190:86></a> He is too faithful.<a name=190:87></a> He would have proved me there.<a name=190:88></a> Indeed, in these cases it is either seeking to be roused by other and greater trouble, or, worse still, left where we have sought our own ease.<a name=190:89></a> No; our path is humbleness and even humiliation and lowliness, but full and entire confidence in Christ.<a name=190:90></a> We feel our sins and faults right when we can bring them to Him, and there we find His strength for the sorrow they have occasioned.<a name=190:91></a> Up to that, we seek our ease in the flesh, or have preferred some of them, to all the sorrow of heart they have occasioned.<a name=190:92></a> I hope that is all done with.<a name=190:93></a> You see I go a good deal further than you, but I shall be glad to hear what you say, as regards receiving: the intercommunion principle we have in common.<a name=190:94></a> Then further, I desire and seek unfeignedly restoration, but real, to God and before God, not playing at it to ease our own minds, but godly humble true return to and walking with Him according to His will, jealousy for Christ, and deliverance from the deceiving or blinding power of the enemy in habits of thinking; for this is the way He is working; of which we have the plainest proofs to my mind.<a name=190:95></a>

		[E Maylen] [From the French.<a name=197:14></a>] BELOVED BROTHER, -- We are here at a conference in which, thank God, we have been much blessed; we have read in order the Gospel of John, but it leaves me little time for writing to you.<a name=197:15></a> I was delighted to receive your account of Lyons.<a name=197:16></a> You know that I spent some days in that town coming from the south, and many things had already taken place, and I saw many people also.<a name=197:17></a> The meeting and the work have been much on my heart since then, so that your letter has been a great refreshment to me.<a name=197:18></a> In the condition in which brethren are there, in which we are all as a whole, it is not an evil that souls should come one by one.<a name=197:19></a> I do not believe either that those who have been brought up in system are in such a condition that they could walk without causing uneasiness and falsifying the path of brethren.<a name=197:20></a> There ought to be enough power amongst them to be able to receive every converted soul in L.<a name=197:21></a>, whatever his condition might be; also in fact they would have no right to refuse any; but I rather doubt their being at present in the state to do so, and if God is doing that which tends to render to Him and to maintain for Him a true testimony, I can bless Him for it, although it is certainly humbling for brethren.<a name=197:22></a> They ought to answer to all the necessities of the church, but it is useless to pretend to what they are not; besides, we must leave God to act according to His perfect wisdom, and He is acting in grace, blessed be His name for it.<a name=197:23></a> We ought to remember also that we come on the scene when everything is already spoiled; however, Christ is sufficient for everything.<a name=197:24></a> We must seek to separate the precious from the vile, and we can count upon His grace.<a name=197:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to my letter, I hold fast to not giving to our position, that is at L.<a name=197:26></a>, an anti-baptist character.<a name=197:27></a> While deeply convinced of it, and believing that I have the light of God thereupon, I would as much avoid being an anti-baptist as a baptist.<a name=197:28></a> I really desire the union of all Christians in the unity of the body of Christ.<a name=197:29></a> If any one has the conviction that he has not been baptised, I think he does very well in getting himself baptised.<a name=197:30></a> My desire is that we should be one, as we are one in Christ.<a name=197:31></a> Now I should be much grieved if the meeting in L.<a name=197:32></a> was founded on opposition to baptists.<a name=197:33></a> We have need to be founded on grace, on that which also edifies; and that the reality of the power of the Holy Ghost should unite us in the practical grace of Jesus Himself; that our life should be of Him, and for Him; that He should live in us and that thus we should be one.<a name=197:34></a> If the publication of my letter gave a sectarian colour to our meeting by pre-occupying minds with a subject below Christ Himself, I should much regret it, and this, dear brother, is what I dread.<a name=197:35></a> If you can offer them to persons who wish for them as a mean of appreciating truth, and in order to prevent souls from falling into a sectarian spirit, I desire no better.<a name=197:36></a> With these remarks, dear brother, I leave the matter in your hands; you can dispose of the letter as you think well.<a name=197:37></a> You will examine before God if you can use it with this object: perhaps if you think well to have it printed you can do so without publishing it, and you can add by way of counsel what I have just said; I mean the substance of the thought.<a name=197:38></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I bless God with all my heart for His goodness towards our feeble testimony, for I have good news from Nmes also.<a name=197:39></a> I feel this the more because I felt that I ought to come here, and the work in the south was much on my heart.<a name=197:40></a> God is blessing us here; the spirit of the brethren is simple, humble, and grace rules in their relations.<a name=197:41></a> We are having a conference here for the study of the word in which we have been certainly blessed, and I hope that it has even done much good.<a name=197:42></a> I must conclude my letter; I have much to do.<a name=197:43></a> Grace and peace be with you, dear brother.<a name=197:44></a> Greet the brethren affectionately.<a name=197:45></a> I must leave you in order to revise the translation of the Synopsis on Kings for a few moments before our meeting.<a name=197:46></a> May God be with you.<a name=197:47></a>

		[E Maylen] [To the same.<a name=199:1></a>] [From the French.<a name=199:2></a>] BELOVED BROTHER, -- Your letter reached me here on my way.<a name=199:3></a> I answer without delay.<a name=199:4></a> Anxiety which anticipates evil is not the faith which faces the difficulties through which God sees it well to make us pass, and in which the conscience is consequently engaged.<a name=199:5></a> Mr.<a name=199:6></a> W.<a name=199:7></a> had engaged me to write to Switzerland on the subject of this business.<a name=199:8></a> I am waiting, while leaning on the goodness of the Lord, who loves His church, who knows if it ought to trouble them.<a name=199:9></a> I am waiting on God that He may grant them to be faithful, and give them all the necessary instruction if the difficulty arises.<a name=199:10></a> He has done so already in a wonderful way in the case of Mr.<a name=199:11></a> N.<a name=199:12></a>'s agents who went there: why should I not trust Him for every other case?<a name=199:13></a> .<a name=199:14></a>.<a name=199:15></a>.<a name=199:16></a> I do not wish to raise questions where the brethren are in peace, hoping that God will give the needful wisdom when the question is raised: why occupy them with it beforehand, when the conscience is not yet involved?<a name=199:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With regard to Mr.<a name=199:18></a> -- , I have not seen him since the Bethesda question arose, so it is possible that by presenting the matter clearly to him and to his conscience he would be brought back, even if he has at present gone astray.<a name=199:19></a> I suppose that he is more or less connected with Bethesda; now if it is so, and if he rejected warnings, and persisted in keeping up connection with B.<a name=199:20></a>, I could not walk with him; I am going to tell you why, leaving him aside, not knowing what would be the effect of a conversation with him.<a name=199:21></a> First I must tell you that I believe that if one meeting receives the members of another, and the members of the former go there in their turn, there is a bond between the two, although I own that in the present case other motives have power over me.<a name=199:22></a> This is how it is then as to B.<a name=199:23></a> Doctrine is not in question, but faithfulness to Christ with respect to doctrine or holiness.<a name=199:24></a> I would not receive a person who knowingly formed part of a meeting which admits heretics, or persons whose conduct is bad, because the principle of indifference to good and evil, to error and truth, is a bad as the wrong action, and even worse.<a name=199:25></a> Let me be clearly understood.<a name=199:26></a> I believe that the church is bound to be jealous with respect to the glory of the Person of Christ.<a name=199:27></a> If Christ is despised, I have no principle of union.<a name=199:28></a> I believe that B.<a name=199:29></a> has acted with profound contempt for the Lord, to say nothing of brethren.<a name=199:30></a> Here there is nothing equivocal.<a name=199:31></a> Mr.<a name=199:32></a> N.<a name=199:33></a> was maintaining a doctrine of which Mr.<a name=199:34></a> Mller himself said that if it were true, Christ would have needed to be saved as much as we did.<a name=199:35></a> This doctrine placed Christ under the effect of Adam's sin by His birth, in saying that He had to gain life by keeping the law.<a name=199:36></a> We had driven away this doctrine and those who upheld it, and the struggle was ended.<a name=199:37></a> The persons who had supported Mr.<a name=199:38></a> N.<a name=199:39></a> had published confessions with respect to the doctrine, and had made confessions before the brethren publicly of the falsehoods and wickedness by which they had tried to make good their views and to justify themselves; it was a truly extraordinary work of Satan.<a name=199:40></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, a lady wished to introduce Mr.<a name=199:41></a> N.<a name=199:42></a> to teach in a meeting near Bethesda; this meeting refused; she left the meeting accordingly.<a name=199:43></a> She was introduced at B.<a name=199:44></a>, Mr.<a name=199:45></a> M.<a name=199:46></a> knowing that she was maintaining and propagating this doctrine, Mr.<a name=199:47></a> Craik the other pastor having had to do with her.<a name=199:48></a> She went there because they admitted such persons into that meeting.<a name=199:49></a> At the same time, two gentlemen, who made part of the meeting which Mr.<a name=199:50></a> N.<a name=199:51></a> had formed when he was obliged to leave on account of his doctrine (those who had supported him having left him and made confession), these two communicants of Mr.<a name=199:52></a> N.<a name=199:53></a>'s, I say, were also admitted to B.<a name=199:54></a> It is proved true that these three disseminated Mr.<a name=199:55></a> N.<a name=199:56></a>'s tracts in the B.<a name=199:57></a> assembly.<a name=199:58></a> The lady induced a young lady to go who was the most active and intelligent agent that Mr.<a name=199:59></a> N.<a name=199:60></a> had, in order to spread his doctrines.<a name=199:61></a> In consequence of these circumstances, several godly brothers of B.<a name=199:62></a> asked that all this should be examined; they said that they did not ask even that the judgment of the brethren should be taken thereupon, but that they should examine the matter and the doctrine themselves.<a name=199:63></a> This was decidedly refused.<a name=199:64></a> I received a letter from Mr.<a name=199:65></a> C.<a name=199:66></a>, blaming me as sectarian for making these difficulties, even when he was not prepared to receive everything that Mr.<a name=199:67></a> N.<a name=199:68></a> was teaching.<a name=199:69></a> They had many meetings of the flock and the ten labouring brothers (of whom two were really disciples of Mr.<a name=199:70></a> N.<a name=199:71></a>), Messrs.<a name=199:72></a> M.<a name=199:73></a> and C.<a name=199:74></a> at their head, presented a written paper to the assembly at B.<a name=199:75></a>, declaring that this was a new test of communion, which they would not admit; that many excellent brethren did not give so decided an opinion upon Mr.<a name=199:76></a> N.<a name=199:77></a>'s doctrine; that they were not bound to read fifty pages to know what Mr.<a name=199:78></a> N.<a name=199:79></a> taught, the members of his flock being -- mark this!<a name=199:80></a> -- already admitted at B.<a name=199:81></a> A brother asked permission to communicate some information about Mr.<a name=199:82></a> N.<a name=199:83></a>'s doctrine, in order that the assembly might understand why they held to it that the doctrine should be judged; and this was peremptorily refused, and the paper which said that many had not a bad opinion of the doctrine, rejecting as a new condition of fellowship the examination into the doctrine, was laid down as the absolute condition of the pastorate of Messrs.<a name=199:84></a> M.<a name=199:85></a> and C.<a name=199:86></a>, without which they would withdraw from their ministry in the midst of the assembly.<a name=199:87></a> Those who justified them on the ground of this paper were to rise, which was done by the assembly, thirty or forty forthwith leaving B.<a name=199:88></a> So that, with knowledge of the matter, they laid down as the basis of the B.<a name=199:89></a> assembly, indifference to the truth as to the Person of Christ; and they preferred to see about forty godly brethren leave, rather than to examine into the question, having in fact in their midst the members of the N.<a name=199:90></a> meeting.<a name=199:91></a> This was so much the more important in my eyes, because Satan was seeking at that moment, and still seeks, to forbid the assembly of the children of God to examine into and to judge any heresy whatsoever; that once a person has been acknowledged as being a Christian, one has no right to know what he holds.<a name=199:92></a> This has been plainly laid down as a principle by many persons who blame us, and they desired to take advantage of it to force us to receive a young man who distinctly denied that there was such a Person as the Holy Ghost.<a name=199:93></a> I do not say that all lay down this principle, but the enemy has sought to bring it in, and amongst the brethren who opposed me on this question, some of the most violent maintain it.<a name=199:94></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the principle of indifference as to the Person of Christ being laid down at Bethesda, and the assembly having publicly accepted it, I refuse to admit this principle.<a name=199:95></a> They have admitted persons put outside amongst us on account of blasphemy.<a name=199:96></a> Messrs.<a name=199:97></a> M.<a name=199:98></a> and C.<a name=199:99></a> are the pastors of the assembly in virtue of this principle.<a name=199:100></a> This letter has never been withdrawn: they claim to have done right.<a name=199:101></a> Many things will doubtless be told you in excuse, and to make it appear that they have done things which nullify this: I know how it is with them.<a name=199:102></a> For me their condition before God has become much, <i>much</i> worse.<a name=199:103></a> I should be ready to say why.<a name=199:104></a> I believe that they are themselves more or less infected with false doctrine, but I cannot enter into the story in detail.<a name=199:105></a> Mr.<a name=199:106></a> M.<a name=199:107></a> said to <i>me</i> (after having acknowledged that Christ would have needed to be saved as much as we, if this doctrine was admitted) that they maintained the letter of the ten to the full, and that they had done well in all that they had done.<a name=199:108></a> Well, indifference to Christ is a grave sin: an assembly which bases itself publicly on this principle I cannot accept as a Christian assembly.<a name=199:109></a> Assemblies which are connected with B.<a name=199:110></a>, which go there and receive from thence, are one with B.<a name=199:111></a> -- save the case of persons who are ignorant of the matter, an exceptional case of which it is not necessary to speak.<a name=199:112></a> For my part this is what I do; having distinctly taken my position I judge each case individually according to its merits, but I will not receive a person who keeps up his connection with B.<a name=199:113></a> with knowledge of the matter.<a name=199:114></a> Faithfulness to Christ before everything; I know not why I labour and suffer if this is not the principle of my conduct.<a name=199:115></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The fact is that brethren had fallen into a state of spiritual demoralisation which required this sifting, and as they get out of it individually they reject B.<a name=199:116></a>, which is taking place, thank God, every day.<a name=199:117></a> Persons who have written tracts against me write their own condemnation, while declaring that they were deceived at Bristol.<a name=199:118></a> As to that, my resolution is taken: I am deeply convinced that the basis of the B.<a name=199:119></a> meeting is contempt of Christ, and I do not walk with those who accept it, and I will not mix with it; it would be indifference to my own conduct.<a name=199:120></a> If consequently I walk alone it is well; I am content as to myself; I deplore the condition of souls.<a name=199:121></a> I do not say that all that has been done to oppose it has been wise.<a name=199:122></a> I do not think so, but my judgment of the matter in the main is definitively taken.<a name=199:123></a> I believe B.<a name=199:124></a> in a much worse condition than at the beginning of the question.<a name=199:125></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not desire to introduce such a question into the midst of brethren who are not in fact engaged in the evil.<a name=199:126></a> I fear Mr.<a name=199:127></a> W.<a name=199:128></a> is inclined to do so.<a name=199:129></a> He has done so to some degree here in my opinion.<a name=199:130></a>

		[From the French.<a name=206:1></a>] Mons.<a name=206:2></a> Eynard, I have often, of late, insisted upon the fact, that all sorts of things are related in the scriptures: the malice of Satan, the mistakes and evil thoughts of men, their sins, unmixed evil, a mixture of good and evil, things and words where the influence of the Holy Spirit in the heart finds its way athwart the prejudices and the thoughts of men.<a name=206:3></a> But all these things are given us in the word by inspiration, in order that we may know man and the ways of God.<a name=206:4></a> At the same time, God's own thoughts are also communicated to us in order to enable us to judge all this according to His judgment.<a name=206:5></a> Thus we comprehend, in a far truer way, the state of man and all that is connected with his relations with God.<a name=206:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I seek in an inspired book, is the perfect communication of the thoughts of God, such as He deigns to communicate them to me, and a perfect history of man, a history such that possessing the thoughts of God, I may perfectly judge of what man is, as God, the God of truth, would shew him to me.<a name=206:7></a> Now, for this, I must know his faults, his thoughts, what he is without law, under law, under the influence of affections which the Holy Spirit produces, whether the flesh is entirely mortified or, in what proceeds from the heart, it colours the affections produced, giving them the form of the individual's condition of mind.<a name=206:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this latter case, when it is a question of this mixture, I do not take the result as the proper expression of the thoughts of God, nor as affections absolutely approved of Him, such at least as they are expressed.<a name=206:9></a> But I accept what is told, as a revelation from God, which makes man known to me in that phase.<a name=206:10></a> For the effect of the work of God in man will only be perfect, when, in the glory, we reflect what He is according to the pattern of Jesus, to whose image we shall be conformed.<a name=206:11></a> The moment we have to do with the thoughts of God revealed directly, it is another thing; but man depicted by God, the work of Satan, the effect of the work of God in man, are never that.<a name=206:12></a> There is difficulty only in this latter case, on account of the mixture.<a name=206:13></a> For my own part, I do not doubt that a powerful effect of the Spirit of God is often produced, where the moral form with which that which produces it is clothed participates, to a very great degree, in all the thoughts of the class of persons who are the vessels and channels of it.<a name=206:14></a> The Holy Spirit produces zeal and affections; their form is often that of the religious education of the individual, or even of the nation.<a name=206:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there may be a mass of souls who are loose, and do not like the trouble of being faithful, or in such a time, the question connected with it.<a name=207:17></a> But alas!<a name=207:18></a> they are then gathered to acquiescence in unfaithfulness, and the world is more or less there -- religious world perhaps, but not the cross properly.<a name=207:19></a> If the cross be not taken up, this ensnares, that is, if Christ be not everything and the world therefore not wanted, and its neglect therefore easy to bear.<a name=207:20></a> Some few simple souls may be ensnared, but they will get out when exercised in God's time.<a name=207:21></a> But then, on the other hand, this settling of questions even rightly will not gather souls.<a name=207:22></a> We must be right as to what they are gathered to: but it must be a Christ in power and grace, without any questions, that gathers them.<a name=207:23></a> God alone can give this, and He will not, till there be sufficient exercise to make the Christ gathered to, the same Christ as that which gathers.<a name=207:24></a> But it is free out-going grace alone that gathers.<a name=207:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not know if at -- you are quite at this point; but I count it a great grace the Lord has so dealt with the brethren.<a name=207:26></a> The good effect on souls has been astonishingly evident also; they are worth morally incomparably more than they were.<a name=207:27></a> If it be not arrived there, it will suffer yet awhile, but the apparent advantage of the unfaithful will be hollow and worldly, a mere re-descent into the mixed religious system of the day.<a name=207:28></a> When it is not, it will be a restless angry feeling, as I see in some gatherings elsewhere, especially when the Lord allows blessing to flow a little elsewhere; and they do not escape worldliness after all.<a name=207:29></a> Then they will have more rich and respectable people who like looseness and liberty in religious things, but it is not a real testimony to Christ.<a name=207:30></a> But, I repeat, living grace bringing in grace, Christ by the Holy Ghost from heaven, to souls, can alone really gather and recruit souls.<a name=207:31></a>

		MY DEAR BROTHER, -- After a meeting for humiliation<a href="#210:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> of some brethren habitually walking in fellowship together, some who were separated from them seemed to have had the desire to have taken part in it, and to have been prepared to do so.<a name=210:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A desire being formed in my own mind for a meeting for humiliation, and having spoken to others of it, I have found it, thank God, to be the common desire of many -- universal, I think I may say, with those who have felt bound, as it is well known, to be decided as to what they judged to be evil, and participated in -- I am led to believe, by many from whom they have been unhappily separated; for unhappy it surely will be felt to be, even if the judgment may have been convinced that it was inevitable.<a name=210:2></a> I feel assured that God has wrought this desire for humiliation, and disposed the hearts of one and another to it.<a name=210:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The point on which I should propose to meet with brethren is, that we feel that we have failed in maintaining the glory of God in that which was committed to our trust, though He may not in grace have taken it from us -- a serious and solemn thought.<a name=210:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Each one would in his own conscience take to himself the share in this, for which he would feel himself responsible before God.<a name=210:5></a> The subject of our common humiliation would be the result we are all conscious of.<a name=210:6></a> I am ready for my own part to take the first and largest share in this.<a name=210:7></a> It is not a confession of others' faults I look for, but a common one of us all before God, each taking his part as the Holy Ghost may in sovereign grace shew it to him.<a name=210:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		No one who comes is supposed thereby to relinquish any judgment he has formed as to evil, or any course he has pursued as to it.<a name=210:9></a> On the other hand, those who have blamed many of the acts of the brethren here alluded to are not supposed to be committed to any approval (or disapproval) of them.<a name=210:10></a> For my own part, I am ignorant of most, and myself dissent from some I do know of.<a name=210:11></a> Any change in this respect must be left to the Holy Ghost, if such there is to be.<a name=210:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I say this, not to raise any question as to what is not the object of the meeting, but to meet one which would naturally arise, and might be a hindrance to one otherwise disposed to join in it, and thus remove the difficulty.<a name=210:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The object of the meeting is one only -- humiliation, because we have failed to glorify God.<a name=210:14></a> It is to join in this that any one should come, if he comes at all, with the desire that God may grant blessing to us by it.<a name=210:15></a> Such is my trust as to the meeting.<a name=210:16></a> I trust God's blessing may attend it.<a name=210:17></a> I feel that it is the place that becomes us.<a name=210:18></a> Through His grace it may be the means of blessing, nor would I limit the extent of that which God might grant by it.<a name=210:19></a> His grace is beyond our measure of it, or our thoughts.<a name=210:20></a> Though, of course, it more immediately concerns those who have been placed in the unhappy circumstances known to us all, if any Christian who has never been mixed up with the questions which have given occasion to it, nor belonged to an assembly of those amongst whom the circumstances have arisen, felt really desirous, as a member of Christ's body, and convinced that the testimony of God was concerned in it, he would have gladly a place amongst those who have given occasion to the humiliation called for.<a name=210:21></a> If any in Bethesda desire really to join in humiliation, it is not desired to exclude them, and means would be taken to afford them the opportunity in such a way as would not involve any one in any sanction or acceptance of what they judge to be evil.<a name=210:22></a>

		DEAREST BROTHER, -- I must, of course, expect every one to take his own view of the meeting, and rely only on my hope that God will take His; but there seems to me to be some haste in your correspondent, as there has been, I think, in much that has been done.<a name=212:1></a> Where did he find "any allusion to the sin and separation existing to be excluded"?<a name=212:2></a> It is as new to me as to you.<a name=212:3></a> How could I pretend to dictate the prayers and confessions each should make?<a name=212:4></a> It was a point on which I had pre-eminently to trust God.<a name=212:5></a> I desire none to be there but those thoroughly humbled.<a name=212:6></a> If they are, God will surely guide in the confessions they are to make.<a name=212:7></a> I am sure if any one in his prayer -- which I have no right or reason to suppose -- prayed against me as a maker of schism and the like, it would be to have himself judged as to the doing it on such an occasion.<a name=212:8></a> It would work together for good.<a name=212:9></a> I have stated as distinctly as possible in every invitation, that those who have been, as I think, justly decided, are to be understood as implying no change whatever by coming.<a name=212:10></a> -- wanted to have a vague invitation, leaving this out, but I did not comply.<a name=212:11></a> I did not bind the others who came to any approval of the acts of the former by coming, leaving all changes in this to God's working in individuals.<a name=212:12></a> If there are among them any disposed to join us in humiliation and nothing else, without our giving up our judgment, I would not refuse them; what I sought was this one point, because I saw some did desire it.<a name=212:13></a> I think if any one went there to <i>accuse</i> B.<a name=212:14></a> (and my own judgment is more than confirmed as to its evil) instead of confessing his own part in the evil, and humbling himself because of the dishonour done to the Lord, as a great public fact among us, he had much better stay away; for the object of the meeting is to humble <i>ourselves</i> because <i>we</i> have failed, not to accuse any, however evil they may have been.<a name=212:15></a> This is my whole object in the meeting, to take for myself the place of humiliation, and I am content to see those who take <i>this</i> ground with me, that is, that the Lord has been dishonoured, though they condemn me in some of my acts.<a name=212:16></a> I have not for that given up my judgment as to the given case of evil at B.<a name=212:17></a> or elsewhere.<a name=212:18></a> The truth is, I think I see it more clearly, feel it more strongly, and have <i>increased vantage ground against it</i> of a holy kind by this humiliation.<a name=212:19></a> A rigid pride of righteousness as to it I believe does not become us; if any feel it their place to take this ground I am sure I do not take it with them, yet I think I am as decided, and I hope I shall be as firm in the long run as they.<a name=212:20></a> I think I have sometimes seen something of this spirit; I do not sympathise with it.<a name=212:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now my desire (led, I believe, of God) in the meeting was to separate this humiliation from everything else.<a name=212:22></a> I know of no <i>social</i> meeting together.<a name=212:23></a> This introduces the meals.<a name=212:24></a> I felt many might be disposed to fast: such was the case at Kingston.<a name=212:25></a> I further felt that in a meeting, professedly and solely for humiliation, dining socially together was much less in place than just taking what was needed in the way of food.<a name=212:26></a> Every family mourning apart [Zechariah 12: 12] shews not the letter but the spirit in which such an act may be looked at; and I decided to have no regular common meals, but let every one eat as his nature needed it before God; of course, several could together, if they were led to do it.<a name=212:27></a> The effect of this met at the same time a scruple which might be in many minds, and to avoid -- what might trouble them -- any recognition in worship, for so thanksgiving might be termed, of those who were walking, as they judged, disorderly.<a name=212:28></a> It would leave every one free to join where his own conscience was at ease; in a word, while I felt it in itself suitable, this arrangement left every conscience perfectly before God to do what it thought right.<a name=212:29></a> The eating makes no part of the meeting whatever; I have for the convenience of all provided for every one something to eat, that they may not have to go away to inns, or be hindered coming.<a name=212:30></a> I judge it will make the humiliation more solemn, and that I am very glad of.<a name=212:31></a> The humiliation is the sole object of the meeting.<a name=212:32></a> Of course, one who could not let into the humiliation he was engaged in, as regards the dishonour done to the Lord, another who desired it who was not decided as ourselves on what has occurred, could not join with comfort in the meeting.<a name=212:33></a> This leads me to the invitations.<a name=212:34></a> Unless in the case of known false doctrine, or such conduct morally as stopped my hand, I did not positively exclude individuals, or by any negative course which amounted to leaving them out.<a name=212:35></a> Their writing the bitterest things possible against myself would never have been a reason with me for excluding them, rather the contrary, that they might know personal injury did not weaken my charity .<a name=212:36></a>.<a name=212:37></a>.<a name=212:38></a> .<a name=212:39></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In fine, the meeting is neither social nor ecclesiastical, but of individuals who desire to humble themselves because we have not maintained the Lord's glory in what was committed to us, and nothing else.<a name=212:40></a> It is not about B.<a name=212:41></a>, nor about those who have separated themselves from it.<a name=212:42></a> I judge that great dishonour has been done to Christ, and a stumbling-block put in the way of souls finding their way out of surrounding evil.<a name=212:43></a> I put myself in the first place of guilt as to this.<a name=212:44></a> I meet those who desire to own we have not maintained God's glory in the exceedingly precious things committed to us.<a name=212:45></a> I have found some who have not been as decided about a certain evil as they ought to be, desirous of humbling themselves for what we are all concerned in.<a name=212:46></a> I take care they shall understand that there is no kind of compromise as to our decision as to this evil, and I am then willing they should humble themselves with us also.<a name=212:47></a> I have sought, not exactly to choose the individuals myself, but to take the best moral care I could that those should come who really joined in spirit in the humiliation.<a name=212:48></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		B. is not the subject of the meeting, but our having dishonoured God: such is the meeting.<a name=212:49></a> I understand that with some this sense of humiliation has not the place it has in my mind.<a name=212:50></a> Of course, they would not see the character of the meeting as I do; they may be more occupied merely with their own righteous ground as to B.<a name=212:51></a>: I do not sympathise with them.<a name=212:52></a> I think even great mistakes were committed by those who were right in the main, and that humiliation is the principal thing that becomes us; yet I think I see the evil of B.<a name=212:53></a> more clearly and more decidedly than ever: I am not going to make acting against it the spring of my action, but Christ.<a name=212:54></a> I think, as I have said, I get moral vantage ground as to it by the humiliation.<a name=212:55></a> I trust I have made clear to you the ground I have gone on as to the meeting.<a name=212:56></a> Of course, I may have made mistakes in the execution, but I feel assured God approves the object of it, and that He will guard it from any hindrance in the main to its object, which I believe to be dear to Him.<a name=212:57></a> It has this character of light at any rate, that it has brought out in a wonderful way the thoughts and state of everybody's heart.<a name=212:58></a> I shall lose the post if I add any more.<a name=212:59></a>

		DEAREST BROTHER, -- I am very thankful indeed you have been satisfied.<a name=214:1></a> I have no doubt the meeting will be a true basis of blessing, for example, the grace of God which gave it, and is connected with it.<a name=214:2></a> Many, at any rate, felt the Lord very decidedly giving His hand to help us out of a trying position, a fresh start in grace; I have no doubt of it.<a name=214:3></a> The Lord only keep us in the place in which humiliation brings us.<a name=214:4></a> Effects shewed themselves evidently in the hearts of several .<a name=214:5></a>.<a name=214:6></a>.<a name=214:7></a> .<a name=214:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The meeting referred, as I said, to our own failing, not to other people's; I am sure it did with me altogether.<a name=214:9></a> I feel on clearer ground as to it than ever I did, and relieved from the difficulty of dealing with evil in the condition of failure.<a name=214:10></a> We had a meeting afterwards at Bristol (not to mix it up with the Taunton one) where we were free to speak of matters.<a name=214:11></a> Then I took a step forward, delivering to myself, and removing a difficulty in others' way who complain of me.<a name=214:12></a> I declared I had entirely withdrawn my original letter as to B.<a name=214:13></a>; not that I saw anything wrong in it, only one passage had been complained of, that in which I said I could not break bread, etc.<a name=214:14></a> This I had put in as due to brethren, to tell them openly what I felt about it, instead of leaving them in the dark; it was openness and confidence towards them.<a name=214:15></a> But, while it took away what was a barrier to several, a grievance to all who object to me, so that they had spoken about it, I felt that it freed me from a perpetual formal question why I did this, and why I had not done that, and threw it over on the abiding merits of the case, and I drop out of the question, if there be any desire of approaching; if not, it is no matter.<a name=214:16></a> On the merits of the case I cannot have a doubt, and there the matter now stands, as far as I am concerned.<a name=214:17></a> There exists nothing between me and B.<a name=214:18></a> but its own state, and the pains I took to bring it before M.<a name=214:19></a> and C.<a name=214:20></a> in grace; nor, as regards others, have they this topic to dwell upon.<a name=214:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not think they were aware of what they wished; for the act, as far as my position is concerned, has the most complete and important bearing, but I had weighed it before the Lord, and declared definitively it was done.<a name=214:22></a> I was cross questioned and examined to know what I would do, but I refused peremptorily to commit myself to any course for the future.<a name=214:23></a> I was Christ's servant, and what was His will I should do, as far as grace enabled me, and I knew how.<a name=214:24></a> I felt that it broke the link with the old organisation of the brethren, if such I may call it.<a name=214:25></a> I had left that individually in leaving Ebrington Street, but the error having been generally rejected, that link was, in a certain sense, renewed by a circular to them all, and involved me in their position.<a name=214:26></a> Its withdrawal put me again completely free and isolated.<a name=214:27></a> I told the brethren that I had not a thought but through grace of having closer ties with those who walked in His fear, but the original link of association, the only ostensible one, was gone.<a name=214:28></a> I felt it delivered me from all link or discussion with gatherings, put B.<a name=214:29></a> out of court, and set me free in communion with brethren going right on the sole and simple ground of the unity of the church of God.<a name=214:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With them it will consequently bind the bonds tighter and on true and healthier grounds; while however free to act in grace towards any if occasion arise, as I heartily desire, I am free from all link with anything else; I am not involved in their responsibilities, as that letter implied, and what was urged as a stumbling block to others is gone.<a name=214:31></a> I am Christ's servant, untrammelled by aught save His will, which is true liberty.<a name=214:32></a> It astonished some of the brethren, but it was a settled thing in my own mind.<a name=214:33></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am prepared to suppose, unless God, who certainly is at work, prevent, and rise above it all in grace -- however clearly I explained it -- that many will take advantage of it to say I am changed, that I confess I was wrong, and see I was unjustifiable in my judgment as to B.<a name=214:34></a>; I am prepared for all this.<a name=214:35></a> I have to do with B.<a name=214:36></a> as a Christian now, and not to defend what I did then.<a name=214:37></a> I feel it a happier ground, though my object was to take what was alleged as a difficulty out of the way.<a name=214:38></a> They cannot complain now; the sole question is what are the real merits of the case.<a name=214:39></a> It has set my own mind abundantly free; I do not trouble myself the least with consequences drawn from it.<a name=214:40></a> It gives a new start, and gets rid of festering question and details.<a name=214:41></a> Others, I suppose, will tell you of the meeting, so I add no details.<a name=214:42></a> I felt at the end of the second day it was really closed, as did many others -- that its proper character of humiliation had; and though the evening of that day there was much spiritual energy, I believe it was beginning to merge, though there was confession, into rather more intercession for the future -- all most enjoyable in its place, but not our meeting.<a name=214:43></a> I believe the Lord ordered the whole.<a name=214:44></a>

		[G Gausby] [To the same.<a name=218:1></a>] DEAREST BROTHER, -- I think you misapprehend the disturbance of mind occasioned by the Taunton meeting; one or two have felt, and sought to produce it in others, but it has produced a great deal more peace than disturbance in the most, and I think only where people were absorbed by Bethesda, and as to that (without judging, I would trust) the Lord a little displaced by it.<a name=218:2></a> When I came over to England I assembled the brethren at Rawstorne Street, and told them I had done with it, and could not be for ever on questions, and desired to get on fresh with Christ, making a fresh start; that I did not make myself responsible for what had been done in my absence: it might have been much wiser than what I should have done, but being away I could not answer for it.<a name=218:3></a> And we have never been occupied with B.<a name=218:4></a> since, only taking up every individual on christian principles.<a name=218:5></a> Not that my or their principles were changed as to it in the least.<a name=218:6></a> It was a clear ground of judgment when any case arose involving it.<a name=218:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And now as to the meeting.<a name=218:8></a> The real difference is that your mind, as was -- 's, is much more absorbed with B.<a name=218:9></a> than mine.<a name=218:10></a> You speak of parties, and so on; my mind is quite off this ground.<a name=218:11></a> I believe that a testimony of God was confided to brethren in these latter days which they had to maintain in the unity of the church.<a name=218:12></a> God, I believe, has in no way given up this testimony, but I believe, brethren (we all) have grievously failed in maintaining it, and God's glory in it.<a name=218:13></a> This was a ground for humiliation, let B.<a name=218:14></a>, or Rome, or any other thing be what it may.<a name=218:15></a> As to confession, it was left to every one to acknowledge in his heart -- aloud, of course, if he thought right -- his own part in the bringing in the evil.<a name=218:16></a> The meeting was for humiliation, only so, that we might be in our right place before God.<a name=218:17></a> As to the causes, I, of course, did not prescribe the confession of any.<a name=218:18></a> But they date long before the B.<a name=218:19></a> affair.<a name=218:20></a> This was but a consequence, and it is just in owning ourselves the guilty party from previous failure, and thus getting right in our own place of humbleness before God, that He could help us as to any circumstances arisen since.<a name=218:21></a> To raise the question as to B.<a name=218:22></a> as some, as taking the clean place against the unclean, would have been to get out of our own proper place before God to take, in that by which God had chastened us, the place of righteousness.<a name=218:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Is it that my judgment is altered as to the cause of B.<a name=218:24></a>?<a name=218:25></a> Not at all.<a name=218:26></a> But I am outside and beyond that question.<a name=218:27></a> I am upon my own evil before God -- humbled because we have not maintained His glory.<a name=218:28></a> Each could in such case, if led to it, confess his own fault.<a name=218:29></a> It was an effect.<a name=218:30></a> The meeting was for humiliation.<a name=218:31></a> There were prayers that we might be led deeper into it, brought to know more fully our real place before God.<a name=218:32></a> Humiliation was the one object of the meeting.<a name=218:33></a> It was left to God to direct any particular confession.<a name=218:34></a> The ground of the meeting you state might be blessed is exactly what was taken, and I undoubtedly believe has been very greatly blessed.<a name=218:35></a> I look to its working effects individually, as God may own it.<a name=218:36></a> I think too this character was preserved, and God's power distinctly shewn in that.<a name=218:37></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>I have no old position whatever</i>.<a name=218:38></a> When I left Ebrington Street I stood alone.<a name=218:39></a> I walk with God's saints where I believe they are walking on His principles; and so far from the meeting putting me in the old position (save so far as it was abstractedly of God), that in its effect, though in itself it had nothing to do with it, the only link, which unawares to me connected me with the old position -- namely, my circular -- I have withdrawn.<a name=218:40></a> I have no more to say to B.<a name=218:41></a> than I have to Rome, and I feel that ground the happiest and the truest -- no more, save as positive acts may give occasion to judgment.<a name=218:42></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the evil, I am on no different ground than I ever was.<a name=218:43></a> If a thing is wrong and contrary to Christ it remains so, and I am under the same obligation to abstain from it and keep myself clear from it, and others, if I can, as ever.<a name=218:44></a> These things do not change.<a name=218:45></a> I may add, that evil doctrine was not the ground at any time of my dealing with B.<a name=218:46></a>: and I should not, on the other hand, have invited any in evil doctrine.<a name=218:47></a> But I deny most strenuously that division because of it has been the cause of the evil results.<a name=218:48></a> It is here that we are upon totally different ground, and that the real question as to the meeting is.<a name=218:49></a> I consider the B.<a name=218:50></a> matter, however sad their course, which I quite think, the cause of the sad results, and hence not that our faithfulness is the cause of what has arrived.<a name=218:51></a> Now I am not denying in a certain measure the faithfulness.<a name=218:52></a> But I look upon B.<a name=218:53></a> as a mere occasion in God's hands, for chastening us for our own previous unfaithfulness.<a name=218:54></a> Why did we fail rightly to judge and put away the evil?<a name=218:55></a> I admit brethren did.<a name=218:56></a> But how came this?<a name=218:57></a> Why did God permit them to be thus sifted by an evil they did not know how, had not the wisdom and courage, to deal with?<a name=218:58></a> Does God lightly and for no cause send such affliction and humiliation?<a name=218:59></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The incapacity of brethren was to me frightful and inconceivable as regards B.<a name=218:60></a> I think, seeing their state, they went wrong not because B.<a name=218:61></a> was right, but because they meddled with it out of their place.<a name=218:62></a> I begged them not, but they would not hear me.<a name=218:63></a> I could as to this take clear ground from all; but I go much farther back, and bow myself first of all for letting the evil come in -- failing myself -- of which I consider all this but the chastisement.<a name=218:64></a> When you speak of parties, and mutual humiliation, you are on a ground I know nothing about, and recognise nothing of whatever; because, as I said, you are occupied with B.<a name=218:65></a> as the one question.<a name=218:66></a> I have nothing to say to it, nor the meeting, save so far as historically it had become the occasion of sorrow.<a name=218:67></a> Individuals were invited; there was nothing mutual in this question that I know of.<a name=218:68></a> The only thing was to hinder consciences being so embarrassed as to prevent their coming.<a name=218:69></a> Individuals really concerned in the testimony brethren ought to have borne were welcome there, provided they came to humble themselves, and did nothing to shock the conscience of brethren, when judgment as to B.<a name=218:70></a> was distinctly resumed.<a name=218:71></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the conference: in the first place, the Taunton meeting is over.<a name=218:72></a> I should entirely decline mixing it up with any conference, whatever effect it may produce.<a name=218:73></a> I declined having the conference which was at Bristol at Taunton, that the Taunton meeting might fully preserve its own character.<a name=218:74></a> I should decline any ecclesiastical conference.<a name=218:75></a> If individual brethren wish either to open their hearts, or inquire even of the Lord what they ought to do, I have no objection.<a name=218:76></a> I shall take my part in it, if I can go on my own individual responsibility.<a name=218:77></a> I do not at present feel led to promoting such.<a name=218:78></a> I prefer letting the humiliation produce its natural fruits; and it has in those who took part in it produced such already largely, and certainly manifested the state of hearts in a wonderful way.<a name=218:79></a> Humiliation was our right place before God, and whenever we get into our right place before God He can bless, and delights to bless.<a name=218:80></a> It is possible a conference may have its place.<a name=218:81></a> It has seemed to me more the desire of anxious minds at present than of those quietly led by the Spirit of God.<a name=218:82></a> Does He lead us to it, I have no kind of opposition, and can conceive a state of soul in which it might have a very useful place.<a name=218:83></a> Souls are on the move, but under God's hand their competency to settle things I doubt.<a name=218:84></a> Forgive me, dear brother, if I think that at -- you have not adequately reached the just measure of want of confidence in your position.<a name=218:85></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Do I want you to doubt as to B.<a name=218:86></a> or any evil?<a name=218:87></a> God forbid.<a name=218:88></a> Quiet godly certainty as to it, I believe to be of the last importance, and especially in these loose and uncertain days.<a name=218:89></a> Or do I wish you to doubt the competency of God to help and direct His church were there but three met on earth?<a name=218:90></a> They might be a brighter testimony than three thousand.<a name=218:91></a> But I cannot help thinking that there was a confidence in your own position which does not reach the due extent of humiliation.<a name=218:92></a> Perhaps that arises partly from not having been mixed up with evil, which we who are older in this work have to mourn over.<a name=218:93></a> But so it is, there is an idea of competency to act with authority (not to be separate from evil -- all evil -- which is quite right), which I doubt that you can make penally good before God.<a name=218:94></a> Used for His glory He will bear with and bless you and purge out what there is of pretension in it, but He cannot approve and sanction the thing itself.<a name=218:95></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I repeat, as to our present question this may arise from your being never much in the position you have taken: a happy reason.<a name=218:96></a> Still it does not alter the great ground of the position brethren have to take before God.<a name=218:97></a> Brethren in general are quite outside these questions.<a name=218:98></a> I doubt that a conference got up as you wish would allay; I apprehend it would rather excite at this moment people's spirits, and much is passing at this moment that might impede its really occupying people's minds.<a name=218:99></a> They are occupied with other things.<a name=218:100></a> W.<a name=218:101></a> is withdrawing his papers, and has written to some as to the spirit in which he took things up.<a name=218:102></a> T.<a name=218:103></a> and W.<a name=218:104></a> are meditating withdrawing their circular, and stating on what grounds, though I have no particulars nor know whether they are decided.<a name=218:105></a> So that I should feel at this moment it would be the moment to wait awhile.<a name=218:106></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Further, I have made and know nothing of any compromise on anything, nor would not on principle on any moral subject whatever.<a name=218:107></a> Compromises are in my judgment always wrong.<a name=218:108></a> As I said, the mind of G.<a name=218:109></a> and yourself and perhaps one or two others (for there are only one or two, and some of those that assisted), have not seized the positive subject of the meeting from being occupied with your own point of view.<a name=218:110></a> No one there thought or dreamed of a compromise; such a thought never crossed any body's mind.<a name=218:111></a> But I do think the fault is in your position, not in that of the brethren who humbled themselves.<a name=218:112></a> I think there has been a tendency to an assumption of capacity of judgement, which God may own in its desire, but not in the wisdom of the position taken.<a name=218:113></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I thank you sincerely, beloved brother, for your letter, and, as you see, have answered openly and fully in all confidence.<a name=218:114></a> I quite believe the brethren who stayed away did it from a motive of conscience and a dread of compromising with evil, which I entirely respect and rejoice it was in exercise.<a name=218:115></a> I do not think that humiliation and a sense of failure had an adequate place in their mind; but some brethren I particularly value had scruples; some got over them, others did not.<a name=218:116></a> I do not blame one, quite the contrary.<a name=218:117></a>
	</div>

		[G Gausby] [To the same.<a name=223:1></a>] DEAREST BROTHER, -- Your letter gives little difficulty in answering, because as to its great principles it is quite what I feel myself.<a name=223:2></a> And I will add, as regards the Taunton meeting, the difficulty of acting in the Lord's mind as to humiliation, and yet keeping clear of evil ourselves there -- for that was the point -- was so delicate a one as to succeeding in practice, that had I not felt guided of God I should have felt it hopeless.<a name=223:3></a> And while I believe He graciously did help us, yet feeling it a very nice point to attain, not in principle but in practice (with one hundred and fifty people one could only, as to particular right estimate of the position and individual acts, in the main trust God that we should be kept), and earnestly desiring there should be no practical loosening of any separation from evil, I could in no way be surprised if persons felt scruples or difficulties as to the point reached; and their jealousy as to committing themselves to any compromise with evil I heartily sympathised with.<a name=223:4></a> Our affair was not to arrange communion, but to avoid any communion with what could affect the conscience as defiled, and yet have the humiliation on the ground you state.<a name=223:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I now turn to the difficulty you mention, as to Bethesda being on the ground of the Dissenters or the Establishment.<a name=223:6></a> This has been pressed much by persons who sought, while owning there was evil, to involve us again in looseness of fellowship with the principles of B.<a name=223:7></a> This is not your object at all, but your difficulty turns on the same point.<a name=223:8></a> But to me far graver considerations make a total and complete difference.<a name=223:9></a> There had been fellowship rightly or wrongly with B.<a name=223:10></a>, and the first question was, was it to be continued.<a name=223:11></a> That is, people had been received if they came thence, and brethren went there received in like manner.<a name=223:12></a> Subsequently to this, persons holding the most horrible doctrine as to Christ were received, inquiry refused, and the doctrine laid down and accepted by the body that no such inquiry should be.<a name=223:13></a> That is, they took as a body this position of unfaithfulness on foundation matters to Christ.<a name=223:14></a> The Establishment has not done this; indifference to persons holding a false Christ has never been proclaimed as its principle.<a name=223:15></a> Nor has any dissenting body that I know ever done so.<a name=223:16></a> This is the difference then to me, a grave positive sin against Christ, the body having accepted this as a principle.<a name=223:17></a> Where a dissenting body has done this, I would not receive its members, unless the individual were cleared of the sin.<a name=223:18></a> Nor can I consent to set ecclesiastical faults of judgment (however grave as regulating my conduct in connection with the unity of the body) on the same ground as positive indifference to what concerns the personal glory of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=223:19></a> An Independent goes ecclesiastically wrong; when he comes to me, though inconsistent perhaps through want of conviction, he goes ecclesiastically right; but as to Christ's personal glory, and the foundation of union, he is perhaps as jealous as I am, and, it may be, more faithful.<a name=223:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Supposing now B.<a name=223:21></a> unfaithful, for I am only shewing the difference of principle -- supposing they are as regards the Person of the Lord Jesus, I am, in receiving one who forms part of it, acquiescing in this sin, which is in no sort cleared by his coming amongst us, but rather acquiesced in by us.<a name=223:22></a> Fidelity to the truth as to Christ's Person is in question in one case, and not in the other.<a name=223:23></a> Now, this is a difference <i>all-important</i>, which is <i>before all unity</i>, and at the foundation of all unity too.<a name=223:24></a> To hold unity independently of it is to put the church -- that is, unity of men -- in place of Christ, not to build it on Him.<a name=223:25></a> To me this is as clear as the sun at noonday, and I believe it to be a question of the <i>value we have for Christ</i>.<a name=223:26></a> If persons say we are now separated for good, and have nothing whatever to say to B.<a name=223:27></a> as being outside the pale of Christian unity, I should have no objection to examine each case, provided the sin in which they have been implicated be inquired into and pressed, and continuance in it taken account of -- in a word, that indifference to Christ be in no way accepted or acquiesced in.<a name=223:28></a> That is the whole matter with me; though I think there are other grave points in the B.<a name=223:29></a> case, all fade to my mind before this.<a name=223:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would not on any account have invited one whom I knew to be in false doctrine to Taunton; one case when I feared it might be, I took particular pains to guard against any mixture with it.<a name=223:31></a> I do distinguish between persons actually deliberately guilty of the sin, and persons, through not knowing what to do, or prejudice, or ecclesiastical difficulties, not cleared from ecclesiastical connection with it, though they would abhor it in itself.<a name=223:32></a> I certainly would not have invited a person I supposed to be deliberately and unrepentingly guilty of it.<a name=223:33></a> It was proposed to me to have it open to them, and I declined.<a name=223:34></a> Two courses were open -- excluding B.<a name=223:35></a> as a body by name, or inviting individually on some well-known principle (not of course on private choice).<a name=223:36></a> I first thought of the former, and finally acted on the latter, but in a way I believed to be effectual, and which was carried into effect on the same principle which would not let in those who held to the sin.<a name=223:37></a> Without, of course, pretending that all was perfect on these points, still careful godly pains were taken to maintain the fear of God, and certainly our gracious God watched over the matter for us.<a name=223:38></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Some I might not shake hands with, others I should; I cannot lump all together in the same moral judgment.<a name=223:39></a> I see scripture teaches me in certain cases when I condemn, not to treat as an enemy, but admonish as a brother.<a name=223:40></a> This is the ground I publicly took on returning to England.<a name=223:41></a> I believe I am on right ground, and I must deal with each case individually.<a name=223:42></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have been interrupted and distracted in every possible way while writing this letter, but I trust I may have conveyed the point of my thought.<a name=223:43></a> If you have any difficulty, I am sure you will kindly write again.<a name=223:44></a> The whole question with me is, the real faithful maintaining as far as in us lies, the glory of the Lord Jesus, for its own sake, and as the basis of union.<a name=223:45></a>

		Dearest G V Wigram, -- As to -- 's paper, his statements as to the double object of the epistle are good and useful, but on chapters 8, 9, 10 he is, I think, without bottom in his argument.<a name=228:1></a> He does not descend in the class nor character of priesthood; he sometimes urges Hebraizing Christians not to go back, and sometimes to advance.<a name=228:2></a> The importance of the remark is this -- that he supposes a different kind of Melchisedec priesthood coming out for future time (applicable to such a state or class) distinct from His going in as Melchisedec; the Son now, Christ may have a priestly character as Melchisedec in the world to come, of a modified character in its exercise, and this may serve as a link in the apprehension of it.<a name=228:3></a> But He is never seen as coming out in the Hebrews.<a name=228:4></a> In chapter 9 which he refers to, in verse 24, He is gone in.<a name=228:5></a> He does apply it to the passing away (chapter 8: 13), but the priestly place is the same as in chapter 13, only there he applies it to the further point of their leaving Judaism entirely, which was passing away.<a name=228:6></a> So that we have the contrast of earthly and heavenly, the passing away of the old, the advancing into the new, eternal and heavenly, and the actual leaving the old before it passed away, or was publicly judged here below.<a name=228:7></a> But whatever suggestive links we may gain, the coming out Melchisedec which he supposes is not in the Epistle to the Hebrews, but solely the going in Melchisedec in every part of it.<a name=228:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another mistake, I think: "Compassed with infirmities" is not, as he supposes, applied to Christ, but to the Jewish priest who is such <i>while he is</i>.<a name=228:9></a> Christ was not a priest at any rate <i>till He had left His humiliation</i>.<a name=228:10></a> He is quite right as to his contrast of "taken from among men," only he has not carried it far enough.<a name=228:11></a> "Maintain failure" is incorrect, I though I understand it -- maintain failing saints he means.<a name=228:12></a> His point is not stated with sufficient clearness for many to get into any difficulty by.<a name=228:13></a> And I do not deny that as Melchisedec, He is the surety of a better covenant, and still is so on high, and thus a link of truth is gained; but He is that as going in, not as coming out, in which character He is never seen in Hebrews.<a name=228:14></a> The Epistle is not putting any on millennial ground, but taking them off old covenant and putting them into the heavenlies, and nowhere else.<a name=228:15></a>

		[G Gausby] [To the same.<a name=232:1></a>] DEAR BROTHER, -- I feel your course and steps to be of great importance in this matter at this moment, because it may give an impulse to a most useful means of helping in spiritual truth and development those who labour; and hence every step should be taken, looking earnestly to God that He may guide it.<a name=232:2></a> As to time, I will accommodate myself to brethren or the times of their leisure.<a name=232:3></a> I am in Ireland, and hope somewhat to go to Clonmel, Kilkenny, Athlone, and the north.<a name=232:4></a>

		I should think you had better, while earnestly begging God to order this, invite speedily as many from perhaps a smaller circle than sixty miles, at once those <i>entering on the work</i> or entered -- if some cannot come, fill up by enlarging the circle still with workmen, asking some older students to help in the study.<a name=232:5></a> I should suppose inviting the active workmen around, and older workmen whence you felt disposed.<a name=232:6></a> There is no idea of exclusion, but of nearer neighbourhood, and some more distant to help in the study.<a name=232:7></a> It ought to be <i>bon fide</i> study, or not so private.<a name=232:8></a>

		As to Rosh (Ezekiel 38: 2), I do not see the force of the argument.<a name=234:22></a> If Ezekiel prophesies that the prince of Rosh, Meshech and Tubal shall come up to Palestine in the latter day, I do not see what the origin of the name of Rosh has to do with it.<a name=234:23></a> If Cush or Phut is to suffer in Egypt, or in the lower Euphrates, what matters it where the point of their first migration was from?<a name=234:24></a> The prince of Rosh may have sprung from the Northmen, and acquired power over Meshech and Tubal, and Persia be at his steps.<a name=234:25></a> How do the Russi, coming from Scandinavia or the Cimbrian Chersonese, hinder that?<a name=234:26></a>

		[From the French.<a name=235:1></a>] Mons.<a name=235:2></a> Eynard, The principle of Hebrews 13: 17, to which I would add 1 Thessalonians 5: 12-13, and 1 Corinthians 16: 15-16, is more important in our day than ever, because regular authority, established by the apostle and armed with his sanction, no longer exists.<a name=235:3></a> There is only one thing which modifies the application of it, that is that the care contemplated in these verses is so extended generally in practice, that it has not the same hold upon the conscience.<a name=235:4></a> Then, on the other hand, God permits the jealousy of the clergy, that plague par excellence of the church, the great barrier to the progress of souls.<a name=235:5></a> It opposes itself to the progress which is necessary for their deliverance from the influences of this present age, and from the principles which are carrying on the external church in the way of destruction which will be accomplished in the last days.<a name=235:6></a> However this may be, if you examine the effect of a clerical position, you will find souls stunted, scarcely any spiritual development or intelligence in the ways of God.<a name=235:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards the moral condition of individuals, I believe that it consists, in many cases, in despising the influence that God grants to services rendered to His church by the power of the Spirit.<a name=235:8></a> But, as soon as this influence is placed between the action of the conscience and God, the clerical principle is established, and moral declension begins.<a name=235:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The relation of individual conscience with God is the great and true principle of Protestantism, no doubt greatly lost now, in that which has come in.<a name=235:10></a> It is not the right to judge for oneself, as is said, but the direct connection of the conscience with God.<a name=235:11></a> "We ought to obey God rather than men.<a name=235:12></a>" Man has not the right to judge, but neither has he the right to interpose himself between God and man, so as to intercept the direct action of God on the conscience.<a name=235:13></a> The ordinary interpretation of this principle of Protestantism is the root of Rationalism; the denial of this same principle, taken in its true sense, is Popery.<a name=235:14></a> Real intercourse between God and the soul preserves the Christian from each of these errors.<a name=235:15></a> As long as there is only man, there is but place for one or the other of these two things, because it is only man that is in question.<a name=235:16></a> If God enters upon the scene, there can be neither one nor the other, because God is there.<a name=235:17></a> But, in order that it may be so practically, we must be kept in His presence.<a name=235:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When the conscience is before God, we are individually humble, and, for this very reason, recognise God in others: when will acts, we reject God in His own Person as well as in others, and that is what is evil; it is also what the apostle had in view in the above exhortations.<a name=235:19></a> When the influence of true ministry is in exercise (and it is of great price), it is gentle as the relations of a nurse with her child, as Paul said; the more so that spiritual power, acting in personal devotedness, is but little manifested now as in the cases indicated by the apostle.<a name=235:20></a> It also supposes a workman made "manifest to God," and consequently to the consciences of those in the midst of whom he acts.<a name=235:21></a> I have never seen, when such a person acts, and his action flows from much communion with God, that this influence, this moral authority, has not been recognised.<a name=235:22></a> Moreover, such a workman is not, in this case, carried beyond what he has received from God, so that his ministry finds its sanction in hearts without any pressure.<a name=235:23></a> There are, however, cases where things go on badly, and the workman is put to the test.<a name=235:24></a> In such a case he must keep before God, and act solely for Him; he must be at the service of Christ, and commit the result to Him alone.<a name=235:25></a> The Lord will always keep the upper hand; and in the end, if patience has her perfect work, the wisdom and justness of the judgment of the person who has acted will be made plain.<a name=235:26></a> Without having sought it, his authority will even be much increased by it, though perhaps he may, in appearance, have entirely lost it.<a name=235:27></a> But for this, one must know how to act with God.<a name=235:28></a> I speak of what happens, and of the principles which are connected with this question.<a name=235:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I find that in these times the principle of these passages renders them of great price, because it is a question of a kind of authority that no condition of the church can weaken.<a name=235:30></a> All other authority might be lost, this will but shine the more.<a name=235:31></a> It is exercised by the direct action of the Spirit of God in service.<a name=235:32></a> Besides, he who seeks this authority will not have it, while he who, in heart and by the love of Christ acting in him, makes himself servant of all, as Christ has done, will obtain it.<a name=235:33></a> To be servant of all is what Christ is essentially in grace -- it is what love is at all times.<a name=235:34></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another kind of authority.<a name=235:35></a> Christ exalted on high may institute apostles to represent Him officially; these may institute other servants to exercise a delegated and subordinate authority, each in his sphere.<a name=235:36></a> That has taken place.<a name=235:37></a> In the passages with which we are occupied, the apostle speaks of another kind of authority.<a name=235:38></a> He does not speak of that which represents Christ seated on the throne, regulating the official order of His house, but of that which represents Christ, a servant in love.<a name=235:39></a> May this be my portion!<a name=235:40></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, in the present state of ruin and scattering of the church, this latter authority, which is acquired by service in love, is of great price; but it is evident that it is exercised in conditions of devoted service, of humility and of a nearness to Christ, such as excludes all other influences, and makes us act solely from Him.<a name=235:41></a> As to the measure of the confidence granted, it is a question, as in every other case, of spirituality.<a name=235:42></a> Through indolence, the flesh places confidence in the flesh.<a name=235:43></a> The soul is not then before God.<a name=235:44></a> Walking after the Spirit, I am before God, and I have the consciousness that there is more spirituality, more that is of God in another, and I recognise these things.<a name=235:45></a> This never stifles spirituality in me, and cannot stifle it, for it is the same Spirit who produces spirituality in the labourer and in me; only it enlarges my spiritual capacity, as to the fact which is realised, and raises it to the height of him who has more of it.<a name=235:46></a> A lower degree of spiritual intelligence and affection in one Christian can discern that which is more excellent in another, and accept it, when will does not work; although he would not have been able himself to make the discovery of such or such a course of action, proposed by greater spirituality and greater love than his.<a name=235:47></a> As I said at the time at Geneva: the waggoners know if a road is good and well laid down, and they know how to use it; but only the engineers knew how to plan it and lay it down.<a name=235:48></a> Now the presence of God in the church comes to our aid, and regulates everything, when the difficulty appears otherwise insurmountable.<a name=235:49></a> God is there for this, and He suffices for it.<a name=235:50></a> If the assembly has too little spirituality, if will acts with such force that one cannot follow out what one knows by <i>divine intelligence</i> to be the will of God, one has only to commit the thing to God, and wait for Him to manifest His will, or to manifest Himself, to put others in the right way.<a name=235:51></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not speak of that which demands absolute separation.<a name=235:52></a> When an assembly positively accepts an evil which the Spirit of God could not suffer, God will make good His rights in favour of what He has given.<a name=235:53></a> We must commit ourselves to Him for this.<a name=235:54></a> I believe that the confidence of a simple soul, and its submission for conscience, not to man as man, but to the manifestation of God in man, is one of the sweetest and most profitable things possible.<a name=235:55></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The difference between the influence of true ministry, and that of the clergy, who have borrowed the name, is as clear and simple as possible.<a name=235:56></a> Ministry presents God to the soul, and places it in His presence.<a name=235:57></a> It desires to do this, seeks to do it, hiding itself in order to succeed.<a name=235:58></a> The clergy places itself between God and the soul, and seeks to keep its position before souls.<a name=235:59></a> Every spiritual soul will clearly discern its place.<a name=235:60></a> It finds God in the one case; in the other, it sees Him despised and set at a distance, in order that the usurped influence of man may be exercised.<a name=235:61></a>

		My Dear G V Wigram, -- I am at length free, and the Lord willing, start on Monday for Frankfort and Switzerland.<a name=242:9></a> I thought to have gone through Siegerland, and seen the brethren there, but my time would have been so short that I should have had no satisfactory visit, and I had not even time to warn those some way off that they might come.<a name=242:10></a> I had an opportunity of preaching to a large assembly of strict Baptists, who are dreadfully under the law -- the first time I spoke in a large company of strangers.<a name=242:11></a> They were assembled from all sides on Easter Monday, and the Lord was gracious, and I was able to set a full gospel before them, forgetting the assembly, and only thinking of the Lord's love in His work.<a name=242:12></a> The attention of a vast number was something remarkable; one saw they had never heard a simple gospel -- it is law and experience.<a name=242:13></a> Some older hands were equally visibly uneasy.<a name=242:14></a> And German came, thank God, in full flow.<a name=242:15></a> I hope the truth may have remained in many; through grace, at any rate, the testimony was important, and went to a large number, so that they knew what it was.<a name=242:16></a> I have been happy in the work in neighbouring places lately, and I hope there has been blessing.<a name=242:17></a> One very interesting man out here has found peace a few Sundays ago, and having an active mind searches all out -- already has found the cross through it.<a name=242:18></a> His testimony has been nice and faithful.<a name=242:19></a> He has taken no decided outward step, but sees the Establishment impossible to remain in.<a name=242:20></a>

		[From the French.<a name=243:14></a>] Without having anything very new, I have much enjoyed and, I hope, profited by the Word.<a name=243:15></a> The Psalms have formed the subject of our intercourse, and a number of passages, here and there, have assumed more force and clearness in my mind.<a name=243:16></a>

		I have been a good deal struck with the effect of the judgment-seat of Christ on Paul.<a name=243:17></a> He sees all its terror, but the only effect is to induce him to persuade others.<a name=243:18></a> The Christ before whom he would appear was his righteousness, and judged according to that righteousness; thus there was no possible question.<a name=243:19></a> That which judged and that which was before the judgment-seat were identified: this was one side of the truth of the nature of God; the other side is love.<a name=243:20></a> Now it is this latter alone which, in consequence, is set in activity: he persuades others on account of this terror.<a name=243:21></a> I know few passages which more forcibly set forth the power of the gospel and the perfection of justification.<a name=243:22></a> But there is a precious operation of this judgment-seat: the apostle realised his appearing before Him; he did not fear to be manifested in the future, he was, in fact, manifested to God; conscience, perfectly purified relatively to God, assumed all its sway, and being kept in the presence of God, all that was not according to that presence was, in fact, manifested in the light.<a name=243:23></a> This was necessary, and, through grace he had the light of God to shew, to give the consciousness, that there was nothing.<a name=243:24></a> It is very important to be there; many things are judged there which often are not judged in a tolerably well-regulated christian life; and when conscience is before God, and clear, love is free.<a name=243:25></a> In this way we know also what it is to be always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal bodies; or rather walking thus, one is capable of being, one is fully in His presence.<a name=243:26></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Among other things, I have also been struck with chapters 15 and 17 of Genesis.<a name=243:27></a> It seems to me that the disinterestedness of Abraham, at the end of chapter 14, was the reason of God's saying to him in grace, "I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.<a name=243:28></a>" At first sight one might have thought that Abraham would have nothing to do but to rejoice with ineffable joy at the thought that God Himself was his reward; but he says, "What wilt thou give me?<a name=243:29></a>" God condescends in grace, when it is a question of a real need founded on promise.<a name=243:30></a> But there is an element which stamps its character upon that grace: "I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward;" the blessing does not go beyond the personal needs or privileges of Abraham.<a name=243:31></a> Quite naturally his heart enters into this, and it is the development of the need of his heart according to its own state.<a name=243:32></a> It is immense grace, but grace which, in a certain sense, is measured by the needs of the creature.<a name=243:33></a> In chapter 17 God says, "I am the Almighty God.<a name=243:34></a>" He does not say, "I am thy .<a name=243:35></a>.<a name=243:36></a>.<a name=243:37></a> " It is what He is in Himself: "walk before me, and be thou perfect" (upright).<a name=243:38></a> Abraham falls on his face, and God talks with Abraham.<a name=243:39></a> He promises him the son, and afterwards reveals to him, as to a friend, what He is about to do.<a name=243:40></a> Then Abraham, instead of making requests for himself, intercedes for others.<a name=243:41></a> It may also be remarked that chapter 15 does not go beyond Jewish promises; in chapter 17 he is the father of many nations.<a name=243:42></a> It is the difference between the goodness of God, which is connected in grace with us and our needs, and communion with Him.<a name=243:43></a>

		As to 1 John 1: 1, for a time, but long ago, I thought as you do, and it is impossible to separate the pre-existence of the divine nature in a person.<a name=247:35></a> However, I think that in saying, "That which is from the beginning," the Spirit speaks of what Jesus was on earth, of what John had seen and handled.<a name=247:36></a> In the Gospel, "in the beginning," relates to the whole previous existence of God, that is to say, the phrase states the eternal existence of Christ as the Word.<a name=247:37></a> John's great subject is the manifestation of God, and of divine life on earth.<a name=247:38></a> To this end, he speaks of the eternal Word, and of His incarnation; but in the Epistle he goes on to the reproduction of this life in us, and with this object he traces up this life in us to its origin and to its perfect manifestation -- what Christ was on earth.<a name=247:39></a> Chapter 2: 7 seems to prove that this is the force of the passage.<a name=247:40></a> In these days, when people will have something more perfect than Christ, it is not unimportant to insist on that which was from the beginning.<a name=247:41></a>

		I have been struck latterly with the three characters of experience, or of the action of the Spirit of God, in Philippians, 2 Corinthians and 1 Corinthians.<a name=247:46></a> In the first, the soul raised above everything, can do all things, always rejoices, is troubled about nothing, does but one thing, knows not whether it is better to live or to die.<a name=247:47></a> In the second, he despaired of his life; when he arrived in Macedonia, he had no rest; without were conflicts, within were fears.<a name=247:48></a> But in the first case he rested on Him who raiseth the dead; in the second, God comforts those who are cast down; thirdly, he glories in his infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon him.<a name=247:49></a> In a word, it is power and divine consolation when one is pressed down by difficulties.<a name=247:50></a> In 1 Corinthians the Christians were in a very bad state: he reproves them sternly, but begins by saying, "God is faithful, who will confirm you to the end, that ye may be irreproachable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=247:51></a>" What grace in all this!<a name=247:52></a> And this has done me good, and I have found it instructive.<a name=247:53></a>

		Dear G V Wigram, -- I do not think coming forth from the bosom of the Father scriptural.<a name=249:1></a> The reason seems to me evident, because the expression is used to express a present apprehension of His love and favour which depends on His being in that place.<a name=249:2></a> To come forth from it would be at best the thought of memory, and this is evidently much stronger; it is the present being in, and in the enjoyment of, what the phrase expresses.<a name=249:3></a> He came forth from the Father and into the world, and left the world and went to the Father, but never, I think, is it said from His bosom.<a name=249:4></a> But it is evidently to express an idea like Abraham's bosom in another order of ideas, not a physical fact; and man, in expressing the love and joy He left for us, may have used it in a certain sense harmlessly, namely, with right affections, though not quite accurately seizing the force of the expression in John 1: 18.<a name=249:5></a> I may have done so myself, for aught I know.<a name=249:6></a> Coming forth from the Father is the <i>point de dpart</i>, not the intimacy of affection and position.<a name=249:7></a> Hence we have the only-begotten Son, He who concentrates in His own Person all the affection of Him in whose bosom He is.<a name=249:8></a>

		As regards oJ w[n ("who is"), it is, I doubt not, somewhat emphatic, but too much must not be ruled on it.<a name=249:9></a> The participle is used with article, or it is left out, in many cases without much difference of sense; toi'" aJgivoi" ejn jEfevsw or toi'" aJgivoi" toi'" ousin ejn jEfevsw is pretty much the same: oJ w[n by itself is the name, I am; still I think as w[n is not necessary, the subsistence and existence of Christ in this position, its being a part of that existence and subsistence, is intimated, as it might be supposed He had left it; for oJ eij" to;n kovlpon could be very well said, and I do not believe the Holy Ghost has put the w[n there for nothing.<a name=249:10></a> But it is more its being constant and essential than its being divine that is intimated, though to be essential and constant it must be divine.<a name=249:11></a> I do not think it is a question of doctrine, but the force of the expression is lost if we speak of coming forth from -- namely, leaving it in a certain sense.<a name=249:12></a> Christ's being in the bosom of the Father is of so much the more importance, that He declares the Father's character as He thus knows Him.<a name=249:13></a> The importance of this is increased by 1 John 4: 12 .<a name=249:14></a>.<a name=249:15></a>.<a name=249:16></a> .<a name=249:17></a>

		As regards death in creation before man's fall, I must remark that probably the question only refers to death in this earth's state as it is since Adam's creation.<a name=249:23></a> Since man's creation, I am quite satisfied that death never took place till his fall.<a name=249:24></a> "By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin, and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.<a name=249:25></a>" Now here the apostle is occupied with sin's effect upon man; still he states that death entered by sin.<a name=249:26></a> Hence I conclude that death was not in the creation of which man was the head until his fall.<a name=249:27></a> But of what may have happened between the creation of the heavens and the earth (bara) and the forming the present world out of chaos, scripture says nothing, but leaves us to gather rather that the state of the world, the tohu bohu ["without form and void"], was the ruin of some previous state; for I hardly think that the state in which God would create it, and make all the sons of God shout for joy.<a name=249:28></a> Hence if geologists find Megalotheria, and Plesiosauri as many as they please, they do not touch the statements of scripture one way or another, for scripture makes none as to it: only into the creation connected with man, death entered by man's sin.<a name=249:29></a> That scripture states, though it does not touch on its consequences for beasts; but Genesis 1: 30 confirms, for it gives the green grass to the beasts of the earth.<a name=249:30></a> I know not whether -- is aware of the discoveries of geologists and the use made by infidels of it on the point in question.<a name=249:31></a> Scripture decides as to the present state of the world in which man is found, and says nothing as to what preceded it.<a name=249:32></a>

		The supposition you speak of, that an awakening revived for the time, shews the soul to be in a young state, and to have judged itself but little; because nothing but the daily exercise of faith in Christ, a constant sense of dependence and active seeking from and intercourse with Christ, can keep the soul in a good state -- humble, dependent, in the sense of God's presence, and the joy of His love, and in an atmosphere into which sin does not come.<a name=256:21></a> "He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him," and "He that eateth me even he shall live by me.<a name=256:22></a>" With, I should trust, as deep an interest in the work as any, I cannot say I felt any excitement.<a name=256:23></a> But I apprehend our work through grace is not to blame or hinder, but to seek to help in prayer, and, according to the gift given to us, to care for these souls, to deepen and complete the work, to work for Christ in it -- to look for deeper conviction, but specially to connect Christ with the state of their souls.<a name=256:24></a> But here exactly is the difficulty of the case; because the fact that the conscience has not been deeply affected, leaves the heart more to its own feelings and occupied with them, and makes Christ less precious and important to it when the feelings wane.<a name=256:25></a> The soul has a sickly life thus.<a name=256:26></a> But then we depend on grace, on grace in Christ, and in ministering patiently Christ, the soul perhaps passing through a crisis of doubt or a fall, finds His value, and is settled in Him.<a name=256:27></a>

		Though I have had no details, nor desire to have them, I am aware of the efforts and attacks directed against me.<a name=256:28></a> There is a kind of instinct which shews you them.<a name=256:29></a> I have no wish to be insensible to them, but I am through grace in blessed peace about them and everything.<a name=256:30></a> One can by faith carry everything to God, and all is peace.<a name=256:31></a> First, as to outward things, I have never had such good meetings, both in France and Switzerland, and the Lord so sensibly with His poor servant in speaking.<a name=256:32></a> And if it were God's will that men should cover me with infamy -- if it be His will, I should be unspeakably happy in it, because it was His will.<a name=256:33></a> Perhaps many would not understand me, but when one is more with God, joy becomes boundless.<a name=256:34></a> It is not, of course, that I should seek it, I need not say, nor that the thing is not disagreeable; but, in the measure in which it is, one's joy is more entirely with God; and His will is always right, so that one has not to reason about it, but to leave it to Him.<a name=256:35></a> As to those who act in it, I have only as to myself to wait and seek to act rightly if they cross my path.<a name=256:36></a> Thus I leave it, in all peace.<a name=256:37></a>

		[G Gausby] [To the same.<a name=258:1></a>] BELOVED BROTHER, -- I received your letter on my arrival here, and thank you much for it.<a name=258:2></a> The Lord's gracious hand is most evident with our beloved brother.<a name=258:3></a> He has been most gracious also in Switzerland.<a name=258:4></a> He alone knows whether all effort is closed on the part of the enemy, but He has wrought so graciously hitherto, that one ought not to doubt a moment His goodness.<a name=258:5></a>

		As regards your own path, beloved brother, I think I can enter into it, but there is a God above all adverse circumstances and undesirable influences.<a name=258:6></a> And our path for power is in letting patience have its perfect work.<a name=258:7></a> Our casting things on God has a wonderful retroactive power on our own souls, in breaking down will and what in us cannot link itself with the divine nature.<a name=258:8></a> The signs of an apostle were wrought in all patience.<a name=258:9></a> We are subjects in many and even in all cases, where we think ourselves agents; and where hindered evidently so.<a name=258:10></a> Besides that, there is a positive bearing on God's part wonderful in comparison with what (alas!<a name=258:11></a>) is often the measure of our faith.<a name=258:12></a> Trust Him.<a name=258:13></a> He has power to work where we least expect it.<a name=258:14></a> In those Swiss affairs I was only ashamed for not having asked more, so wonderfully did He grant all I asked Him for.<a name=258:15></a> But it is according to His will.<a name=258:16></a> Our will must not be at work.<a name=258:17></a> Hence let patience have its perfect work, that ye may be perfect and complete in all the will of God.<a name=258:18></a> It is important that we should feel, that faith may be in exercise -- or rather that is faith -- that not only God is great and glorious, and able to help and love, but that He has linked His glory in love with His saints.<a name=258:19></a> This is a most precious truth; when I can say, He (Christ) is glorified in them, I can ask confidently.<a name=258:20></a> See Moses, "Thou hast brought them out of Egypt.<a name=258:21></a>" This makes, no doubt, EVIL intolerable in the saints for the same reason; brother, friend, neighbour, become intolerable in the degree of their nearness when God is dishonoured in them, viewed as wilful in the evil.<a name=258:22></a> But the bright side is, that with God we can use all that they ought to be in Him and that His love can make them, as pleas with Him; but then we must be separated from self in it -- and when not, and for that, patience comes in as between ourselves and God in self-judgment.<a name=258:23></a> Besides, the saints, however foolish, are very dear to God.<a name=258:24></a> But I must close.<a name=258:25></a> Peace be with you, dear brother.<a name=258:26></a>

		[T Smith] BELOVED BROTHER, -- .<a name=260:1></a>.<a name=260:2></a>.<a name=260:3></a> It is so true that we have all grace in our living Head, and I do pray that we may be enabled in holding fast the Head, to draw continually thence, and to be preserved from what would hinder the life of that blessed One in our mortal bodies.<a name=260:4></a> When we think what it is to have such a life and such a fulness to draw from, and that really we are to enjoy all that that supplies in God's own presence, in the light in heaven, it gives a thanksgiving and a steadiness of joy, that the Holy Ghost alone can give or make us understand.<a name=260:5></a> But we have to seek that there be an exercised spirit, that our living and habitual state may be according to this.<a name=260:6></a> Christ was not always in the glory of the transfiguration.<a name=260:7></a> He met and felt an unbelieving world; but He was always consistent with the glory which that revealed, and indeed with what was only dimly shadowed there, and that in every spring of action and manifestation in life; and in us this must be sought to be realised in them.<a name=260:8></a> It is not an effort to copy (though we do copy) but to be, or rather so to draw from the Head, that what we are in Him be not hindered in its manifestation by evil.<a name=260:9></a> To overcome, we need power as well as the desires of a new nature; hence constant dependence, not uncertainty as to the nature and life which desires, but dependence for force or power on Another for the accomplishment (I mean here below) of those desires.<a name=260:10></a> It is the difference of Romans 7 and 8.<a name=260:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another point I will mention, as I have been led to this, that all proper and happy affections suppose the relationship to which they belong, not merely the nature capable of them.<a name=260:12></a> An orphan has the capacity of loving a father and mother, and it makes it unhappy.<a name=260:13></a> A child who has its parents has the affections which belong to this relationship.<a name=260:14></a> So the existence of the divine nature involves the desires natural to it; spiritual affections have their place in known relationship with the Father and with Christ; and this is founded on redemption and grace, which must be known as an assured thing, accomplished, and indeed the relationships into which we have been brought by it, in order that these blessed affections which flow from a known God exist in our souls.<a name=260:15></a> But then what a sure and immutable source of happiness we have -- divine and immediate nearness to God!<a name=260:16></a> He has adopted us to Himself as children (see Ephesians 1), and given a nature capable of enjoying it, and the Holy Ghost as power (unlimited in itself), and that based on a redemption which places us fully in unclouded favour and fully known love, exercised and accomplished towards us in it, in a position as assured as the value of the redemption itself -- eternal redemption.<a name=260:17></a>

		The Lord keep us in His peace, and walking before Him in all holy conversation and godliness, that we may meet in unfeigned joy.<a name=260:18></a> Adieu, dear brother.<a name=260:19></a> The Lord our gracious Master be with you and near you, and all His beloved people, and deign to keep me also.<a name=260:20></a> I have been these latter times in general very happy with Him, but it has been with a look into the blessedness before me in His presence, which has made me feel how little one sees into it as one ought, though at the same time how great it is; but it is a wonderful light into which one is permitted to look; I speak of the happiness of His presence in light.<a name=260:21></a>

		[From the French.<a name=266:26></a>] -- - As to the Epistle to the Philippians (in reading you may judge of this), the christian life recognises nothing but the fruit of resurrection, because we ought to walk according to the Spirit, and never according to the flesh.<a name=266:27></a> God is faithful, not to suffer us to be tempted beyond our strength.<a name=266:28></a> The Christian is considered as walking always according to the Spirit, and reckoning himself dead to sin, but alive to God.<a name=266:29></a> Then there is, "My grace is sufficient for thee; my strength is made perfect in weakness.<a name=266:30></a>" If we pretend to the absence of the flesh, or that we have not to take any notice of it, or if we pretend that we have not to judge ourselves inwardly, we are mistaken; and, even if we are sincere, there remains a mass of subtle things unjudged, and the general state of the soul is below the true effect of the light of God.<a name=266:31></a> But the strength of God is with us, to make us walk in communion with Himself.<a name=266:32></a>

		As to the passage in John 21: 18, I do not think that the Lord points out in Peter an evil will.<a name=266:33></a> He had desired, that is to say, of his own will, to follow the Lord.<a name=266:34></a> He had to learn his powerlessness, because there was will in him, human strength; but at the end of his life it would not be so; another would gird him, and he should go where he would not.<a name=266:35></a> There is no question here of an evil will, but it would not be his will which would gird him, or cause him to die.<a name=266:36></a> He could, without doubt, bless God for it; but he did not seek to suffer.<a name=266:37></a> I am the more convinced that this is the sense, because the Lord adds, "This he said, signifying by what death he should glorify God.<a name=266:38></a>" What Peter had to learn at that time, and what the Lord taught, was that the will of man could effect nothing in the pathway of life through death, and that is the only way of life.<a name=266:39></a>

		[E Meylan] [From the French.<a name=267:1></a>] DEAREST BROTHER, -- I was glad to have even a few lines from you, the more so because you tell me a little about the beloved brethren in Switzerland.<a name=267:2></a> I am beginning rather to want to see them, but I am waiting for the guidance of God.<a name=267:3></a> I had so long neglected England that I was somewhat their debtor; and our God, in His great goodness, has not left His blessing to be waited for.<a name=267:4></a> Our conferences have been singularly happy, and blessing is not wanting to the work in general.<a name=267:5></a> The number of brethren is increasing, and the meetings, on the whole, are in peace; where there is anything unpleasant it is rather that God is delivering them from a condition of feebleness in which evil was hiding itself, in which the water was stagnating to some degree.<a name=267:6></a> Here in London conversions are frequent, and many souls attracted.<a name=267:7></a> What I fear is that too external a work may be doing; still the consciences and hearts of brethren are well exercised, which is a very good sign, and there is a good spirit.<a name=267:8></a> I hope that God will cause those most recently converted to reach this exercise of soul, so that they may gain in depth, as they have rapidly gained the assurance of salvation.<a name=267:9></a> As to the rest, the work is a work of God, and His Spirit must accomplish it, a work of life in the soul which is settled in real -- and thus, blessed be God for it -- eternal relationships with God.<a name=267:10></a>

		Dearest G Gausby, -- I read -- 's letter before yours, and I was going to say to you that I could not judge it honest.<a name=268:1></a> I looked at one paragraph (the first is quite right) and it seemed to me at first sight somewhat obscure, but I will examine it carefully when I have a moment.<a name=268:2></a> As to the doctrine, I need not hardly say that I abhor it, and judge that he who <i>wittingly</i> holds it has a false Christ -- but one has to be careful even as to words.<a name=268:3></a> I have no doubt as to the doctrine I desire to teach.<a name=268:4></a> A question came from Manchester, and the answer to holding Mr.<a name=268:5></a> Newton's doctrine will appear, written before I received yours.<a name=268:6></a> -- is the more evidently on false ground, as Mr.<a name=268:7></a> Craik wrote the other day (I read the letter) that he was not aware of a single person at Bethesda who would consider Mr.<a name=268:8></a> N.<a name=268:9></a> a heretic in the ordinary sense of the word.<a name=268:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Affectionately yours.<a name=268:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My letter having been delayed, I have been able to read through the articles.<a name=268:12></a> The doctrine is quite right, and the very opposite of Mr.<a name=268:13></a> N.<a name=268:14></a>'s, but not perhaps clearly brought out.<a name=268:15></a> It is carefully stated that He always says "Father," in contrast with the atoning work, in which He speaks of being forsaken.<a name=268:16></a> He was enjoying the relationship of a Son with the Father.<a name=268:17></a> In the passage itself it is clearly said that Christ <i>entered into it</i> for them at the close, afflicted in all their afflictions.<a name=268:18></a> The essence of Mr.<a name=268:19></a> N.<a name=268:20></a>'s doctrine was that He was born under it Himself, and <i>escaped</i> much of it.<a name=268:21></a> Here Christ is entering in grace into it at a given time, when God's time was come.<a name=268:22></a> I have no doubt that on the approach of the cross, when His ministry was ended, He entered into a new character of suffering in which the power of Satan was to be all exercised against Him in view of death and judgment, which was not before -- he had departed from Him for a season; that He viewed this death, though not yet actually in it, as the judgment of God against sin, and thus entered into Israel's sorrow of the last day; that what He saw in it was the hand of God stretched out on Israel; that this was connected in His mind with the rod of God upon them, and that this closely connected itself with His coming death and their sins, but He was not then bearing them.<a name=268:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The fact is rightly stated: what is not unfolded is the way He entered into them; but I have distinctly stated -- though of course, in the case of Christ, they were not His own personally, and that He entered into the sufferings for them, afflicted in their afflictions, but -- that the relationship of a Son with a Father who was always heard, He was always in the enjoyment of, till the cross.<a name=268:24></a> The way the cross is connected in this Psalm with sufferings, not atoning, is of the deepest interest, though it was the time as a whole that atonement was going on; in which the judgment of God, the hostility of man, and the power of Satan -- all were against Him.<a name=268:25></a> Though the act of atonement was only His drinking the cup on the cross, yet who can doubt that in Gethsemane He was looking at God's hand in judgment, and took the whole of what He was then delivered up to in all its details as coming from His hand, whoever was allowed to do it.<a name=268:26></a> God had now shewed Him that He must suffer: He walks as the smitten One in thought, does not answer, recognises it as the hour of the power of evil (which it was not before).<a name=268:27></a> He is to be reckoned according to God's counsels with the malefactors, delivered up to the Gentiles, and His perfection is that He takes up this from God's hand, and will from none else.<a name=268:28></a> "Thou hast lifted me up and cast me down.<a name=268:29></a>" (Psalm 102.<a name=268:30></a>) Man, then seeing Him thus given up to it, adds every insult and wrong to His sorrow.<a name=268:31></a> They are the things done in the green tree, the true vine -- what in the dry?<a name=268:32></a> Christ's entering graciously, voluntarily, and yet obediently into this place of sorrows, and subjection to the power of evil, when the time of God's will was come, is exactly the opposite of His being born under it, and escaping it by piety.<a name=268:33></a> But it is not the atoning work, nor was it the serving in active love to reveal the Father's name.<a name=268:34></a> He was going through conflict of a new character before He actually drank the atoning cup.<a name=268:35></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Note, too, that under the government of God is not distance from Him -- a most important and essential difference.<a name=268:36></a> My mind is so totally on another ground from Mr.<a name=268:37></a> N.<a name=268:38></a>'s, that all the terms which are connected with it are not before me.<a name=268:39></a> So far from its being distance, that it is said in this passage that even in Gethsemane He does not say "My God;" it would have been out of place, because it was not the expression of the unclouded relationship and conscious blessedness of sonship in which the blessed Lord always stood.<a name=268:40></a> <i>On the cross</i> God was dealing with Him about sin.<a name=268:41></a> Now all this, which is part of the passage, is in direct antagonism with all Mr.<a name=268:42></a> N.<a name=268:43></a>'s doctrine.<a name=268:44></a> The only thing I see is that it is not fully explained <i>how</i> He entered into it, though the alleged way -- Mr.<a name=268:45></a> N.<a name=268:46></a>'s -- is positively denied in the passage.<a name=268:47></a>

		Dear G V Wigram, -- The Observations on the Psalms<a href="#271:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> are not so precise as the Synopsis, but there is more freshness in them (this at least), so that I enjoyed it more when I read it.<a name=271:1></a> The essential difference is that many more Psalms are applied to Christ in the Observations than in the Synopsis, as is habitually the case.<a name=271:2></a> In the Synopsis the remnant is much more prominently brought into view, and I think rightly.<a name=271:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to Psalm 31, the remark<a href="#271:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a> that "it is not expressed in the historical order," is the key to what is said.<a name=271:4></a> His whole life is viewed as to position, but the close is seen first, as stamping its character upon His sorrows (not atonement).<a name=271:5></a> He was isolated, hated, etc.<a name=271:6></a>, but His mind, as being perfect, saw not merely the fruit of faithfulness, which is not the subject of this Psalm, though He were faithful in everything, but that the Israel whom He had taken up in grace had to come into judgment.<a name=271:7></a> Prophetically the shadow of the cross was cast upon His life, as I doubt not He often in fact anticipated it.<a name=271:8></a> His communion with God was perfect with respect to these very things.<a name=271:9></a> We have an example in "Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say?<a name=271:10></a> Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.<a name=271:11></a> Father glorify thy name.<a name=271:12></a>" Only I doubt not He often felt what the place of Israel was according to God; but as long as He lived, that is, till the last entry into Jerusalem, it was still open to the people to repent.<a name=271:13></a> It is closed by "Now are they hid from thine eyes.<a name=271:14></a>" Still I doubt not He often, nay always, saw where all was going as to Israel, and felt it in perfect communion with God.<a name=271:15></a> This breach was sealed on the cross besides the atoning work.<a name=271:16></a> There He took His place under it for the purpose of atonement, but He saw it as the full rejection of Israel too.<a name=271:17></a> His rejection, which He felt all through, was really Israel's rejection.<a name=271:18></a> And He could say, "If thou hadst known, at least in this thy day, but .<a name=271:19></a>.<a name=271:20></a>.<a name=271:21></a> "
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the comment on the Psalm supposes that the full result is prophetically here seen, and the circumstances leading to the crisis there gone into taking their colour from the crisis, but their colour to His spirit in full communion with God.<a name=271:22></a> So that words of deep comfort flow from this depth of communion, and perfect thoughts in the trial for those who have to go through the experience of it, in a measure at least, hereafter.<a name=271:23></a> Verse 22 shews the full agony of Gethsemane (compare Psalm 103) casting its shadow on the whole; but the circumstances are from without, which are felt, as in verses 4, 9, 10, 11, etc.<a name=271:24></a> I think it is more critically exact to begin from the remnant, but the deepest profit, at any rate, is seeing the blessed Lord entering into it.<a name=271:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let no one fear that is N.<a name=271:26></a>'s doctrine: not only is it not, but <i>he says</i> he does not mean this, and puts his views in contrast with it; and so it is, he wholly <i>excludes</i> this.<a name=271:27></a> If his be true, this would have been impossible.<a name=271:28></a> He holds Christ was by faith associated with the ungodly Jews.<a name=271:29></a> I teach how He was the blessed Son of God, in perfect communion, and entering as a faithful One into the sorrows of the godly remnant.<a name=271:30></a> Only seeing that for them and to deliver them, there must be a rejection of the nation, and of Messiah as connected with it in flesh, to have it on a new ground -- the sure mercies of David, thus proving resurrection.<a name=271:31></a> I do not expect many at once to enter into this.<a name=271:32></a> The sympathies of Christ they will feel, His atonement they see with thankfulness for themselves, His own sorrows they but little enter into, but that does not make them the less precious, if we can.<a name=271:33></a> "If ye loved <i>me</i>, ye would rejoice, because I said I go unto the Father.<a name=271:34></a>" But to me, this sorrow of Christ is very clear in scripture.<a name=271:35></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to Psalm 61, there is no ground for the question: none surely ever felt our sins as Jesus did, their horribleness in God's sight, how they separated from God, our ruin by them.<a name=271:36></a> That is not the same thing as bearing them.<a name=271:37></a> He groaned deeply in spirit, He groaned in Himself at seeing the power of death at the tomb of Lazarus.<a name=271:38></a> That was not bearing them, or meeting wrath for them.<a name=271:39></a> This surely is very simple.<a name=271:40></a> I dread extremely the sense of Christ's sufferings, the sorrows of the blessed Lord being weakened by the deadly doctrine which the devil has raised up to make them not such at all, but a relationship with God that made Him feel them <i>for Himself</i>.<a name=271:41></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I hope I have made it clear: if not, you can let me know.<a name=271:42></a> The thirty-first a man must be spiritual to understand: what is said as to Psalm 61, it seems to me any one might who knows what Christ's sympathy means.<a name=271:43></a>

		[E Meylan] [<i>From the French</i>.<a name=274:1></a>] BELOVED BROTHER, -- .<a name=274:2></a>.<a name=274:3></a>.<a name=274:4></a> My stay in Switzerland was a time of trial; I felt on arriving that it was God's will that I should take the journey, and that I had done well to come, but it was nevertheless a time of trial; but God is above everything, and in His goodness He makes all contribute to the blessing of those who love Him.<a name=274:5></a> My spirit is replenished in His goodness, for whilst having entire confidence in His goodness by faith, or as to my faith, in my mind I felt at Lausanne that it was a time of obedience, not of the activity of the Holy Spirit in my heart; but there is a time for everything, and God is good in everything.<a name=274:6></a> I had been so abundantly blessed in former times that perhaps God thought fit to put me into winter a little, and to make me feel my dependence on Him, which, however, I did not question.<a name=274:7></a> I was rather afraid that my translation might not be the best thing to do.<a name=274:8></a> I did not know exactly why God kept me thus.<a name=274:9></a> The enemy sought to discourage me; faith in the unfailing goodness of God sustained me, but it was only faith.<a name=274:10></a> Now I am happy; though still a prisoner, I am not suffering, but I have not yet regained strength for work.<a name=274:11></a> I believe that the sight of my right eye has improved; I work at home, through the goodness of God.<a name=274:12></a> My journey was particularly happy, thank God: I felt it was a serious thing in the midst of work evidently blessed to be stopped, perhaps for ever.<a name=274:13></a> Greet the brethren warmly.<a name=274:14></a> May God bless yours.<a name=274:15></a>

		[<i>From the French</i>.<a name=275:1></a>] -- - The Epistle to the Philippians has somewhat occupied me of late.<a name=275:2></a> What has struck me particularly in this epistle is, that the apostle so places himself in the life of Christ, that he expresses no consciousness of the existence of the flesh.<a name=275:3></a> He had a thorn in the flesh, so that it is not a question of doctrine only, it is a state in which the flesh does not act, and cannot lead the thoughts astray; that which appears to be a success for Satan will turn to salvation for Paul.<a name=275:4></a> Christ will be glorified in his body, whether by life or by death, as He had always been.<a name=275:5></a> To live is Christ, nothing else; to die, gain, for he will enjoy Christ without hindrance.<a name=275:6></a> He decides his own trial, without regard to himself, for he knows not what to choose; but for the church it is well that he should remain, so he will remain.<a name=275:7></a> He is careful for nothing.<a name=275:8></a> He knows that peace of God which passes all understanding -- he, who was going to stand on his trial before Nero.<a name=275:9></a> He knows how to be abased, and how to abound.<a name=275:10></a> He can do <i>all things</i> through Christ, who strengthens him.<a name=275:11></a> He is, by that which belongs to the life of Christ, above it all.<a name=275:12></a> He has not, without doubt, attained to the end, namely, resurrection from among the dead, but he does only one thing -- the activity of the life of Christ leaves no room for anything else.<a name=275:13></a> The more you examine the epistle, the more you find that, during the life in which he has not attained to the end, he knows no other thing than "to live is Christ.<a name=275:14></a>"

		C H Mackintosh, Some news of the work going on in the north, and now at Coleraine, has reached me.<a name=275:16></a> You will not be surprised if I write a line, not surely as wiser than any, but having the matter at heart.<a name=275:17></a> It is a great thing to see by most holy watchfulness that Satan does not get in, and the flesh under him imitating the working of God; this I had upon my mind as wishing to write.<a name=275:18></a> Such a work (it is really always so) is out of our hands where it is real, but one watches responsibly through it, though of the last importance to serve God and His work, and leave the manner in which He pleases to work to Himself; but to own Him thus, it just gives us the title to watch all that in it is of Him.<a name=275:19></a> If I doubt His title to work as He sees fit, I am not of His mind, I thwart His Spirit and lose the power.<a name=275:20></a> Where I own and bless Him as above me and above all, I can for Him be jealous that nothing dishonours Him, and watch all fleshly excitement and discredit it because it is not God.<a name=275:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I remember in Wesley's time they used to be seized with a kind of convulsion in the meetings, and fall down.<a name=275:22></a> Some caught this, perhaps some imitated or let themselves go to it.<a name=275:23></a> He said, the first person who fell down he would have turned out, and no more did so.<a name=275:24></a> It was well meant, doubtless, but I doubt the rightness.<a name=275:25></a> It were better to judge the false thing, if we could, and leave all divine action free.<a name=275:26></a> I admit the difficulty of this; we shall not always be right, but in owning God and doing it for Him He will help us through.<a name=275:27></a> Let godliness be a great test, sober judgment of self be a fruit; the authority of the word meets the conscience when the flesh begins to appear, generally under pretence of being above and without it -- yet not at first expecting intelligence.<a name=275:28></a> When the first action by power on the conscience takes place, you must expect feelings to have the upper hand at the moment, and after forgiveness to have the [exercises] in the heart over the means of being forgiven.<a name=275:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But if there be genuine conviction of sin, the work and Person of Christ will have their value when presented, and feelings will give up to this when more reflection and sober action comes in.<a name=275:30></a> Jesus Himself will attract, and His promises of forgiveness -- His work will gradually acquire due proportion in the soul as it gets on.<a name=275:31></a> Yet we have to follow rather than lead where God is working, and only watch the progress, and minister the word as wants arise.<a name=275:32></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Above all (I need hardly say), dear brother, pray much that God may help you, and hold in grace fully the upper hand, for you must expect excitement.<a name=275:33></a> But through grace and nearness to God, do not let yourself be excited.<a name=275:34></a> Peter's sermon was very sober on the day of Pentecost, being after a time of much prayer.<a name=275:35></a> Sober and earnest truth from God to them under the work, deep truth for the conscience -- I do not speak of knowledge, but deep in the weight of God's presence, for it is a solemn thing that He should be so near to us, and a good thing.<a name=275:36></a> But He should be nearer to us in secret than even this wonderful action, and then all will be well.<a name=275:37></a> My prayers mount up for you and all those wrought on, that God will keep the work; it is His own and in His own hands.<a name=275:38></a> Seek nothing -- I am sure you do not -- for a party in any sense.<a name=275:39></a> It is not that I doubt the truth of a divine path, but God works now, and the true path is to make Christ everything.<a name=275:40></a> God is working much in many places in these last days.<a name=275:41></a> Satan is also working.<a name=275:42></a> Our path is holding forth the word of truth, the immediate presence of God, which will be a light through it all.<a name=275:43></a> We know who will have the upper hand; also flesh will be sifted, and in the activities of God will be brought to light and judged.<a name=275:44></a> Peace be with you, dear brother, and grace and wisdom from God.<a name=275:45></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards Apocalypse 7, I have for years considered it the most difficult portion of the Apocalypse.<a name=278:5></a> But the great tribulation is not my difficulty.<a name=278:6></a> Chapter 3: 10 I think explains that.<a name=278:7></a> The great tribulation of Matthew 24, Jeremiah, and Daniel 12, is confined to Jacob and Judaea.<a name=278:8></a> The great difficulty for me is "before the throne.<a name=278:9></a>" (Vers.<a name=278:10></a> 9, 15.<a name=278:11></a>) Were it not for one passage, I might freely take it morally, not actually.<a name=278:12></a> The English translation increases the difficulty: "dwell among them," is not in the passage (verse 15), but "tabernacle over them," as the cloud did Israel.<a name=278:13></a> But the temple in no way sets them in heaven.<a name=278:14></a> In the holy city there is no temple.<a name=278:15></a> It is not the character of heavenly worship to worship in the temple.<a name=278:16></a> You will remark, they are not round about the throne, but before it.<a name=278:17></a> If in chapter 14: 3 a[[dousin be applied to the 144,000, "before the throne" applies to those on earth; but in chapter 4: 5-6 we have it applied to part of the furniture of the temple above.<a name=278:18></a> That they are not the church is to me clear.<a name=278:19></a> They are contrasted in their whole condition with the elders; they are saved by Him that sits on the throne and the Lamb, which connects them with the time of introductory government -- though not of the millennium; they give no motive for their praise -- a mark of the saints who are properly heavenly; their blessings are relief from sufferings, or being led by shepherd's care to food and refreshment; their relationship with God as before the throne takes them out of association with it -- the true character of the strictly heavenly saints.<a name=278:20></a> Even the angels are round about the throne -- not so these.<a name=278:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I certainly think they are separated pre-millennially -- are in relationship with God on the ground of the place He takes as introducing the only-begotten into the world -- of His throne above, but before He has introduced Him.<a name=278:22></a> Hence they pass through the time of temptation which shall come upon all the world.<a name=278:23></a> I do not see that the object is to state earth or heaven, but the character of relationship, and that as the elect perfect number of Israel would be saved, so there would be a multitude of Gentiles spared in the time the throne of God held its place on high, and the Lamb was yet there.<a name=278:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But that those who are thus spared have eternal life as supposed by your inquirer, says absolutely nothing of the multitudes that come into existence during the millennium.<a name=278:25></a> So that the difficulty as to the rebels at the close does not exist.<a name=278:26></a> The great tribulation here spoken of is in no way confined to the Roman earth.<a name=278:27></a> I know of none which is particularly applied to that.<a name=278:28></a> But there are persons spared -- those associated with idolatrous Jews, whom the Lord judges at His coming.<a name=278:29></a> The sun not smiting them would tend to prove they are on the earth.<a name=278:30></a> Unless the army of the beast (Revelation 19), I know of no objects of judgment of which a remnant is not spared.<a name=278:31></a> The wine-press may distinctively mark this, and Edom involved in it.<a name=278:32></a> To those who have not received the love of the truth who have it, strong delusion will be sent to believe a lie, that they all might be condemned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.<a name=278:33></a> I can hardly think the dragon, beast, and false prophet do not assemble their subjects to Armageddon -- but I suppose rather that it is a general assembly of all.<a name=278:34></a>

		[<i>From the French</i>.<a name=279:1></a>] DEAR SISTER, -- The questions you ask me make me feel deeply how sorrowful are subtle questions upon the Person of Jesus; they tend to dry up and confuse the soul, to cause the spirit of worship and of love to be lost, and in its place to put intricate questions, as if the mind of man could resolve the way in which the humanity and divinity of Jesus are united.<a name=279:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is in this sense that it is said, "No man knoweth the Son save the Father.<a name=279:3></a>" (I need not say that I do not pretend to do so.<a name=279:4></a>) The humanity of Jesus is incomparable.<a name=279:5></a> His was a true and real humanity; body and soul, flesh and blood, like mine as far as humanity is concerned, sin excepted; but He appeared in circumstances quite different from those in which Adam was found.<a name=279:6></a> He came for the express purpose of bearing our sorrows and infirmities.<a name=279:7></a> Adam had none to bear: not that his nature was not in itself susceptible of them, but he was not in the circumstances which entail them: God had placed him in a position which could not be reached by physical evil until he had fallen under moral evil.<a name=279:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, God was not in Adam; God was in Christ amid all kinds of misery and suffering, weariness and trial.<a name=279:9></a> Christ passed through them according to the power of God, and with sentiments of which the Spirit of God was always the source, although they were human in their sympathies.<a name=279:10></a> Adam, before his fall, had no suffering; God was not in him, nor was the Holy Spirit the source of his sentiments; after his fall, sin was the source of his sentiments; it was never so in Jesus.<a name=279:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On the other hand, Jesus is Son of man, Adam was not; but, at the same time, Jesus was born by divine power, so that that <i>holy thing</i> which was <i>born of Mary</i> is called Son of God: this is true of none other.<a name=279:12></a> He is Christ born of man, but even as man born of God, so that the condition of humanity in Him is not that which Adam was, either before his fall or after his fall.<a name=279:13></a> Now humanity for Adam was not changed by his fall, but the condition of humanity; he was as much a man before as after, after as before.<a name=279:14></a> Sin came in, and humanity became alienated from God: it is without God in the world.<a name=279:15></a> Now it was not thus with Christ.<a name=279:16></a> He was always perfectly with God, save in suffering on the cross in His spirit the forsaking.<a name=279:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Also, the Word was made flesh; God has been manifested in flesh.<a name=279:18></a> Acting thus in that veritable humanity, His presence in the unity of the same Person was incompatible with sin.<a name=279:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are mistaken if we imagine that Adam had immortality in himself; no creature possesses that; they are all maintained by God, who alone has immortality essentially.<a name=279:20></a> When it was no longer God's will to maintain it in the world, man became mortal, and his strength in fact wears out, according to the ways and the will of God; when such is God's will, he has a life of more than a thousand years -- only three score and ten when He thinks fit.<a name=279:21></a> It is God's will that life should come to a close, that we should die, sooner or later; except those who shall be alive at the coming of Jesus, who shall be changed, because the Lord has vanquished death.<a name=279:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now God was in Christ, which changed everything; but not with respect to the reality of His humanity, with all its affections, its sentiments, its natural needs of soul and body, which were all in Jesus, who underwent consequently the effect of all that surrounded Him, only according to the Spirit, and without sin.<a name=279:23></a> No man takes His life from Him, He lays it down, but He does this when the moment appointed by God was come.<a name=279:24></a> In fact, He gives Himself up to the effect of the iniquity of man, because it was the will of God that He came to accomplish.<a name=279:25></a> He allows Himself to be crucified and put to death, only He is master of the moment in which He yields up His spirit.<a name=279:26></a> He works no miracle to hinder the effect of the cruel means of death which man was using, or to screen His humanity.<a name=279:27></a> He leaves it to the consequence of those means.<a name=279:28></a> His divinity is not used to screen Him from it, to screen Him from death, but to add all its moral value, all its perfection to His obedience.<a name=279:29></a> He works no miracle that He may not die, but He works a miracle by dying.<a name=279:30></a> He acts according to His divine prerogative in dying, but not in screening Himself from death, for He commends His spirit to His Father as soon as all is finished.<a name=279:31></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The difference then of His humanity is not that it was not really and fully that of Mary (surely it was), but in that it was that by an act of divine power, so as to be such without sin; and further, in that instead of being separated from God in His soul, as every sinful man is, God was in Him, and He was of God.<a name=279:32></a> He could say, "I thirst;" "now is my soul troubled;" "it is melted like wax in the midst of my bowels;" but He could say, "The Son of man who <i>is</i> in heaven;" and "Before Abraham was, <i>I am</i>.<a name=279:33></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The innocence of Adam was not God manifest in flesh; it was not man subjected, as to the circumstances in which his humanity was placed, to all the consequences of sin.<a name=279:34></a> On the other hand, the humanity of fallen man had fallen under the power of sin, of a will opposed to God, of desires hostile to Him.<a name=279:35></a> Christ came to do the will of God, and in Him was no sin.<a name=279:36></a> That was humanity in Christ, where God was; not humanity in itself separated from God.<a name=279:37></a> It was not humanity in the circumstances in which God placed man when He created him, but in the circumstances in which sin had placed Him, yet in those circumstances without sin; not such as sin made him in them, but such as divine power made Him in all His ways, such that the Holy Spirit was expressed in humanity in the midst of those circumstances.<a name=279:38></a> It was not man where there was no evil, like Adam, innocent, but Man in the midst of evil; yet it was not sinful man in the midst of evil like Adam fallen, but Man perfect, and perfect according to God, in the midst of evil -- God manifest in flesh; a real, true humanity; but His spirit having always the sentiments which God produces in man, and in absolute communion with God, except when He suffered upon the cross, when it was necessary, as far as the sufferings of His soul were concerned, that He should be forsaken of God -- more perfect then, with regard to the extent of the perfection and the reach of obedience than at any other time, because He was doing the will of God in the face of His wrath, instead of accomplishing it in the enjoyment of communion with Him.<a name=279:39></a> This is why there, and only there, He asked that that cup might pass from Him.<a name=279:40></a> His sustenance could not be found in the wrath of God.<a name=279:41></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Our precious Saviour was Man, as truly as I am, as regards the simple abstract idea of humanity, but without sin, miraculously born by divine power; and more than this, He was God manifest in flesh.<a name=279:42></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, having said so much, I entreat you with all my heart not to try to define and to discuss the Person of our precious Saviour; you will lose the savour of Christ in your thoughts, and you will get in its place only the barrenness of the human mind in the things of Christ, and in the affections which belong to them.<a name=279:43></a> I have begged the brethren to refrain from this, and they are all the better for it.<a name=279:44></a> It is a labyrinth for man, because he works from his own resources.<a name=279:45></a> It is as if one were to dissect the body of one's friend, instead of delighting in his affections and his character.<a name=279:46></a> In the church, it is one of the worst signs I have met with.<a name=279:47></a> It is very sad to get into this way, very sad that this should be shewn in such a light before the church of God, and before the world.<a name=279:48></a> I would add, that so deep is my conviction of man's incapacity in this matter, and that it is outside the teaching of the Spirit to wish to define the manner of the union of divinity and humanity in Jesus, that I am quite ready to suppose that even while desiring to avoid it, I may have fallen into it, and thus may have spoken in a mistaken way in something which I have said to you.<a name=279:49></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That He was truly Man, Son of man, dependent on God as such, and without sin in that condition of dependence -- truly God in all His ineffable perfection: this I hold, I trust, dearer than life.<a name=279:50></a> To define everything is what I do not presume to do.<a name=279:51></a> "No man knoweth the Son but the Father.<a name=279:52></a>" If I find anything which weakens one or the other of these truths, or which dishonours Him who is their subject, I shall oppose it with all my might, as God may call me to do so.<a name=279:53></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		May God grant you to believe all which the word teaches with regard to Him -- Jesus.<a name=279:54></a> It is our food and sustenance to understand all which the Spirit has given us to understand, and not to seek to define that which God does not call upon us to define, but to adore on the one hand and to feed upon on the other, and to love in every way according to the grace of the Holy Spirit.<a name=279:55></a><br>1859.<a name=279:56></a>

		Beloved Brethren, -- I have learned by a providential circumstance that it is the purpose of our dear brother -- to propose a common day of fasting and humiliation as to the state of the saints.<a name=283:3></a> I feel deeply, indeed, I have in my little manner acted on it when I could, that the very thing that is called for, and urgently called for, is fasting and humiliation, and deep, deep humiliation before God, as I know the beloved saints have already done so in several places.<a name=283:4></a> Hence on the mere point of so fasting I say nothing, believing that it must be left to the Holy Ghost to guide the saints, as He sees good, to such a service.<a name=283:5></a> But what I feel bound to lay before them is this.<a name=283:6></a> When a common fast is proposed, it supposes of course a common object.<a name=283:7></a> All I think the saints would be wise to learn before undertaking to <i>join</i> in such a thing, is, what the common thing they join in is.<a name=283:8></a> Further, when we join in a common thing, we more or less identify ourselves with those with whom we join.<a name=283:9></a> In the present state of things, I would only suggest to the brethren not to commit themselves to anything they are unacquainted with.<a name=283:10></a> My own judgment is that some of the fasts at Plymouth (and I was at one of them myself, so that it is not to blame individuals) were by very far the worst things which have been done there before God -- very, very far.<a name=283:11></a> This judgment of course I do not press on the brethren; I only suggest to them that, if a <i>common</i> fast is proposed, they should at least learn what the common thing is.<a name=283:12></a> I have no doubt what is done truly before the Lord, even in ignorance, will be blessed to those who do it in the end; but we act with power when we act with the knowledge of His mind.<a name=283:13></a>

		[R Chapman] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- Being ignorant of the circumstances which have passed, you cannot of course tell to what tests charity may have been put.<a name=284:1></a> Still, love is of God, and God is love; hence I trust that it will surmount, in virtue of its divine nature, and through divine power, everything; and indeed so thank God, I have found it.<a name=284:2></a> Still, the love of God, though rising over and covering everything because of its own fulness, and that it owns Christ in the saints, and our own nothingness, is not, dear brother, a blind and unintelligent feeling.<a name=284:3></a> I do earnestly desire the church's, rather the saint's humiliation for the divisions and state it is in generally.<a name=284:4></a> And I earnestly desire the Lord may be with the beloved ones at -- .<a name=284:5></a> In uniting in a matter of the kind, what I feel we have to do is to see the mind of the Holy Ghost, and how far Christ is leading in it.<a name=284:6></a> I earnestly desire the common fellowship of the saints in humiliation.<a name=284:7></a> Still, as to this particular case, I apprehend I am not wrong in connecting it with the circumstances of the present time, and a certain spiritual judgment of the state of things here (or what may be connected with it).<a name=284:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now to look really and unfeignedly for a <i>common</i> supplication, if unity in judgment of the remedy be not demanded, at least, the sense of the evil which we have to present to God must be the same, or we shall not be presenting the same spiritual groan to God at all.<a name=284:9></a> The common act would be hypocrisy, though each might be unfeignedly sincere for himself.<a name=284:10></a> Now I may tell you, dear brother, that it was the judgment of several spiritual and intelligent saints (not of us of Plymouth) that the ground you took would aid greatly, or at any rate would aid, in increasing the spiritual delusion and blindness under which many beloved saints were labouring here.<a name=284:11></a> Such, I do not doubt, was the fact, though individual grace will always be overruled for blessing; and hence I fully trusted the Lord about it, assured that He would overrule it for blessing.<a name=284:12></a> This will probably little affect the certainty you have that you are right, but this will hardly govern other people.<a name=284:13></a> It is a question merely whose spiritual judgment is the soundest: both may be partial, and both used by supreme divine wisdom for the bringing about His own purposes; though, while God uses both, they cannot actually go together.<a name=284:14></a> Hence, while I am sure all the love which shall be in exercise in your meeting will be most surely blest to those who are there (and I trust to others), and indeed all there is of right spiritual judgment, and my heart would go unfeignedly along with it; still, it could not formally, while ignorant of the mind in which it was done, join in what it did not even know -- could not, in the sense of possibility.<a name=284:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If there were the recognition of certain things, and state of things -- of this of course I cannot speak -- then I could not in good conscience before the Lord have anything at all to say to it.<a name=284:16></a> It would be both hypocrisy and a positive disobedience and departure from God.<a name=284:17></a> My judgment is definite and assured, I believe; and I have no doubt that I have it from the Lord.<a name=284:18></a> I dare not, nor would I, of course, depart from it.<a name=284:19></a> Any charge of want of charity to which I may render myself liable, would not turn me away, because there is a day coming when every one will receive praise of God.<a name=284:20></a> I am content to wait for that, though indeed I have not had to wait for it, through abounding and undeserved grace which thinks of our weakness.<a name=284:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to our course, dear brother, I have no doubt at all (though admitting many imperfections in the way) that it has been of God.<a name=284:22></a> We (that is, those who have come out and met faithfully in our weakness) have found so distinct and unequivocal a testimony to His favour and approbation, and such an evident and sensible blessing, that we have been confirmed in the strongest possible way in that which we have done in faithfulness to God.<a name=284:23></a> We are content with His portion, whatever men may judge of us.<a name=284:24></a> For my own part, now twenty years that I have been converted, I never experienced so distinct a deliverance of God, nor so sensible a consciousness of the blessing and joy of spirit by the Holy Ghost which accompanies walking in His will.<a name=284:25></a> I had no thought or idea of the difference, the total difference resulting from the step in which I have obeyed by faith.<a name=284:26></a> I do not think I could express too strongly the transition.<a name=284:27></a> I have no doubt at all that there is a delusion of the enemy over their minds.<a name=284:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In many other ways, and in the working in individual souls, the hand of God has been most marked.<a name=284:29></a> Your fast meeting would, I apprehend, identify me more or less with that which I have left, as acknowledging it more or less.<a name=284:30></a> This in the very smallest degree I would not do <i>for all the world</i>, and I am conscious that I am led of God in this.<a name=284:31></a> You cannot be surprised therefore that I am decided.<a name=284:32></a>

		Miss Hayes, I should not admit the cross to be the principle of union, because I cannot admit the work of Christ to be the bond exclusive of <i>His Person</i>.<a name=286:1></a> The cross may gather all, both Jew and Gentile, but they are gathered to Christ, not to the cross; and the difference is a most important and essential one, because it is of all-importance that the Person of the Son of God have His place.<a name=286:2></a> Christ Himself, not the cross of Christ, is the centre of union.<a name=286:3></a> The two or three are gathered to <i>His</i> name, not the cross.<a name=286:4></a> The scripture is uniform in its testimony as to this.<a name=286:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But further, where saints are gathered in unity, without any questionings, they have the truth and holiness to guard.<a name=286:6></a> It never was, and I trust never will be, the notion of brethren, that the truth of Christ's Person or godliness of walk was to be sacrificed to outward unity.<a name=286:7></a> It is making brethren of more importance than Christ; and even so, love to the brethren is false, for if true it is, John assures us, "love in the truth and for the truth's sake.<a name=286:8></a>" Supposing a person denied the divinity of Christ, or the resurrection of His body, still declaring his belief in the cross -- supposing he declared his belief in the cross and resurrection, but declared it was only a testimony of God's love, and no substitution or expiatory value in it, as many clergymen of high reputation in the Establishment now do -- is all this to be immaterial?<a name=286:9></a> I shall be told that no true believer could do this.<a name=286:10></a> In the first place, a true believer may be seduced into error; and further, the test offered becomes thus the opinion formed that a man is a true believer, and not the plain fundamental truth of God and His holiness.<a name=286:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Indeed, the letter betrays its own inconsistency, for it says, "brethren gathered round the Person of the Lord Jesus Christ?<a name=286:12></a>" Quite true; but what person?<a name=286:13></a> Would it be equal if He were owned to be God, or if it were denied?<a name=286:14></a> Or if He were the Son of God, the object of His Father's delight at all times -- or if He were a man -- or if He were really risen from the dead?<a name=286:15></a> I can hardly doubt the writer would say no.<a name=286:16></a> I am supposing all this.<a name=286:17></a> I answer then, your letter is all a fallacy, a delusion, and denies itself and its principles in the same page.<a name=286:18></a> For that is what I insist on, that I must have a <i>true</i> Christ, and that I am bound to maintain the truth of Christ in my communion.<a name=286:19></a> I am aware that the letter states we can deal with conduct (with morality) but not with these questions.<a name=286:20></a> But this is just what appears to me so excessively evil.<a name=286:21></a> Decency of conduct is necessary for communion; but a man may blaspheme Christ -- that is no matter; it is a matter, not of conduct, but of conscience!<a name=286:22></a> It is hinted, that perhaps if it be a teacher, he may be dealt with.<a name=286:23></a> In truth, the apostle desires even a woman not to let such a person into her house.<a name=286:24></a> It is not therefore so difficult to deal with.<a name=286:25></a> Just think of a system which makes blasphemous views of the Person of Christ -- what may amount to a denial of Him -- to be a matter of private conscience, having nothing to do with communion!<a name=286:26></a> And here is the very root of the question.<a name=286:27></a> I raise one before all their reasoning.<a name=286:28></a> I affirm that that is not a communion of believers at all, which is not founded on the acknowledgment of a <i>true</i> Christ.<a name=286:29></a> Where the truth as to this is commonly held and taught, I may have no need for particular inquiry.<a name=286:30></a> But that is not the case here.<a name=286:31></a> If I find a person even in such a case, <i>denying</i> the truth as to Christ, communion is impossible, because we have not a common Christ to have communion in.<a name=286:32></a> But here all faithfulness is thrown overboard.<a name=286:33></a> No call to confess a true Christ is admitted: it is a new test or term of communion!<a name=286:34></a> Mr.<a name=286:35></a> N.<a name=286:36></a> himself, and others holding his doctrines, have been invited or admitted.<a name=286:37></a> It is said we are to meet as Christians.<a name=286:38></a> But a man is not a Christian who professes a false Christ.<a name=286:39></a> The letter would have me judge the state of a person's heart.<a name=286:40></a> I cannot, while his profession is false: I may hope he is only misled, but cannot accept his profession.<a name=286:41></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am quite aware that it will be said, But these individuals do not hold these views.<a name=286:42></a> If wholly and not wilfully ignorant it is another matter; but we have to do with another case where, the views being held, they are declared to be a matter of private conscience; that a false Christ is as good as a true one, if a person's <i>conduct</i> is good -- we can judge only of the last!<a name=286:43></a> Now this principle is worse than the false doctrine, because it knows the falseness and blasphemy of it, and then says it is no matter.<a name=286:44></a> I do not own -- meetings as meetings of believers, for fundamental error as to Christ is immaterial for communion -- a matter, the letter tells me, not of conduct but of conscience.<a name=286:45></a> "If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe in thine heart that God has raised him from the dead.<a name=286:46></a>" Be it so.<a name=286:47></a> Suppose a person held He was a mere man, and quoted the passage to prove that <i>God</i> raised Him, and made Him Lord and Christ, would he be received?<a name=286:48></a> If not, you do try whether a man has the faith of God's elect.<a name=286:49></a> If not a Socinian is admissible as a believer; or you make <i>your opinion</i> of his being a believer the test, entirely independent of the faith of Christ.<a name=286:50></a> I go further.<a name=286:51></a> It is said you can only require a person to say he receives all in scripture as true.<a name=286:52></a> The supposed Socinian would accept such a test at once.<a name=286:53></a> They do so.<a name=286:54></a> Why should you ask even that?<a name=286:55></a> A man may be a believer and a rationalist in theory (sad as such a thought is) and not accept all as the word of God, and say, I am a believer in the cross -- you have no right to make a difficulty.<a name=286:56></a> If after this you object to any doctrine or insist on any truth, you have not even scripture to lean on against his denial of it.<a name=286:57></a> Scripture says, "Whom I love in the truth and for the truth's sake;" the other says it is no matter.<a name=286:58></a> You think the person a "spiritual believer;" the truth of Christ is no matter, a false one is just as good.<a name=286:59></a>

		The reference to the Ethiopian (Acts 8: 37) is unhappy, because it is recognised to be no part of scripture, and probably was added when they applied some test.<a name=286:92></a> The assertion about Romans 16: 17 is a very poor evasion of the text.<a name=286:93></a> There is not the smallest <i>pretext</i> for saying that it refers to the unity of the body; which is not at all the subject of the epistle, being only briefly alluded to in chapter 12 in reference to practice.<a name=286:94></a> "Cause divisions" is referred to; but there is nothing to divide; if there be not a true Christ as the basis of the meeting, there is no true unity at all.<a name=286:95></a> The reference to the Galatian church is an unhappy one.<a name=286:96></a> That epistle was not written about discipline, nor could it be, but to bring back the whole body of the saints in <i>many churches</i> to sound doctrine.<a name=286:97></a> But it shews that false doctrine was more terrible in the apostle's mind than the worst false conduct: not a wish of kindness, not a salutation, not a gracious word -- he breaks in at once with rebuke and reproach, and closes with resentful coldness -- while in Corinthians, where the most horrible wickedness was committed and gloried in by all, he says all the good of them he can.<a name=286:98></a>

		DEAR -- , -- As I am going to the other side of England, and hear you are very bad, I come to pay you a visit with this little note, as I had the advantage of talking with you when I was at -- ; yet I have but few words to say to you, as what God has graciously set before us is very simple; and thankful we ought to be that it is so.<a name=292:1></a> And what is deepest is simplest, that is the perfect love of God.<a name=292:2></a> Our difficulty is to reconcile our state, sinners as we are, with His loving us.<a name=292:3></a> Now that is exactly what the gospel shews us.<a name=292:4></a> Through that unspeakable fact of the death of the Son of God, His love has been shewn to us in what He did <i>for our sins</i>.<a name=292:5></a> He commends His love to us, in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us -- His love brought quite near to us where we are.<a name=292:6></a> Hence it is that it is only when we know where we are that we understand this love; that is, when we have learnt by divine teaching that we are mere sinners in ourselves, that in us (that is, in our flesh) dwells no good thing, we find that Jesus in this love has come to us there, and, though the Holy One, has been made sin for us.<a name=292:7></a> Oh, what a thought that is!<a name=292:8></a> How it opens the heart to guileless confession of what it is, and <i>all</i> the sin that is in it, so that it gets rest and peace with God.<a name=292:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I trust you enjoy this rest of heart.<a name=292:10></a> The work of Christ is perfect: He knew all our sins and all we were when He gave Himself for us, and has put all away, made us, if our sins were as scarlet, as white as snow.<a name=292:11></a> Think of your being really as white as snow before God, and you are bound to believe that, because it is the sure and revealed value of Christ's blood.<a name=292:12></a> Death has put an end to all we were in God's sight.<a name=292:13></a> And now, trusting you have this peace, and assured that it belongs to you, let me speak of another thing, the love of Him who has done this work for us.<a name=292:14></a> Think of Him, of His love, of His becoming a man for us, of His going willingly to death for us, that we might escape: how He must have loved you to do it!<a name=292:15></a> Do you think He loved you so as to do it?<a name=292:16></a> What a wonderful thought that the Son of God should love a poor thing like you, and want (He who wants nothing) to have you with Himself for your happiness and as a part of His own, the fruit of the travail of His soul.<a name=292:17></a> See what a difference this makes of death; it is not dying as some think it; it is going to Him, to One we love, to One we <i>know</i>, to One who has loved and loves us; it is departing and being with Christ.<a name=292:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If your soul has peace, think much of Him and His love, and may He be very near you.<a name=292:19></a> He refreshes the spirit, raises above weakness and pain to think these are but outward things for a little moment, and what we are going to lose is only sickness and what is mental and perishable, to be with One who has loved us in spite of all, and takes us to be with Himself.<a name=292:20></a> Think much on Jesus -- I do not mean as if you could <i>think</i> much in your weak state, but looking to Him -- and lean on Him as a sick child lies in its mother's arms because it has no strength, not because it can do much.<a name=292:21></a> Peace be with you, dear -- , and much of His presence, the true source of joy and strength.<a name=292:22></a> If you go a little before us to that blessed One it will surely not be your loss .<a name=292:23></a>.<a name=292:24></a>.<a name=292:25></a> .<a name=292:26></a>

		J G Bellett, It is the greatest joy to me that the hearts of the saints have been turned to souls, not surely from the Word, but charity thinks of souls.<a name=294:1></a> I remember often in olden times saying to you, remember the people have souls.<a name=294:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the work, I heartily and with deepest thankfulness delight in it.<a name=294:3></a> No doubt human infirmity may accompany its effect and working amongst men.<a name=294:4></a> Does that make one turn away from the manifest hand of God?<a name=294:5></a> There may be in given cases accompaniments which make it impossible to join in particular meetings or acts, but where God is free, where the Spirit is, there I ought to be; and if I cannot join, as I could not when Christ is preached of contention, rejoice for all that, that He is preached and brought to souls.<a name=294:6></a> I see that it will be a judgment on the professing church, because it seeks the credit of God's work, and does not own the presence of the Holy Spirit, and I have no desire that the truths which have made us own that and our place in the last days should be in any way enfeebled; but if full and happy liberty were left anywhere to the Spirit of God, nothing that grieved Him maintained, this consideration would lead me rather to cultivate intercourse.<a name=294:7></a> I judge it would be a deplorable sign if brethren could not freely rejoice, where God evidently works, but I have no desire in having my heart large, and tender too as regards the Lord's work, to have my feet out of the narrow path.<a name=294:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a very great joy to me to know these dear young C.<a name=294:9></a>s are converted.<a name=294:10></a> Give my kind remembrance to their father and mother, and tell them how heartily I sympathise with them.<a name=294:11></a> I was greatly rejoiced too in -- .<a name=294:12></a> Surely I remember him, for in two or three weeks I had become greatly attached to him.<a name=294:13></a> I never saw, I think, a soul receive Christ and the gospel as he did, a soul open under its influence as his did.<a name=294:14></a> The Lord grant his wife may follow his path.<a name=294:15></a> I trust the C.<a name=294:16></a>s may be in testimony there also, and that they may remain humble, serious, simple and unexcited; but I say cultivate these droppings of divine grace, this spring-time of the soul.<a name=294:17></a> There is need of building by the Word, but the earliest fruit of an awakened soul will be feeling, not knowledge, and this will become feeble and unhealthy if not fed by the word.<a name=294:18></a> But this process went on at first, and has given the Epistles, but we see the weakness which may accompany it; they would have given their eyes, but did not hold fast justification by faith.<a name=294:19></a> All this needs the continual work of the ministry -- not to make a fuss about the first feelings, the flowers which precede the fruit, but to labour therein to feed the soul.<a name=294:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to conversions in singing, there is nothing at all unscriptural.<a name=294:21></a> If the truth is in the hymn, spoken of with divine affections, or souls' affections expressed respecting a truth already outwardly admitted, it is quite within the ways and operation of the Spirit of God to act on the soul in a quickening way by it, not without truth, but by truth so addressed to the soul.<a name=294:22></a> I do not say that the work will be there as deep, or the foundation as solidly laid at the moment for after exercises, as if it was the direct application of the word by the Holy Ghost to the conscience, but the heart receives Christ convincingly and lovingly, so as to love.<a name=294:23></a> I have ever said that the smallest atom of Christ suffices for the Holy Ghost to quicken by, if it be really Him.<a name=294:24></a> No doubt a profound conviction of sin by the word casts off a mass of imaginings of the flesh by a deeper inward work, which such a conversion leaves undiscovered; but if God works, He will do His own work, and bring it to a good issue.<a name=294:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The work in Ireland has confirmed me largely in the truth of all I have learnt connected with brethrenism, so called, but it would be deplorable if I could not rejoice in God's acting wherever His own blessed sovereign goodness is pleased to do it.<a name=294:26></a> I do so with my whole heart, and if one is not ready for <i>Him</i>, there may be first last and last first, without the truth being weakened: salvation was of the Jews; alas, it was in result more <i>for</i> others than for them; the fields were whiter for harvest elsewhere than there.<a name=294:27></a>

		Dear F Cavenagh, -- I suppose from your letter that your boys have never been baptised.<a name=296:1></a> If such be the case, it is clear to me that they ought to be.<a name=296:2></a> I baptised myself, a number recently converted at Stafford, very recently.<a name=296:3></a> I look in no way on baptism or any other ordinance as a matter of obedience.<a name=296:4></a> I leave behind me, as being simple ignorance to refer to it, all reference to John's baptism, which was before the death and resurrection of Christ, and as far as it went would have hindered His being put to death.<a name=296:5></a> I reject all notion of a testimony to what we have already received, because it is entirely contrary to scripture.<a name=296:6></a> As to obedience; not only is obedience to ordinances, in principle, legal and unchristian, but the language of the word is, "What doth hinder me?<a name=296:7></a>" "Who can forbid water?<a name=296:8></a>" -- language wholly incompatible with the idea of obedience.<a name=296:9></a> I reject the idea of its being witness of what we have, because I find in scripture, "Wash away thy sins" -- "Buried with him by baptism unto death" -- not because you are washed, or are dead -- "Wherein also ye are risen" -- not because you are already.<a name=296:10></a> I see a command to baptise, none to be baptised; nor were the apostles baptised, save Paul.<a name=296:11></a> But I see it evidently to be the way in which disciples were received to Christ publicly and outwardly.<a name=296:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a mistake to think that it has to do with the unity of the body: for this Christ had to ascend on high and send down the Holy Spirit, and "by one <i>Spirit</i> we are all baptised into one body" -- but of this unity the Lord's supper is the sign, not baptism.<a name=296:13></a> This goes no farther than death and resurrection; what is individual, that the flesh is hopelessly bad.<a name=296:14></a> Men are dead to it in Christ and alive in the power of resurrection only, of which profession is outwardly made in baptism -- not that we are so, but we enter in (outwardly) by this door, by dying and rising again, namely, in owning Christ dead and risen for us.<a name=296:15></a> There is no entering into the heavenly and eternal blessing but by the reality of this, nor properly into the outward establishment of it in the earth but by the sign of this.<a name=296:16></a> This is the confession made by baptism.<a name=296:17></a> This is, I am persuaded, the intelligence of it: as to your dear boys, this I am assured should be their mind, to do it intelligently.<a name=296:18></a> The recognition that if any man be in Christ, the body is <i>dead</i> because of sin, the Spirit life because of righteousness; that there is no mending, no remedy for the old man but death; but that in entering Christ we die and rise again in the power of a new life, in which alone we live to God.<a name=296:19></a>

		The Lord bless them abundantly, and keep them in the deep sense of the truth of this, and in much joyful confidence in the grace of God, the Saviour, and our Father, and in Him who has called them in His love.<a name=296:20></a> How thankful I am to think of them as different from what they were when I saw them, though, I doubted not kind, good boys.<a name=296:21></a>

		Dearest Dr.<a name=297:1></a> Cronin, -- The London Bridge meeting has been for some time on my mind, and I judge that something must be done.<a name=297:2></a> Several causes contribute to its want of influence, and even jealousy as to it, which exists in certain gatherings.<a name=297:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Formerly there were many brethren, as -- , -- , and others, who exercised a pastoral care, which had a great influence on individual blessing and calmness.<a name=297:4></a> Souls were thought of more, decisions of assemblies less, though arrived at when needed.<a name=297:5></a> The number of brethren and meetings was less, and the great body of brethren more in one meeting in Rawstorne Street, the rest being succursal, so to speak.<a name=297:6></a> Now there are many almost equally important meetings.<a name=297:7></a> Hence the difficulty of maintaining the common action is a real one; but if there is a hearty loving desire to do it, it can be effected, surely, with God's gracious help.<a name=297:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These affairs of Mr.<a name=297:9></a> -- have increased the prejudice against London Bridge.<a name=297:10></a> I regret altogether still the course of -- and your own.<a name=297:11></a> The more I reflect, the more I feel that it did not rise above the circumstances to act with God in them, but was under their influence.<a name=297:12></a> The last act of -- finished the matter, and though the brethren at London Bridge did not go with you two, the public effect was the same.<a name=297:13></a> -- , seeing this, did his best to destroy its influence, and to awaken jealousy.<a name=297:14></a> But I am satisfied that at present in those most uneasy as to the action of London Bridge there is no desire for independent churches, but quite the contrary; nor do I see any great difficulty save in the case of discipline.<a name=297:15></a> I should take the ground, not of contesting the duty of the local gathering to investigate and form its judgment -- it must be practically so done, you do so I am persuaded at -- , -- but that if they hold there is one body in London, they ought not to impose their judgment without giving an opportunity to others to know what decision they had come to, and make their representations if they had any to make, which might often arise.<a name=297:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What seems to me ought to be done would be to invite the chief men among the brethren from every gathering, writing to one only, to propose their coming together to confer upon it, not forming a decision to be announced, but what could be proposed to all the gatherings when it had been laid before the assembled brothers.<a name=297:17></a> Thus, suppose I wrote to -- or -- at Deptford, to propose that the brethren there who were interested in the general course of the gathering should come, say to -- at the Priory, and the same to the rest; and then they consulted and arranged that the brethren really interested in the gatherings should meet in any given place on a Saturday evening, the place being agreed on by all, and that the responsibility of these brethren should be felt.<a name=297:18></a> It would then have to be considered how in cases of discipline (in receptions it would go on, I suppose, as usual) matters should be arranged.<a name=297:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My impression is that the local gatherings must come to a decision; nothing would hinder consultation on Saturday evening, but they owe it to the others to certify it before it is finally <i>executed</i>.<a name=297:20></a> They can come to the decision, and then communicate it through the Saturday evening meeting to all the others, and like a person proposed, it would be final if nothing were said.<a name=297:21></a> If any who heard it had any difficulty, they could communicate with the brethren of the gathering who had come to the decision.<a name=297:22></a> But this would be considered when together.<a name=297:23></a> You must remember there is not a body formed and grown up in one gathering, nor any practical body of elders acting together among the saints as a whole: one must look therefore to God to draw out of what materials exist, what He can form to help the saints.<a name=297:24></a> And if they help one another all will be well.<a name=297:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The brethren, on consultation, will see what is to be done in ordinary cases of discipline, but they should remember that in sending the names of others as put out, they impose on other brethren the task of registering their act without any power even of objecting.<a name=297:26></a> If there be no intercommunication, then we have independent churches, or at least are on the way to them.<a name=297:27></a> You may regret the young men, but you must look at the main point, the union of brethren who care for the saints, in common care.<a name=297:28></a> In our former Friday morning meetings they were not there, and if one may regret their absence, the union of service in the gatherings is first to be considered.<a name=297:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Do not feel uneasy at young brethren growing up into service.<a name=297:30></a> We were all young once.<a name=297:31></a> I am delighted when I see them getting into serious service, but I do look for pastoral care.<a name=297:32></a> The regular work of evangelisation is more to me than excited meetings, but if the Lord converts He converts, and we must rejoice.<a name=297:33></a> The excitement of the moment will pass away, what is solid will remain.<a name=297:34></a> One has to go through it, like all else, with God.<a name=297:35></a> The power of God is shewn in all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness.<a name=297:36></a> I am at a conference of labouring brethren here for a few days.<a name=297:37></a> There is blessing in the neighbourhood, and a large number of saints, but devotedness and labourers everywhere are wanting.<a name=297:38></a> But there has been a great deal of blessing .<a name=297:39></a>.<a name=297:40></a>.<a name=297:41></a> .<a name=297:42></a> I must close .<a name=297:43></a>.<a name=297:44></a>.<a name=297:45></a> .<a name=297:46></a>

		... I believe we ought to preach the love of God to sinners, and appeal to them more than we do, though I do so much more when addressing a mixed crowd of probably careless people than in the assemblies where you would hear me.<a name=301:1></a> In these you must remember that the great body are believers, and want rather to be better founded than called.<a name=301:2></a> All I look for is that the preaching should be such that it should convict of sin, and the impossibility of sin and God going together, so that it should be well understood that there is need of <i>reconciling</i>.<a name=301:3></a> And here Christ at once comes in, and atonement and righteousness.<a name=301:4></a> Holiness precludes all sin from God, righteousness judges it.<a name=301:5></a> This I believe the sinner should understand, so that he should know <i>what love applies to</i>, yet that love should be fully preached.<a name=301:6></a> It does itself often convict of sin, for the conscience has often its wants already, and this draws them out, so that men find consciously where they are.<a name=301:7></a> But conviction of sin under righteousness is a very useful thing if grace be fully preached with it, and both unite in Christ.<a name=301:8></a>

		[G Gausby] DEAREST BROTHER, -- I am sure it is of the utmost importance that you or any of us should systematically study the word.<a name=302:1></a> You could not do better than give regularly, and, assuming the first of all things direct communion with God, the first fruits of your time to the regular study of the word.<a name=302:2></a> A taking the Spirit without the word is a false pretension to power, out of the place of obedience and heart subjection.<a name=302:3></a> As regards the guidance of the Spirit and method, only in the highest form I find both in the apostle.<a name=302:4></a> If we are "beside ourselves it is to God," if we are "sober it is for your cause.<a name=302:5></a>" There is a power which takes us, as it were, out of ourselves, where God is in divine energy, but there is a calculation of love which is divine too.<a name=302:6></a> He was in God's presence in power through the Holy Ghost, but the love of God working in him made him think of others -- two blessed ways of being delivered from self.<a name=302:7></a> Sober for your sakes is the method, the calculation of love for others.<a name=302:8></a>

		As to reading itself, the scripture is plain; "Meditate on these things, give thyself wholly to them, that thy profiting may appear to all.<a name=302:9></a>" I find two ways of reading scripture: putting through grace my heart and conscience before it, so that it should act on me as subject to it; and studying it to seize it with its bearing, connection, and depth.<a name=302:10></a> It should be a first thing to be filled; then draw from the stores of communion, and then when real the free action of the Holy Ghost.<a name=302:11></a> The scripture distinctly speaks of order and method, as it does of the free action of the Holy Ghost.<a name=302:12></a> 1 Timothy is, nearly all of it, methodical direction; only now, when outward order is become the power of evil, and Christians are individualised in it, power is become the main thing -- God being thus manifested -- and all saints not being gathered, the general order cannot be there.<a name=302:13></a> And this is the trial of brethren's faith.<a name=302:14></a> But this does not hinder the general principle of order, still less individual order and method.<a name=302:15></a> I never thought of such a thing.<a name=302:16></a> Unless special claims come, I always work till dinner-time in the house from the time I am up, then visit, etc.<a name=302:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Next as to the Sunday school: it is not for me a question of neglecting the Lord's Supper and remaining to keep the children, but of devotedness to the service of Christ, for which one deprives oneself of a wonted enjoyment, and thus in no way of the delight in and desire of it.<a name=302:18></a> It is not as if a servant is obliged to stay, but as if a mother stayed with a sick child -- she would feel the deprivation, but do her duty; as if an opportunity offered to preach to sinners and a person went once and left the breaking of bread.<a name=302:19></a> It would be a question of his being called of God and devoted to it.<a name=302:20></a> The question then is of one devoted to the children as a work for the Lord, and then giving up a Sunday in three for the work of the Lord, and as devotedness to Him.<a name=302:21></a> This must be a question of the individual's feeling that he is called to it as devotedness to the Lord.<a name=302:22></a> There is an accessory question; that is, whether the taking care of the children is necessary to the prosperity of the school and their good.<a name=302:23></a> If so, I should feel no scruple or difficulty in remaining so to keep them.<a name=302:24></a> Habitual giving up the Lord's supper for the school I should object to.<a name=302:25></a>

		As to the meeting: they have already had such in -- , I suppose.<a name=302:26></a> It may be simple, I should suppose, to write to a known labourer in a given place, and say that it was the desire of those <i>actually labouring</i> in the word to study somewhat together, and invite such.<a name=302:27></a> I should rather think, unless there were a very great desire in labouring brethren to come together, the easier way for you would be to invite those around in actual England, or nearly accessible places, and have the meeting in a private house.<a name=302:28></a> It should have thus more a confidential character, not of the meeting in a public assembly.<a name=302:29></a> If the desire is great among the brethren who are actually labouring, it may give occasion to a wider circle of country.<a name=302:30></a> Nothing would hinder your asking any individual brethren who are accustomed to go everywhere if so inclined.<a name=302:31></a>

		It is important to know grace and free power; it is also important to see the government of God, and so moral subjection and order.<a name=302:38></a> I should also be exceedingly sorry to see that the peculiar principles of brethren, and their just and never to be loosened attachment to the assembling of the saints, led to the giving up of work among souls.<a name=302:39></a> It was quite the contrary at the first.<a name=302:40></a> And if love is at work -- if the <i>meetings</i> are to be blest it must be so -- what works in the world blesses the meeting; only we must have the thought of the Holy Ghost really being in both .<a name=302:41></a>.<a name=302:42></a>.<a name=302:43></a> .<a name=302:44></a>

		As regards the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, it is to be remarked, that though the word be not used, the fact had practically place for Jews, Samaritans, and Gentiles.<a name=304:3></a> (Acts 2; 8: 16-17; and 10: 44-45.<a name=304:4></a>) You will find the words "fallen upon" and "poured out" so used as to arrive in sum in one common fact.<a name=304:5></a> Still, I think this is a confirmation of the thought, that the gift or the pouring out of the Holy Ghost is an original and primary gift to the saints, though each receives the Holy Ghost when he has believed, as regards his own particular portion in it.<a name=304:6></a> (Acts 19: 2.<a name=304:7></a>) The three preceding passages shew that on each distinct part out of which the church had to be formed God put the seal of His Spirit, giving it a divine and independent title to relationship with Himself and to the common unity.<a name=304:8></a> But this once formed, and the Holy Ghost dwelling in the one assembly, there was no such formative and sealing power to be looked for, because the Holy Ghost was there, and to abide there for ever.<a name=304:9></a> It is an effort at re-commencement of what has already a responsible position before God in virtue of having the Holy Ghost; and to look for its coming on the church is to deny that it is there, and that we are responsible in this way.<a name=304:10></a> God may pardon and reply to ignorant expressions, but deliberately used it is incredulity.<a name=304:11></a> The last passage shews that individuals partaking of it is a distinct and very important point.<a name=304:12></a> To doubt whether Samaritans or Gentiles could receive it, so as to have share in the new privileges, was, if an unfounded doubt, one well worthy of God to resolve in grace, yet in the way of a common unity -- I do not mean exactly of the body here, but of the assemblage on earth.<a name=304:13></a> The desire that the Spirit of God may act mightily is good; that He may be poured out -- may be pardoned and blessing given, but -- is unbelief.<a name=304:14></a> I can have no doubt that the work in Ireland will be to the judgment of the professing church.<a name=304:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards 2 Corinthians 5: 10, the use of "we" depends on the context.<a name=304:16></a> It is used for Jews, Christians, men by the apostle, and in even vaguer senses.<a name=304:17></a> In this passage the following verse demonstrates, it seems to me, that it is men: "knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade <i>men</i>.<a name=304:18></a>" Why, if they were not objects of the judgment in question, which formed the ground of the terror?<a name=304:19></a> He did not persuade men that they might come under judgment as Christians, but to be Christians because they were subject to it as men.<a name=304:20></a> It seems to me very simple.<a name=304:21></a>

		[<i>To the same</i>.<a name=306:1></a>] Dearest W Kelly, -- It seems to me that the argument as to Revelation has no force at all, and must come from a person who has not taken the trouble to inquire much into the views of which he judges .<a name=306:2></a>.<a name=306:3></a>.<a name=306:4></a> .<a name=306:5></a>

		The city in chapter 21 I believe to be the church, because it comes down from heaven from God, and yet more because the prophet is invited to see the bride the Lamb's wife, the heavenly city in contrast to Babylon.<a name=306:6></a> Whereas the city in chapter 11 is a city on earth trodden under foot by the nations for forty and two months, where there is testimony before the God of the earth, and it is in connection with Christ's taking possession of earth and sea by power.<a name=306:7></a> The question to what the term city applies is in no way guided by the new Jerusalem, for that comes down from God out of heaven, and from this fact is evidently, as from its whole description, a figure, and more than a figure, a symbolic city.<a name=306:8></a> This is on earth before the other is revealed.<a name=306:9></a> The question to what city does chapter 11 refer must be judged by the conclusion to which we come as to the bearing of all this part of the book, and of chapters 10, 11 in particular.<a name=306:10></a> I believe a certain prolonged application can be given in the sense in which John said there were many antichrists, but they were not the Antichrist.<a name=306:11></a> In this moral sense, then, passages may have an application to the present order of things; but I do not doubt that the things which come after "the things which are" do not belong to the present order of things, but to the time when God is bringing in His only begotten into the world, when He is busied with the government of the world, and hence with the Jews who are the central object of that government.<a name=306:12></a> Hence it is said that the witnesses stand before the God of the <i>earth</i>.<a name=306:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The same argument applies in all its force to chapter 7, but more than that.<a name=306:14></a> It contrasts in the distinctest way the tribes of Israel, and those of the nations and tongues; to make this the same class is absurd, upon the face of it; to make the tribes the elect and the other not is equally so, for those of the nations are gathered out for blessing; a little serious simplicity soon decides this question.<a name=306:15></a> As regards the 144,000, which is a question of detail, I can understand that it leaves more room for doubt; but in chapter 7 I see all the servants of God of all the tribes sealed before the judgment.<a name=306:16></a> In chapter 14 I see a special class most particularly associated with the Lamb, having His Father's name (not their Father's) on their forehead; that is, I see, having passed through suffering from their nation, analogous to Christ, and marked according to this special place, and His cortge in the kingdom; I believe them therefore a class apart and marked out before the harvest, "first fruits" of the new system.<a name=306:17></a> Chapter 7 has no way this character.<a name=306:18></a> The number makes no difference; it is a mystic one, 12 by 12 by 1000.<a name=306:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards the application of Luke 15 to a Christian turned aside, I have often heard it, but I reject it altogether.<a name=306:20></a> The fact of God's graciously receiving back a wandered Christian is of course true, but such is not the purpose of the parable.<a name=306:21></a> The first verses shew, as distinctly as possible, that that is not its purport.<a name=306:22></a> The question is between the Pharisees and Jesus eating with and receiving sinners.<a name=306:23></a> He thereon gives the picture of God's love in seeking and in receiving sinners.<a name=306:24></a> The two first describe the seeking (as I believe by Christ and the Spirit), the third the reception.<a name=306:25></a> The reception back of a Christian fallen had not its application here.<a name=306:26></a> Further, the introduction of the eldest son carries us back evidently to the Jew, or any legally self-righteous person, but literally to the Jew in "all that I have is thine.<a name=306:27></a>" The principle is shewn in the two first, joy in heaven over a sinner that repents, and the third the way of original departure and return.<a name=306:28></a> Hence all that is seen of the elder is not an original estate, but the Jews' jealousy of the admission of sinners of the Gentiles.<a name=306:29></a> The notion that "son" carries with it the reality of being born of God is all a delusion; because then the eldest ought to be one; whereas on the footing of grace (which makes sons) he would not come in.<a name=306:30></a> Adam was the Son of God; "Israel my firstborn.<a name=306:31></a>" The remark you refer to is all a mistake, because the first parables shew the seeking, the active love of God; this, the reception by the Father of one who returned.<a name=306:32></a> I have myself no kind of doubt of the true application .<a name=306:33></a>.<a name=306:34></a>.<a name=306:35></a> .<a name=306:36></a>

		It is remarkable that in the New Testament no one speaks of righteousness by faith, except Paul.<a name=309:23></a> I have found many souls who understand forgiveness, but who know nothing of the righteousness of God, and for whom the presentation of the day of judgment is often good as a touchstone, in order to see if they are really on the footing of divine righteousness in their relations with our good and faithful God.<a name=309:24></a>

		[G Biava] [<i>From the French</i>.<a name=310:1></a>] BELOVED BROTHER, -- I have just received your letter, and thank God from my heart that He has strengthened you, body and soul.<a name=310:2></a> He is ever faithful, ever good.<a name=310:3></a> We can always reckon upon Him, whatever the case may be.<a name=310:4></a> His love changes not, and He is always thinking of us -- wonderful it is, but true -- and He numbers the hairs of our heads.<a name=310:5></a> Surely it is wonderful that the God of glory enters into all the details of our lives, and ever with our blessing in view -- "He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous" -- but He does enter into them, and "all things work together for good" to those who love Him.<a name=310:6></a> Remember me very kindly to Mrs.<a name=310:7></a> -- : may God bless your little one too.<a name=310:8></a> It is a care, surely, in such a world as this, but a care which God, if we trust in Him, can take, does in fact take as an occasion for fresh proofs of His faithfulness and His goodness.<a name=310:9></a> May God grant that you may both be faithful and may know how to bring him up for Him.<a name=310:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With regard to the -- matter, I look at it in a rather different light from the way in which it was told me, at least.<a name=310:11></a> Our dear brother F.<a name=310:12></a> told me a little of what had passed.<a name=310:13></a> I do not look upon the position of those sisters as excommunication.<a name=310:14></a> The assembly alone could excommunicate them; but when they said, to J.<a name=310:15></a> and others, that they did not wish to come, he was free to say, as his own opinion -- and that of others, if they authorised him to say it -- that that was their opinion.<a name=310:16></a> I do not say that it was a wise thing, or according to God, but that they were free to express their opinion as their opinion.<a name=310:17></a> If the flesh produced that opinion, it is clear that it was not according to God.<a name=310:18></a> But I do not think that a brother or sister has a right to withdraw, and return at their own pleasure.<a name=310:19></a> The assembly must have its word to say about it.<a name=310:20></a> It might be that the person who had withdrawn had committed all manner of sins during his absence.<a name=310:21></a> Therefore, if any one stands aside, the assembly must say whether it can receive the individual when he may wish to return.<a name=310:22></a> I hope, and I will say I have good hope, that this will be so, that the assembly will be blessed and re-established by grace.<a name=310:23></a> If it goes on in humility, and in a spirit of dependence on grace, it will be so.<a name=310:24></a> If grace works in the hearts of these sisters, they will judge what has been of the flesh in themselves.<a name=310:25></a> Perhaps -- , having been accustomed to rule, may have shewn, on his part, a want of spiritual <i>savoir faire</i>.<a name=310:26></a> I am sure that your own part is to labour according to grace, and to communicate to souls what God has given you for them, at the same time feeding your own soul.<a name=310:27></a> Besides, that is what is far the best thing for the assembly itself.<a name=310:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I doubt its being God's will to deprive a soul of the Lord's Supper because it is in a bad state.<a name=310:29></a> The word says, "Let a man examine himself, and so let him eat.<a name=310:30></a>" But if I saw a soul in a state as to conscience which sin had produced, and if he did not know where he was, I can, it seems to me, suppose a case in which I might advise a person to keep away until he was clear; but as a general rule, one cannot exclude people provisionally; it is only in peculiar cases that I could give this advice.<a name=310:31></a> Pastoral care is the remedy for a soul in a bad state, not temporary exclusion.<a name=310:32></a> This care is sometimes rather wanting amongst brethren, and instead of this expedients are used.<a name=310:33></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think the "strangers" (3 John 5) were people who did not belong to the place, principally brothers (perhaps others), towards whom they exercised hospitality, and especially labourers for the Lord.<a name=310:34></a> Diotrephes would not have it.<a name=310:35></a> You can see that the second epistle warned the elect lady <i>not</i> to receive those who did not bring sound doctrine concerning the Person of Christ; the third encourages Gaius in his hospitality.<a name=310:36></a> I think that these were in general Christians -- at the same time approving his hospitality as a whole (compare Hebrews 12: 2) -- on account of what follows.<a name=310:37></a> Diotrephes would not have it, wishing to have the assembly to himself, and to break the link with the apostle and all the brethren.<a name=310:38></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the word "Gentiles," Diodati writes the words "have gone out from amongst the Gentiles.<a name=310:39></a>" But this is not received by many, still there are very respectable names which accept it.<a name=310:40></a> I think John, like Peter, was still much attached to the Jewish cradle of Christianity; thus in 1 John 2: 2, "our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the whole world.<a name=310:41></a>" Paul himself does this very often, as in Galatians 3, where he uses "we" (Jews) "you" (Gentiles) "we" (Christians).<a name=310:42></a> I think it is rather a question of believing Gentiles than of unbelieving, but it may well be that they did not wish to take anything from their relations.<a name=310:43></a> The apostles considered the Jews (even the unbelieving ones) as brethren, not in the Christian sense, but in the national.<a name=310:44></a> Paul does this in his preaching.<a name=310:45></a> The Gentiles were only Gentiles, and it may be that Diotrephes would not receive labourers from among the Gentiles; and that these labourers were to be received (it was their title -- amongst Christians, Jews by race) just because they would not receive anything from the Gentiles, their relations, unbelievers or otherwise .<a name=310:46></a>.<a name=310:47></a>.<a name=310:48></a> .<a name=310:49></a> Good-bye, dear brother.<a name=310:50></a> May our good and faithful Father, full of love, be with you, encourage you, and keep you near to Himself; and in the enjoyment of the love of Jesus one is always happy, always encouraged.<a name=310:51></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With regard to Italy; this is my position in this respect.<a name=312:19></a> When the work began at Florence, and certain persons were mixed up with it, and then some Italians, in consequence of the malicious talk of the Genevans, were frightened at the name of Plymouth Brethren, I felt that I could not act with them, and to raise questions for those inexperienced souls would have been cruelty.<a name=312:20></a> I could only commit the matter to God; but with patience the time for acting and witnessing for God comes, if we wait on Him.<a name=312:21></a> One grows weary of evil, and of what is of man, when there is the desire for Christ.<a name=312:22></a> I believe, though this may be a small thing, that time is dawning in Italy, but it is still -- not to say always -- needful to wait on God.<a name=312:23></a> One cannot but respond to the wants of faith.<a name=312:24></a> It is not like a first preaching of the gospel; but I believe wants are beginning to make themselves known; and I am sure that our good and faithful Master, and the God of grace will meet those wants; I have confidence as to this.<a name=312:25></a> Our brother -- is going there for his health.<a name=312:26></a> I hope he may be of use, though he goes there to recruit -- God knows.<a name=312:27></a> However this may be, I believe God Himself will work.<a name=312:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe the neutral party is declining; in one or two places, worldly Christians take the place of something of this kind, and it flourishes, but along with much worldliness; still, in general we see that it breaks down, that they have not the power of God.<a name=312:29></a> Moreover, where it flourishes outwardly, souls in need of Christ leave them, and come amongst brethren.<a name=312:30></a> They try to sustain themselves by the activity of the revival, but it has no foundation.<a name=312:31></a> Conversions are numerous on all sides, and there is excitement, and even some of our brethren who are active in it are deceived in their hopes by counting up the conversions too hastily.<a name=312:32></a> This does harm in a measure, but all the same there is <i>much</i> of God in it.<a name=312:33></a> The work is somewhat superficial, but true conversions are <i>very numerous</i>.<a name=312:34></a> This needs care, for the meetings are increasing enormously, and these inexperienced souls must be established.<a name=312:35></a> This is my special work just now, and though I sometimes sigh a little to be preaching the gospel (with this, however, I am engaged at the same time) I am very happy in the work.<a name=312:36></a> Besides, in general the brethren are going on well, and there is life, and a brighter waiting for the Lord.<a name=312:37></a> If it were a question only of increase of numbers, we should be in a most flourishing condition, but I believe, through the goodness of God, there is much more than that.<a name=312:38></a> This engrosses the brethren.<a name=312:39></a> There is weakness, no doubt, but they experience the goodness of God.<a name=312:40></a> In Ireland there is much blessing.<a name=312:41></a>

		Be of good cheer, dear brother; we must work for a little while, and with a strength which is not our own, but which is enough for everything; and we work under the eye, and encouraged by the goodness of Him whose love never fails us.<a name=312:42></a> Count upon Him, abide in Him, feed on Him; then work patiently on, according to the strength He gives you, "strengthened with all might according to his glorious power.<a name=312:43></a>" Remember me to -- and to all the assembly warmly.<a name=312:44></a> May God grant them to feed on the Lord continually, and to covet piety and communion with Him.<a name=312:45></a> I am away from home, and I see that I have not your last letter with me; if I find there is anything important in it, I will write from London.<a name=312:46></a>

		[<i>From the French</i>.<a name=314:1></a>] VERY DEAR BROTHER, -- Through the multitude of my occupations, I had rather overlooked an important subject in your letter.<a name=314:2></a> This fresh breaking out of the doctrine of freewill ministers to the pretension of the natural man not to be entirely lost, for that is just what it amounts to.<a name=314:3></a> All who have never been deeply convicted of sin, all those with whom this conviction is based on gross and outward sins, believe more or less in free-will.<a name=314:4></a> You know that it is the dogma of the Wesleyans, of all reasoners, of all philosophers; but it completely changes the whole idea of Christianity, and entirely perverts it.<a name=314:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If Christ came to save that which is lost, free-will has no more place.<a name=314:6></a> Not that God prevents man from receiving Christ -- far from it.<a name=314:7></a> But even when God employs all possible motives, everything that is capable of exerting influence over the heart of man, it only serves to prove that man will have none of it, that his heart is so corrupt, and his will so determined not to submit to God (however much it may be of the devil who encourages him in sin), that nothing can induce him to receive the Lord, and to forsake sin.<a name=314:8></a> If, by liberty of man, they mean that no one forces him to reject the Lord, this liberty exists in full.<a name=314:9></a> But if it is implied that, on account of the dominion of sin of which he is the slave, and that voluntarily, he cannot escape from his condition, and choose the good -- even while acknowledging it to be good, and approving of it -- then he has no liberty whatever.<a name=314:10></a> He is not subject to the law, neither indeed can be; so that, they that are in the flesh cannot please God.<a name=314:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And this is where we touch most closely upon the root of the question.<a name=314:12></a> Is it the old man that is changed, instructed and sanctified; or do we, in order to be saved, receive a new nature?<a name=314:13></a> The universal character of the unbelief of the present day is this: not formally denying Christianity, as in former times, or rejecting Christ openly, but receiving Him as a Person -- they will even say divine, inspired (but as a matter of degree) -- who re-establishes man in his position as a child of God.<a name=314:14></a> The Wesleyans, as far as taught of God, do not say that; faith makes them feel that without Christ they are lost, and that it is a question of salvation.<a name=314:15></a> Only their fear with regard to pure grace, their desire to gain men, a mixture of charity and of the spirit of man; in a word, their confidence in their own strength, makes confusion in their teaching, and leads them not to recognise the total ruin of man.<a name=314:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As for me, I see in the word, and I recognise in myself, the total ruin of man.<a name=314:17></a> I see that the cross is the end of all the means that God has employed to gain the heart of man, and, consequently, that it proves the thing to be impossible.<a name=314:18></a> God has exhausted all His resources; man has shewn that he was wicked, past recovery; the cross of Christ condemns man -- sin in the flesh.<a name=314:19></a> But this condemnation having been expressed in that another has undergone it, it is the absolute salvation of those who believe, for condemnation, the judgment of sin is behind us; life came out of it in resurrection.<a name=314:20></a> We are dead to sin, and alive to God, in Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=314:21></a> Redemption, the very word, loses its force when we entertain these ideas of the old man.<a name=314:22></a> It becomes an amelioration, a practical deliverance from a moral state, and not a redeeming by the finished work of another.<a name=314:23></a> Christianity teaches the death of the old man, and his just condemnation, then redemption accomplished by Christ, and a new life, eternal life, <i>come down from heaven</i> in His Person, and which is communicated to us when Christ enters into us by the word.<a name=314:24></a> Arminianism, or rather Pelagianism, pretends that man can choose, and that thus the old man is ameliorated by the thing it has accepted.<a name=314:25></a> The first step is made without grace, and it is the first step which truly costs in this case.<a name=314:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe that we ought to keep to the word; but, philosophically and morally speaking, free-will is a false and absurd theory.<a name=314:27></a> Free-will is a state of sin.<a name=314:28></a> Man ought not to have to choose, as being outside of good.<a name=314:29></a> Why is he in that state?<a name=314:30></a> He ought not to have a will, any choice to make -- he ought to obey, and enjoy in peace.<a name=314:31></a> If he has to choose good, then he has not got it yet.<a name=314:32></a> He is without that which is good in himself, at any rate, since he is not decided.<a name=314:33></a> But, in fact, man is disposed to follow that which is evil.<a name=314:34></a> What cruelty to propose a duty to man who is already turned to evil!<a name=314:35></a> Moreover, philosophically speaking, to choose, he must be indifferent, otherwise he has already chosen as to his will -- he must then be absolutely indifferent.<a name=314:36></a> Now, if he is absolutely indifferent, what is to decide his choice?<a name=314:37></a> A creature must have a motive; but he has none, since he is indifferent; if he is not, he has chosen.<a name=314:38></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, in fact, it is not so; man has a conscience, but he has a will and lusts, and they lead him.<a name=314:39></a> Man was free in paradise, but then he was in the enjoyment of good.<a name=314:40></a> He made use of his free-will, and consequently he is a sinner.<a name=314:41></a> To leave him to his free-will, now that he is disposed to do evil, would be cruelty.<a name=314:42></a> God has presented to him the choice, but it was to convince the conscience of the fact that, in any case, man would have neither good nor God.<a name=314:43></a> I have been somewhat oppressed with sleep while writing to you, but I think you will understand me.<a name=314:44></a> That people should believe that God loves the world is all right; but that they should not believe that man is in himself wicked beyond remedy (and notwithstanding the remedy) is very bad.<a name=314:45></a> They know not themselves, and they know not God.<a name=314:46></a> The Lord is coming, dear brother; the time for the world is passing away.<a name=314:47></a> What a blessing!<a name=314:48></a> May God find us watching, and thinking only of one thing -- of Him about whom God thinks -- Jesus, our precious Saviour.<a name=314:49></a>

		I believe that this truth has more practical power in the hearts of our brethren in England; God be praised for it.<a name=317:44></a> Conversions are still frequent, the meetings increase, and fresh ones are formed; there is a little more devotedness, and, I think, a good spirit and unity.<a name=317:45></a> There are some meetings which are ten times more numerous than they were last year, and others twice as numerous; and though there is more activity, and there was a time of peril for some who were in danger of being drawn into the current of the Revival, I believe the principles of brethren are dearer than ever to them.<a name=317:46></a> There is much which is superficial in this revival; more here than in Ireland, but many true conversions besides.<a name=317:47></a>

		[<i>From the French</i>.<a name=319:1></a>] -- - The conviction that the same spirit which is at work here is working in France to popularise German unbelief, and that, consequently, it is an organised work of the enemy, has induced me to reply to the English publication which serves as the flag of the infidel party.<a name=319:2></a> I am engaged with it at present.<a name=319:3></a> The result of my examination has been, not only that the Bible has gained yet greater value in my eyes, but that I am fully convinced of the superficial spirit and falseness of the upholders of infidelity.<a name=319:4></a> Their knowledge is nothing but a bringing together of all the objections which are built upon suppositions and reasonings, without foundation.<a name=319:5></a> There is a want of conscientious investigation, which strikes one when one makes such oneself.<a name=319:6></a> There is nothing historical in their history.<a name=319:7></a> It is an unlimited confidence in the power of the human mind in <i>these days</i> (for until now people have always been mistaken), which is truly ridiculous.<a name=319:8></a> They think they are able to say that such and such a thing must be so, that such a period must be of such duration, etc.<a name=319:9></a>: that must be, or cannot be -- never that <i>is</i>.<a name=319:10></a> The whole system of Bunsen, their Corypheus, is but a reproduction of Philo, the platonist Jew, with the name of Christ which they have attached to it, more or less, for appearance' sake.<a name=319:11></a> They count the long lists of Manetho, the dynasties, and the great number of kings who have governed Egypt, and give them as an evident proof that the world has lasted, or must have lasted, twenty thousand years at least.<a name=319:12></a> When the monuments are examined, we find two, four, eight of these kings on one single monument, reigning together, one often subordinate to another.<a name=319:13></a> Then, the fact of being free from the grooves of old theology, without having faith, makes unbelievers of them.<a name=319:14></a> They knew only that routine; the ice is broken, and, having had nothing but that, nothing at all is left.<a name=319:15></a> Truth does not exist.<a name=319:16></a> They have seen that the old forms are not tenable, and nothing remains to them.<a name=319:17></a> I admit that one has to come out of the old forms, but we ought to bless God that, in place of forms, His grace has given us <i>the truth</i>; we have much to learn, without doubt -- more to realise, but a divine certainty with regard to what we possess.<a name=319:18></a> What a sweet and peaceful thought!<a name=319:19></a>

		The case of the wicked rich man was certainly not the judgment of the kingdom, for it was immediately after his death.<a name=320:18></a> If Matthew 22: 13 spoke only of a temporary judgment, no hypocrite would be subjected to any other; if this judgment is not temporary, then the whole system falls.<a name=320:19></a> But see the effect when parables which state general principles are used for the details which will accompany them: 1.<a name=320:20></a> There will be only one man judged.<a name=320:21></a> 2.<a name=320:22></a> All who profess the gospel must live till the end, and be judged on the earth.<a name=320:23></a> Further, thirdly, it is those who are called, not chosen; they are not saved, or verse 14 contradicts verse 11.<a name=320:24></a> All this is but to save themselves.<a name=320:25></a> In Matthew 25, the Lord says, "I know you not.<a name=320:26></a>" This is not so if they are only rejected for the kingdom.<a name=320:27></a> If they mean that those who are excluded from the kingdom will be judged all the same before the great white throne, Matthew 25: 41-46 shews that it will not be so.<a name=320:28></a>

		[<i>To the same</i>.<a name=326:1></a>] Mrs.<a name=326:2></a> Lancy, There is a principle which we must keep in mind in reading prophecy; that is, that the prophet takes up circumstances near his eye, and in which the faith of God's people were then concerned, going on to ulterior and final events in which the government of God should be displayed and closed.<a name=326:3></a> The transition from one to another is not always at once perceptible: still, once the principle is recognised, it is generally easy to see where it passes from one to the other.<a name=326:4></a> A notable instance is in Joel, when a plague of caterpillars and other destructive insects prefigures the northern army at the end of the age, to which the prophet then turns, yet not losing sight of the question of earthly plenty, as you may see.<a name=326:5></a> Yet the language changes in chapter 1: 15.<a name=326:6></a> It is abhorred before it was there.<a name=326:7></a> Yet in chapter 2 the images are kept up, and, chapter 3: 24-25, distinctly alluded to.<a name=326:8></a> In Isaiah 19 it begins with the present things: in verse 16 it <i>begins</i> to pass on to the ultimate events, taking present judgments as the image.<a name=326:9></a> The inroads of Nebuchadnezzar are the prefigurement and <i>partially</i> the commencement of final judgments, because all are part of the government of God.<a name=326:10></a> Chapter 20 is a special prophecy as to an earlier attack by <i>Assyria</i> on Egypt.<a name=326:11></a> Tartan, it appears, was a title, general, or some such thing.<a name=326:12></a> Sargon was, it seems, founder of a new dynasty just before Sennacherib .<a name=326:13></a>.<a name=326:14></a>.<a name=326:15></a> .<a name=326:16></a>

		[Mr Beddom] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I should have been very glad to have seen you, and shall be so still, if the Lord so orders it.<a name=328:11></a> Meanwhile I will answer your letter briefly.<a name=328:12></a> I could not, of course, present myself as a Baptist, because I could not be one, and necessarily could not say I was, nor of any sect.<a name=328:13></a> It would violate my whole conscience in the church of God, and in these last days especially, for I do not doubt either that we are in them.<a name=328:14></a> I feel it is of the last importance to keep my testimony distinct -- I mean distinctly in that truth which I believe the Lord would maintain as His own.<a name=328:15></a> I should receive a Baptist or an Independent cordially as a Christian, but I could not give any other testimony than what I believe to be the truth.<a name=328:16></a> I am very glad you preach the gospel wherever the Lord opens a door.<a name=328:17></a> But I apprehend your desire to have access has led you to dim a part of that truth which might have seemed likely to shut the door to you.<a name=328:18></a> Do not suppose I am judging you; I speak simply from the contents of your letter.<a name=328:19></a> I doubt that faith is shewn in lowering my own position from the light I have, to <i>coalesce</i> with that which has it not.<a name=328:20></a> I may adapt my teaching to all persons in grace, but not adapt myself to their want of teaching.<a name=328:21></a> I have seen, dear brother, those who get into the forms of brethren, who had no faith in the reality of the unity of Christ's body, and who -- when the support of those forms failed them -- naturally sank, from not personally holding on to Christ according to the power of that truth, into the common course of what then might surround them.<a name=328:22></a> But such are not upon equal ground of blessing with those they have last got amongst them -- [that of] the light which the others have left -- because they have not the conscience of having left any.<a name=328:23></a> I think it very likely, from what I know of the gathering of M.<a name=328:24></a> at the time you were there, that there was very little light or feeling as to the church being the body of Christ, and that it ought to shew itself as such in the earth; so I am not surprised it should not have had much hold on your mind.<a name=328:25></a> What I should say to you would be to preach as earnestly and as devotedly as you can, to seek the salvation of the souls around you, and search the word diligently to see if there was not an unity of the body of Christ through the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven, and hence if sects are not wrong.<a name=328:26></a> See if that presence of the Holy Ghost be not a first principle of Christianity.<a name=328:27></a> I dare say, if you wished it, some tracts or books on these subjects which would serve as finger-posts to you might be sent down.<a name=328:28></a> The scriptures would, of course, remain as the treasury of the truth itself.<a name=328:29></a> We facilitate our path by running into the channels dug by men for the current of Christianity to run in, but we do not always maintain the testimony of the word by it.<a name=328:30></a>

		As to the Lord's coming.<a name=328:31></a> It is not the subject always to bring to souls, though connected even with conversion by Paul to the Thessalonians; but at least it ought to be everywhere the expression of our own hope, so that it should be confessed and known to be our hope.<a name=328:32></a> Thus I may use it with the best wisdom I have for others, but it ought to be known as my faith with them who have to say to me -- as my faith, not my opinion.<a name=328:33></a> I do not doubt that Louis Napoleon is doing his own part assigned of God in preparing the way of forming the Latin empire, but no man can say he is personally to be the head, because scripture has not said it.<a name=328:34></a> It is a mere man's opinion.<a name=328:35></a> I do not believe even that the head of the beast is antichrist at all.<a name=328:36></a> I believe that the second beast is antichrist (Revelation 13), not the first.<a name=328:37></a> But, I add, to me the Lord's coming is not a question of prophecy, but my present hope.<a name=328:38></a> Events before His judging the quick are the subject of prophecy; His coming to receive the church is our present, heavenly hope.<a name=328:39></a> There is no event between me and <i>heaven</i>.<a name=328:40></a> There are between this time and Christ's judgment of the earth.<a name=328:41></a> Now we are blessed <i>with</i> Christ; as His bride and His body, we appear with Him, reign with Him: the great peculiar blessing of the church is being associated with Christ Himself.<a name=328:42></a> The government of the world is another thing; prophecy lights up that as a candle in a dark place, but I am o the day.<a name=328:43></a> It is this especially <i>Christians</i> have to learn that they are one with Christ, blessed with Him.<a name=328:44></a> And this applies to everything.<a name=328:45></a> "<i>My</i> peace I give unto you" -- "That they may have <i>my</i> joy fulfilled in themselves" -- "The glory which thou hast given me I have given them" -- "That the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them" -- "I have given them the words which thou gavest unto me" -- "I go to my Father and your Father; my God and your God.<a name=328:46></a>" This brings perfect love so close to our hearts that it is very precious, and thus we nourish ourselves with that love.<a name=328:47></a>

		Dear G V Wigram, -- Here and in the U.<a name=336:1></a>S.<a name=336:2></a> the church and the world are more mixed than even in England, so that the testimony of brethren is more definite and important as far as the sphere goes, and things seem to point to an awakening as to this in the States.<a name=336:3></a> I have been invited to more than one point: how the Lord will lead I know not.<a name=336:4></a> In this place there is no very apparent fruit in the meeting.<a name=336:5></a> Two have been restored, but I think a working of the testimony in the consciences around, more perhaps than anywhere.<a name=336:6></a> Only Toronto would be compared.<a name=336:7></a> Several have found peace -- one who had fallen into infidelity -- and a full salvation, a translating into the kingdom of God's dear Son, the church, the Lord's coming, have laid hold and deeply exercised the consciences of many.<a name=336:8></a> At Toronto I have a larger congregation.<a name=336:9></a> Here the very work in souls made them afraid, and get warnings, though the last indeed is the case in Toronto.<a name=336:10></a> At Guelph, where our conference was, the growth of the assembly has been rapid since.<a name=336:11></a> I suppose, the Lord willing, I shall go when I take it as my starting-point for sleighing on into the bush and the shores of Lake Huron, where I am expected.<a name=336:12></a> I do trust the Lord will keep up and deepen even the awakening of souls in this place.<a name=336:13></a> The American habit of joining a church for respectability makes the church regularly worldly, but there are a good many Christians, but in a dead state.<a name=336:14></a> In Canada there are about 250 brethren, and walking intelligently and happily everywhere.<a name=336:15></a> The great instrument of this really was E.<a name=336:16></a>, though of course others have laboured in detail, but all was confusion till he was here.<a name=336:17></a> We are now in snow and I am old; but save a day or two, no very violent cold, scarcely calling to wrap up as much as in England, but it is coming, I suppose, with Christmas .<a name=336:18></a>.<a name=336:19></a>.<a name=336:20></a> .<a name=336:21></a> I have got on a considerable way -- chapter 15 -- with the Revelation for the Synopsis, having at last felt led to take it up fully.<a name=336:22></a> You will have seen the "Brethren and their Reviewers.<a name=336:23></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		I cannot but feel that the Lord is working here, and that my journey here was most timely.<a name=336:24></a> There is nothing of <i>clat</i>; but in these last days a solemn settling of principle which will under grace be important for this country, nay, for the whole continent.<a name=336:25></a> The foundation of the truth as to the church's position, its hopes and its salvation, have been brought home to all classes of Christians, and the authority of scriptures singularly exercised its power in their consciences.<a name=336:26></a> This too has strengthened the brethren.<a name=336:27></a> The Lord only knows the result.<a name=336:28></a> We must only work on while it is called today.<a name=336:29></a> My kindest love to the brethren, and thanks for all their kind interest in me and my work.<a name=336:30></a> May they be blessed in the fruit of their prayers, and in their own souls too.<a name=336:31></a>

		[R T Grant] DEAR BROTHER, -- You will, I trust, have got my letter.<a name=337:1></a> I gave you some account of -- .<a name=337:2></a> It is so far difficult that there is nothing very striking or salient, though it seems to me the Lord is evidently working.<a name=337:3></a> Souls have been added to the assembly; but it is not so much this as the working of truth in many, in which the Lord's hand seems to be manifest.<a name=337:4></a> Then, of course, too, opposition has been at work: it is all a useful experience of patience.<a name=337:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But our spring of labour must be in the Lord, not in effects.<a name=337:6></a> He has to say, "Then have I laboured in vain and spent my strength for nought and in vain: yet is my judgment with the Lord and my work with my God.<a name=337:7></a>" We are often encouraged as He never was, but we must depend on Him for energy to work.<a name=337:8></a> Perhaps I am wrong to say "never," for the woman at the well of Samaria evidently was sent to His soul, when driven by jealousy out of Judaea, and one anxious soul shewed Him the fields white for harvest, and gave Him meat to eat man knew not of.<a name=337:9></a> But we must be in the secret of the Lord to have this kind of encouragement.<a name=337:10></a> Perfect grace in Him gave Him to see the bearing and import of the working of grace in others and the immensity of such facts; so in the poor woman (Mary) who anointed His feet in Bethany.<a name=337:11></a> But then He is a source of strength and blessing and encouragement to us which, though perfect in communion with His Father, He had not, because He enters into all our difficulties and infirmities, and loneliness -- has a word in season to speak to him that is weary, as having passed through the sorrows.<a name=337:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have known much what it is to have little retirement in the villages of France and Switzerland.<a name=337:13></a> But where there is the earnest desire of it, and we are in the path of the Lord's will, He makes opportunities for us, and makes -- when there is diligence -- our opportunities profitable by His grace.<a name=337:14></a> We have in such cases to use diligence to seize moments, but even in going from one place to another, if alone, we find such, and richer sometimes than longer times where there is not the same diligence of heart with God.<a name=337:15></a> And then be sure moments of longer duration have a value which otherwise they would not, and are rescued from <i>idle</i> intercourse otherwise.<a name=337:16></a> Still it is always of the last importance to take care we have always moments of communion, as nothing can supply their place, and our work flows from God when we have; and there is the seriousness and earnestness of dealing in God's behalf with souls in their eternal interest.<a name=337:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think we ought to look for fruits as a sign that God is working with us, but it should not be the spring of labour, but our intercourse with Him so as to have His mind.<a name=337:18></a> Peace be with you, dearest brother, and may He give you to be much with Him.<a name=337:19></a>

		[R T Grant] [<i>To the same</i>.<a name=338:1></a>] DEAREST BROTHER, -- I should not have suggested such a plan to you as you speak of.<a name=338:2></a> I feel in such cases that gift and all else must find their own level, and my hearty desire would be, I need not say, to have labourers in the Lord's vineyard.<a name=338:3></a> It must depend on your own consciousness of the Lord's calling.<a name=338:4></a> But if you feel that there is not a call for work which absorbs your time, I believe that you would have more energy for work if you were occupied in some way.<a name=338:5></a> But if you have energy, and are drawn out into the work so as to fill up all your time, I should be very sorry to see you spend it in other labour.<a name=338:6></a> There is another consideration; occupation would, I suppose, tie you to one place, and if your gift is evangelising, this might be a hindrance, if visiting it would not at all.<a name=338:7></a> I think your selling about something would be a very good testimony, and would not hinder your giving it up if you felt your heart led out to work.<a name=338:8></a> Do not let momentary discouragement form your judgment.<a name=338:9></a> I sought at first to do something myself as a testimony that it was an honourable path, but was so called hither and thither for work that I never really entered on it.<a name=338:10></a> I believe that the work of -- is forming itself, and hence do not doubt that the movement of active brethren may take a more definite shape.<a name=338:11></a> If you find a door open, go on.<a name=338:12></a> If you have not, and you find anything to do, do it by all means.<a name=338:13></a> I believe it would be a good example.<a name=338:14></a> If you can do both -- by all means.<a name=338:15></a> But if you find your time occupied with work for the Lord, work on.<a name=338:16></a> If, in spite of seeking souls, you have time on your hands, it is a very good thing you should employ it.<a name=338:17></a> We had brethren in France who worked at some trade, one a watchmaker in the summer and harvest, and evangelised all the winter, when the people were free, and several have done something -- one of them, one of the most efficient labourers we have; but it does not hinder his work, for he is very active.<a name=338:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If you have time necessarily unemployed, get some good work for necessary uses, but do not be discouraged because at first souls do not fall into your hands.<a name=338:19></a> It is quite right not to be a burden if we can, but at the same time you should think of the work, not of that.<a name=338:20></a> It would be a loss to leave Christ's work merely to live.<a name=338:21></a> Christ has ordained that they that preach the gospel should live of the gospel.<a name=338:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is to my mind wholly a question whether you find in Christ's work real occupation for your time in evangelising and visiting.<a name=338:23></a> If not, then it is all quite right you should fill up the remainder.<a name=338:24></a> <i>In that case</i> labour would only, I think, strengthen your hands for the Lord's work.<a name=338:25></a> If you gave up any part of His work for it, it would be a mistake.<a name=338:26></a> You have then to see if the energy which sets to work is in exercise.<a name=338:27></a> Let Christ's work be the governing and principal thought.<a name=338:28></a>

		[R T Grant] [<i>To the same</i>.<a name=340:1></a>] DEAREST BROTHER, -- I was glad to hear you were occupied and found openings.<a name=340:2></a> I judge any occupation, such as commercial traveller (which I mention because some one said you thought of it), would engross you, and lead you where divinely-given work might not be.<a name=340:3></a> All I should think of, supposing your time was not fully occupied, would be to do something which would fill it up, which you could relinquish when service called.<a name=340:4></a> In a wild country this is even easier than in an old one, only it requires a little faith and energy.<a name=340:5></a> If you found you were not called in your heart to work, that is a different question.<a name=340:6></a> It depends on our love to souls.<a name=340:7></a> God draws out our hearts after them when He moves us to serve Him in these things.<a name=340:8></a> Then it is a great matter to follow the Lord's leading where His Spirit is working, and, above all, self-sacrifice and devotedness: this, above all, I feel to be the great matter.<a name=340:9></a>

		There is another thing that you will have to consider, that is, that true work is not like ordination to an office where a routine is to be gone through, and, if blessing comes, it is all well.<a name=340:10></a> There are exercises of soul; there is, even when we have the truest desire to serve, so much in us that has to be exercised to fit us for service.<a name=340:11></a> You might say, did not Paul preach at once?<a name=340:12></a> Yes; but he was then set aside for some years till Barnabas went to seek him.<a name=340:13></a> Moses was forty years thus set aside.<a name=340:14></a> Now I do not say that every one is thus, as to the form of it, set aside; but as to the flesh -- making nothing of us -- it is true.<a name=340:15></a> It may be by, as to men, a little valued exercise as to ministry, so as to be cast on the Lord, and our motives purified; or, where more-exercised gifts are, so that, though we may work with blessing in less conspicuous spheres, notice is elsewhere.<a name=340:16></a> This is not a question of gift exactly, but that maturing of the vessel which connects gift with the state of soul, so as to give on the one hand subjection, earnestness, and seriousness; and enables the labourer to connect truth with the souls of his hearers.<a name=340:17></a> Now when the Lord calls us and exercises us thus, we may often be occupied partially with other occupations, as not having our time filled.<a name=340:18></a> I should not feel happy at the thought of seeking one's mere livelihood, if called to serve the Lord, through anything like a want of faith.<a name=340:19></a> It mars faith for the work itself, just as mere worldly occupation or attention to men, however amiable.<a name=340:20></a> We are not our own; "occupy till I come" is the word.<a name=340:21></a> All I look for in the last case I have put is where work does not call.<a name=340:22></a> It is healthful not to charge the church.<a name=340:23></a> It is not healthful to neglect work where it does call, not healthful even to our own souls.<a name=340:24></a> Our heavenly Father knows we have need of all these things.<a name=340:25></a> We have also to consider the difference of gift.<a name=340:26></a> All is not public speaking; visits, reading meetings are as important in their own way as public discourses, sometimes work when other work cannot be done .<a name=340:27></a>.<a name=340:28></a>.<a name=340:29></a> .<a name=340:30></a>

		My earnest hope would be that the Lord has called you to work.<a name=340:31></a> But suppose (I do not in the least judge so, or the contrary) the Lord had given you more of a pastor's and teacher's work than an evangelist's, this naturally requires more maturity even for the teaching, still more for pastorship.<a name=340:32></a> During the process we might, in a measure, spare the burden to the church: if it dragged us out of the exercise of the gift or the service which matured for us, it would be a great pity.<a name=340:33></a> In a certain sense I believe I was put into official ministry immaturely; but I know God makes all things work together for good to those who love Him.<a name=340:34></a> You are perhaps as happily placed for growing up into ministry as may be.<a name=340:35></a> If anything which leaves you free you could do, as I said in my last, it would be so far a testimony.<a name=340:36></a> Elders (Acts 20), though counted worthy of double honour, are exhorted to labour for their temporal wants.<a name=340:37></a> A moving evangelist would find it very hard unless he had a Paul's energy.<a name=340:38></a> If brethren are scattered, not having a home is an advantage: one does not waste just half one's strength in returning to it.<a name=340:39></a> It greatly facilitates the work.<a name=340:40></a> I have largely worked in this way.<a name=340:41></a> If the work is local, save occasional visits to a distance, where one may stay a night, it is better to have one, a <i>gte</i> of some sort.<a name=340:42></a>

		Dearest C McAdam, -- I feel the seriousness of the crisis or position in which the testimony of the saints of God is placed by the controversy which is going on.<a name=343:1></a> It has, in a certain sense, come to me by surprise.<a name=343:2></a> And I am perhaps, in a certain sense, better able to feel it by being at a distance.<a name=343:3></a> I am in no hurry, but I feel it very sorrowful on one side, and very encouraging -- uncommonly so -- on the other.<a name=343:4></a> When the tract came out on the "Righteousness of God," I had not the remotest idea of the tumult that would ensue, nor, I may add, of the low state in which the evangelical body, as such, stood.<a name=343:5></a> God (I am well and thankfully assured) will never leave His own, but the professing body seems to me to be breaking up into Puseyites -- who (as the Pope said to some of them lately -- not ill) are as the church bells who call the people into it, but are always outside it themselves -- on the one hand, and rationalists on the other; while the evangelicals are incapable of holding with power any truth to maintain what exists.<a name=343:6></a> This brings out any true testimony, if made public, into a very special place.<a name=343:7></a> They are making that that is amongst us public by their attacks.<a name=343:8></a> I believe it to be the one true scriptural ground of the church of God, and with that, the true, full gospel of grace.<a name=343:9></a> That I have felt, as all well know, for years.<a name=343:10></a> But this breaking up of what Establishment or Dissent held, the public place of profession, even if a lower ground, brings out the truth into that place, not as assuming it, but as the necessary consequence of the attacks against it.<a name=343:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But I do not think that we have anything to do but to pursue peaceably onward the testimony we have, seeking, above all, its realisation in true devotedness, and practical separation from the world.<a name=343:12></a> No part of the testimony of God is more important than this, a greater witness that we are not of it, that we follow Christ.<a name=343:13></a> I dread the saints getting tired of unworldliness.<a name=343:14></a> It was the first decay of Christianity; it is always our danger.<a name=343:15></a> It is often what gives falsehood its power over the conscience of the world.<a name=343:16></a> They see motives that master what masters them.<a name=343:17></a> This may be imitated to propagate error, but truth and goodness should have it naturally of the Lord.<a name=343:18></a> I feel very anxious for this as to brethren.<a name=343:19></a> I do not doubt that full truth and grace is the weapon of God, but the vessel that carries should be the devoted effect of the truth and grace it speaks of -- <i>this</i>, and that the Word should be held fast in all its integrity.<a name=343:20></a> Multitudes I doubt not, and indeed so have heard, who would reject the stupid inanities of the "Essays and Reviews," or of Colenso, yet have their natural unbelief set free, and the word of God has lost its absolute authority.<a name=343:21></a> This works two ways: one sets reasons (this is human will) above all -- man may believe this or that, but he does not believe God; or, in the weariness of the want of some authority, some rest, men turn to the authority of the church, and are degraded from a reliance on a holy God to reliance on corrupt man.<a name=343:22></a> The acknowledgment of the holy scriptures is of the essence of the acknowledgment of God now, and our security; though the revelation of a personal God whom we can trust, known through Jesus, is eternal life and blessing.<a name=343:23></a>

		I am daily more struck with the connection of the great principles on which my mind was exercised by and with God, when I found salvation and peace, and the questions agitated and agitating the world at the present day: the absolute, divine authority and certainty of the Word, as a divine link between us and God, if everything (church and world) went; personal assurance of salvation in a new condition by being in Christ; the church as His body; Christ coming to receive us to Himself; and collaterally with that, the setting up of a new earthly dispensation, from Isaiah 32 (more particularly the end); all this was when laid aside at E.<a name=343:24></a>P.<a name=343:25></a>'s in 1827; the house character of the assembly on earth (not the fact of the presence of the Spirit) was subsequently.<a name=343:26></a> It was a vague fact which received form in my mind long after, that there must be a wholly new order of things, if God was to have His way, and the craving of the heart after it I had felt long before; but the church and redemption I did not know till the time I have spoken of; but eight years before, universal sorrow and sin pressed upon my spirit.<a name=343:27></a> I did not think to say so much of myself; but it is all well.<a name=343:28></a> The truth remains the truth, and it is on that we have to go; but the Lord's dealings with the soul, connected with the use of truth, have to be noted.<a name=343:29></a>

		There are conversions by no means unfrequently, and souls brought to peace.<a name=348:16></a> We have had from among them, as from other Christians seeing clear, pretty constant additions to the gathering.<a name=348:17></a> But truth, proving Christians, as in our place, is working largely and sometimes deeply in many minds.<a name=348:18></a> First it is the enjoyment of the blessed truth of our relationship to Christ and the Father, and Christ's coming, and then comes the discovery by the persons and their friends that this means breaking with the world -- by ministers, that it means leaving their place or losing their flocks; then it is a land that eats up the inhabitants thereof, or fear to come there if there is a work; then wants of souls that bring them back -- sometimes staying away with a bad conscience: in Hamilton particularly, but also in Toronto, this has been going on -- quiet, humble, dropping in meanwhile and enjoying.<a name=348:19></a> We have been preached against, and it has frightened some and strengthened others, who saw the truth was with us -- led others to inquire.<a name=348:20></a> There are many in H.<a name=348:21></a> deeply exercised, and some here .<a name=348:22></a>.<a name=348:23></a>.<a name=348:24></a> .<a name=348:25></a> I can pray for them now, which is a comfort to me.<a name=348:26></a> I felt I ought to be able to reckon more on Christ for them.<a name=348:27></a> I felt as if the children were come to the birth, and there was not strength to bring forth.<a name=348:28></a> I blamed myself for this, lest there should be knowledge without Christ enough for motive.<a name=348:29></a> This is what is going on in a great many souls, and some when they found the real blessing thought we did not sufficiently bring forward these truths.<a name=348:30></a> But really foundations have to be laid, and we must give meat in due season.<a name=348:31></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This, though I leave it all to the Lord, exercises me as to staying here sometimes.<a name=348:32></a> I of course thought to be back in the fine season: I do still; but when I see the work widening and deepening, it is difficult to fix a moment, and should it link on to the States seriously, it would be yet another ground of prayer.<a name=348:33></a> It has even crossed my mind that I might return and come back again if the Lord so willed.<a name=348:34></a> I am growing old, but having once crossed, it is not so formidable; and I have nothing to do but to serve Christ.<a name=348:35></a> He knows the future and I do not.<a name=348:36></a> Of the two I am better here in health than in England.<a name=348:37></a> I have work, and am anxious about it, in both England and France.<a name=348:38></a> At present I leave it, even in my mind, in the Lord's hands -- thank God it is surely there, and I am happy to serve while it is called today.<a name=348:39></a> But I have received the deepest and profoundest conviction, that the truth that the brethren have been taught of God is the special testimony of God for these days, and these are serious days -- the last days.<a name=348:40></a> Our path is simply to seek the good of souls, as much as lies in us to live peaceably with all men, but to hold fast the testimony God has given us, to keep His word and not deny His name.<a name=348:41></a> Then I confess I look earnestly for devotedness in myself and in all.<a name=348:42></a>

		[F G Patterson] MY DEAR BROTHER -- I was very glad to get your letter, and to know too that the Lord has thus far blessed you and led you on.<a name=353:1></a> Your littleness is anything but a reason for the Lord's not caring for you, or -- I may truly say -- my own unfeigned interest in your blessing.<a name=353:2></a> You may believe that my heart had not forgotten you.<a name=353:3></a> I suppose I shall return, the Lord willing, to England this summer.<a name=353:4></a> I shall have much study work to do in London, but if allowed shall be most glad to come and see you.<a name=353:5></a> I have to seek, of course, that my steps may be guided of the Lord in the work, for He has His own work and His own way.<a name=353:6></a> I am thankful you are free.<a name=353:7></a>

		The more I go on, the more I approach the glory and rest that remains to us, the more I see how sad the condition of soul of most Christians is.<a name=353:8></a> I have just travelled some 2,000 miles, of which 1,800 in the United States.<a name=353:9></a> It has brought home to me with fresh present consciousness how sad the state of things is -- a certain measure of outward evangelical activity, but minds absorbed by worldly activity, the word of God without power, spirituality almost unknown.<a name=353:10></a> Surely there are exceptions, but that is what characterises the state of things.<a name=353:11></a> The non-professing world in the States is wicked to a degree; blasphemous language to excess -- in the east drunkenness dominant, lawlessness of spirit everywhere, and corruption of manners.<a name=353:12></a> Yet I do not doubt there are many saints.<a name=353:13></a> But Americans do not deny this: little family life; young married people go and live in hotels for cheapness, and corruption is rife there; and those who have houses go to the hotels to find company and spend the evenings, little at home.<a name=353:14></a> Yet it is a religious population, men would say: people join churches for respectability, but christian life is feebleness itself.<a name=353:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have seen too the universal state, not confined to America, that those who are converted are as if outside God's house and circle, and desiring, hoping, praying that it may be well with them, and that they may be found within; but not in adoption within, seeking to live up to their place -- the true liberty which is in Christ.<a name=353:16></a> I do anything but despise this, I was a good while so myself; but it lowers the whole tone and character of Christianity.<a name=353:17></a> The only safe state, so to speak then, is rigid legality and devotedness on that ground -- a kind of Thomas  Kempis life.<a name=353:18></a> To know that we are risen with Christ, in Him before God, alters all.<a name=353:19></a> It sets us free before Him, and free from the power of what was contrary to Him.<a name=353:20></a> He is our life, and accepted before God, our path is through the wilderness towards Him.<a name=353:21></a> Blessed thought!<a name=353:22></a> soon we shall see Him, and be with Him in unhindered adoration of heart for ever.<a name=353:23></a>

		DEAR MR.<a name=355:1></a> GOVERNOR,<a href="#355:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> -- You will perhaps recollect one who went up in the train from E.<a name=355:2></a> to D.<a name=355:3></a>, now about a year ago, or not far from it, and be surprised perhaps to receive a letter from him from Canada.<a name=355:4></a> But though I have been much occupied -- as you may suppose I did not cross the Atlantic for nothing -- I have not forgotten our conversation in the train, and I crave to hear how you are getting on.<a name=355:5></a> We have had here the Governor of the Jail fully brought to the knowledge of salvation, and to walk with the saints of God, as he still does.<a name=355:6></a> (He would still like another place, but awaits the Lord's leading to find him something.<a name=355:7></a>) His dear wife, already a believer, was led to see she ought to be more entirely separate from the world and live more devotedly, and so she did thoroughly, and the Lord has taken her.<a name=355:8></a> She expected it, and was longing to go.<a name=355:9></a> No cloud came over her peace and joy.<a name=355:10></a> She suffered dreadfully and long, but no impatience was shewn; all was bright and all peace.<a name=355:11></a> She left four children, charming little ones; we had them in the house where I was, to spare the nurse while she was ill.<a name=355:12></a> She saw them, gave them her blessing, and bade farewell, but it raised no lingering look behind.<a name=355:13></a> Another dear old man, only six months converted, died just after, rejoicing with all his heart.<a name=355:14></a> We buried both not far apart in the deep, deep snow, which indeed kept the earth soft enough to be opened (for sometimes they cannot bury), committing them to Christ till the resurrection.<a name=355:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And now how would it be with you if thus called?<a name=355:16></a> Is all peace and right with God?<a name=355:17></a> You know yourself that you need it.<a name=355:18></a> You know that Christ is the only way to have it.<a name=355:19></a> Let me add a few words as to the fulness of it.<a name=355:20></a> He appeared once in the end of the world to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself.<a name=355:21></a> That work is finished.<a name=355:22></a> It can never be added to, nor taken away from.<a name=355:23></a> Its value does not change.<a name=355:24></a> But the Spirit of God works in us to shew us our need of it, makes us see that we are sinners, that we are <i>lost</i> in ourselves, leads us (perhaps by deep and painful convictions) to the sense that there is <i>no</i> good in us, that when even to will is present with us, how to perform that which is good we find not.<a name=355:25></a> We find not only that we have sinned, but that there is a law of sin in our members warring against the law of our mind, and bringing us into captivity to the law of sin in our members.<a name=355:26></a> But when -- really humbled about this and convicted in our own hearts, removing all pretensions of righteousness in ourselves -- we turn to Christ, we find that He has died for this, that He has been a sacrifice for sin as for the sins that burdened us -- has been made sin for us, has <i>put it away</i> for us by the sacrifice of Himself.<a name=355:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we get peace and liberty of heart before God, because the sin is put away between us and Him; Christ has made a full expiation.<a name=355:28></a> Sin does not exist as between God and us.<a name=355:29></a> When <i>He</i> looks on the blood of Christ He cannot see sin in the believer, because when Christ shed that blood He put it away.<a name=355:30></a> Thus we get liberty and power too, because submitting thus to the righteousness of God, having Christ for our righteousness, we are sealed with the Spirit, which gives us power and shews us Christ, so that we get strength and joy, and are able to glorify Him.<a name=355:31></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How is it then with you?<a name=355:32></a> Are you still a worse prisoner than those you are watching over, or freed by the redemption that is in Christ?<a name=355:33></a> Have you been brought to see, that if you refuse life through His name you must perish?<a name=355:34></a> Do you seek that you should know Him, or are you joining with His enemies -- hail-fellow-well-met with the world that to its judgment and ruin crucified Him?<a name=355:35></a> If we have His Spirit we know that we are in Him, and all is peace and joy too, because we know the Son of God and abound in hope through the power of the Holy Ghost.<a name=355:36></a> I shall be glad to hear from you.<a name=355:37></a> May the blessed Lord in His grace direct your eye fixedly on Christ.<a name=355:38></a>

		DEAREST BROTHER, -- It seems to me unreasonable that gatherings should be called upon to give out names, with their own responsibility engaged thereby, and not have an opportunity of objecting or delaying.<a name=357:1></a> The Saturday meeting had for its object that those interested in the various gatherings should have an opportunity of fellowship and consultation, so as to effect concurrent action.<a name=357:2></a> That they bound anything is an utterly false accusation; and the way the enemy has sought to assail this meeting, through unprincipled attacks or personal feeling, is a proof to me that it is of God.<a name=357:3></a> The reading out the names even in the gatherings <i>concludes</i> nothing, for the very object is, that if there be objection it may be mentioned .<a name=357:4></a>.<a name=357:5></a>.<a name=357:6></a> .<a name=357:7></a> But it was long ago felt that it was desirable that a name should not be publicly given out until all practical inquiry was made, as it was very disagreeable to have a name publicly mentioned, and demur made thereto on moral grounds, when it could be avoided.<a name=357:8></a> Hence the previous inquiry and consultation.<a name=357:9></a> Till they are announced to be received, nothing is officially done, but the previous inquiry is the ground on which that takes place.<a name=357:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, the testimony of the local gatherings must be relied on, and that is to be desired; but it would not be, if the others were precluded from saying anything where they may possibly have something.<a name=357:11></a> And surely, if I am to give out people's names, I must have liberty to make a difficulty if I have one; and the case has arisen, and the previous inquiry just what gives efficiency to this process.<a name=357:12></a> If brethren who care for the saints were present from all the gatherings, mutual consultation and godly care would take place; and, while they could not, and are not meant to decide anything, they could bring the names, or anything else, before all the gatherings, with adequate previous inquiry, so that things should not be done rashly.<a name=357:13></a> Confidence would be produced in common action.<a name=357:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The notion of -- I totally repudiate.<a name=357:15></a> London is not as large as Galatia.<a name=357:16></a> It is utterly false, and there was no agglomerated population, where a person could walk on a Sunday morning to another part of the town, perhaps when under questions of discipline, where he resided .<a name=357:17></a>.<a name=357:18></a>.<a name=357:19></a> .<a name=357:20></a> But I go on the facts; the analogy is wholly and practically false.<a name=357:21></a> The difficulties are practically great in London, but with cordial co-operation they disappear; and I believe in the power of the Spirit of God to overcome the difficulties which arise from the immense size of the town, and produce common action.<a name=357:22></a> If every one will go his own way it cannot be; but you have independent churches and members of them.<a name=357:23></a> In Galatia a man was of a local church, and if he went to another place took a letter of commendation.<a name=357:24></a> Could I take one, say from the page, every Sunday morning I went down to page or K.<a name=357:25></a>?<a name=357:26></a> We are necessarily one body in London, and with grace can so walk.<a name=357:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I mourn these efforts to dislocate the united action hitherto carried out, but as yet will hope that we may not have the testimony that we have not enough of the power of God's Spirit to overcome the practical difficulties, but are obliged to confess that we give up the testimony to the unity of God's church in London.<a name=357:28></a> -- 's practical independency, or congregationalism, I repudiate with every energy I am capable of.<a name=357:29></a> What I earnestly desire is, the cordial co-operation of brethren to maintain common order in one body according to the scriptures and the unity of the Spirit of God; and I earnestly pray that the beloved brethren in London may be kept in grace seeking it, in the faithful desire of union, and service in lowliness of heart, and I am sure of the faithfulness of God to help them, and carry it out in grace for them.<a name=357:30></a> May the Lord bless and keep them.<a name=357:31></a> I have laboured with them, and suffered with them, and trust the Lord that He will bless them in the unity of the Spirit of God.<a name=357:32></a> May they remember that there is one Spirit and one body.<a name=357:33></a>

		Next, was He the second Adam here on earth?<a name=360:11></a> Personally no doubt He was, but not properly.<a name=360:12></a> As the first Adam was not actually head of a race before his fall, and hence, not in this special sense first man Adam, though personally he clearly was so -- though not as head of a race; so Christ was not the head of a race till He had accomplished the work of redemption and began a new position for us as risen.<a name=360:13></a> But personally He had life in Himself, and could quicken, and did; but He had not taken the place of second Adam to be the head of a race till He was risen.<a name=360:14></a> "Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abides alone.<a name=360:15></a>" And it is the risen Man that will have all men subject to Him in the millennium -- nay, He is glorified (Ephesians 1): He died too, rose and revived, that He might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.<a name=360:16></a> Personally He had a title, for all things were created by Him and for Him.<a name=360:17></a> But consistently with God's character and His glory, He could only take it consequent on redemption.<a name=360:18></a> He is thus as man made Lord and Christ.<a name=360:19></a> As Son of God He quickens whom He will, but this is not head of a race as last Adam.<a name=360:20></a> There He is man, according to God's counsels, in a new position.<a name=360:21></a> Hence the "sure mercies of David" are based on and cited as a proof of His resurrection.<a name=360:22></a> The Lord will be for ever the man, head of all others, in glory; only that second and last refer to time circumstances.<a name=360:23></a> Last Adam is as none coming after Him, not as closing the Adamic race, unless, indeed, that is what you mean.<a name=360:24></a> But the Adamic race is not closed actually save for faith.<a name=360:25></a> God since the cross holds it for lost and condemned, while dealing in infinite grace with it as such.<a name=360:26></a> Faith sees it is all over with it, since it has rejected Christ; its moral history is closed.<a name=360:27></a> The ends of the world have come upon us, and the judgment of the world (morally, not its execution, of course) took place in the cross.<a name=360:28></a>

		[Dr.<a name=364:1></a> C Wolston] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I was very glad to get your account of the work, and so happy a one.<a name=364:2></a> I am sure true devotedness is the secret of power, and specially in these days; and that the value of brethren can only be if we so live in service for Christ, and for Christ specially among the poor: sunapavgete toi'" tapeinoi'", not "condescend" as so falsely translated in English.<a name=364:3></a> (Romans 12: 16.<a name=364:4></a>) We must remember that we are in the last days.<a name=364:5></a> Things are even going very fast, but the Lord is above all: He gathers together the tares in bundles.<a name=364:6></a> Patient continuing in well-doing is our path.<a name=364:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards your difficulty as to baptism, I am sure patience is our path there too.<a name=364:8></a> I can conceive nothing more false than a baptist testimony -- more poor than a baptist church: the whole thing is a mistake.<a name=364:9></a> We are, according to 2 Timothy 2, purging ourselves from evil in a great baptised mass, thinking to begin and found, as with heathen, in a false position.<a name=364:10></a> But there has been such confusion and abuse that one must have patience with those thrown on these ordinance-ways of correcting them.<a name=364:11></a> They do it conscientiously.<a name=364:12></a> I should not stir my finger to hinder their own acting for themselves.<a name=364:13></a> If it was made a part of the testimony of the assembly as such, I should not go to it.<a name=364:14></a> I should not make any fuss, but keep my own place.<a name=364:15></a> Dear -- assumed this position in -- that they baptised believers (himself the most inconsistent of men as to it) but admitted others.<a name=364:16></a> I said at once I could not go in that case: I went in the unity of the body, not on sufferance to a baptist meeting, and the thing was withdrawn, and said not to be meant in this way.<a name=364:17></a> Nothing would induce me to go to a baptist meeting; I would as soon go to popery.<a name=364:18></a> I should have objected to giving up the prayer meeting, and any <i>public</i> declaration of its being a part of their testimony; their private view of it, of course, they are free in.<a name=364:19></a> But we are called to peace.<a name=364:20></a> They attacked me once about it at -- , and I found they could not answer at all from scripture.<a name=364:21></a> The person who attacked me was convinced, I think, that they were wrong; certainly they had no answer from scripture.<a name=364:22></a> But I would not trouble one of them: I do not admit their baptism to be really such <i>at all</i>; but they do it conscientiously, and believe it such, and I am content, as I accept the ordinance as Christ's.<a name=364:23></a> They must leave my conscience free, too; I can bear with, but cannot bind my conscience by their ignorance, as I am sure it is.<a name=364:24></a> If the <i>assembly</i> takes the ground of being baptists, of course I should not go.<a name=364:25></a> But, I repeat, we are called to peace, and no individual (or multiplied by many) expression of opinion would move me at all.<a name=364:26></a> It always does mischief where it is held, and narrows the spirit; but when the assembly is not formed on it, I am free.<a name=364:27></a> Seek peace and pursue it.<a name=364:28></a> And the Lord give you peace always by all means.<a name=364:29></a>

		[R T Grant] BELOVED BROTHER, -- I was very glad indeed to get your letter and hear of the work in Canada, to which, as well as the beloved brethren there, I have become deeply attached.<a name=367:1></a> I know not if my years and strength will permit, but I still (if they I do) hope to visit America again; but, if allowed, should think of the States too, but that would properly require a younger, more energetic man, and we must look to the Lord to carry forward His own truth .<a name=367:2></a>.<a name=367:3></a>.<a name=367:4></a> .<a name=367:5></a> It is a matter of thankfulness to hear of the places opening, and our wisdom is to follow the Lord's leading in this.<a name=367:6></a> I do trust the blessed Spirit of God will continue His own work in spreading the truth in Canada, for it is God's truth and a blessing from Him, knitting the heart with Him according to His revelation of Himself, though accompanied with trial, as it surely will be.<a name=367:7></a> I see, too, the Lord more jealous of any evil among brethren than anywhere; they profess to have more truth, and He will not allow inconsistency with it, judges it, or puts them to shame.<a name=367:8></a> It is a blessing, surely; but still a solemn thought.<a name=367:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here the truth is spreading: I do not mean merely the numbers of brethren, and meetings increasing, though that is widely the case; I do not now know them all; but around us people are beginning to feel they are in the last days, and all is moving.<a name=367:10></a> They want something real; are holding meetings on the Lord's coming, and the like.<a name=367:11></a> The path of the brethren is simple in the midst of all this, to walk peacefully and graciously in the truth, but in it.<a name=367:12></a> All this stirs up others, and, feeling justly that the testimony of brethren is at the bottom of it all, they attack them with virulence.<a name=367:13></a> We are more hated and less despised than we were.<a name=367:14></a> The attacks are violent and unscrupulous, but often defeat themselves, and more strangers come to hear.<a name=367:15></a> I have felt the Lord with me since I returned, though a good deal knocked up with accumulated work and <i>this climate</i>; however, I have got on.<a name=367:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here the brethren are getting on happily, and with a deepened tone and more union than when I left.<a name=367:17></a> A real difficulty in this immense place where we have now eighteen gatherings, is to go on as one -- as separate in some sense as if they were twenty miles apart in the country, yet necessarily [all together] from being raised up in the same town.<a name=367:18></a> The Lord has graciously provided, too, more visiting, in sending one or two to London.<a name=367:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I daily see more how entirely new a place grace has set us in.<a name=367:20></a> One must not thereby set aside or weaken our responsibility in our old place, which Christ fully met as was needed for God's glory; but He has let us in by having perfectly glorified God in that work, into the holiest of all by the rent veil, to be partakers of all the holiness and of all the blessing that is there.<a name=367:21></a> I find new scenes of delight thus opening to me.<a name=367:22></a> I seek in my ministry to settle souls strong in the foundation, and have had interesting fresh developments of the progress of truth in Romans: meeting the old thing (chapter 3); resurrection, only as far as life (chapter 6): love first mentioned (though grace is in a general way alluded to in chapter 3) in chapter 5, and thus leading into the new Adam standing; and in chapter 8, after the discussion of law, bringing us into Christ and Christ in us.<a name=367:23></a> My mind is still working on this, that is, inquiring in scripture.<a name=367:24></a> I was greatly interested in connecting Titus 1: 2-3, John 1: 4, 1 John 1: 1-3, and 2 Timothy 1: 9-10.<a name=367:25></a> What a character it gives to the life we have now, going into the new and heavenly place by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, before the world, after all its present state, and out of it in spirit now, but (blessed be God) in communion with the Father and His Son Jesus Christ; our conversation and polivteuma in heaven.<a name=367:26></a> But I believe I must close.<a name=367:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord give you, dear brother, to keep very near Himself, and to remember that we are in the last days, and have to follow Christ wholly, and serve as those that wait for Him.<a name=367:28></a> Kindest love to the brethren, and the Lord bless your labours.<a name=367:29></a> I am finishing with two or three talking to me.<a name=367:30></a> I leave (D.<a name=367:31></a>V.<a name=367:32></a>) for Switzerland to-morrow.<a name=367:33></a>

		Everywhere I think the Spirit of God is at work, making men feel that Christianity ought to be something more real.<a name=371:15></a> But infidelity and denial of inspiration spread in an astonishing way, but I find in the Lord one is always happy.<a name=371:16></a> Did I look, as I once did, even unconsciously to anything here, I should be dismayed and overwhelmed; but I do feel the heavenward path and my home there every day more simply mine.<a name=371:17></a> I am here for one of the translations, which a good deal made me leave Canada when I did.<a name=371:18></a> The German I have not yet set to work at.<a name=371:19></a>

		[R T Grant] BELOVED BROTHER, -- I felt the death of dear -- more than I can tell you, just as he seemed to be coming out too into evangelising work.<a name=372:1></a> I felt the deepest interest in him and his countrymen, and it came upon me bowing my heart before the Lord, but I know all His ways are best and good; I have no doubt of His love or wisdom.<a name=372:2></a> That feeling was never weakened, but from His hand it spoke to the heart, not to arouse the will, but to bow implicitly to His wise and holy ways in a world of sorrow; but of His goodness I have no doubt.<a name=372:3></a> I am very glad you are a little amongst them: if you see them after receiving this, give them all my kindest love and truest sympathy.<a name=372:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the clergy, though you and I have been both somewhat in a similar way amongst them, we must only leave them to their own ways.<a name=372:5></a> It is sad, but all else is useless.<a name=372:6></a> I do not <i>expect</i> anything from them, when acting as such, but what is heartless and low.<a name=372:7></a> I have known many saints among them; but still I say, when acting in the spirit of their order, such (and the world knows it) is their character.<a name=372:8></a> There is a distinct loss of moral sense and sensibility.<a name=372:9></a> As a system, nobody can describe the horror I have of it, but in general I see no good in attacking them in any way: some I have personally much loved.<a name=372:10></a> As to Dr.<a name=372:11></a> C.<a name=372:12></a> and Dr.<a name=372:13></a> C.<a name=372:14></a>, I do not think much about it.<a name=372:15></a> One is so low, that any one of any right feeling can easily judge it, and his ignorance too, and the second is decidedly heretical on the Newton doctrine, but little the clergy care about this; but in such cases it is always the best way to leave it all to God: "Thou shalt answer for me, O Lord, my God.<a name=372:16></a>" As to -- , as I once said to another in a different case, you get as dirty in contending with a sweep as in hugging him.<a name=372:17></a> But our part is to live above these things, and to think not of attacks but of souls.<a name=372:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The opposition arises from the progress of truth, and from the consciousness they have that all their affair is hollow and crumbling.<a name=372:19></a> In England, the judgment of the Privy Council, deciding that the clergy is not bound to hold the scriptures to be inspired, has thrown dismay into their ranks, the rather as it overthrows the episcopal judgment.<a name=372:20></a> There is a commission to change the terms of subscription.<a name=372:21></a> In France, the result of a question in the Bible Society is the public proposal to make two churches of the national body.<a name=372:22></a> Those who would [have] a confession left before: one who is infidel and excluded is founding another on his own basis.<a name=372:23></a> Popery, of course, profits by this, yet those same men pretend they alone can meet it.<a name=372:24></a> Positivism, that is, that we can believe nothing but what comes under sensible experience of man's powers, is rampant; the most absurd and lowest of all forms of infidelity.<a name=372:25></a> I asked one the other day if he could tell me if I had a soul?<a name=372:26></a> No.<a name=372:27></a> That I had not one?<a name=372:28></a> No.<a name=372:29></a> That there was an eternity?<a name=372:30></a> No.<a name=372:31></a> That there was not?<a name=372:32></a> No: he might probably perish like a leaf.<a name=372:33></a> I asked the pupil if it was not leading to absolute ignorance: it was admitted.<a name=372:34></a> Another told me he did not know what conscience was; perhaps intelligence and habits mixed, heart and affection, warmer blood.<a name=372:35></a> You may conceive the degradation of all this.<a name=372:36></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not to alarm I say all this: the Lord is as faithful as ever, and the work of God is as evident as the power of evil; but it does not influence the world where it is not real.<a name=372:37></a> The path of the saint is simpler, only he must be decided to be anything.<a name=372:38></a> Those who do not believe in the Lord's coming say the church is going through a crisis, and will come out brighter: those who do, but are not faithful, are mournful, and embittered against those who see what is going on.<a name=372:39></a> We have only to pursue our way, doing good, and I find the doors more open than ever.<a name=372:40></a> My journey to America has done me good.<a name=372:41></a> I am, I trust, more loose to the world than ever, and feel I belong only to another world, and I bless God for it.<a name=372:42></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is one characteristic of the time in many who are getting loose from evil systems, the wish to belong to nothing.<a name=372:43></a> It is really want of faith to be decided in what is right, but it takes the form or pretext of liberty and love.<a name=372:44></a> Now I delight in spiritual liberty for myself and others: I could not give it up; I would not ask another to do so; but looseness of intention is not liberty, nor carelessness of conscience.<a name=372:45></a> I dread narrowness, but the wish to be free from divine restraint and walk carelessly, even as regards the church, or really as regards the world, is not liberty, it is a cloak of looseness of conscience, of insubjection to Christ's authority.<a name=372:46></a> I have no pretension to impose my way of seeing things on any one; but there is a claim, a system of freedom from Christ's yoke which, I believe, is most hurtful to souls: I never asked a person to come among brethren in my life, nor ever would.<a name=372:47></a> It is a current system -- I believe fundamentally bad; I know many beloved ones in it.<a name=372:48></a> It is a snare to them: I wait to see them clear.<a name=372:49></a> There is less of it in Canada; much in England and Ireland.<a name=372:50></a> Monstrous effects sometimes arise, things worse than purgatory taught in their common meetings; sometimes in consequence only select speakers allowed; but protestations of the sweetest communion with those who taught them, and an avowal that no common basis of truth was to be looked for.<a name=372:51></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How blessed to be peacefully delivered from all these things, and yet have the heart open to every saint; for my own part I feel daily more -- and with Christ Himself -- the blessedness of the position in which He has set me.<a name=372:52></a> I have seen weakness enough in my carrying it out, but never in the thing itself.<a name=372:53></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards your difficulty as to the place left you, I think it is often a proof of the weakness of saints -- not their waiting to be edified by another, not always there; I see nothing but what is very comely in that -- but in not freely, though doing that, taking a simple part as the Lord leads them, in some part even if they do not speak.<a name=372:54></a> But it is very often a source of trouble to myself.<a name=372:55></a> In very country parts it is often useless to press them, as it distresses them, provided full open is left for the action of the Spirit of God.<a name=372:56></a> Where more exercised brethren are, all that is needed is to leave the fullest opportunity for their action, all through the service, and then act in simplicity, but I have been often troubled by it, for even in the act of giving thanks -- a service I delight in -- leaving it always to one is distressing.<a name=372:57></a> When we really seek the full action and liberty of the Spirit of God, the Lord will graciously order all.<a name=372:58></a> The drawing out others to activity according to God is a gift in itself.<a name=372:59></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards the work there is nothing very particular.<a name=372:60></a> In France there is considerable conversion, and some new labourers raised up; and, in general, occasion for thankfulness, though we might look for a great deal more spiritual power: still generally, there is progress, extension of the work, and conversion: in the Free Church excessive looseness of doctrine, both here and in Switzerland.<a name=372:61></a> There, though I went by reason of sorrow, in one place I never had such good meetings, and hope to return.<a name=372:62></a> In Germany the work prospers.<a name=372:63></a> In Holland it is stationary.<a name=372:64></a> In England and in Ireland, in general, considerable progress; but, I think, some want of knitting together, partly from its extended character.<a name=372:65></a> In London they are both increasing and there is very much to be thankful for.<a name=372:66></a> Nor do I, indeed, think of any particular sorrow save at one place in Ireland and one in England, which last, however, save for the souls concerned, I think, is rather the contrary.<a name=372:67></a> As to numbers, the increase is rapid enough, and I certainly think growth in seriousness and reference to the Lord increased.<a name=372:68></a> More strength of union is the chief lack, I think .<a name=372:69></a>.<a name=372:70></a>.<a name=372:71></a> .<a name=372:72></a> In all cases our path is simple, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing our labour is not in vain in the Lord; in due time we shall reap if we faint not -- much internal life and intercourse with the Lord, and then devotedness, but the first gives all its power to the latter.<a name=372:73></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The word is ever richer to me: I have been lately occupied with the difference of Ephesians 3 and 1.<a name=372:74></a> The latter puts the Christian in his position <i>before</i> God, the former fills us with Christ up to all the fulness of God, setting us in the fulness of that divine centre, in the apprehension there of the whole of that in which God glorifies Himself; in the intimacy withal of Christ's love.<a name=372:75></a> I have not yet thoroughly examined chapter 4 in its own place as following this.<a name=372:76></a> I see it is the fruit of the power and presence of the Holy Ghost in us.<a name=372:77></a> The prominency of infidelity and positivism has made me feel more than ever how the knowledge of God in Christ is a divine work and gift; how we owe all to sovereign grace.<a name=372:78></a> But as I get on I feel it is a more <i>natural</i> thing to belong to God: to be out of it an unnatural state.<a name=372:79></a> This has made me happy, and given a peaceful character to my spiritual feelings.<a name=372:80></a> Sovereign grace has put us, in the second Adam, in this relationship; but to be in relationship in peace is the only normal state.<a name=372:81></a> And that is peace; but then it makes one so much the more feel that the world is a wholly outside thing, a sorrowful scene of minds, souls actively in confusion.<a name=372:82></a> Yet even we have to be athirst for God; if we have seen Him in the sanctuary, not only we long for our Father's house, but love the ways there, though they pass through the vale of tears -- but athirst for God; and in this we are satisfied as with marrow and fatness, and praise while we live, because we have His favour which is <i>better</i> than life.<a name=372:83></a> The Lord keep us both patiently and fervently near Himself, drawing from that source of blessing and truth.<a name=372:84></a>
	</div>

		My heart still looks to a visit again to America.<a name=372:85></a> I am somewhat old to undertake the United States, but I do trust dear -- is raised up for blessing.<a name=372:86></a> I have been, however, happy in it, and that I surely have been almost surprised at the way I have got attached to Canada -- not, indeed, from what I met with there, for I met with every possible kindness, but when reflecting because of my age; but the Lord orders things after all, not man, nor even his time of life.<a name=372:87></a> I feel my spirit as thoroughly in the country as if I had been always of it, and more happily.<a name=372:88></a> However, our work is where the Lord sends us.<a name=372:89></a> Faith, I believe, brought me there, and so I was happy.<a name=372:90></a> The need is great here; still, I hope, if the Lord allow me, to see you all again.<a name=372:91></a> I know not where you may be.<a name=372:92></a> The Lord's grace and peace be with you, dear brother.<a name=372:93></a>

		[Brother Hill] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I have just received your letter in the south of France, in the midst of a conference, but am anxious to reply a few words.<a name=377:20></a> I have not Mr.<a name=377:21></a> S -- 's book, so that I cannot examine it closely; I looked it over when our brother -- sent it to me; I thought the passage he referred to to be regretted.<a name=377:22></a> Other things in the tract seemed to me to be almost of more importance, though not apparent.<a name=377:23></a> But I am a little jealous of making every mistake a matter of public discipline by a kind of judgment of a council; sometimes we give importance to what would have none.<a name=377:24></a> It is a different matter when evil teaching or doctrine is introduced into a meeting of which I am a part.<a name=377:25></a> My impression was that the tract would have died a natural death.<a name=377:26></a> I make a difference between a person not rightly dividing the word of truth, and positively teaching on the part of the enemy what dishonours the Person of Christ, or saps any fundamental truth.<a name=377:27></a> Few are capable of not overstepping the bounds of sound doctrine, even in opposing positive error.<a name=377:28></a> Our beloved brother exposed himself to attacks by expressions.<a name=377:29></a> He was sound in his positive truth, but in attacking error wrote so as to commit himself, and the enemy, of course profited by it.<a name=377:30></a> I never for a moment would give him up, though the first to warn him, because I was satisfied he was sound in doctrine, though he had stumbled into regrettable mistakes.<a name=377:31></a> I declared, did he hold what he was accused of, I could not for a moment be in communion with him; but he did not .<a name=377:32></a>.<a name=377:33></a>.<a name=377:34></a> This is for me the question with -- .<a name=377:35></a> I am perfectly satisfied he is wrong in his views -- his letter proves it, his tract I have not here (I will try and have it sent me).<a name=377:36></a> But I remember the time when the believing Christ to have been a priest upon earth was considered the test of orthodoxy against the Socinians .<a name=377:37></a>.<a name=377:38></a>.<a name=377:39></a> .<a name=377:40></a>

		If it was answered that bearing sin imparted defilement, the words would have to be explained, or it would be slippery ground.<a name=377:41></a> I do not believe that "this he did once" (Hebrews 7: 27) refers to His offering for sins in any sense for Himself.<a name=377:42></a> But if a person took it only in the sense of representation for His people, I think it a mistake, but there is no thought of his dishonouring Christ.<a name=377:43></a> I should examine the book before I said anything more.<a name=377:44></a> It seemed, as I read it, a book of very particular opinions and views, where there was confidence in a man's own thoughts.<a name=377:45></a> I dread this, it always leads to notions and errors.<a name=377:46></a> I should dread and examine very closely the notion of Christ's ear, etc.<a name=377:47></a>, being touched with blood.<a name=377:48></a> If it was meant merely that the perfectness of the obedience marked by His death was realised in every act of His life, I might not agree -- fear such tendencies -- but no harm might be meant.<a name=377:49></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not think Christ was a priest on earth, save as representing Aaron on the great day of atonement on the cross -- and I suspect this infects all his views.<a name=377:50></a> Aaron was anointed with oil, without blood, alone first.<a name=377:51></a> But error in interpretation is another thing from deliberately teaching a system dishonouring to Christ, and I dread <i>excessively</i> for brethren the dissecting of doctrine relative to Christ and His offering.<a name=377:52></a> The great traits are vital; pretending to accuracy destroys reverence and leads to infidelity.<a name=377:53></a> Mr.<a name=377:54></a> -- , I fear, through confidence in his own studies, has run into this; the worst of consequences would be the brethren following him into it, even to oppose him .<a name=377:55></a>.<a name=377:56></a>.<a name=377:57></a> .<a name=377:58></a> What I dread is any number of brethren committing all to what many may be incapable of entering into.<a name=377:59></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have found the tract and read it through; absorbed by one subject, it abounds, in my judgment, in blunders.<a name=377:60></a> That brethren have repudiated it for themselves is all very well; I repudiate the statement myself; and his letter adds to the confusion.<a name=377:61></a> But I still think it calls for no public action.<a name=377:62></a> When needed, the blunders may be shewn.<a name=377:63></a> But that is better for all than a fuss about it.<a name=377:64></a> He makes priesthood depend on union, which is a mistake.<a name=377:65></a> He confounds worship with priesthood, or rather, effaces worship by it -- a very serious mistake.<a name=377:66></a> He talks of the Father hiding His face, which is a mischievous confusion; but all this is ignorance on points to which his attention probably has not been called.<a name=377:67></a> You will be surprised, perhaps, when I say that the whole is, to me, ignorance of self and unsuspected self-righteousness.<a name=377:68></a> He little thinks so, if I am, indeed, right.<a name=377:69></a> He has meddled with what was beyond his measure; but I doubt he meant to dishonour Christ, and, though I reject the interpretation in the matter accused, I do not apprehend he meant otherwise than that Christ offered for Himself once, and as bearing our sins and identified with us; I do not think this scriptural .<a name=377:70></a>.<a name=377:71></a>.<a name=377:72></a> .<a name=377:73></a> This is connected with the grave mistake of making Christ a priest, with blood, during His life.<a name=377:74></a> The <i>for ever</i> in his letter is a curious blunder.<a name=377:75></a> But then I make a total difference between the blunders of a man and a work of Satan undermining Christ in Himself .<a name=377:76></a>.<a name=377:77></a>.<a name=377:78></a> .<a name=377:79></a> He thought he saw far into the matter, and it is evident to me that he is mistaken.<a name=377:80></a>

		Dearest R Evans, -- I was just thinking of writing to you, without any particular motive but that it was so long since I had, when I got your letter upon my arrival here in Zrich.<a name=380:1></a> As regards the text, Hebrews 9: 12, it has occupied all interpreters, and my own mind, in reading scripture.<a name=380:2></a> The whole matter is that S -- has trusted the English, or overlooked the commonest possible use of diavverses "This is he that came by [ diavvv ] water and blood.<a name=380:3></a>" Whatever characterises, or is as circumstances surrounding, is expressed by diavvv; so Romans 2: 27, where the sense is unmistakable.<a name=380:4></a> So chapter 4: 11, pisteuovntwn di j ajkrobustiva"; so chapter 14: 20, dia; proskovmmato" ejsqivonti; 2 Corinthians 2: 4, dia; pollw'n dakruvwn; so that genevsqai diav is used in the classics for the active verb.<a name=380:5></a> Romans 8: 25, di j uJpomonh'" ajpekdecovmeqa; Hebrews 12: 1, di jj uJpomonh'" trevcwmen .<a name=380:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Further, it was not <i>in virtue</i> of the blood of bulls and goats that the high priest entered in; indeed, what was to hinder his dying himself was the cloud of incense.<a name=380:7></a> If it had been alleged that the bullock was for the church and the goat for Israel (not that I should pronounce this), my mind would have been otiose in hearing it; but when he says "both" in that sacrifice, he makes Christ distinct from the sacrifice.<a name=380:8></a> In the consecration, Aaron is sanctified alone, without blood, and then his sons with him, with blood, and their garments with him (not "them"), because without him they had no reality of existence.<a name=380:9></a> But that on which -- rests all his system is wholly without foundation; it is a mistake as to the use of diav.<a name=380:10></a> When it is said that God brought Him from the dead, it is ejk, not diav.<a name=380:11></a> (Hebrews 13: 20.<a name=380:12></a>) The whole fabric of doctrine is therefore contradicted by an intelligent apprehension of the text of scripture.<a name=380:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The appeal to Psalm 110 is extraordinary; not only the whole psalm is based on setting Christ at God's right hand, but the whole reasoning of the apostle on it in Hebrews 6, 7; and, indeed, the gist of the whole Epistle is to prove that it is in heaven and not on earth.<a name=380:14></a> "Such an high priest became us," who is "made higher than the heavens" in "the power of an endless life.<a name=380:15></a>" He is consecrated eij" to;n aijw'na, and He must be a man to be so.<a name=380:16></a> (See chapter 6: 20.<a name=380:17></a>) Had He even entered into the holy place during His life as priest He would have done so without blood; but He entered in ejfavpax, "once for all, having obtained eternal redemption for us.<a name=380:18></a>" The whole of this doctrine, therefore, is unfounded.<a name=380:19></a> I dread pursuing figures with an unsanctified spirit; they are most instructive when we have solid truth as the base, but the <i>mind</i> may run into all ideas by them.<a name=380:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The word "associates Himself" with sinners is <i>in itself</i> too vague to rest upon; where it comes in the pamphlet it is a contradiction; either it is substitution -- and then it is not "both" -- or Christ is distinct and presents Himself distinct as a sinner.<a name=380:21></a> I do not know what <i>identity</i> with each other means: is it substitution, or is Christ for Himself apart, as other sinners (each for himself) are, though united in the need of the sacrifice?<a name=380:22></a> Where was the need of Christ's offering for <i>Himself</i>?<a name=380:23></a> Was it the sin of others?<a name=380:24></a> Then it is substitution, or taking their place -- or some entrance of His own into the place of guilt, not <i>for</i> others, but <i>with</i> -- so that the sacrifice for Him, since He was sinless, was an untruth.<a name=380:25></a> I find much that is vague and uncertain.<a name=380:26></a> In the burnt-offering (page 15) the animal's blood was shed, and shed for atonement.<a name=380:27></a> Again, "here, too, the Lord Jesus associates His people with Himself" -- how "too"?<a name=380:28></a> His being associated with sinners as such is not associating His people with Himself; it is the opposite.<a name=380:29></a> All this is very unsolid ground, but hardly needs to be taken up and made a crime of.<a name=380:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I find on page 17 the same uncertain sound, but on a more serious point.<a name=380:31></a> "The same sacrifice serves for all, and brings them near to the same God, in the same place of acceptance.<a name=380:32></a>" Now, that Christ is, as man, in the presence and favour of God, after being abandoned <i>for others</i>, is blessedly true; but if the same sacrifice serves for all, that is, Christ and His people, and brings them near, it makes Him afar off <i>Himself</i>, and needing to be brought near; all this is worse than loose.<a name=380:33></a> So, that the incense is the prayers of the saints I judge not sustainable, where Christ offers it: in Revelation 5 we find the thought, but not with Christ the offerer.<a name=380:34></a> I do not know what "we as priests, may sprinkle the blood" means, that is, I do not believe it has any true sense, or that -- could give it any.<a name=380:35></a> But I do not doubt that many a poor saint enjoys the urging to priestly character in truth, and slips over the evil without noticing anything particular; only there is danger of imbibing with it.<a name=380:36></a> But they are bee-like; suck the honey from every flower.<a name=380:37></a> He has committed himself, by self-confidence, to a series of blunders, founded on ignorance of the use of diavv, or inattention to it.<a name=380:38></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The talking of Christ's identifying Himself with Himself (for He is the victim), as if He was so associated with sinners that a victim was necessary for Him, and yet He was the victim for Himself as sinless enough to be so, is utter confusion.<a name=380:39></a> This is the theory of page 15.<a name=380:40></a> It may seem very profound, but it is far away from the simplicity of scripture.<a name=380:41></a> That He was made sin for us we believe; but was He made sin for Himself?<a name=380:42></a> (unless He be taken simply as the representative, or substitute of His people, which, though it may be held innocently, is itself rather forcing expressions) .<a name=380:43></a>.<a name=380:44></a>.<a name=380:45></a> .<a name=380:46></a> That Christ was a priest down here, I reject as fundamentally false, save as He, as High Priest, represented the people on the great day of atonement.<a name=380:47></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards the Notes on Leviticus, they were made by Miss T.<a name=380:48></a> from lectures at Plymouth, and though I do not doubt the substance in them, I must decline wholly being responsible for the expressions: even when one looks over such, if attention be not drawn to them, particular expressions are overlooked.<a name=380:49></a> Nor would I, when the purport is scriptural, make a man an offender for a word.<a name=380:50></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The part that pressed our own acting as priests in close union with Christ, is the part that has probably attracted pious persons who have not noticed the evil part, taking for granted that it was what is generally held.<a name=380:51></a> You have no idea how few are theologians, even in their faith.<a name=380:52></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I was very glad indeed to hear of the general blessing from God's gracious goodness.<a name=380:53></a> We have had a meeting in Guernsey, common to French and English, and the Lord's approbation and blessing was very sensibly felt.<a name=380:54></a> Of England I know nothing very recent; I think the brethren have an increased feeling that they must be devoted, and expectation of the coming of the Lord.<a name=380:55></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In France we cannot complain.<a name=380:56></a> There is a new and interesting field in the Charente, and in the Ardche a good many conversions; in some places a want of energy, but in general the work maintains its ground and progresses; here and there one would be glad to see more energy in the work, though this does not apply to all, and God has raised up some new labourers.<a name=380:57></a> I sent dear -- some account I think of what has been going on in France; outside brethren, much evil, but a reaction of a very distinct character.<a name=380:58></a> The Lord willing, I purpose leaving in October for Canada, I suppose by Halifax and Boston.<a name=380:59></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The letter of -- to G.<a name=380:60></a> distinctly affirms the point in which he is wrong, and I have no hesitation in saying is founded on bad Greek.<a name=380:61></a> The English may be pleaded, but I am satisfied the translators never entered into the doctrine.<a name=380:62></a> The notion of Christ's being a priest for ever, as he states it, is I think the most absurd idea I ever heard of; contradicting the whole doctrine of scripture and of Hebrews on the subject.<a name=380:63></a> He could not genhqh'nai ajrciereva [chapter 5: 5], was a priest without being a man without anybody to be priest for even, without blood; there is no end to the contradictions; He could not be consecrated, it was only when He was teleiwqeiv" that He was saluted of God according to Psalm 110.<a name=380:64></a> (See Hebrews 5: 6.<a name=380:65></a>) The insisting on the word "art" is inconceivable; it is in italics even in the English Bible, Old [Psalm 110: 4] and New Testament, while in the new it is applied to the time of His being perfected, after His crying and tears.<a name=380:66></a> It is to be remembered that contrast is more found in Hebrews than comparison.<a name=380:67></a> But I close this; it is not my object to make a treatise, but you will understand why I thought that with explanation when needed it might have died <i>de sa belle mort</i> .<a name=380:68></a>.<a name=380:69></a>.<a name=380:70></a> .<a name=380:71></a>

		Dearest J G Bellett, -- I was for some days back, waiting the moment to write to you (moving about from meeting to meeting in the Jura), moved by the same motive which brought me yours, for which I heartily thank you, and am so far glad that mine was delayed, as I had yours without even one from me.<a name=383:1></a> If your strength be spared a little, I hope to see you.<a name=383:2></a> I purpose on my way to Canada, instead of sailing from Liverpool, to go and see you in Dublin, and get on board at Cork.<a name=383:3></a> I trust the Lord may so order it, but His way I am sure is best.<a name=383:4></a> Oh, how truly I feel that!<a name=383:5></a> You can hardly think how I feel that, and myself a stranger here.<a name=383:6></a> I have ever found in you, dear brother, everything that was kind; nor be assured was it lost upon me, though I am not demonstrative.<a name=383:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Besides the value I had for you, it was not a small thing to me that you, with dear C.<a name=383:8></a> and H.<a name=383:9></a>, were one of the first four, who with me, through God's grace the fourth, began to break bread in Dublin, what I believe was God's own work: much weakness I own in carrying it out, little faith to make good the power which was and is in the testimony, but God's own testimony I am assured -- in every respect, even as to the gospel to sinners, what He was doing.<a name=383:10></a> I knew, for one, in no wise, the bearing and importance of what I was about, though I felt in lowliness we were doing God's work.<a name=383:11></a> The more I go on, the more I have seen of the world, the more of Christians, the more I am assured that it was God using us for His testimony at this time.<a name=383:12></a> I never felt it as I do; but it is not my purpose to dwell on it now, and I fully own our weakness.<a name=383:13></a> It is to you dear brother, my heart turns now, to say how much I own and value your love, and to return it; I rejoice that while I have been the object of many kindnesses on your part down here, it is one which will never cease, which has had Jesus our Master for its bond, though with many human kindnesses.<a name=383:14></a> But oh, what joy to know oneself united to Him!<a name=383:15></a> It adds a joy untold to every sweetness: it is the source of it too.<a name=383:16></a> Surely He is all.<a name=383:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		For me, I work on till He call me, and though it would be a strange Dublin without you, yet I go on my way, serve others, say little and pass on.<a name=383:18></a> Not that I do not deeply love others, but this will all come out in its truth in heaven, perhaps on one's death-bed; but I have committed my all to Him till that day.<a name=383:19></a> My hope is still to see you, my beloved brother; should I not, be assured there is none who has loved you more truly and thankfully than myself; it can hardly be unknown to you, though with me it is more within than without.<a name=383:20></a> Peace be with you.<a name=383:21></a> May you find the blessed One ever near you; that is everything.<a name=383:22></a> Faithful is He withal and true.<a name=383:23></a> In His eternal presence, how shall we feel that all our little sorrows and separations were but little drops by the way, to make us feel that we were not with Him, and when with Him, what it is to be there.<a name=383:24></a> Oh, how well ordered all is!<a name=383:25></a> I ever long more to be in heaven with Him before the Father, though I desire to finish whatever He has for me to do; and if it keeps me awhile out, it keeps me out for Him, and then it is worth while, and grace .<a name=383:26></a>.<a name=383:27></a>.<a name=383:28></a> .<a name=383:29></a>

		-- - Our present path is a very simple one.<a name=385:1></a> There may be all sorts of evil here and there, and even God's people are so mixed up with it, that we may not be able to say who are His and who are not.<a name=385:2></a> "Nevertheless, the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his.<a name=385:3></a>" But we have also a word to act upon the conscience: "Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.<a name=385:4></a>" If you say, I know what I am in is unscriptural, and I am constantly involved in what is wrong, but I see nothing better; I answer that you must not go on with that: "depart from iniquity.<a name=385:5></a>" We are told to purge ourselves from vessels to dishonour -- that he who does, "shall be a vessel unto honour," sanctified and meet for the Master's use, and prepared unto every good work.<a name=385:6></a> Then, it may be urged, you will have to go alone, or lead in some new thing.<a name=385:7></a> But not so; I have to "follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace <i>with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart</i>.<a name=385:8></a>" In these days, however, a great deal of <i>patience</i> also may be needed, as, indeed, Paul proceeds to remind Timothy in his day.<a name=385:9></a> Jeremiah was indignant at the state of things he saw around him; but he received the word, "If thou shall take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth.<a name=385:10></a>" (Chapter 15.<a name=385:11></a>) So, at present, one might be provoked to abstain from having anything to do with persons in the sects, etc.<a name=385:12></a>; but we have to remember that there are true saints of God in these associations, whose good we are to seek for the Lord's sake, and deliverance from all that is offensive to Him.<a name=385:13></a> If it be argued that, in this case, we ought to go with them, the answer is, "Let them return unto thee; but return not thou unto them.<a name=385:14></a>"<br>1864.<a name=385:15></a>

		[F G Patterson] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- As regards Acts 1: 18, 19, and Matthew 27: 3, etc.<a name=386:1></a>; I take Acts 1: 18-19 for a parenthesis of Luke's.<a name=386:2></a> The passages have been much discussed.<a name=386:3></a> The field was looked at as Judas' field, being purchased with his money, as some even say, he having bargained for it, the priests completed it and appropriated it to this purpose: he got a field as the reward of his iniquity, his money being employed for this.<a name=386:4></a> We have not details enough to connect the two accounts of his death.<a name=386:5></a> Some think, being hung he fell down, and thus the catastrophe took place.<a name=386:6></a> But I do not reject your thought of the association of Judas and the priests.<a name=386:7></a> The account in Acts supposes he went and fell headlong at first -- at once -- so that the passage does not imply that he got regular possession by contract himself.<a name=386:8></a> It is very possible that "purchased" is too definite; he got a field -- with Matthew 27 -- is bought, purchased.<a name=386:9></a> It was probably some poor waste ground, and Judas having thus gone and hung himself there, they bought it formally and appropriated it to this use.<a name=386:10></a> It is supposed he fell down on his face when he hung himself.<a name=386:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not take yuchv (Acts 2: 31) in any other sense but soul.<a name=386:12></a> His soul was in hades, His body in the grave: but I do not see how it separates His soul from His Person; the divine nature has nothing to do with place.<a name=386:13></a> His soul was separated from His body, but both held by divine power, so to speak, for His resurrection and glory.<a name=386:14></a> I do not think leaving out hJ yuch; aujtou' makes much difference, as it is in the psalm and quoted before.<a name=386:15></a> But I see no difficulty in the statement, for His soul was in paradise, His body in the grave; adou is merely the invisible place of departed spirits without more.<a name=386:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are many statements as to facts we cannot explain because we have not the connecting link -- as supposing the field was on a rock, an easy thing at Jerusalem, and he fell from the hanging place down it.<a name=386:17></a> I have no particular notion it was so, I use it as an illustration.<a name=386:18></a> If we knew such a fact, the statement is very plain.<a name=386:19></a> In doctrines many things are difficulties, because beyond sight we know so little.<a name=386:20></a>

		MY DEAR BROTHER, -- Though I am glad of every jealousy as to Christ and His work, yet we approach the subject altogether from a different point of view.<a name=387:19></a> You say we should be no losers if they were confined to the cross, because it would suffice to their comfort and help: I wholly reject this view of the matter.<a name=387:20></a> My soul rests, I trust, simply on the cross, but I think I am an immense loser if I lose anything of those sorrows and ways of love in which my Master went in grace.<a name=387:21></a> I understand the difficulty printing gives, as it presents points to all for which all are not prepared; hence I am not anxious to prove or explain.<a name=387:22></a> People will see clearer as they get on; and if they have the essentials, if they lose much, at least they are safe.<a name=387:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You say if the awful hour of the cross sufficed to deliver Jew and Gentile from an eternity of misery, surely it would to supply to their comfort and help while here all such experiences.<a name=387:24></a> This is every way false, and to me only shews a soul -- forgive my plainness -- not peacefully settled on the cross.<a name=387:25></a> Our experience and the cross are two distinct things.<a name=387:26></a> Atonement gets out of the reach of experience: it only connects itself with <i>experience</i> when its value is not fully known as such.<a name=387:27></a> But it further shews, as is consequently quite natural, that you have not before you in the smallest degree the question at issue.<a name=387:28></a> The remnant of the Jews will not have the knowledge of that deliverance until they look on Him whom they have pierced, and hence want all that accompanied it as sorrow and distress before deliverance to sustain and hold up their souls; and this is the constant current of thought in the Psalms.<a name=387:29></a> "This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him," and the like, in a multitude of passages.<a name=387:30></a> Besides your principle would make the sorrows of Christ, as suffering being tempted, entirely useless (we should lose nothing) even for us.<a name=387:31></a> They are not the cross.<a name=387:32></a> I will not enter into your own arrangement of the psalm, and the difficulties you have created to yourself by it, but meet the main points on which your mind rests as to my statements.<a name=387:33></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The New Testament is most distinct in its evidence that there was something besides anticipation; though anticipation of what closed these sufferings aggravated the passage towards what so closed it.<a name=387:34></a> I really cannot understand the state of several minds here except by a growing conviction that they have <i>no real sense</i> of what atonement is.<a name=387:35></a> Take the simplest things: was it no suffering to be deserted, betrayed, denied by those dear to Him, to look for compassion and find none?<a name=387:36></a> Was it no suffering which made Him weep over beloved Jerusalem?<a name=387:37></a> no suffering to give up all He was so deeply attached to in the earthly elect people of God, and His Messiahship as then to be made good?<a name=387:38></a> Did Paul not suffer when he had wished himself accursed for his brethren according to the flesh, whose were the promises, the law, the covenants, and Christ according to the flesh?<a name=387:39></a> Did he feel this deeply, and Christ Himself not?<a name=387:40></a> Was it not indignation of God against Israel?<a name=387:41></a> It is the technical term in Psalms and prophets for it.<a name=387:42></a> You may see the use of the word as to Egypt in Psalm 78: 49; for its use as to Israel see Isaiah 10: 5, 25; 26: 20; 30: 27 applies to the nations, but Israel will be in it: Jeremiah 15: 17 where it is exactly the Spirit of Christ entering into what was on the Jews; so Lamentations 2: 6, etc.<a name=387:43></a>, Daniel 11: 36, where we have the whole scene of the latter days.<a name=387:44></a> The application of indignation and wrath to Israel in government is the just and clear expression of the word of God.<a name=387:45></a> (Read Lamentations 1, 2.<a name=387:46></a>) Do you think, or do you not think, that the Spirit of Christ entered into all this Himself, or was it merely Jeremiah's feelings?<a name=387:47></a> Or did He sorrow over sufferings in Zedekiah's time, and not enter the least into the far more terrible ones depicted in Daniel and Matthew 25, where it is said as a principle, "In all their afflictions he was afflicted"?<a name=387:48></a> Read in Micah 7 and stop at verse 9: has Christ in Spirit had no part in that?<a name=387:49></a> Yet in all this there is not atonement, no shedding of blood, no expiation.<a name=387:50></a> Those animated with the Spirit of Christ entered in their measure into them, as Jeremiah and Micah, and indeed others shew; but they had nothing to do with expiation.<a name=387:51></a> I really see nothing but ignorance, and, alas!<a name=387:52></a> often ignorance of what expiation is, as the objections made to what I have said.<a name=387:53></a> That such are safe I freely admit; pious even in the confusion they make between sorrow and expiation, I freely admit too; but that they lose nothing I cannot.<a name=387:54></a> They lose immensely, and lose what I have no thought, with God's help, of losing with them.<a name=387:55></a> The only detail that remains is the period at which Christ specially entered into this.<a name=387:56></a> I may tell you that some of my adversaries find the great sin of all exactly in what you insist as good and necessary.<a name=387:57></a> On the cross they declare there was expiation and no other suffering: elsewhere it may be.<a name=387:58></a> But I do say, because scripture is express and emphatic on the point, that there was a change in the position of the Lord previous to the cross; provided that it be distinguished from expiation, and that it were not by birth, but by grace when here as a Man, the moment is, <i>comparatively speaking</i>, indifferent, and to be learned simply from scripture.<a name=387:59></a> He began specifically to announce it to His disciples on His last journey from Galilee to Jerusalem.<a name=387:60></a> John declares several times that nobody touched Him, or the like, for His hour was not yet come.<a name=387:61></a> That hour is thus distinctly marked in scripture as in contrast with His ordinary ministry.<a name=387:62></a> At the last supper He refuses to drink with His disciples as He usually did.<a name=387:63></a> In Luke 22: 35-36, referring to their mission in Israel, in which He cared for them as Jehovah Messiah, He marks the difference as "when" and "now.<a name=387:64></a>" The same difference is marked in the most emphatic way in verse 53.<a name=387:65></a> If <i>that</i> was their hour and the power of darkness, the previous ones were <i>not</i>; nor, though they led the way to it, and Christ in that hour turned to His Father's will in it in His perfect piety, is their hour and the power of darkness expiation.<a name=387:66></a> It may result in that hour, in His being forsaken of His God on His appeal from that power to God; but the evil power of darkness and the forsaking are not the same (woe be to him who thinks it so), though they may go together, and one precede the other, and He appeals from the sorrows of one to God against it, and then finds Himself forsaken as no one else who trusted Him ever was.<a name=387:67></a> Further, the Lord states, "My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death.<a name=387:68></a> Tarry ye here and watch with me.<a name=387:69></a>" Here was real sorrow, suffering (and not mere anticipation), for it was the present power of death upon His soul, and the power of darkness; yet it is clear He was not drinking the cup, for He prays He may not.<a name=387:70></a>

		Your statement as to page 26<a href="#387:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> is as incorrect as it can well be.<a name=387:71></a> I find nothing in page 26 of Christ <i>having the exercises</i> of a soul awakened, etc.<a name=387:72></a> What I find there is this: Christ has passed through all these kinds of sufferings, only the last, of course, as a perfect being to learn it for others: I need not say He was perfect in all.<a name=387:73></a> Now allow me to say that having the exercises of a soul -- your words are as charging me, Christ "had the exercises .<a name=387:74></a>.<a name=387:75></a>.<a name=387:76></a> learning <i>when a sinner</i>," etc.<a name=387:77></a>; my statement is, Man may be looked at, etc.<a name=387:78></a>, as in this state, and then that Christ passed through the suffering as learning it for others: now allow me to say, when people take on themselves to accuse they should be exact.<a name=387:79></a> I am perfectly sure that it was the impression of your mind, but this I am satisfied flows from not entering into what expiation is, and what Christ suffered.<a name=387:80></a> I acquit you wholly of any wrong intention in it, be it so, say that, and I have no more to say.<a name=387:81></a> But it is different when we make a charge of what we do not understand.<a name=387:82></a> I believe Christ did enter into all the exercises of a soul in this state, and in particular of Israel, to whose state in the latter days the condition of souls under the law is very analogous.<a name=387:83></a> They have God's judgment of sin before their eyes; so had Christ then, but He was not under it as drinking the cup.<a name=387:84></a> They are awakened, quickened, upright in desire, yet not delivered: Christ had the life by which they are quickened, and felt all that one perfectly upright could feel; and what He was in Himself they will receive, as nature and desire, through Him.<a name=387:85></a> Christ was in the deepest way learning -- Himself perfectly good -- all that evil was experimentally, as the hatred of man against Him.<a name=387:86></a> The reproaches of them that reproached God fell on Him; and here this was come up to a crisis without restraint, and according to the power of Satan in it.<a name=387:87></a> No christian man can deny it.<a name=387:88></a> He had hatred for His love, and here it came out unrestrained, and all Satan's power in it; yet He was not yet drinking the cup of God's wrath, though this hatred of course went on in its effects to the time He did.<a name=387:89></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is expressly stated in my tract that He passed through it as a perfect being, learning it for others.<a name=387:90></a> I pity with my whole soul those who do not see it; who, being ignorant of the true power of expiation in the drinking of the cup on the cross, do not see the reality of His suffering in Gethsemane, including anticipation, which is distinctly referred to in the passage; and who deny the power of Satan as pressing on Him, which He distinctly declares ("The prince of this world cometh"); and man's hour as the enemy of God; or suppose that Christ felt nothing about it.<a name=387:91></a> Was the full power of Satan let loose upon Him when He said, "This is your hour, and the power of darkness," which was before the cross, though in its effect continued up to it?<a name=387:92></a> Israel will not learn the knowledge of God's favour resting upon them, and hence dread rejection and condemnation.<a name=387:93></a> This Christ went through as suffering far more deeply than ever they will, because He was distinctly anticipating the cup He had to drink, which they were in their measure dreading, but never will.<a name=387:94></a> You repeat, Christ's having the exercises of a soul <i>when a sinner</i>!<a name=387:95></a> which is your own imagination, not what I have said.<a name=387:96></a> But I think you wholly and deplorably wrong when you say, "What could intensify their sufferings equally with a knowledge of God's favour resting on them?<a name=387:97></a>" They are beset by enemies, treachery, betrayal, all recognised as deep sufferings of Christ.<a name=387:98></a> There is the subtlety and besetting of Antichrist, the deep dark power of Satan pressing upon them, using withal the fear of judgment, or the cup of God's wrath to press upon their soul and turn them aside.<a name=387:99></a> It is not a question of "equally," but of the pressure on them running up into the wrath they dread; and this Christ did go through -- as to Antichrist, what was equivalent -- before He drank the cup; but anticipating it He declares He did.<a name=387:100></a> It is used constantly in the Psalms to encourage the remnant of Israel, as distinct from the subsequent full knowledge of atonement.<a name=387:101></a> Satan departed from Him for a season: He came, therefore, back again.<a name=387:102></a> Was it not where it is said, "This is your hour and the power of darkness"?<a name=387:103></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have been interrupted, and could not finish the current of my thoughts, and I have answered all that is material; and I repeat my full and deep conviction, that where it is not malice, and sometimes when it is, the difficulties or objections arise from the soul not having true rest in divine righteousness, and a just (adequate we never can) estimate of atonement; and hence incapacity to look with adoring peace and interest on the sorrows of the blessed Lord as such.<a name=387:104></a> The cross itself, or rather what is called by such, atonement on it, is mixed up with our experiences and comfort in them, and immense loss is the result in both respects.<a name=387:105></a> This which I have gathered from many souls who had difficulties, and it has been a help to me as to the state of such, is entirely confirmed by your letter.<a name=387:106></a> I dare say passages might be made clearer in my tract; as a professed reprint I could not do that; but, as to the doctrine contained in it, all the attacks made have only convinced me that, while Christ's connection with the remnant may be beyond the habits of thought, which is not always in any way a blame, of many, the want of receiving the testimony of scripture, or ignorance of its statements, is the real and only ground of objections made; and the search into scripture it has occasioned to myself has only confirmed me in the truth of what is said, and the real character of the objections, itself a confirmation of the justness of my thoughts; while I admit, as I said, it may not be for all meat in due season, but what to do when it is printed at all.<a name=387:107></a>

		J B Stoney, I do not know what else we have to do down here but to know God better and to serve, but I look especially for devotedness in brethren now.<a name=394:14></a> I have no doubt their place is just the testimony of God, not from any wisdom of ours, but the sovereign goodness of God, and more or less knowledge; but the testimony is not filled up or made good if there be not the devotedness.<a name=394:15></a> I do not deem the doctrine unimportant.<a name=394:16></a> The more I go on, the more I see that the evangelical body has lost itself -- never has had, and resists the doctrine of Paul -- not merely the church, that has been long clear, but even as to our whole standing as Christians.<a name=394:17></a> I am daily more distinct, when occasion requires, in bearing testimony to it.<a name=394:18></a> Striving may be of no use, but I think clearness of testimony is, and no fear in giving it; the times are too serious, only one must know what one is about, what the real point is.<a name=394:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the controversy about righteousness, and so about law, has brought the matter out; are we in the first or second Adam?<a name=394:20></a> Save the most useful and searching Epistle of James, the writings of the New Testament do not treat of justification, save those of Paul.<a name=394:21></a> John takes up the principle involved in it, but not in that shape -- of course, confirms it as of one Spirit; but being risen with Christ, and so presented before God, is Pauline: only one has to watch that the divine character is fully developed, if we are occupied with this (I mean in one's own mind and faith), and that is fully done in Paul in his own way -- of course I mean in that channel of truth in which the Holy Ghost led him -- and wonderful it is how it is out of and above law; for these legalists are in their doctrine contemptible.<a name=394:22></a> We are to be imitators of God -- Christ being our pattern -- and shew divine life in our entire offering up of self, and that to God, that the principle may be perfect.<a name=394:23></a> I have been occupied with this lately, and am thinking of sending a paper to the "Girdle" on it.<a name=394:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think God has been somewhat helping brethren in their publications lately, which is mercy from His hands, but we have to fill up a vastly greater framework of testimony than we do.<a name=394:25></a> Workmen must have faith in all they have to do with.<a name=394:26></a> Often laments and inquiries as to the state of brethren are mainly the want of faith as to those who express them.<a name=394:27></a> Yet I fear the world for them -- sometimes rash statements, but that is a less evil -- but devotedness, and separateness from the world, nonconformity to it -- that is what I look for.<a name=394:28></a>

		Blessing has gone on here.<a name=394:29></a> There has been life enough to increase everywhere in numbers without any special gift, and healthful, comfortable additions.<a name=394:30></a> Our meeting (conference) at Toronto was a very happy one indeed.<a name=394:31></a> One, who I trust may be a workman, at any rate a witness, got his soul cleared on a multitude of subjects, once connected with Adventists, before a Methodist preacher: our communion as happy as possible, and scripture much opened and enjoyed.<a name=394:32></a> I am here arrived at Collingwood in a heavy snowdrift (if you can find the Georgian Bay, which makes a large part of Lake Huron, but all this part is now under ice), though it has not been particularly cold, but pretty early, and steady, once ten degrees below zero: but save snow, the cold is delicious weather, and not felt, unless when there is wind -- then it is no joke.<a name=394:33></a> A few meet here, but it is wild enough.<a name=394:34></a> Last summer enormous districts of forest took fire and were burnt down, and the deer this year easily taken; but I came in railroad carriages with stoves, in this country where endless forests, and the highest degree of civilization strangely meet together.<a name=394:35></a> But the Lord is the same everywhere -- and so is man morally!<a name=394:36></a>

		[Dr.<a name=396:1></a> C Wolston] VERY DEAR BROTHER, -- I am glad you are working, and glad to hear you are doctoring.<a name=396:2></a> It is well to labour thus if we can.<a name=396:3></a> W.<a name=396:4></a>'s pamphlet came by the same post as your letter.<a name=396:5></a> I do not see any sign of his being taught of God in it.<a name=396:6></a> I see many truths he has learned from brethren, and a quantity of mixed confused stuff he has added, and no real statement of his views, with many things quite wrong, the moment he leaves what he has learned from men.<a name=396:7></a> But it is well brethren should learn from it.<a name=396:8></a> If they have left their first love, they are called to humiliation and repentance.<a name=396:9></a> I feel nothing more important than singleness of eye and devotedness at this moment.<a name=396:10></a> It is the way of light, the way of joy of heart with Him who is the only source of true joy, and the source of eternal joy.<a name=396:11></a> Oh, may the brethren have fast hold of this!<a name=396:12></a> all they have learned is of no use without it -- yea, in their faith and for others, they will lose.<a name=396:13></a> That heart devotedness to Christ and obedience will only be thought of value in the past, when we come to meet Him.<a name=396:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards the want of moral tone in the gathering, we and you and they ought to lay it deeply to heart -- pray over it -- if we do with faith, we shall find the blessing; if two, a direct answer.<a name=396:15></a> But patience is called for in our dealings.<a name=396:16></a> The tone of the whole meeting has to be raised in these cases, to judge particular facts.<a name=396:17></a> Had we power, a letter would do it, like Paul's first to the Corinthians.<a name=396:18></a> That we have not always, but we have always the sure resource of the faithfulness of Christ the blessed Lord, who loves His own, and has purchased them at the price of His own blood, so that we can count upon His desire to bless them.<a name=396:19></a> But it is a trial of faith, because, meanwhile, the name of the Lord is dishonoured, and alas!<a name=396:20></a> often <i>felt</i> as the honour of the body dishonoured; but if remedy may be, we must go through this for His sake and the sake thus of His, and He will make good His own cause at the end: only surely it is loss and humbling meanwhile.<a name=396:21></a> The Lord arouse His saints by His power, that He may give them light.<a name=396:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here, on the whole, in detail we are blessed, though I cannot speak of power; the additions (and they are pretty numerous) are generally precious ones, and there are souls both converted and awakening: what is sometimes striking, and a wonderful grace of God, that if the purposes of heart are right, He will bless in conversion and gathering where there is not the most union, and thus keep up the health of a gathering.<a name=396:23></a> I do not say we ought to be satisfied, but He does so.<a name=396:24></a> I have been up the country and in the hush -- pretty cold, 26 degrees below zero; but found mercy, and the Lord carrying on His work.<a name=396:25></a> It is spreading about more or less, and souls inquiring.<a name=396:26></a> In the States too, so far we can heartily bless God -- when should we not?<a name=396:27></a> only we wait for eternity to do it well.<a name=396:28></a> My kindest love to the brethren: may the gracious Lord sanctify them to Himself .<a name=396:29></a>.<a name=396:30></a>.<a name=396:31></a> .<a name=396:32></a> The good Lord keep you near Himself.<a name=396:33></a>

		Dearest W Kelly, -- I had forgotten your enterprise,<a href="#397:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> and am frightened when I see the extent of the publications.<a name=397:1></a> I should think some of the Notes would require some revising, but I have no objection to them if they are useful being printed as notes.<a name=397:2></a> Even the sermons contain things I should not accept; they were first published with a notice that I had not revised them.<a name=397:3></a> <i>Some</i> of the earlier publications would require a note or two, where clearer light was acquired, but had better not be altered.<a name=397:4></a> I ought to have somewhere a copy of my letter to the Archbishop.<a name=397:5></a> I forget it.<a name=397:6></a> But his course was ruinous -- really stopped the deliverance from popery of masses, perhaps of all in Ireland; they were leaving from seven to eight hundred a week.<a name=397:7></a> He required the oath of supremacy and abjuration: it stopped as by a shot.<a name=397:8></a>

		As to oJ nikw'n kai; oJ thrw'n (Revelation 2: 26), it is difficult to answer for grammar in the Apocalypse: but they have only to he viewed as separate in idea here, and this is, I apprehend, intended: oJ nikw'n is the general character in every church.<a name=397:9></a> Here, another special character is spoken of by itself as a distinct thing, though therein he may overcome.<a name=397:10></a> We have once nikw'n without oJ.<a name=397:11></a>

		[F G Patterson] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I have no doubt as to the two questions you put to me.<a name=398:1></a> Clearly persons ought not to separate from the Table while they own it to be the table of the Lord.<a name=398:2></a> The very statement proves itself, for so far as the act goes, I am separating myself from the unity of the body of Christ and from the Lord's table.<a name=398:3></a> Besides, it is the individual taking upon himself the whole judgment of the church of God.<a name=398:4></a> If a person says I do not own it as the Lord's table, the communion of the body of Christ, of course the relationship is <i>ipso facto</i> broken.<a name=398:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the second question: the theory is that the flesh is allowed to act in nothing, though the strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and the assembly ought to carefully maintain the truth.<a name=398:6></a> When it is mere imperfection of knowledge and ignorance, and the main purport is godly, there we have to forbear; but teaching contrary to the truth clearly ought not to be allowed.<a name=398:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord in mercy still blesses us.<a name=398:8></a> It is a trying time, I may say, for all temporally, and our poorer brethren are thrown out of employment in more than one place, not all, of course, but it scatters them.<a name=398:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the work, we want energetic workmen more than work to do.<a name=398:10></a> As to C.<a name=398:11></a>, the candlestick seems put out, or something very like it; if it be so, no human efforts will do, but it was never wholly begun, as far as I can see.<a name=398:12></a> But we can cast our care on the Lord; that is one comfort, and it is mine.<a name=398:13></a>

		MY DEAR BROTHER, -- My answer has been delayed through constant work and absence from the house for evening meetings, etc.<a name=403:1></a>, but I should gladly help you in this to the utmost of my power, for this doctrine is a deadly and demoralising heresy, or, rather, infidelity.<a name=403:2></a> I ever refuted it, but I never saw so much of it as latterly, at New York and Boston.<a name=403:3></a> It issues in denying responsibility and conscience, enfeebling in the most deadly way the sense of sin, the value consequently of the atonement, and ultimately the divinity of Christ.<a name=403:4></a> All do not go this length, and are unaware of it, but it has led thousands in America there.<a name=403:5></a> It is its just result.<a name=403:6></a> Some hold simple annihilation; others, though death is ceasing to exist, yet a resurrection for judgment, and then torment.<a name=403:7></a> The greatest part of their proofs are from the Old Testament; and the moment you know that the mass of their texts refer to temporal judgments on earth, all that part of the fabric comes down.<a name=403:8></a> Then they dodge to words in the New Testament: as if, for example, "destruction" means ceasing to exist.<a name=403:9></a> This is not true, as "Oh Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself, but in me is thy help.<a name=403:10></a>" In the original it is the same word where it is said, "the <i>lost</i> sheep of the house of Israel.<a name=403:11></a>" God can say, "I create and I destroy;" but otherwise it is used constantly for ruin in a general sense, as in the boat the disciples say, "Carest thou not that we perish?<a name=403:12></a>" They admit there can be no annihilation in nature, and do not like the word.<a name=403:13></a> Next, death never means ceasing to exist.<a name=403:14></a> Scripture speaks of casting the soul into hell after the body is killed; so, in the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, they subsist after death.<a name=403:15></a> They say that is a Jewish figure: I admit it; but it is a figure to shew how they subsist after death.<a name=403:16></a> Again, it is said in Luke 20, "For all live unto him" -- dead men, but always alive to God.<a name=403:17></a> Besides, if it be then ceasing to exist, there is nobody to raise for judgment.<a name=403:18></a> The second death even is casting into the lake of fire, where they are tormented; that is, it is not ceasing to exist.<a name=403:19></a> They say eternal life and eternal death does not mean eternal.<a name=403:20></a> This is not true; eternal life and eternal punishment are spoken of together, and it is the regular force of it in scripture -- "The things which are seen are temporal, and the things which are not seen are eternal.<a name=403:21></a>" Nothing can be plainer than that.<a name=403:22></a> So we have "the eternal God," "the eternal Spirit," "eternal redemption," "eternal inheritance," -- all contrasted with time.<a name=403:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What is morally dreadful in it is the weakening of the sense of sin and atonement.<a name=403:24></a> For if my sin only deserved death, Christ had only to bear this for me which hundreds have borne besides: sin becomes little and atonement nothing.<a name=403:25></a> Hence a vast number speak of what Christ <i>obtained</i> for us by His death, but drop the atonement for our sins as of no consequence.<a name=403:26></a> Again, if death means ceasing to exist (and this is the basis of all their statements), then Christ ceased to exist: this leads many on to deny His divinity (I do not say all, though it is far the greatest number in America).<a name=403:27></a> If they say, "No, He was a divine Person, He did not," still He was a true man, body and soul, and truly died; and death does not mean ceasing to exist.<a name=403:28></a> Further, this materialism as to the soul is entirely contrary to scripture.<a name=403:29></a> In Genesis the way man is created is carefully distinguished from beasts.<a name=403:30></a> God breathed into his nostrils the breath of life: this He never did to the beasts.<a name=403:31></a> Hence Adam is called the son of God, and Paul declares we are the offspring of God.<a name=403:32></a> Hence to liken our soul to the beasts is false; besides what I quoted from the Gospels as to its subsistence after death.<a name=403:33></a> The one text, "It is appointed unto men once to die and <i>after</i> that the judgment," proves demonstratively that we subsist after death.<a name=403:34></a> Death dissolves our present state of existence, but that existence does not cease at all.<a name=403:35></a> So far from death being the full wages of sin in this sense, it is after death we get all we are adjudged to.<a name=403:36></a> That is, death as to the body is the result of sin here; the judgment of the man, to receive the real consequences of it before God, comes altogether after it.<a name=403:37></a> Hence there is a resurrection of the unjust, a resurrection to judgment.<a name=403:38></a> Remember, we conceive of eternity as prolonged time; that is, we do not conceive it at all.<a name=403:39></a> It is an eternal Now.<a name=403:40></a> And this is the very definition of the word given by writers of the apostles' time.<a name=403:41></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have thus, dear brother, given you rapidly, as far as a letter allowed, the way the question has actually come before me, and my reply.<a name=403:42></a> The effect in destroying responsibility was fearful and, in people with grosser habits, rejection of all truth and immorality.<a name=403:43></a> The tree was bad, had a bad sap, and so was cut down, and there was an end of it.<a name=403:44></a> Where are sin and atonement there?<a name=403:45></a> One, the most eminent, quiet and most guarded (who had learnt much truth from brethren in England, and a very popular preacher), said, he believed that the elect were the only souls God meant to exist; the rest were the fruit of man's lust after the fall.<a name=403:46></a> When asked how he would reconcile the doctrine of this perishing of souls simply bad and responsibility as stated in scripture, he said he could not, but, as he found it there, he did not deny it.<a name=403:47></a> But he was wholly a materialist as to the truth of a soul; he would not call it material, but it is born by mere physical generation.<a name=403:48></a> I regret to have to refer to such things.<a name=403:49></a> Keep your mind simple if you can by grace, and receive what scripture says in simplicity as it stands.<a name=403:50></a> I think I have some tracts on it, but written when I had not tracked it out as I had to do in America, particularly New York and Boston but elsewhere too.<a name=403:51></a> Thank God, several were delivered and found clearly it was Satan's power, others arrested who were in danger.<a name=403:52></a> I will look up the tracts to send them.<a name=403:53></a>

		Here things are going on with wonderful rapidity towards the end, though I know it is limited by the Lord's having gathered out His own, short or long as is needed for that.<a name=405:19></a> But it is a time not hard to discern; men's minds unsettling from what seemed established, and the question before us for faith, How far is there power to gather?<a name=405:20></a> I do not a moment doubt the power of Christ nor His faithfulness.<a name=405:21></a> He will surely gather His own for Himself.<a name=405:22></a> But we ought to manifest His glory.<a name=405:23></a> This is what we must seek.<a name=405:24></a> The brethren are going on well, here really very much so.<a name=405:25></a> Only they want a little stirring up in some places, and there is lack of labourers -- their numbers greatly increased.<a name=405:26></a> But when one sees the immense mass afloat just now, and the rising power of evil, what is it?<a name=405:27></a> But there is One sufficient.<a name=405:28></a>

		[<i>From the French</i>.<a name=407:1></a>] -- - Have I spoken to you of the division of the Epistle to the Romans, which has taken up my thoughts much of late?<a name=407:2></a> With verse 11 of chapter 5 the first part of the epistle closes, in which the apostle is occupied with sins; chapter 3, the blood; chapter 4, the resurrection for us.<a name=407:3></a> At verse 12 of chapter 5 it is a question of Adam and Christ, and thenceforward <i>of sin</i>: not only Christ has died for us, but we are dead; chapter 5: 1-11, the result in joy of one of these truths; chapter 8, of the other.<a name=407:4></a> In chapter 8 our position is more excellent, but in chapter 5, it seems to me, God is more known in grace, or rather more known <i>in Himself</i>; but the great point is, sins and sin.<a name=407:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another thing, which has been of great blessing to me in thinking of the Epistle to the Ephesians.<a name=407:6></a> Responsibility depends on the revelation that God makes of Himself: the Creator, a God of goodness, with Adam; the Lawgiver at Sinai; now, perfectly revealed in Christ.<a name=407:7></a> In Ephesians 4, the new man, the Holy Spirit -- subjectively.<a name=407:8></a> In Ephesians 5, imitators of God in love; to walk in love, as Christ hath loved us, and has given Himself <i>for</i> us, <i>to</i> God -- not to love as one loves oneself, but to give oneself absolutely <i>for</i>, but (in order that the motive be perfect) <i>to</i> God.<a name=407:9></a> We behave as "imitators of God," as His dear children.<a name=407:10></a> One of the two names of that which God <i>is</i>, is love; only we <i>are</i> not love, for God is sovereign and absolute in love -- He is God.<a name=407:11></a> The other name is light: we "are light in the Lord.<a name=407:12></a>" Christ is the measure in both cases.<a name=407:13></a> "As Christ has loved us;" "Christ shall give thee light.<a name=407:14></a>" What a practical position in grace!<a name=407:15></a> How miserable one is if not a Christian!<a name=407:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All depends on the fact that we are dead and risen, and that as receiving Christ who is.<a name=407:17></a> In His death He met all our responsibilities as children of Adam responsible in this world; but He has gained for us a place, according to the counsels of God before the world was.<a name=407:18></a> Compare 2 Timothy 1 and Titus 1, where it is no question of our responsibility, but of the purpose of God; only, inasmuch as we are a <i>purchased</i> people, we see that it is by the value of the act of Christ that we are so, by His sacrifice on the cross, which has fully glorified God.<a name=407:19></a>

		[F G Patterson] [<i>To the same</i>.<a name=409:25></a>] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- As regards immersion, I have a little doubt from 1 Corinthians 10 whether it was strictly dipping; but I do not think it was originally sprinkling.<a name=409:26></a> In the English system, at first, it was only allowed on certifying weakness in the child.<a name=409:27></a> In the Greek it is not allowed at all.<a name=409:28></a> Buried and death is the idea which implies something like immersion -- at least, going into the water, and then being covered with it by pouring, as was in the sea and the cloud.<a name=409:29></a> But I should not think of repeating a <i>bon fide</i> baptism because of the greater or smaller quantity of water, any more than I should think I had not taken the Lord's supper if the pieces had been partially cut up before celebrating the supper.<a name=409:30></a> But I should follow what I believed the fullest <i>figure</i> of the truth when I could.<a name=409:31></a>

		As to the formulary, the variation in the terms, eij" the name of Jesus, the Lord Jesus, Jesus Christ, are a plain proof that these words are not the formulary at all, which I think our good friends have overlooked.<a name=409:32></a> Next, remark that they had no direction to baptise <i>at all</i>, save the commission in Matthew (though at the same time that was only to the Gentiles).<a name=409:33></a> But as none other is given, I always use that of Matthew -- yet invariably, before this question arose, bringing in the special recognition of the Lord Jesus, as the One to whom the child was as baptised.<a name=409:34></a> But there is little scriptural light on the subject, our place being the gathering of the faithful into the consciousness of their place in the midst of a great baptised house.<a name=409:35></a> St.<a name=409:36></a> Paul was not sent to baptise, so that we have, as united in one Body, <i>no</i> commission.<a name=409:37></a> It is not abrogated, and we take it up as we find it, as Paul did.<a name=409:38></a> The attempt to set right this way fails.<a name=409:39></a> Peter and the others began, even with Cornelius -- namely, a Gentile -- with the names of the Lord.<a name=409:40></a> Yet the command as to the nations, of which this was the first specimen, is in Matthew 28.<a name=409:41></a> Samaritans, who were not Jews, were baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus, and it is hard to see how they went clean against Matthew 28, even if baptism of the Jews is said to be another, which I can not admit, because "there is .<a name=409:42></a>.<a name=409:43></a>.<a name=409:44></a> <i>one</i> baptism.<a name=409:45></a>" Hence I conclude that "the Lord Jesus," "Jesus," gives merely the thought and bearing of the baptism -- that it was in His name, under His authority and owning Him it was done -- but "Father, Son, and Holy Ghost," the full truth to which they were baptised.<a name=409:46></a> It is by Him we have the knowledge of the Trinity; the Father and the Holy Ghost through and with Himself.<a name=409:47></a> That which some took up, that the commission of Matthew dropped and Paul's began afresh for the Gentiles, has no application here, because Jesus Christ, and the Lord, are used before that was the case.<a name=409:48></a> Acts 2: 38 shews it began thus.<a name=409:49></a> But the name of Jesus Christ is only as owning Him and by His authority -- the confession of Jesus Christ.<a name=409:50></a> Here it is ejpiv, not eij"; in other places eij", as chapter 8: 16; ejn, chapter 10: 48, shewing, I judge, that it was more the nature and purport of the baptism than the form.<a name=409:51></a> Hence, my habit is to immerse unless there is special hindrance, or, at any rate, standing in the bath pour water over them, using both the name of the Lord Jesus, and the words of Matthew 28.<a name=409:52></a> I am not aware of any special connection of the <i>term</i> Lord and (the) House; Lord and servants seems to me the more scriptural correlation.<a name=409:53></a> The importance is that it is <i>individual</i>, which is not without its weight.<a name=409:54></a> We are a habitation of God through the Spirit.<a name=409:55></a> Christ is as <i>Son</i> over the House, but that is another idea from Lord, though of course He be Lord of all.<a name=409:56></a>

		[R T Grant] [<i>To the same</i>.<a name=414:1></a>] MY BELOVED BROTHER, -- Our letters have about crossed, but I take up my pen by reason of the question you raise as to the bride: more than one has been raised on it, some applying it wholly to the earthly Jerusalem.<a name=414:2></a> It may not be our highest position, and may be connected with a <i>help-meet</i> in the kingdom when all was <i>subject</i>; its distinction, however, from the earthly Jerusalem is clear.<a name=414:3></a> On the other hand, the main point is the distinction of the body: that is our own proper place connected with and founded on the exaltation of Christ to the right hand of God.<a name=414:4></a> I have therefore no conscious <i>a priori</i> objection, if it be not the habits of thought which always exercise some influence, and particularly when one is an old man, more fixed than recipient, and I am not young.<a name=414:5></a> But I have not yet been able to make the bride the Lamb's wife other than the church.<a name=414:6></a> The Book of Revelation decides nothing absolutely.<a name=414:7></a> It says, "the bride, the Lamb's wife," and, "the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.<a name=414:8></a>" If the nations of those who are saved, who walk in the light of it [are] contrasted with the kings of the <i>earth</i>, that indeed would decide the matter, and shews Abraham's place, which has made a difficulty to some minds; but this I could not affirm.<a name=414:9></a> Still up to the present, I am not able to see anything else but the church.<a name=414:10></a> The contrast with Babylon, and His wife having made herself ready, seems to point out the present period in contrast with church corruption.<a name=414:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The espousing to Christ, to which you refer, points to the same thing, but I hardly see how Ephesians 5 can be taken otherwise, for surely it points to the <i>present relationship</i> of Christ as Christ, which can hardly apply to the Old Testament saints when He was not Christ at all -- the nourishing and cherishing it, as a man his own flesh, for we are members of His body, we are of His flesh and of His bones.<a name=414:12></a> This in every way connects itself with Christ become man, and though, as you urge, the church is not termed wife, because in fact that marriage is not come, yet surely it goes from the thought of this relationship, and refers to the relationship of Eve, and connects the thought of membership of the body with being of His flesh and of His bones; that is, the body and the wife.<a name=414:13></a> The body is not <i>de facto</i> more complete than the wife, though no doubt present union of members exists with the Head.<a name=414:14></a> The marriage is clearly future.<a name=414:15></a> Still Ephesians 5 seems to me to identify the body and the wife.<a name=414:16></a> Bride is not a leading Pauline thought, but Old Testament and <i>figurative</i>.<a name=414:17></a> Union and membership is actual and real.<a name=414:18></a> Hence we do not find the bride so much in Paul, but in Revelation, which goes on prophetic ground, but transfers to heaven the images of prophecy.<a name=414:19></a> But I do not think the twelve tribes shew Israel -- no more than the angels, angelic beings -- making part of the city: both I esteem characteristic.<a name=414:20></a> The providential power administered by angels, and direct government of Jehovah, as well as apostolic foundation, characterise the church, not so much Paul as the twelve, even so.<a name=414:21></a> Abraham's looking for the city does not exactly make him to be the city: it is another line of thought .<a name=414:22></a>.<a name=414:23></a>.<a name=414:24></a> .<a name=414:25></a>

		The agitation is very great in these countries, even in England.<a name=414:26></a> There is recrudescence on the Bethesda question, though but little as yet, but in Ireland and Scotland plenty; many being in movement, and leaving the Establishment, and in Ireland many meetings being formed without much knowing what they are about, through the labours of young men very hot against the Establishment, rather revivalist, and hitherto knowing nothing of the unity of the body; but there is progress -- pretty decided as to breaking with evil, but not yet aware of its craft, so as to assure one they will keep it out; but the Lord is faithful.<a name=414:27></a> The brethren are going on happily enough, both in England and Ireland, and there is general growth and peace, though infirmity here and there.<a name=414:28></a>

		But I go farther; and it is the case in question.<a name=418:15></a> Suppose in an assembly a person has been put out for evil.<a name=418:16></a> All admit that such, if truly humbled, should be restored.<a name=418:17></a> The assembly think he is humbled truly; I am satisfied, suppose, that he is not.<a name=418:18></a> They receive him.<a name=418:19></a> Am I to break with the assembly or to refuse subjection to their act, because I think them mistaken?<a name=418:20></a> Supposing (which is a more trying case to the heart) I believe he is humbled and they are satisfied he is not, I may bow to a judgment I think erroneous and look to the Lord to set it right.<a name=418:21></a> There is such a thing as lowliness as to self, which does not set up its own opinion against others, though one may have no doubt of being right.<a name=418:22></a>

		There is another question connected with it -- one assembly's act binding another.<a name=418:23></a> I do not admit, because scripture does not admit, independent assemblies.<a name=418:24></a> There is the body of Christ, and all Christians are members of it; and the church of God in one place represents the whole and acts in its name.<a name=418:25></a> Hence, in 1 Corinthians, where the subject is treated of, all Christians are taken in with the assembly at Corinth as such; yet this last is treated as the body as such, and made locally responsible for maintaining the purity of the assembly; and the Lord Christ is looked at as there; and what was done was done <i>in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ</i>.<a name=418:26></a> This is wholly ignored when one speaks of six or seven clever, intelligent Christians, and a number of ignorant ones.<a name=418:27></a> The Lord in the midst of the assembly is set aside.<a name=418:28></a> The flesh, it is said, often acts in the assembly.<a name=418:29></a> Why assume it does, and forget it may in an individual?<a name=418:30></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, why speak of obeying the Lord first, then the church?<a name=418:31></a> But supposing the Lord is in the church?<a name=418:32></a> It is merely setting up private judgment against the judgment of an assembly meeting in Christ's name with His promise (if they are not, I have nothing to say to them); it is simply saying, I count myself wiser than those who are.<a name=418:33></a> I reject entirely as unscriptural the saying, "First Christ, then the Church.<a name=418:34></a>" If Christ be not in the church, I do not own it at all.<a name=418:35></a> I assume that the church has not Christ, making them two parties.<a name=418:36></a> I may reason with an assembly, because I am a member of Christ, and hence of it -- if it is one, help it.<a name=418:37></a> But if I own to it as an assembly of God, I cannot assume Christ is not there.<a name=418:38></a> It is simply denying it is an assembly of God.<a name=418:39></a> The thought is wanting of what an assembly of God is.<a name=418:40></a> This is not surprising; but it necessarily falsifies judgment on the point, which is not "if the word" -- but if I <i>see</i> not the word for it.<a name=418:41></a> It is just trusting one's own judgment as against others and the assembly of God.<a name=418:42></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Allow me to put the question as to minor questions in another shape.<a name=418:46></a> Suppose I am of another assembly, and I think they judge something in a mistaken way, am I to <i>impose</i> my individual way of thinking <i>on them</i>?<a name=418:47></a> If not, what am I to do?<a name=418:48></a> Leave the assembly of God if it be such (if not I do not go there)?<a name=418:49></a> You cannot help yourself.<a name=418:50></a> If I do not continue in an assembly, because it does not agree with me in everything, I can be of no assembly of God in the world.<a name=418:51></a> All this is simply a denial of the presence and help of God's Spirit and of the faithfulness of Christ to His own people.<a name=418:52></a> I cannot see godly lowliness in it.<a name=418:53></a>

		But if an assembly have judged as such in a case of discipline, admitting all brotherly communications and remonstrances, I distinctly say another assembly should, on the face of it, receive their act.<a name=418:54></a> If the wicked man is put out at Corinth, is Ephesus to receive him?<a name=418:55></a> Where then is unity?<a name=418:56></a> where the Lord in the midst of the church?<a name=418:57></a> What led me out of the Establishment was the unity of the body: where it is not owned and acted on, I should not go.<a name=418:58></a> And of independent churches I think quite as ill, or worse, than of the Establishment.<a name=418:59></a> But if each assembly acts independently of another and receives independently of it, then it has rejected that unity -- they are independent churches.<a name=418:60></a> There is no practical unity of the body.<a name=418:61></a>

		Dear Miss Thompson, -- I think the person who answered the question was frightened by the word infallibility, which I am not.<a name=421:1></a> It is simply the poor and transparent piece of sophistry of confounding authority with infallibility.<a name=421:2></a> In a hundred instances obedience may be obligatory where there is no infallibility.<a name=421:3></a> Were it not so, as you can easily see, there could be no order in the world at all.<a name=421:4></a> There is no infallibility in it, but a great deal of self-will; and if there be no obedience where there is not infallibility, no acquiescence in what has been decided, there is no end to self-will and no existence of common order.<a name=421:5></a> The question is of competence, not of infallibility.<a name=421:6></a> A father is not infallible, but he has divinely given authority, and acquiescence is a duty.<a name=421:7></a> A police magistrate is not infallible, but he has competent authority in the cases submitted to his jurisdiction.<a name=421:8></a> There may be resources against abuse of authority, or, in certain cases, a refusal of it, when a higher obliges us, as a conscience directed by God's word: "We ought to obey God rather than man.<a name=421:9></a>" But there is never in scripture liberty given to the human will as such: we are sanctified to the obedience of Christ.<a name=421:10></a> And this principle, our doing God's will in simple obedience without solving every abstract question which may be raised, is a path of peace, which many heads miss who think themselves wise, because it is the path of God's wisdom.<a name=421:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The question therefore is a mere and poor sophistry which betrays the desire to have the will free, and a confidence that the person's judgment is superior to all that has been already judged.<a name=421:12></a> There is judicial authority in the church of God, and if there were not, it would be the most horrible iniquity on earth; because it would put the sanction of Christ's name on every iniquity.<a name=421:13></a> And that is what was sought and pleaded for by those with whom these questions originated: that what ever iniquity or leaven was allowed, it could not leaven an assembly.<a name=421:14></a> Such views have done good.<a name=421:15></a> They have the cordial abhorrence and rejection of every honest mind, and of every one who does not seek to justify evil.<a name=421:16></a> It is possible you may think or say, that is not the question I am asking.<a name=421:17></a> Forgive me for saying, I know that it is and that only; though you do not, I am well assured.<a name=421:18></a> But the judicial authority of the church of God is in <i>obedience</i> to the word.<a name=421:19></a> "Do not ye judge them that are within?<a name=421:20></a> but them that are without God judgeth.<a name=421:21></a> Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.<a name=421:22></a>" And I repeat, if it be not done, the church of God becomes the accrediting of every vileness of sin: and I affirm distinctly, that when this is done, other Christians are bound to respect it.<a name=421:23></a> There are remedies for fleshly action in it, in the presence of the Spirit of God amongst the saints, and in the supreme authority of the Lord Jesus Christ; but that remedy is not the totally unscriptural and miserable one proposed by the question -- the pretension of competency in every one who takes it into his head to judge for themselves independent of <i>what God has instituted</i>.<a name=421:24></a> It is, taken in its most favourable aspect, not as individual pretension which is its real character, the well-known and unscriptural system which has been known since Cromwell's time -- that is, Independency: one body of Christians being independent of every other as a voluntary association.<a name=421:25></a> This is a simple denial of the unity of the body, and the presence and action of the Holy Ghost in it.<a name=421:26></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Supposing we were a body of Freemasons, and a person was excluded from one lodge by the rules of the order, and if instead of looking to the lodge to review the case, it was thought to be unjust, and each other lodge was to receive them or not on its own independent authority, it is clear the unity of the Freemason system is gone: each lodge is an independent body acting for itself.<a name=421:27></a> It is in vain to allege a wrong done, and the lodge not being infallible; the competent authority of lodges and the unity of the whole is at an end: the system is dissolved.<a name=421:28></a> There may be provisions for such difficulties -- all right if it be needed.<a name=421:29></a> But the proposed remedy is the mere pretension of the superiority of the recusant lodge and a dissolution of Freemasonry.<a name=421:30></a> Now I openly reject, in the most absolute way, the pretended competency of one church or assembly to judge the other as the question proposes; but what is more important, it is an unscriptural denial of the whole structure of the church of God.<a name=421:31></a> It is Independency, a system I knew forty years ago and would never join.<a name=421:32></a> If people like that system, let them go to it.<a name=421:33></a> It is in vain to say it is not that.<a name=421:34></a> Independency merely means that each church judges for itself independently of another.<a name=421:35></a> And that is all that is claimed here.<a name=421:36></a> I have no quarrel with those who, liking to judge for themselves, prefer this system; only I am perfectly satisfied that in every respect it is wholly unscriptural.<a name=421:37></a> The church is not a voluntary system.<a name=421:38></a> It is not formed (or rather unformed) of a number of independent bodies each acting for itself.<a name=421:39></a> It was never dreamed, whatever the remedy, that Antioch could let in Gentiles and Jerusalem not, and all go on according to the order of the church of God.<a name=421:40></a> There is not a trace of such independency and disorder in the word.<a name=421:41></a> There is every possible evidence, in fact and doctrine insisted on, of there being a body on earth whose unity was the foundation of blessing in fact, and its maintenance the duty of every Christian.<a name=421:42></a> Self-will may wish it otherwise, but certainly not grace and obedience to the word.<a name=421:43></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Difficulties may arise; we have not an apostolic centre, as there was at Jerusalem.<a name=421:44></a> Quite true; but we have a resource in the action of the Spirit in the unity of the body, the action of healing grace and helpful gift, and the faithfulness of a gracious Lord who has promised never to leave us nor forsake us.<a name=421:45></a> But the case of Jerusalem in Acts 15 is a proof that the scriptural church never thought of, and did not accept, the independent action insisted upon.<a name=421:46></a> The action of the Holy Ghost was in the unity of the body, and is always so.<a name=421:47></a> The action directed by the apostle at Corinth (and which binds us as the word of God) was operative in respect of the whole church of God, and all are contemplated in the opening of the epistle.<a name=421:48></a> Does any one mean to pretend, that if he was to be put out at Corinth judicially, each church was to judge for itself whether he was to be received -- that judicial act pass for nothing, or operative only at Corinth, and Ephesus or Cenchrea do as it liked afterwards?<a name=421:49></a> Where, then, was the solemn act and direction of the apostle?<a name=421:50></a> Well, that authority and that direction are the word of God for us now.<a name=421:51></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I am quite aware it will be said, Yes: but you may not follow it rightly, as the flesh may act.<a name=421:52></a> It is possible.<a name=421:53></a> There <i>is possibility</i> that the flesh may act.<a name=421:54></a> But I am quite certain that what denies the unity of the church, sets up for itself, and dissolves it into independent bodies, is the dissolution of the church of God, <i>unscriptural</i>, and <i>nothing but flesh</i>.<a name=421:55></a> It is therefore judged for me before I go any further.<a name=421:56></a> There is a remedy, a blessed, precious remedy of humble minds, in the help of God's Spirit in the unity of the body, and the Lord's faithful love and care, as I have said; but not in the pretentious will which sets up for itself and denies the church of God.<a name=421:57></a> My answer to the question is, then, that the plea is a miserable sophistry, confounding infallibility and divinely-ordained authority met by lowly grace; and the system sought by the question, the pretentious spirit of independency, a rejection of the whole authority of scripture in its teaching on the subject of the church -- a setting up of man instead of God.<a name=421:58></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am not very careful or anxious to answer the second question.<a name=421:59></a> It is clear that if two or three are gathered together it is an assembly, and if scripturally assembled, an assembly of God; and if not, what else?<a name=421:60></a> If the only one in the place, it is the assembly of God in the place, yet I do object practically to taking the title, because the assembly of God in any place properly embraces all the saints in the place; and there is practical danger for souls in assuming the name, as losing sight of the ruin, and setting up to be something: but it is not <i>false</i> in the supposed case.<a name=421:61></a> But if there be one such, and another is set up by man's will independent of it, the first only is morally in God's sight the assembly of God, and the other is not at all so, because it is set up in independency of the unity of the body.<a name=421:62></a> I reject in the most entire and unhesitating manner the whole independent system, which is the only real object of the question, as unscriptural, and a positive, unmitigated evil.<a name=421:63></a> Now that the unity of the body has been brought out, and the scriptural truth of it known, it is simply a work of Satan.<a name=421:64></a> Ignorance of the truth is one thing, our common lot in many ways; opposition to it another.<a name=421:65></a> The miserable use, made by unprincipled persons, trying to make capital out of it, of an expression used with a perfectly right intention in London, I pass under the silence it deserves.<a name=421:66></a> The truth of God is the same, whether an expression used by Mr.<a name=421:67></a> -- be right or wrong.<a name=421:68></a>

		I may add, that I know it is alleged that the church is now so in ruins that scriptural order according to the unity of the body cannot be maintained.<a name=421:70></a> Then let the objectors avow, as honest men, that they seek unscriptural order, or rather disorder.<a name=421:71></a> But in truth it is impossible to meet at all in that case to break bread, except in defiance of God's word; for scripture says, "We being many are one body: for we are all partakers of that one loaf.<a name=421:72></a>" We profess to be one body whenever we break bread; scripture knows nothing else.<a name=421:73></a> And they will find scripture too strong and perfect a bond for man's reasoning to break it.<a name=421:74></a><br>1866.<a name=421:75></a>

		[<i>To the same</i>.<a name=425:1></a>] Miss Thompson, As regards what I said as to a higher claim of obedience, it is the safeguard against the exercise of authority where there is not infallibility.<a name=425:2></a> Thus Christ tells His disciples to obey the scribes sitting in Moses' seat; but when they tell them not to preach Christ, they cannot obey them, because God had told them to do otherwise.<a name=425:3></a> A parent's authority is sacred: he tells me (say I was a Jew) not to become a Christian: I disobey him because there is a higher obligation.<a name=425:4></a> It is important morally, because no departure or rejection of legitimate authority can be based on our own will or self in any way, but on the direct authority of God.<a name=425:5></a> Never have <i>I</i> a right, but I ought to obey.<a name=425:6></a> And it is simple that, if it be the authority God has given to a parent or magistrate, or whoever it may be, which leads me to obey them, as it is, it cannot be real when it calls me to disobey God's direct command.<a name=425:7></a> But obedience is always our path.<a name=425:8></a>

		I get then in Revelation the bride, the Lamb's wife, described in contrast with the corrupt Rome, Babylon, the idolatrous harlot.<a name=426:38></a> Now I can understand the earthly Jerusalem, the King's wife, being opposed to this on earth, but I find no scripture recognising anything in this relationship but the church: no husband known before Christ (save Jehovah and Israel).<a name=426:39></a> Where the wife is not in question, I find them still characteristically contrasted in heaven, as in Hebrews 12: 23 and 11: 40.<a name=426:40></a> I admit that the heavenly Jerusalem is a comparatively vague term, contrasted with the earthly Jerusalem as the capital of heavenly power; but I find no use of bride and wife in the New Testament in any sense but the church.<a name=426:41></a> When I come to the end of Revelation, and the present relationship of the church is in question, as at the beginning; I find (chapter 22: 17) "The Spirit and the bride say, Come.<a name=426:42></a>" It is not the revealing prophetic part -- the book itself; and I know not what expects Him thus but the church.<a name=426:43></a> Verse 16 shews it is a present thing.<a name=426:44></a> I remember Bellett's having an idea that the marriage was put off to let in the saints of the beast's time to have a place in this, but he gave it up: this would not reach the ground you take.<a name=426:45></a> And though the Lamb is the Redeemer of all, it is as the actually rejected One He is here seen, as I am persuaded; and the separation of the body and the bride, though the relationship be twofold, seems to dissolve the force of Ephesians 5, which teaches me He reckons the wife as a man does his own flesh.<a name=426:46></a> The contrast with Babylon makes Revelation 19 confirmatory to me, otherwise it is the thing to be inquired into, not the proof of what it is.<a name=426:47></a> The other view is at best a deduction and conclusion.<a name=426:48></a> There is no evidence of anything being called bride or wife but the church; but I am glad to hear anything.<a name=426:49></a> I think the sense of relationship important, and hence should search carefully into the proof of this one when in question.<a name=426:50></a> Omitting "of them that are saved" (Revelation 21: 24) only makes it clearer.<a name=426:51></a> I always applied it to those that were spared in the judgments, but it is much simpler without it.<a name=426:52></a>

		As regards 1 John 1: 7, like all his writings, it is abstract; not "has cleansed," or "will cleanse," but "cleanses": it is its value and nature.<a name=426:53></a> So verse 9: when a man confesses his sins truly before God on his first conversion, he is forgiven.<a name=426:54></a> If I do so (in another way no doubt) as to a Father, when I am a Christian, I am forgiven -- as regards the ways and government of God, I am forgiven.<a name=426:55></a> To "say that we have no sin" (verse 8) is ignorance of myself: "If we say that we have not sinned" (verse 10) is plain denial of God's testimony, but "have not" is past, we are not supposed to be sinning.<a name=426:56></a> "We have no sin" is present, because it is a nature in me which the truth makes me know.<a name=426:57></a>

		I have written in a number of times, being excessively occupied; much movement, constant inquiry, of course great opposition, but progress, and several added, some having had to give up at present everything: great effort to keep up loose principles, but the conscientious and zealous delivered, a very great many; and now they have settled tighter ones on dissenting principles, to try and keep them -- not Bethesda, but a place set up, a kind of fruit of reservation on purpose to leave a kind of free preaching, and then broke bread there.<a name=426:58></a> It is the last place whose influence I should think healthful, but brought many out of the Establishment, because they are bound to nothing; but those who felt for the Lord's glory at His table are out: of course, they are very angry, but there has been distinct blessing and progress.<a name=426:59></a> But I have been incessantly occupied; the work <i>very</i> fatiguing, wearing by adverse subtle questions sometimes, but interesting, and, thank God, the Lord with me.<a name=426:60></a> I have been very peaceful through it, and feel His hand and approbation, but am as to my body worn, from six to past twelve never ceasing.<a name=426:61></a> It is all moving, so that I could hardly tell you what is going on in detail, but great truths are making way, and many consciences have.<a name=426:62></a>

		[H H Snell] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I trust I should retract at once if I thought I was in error, especially in what concerns the blessed Lord Himself.<a name=432:1></a> I am quite ready to admit, and have admitted over and over again, that doubtless expressions may be made clearer.<a name=432:2></a> My principal difficulty to bring my mind to bear on it is the character of the objections.<a name=432:3></a> I admit the objectors have succeeded in troubling some; but I find daily many of these the moment they <i>have read</i> what I have written perfectly tranquil .<a name=432:4></a>.<a name=432:5></a>.<a name=432:6></a> .<a name=432:7></a> I should be ready to explain to the humblest and most ignorant.<a name=432:8></a> But the attacks have not commanded my respect.<a name=432:9></a> I am aware the enemy has succeeded in troubling some, and leading others to profit by it, to hinder souls whose consciences were making progress; but the Lord has a long look out.<a name=432:10></a> Our faith has to wait for Him, and such I seek for myself.<a name=432:11></a> I only fear that it may leave some, for whom I had hoped better, in the mud they have sought to create.<a name=432:12></a> I only ask to be enabled to do at each moment what is right in the matter, believing, though it be the enemy's work, it will do good.<a name=432:13></a> I proposed to the brethren to go out of communion, and leave off ministering (not for any difficulty I had), but to leave them perfectly free; but they would not hear of it in these parts, and in many others.<a name=432:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am not the least uneasy myself.<a name=432:15></a> I feel distinctly it is an effort of the enemy, and that he will be baffled; but I do not want to <i>involve</i> others in it, nor will I make it a matter of self defence, mingling that up with the Lord's glory, and raising discussions, when it ought with such a subject to be edification.<a name=432:16></a> As regards connecting it, or comparing it, with Mr.<a name=432:17></a> N.<a name=432:18></a>'s doctrine, were it not for the pure wickedness of what set it a-going, it would be beneath contempt.<a name=432:19></a> To say that being born in a state, and seeking to extricate oneself, and not being able till death, is the same as being born in the very opposite, and always walking in that state, and entering into the sufferings of another in grace, does not deserve to be reasoned on.<a name=432:20></a> The same thing!<a name=432:21></a> One makes the other impossible.<a name=432:22></a> I cannot condescend to take notice of these attacks: those who get entangled in them must count the cost for themselves.<a name=432:23></a> Explain my own views, or unfold the truth as far as I can, this I am ready to do; but I am in no hurry: I do not want to get defending myself, but prefer trusting the Lord, who will make things clear.<a name=432:24></a> Some parts of it are a new kind of trial, but there is grace enough in Christ for it, and I leave all that without great difficulty to God.<a name=432:25></a> We shall find out where He is leading.<a name=432:26></a> May the Lord save as many as possible from Satan's power in it.<a name=432:27></a> I am ready to do all I can towards it, where it is really sought.<a name=432:28></a> I have no doubt many expressions may be made clearer; but, if honestly examined in the context, they cannot have the sense attached to them.<a name=432:29></a> In substance, instead of having to retract, I believe my enemies to be in very mischievous and evil error, going far to deny the reality of Christ's sufferings, and thus depriving Him of a blessed part of His glory, and us of the deepest comfort and vital truth.<a name=432:30></a>

		I can easily understand that what relates to the remnant of Israel may not be understood, and hence that part is difficult to enter into.<a name=432:31></a> That does not trouble me.<a name=432:32></a> But the denial of Christ's sufferings, where these are real, is another matter; and, allow me to say, though I shall reply to your questions out of the New Testament, you cannot understand that subject without referring to the Old.<a name=432:33></a> Nor can I consent to give up that which was able to make men "wise unto salvation, through faith that is in Christ Jesus.<a name=432:34></a>" I am aware that Mr.<a name=432:35></a> N.<a name=432:36></a> said his doctrine was not in the New Testament, but in the Psalms; but one of the devices of Satan is to deprive us of truth by connecting it with deadly error.<a name=432:37></a> This is one source of trouble to honest minds now; but it is a reason for going peacefully on in the truth itself, and having patience with people's minds.<a name=432:38></a> His doctrine was in neither.<a name=432:39></a> Nor do I admit such a principle.<a name=432:40></a> For the Old Testament throws infinite light on what we have often only the fact of in the New.<a name=432:41></a> There is sufficient in the New to connect it with the Old, as in the case of Christ's sacrifice, but far more detail in the Old.<a name=432:42></a> If you expect to find the details as to the remnant of Israel in the New, you will be disappointed.<a name=432:43></a> Mr.<a name=432:44></a> N.<a name=432:45></a> connected the blessed Lord with sinful, guilty Israel, and hence had necessarily a false Christ.<a name=432:46></a> I say He entered into the sorrows and sufferings of the godly remnant.<a name=432:47></a> It is never stated in my papers that He is in the place that brought them on.<a name=432:48></a> The attacks on me are founded on a deadly error: that entering into the sufferings, or suffering with them in heart and grace, supposes Himself to be in the state or place which brought them on.<a name=432:49></a> Christ was baptised with the baptism of repentance.<a name=432:50></a> Was He in the case, or state, or position to need it?<a name=432:51></a> Every Christian knows that He was not, yet He submitted to that, or went through it.<a name=432:52></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#432:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>'The question is, Is there such a class of sufferings in the New Testament. If I mistake not, I learned through your teaching many years ago, in the Newtonian controversy, that the New Testament shewed us, first, the Lord suffering as man for righteousness sake; secondly, suffering from God as the substitute for sinners on the cross; and that a third class was then excluded, I forget the exact words. Could the blessed Lord be smitten by God otherwise than as an offering for sin upon the cross? If smiting were necessitated on the blessed Lord, except as the sin-bearer, does it not obscure the glory of the cross?'

		[H H Snell] [<i>To the same</i>.<a name=438:1></a>] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- As to your question as to page 36 ["Collected Writings," vol.<a name=438:2></a> 7 page 305], "This is not atonement, but there is sorrow and smiting" -- they had better read what the scripture does say, and see if they believe it, and seek to be taught of God, and whether they understand what is there, than pervert expressions to make them obnoxious.<a name=438:3></a> When it is said, "Those whom thou hast wounded" (Psalm 69: 26-27), it cannot mean atonement.<a name=438:4></a> The effect of atonement is not to say, "Add iniquity unto their iniquity, and let them not come into thy righteousness.<a name=438:5></a>" I say that atonement is not considered here, but the contrary.<a name=438:6></a> I believe the smiting was on the cross, and that there the atonement was wrought, but by the forsaking of God as to His soul; He was wounded there for Israel's transgressions; and scripture thus brings all into one point.<a name=438:7></a> But the smiting, or fact of His death, is not solely applied to atonement; it is referred to as cutting Messiah off instead of His taking the kingdom, or the sorrow of death itself; and it is looked at here certainly not as atoning in its effect, though the fact of His being smitten (when atonement was wrought) is spoken of.<a name=438:8></a> I believe the cutting off of Messiah is looked at fully in the Psalms as well as atonement.<a name=438:9></a> "He weakened my strength in my journey; he shortened my days.<a name=438:10></a> I said, O my God, cut me not off in the midst of my days" (Psalm 102: 23-24): this was not the aspect of atonement, though in that in which it was done atonement also was wrought.<a name=438:11></a> The thought is separated in scripture.<a name=438:12></a> "Smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered," is not, "I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.<a name=438:13></a>" It is mischievous to confound anything with the true work of atonement in the forsaking of God on the cross; and the fact of the removal of Messiah so as to scatter Israel, even the just, is contemplated in scripture, and spoken of distinctly.<a name=438:14></a> I have not said there were blows which were not atonement, but this -- sufferings in which others are associated, is not atonement, though there is smiting and wounded ones spoken of.<a name=438:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards the second point.<a name=438:16></a> People have taken the description of the state which they were in for whom Christ suffered, as if it was a statement of the state He was in; but for this there is no kind of ground.<a name=438:17></a> He entered into the sorrow and endured in His spirit what flowed from it, but He was not in it; and this I have frequently stated and went through it twenty years ago, in which I find this question was fully gone into as an answer to Newton.<a name=438:18></a> It is stated there,<a href="#438:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> "Christ, then, does enter in spirit into this sorrow of the remnant <i>fully</i>; but it is not <i>His</i> relation to God as due to Him as associated with the people.<a name=438:19></a>" This is the tract which has been quoted to say I then thought such sufferings must be excluded.<a name=438:20></a> Christ went through what enabled Him to feel for people not reconciled to God.<a name=438:21></a> He was not in an unreconciled state; to say that would be blasphemy.<a name=438:22></a> But was not He dreading wrath?<a name=438:23></a> He had to go through really that which they are comparatively feebly dreading, and never will go through, because He has -- He did go through the dread of death, and cried to be delivered from it.<a name=438:24></a> He went through it (as I have stated in the tracts) in a different way, because in communion with His Father (not speaking of atonement, but fearing).<a name=438:25></a> Was it not Satan's hour and the power of darkness, He perfect in going through it with God, as I have expressly said?<a name=438:26></a> People may call it experience, or anything they like, but if they make it His experience as flowing from the state He was in, it is what I have expressly denied.<a name=438:27></a> But the same reasoning would apply to the atonement, though it be -- I admit it is -- a very different case; but if the suffering a thing proved that one was in the state that caused the suffering, then He was in it then before God.<a name=438:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is all a delusion applying the state He suffered for, and into the sorrow of which He entered, with being in the state which brings the sorrow.<a name=438:29></a> This last was Mr.<a name=438:30></a> N.<a name=438:31></a>'s doctrine -- born in it, extricating Himself out of it.<a name=438:32></a> Supposing, as I have said, a mother had her son hanged for thieving, and she was in agony at one so dear to her coming to such an end, would that prove she was a thief, though he was in agony at coming to such an end too; or, that she had a thief's experience?<a name=438:33></a> Yet she is in an agony because of one she loves being in it: it is not mere sympathy -- that she may shew too -- yea, conceal her distress to do so.<a name=438:34></a> There is the difference, that Christ really went on to take Himself the consequences.<a name=438:35></a> But it is the most extraordinary delusion to suppose that the description of the state a person is in spirit entering into, is a statement that he is in the state or relationship in respect of which he suffers.<a name=438:36></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have never, dear brother, stood up for the expressions.<a name=438:37></a> I attach no importance to them -- would give them all up tomorrow -- have said so in the preface to the tract.<a name=438:38></a> But the question has now been raised as to the doctrine: it has been said to be pretty much the same as Mr.<a name=438:39></a> N.<a name=438:40></a>'s.<a name=438:41></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is fully stated in my answer to him twenty years ago, as setting aside his doctrine, and shewing the true force of what he used.<a name=438:42></a> When the substance of the doctrine is cleared up, I shall have no difficulty in changing the expressions.<a name=438:43></a> The material thing at present is, is the doctrine dishonouring to Christ and false?<a name=438:44></a> Explain to any one that is stumbled, of course I am bound to do, but I do not hold to any expressions of it; only, I am not going to yield up the truth.<a name=438:45></a>

		[J Stancombe] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I am glad to have got your note,<a href="#441:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> for with the sincere affection I have for you, I was uneasy about you.<a name=441:1></a> I do not believe in general, nor in any, that but for N.<a name=441:2></a>'s errors, there would have been the least uneasiness as to my statements as regards the blessed Lord.<a name=441:3></a> But there has been a diligent effort to bring the character of Mr.<a name=441:4></a> N.<a name=441:5></a>'s doctrine, and a wrong to the Lord, upon them, from what source and in what spirit, God will judge.<a name=441:6></a> I will endeavour to answer you as plainly as I can.<a name=441:7></a> I was told only a day or two ago, what I had quite forgotten, of this saying there are two kinds of suffering to the exclusion of a third.<a name=441:8></a> Of course, there is an apparent contradiction.<a name=441:9></a> But the third class I excluded, as your own note states, was "the subjection of Christ to the wrath of God previous to the cross, as Christ being under wrath would be found in the epistles," etc.<a name=441:10></a> All this I fully hold still.<a name=441:11></a> I reject, as I always rejected, the doctrine of Christ being born, as man, or as Israel, subject to wrath from the state or position He was in, or His ever getting into a state or position in which He was subject to it Himself, or suffered for it as being Himself in that position or state -- that is, as liable to it.<a name=441:12></a> Even in atonement <i>He</i> was not liable to it, but made sin for others.<a name=441:13></a> And there is where the essential contradiction and opposition between my doctrine -- scriptural doctrine -- and Mr.<a name=441:14></a> N.<a name=441:15></a>'s is.<a name=441:16></a> It is not a question of time, as enemies of the truth have said, it is a difference of what Christ and Christ's place was.<a name=441:17></a> I hold to this more strongly, at any rate more intelligently, than ever.<a name=441:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But when I referred to the tract "Observations," while this expression, "exclusion of a third kind," is there, in view of this, I found what I have called a third kind, stated in nearly the same terms, only under the head of the second kind, and thus less defined.<a name=441:19></a> Have the kindness to read the pages 64, 65 ["Collected Writings," vol.<a name=441:20></a> 15 pages 144-146] of my "Observations," which I have now looked at in consequence of your note (I had wholly forgotten the contents of the tract).<a name=441:21></a> You will find all this very doctrine diligently used against Mr.<a name=441:22></a> N.<a name=441:23></a>'s and far more fully explained than I had the least idea of.<a name=441:24></a> You will find a series of explanations of Psalms, where they are more applied to Christ than even I should now, following still the influence of much current theology.<a name=441:25></a> I light on page 40 ["Collected Writings," vol.<a name=441:26></a> 15 page 109], "Christ then does enter in spirit into this sorrow of the remnant <i>fully</i>; but it is not <i>His</i> relation to God as due to Him as associated with the people.<a name=441:27></a>" Now I still reject in the same way, not only any sin in Christ, but any relationship to God save of perfect delight, excepting the forsaking for atonement, of course, though there perfectly acceptable in Himself -- never as to His work more so.<a name=441:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will state how people have been misled in a moment as to my last tract.<a name=441:29></a> See again the note on page 52.<a name=441:30></a> ["Collected Writings," vol.<a name=441:31></a> 15 page 127.<a name=441:32></a>] Now whether this be called a third kind of suffering, or classed under the second head, rejecting another and blasphemous kind attributed to Him, is really very little matter; it is a question of accuracy of form and analysis; but these kinds of sufferings are quite as fully gone into in the tract brought up against me, taken, as a reader of scripture must take them, for granted; and then it is elaborately shewn that they afford no handle for Mr.<a name=441:33></a> N.<a name=441:34></a>'s doctrine, but the contrary.<a name=441:35></a> That by which the minds of some have been misled is that in the tract on the sufferings, I have described the state of the remnant, and shewn the analogy of an upright soul under law, to shew what <i>in them</i> Christ had to help and succour them in, and how the circumstances He passed through enabled Him to do it; and this has been used to say, Christ was in the place Himself.<a name=441:36></a> He did suffer it, "in all their afflictions he was afflicted;" He did enter into their sorrows, but that, which is perfectly scriptural, does not put Him into the <i>state</i> which brought in the suffering; and that was Mr.<a name=441:37></a> N.<a name=441:38></a>'s doctrine, and made a false Christ.<a name=441:39></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When Christ healed, it is said, "He bore our sorrows and carried our sicknesses;" was He therefore sick?<a name=441:40></a> or is scripture wrong?<a name=441:41></a> He who puts Christ in that state has a false Christ.<a name=441:42></a> He who denies Christ's entering into our sorrows and sufferings, in order to succour -- not to atone -- loses half the blessing of what He is, and takes away a large part of His glory.<a name=441:43></a> There is the special entering into the sorrows of the remnant.<a name=441:44></a> But I have fully stated how He could.<a name=441:45></a> He was actually going forward towards wrath, which He did actually undergo; they are dreading it as having deserved it, though because He did, they will never undergo it: they were under the oppression of the Gentiles; so was He -- the wickedness of apostate Israel; so was He -- the betrayal or denial of friends; so was He.<a name=441:46></a> But these were of course circumstances.<a name=441:47></a> I do see in scripture that there was the cutting off of Messiah, and the rejection -- for the time wholly -- as to their former condition of God's beloved people, which His soul deeply entered into.<a name=441:48></a> That which was <i>on Israel</i> was governmental wrath; He did fully enter into it, but not because <i>He</i> was in the state that government applied to.<a name=441:49></a> This is expressly guarded in the tract on the sufferings, where the third kind is spoken of, in the passage T.<a name=441:50></a> Ryan purposely left out.<a name=441:51></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am satisfied that a dead set is made against the truth of Christ's real sufferings, by the attempt to confound what I have said with Mr.<a name=441:52></a> N.<a name=441:53></a>'s blasphemy, to which it is the direct opposite.<a name=441:54></a> People have laid hold of His meeting wrath and indignation, and changed it to under indignation and wrath, and even said personally under it, where in the same sentence it is said, "Nor is it His expiatory work" (namely, the particular view of Psalm 102, which I believe to be quite just), "though that which wrought it is here -- the indignation and wrath.<a name=441:55></a> It is Himself, His own being cut off as man.<a name=441:56></a>" Now I ask, in the smiting -- where the indignation and wrath which wrought atonement were -- is there no sorrow in this Psalm, besides indignation and wrath in atonement?<a name=441:57></a> His strength had been weakened in His journey, His days shortened.<a name=441:58></a> He had prayed not to be cut off in the midst of His days -- and this connected with God's arising and having mercy on Zion: was this real?<a name=441:59></a> The thought of atonement, of that one dreadful cup, is weakened, if we confound it with all these other sufferings, though they led to it, as in Psalm 22, but are there contrasted with it.<a name=441:60></a> If you identify them with atonement, you play into the hands of those who deny its real character and efficacy, and (I judge) blaspheme Christ's name.<a name=441:61></a> If you deny them, you pull down the truth, the most blessed truth of Christ's true sorrows, of His learning obedience by the things that He suffered, of that sorrow which above all touches the heart and makes us know His perfectness, who could say beyond any Jeremiah, "Was ever sorrow like unto my sorrow?<a name=441:62></a>" I have no wish to lose this.<a name=441:63></a> I have no intention to mix it up with the one solemn act of atonement which it led to.<a name=441:64></a> I think all this an effort of the enemy to injure souls.<a name=441:65></a> I am sure the upright and humble will escape, and many have already got blessing by weighing these sufferings more.<a name=441:66></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards the New Testament, I say distinctly that a special time of entering into these sorrows (personally, if my enemies like the word) is marked out.<a name=441:67></a> "His hour was not yet come": Luke 22: 35, etc.<a name=441:68></a>, clearly shews this change; and it is said at the beginning of that gospel, Satan departed from Him for a season.<a name=441:69></a> So Luke 22: 52-53.<a name=441:70></a> I may (though I do not believe it) be forced to give up my brethren, whatever sorrow it may be, but I will not (with God's help) give up the sorrows and the sufferings of my most gracious Lord.<a name=441:71></a> I will not falsify them by mixing them up with atonement, though that may be comparatively a less evil.<a name=441:72></a> The only difficulty that I know of for our minds, is the mixture of that which is distinguished in Psalm 22, between the expectation of the cross -- His meeting, as I have said, indignation and wrath -- and the wickedness of Jews and Gentiles, and Satan's power of darkness pressed on Him in circumstances, and the power of death.<a name=441:73></a> All was converging to the cross; <i>there</i> was the actual smiting, but it culminated in that which is yet clearly distinguished in Psalm 22 -- the forsaking of God, when sought as an answer to it.<a name=441:74></a> Now I cannot confound these; I cannot deny either.<a name=441:75></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe if souls had been seeking edification, and not listening to those who as instruments of evil were seeking mischief, they would have found edification and real blessing, even in my poor writings, with, I dare say, many a thing immaturely expressed, and where immaturely conceived, would have been corrected by grace and mature christian minds.<a name=441:76></a>

		The one point on which there might be difficulty is the bringing in the smiting, which in act took place on the cross, over the whole period from the supper.<a name=441:155></a> This might have been explained (it is at the end of my tract), but for fair minds is no ground of difficulty or objection.<a name=441:156></a> Scripture does so fully, "All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, Smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.<a name=441:157></a>" They were scattered before the time of smiting was there.<a name=441:158></a> "But now," He said unto them, "he that hath a purse let him take it.<a name=441:159></a>" And the Lord's discourse in John, "Now is the Son of man glorified.<a name=441:160></a>" The whole tenor of the gospel is thus to take the smiting as come -- the scene, as the scene of smiting.<a name=441:161></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#441:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>"I suppose that you would regard the sufferings of Christ in Gethsemane when anticipating the cup, as being different from the two kinds of suffering spoken of in the Epistles: but still I do not see that this opens the door for the admission of a third character of sufferings which are not atoning sufferings, nor suffering for righteousness sake, such as Christians may have to say to, but suffering and distress *under the government of God*. Now that Christ in the garden passed through the deepest distress in anticipation of the cup He had to drink for Israel's sake, as well as for ours, is blessedly true; but that He suffered thus as being in the position of the remnant, and passing through their exercises -- Satan using death as darkness and sorrow and terror with God's judgment sanctioning the pressure of it on the soul -- appears to me as contrary to scripture as it is to other parts of your tract, and to your teaching elsewhere?"

		Dear J E Batten, -- Many have by patiently inquiring found the solution to the difficulties which others have raised in their minds, and got rid of what (partly I believe from human infirmity was the result of flying from Mr.<a name=448:1></a> N.<a name=448:2></a>'s blasphemies, partly from want of entering in heart into the sorrows of the blessed Lord) I believe was a fatal practical denial of the true sufferings of the blessed Lord.<a name=448:3></a> Where there has not been malice, the judgment pronounced on my doctrine has been the effect of a denial of what is essential to the true sufferings of Christ, and indeed (I quite admit without their being aware of it) a denial of the true humanity of Christ.<a name=448:4></a> And they are, after all, obliged to admit a third kind of sufferings.<a name=448:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		His suffering as a righteous witness for God in the congregation was not the same thing as His being sorrowful unto death, nor His sense of the cutting off of all the present promises of beloved Israel through their sins, in His own cutting off.<a name=448:6></a> Nor was this sorrow atonement.<a name=448:7></a> The sorrowing at the rejection of the beloved people through their sins, and the scattering even of the sheep, which made Him withal weep over Jerusalem, and which was accomplished in the smiting and cutting off of Messiah in shortening His days, cutting Him off in the midst of His days, was real sorrow, as the sense of death was real sorrow -- "sorrowful even unto death.<a name=448:8></a>" As to Israel, it was occasioned by their sins, the judgment of God on them as a nation.<a name=448:9></a> But this, though the cross was the central point of it, was not in itself atonement.<a name=448:10></a> The cup of God's wrath, the infinite going out of a holy nature, of eternal judgment against sin itself, was behind all this, so to speak -- a thing of infinite depth.<a name=448:11></a> From the cutting off of Israel, though for their sins, and having received at the hand of the Lord double for all their sins (a thing impossible to be said of sin as an object of atonement), they, by atonement, can and will be restored.<a name=448:12></a> From the true final judgment of sin we cannot be restored.<a name=448:13></a> Now Christ suffered in this cutting off, in this depth of Israel's woes; He suffered in having His soul sorrowful even unto death itself, when confessedly He was not drinking the cup, but praying that He might not.<a name=448:14></a> He suffered Himself, not atoningly for others, though, as I have said, it led on to atonement.<a name=448:15></a> The dark shadow of this cutting off was on all that hour, and the sheep were scattered before the blow was outwardly struck: was their scattering the effect of atonement?<a name=448:16></a> or their scattering as the Jewish gathered sheep by the fact of the Shepherd being cut off?<a name=448:17></a> Was it the same thing as, "I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men unto me"?<a name=448:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now quite admitting that expressions may be obscure in the first statements of these subjects (but which were explained in the latter part), all this is stated in the tract.<a name=448:19></a> And I am satisfied that the loss of the sense of these sufferings of Christ is irreparable loss for those who suffer themselves to be deprived of them.<a name=448:20></a> If through their confidence in themselves, or listening to others, they suffer themselves to be left behind in going on towards Christ and learning what He is, the sorrow may be ours, the loss will be theirs.<a name=448:21></a> The difficulty was plain -- page 35 ["Collected Writings," vol.<a name=448:22></a> 7 page 304].<a name=448:23></a> It arose through Mr.<a name=448:24></a> N.<a name=448:25></a>'s doctrine bringing forward questions as to Christ's position, and the study of the Psalms consequent upon it.<a name=448:26></a> In my answer to him (the answer referred to as my <i>excluding</i> a third kind of sufferings), the whole subject is largely gone into -- nearly half the tract -- and in some passages with language more open to remark than in "The Sufferings," though not <i>called</i> a <i>third</i> kind.<a name=448:27></a> But it is totally impossible that those who have cited this expression could have read the tract.<a name=448:28></a> Certainly, when it said, "Messiah shall be cut off and have nothing," it was more than man's persecutions.<a name=448:29></a> When His soul was exceeding sorrowful, even unto death, it was more than man's persecution; yet it was not the drinking the cup of atonement, though, as I have largely insisted, He was meeting this also in spirit.<a name=448:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have felt the difficulty in Psalm 69, and deeply, but submitting to it at any rate as the word of God, and not reasoning against it to save an atonement not fully received in its true character.<a name=448:31></a> I had sufficient sense of that atonement as forsaking of God for sin, this dreadful cup of wrath standing wholly and absolutely alone in its nature, not to have it touched or shaken by any other sorrows I might learn of the blessed Lord, and in my feeble measure enter into.<a name=448:32></a> These were the two main points which helped to bring me into light as regards the difficulty: such a sense of sin as gave atonement its reality -- that I believe to be the grand secret; and such a submission to the word as received its authority and accepted it implicitly, waiting for God to teach.<a name=448:33></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think the sense of atonement (not the believing it made peace for themselves, though that may be weak) fails in its measure in those who object; and consequently they are afraid to look at true sorrows as a man, and as a Messiah, which are not that, though they led up to it.<a name=448:34></a> The only thing I dread sometimes is, not the separating these sorrows, but the mixing them too much.<a name=448:35></a> They <i>were</i> mixed, because as looking to be cut off He was looking to the cup of wrath too.<a name=448:36></a> Refer to pages 64-67 ["Collected Writings," vol.<a name=448:37></a> 7 pages 347-363], where this point is gone into.<a name=448:38></a> Compare pages 46, 47 ["Collected Writings," vol.<a name=448:39></a> 7 pages 321-323], though there is another point also there.<a name=448:40></a> Were all Christ's sufferings bearing iniquity, His soul being made an offering for sin?<a name=448:41></a> Was all beside this the simple fruit of suffering for a testimony to His Father (Jehovah) such as He passed through during His whole ministry, or was there a different kind of sorrow (often anticipated) when His hour was come?<a name=448:42></a> If so, what was it?<a name=448:43></a> Answer this, and feel sufficiently (though indeed who can do that?<a name=448:44></a>), and you will get out of the difficulty.<a name=448:45></a> Only, if you cannot explain it, hold fast the truth of the atonement on the cross; be assured that scripture is right, and wait for God's teaching.<a name=448:46></a>

		Dear C McAdam, -- We have had our meeting at Guelph.<a name=451:21></a> The heat was excessive, which I mention because on the one hand it was a little depressing to all, and on the other hand proved the interest, for there was no sleepiness.<a name=451:22></a> It was not a meeting of so much intimate communion, and so far not so much enjoyment, but this was caused by a great many fresh brethren from all parts of the United States, and some not in communion from Canada, so that it was more communication of truth, and, I believe, more useful, if not more enjoyment.<a name=451:23></a> We had, however, great liberty and happiness together, and it shewed the progress of truth, and will, with the Lord's blessing, be the means of spreading it.<a name=451:24></a> We had from eastern States and from western, and even one from Georgia .<a name=451:25></a>.<a name=451:26></a>.<a name=451:27></a> .<a name=451:28></a>

		All this exercised me in prayer, examination of my statements, and examination of the scriptures.<a name=451:52></a> As far as I can trust myself, I examined it thoroughly, without the smallest desire or thought of saving myself: Christ's glory, which was professedly in question, made that quite immaterial.<a name=451:53></a> One of my accusers was too dark as to the whole question to let his statements have much result, as such, in my mind; the effect in another was such as to destroy its weight, but this did not hinder my examining it, because Christ was in question.<a name=451:54></a> But my mind having been directed to other subjects, as I said, at Guelph, on my return here I again looked over my papers on "The Sufferings," and on the Psalms.<a name=451:55></a> The result is complete relief to my mind.<a name=451:56></a> I find one or two phrases to which I might add a clearing word, which are, however, fully cleared up in other passages destined to that.<a name=451:57></a> But I am satisfied that there is nothing wrong, but, on the contrary, edification in the statements, <i>where souls are able to enter into it</i>.<a name=451:58></a> I have no wish to bring souls, weak in the faith, to doubtful disputations.<a name=451:59></a> But it is clear to me that those who have objected are either ignorant or mischievously defective as to the sufferings of the blessed Lord; that it is the darkness of error on this point in their minds -- not the light of God, and error in me.<a name=451:60></a>

		[W Kelly] DEAREST BROTHER, -- I cannot at the moment go through the whole structure of Mark, which with time I may do.<a name=454:1></a> He seems, too, to have rather collected the facts as to the sabbath in this place.<a name=454:2></a> (Chapters 2, 3.<a name=454:3></a>) If so, absolute historical order would be too strong.<a name=454:4></a> But I do not judge that the case of Jairus is immediate on the feast.<a name=454:5></a> (Compare Mark 2: 15, 22; 5: 22; with Matthew 9: 10-17 and verse 18.<a name=454:6></a>) Two facts not at the feast seem to come in with ijdovnte" (Matthew 9: 11) -- not "when" as in English -- the Pharisees' remarks on His going there, and John's disciples who were fasting asking as to it.<a name=454:7></a> With this last Jairus comes in, tau'ta aujtou' lalou'nto" (Matthew 9: 18).<a name=454:8></a> The tovte (verse 14) cannot be taken, if it be so, as an immediate note of time.<a name=454:9></a> There is another apparent difficulty in Matthew 9: 1.<a name=454:10></a> But from the other Gospels, that connection is not immediate.<a name=454:11></a> The distance in Mark is mainly filled up with the mission of disciples and parables, not events.<a name=454:12></a> But the difference is important because the Gadarene events come after the parabolic break in His history.<a name=454:13></a> It is this which would be thus mainly out of its place in Matthew.<a name=454:14></a> Here, Mark 4: 35 -- uncertain as Luke's expression is -- shews the visit to Gadara was after the parables, and the same day.<a name=454:15></a> With time I may review the subject.<a name=454:16></a>

		It was my own feeling led me to write to you, not H.<a name=454:24></a> and D.<a name=454:25></a> I am not the least uneasy as to myself or as to doctrine.<a name=454:26></a> I mourn over these two brethren -- that is all.<a name=454:27></a> But I am anxious that the brethren's testimony should rest on its own bottom -- the unity of the church of God -- and not involve weak ones in disputations that would trouble them, but leave them all united on a common divine ground, not at all on my teaching.<a name=454:28></a> Satan would seek to give a character in this way.<a name=454:29></a> Hence it was I proposed leaving them out, not as not owning their position, but discharging them from my conflicts.<a name=454:30></a> I am not the least afraid as to my doctrine, or the conflict, if there is to be any; but I do not want to burthen others.<a name=454:31></a> I go on with my work here just as before.<a name=454:32></a> If I am thrown into conflict when arriving in England, in waiting quietly on God, He will not fail to help me.<a name=454:33></a> Mere attacks I should take no notice of whatever.<a name=454:34></a> I have a much better place in doing work than in decrying others.<a name=454:35></a> I think of the brethren, not of myself, that they may be kept in unity on true divine ground as the testimony of God, as I believe they are.<a name=454:36></a> I should deplore as ruinous, slipping into the place of followers of a system of doctrine.<a name=454:37></a> D.<a name=454:38></a> and H.<a name=454:39></a> have not produced that effect.<a name=454:40></a> God has been gracious in this.<a name=454:41></a> It is an attack on me.<a name=454:42></a> Be it so.<a name=454:43></a> I am sorry for, but used to, it.<a name=454:44></a> On the other hand, their giving up sound doctrine and getting on such ground as H.<a name=454:45></a>'s mind was on, or giving doctrine formally up for peace, would be their ruin.<a name=454:46></a> They would go much farther back.<a name=454:47></a> All I seek is that they should be on their own quiet, solid ground.<a name=454:48></a> If battle there must be, I can take up the cudgels without involving them; if none, so much the better; if only decrying my doctrine, etc.<a name=454:49></a>, there need not be any.<a name=454:50></a> I am happily uninformed of all that passes.<a name=454:51></a> The brethren, I believe, intentionally and very kindly leave me to my work.<a name=454:52></a>

		As to the question (Luke 22: 53): I think the Lord speaks generally; the actual accomplishment was when delivered.<a name=454:53></a> But it was seen, so to speak, in the Lord's mind from the supper; and He contemplates it as a present thing from Judas' going out.<a name=454:54></a> No doubt Gethsemane must have been gone through before it actually came, but the devil had put it in Judas's heart, and had entered into him -- the counsel was taken.<a name=454:55></a> And the Lord held it all practically to be then come.<a name=454:56></a> "Your hour" is the time in which the priests and scribes were allowed to have their way under the influence of Satan.<a name=454:57></a>

		[G Alexander] BELOVED BROTHER, -- Thank you for your letter.<a name=457:1></a> I have heard nothing.<a name=457:2></a> I thought the brethren had kept silence on purpose, as I received no letters; but it may be otherwise, as some forwarded to me in Illinois have never reached me.<a name=457:3></a> I am sure, as you say, all is appointed by the hand of a good and gracious God.<a name=457:4></a> I felt this attack because of those engaged in it.<a name=457:5></a> I suppose it was good to learn that we are not to rely on any human tie or affection.<a name=457:6></a> It was painful that whilst I was labouring and toiling, humanly speaking, at all cost to myself, those I should, naturally speaking, have relied on, are labouring to destroy my labour and ministry, without saying a word to me about it.<a name=457:7></a> The case soon became plain to me; but I am quite peaceful about it now.<a name=457:8></a> I never doubted it was the work of the enemy, and cast it entirely on the Lord, and prayed earnestly the brethren might be kept in peace, and He has thus far answered my prayer.<a name=457:9></a> I have never been the least anxious as to myself or my doctrine.<a name=457:10></a> I have kept quiet as the best path, save answering inquiries from those exercised about it; but I have known none but such as were stirred up by others.<a name=457:11></a> The Lord will judge the matter and the motives of all, and in His hand I leave it.<a name=457:12></a> Had I defended myself, it would have tended to make it a party matter, to make the brethren stand on a system of doctrine, not quietly (independently of individuals) on the unity of the body: and a great body of brethren were too little versed in and informed on the subject not to have suffered by a discussion; and the holiest subjects would have been desecrated in their minds.<a name=457:13></a> They needed to weigh quietly and learn what divine teaching on the subject was.<a name=457:14></a> I therefore answered inquiries and kept quietly at my ordinary work, having thoroughly re-examined the statements to see if false doctrine was really there.<a name=457:15></a> Probably I shall never read D.<a name=457:16></a>'s book.<a name=457:17></a> My statements have been out these four or five years (query, eight years?<a name=457:18></a>), so that controversy will add nothing probably to edification.<a name=457:19></a> I may correct expressions if I publish a new edition.<a name=457:20></a> I can heartily give God thanks for it all, and we have always something to learn and judge in making a return on ourselves before God.<a name=457:21></a>

		[C Wolston] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- It is a long time since you wrote, but I have been in journeys on wagons and cars through south Illinois, besides some 1,800 miles of rail, and labour in the word wherever I went, nor was I disposed to answer anything on the subject of your quotation from -- 's letter.<a name=458:1></a> I have preferred going on with my work and leaving these attacks to God, and such is pretty much my purpose .<a name=458:2></a>.<a name=458:3></a>.<a name=458:4></a> .<a name=458:5></a> Since I returned I read the papers through, not in respect of passages objected to, but to see the doctrine of the papers as a whole; the result has been even to myself deep edification, and such, I am persuaded, they may be to those who seek it.<a name=458:6></a> There are three passages (I think) where I should change a word, to take away the opportunity from those who seek it, of troubling simple souls; and there are parts into which those who are not spiritually minded will not (I dare say) enter, but the instruction I believe to be most true and profitable.<a name=458:7></a> I am, of course, sorry if any who cannot estimate it should be cast aside, but I must leave that to the Lord, humbling and searching myself as to how far I may have given occasion, but persuaded that for those who seek the truth, the papers, as they at once or gradually enter into them, are most timely and profitable.<a name=458:8></a> I am content if the heart rightly receive the sufferings of Christ, and the atonement be clearly held; but for those who can occupy themselves with the ways of God and the perfect love of Christ, the view of these papers will much deepen the sense of the Lord's sorrows, and intelligence of what those sorrows were, and I know not what greater gain there can be.<a name=458:9></a> Strange to say, though a page or two may require spiritual apprehension to see its bearing, there is nothing I have looked over of my own which has interested me so much, nor, I think, from which I have received so much edification.<a name=458:10></a> Nor indeed do I see any difficulty for those for whom it has not been sought or made.<a name=458:11></a> But of this I will not speak .<a name=458:12></a>.<a name=458:13></a>.<a name=458:14></a> .<a name=458:15></a>

		[W Pickard] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I thank you for your note and its enclosures.<a name=463:1></a> I am still going on, through mercy, with my work, helped and happy in it.<a name=463:2></a> I have just been to Quebec and to the eastern townships, and am soon on my way (D.<a name=463:3></a>V.<a name=463:4></a>) to New York; I suppose this week.<a name=463:5></a> I have seen none of the attacks on my tracts, nor have I sought to see them, as I know the objections, and I look on them simply as an evil attack on myself, which I can freely leave to the Lord.<a name=463:6></a> Yesterday and today I have heard they are in Canada, and I leave them in Canada to their readers as I do in England, and have not sought to see them .<a name=463:7></a>.<a name=463:8></a>.<a name=463:9></a> .<a name=463:10></a> As to the substance of the matter, I am perfectly satisfied that my adversaries and not myself are in the wrong.<a name=463:11></a> The case seems to me so sad a one on their part, that I am glad to be silent, and leave it to God.<a name=463:12></a> What may be needed to relieve brethren's minds I will do, but defend myself I am fully settled not to do.<a name=463:13></a> I believe that to every willing mind my statements are blessed and edifying, some parts I suppose difficult to be entered into by an unexercised mind.<a name=463:14></a> I believe the acceptance of their views would be partly error, partly a fatal principle (which is really N.<a name=463:15></a>'s), or I would have withdrawn my papers for the sake even of those two brethren and peace; but I believe it would have been the acceptance of dishonour done to Christ, once the question was raised.<a name=463:16></a> I have a much more decided judgment than brethren are aware of in the matter, but waited clearness as to the Lord's judgment on how I should deal with the matter, as it might have been leading the weak to doubtful disputations .<a name=463:17></a>.<a name=463:18></a>.<a name=463:19></a> .<a name=463:20></a> That only was what I feared might have been the evil of my original papers.<a name=463:21></a> When you print it is for all necessarily, but so far am I from thinking there is error in what I meant, that if I could I would have that truth with brethren, if not, without them.<a name=463:22></a> I may wait anxiously to see the right way of dealing with the attacks, or the anxiety of the brethren, or judge myself as to the opportuneness of the original publication; but the truth as to the Lord's sufferings I am not going to give up, nor what will edify me; in adoringly inquiring into them, I have gained immensely, and what I am not going to give up .<a name=463:23></a>.<a name=463:24></a>.<a name=463:25></a> .<a name=463:26></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		My question is how to deal with the case for the good of brethren and before God.<a name=463:27></a> It is possible we needed humbling from the blessing we had received.<a name=463:28></a> It may be that the going out was necessary, that it might be made manifest that they were not all of us.<a name=463:29></a> It is sad, but God has never allowed what was contradictory to principle, or evil, to remain concealed among brethren, though He has dealt most tenderly and graciously with us.<a name=463:30></a> I have no doubt He will secure His own testimony, though if we have got out of a low place He may put us into it.<a name=463:31></a> We may have Bochim because we have not Gilgal.<a name=463:32></a> I am anxious at any rate not to get out of the place of meekness, and to take Abigail's advice, and in nothing to avenge myself.<a name=463:33></a> Patience must have its perfect work.<a name=463:34></a> The effort of Satan is much more to swamp godly exclusion of connivance at evil doctrine, than anything as to evil doctrine itself; but here there is a principle which will only be so much the dearer to godly brethren.<a name=463:35></a> The Lord watches over His church: "Rejoice not against me, oh my enemy," etc.<a name=463:36></a> I expect, of course, the diligent circulation of attacks by those without .<a name=463:37></a>.<a name=463:38></a>.<a name=463:39></a> .<a name=463:40></a> But as we say in French, "<i>L'ennemi fait une uvre qui le trompe</i>.<a name=463:41></a>"

		J B Stoney, Thank you much for your account of Ireland, which I was very glad to receive.<a name=467:1></a> I have no doubt, nor indeed ever had, that souls simply seeking edification on the sufferings would find blessing in the paper on the "Sufferings.<a name=467:2></a>" I dread only too great dissecting and explaining them: the truth is, the added explanations clear up everything; still, it is all right to meet any minds who have difficulties.<a name=467:3></a> I am thankful, too, that in the main the brethren have stood in the pressure that came.<a name=467:4></a> I think it will have been a certain crisis for them, and that it will be a strengthening of their conscious position.<a name=467:5></a> I do not think they are wholly through it, but pretty near .<a name=467:6></a>.<a name=467:7></a>.<a name=467:8></a> .<a name=467:9></a>

		[R T Grant] BELOVED BROTHER, -- I accept your statements quite, as far as I see.<a name=469:1></a> Meddling metaphysically with the Lord's Person is beyond our power, and only does us harm.<a name=469:2></a> But we are right in seeing what the sense of cwri;" aJmartiva" in Hebrews 4 is; and I have never doubted for many a long day (and have so translated it, if I remember aright) that it means "sin apart," namely -- He was not tempted by sin as we are.<a name=469:3></a> So long ago as Irvingism I took this ground on it against them.<a name=469:4></a> In taking scripture thus simply without pursuing it further metaphysically at all, the soul gets a resting-place.<a name=469:5></a> I know that that blessed One had no sin in His human nature as I have, and it is a comfort and a rest to me.<a name=469:6></a> I know there is, and know a sinless humanity, and that is a relief to my spirit.<a name=469:7></a> But then as a saint I am tempted, not by sin within merely, but by attractions and distress from without.<a name=469:8></a> In <i>me</i> it is often mixed up with combat with the flesh within; but then I blame myself that I let it thus be alive, and I may not in such case always draw the fine thread of God's word between the two.<a name=469:9></a> In Christ the temptations were there -- all the kingdoms of the world, and the distress of death.<a name=469:10></a> One met repulsion, as taking it from Satan; the other, perfect submission, which was what was needed.<a name=469:11></a> It was perfectness -- not a moment's acquiescence.<a name=469:12></a> In one, Satan sought to introduce lust as he did in Eve, in the other to turn away from the path of painful obedience.<a name=469:13></a> Blessed be God, in both it was only triumph over him, and more than the mere absence of evil, though that was there.<a name=469:14></a> But if we, being saints, shrink (I do not say feel it) from trial, or feel attracted in will or lust by temptation from without, we have to recognise the still practically living flesh, which we have a right to hold as dead, not because we are as Christ was alive, but because He has died: He had to be able to die sinless, and <i>to</i> sin -- we, to hold ourselves to be dead thereby to it.<a name=469:15></a> Hence, we are not called upon to be what Christ was, but "to walk even as he walked;" while we can say as before God, "as he <i>is</i> so are we in this world.<a name=469:16></a>" Though of course ripening in it (as it is our privilege to do), all that ground I had to go over in scripture in Mr.<a name=469:17></a> Irving's time, some four-and-thirty years ago, and have never had any difficulty -- except, alas, in making it good -- since.<a name=469:18></a> We are, thank God, as He is, through grace, <i>in this world</i>.<a name=469:19></a> It seems paradoxical to say we are as He is in glory, and cannot say we are as He was in humiliation; but it is easy to solve for the believer: I quite agree with what you say.<a name=469:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I sympathise with dear -- , but we must expect these trials.<a name=469:21></a> I would I were there to help him, unpleasant as it is; but we must never expect conscience or delicacy with heretics.<a name=469:22></a> Our part is to trust the Lord, and be as firm in testimony as possible.<a name=469:23></a> I have always found gracious patience with mistakes the way, but when with God, treating Satan as Satan, when I saw it was so, by grace, he had no power.<a name=469:24></a> I have seen most striking cases of this.<a name=469:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here there is nothing new or flattering.<a name=469:26></a> The loose gathering is now in the hands of M.<a name=469:27></a>, and openly denies the immortality of the soul.<a name=469:28></a> It was preached there last Sunday.<a name=469:29></a> We are getting united, and to know each other, and there is a <i>little</i> individual testimony.<a name=469:30></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I think, were I staying here, I should gradually get among a few -- a very few I have.<a name=469:31></a> In general, money and churches satisfy them, but there are those who groan at the state of things.<a name=469:32></a> They are not a happy people, such is my impression, though I find them easy to live amongst.<a name=469:33></a>

		BELOVED BROTHER.<a name=470:2></a> -- Our brother B.<a name=470:3></a> has written to me, and has told me that you are thinking, I will not say intending, to leave the society, and to labour in the Lord's work independently, and to walk by faith in the Lord's path, and to get for yourself a business occupation, so as to provide for the necessities of life down here.<a name=470:4></a> If I had had your address I would have written to you direct, but I had not it here in America.<a name=470:5></a> We spoke together a little on this subject at the railway station at Milan, and now I am going to speak to you again on this point by means of a letter.<a name=470:6></a> I do not believe that a servant of God, sent by the Lord Himself to work in His field, ought to be the servant of men, but free from all to follow the guidance of the Holy Ghost.<a name=470:7></a> But if he works faithfully, being really called by the Lord, and walks humbly and blamelessly in the ways of the Lord, I believe that brethren are under an obligation to support him, an obligation of christian love, and a real privilege of Christians; thus they are helpers of the gospel itself.<a name=470:8></a> Thus the faith of the servant is exercised; he depends immediately on the Lord, and is entirely free to follow out the will of the Holy Ghost and to follow His guidance.<a name=470:9></a> On the other hand, if he walk badly, brethren are also free to keep the Lord's money which has been entrusted to them.<a name=470:10></a> As to brotherly love, it is exercised without suggestion, likewise all gifts.<a name=470:11></a> Without doubt, for such a life, faith is needed, and that is the only difficulty.<a name=470:12></a> Brethren cannot promise help; it would not be faith; also money or love might fail; but the Lord, who is ever faithful, cannot fail us.<a name=470:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to an occupation, it is a question of circumstances.<a name=470:14></a> If the gift of the Lord's servant is not sufficient to occupy his whole time, he does well to work in order to gain a livelihood.<a name=470:15></a> But if God has called him to labour in His work, and especially if he is an evangelist, then business is an obstacle to his service, and hinders him from following the Lord's call, and from fulfilling what the Lord has called him to do.<a name=470:16></a> These are my thoughts, dearest brother, as to the Lord's labourer.<a name=470:17></a> We need to take counsel with the Lord in order to know if He has called us: faith is needed to enable us to follow His voice; but He is faithful in enlightening our minds, and giving us the strength needed to walk according to His will.<a name=470:18></a> I have seen it thus after forty years, and more, that He is faithful and never fails us; He never has failed.<a name=470:19></a> I know that brethren are disposed to do all they can while you and other brothers labour faithfully in the Lord's field according to the truth of the gospel, and to leave you free in your work.<a name=470:20></a> I believe in the faithfulness of the Lord; man can neither do anything, nor promise anything, if the Lord does not give him strength for it.<a name=470:21></a> But I know that the path of faith is the path of peace and of joy.<a name=470:22></a> I hope to get news of you.<a name=470:23></a>

		MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I had little difficulty as to -- 's letter, but on a scriptural word or phrase I never like to answer with out examining it thoroughly; one often learns oneself a good deal.<a name=472:1></a> As regards the use of reconciling the Father to us, it is quite evident that it cannot <i>there</i><a href="#472:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> have the meaning of bringing back into favour, or it would be bringing back the Father into our favour, which is clearly not what the article means.<a name=472:2></a> Though in a <i>certain sense</i>, this is nearer the scriptural truth, absurd as it is when so stated; because God has wrought in perfect grace to win our confidence to Him, and so far to be in our good favour.<a name=472:3></a> The simple expression, baldly given, would of course be absurd and shocking, and I refer to it here to shew that, in the article, it is impossible to use it in the sense Mr.<a name=472:4></a> -- would give to the word.<a name=472:5></a> His argument goes to another point: that the use of it in scripture as regards us, for it is confessedly never used of God expressly, is equivalent doctrinally to the use of it in the article as regards the Father.<a name=472:6></a> But this is a mistake, and begging the question.<a name=472:7></a> Reconciled means, he says, restored to favour: supposing it were so, it does not follow therefore that restoring us to favour was by changing God's feeling towards us.<a name=472:8></a> Reconciling does suppose hostility, as we see in scripture in ejcqrov", "when we were enemies we were reconciled" -- "alienated and enemies in our minds by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled.<a name=472:9></a>" This leaves no doubt as to the meaning of ejcqrov" or katallavssw.<a name=472:10></a> God is unchangeable in His nature and estimate of good and evil, and when we turn through grace, or the precious word of Christ is presented, that same righteous and perfect estimate does necessarily favour us.<a name=472:11></a> He is angry, and His anger is turned away: He is righteous and just to forgive.<a name=472:12></a> Hence "propitiate" is a true word, and God forbid it should be changed by any Socinian enfeebling of its force.<a name=472:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The nearest verbal justification to be had is "to make reconciliation for the sins of the people;" but there it is iJJlavskesqai "to make propitiation:" so Christ is an iJlasmov" and an iJlasthvrio".<a name=472:14></a> This is fundamental truth, and it is just because reconciling takes it off this ground, and puts it as if God was against us and Christ for us, so as to turn Him, that the expression is mischievous.<a name=472:15></a> And I do not think the Reformers were wholly clear of this, at any rate, in the liturgical part of their system.<a name=472:16></a> It is just the Popish view of the matter: only with them Christ has to be turned too, and Mary is the gracious person -- 'that God retained justice unto Himself and granted mercy to her': 'He (Christ) finds Himself in the same disposition with the Father towards sinners, namely, to reject them; so that the difficulty is to induce Him to exchange the office of a judge for that of a supplicant': so Mary 'appeases the wrath of her Son.<a name=472:17></a>'
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All this gives a false idea of God, even where Mary has nothing to say to it.<a name=472:18></a> The sense of unchangeable holiness cannot be too strong, so that propitiation is needed; but what weakens the sense of love in God Himself, as the source and spring of all, destroys the nature of Christianity.<a name=472:19></a> The Son of man <i>must</i> be lifted up, but God so loved that He <i>gave</i> His only-begotten Son.<a name=472:20></a> Now I must say that the article does not give this aspect to Christianity; nor am I aware of any that does, so as to correct the impression which it leaves.<a name=472:21></a> If I were to say you had done everything to reconcile your father to me, certainly I should not think that his love was the source of it all.<a name=472:22></a> Reconciling does suppose entering into good graces, where it is mutual, but that is properly diallavssw, as in Matthew 5: 24.<a name=472:23></a> And even in 2 Corinthians 5: 18, the mind thinks of the world entering into favour with God, but by the activity of God's love, not by His being reconciled; and the work wrought is wrought, or sought to be wrought, in the world's mind, not in the mind of God: God <i>was doing it</i>.<a name=472:24></a> It was not done in Him, though the effect might be His favour.<a name=472:25></a> Katallavssw is to change, even as money; and the change was to be wrought not in God's state but in the world's, though it might be true it is implied that His favour would thereon flow out.<a name=472:26></a> But reconciling <i>Him</i> is quite another thing.<a name=472:27></a> From man's nature we suppose hostility <i>to</i> an enemy, and favour to return on their being reconciled, particularly the last when there is authority.<a name=472:28></a> And so far Mr.<a name=472:29></a> -- is right.<a name=472:30></a> But to apply this to God is just the evil.<a name=472:31></a> <i>Hostis</i> in Latin originally only meant a stranger, Cicero I think tells us.<a name=472:32></a> There is not a trace of such a meaning of ejcqrov" as -- suggests<a href="#472:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a> in the New Testament.<a name=472:33></a>

		Dear G V Wigram, -- Though I sent you a paper for the Present Testimony, I am not disposed to send any for publication in brethren's publications till all these questions on the Sufferings are over; but wait till I am, if God will, returned to England, when I can act on my own responsibility.<a name=474:1></a> I have today received for the first time the attacks against me, sent by I know not whom -- not the authors .<a name=474:2></a>.<a name=474:3></a>.<a name=474:4></a> .<a name=474:5></a> I have not occupied myself with them.<a name=474:6></a> I allude to papers here, because a good deal of additional materials have been brought out in my mind in studying scripture here .<a name=474:7></a>.<a name=474:8></a>.<a name=474:9></a> .<a name=474:10></a> I have sent the matter for the new edition of the tract "On the Sufferings;" a thing I have no satisfaction in; but as brethren wished it, I have done it.<a name=474:11></a> My own present feeling is that it is a great mercy these matters came out.<a name=474:12></a> I am satisfied that my adversaries are thoroughly unsound as to the sufferings of Christ.<a name=474:13></a> I fear for them.<a name=474:14></a> I would not hold their views for any consideration.<a name=474:15></a> But I take no steps of any kind while here, nor leave my work because of it.<a name=474:16></a> In these last days nothing but what is material for the church will make me act; and the brethren's testimony rests on other ground: but were I alone, I should rest alone with the truth I have sought to put out there.<a name=474:17></a> The ground taken against me, as far as I have known it, makes me immovable in rejecting their views, and holding the substance of mine.<a name=474:18></a> I trouble myself little about petty objections.<a name=474:19></a> There is a grave question for me, but it has been raised in my mind by their statements, not by my own.<a name=474:20></a> I am a little surprised brethren have not seen it.<a name=474:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the work here I have not much to recount.<a name=474:22></a> In a large town it is a work of patience and detail, but though patience be exercised, I have felt encouraged.<a name=474:23></a> The brethren whose deliverance I had sought are now with us, and getting to know those here, and confidence growing.<a name=474:24></a> The testimony stands wholly clear, and in contrast with prevalent heresies (annihilation) as a rejected thing, and the ground of insisting on the truth openly taken.<a name=474:25></a> Two who were not prepared to take it remain outside -- one a great deliverance.<a name=474:26></a> In this country one great obstacle was that those who held the Lord's coming and other truths, were -- or bore with annihilation and Newtonism.<a name=474:27></a> All this is now clear, and at least the foundation is laid of holding these truths apart from systems, and sound doctrine insisted on more than anywhere else.<a name=474:28></a> We have gathered up a few more stray souls, and with occasional testimony outside; that is the sum of our work .<a name=474:29></a>.<a name=474:30></a>.<a name=474:31></a> .<a name=474:32></a> An audience as yet we have none, yet the truth has been spread, and souls have found peace, and know the gospel is there as it is not elsewhere.<a name=474:33></a> The rest our God must open the way to.<a name=474:34></a> I dare say that staying here I should gradually get to know people and spread the truth, but that is hardly my place.<a name=474:35></a> There is more apparent open door at Boston, but I was anxious to get what was scattered, or not gathered, a little solidly together here before I left.<a name=474:36></a> Some I looked to take part and who would have been a comfort and help are elsewhere -- one dear man in heaven; then others form a little nucleus where they are gone: some I have still to look after.<a name=474:37></a> People know not how many who have left England or Ireland in communion are scattered in the world here.<a name=474:38></a> It will be a resource to many, in such a centre as this, to have a place where they can commune in peace when they come.<a name=474:39></a>

		I have much time here, as few can be seen till after business hours.<a name=474:41></a> Besides reading, I have set myself with some zeal to grammatical Hebrew.<a name=474:42></a> One can profit by everything, but Hebrew points and their changes are not exactly my line of things; but constant interruptions had made me very far back in any accuracy.<a name=474:43></a> I used it, but with a vague and uncertain knowledge, or next to none.<a name=474:44></a> Courage and patience will do everything but give love; that the soul must have with and from God.<a name=474:45></a> That is what I want most.<a name=474:46></a>

		[F G Patterson] DEAREST BROTHER, -- I am most thankful that you have resigned your place.<a name=476:1></a> I could never have hesitated a moment as to what I could have desired, but you cannot press another beyond his own faith.<a name=476:2></a> But there is a gracious and faithful Lord who cares for us, and will never leave us nor forsake us.<a name=476:3></a> I suppose you have little, humanly speaking, to depend on.<a name=476:4></a> So best -- I say, so best.<a name=476:5></a> It is the highest place, if through grace we have faith to walk in it.<a name=476:6></a> And I will answer for the Lord, that though He may let your faith be tried, He will meet and bless it.<a name=476:7></a> I am sure there is plenty to do, and it is, as ever, labourers that are wanting.<a name=476:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"Nots" are dangerous things in scriptural subjects, because the Holy Ghost teaches by <i>positive</i> truth, and we must know every case to use an exclusive not.<a name=476:9></a> The object of Ephesians 1 and Romans 8 is I think clearly to shew <i>what</i> we are predestinated to, but when it says predestinated us, it is hard to say it does not refer to persons: "Whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate.<a name=476:10></a>" Now this shews that in the main the object was to teach what they were predestinated to, but then it is affirmed of the persons whom He foreknew, that is a distinct class of persons so foreknown -- not, predestinated those whom He foreknew would be conformed (which was the Arminian scheme); but those whom He foreknew He predestinated to be conformed.<a name=476:11></a> Election suppose a large number out of whom God chooses; and if we take it as eternal, or no time with God, still a number are in view out of whom a choice is made.<a name=476:12></a> Predestination is the proper purpose of God as to these individuals: even supposing there were no others, God had them in His mind -- surely for something, which is thus as we see connected with it; but it is a blessed idea that God had His mind thus set on us without thinking of others.<a name=476:13></a> "The good pleasure of his will" is connected with it, and if we ascribe it to grace that we are elect, that thought, though we stop in it, does suppose others.<a name=476:14></a> We are "elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father.<a name=476:15></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I accept then the positive part of what you say, but am afraid of "not.<a name=476:16></a>" I should not say a sheep is a sheep from all eternity, because the person did not exist; but I clearly hold he was a sheep before he was converted, for Christ says, "Other sheep I have which are not of this fold: them also I must bring;" and, "My sheep hear my voice," etc.<a name=476:17></a>; and, "Ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep.<a name=476:18></a>" No doubt He delights to look upon and lead them as such when called, but they are called such before.<a name=476:19></a> The main object of the apostle in both Ephesians and Romans are those that are members of the church, but the passages do not go into church privileges as such, but children's and brethren's place.<a name=476:20></a> Election properly is more in Ephesians 1: 4, and in verse 5 the peculiar place belonging to these; and in both, though the principle go beyond, the apostle is speaking actually only of <i>us</i>: not that I exclude others, but these were then occupying the apostle's mind.<a name=476:21></a> He is always practical.<a name=476:22></a> Romans 8: 28-30 does not say us.<a name=476:23></a> In verse 31 he begins with us: it is applied.<a name=476:24></a>

		It thus involves and supposes the persons as you say -- "not persons, but rather the state and conditions to which they are brought;" but then "they" are persons, and some special ones.<a name=476:25></a> Now in Ephesians he only <i>actually</i> speaks of "us": in Romans it is general .<a name=476:26></a>.<a name=476:27></a>.<a name=476:28></a> .<a name=476:29></a>

		[G Gausby] BELOVED BROTHER, -- Thank you for -- 's little account of Mrs.<a name=477:1></a> -- .<a name=477:2></a> All around her knew how she was valued and beloved by us all.<a name=477:3></a> But I feel as to her it was just a sheaf of corn fully ripe, so that it was natural -- so to speak, time for her to pass into rest; so that in this sense it is a happy feeling, and though the loss will surely be felt, this will be the soothing feeling of those who were more immediately her own.<a name=477:4></a> It is a happy thought that those we love are gone home where peace and rest are.<a name=477:5></a> I have sometimes thought that seeing so many as I have, my turn was nearly come -- fairly come, so to speak.<a name=477:6></a> But the present opposition to the truth makes me feel some what different.<a name=477:7></a> I am not disposed to leave the conflict in presence of this new work and dodge of the enemy, and do pity these men with my whole heart.<a name=477:8></a> To see them thrown into the arms of those they know were for years resisting the truth and testimony of God, and were helping on Satan against it.<a name=477:9></a> Oh, it is very dismal, and those who once helped it, and with whom I was associated.<a name=477:10></a> I am perfectly persuaded that Satan only has, and Christ not one particle, to say to the matter.<a name=477:11></a> I only search, anxiously submitting myself to God, what occasion I have given.<a name=477:12></a> My full persuasion is that the <i>occasion</i>, not the cause, was the publication of my writings.<a name=477:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have stated what you refer to in the introduction to the new edition.<a name=477:14></a> I purposely did not speak of it in writing privately .<a name=477:15></a>.<a name=477:16></a>.<a name=477:17></a> .<a name=477:18></a> I desired that brethren should have their minds exercised on the points (answering merely what they asked in my replies to them); and they were so frightened many of them that, in the presence of bitter adversaries whose conscience I could not reckon on for a moment, I felt I must wait, going on as God led me, not throwing them into their hands.<a name=477:19></a> Traditional expressions had such influence that one had to let them compare them with scripture for themselves as the questions gradually arose.<a name=477:20></a> Now I have put out my own statement, I have stated it clearly and simply.<a name=477:21></a> As far as possible, I did not desire to take it out of the sphere of edification nor raise questions which half the saints just as pious as others could not solve.<a name=477:22></a> In no objector have I seen the smallest trace of the working of the Spirit of God.<a name=477:23></a> In every case it is the sign, and characterised by a state of fall and the action of self, in some deplorably so.<a name=477:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But then I have to judge myself as furnishing any occasion to the outbreak.<a name=477:25></a> It will (I doubt not) turn to blessing; God is above it all, but it was a subtle and sad effort of Satan, and so sad, that those we had so known should have fallen into his hands.<a name=477:26></a> It shewed too, I think, an enfeebled state of things -- a reaction from N.<a name=477:27></a>'s work of evil.<a name=477:28></a> But I think it will do the brethren good.<a name=477:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I cannot find that smiting in scripture is ever used for atonement, though when smitten He wrought it.<a name=477:30></a> But it is clear to me that the sense of Christ's sufferings was lost among brethren through the dread of Mr.<a name=477:31></a> N.<a name=477:32></a>'s blasphemies.<a name=477:33></a> But my desire is that they may go on quietly with the profit of their souls, and not get into questions even when right.<a name=477:34></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I rejoice to hear of the blessing; here I find many souls so thankful to get plain truth, and full truth.<a name=477:35></a>

		[<i>From the French</i>.<a name=479:1></a>] BELOVED BROTHER, -- I received your little note, and was glad to hear from you.<a name=479:2></a> As to 1 Timothy 5, verses 24, 25 relate to verse 22.<a name=479:3></a> Timothy was not to lay hands hastily on any.<a name=479:4></a> In the case where the walk of one on whom hands had been laid should turn out badly, Timothy would, although involuntarily, be concerned in the evil, through placing the man in a position which had his sanction.<a name=479:5></a> This exhortation gives the apostle occasion to add, "Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment.<a name=479:6></a>" Manifest to every one, they proclaim beforehand, like heralds, the judgment which awaits those who commit them.<a name=479:7></a> The sins of other men were more hidden, but would, nevertheless, come into open day.<a name=479:8></a> It is the same with good works.<a name=479:9></a> Now the fact that sins might be hidden, was to make Timothy prudent in laying on of hands on persons who presented themselves to him with this object.<a name=479:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We see very clearly, in comparing together the two Epistles to Timothy, the difference between the order of the house of God, such as it had been established by the apostle, and the walk taught by the Spirit of God, when disorder had come in after Paul's decease.<a name=479:11></a> The first epistle presents to us the established order; the second, the walk requisite in the disorder, when the Lord alone knows them that are His -- a state of things very different from that in which "the Lord added to the assembly daily such as should be saved.<a name=479:12></a>" Then, the mighty action of the Spirit of God manifested His children, and set them in their place in the church.<a name=479:13></a> But, in the times of which the Second Epistle to Timothy speaks, "the Lord knoweth them that are his," there may be some hidden in systems not according to His will.<a name=479:14></a> Then the responsibility rests upon the individual: he is to depart from iniquity, to purge himself from the vessels to dishonour, and associate himself with those who call upon the name of the Lord out of a pure heart.<a name=479:15></a> It is here that we find our place, only remembering the unity of the body, and seeking to realise it.<a name=479:16></a> We have the character of a remnant in these last days, but of a remnant which recalls the first principles on which the church was founded at the beginning; a simple and happy path, but which demands faith, and the boldness that obedient faith supplies.<a name=479:17></a> May God give us, in His grace, to walk in it with a firm, peaceful yet decided step.<a name=479:18></a> If we look to Him, all is simple; we see our way clearly, and we have motives that do not leave the soul a prey to uncertainty.<a name=479:19></a> It is the double-minded man who is unstable in all his ways.<a name=479:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, that which is eternal becomes ever more real to us, and nearer.<a name=479:21></a> This is what gives strength, and excludes all the motives and influences which might mislead us.<a name=479:22></a> How happy we are to be under the guidance of the Lord, to have the heart filled with Him whose thoughts are eternal, and who is love, who has so loved us and given Himself for us; who gave Himself to God, as to His own perfection, but still to possess us -- blessed be His name -- and to have us with Him for ever.<a name=479:23></a> It is sweet to feel that He nourishes the church and cherishes it .<a name=479:24></a>.<a name=479:25></a>.<a name=479:26></a>

		[<i>To the same</i>.<a name=480:1></a>] [<i>From the French</i>.<a name=480:2></a>] -- - I do not know if, in my "tudes," I have sufficiently pointed out the structure of the Epistle to the Romans.<a name=480:3></a> At any rate, this point has very much developed in my mind.<a name=480:4></a> In chapter 1 I reach the close of the introduction at verse 17.<a name=480:5></a> Verse 18 begins the reasoning which proves the necessity of the gospel, by the sins, whether of Jews or Gentiles.<a name=480:6></a> From chapter 3: 21 we have the answer of grace in the blood of Christ, to the sins committed, the explanation of the patience of God with regard to past sins, and the foundation of righteousness revealed in this present time.<a name=480:7></a> Then, in chapter 4, resurrection, as an accomplished fact, is added.<a name=480:8></a> In chapter 5: 1-11 he shews all the blessings which flow from that which precedes; peace, favour, glory hereafter, joy in tribulation, joy in God Himself.<a name=480:9></a> This brings out the sovereign grace and love of God -- a love which He has shed abroad in our hearts by His Spirit which He has given us.<a name=480:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A leading division of the epistle is found at the end of verse 11, chapter 5.<a name=480:11></a> Up to the end of this verse the apostle has spoken of <i>sins</i>, then of grace.<a name=480:12></a> Now he begins to speak of <i>sin</i>.<a name=480:13></a> Before, it was our offences; now it is a disobedience of one only: it is Adam (each no doubt having added his part) and Christ.<a name=480:14></a> Consequently, it is no longer Christ dead for our sins, but <i>we</i> dead in Christ, which puts an end to the nature and standing which we had by Adam.<a name=480:15></a> This is also why the apostle speaks of our death, and hardly goes beyond it.<a name=480:16></a> If he had spoken of our resurrection with Christ, he would have encroached on the doctrine of Colossians and Ephesians, and would have had to go on to union with Christ, which is not his subject here.<a name=480:17></a> His subject is -- How am I, an individual sinner, justified before God?<a name=480:18></a> The answer is, Christ has died for our offences; there the fruits of the old man are blotted out: then, you are dead with Christ; that is, your old man gone (for faith).<a name=480:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Besides, chapter 6 replies to the objection, "Shall we continue in sin?<a name=480:20></a>" etc.<a name=480:21></a> How, says the apostle, shall we live in sin, if we are dead?<a name=480:22></a> You have part in death; certainly that is not to live.<a name=480:23></a> <i>Union</i> does not in anywise enter into this argument; only, if we are dead, we must live in some way or other; now that is unto God, through Jesus Christ.<a name=480:24></a> That was enough to shew the practical bearing of this doctrine.<a name=480:25></a> Union relates to our privileges; we are perfect in Christ, members of His body.<a name=480:26></a> The fact that we are in Christ is supposed in chapter 8: 1, and affirmed in a practical manner in verse 9 of the same chapter, but there it is connected with <i>deliverance</i>.<a name=480:27></a> But the aim of the apostle in his reasoning is to shew that we have done with the flesh, and consequently with sin, and that we derive our life from elsewhere; so that justification is a doctrine of deliverance from sin, and not of liberty to sin.<a name=480:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 7 death is applied to our relations with the law.<a name=480:29></a> The end of the chapter presents to us the experience of a renewed soul, but (as to conscious position) still in the flesh, of which the law is the just rule, the law which, when we are renewed, is understood in its spirituality.<a name=480:30></a> The consequence of all this is developed in chapter 8, which shews us our position with God, the effect of our being in Christ; just as chapter 5: 1-11 shews what God has been for us, sinners, and what, consequently, we have learned that He is in Himself.<a name=480:31></a> The end of chapter 8 sums up in triumph the consequences of these truths.<a name=480:32></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to your question on the Psalms, you must not believe what they tell you.<a name=480:33></a> According to Mr.<a name=480:34></a> N.<a name=480:35></a>'s avowal (never mine), his views were found in the Psalms and not in the Gospels.<a name=480:36></a> My doctrine is exactly the opposite of Mr.<a name=480:37></a> N.<a name=480:38></a>'s.<a name=480:39></a> He taught that Christ was born in a state of distance from God, and could only meet God on the cross; but that, by His piety, He escaped many of the consequences of His position by birth.<a name=480:40></a> On the contrary, I believe that He was born, and lived up to the cross in the perfect favour of God; and that in grace He entered in spirit, into the sorrows and troubles of His people, and particularly at the end, when His hour was come.<a name=480:41></a> On the cross He did indeed drink the cup.<a name=480:42></a> But I have no idea that His sufferings are in question only in the Psalms; on examination, I even think that a far less number of the Psalms apply directly to Christ than is generally thought.<a name=480:43></a> The Psalms, viewed in their prophetic sense, depict the circumstances and afflictions of the remnant of Israel.<a name=480:44></a> That Christ, in spirit, took part in these sorrows of His people, I doubt not; but I say that very few Psalms are direct prophecies of what came upon Him; that some are, need not be said.<a name=480:45></a> But I believe that the New Testament shews us very clearly the relations of Christ with this people.<a name=480:46></a> No doubt the New Testament is not occupied with the remnant, as the Psalms, nor with the future of Israel, as the prophecies, because it treats generally of truths that are deeper, more important, and of another kind; but it puts these things very clearly in their place historically, and quotes the prophecies which relate to them.<a name=480:47></a> We see Jesus weeping over Jerusalem, announcing what was to happen, whether to the disciples in the midst of the nation, or to the nation itself.<a name=480:48></a> The Old Testament gives us the details as to Israel, and speaks more of the result, because that is the subject of which it treats; but the New Testament shews us exactly the place of these things relatively to Christianity, which is its subject, and it takes up, as far as is necessary, the subject of the Old.<a name=480:49></a> As to the sufferings of Christ, it gives historically and by quoting the passages that of which the Old Testament spoke; often it presents to us the feelings of Christ more intimately than the Psalms, and at other times cites these latter as explaining what had taken place.<a name=480:50></a> For my part, I take what I find in the Old Testament as having the same authority as the New.<a name=480:51></a> If the Old Testament says, "In all their afflictions he was afflicted," the New gives us to hear Jesus Himself saying with tears, "How often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not.<a name=480:52></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I can easily understand that many Christians do not rightly seize what concerns the remnant of Israel nor the interest which the Lord has in them; and that does not trouble me; but when one expounds the Psalms, one must expound them according to their true sense, and I judge, this gives a far deeper perception of the patient grace of Jesus.<a name=480:53></a> Still, I think it important it should remain a means of edification, and not a subject of dispute; otherwise, Christ loses His savour for the heart, or at least the heart loses the sweet fragrance of His grace.<a name=480:54></a> If it be said that these sufferings (which I do not admit) are not found in the New Testament, but in the Old, it is clear then that, in explaining the Old, we must speak of them.<a name=480:55></a> But the Lord speaks of His position such as Zechariah 13 depicts it, and consequently of the state of the remnant.<a name=480:56></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The New Testament has not in general the remnant for its subject, but Christ the Saviour, and Christianity; but it also treats of the first of these subjects in its place.<a name=480:57></a> Luke 1, 2 are almost entirely occupied with the remnant, historically and prophetically.<a name=480:58></a> Matthew 10 only applies to this subject, and comprehends the whole time up to the end, to the exclusion of the Gentiles and Samaritans.<a name=480:59></a> It is the same thing, under another form, in chapter 11.<a name=480:60></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is said that Christ suffered only in expiation, or through sympathy.<a name=480:61></a> Do you think He suffered nothing when He denounced the scribes who hindered poor souls from receiving Him?<a name=480:62></a> Read Matthew 23: did not His heart suffer?<a name=480:63></a> "He suffered being tempted," is a cardinal truth of the word.<a name=480:64></a> When He asked His disciples to watch with Him, He was not yet drinking the cup, but His sweat was, as it were, great drops of blood.<a name=480:65></a> That was not sympathy: He sought it, but found none.<a name=480:66></a> It is a very serious thing to deny the sufferings of the Son of man.<a name=480:67></a> There was sympathy at the tomb of Lazarus; but in approaching death, and always, more or less, He <i>suffered</i> -- in love, in grace no doubt, but really; assuredly not on account of what was in Him, or of His own relationships with the Father, "but it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things, to make the captain of our salvation perfect through sufferings.<a name=480:68></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I earnestly entreat you not to make these things a subject of controversy; it is a subject, rather, for adoration: to contend about these points, mars and tends to destroy all holy affections.<a name=480:69></a> When I see Paul express himself as he has done at the commencement of Romans 9 shall I say that Christ, whose Spirit urged the apostle to these sentiments, remained Himself indifferent to the unbelief of the beloved people?<a name=480:70></a> He died for <i>the nation</i>; it is clear that that was expiatory, but it is a proof that He loved it as a nation.<a name=480:71></a> The sufferings of Christ are a subject of great importance, and the New Testament, as well as the Old, shews that Israel was, in a special way, the object of affections which caused Him to suffer.<a name=480:72></a> Now, His sympathy was with the sorrows of humanity, but He felt, as He expressed it, the iniquity which (but for the sovereign grace of God) put an end to all the hopes of Israel and to the enjoyment by the beloved people of all the promises.<a name=480:73></a> When He said, "It cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem," and calls it the city "which killest the prophets and stonest them that are sent unto thee;" did He say it with callous indifference?<a name=480:74></a> That was not expiatory; and He could not have sympathy with the iniquity which did it.<a name=480:75></a> These words only reproduce with a more touching affection, and a heart from which all selfishness and self-interest were absent, the expression of the Psalm [102: 14]: "Thy servants take pleasure in her stones.<a name=480:76></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		No doubt, one may present these things badly.<a name=480:77></a> The affections of the Saviour are too delicate a subject to be handled roughly, without falsifying or, so to speak, wounding them; but that any should deny them, is to me distressing.<a name=480:78></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Messiah was cut off, and all the hopes of the beloved people were lost with Him -- to be recovered, no doubt; now I do not believe that Christ has not suffered on this account .<a name=480:79></a>.<a name=480:80></a>.<a name=480:81></a> .<a name=480:82></a>

		[Mons.<a name=485:1></a> Eynard] [<i>From the French</i>.<a name=485:2></a>] BELOVED BROTHER, -- I have not seen the writings which are circulating in Switzerland, but here the immortality of the soul, that is to say, of the soul that has not received Christ, is denied by all who have adopted these ideas.<a name=485:3></a> Among them are found two classes: those who make the soul perish finally with the body, and those who say that, although death be the end of the soul as of the body, man will be raised again to be judged and then burned by degrees like a branch.<a name=485:4></a> The natural immortality of the soul, by the will of God in creation, is denied by both classes.<a name=485:5></a> They cite the passage, "God only has immortality," forgetting that the angels do not die, and that the one who wrote it himself had immortality, according to their system.<a name=485:6></a> That God <i>can</i> destroy, I allow, as He could create.<a name=485:7></a> The question is to know what He says.<a name=485:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In their system, man is a "living soul," and so is a beast.<a name=485:9></a> Now, it is very plain that if a beast were to receive eternal life, it could not be held guilty, in respect to what it had done as a beast; that is to say, that this system overturns the nature of man.<a name=485:10></a> We are the offspring ( gevno" ) of God; Adam was, in this sense, son of God.<a name=485:11></a> Made to enjoy Him, we are perfectly miserable without Him.<a name=485:12></a> How true this is!<a name=485:13></a> Now, I say that in this system expiation is null, since it took place for things done by the flesh, which differs nothing from that of a beast.<a name=485:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I doubt whether one could find a single passage to shew that "destroy, destruction," signify the absolute cessation of existence.<a name=485:15></a> They admit, it is true, that nothing is annihilated, but they say that the soul by means of the fire loses its personality and its individuality, and is dissolved into its elements.<a name=485:16></a> Just like a bit of charcoal -- I have answered them.<a name=485:17></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Their tricks and dishonesty, besides, soon gave proof of the source of their doctrine.<a name=485:24></a> The soul of the child brought back to life by Elisha returned, and re-entered its body.<a name=485:25></a> As for their fine theories about the goodness of God -- men who insist upon absolute destruction or restoration -- we must understand that not only man, but Satan and his angels are in question; otherwise, these theories would be but man's love for his own race, and it would be a fraud to speak of God, as though it were a question of His glory.<a name=485:26></a> I say this, not to reason about it, but to shew that it concerns the spirit and pretensions of those who maintain these doctrines.<a name=485:27></a> We always find, in them, the spirit of lying.<a name=485:28></a>

		As for the word aijwvnio", it is certain that the ordinary sense of the word, when it is employed in an absolute manner with regard to duration, is 'eternal,' 'that which will never cease.<a name=486:15></a>' Thus, "the <i>eternal</i> Spirit," "<i>eternal</i> redemption," "the <i>eternal</i> God," "the <i>eternal</i> inheritance," and that passage: "The things which are seen are <i>temporal</i>; but the things which are not seen are <i>eternal</i>.<a name=486:16></a>" These last expressions determine the signification of the word in an incontrovertible manner.<a name=486:17></a> Aristotle derives it from ajei; w[n, and Philo, of the apostles' time, says that the word signifies, not a past nor a future, but 'present perpetual subsistence.<a name=486:18></a>' I have found other passages, but I have not my memoranda here to give them to you.<a name=486:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But what, to my mind, gives such seriousness to this doctrine, is that in it there is no immortality of the soul, no responsibility, really no expiation.<a name=486:20></a> Death, with them, is the cessation of existence; if not, all their system falls through.<a name=486:21></a> They make that which does not exist at all to rise again; and that has forced some among them (here, a great number) to deny all existence after death.<a name=486:22></a> But then, there is no sense in judgment after death (Hebrews 9: 27), and to raise that which does not exist, has no sense either.<a name=486:23></a> Now, if the human soul is like that of a beast, which, of itself, ceases to exist with the body, responsibility falls to the ground; Christ has died for that which is nothing.<a name=486:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nevertheless, every believer knows very well that when he was converted he, as responsible, took account of all that he had done previously, and he believes that Christ died for that.<a name=486:25></a> Now, if one had only a living soul like a beast, it could not be so.<a name=486:26></a> They say that the wages of sin is death; but if I die before the Lord returns, I shall pay the wages myself.<a name=486:27></a> And indeed, I have never found among them <i>one single person</i> who had not lost the doctrine of the atonement.<a name=486:28></a> Those who had been Christians would not have denied it when they were questioned: but, they had lost it.<a name=486:29></a> Christ, they say, died to obtain eternal life for us, never for what we had done, not having an immortal soul.<a name=486:30></a> This would in fact be nonsense.<a name=486:31></a> A beast, receiving eternal life, could not hold itself responsible for its previous life.<a name=486:32></a> Hence, all appeals to man, what is said to Cain, all the reasonings, all the ways, all the invitations of God, as well as His law, become a great divine action which is more than to no purpose; it is a deception.<a name=486:33></a> Now, if the soul is immortal, the question is settled.<a name=486:34></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		They cite this passage: "God only has immortality," an evident proof that they are not straightforward, for they are forced to confess that the angels do not die, and, more than this, Paul himself, from their own point of view, had immortality when he wrote that.<a name=486:35></a> But "mortal" is applied only to the body: "In this mortal body," "This mortal shall put on immortality," etc.<a name=486:36></a> It is also said in Luke 20: 38, "For all live unto him.<a name=486:37></a>" And "Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.<a name=486:38></a>" (Luke 12: 4.<a name=486:39></a>)

	<div class="paragraph">
		They do not accept annihilation; nothing, say they, perishes; but for them, the soul is dissolved, loses its individuality like a branch that is burned.<a name=486:40></a> Now God has breathed into our nostrils the breath of life.<a name=486:41></a> "We are the offspring of God;" sons of Adam, son of God.<a name=486:42></a> (Luke 3: 38.<a name=486:43></a>) The threat of death addressed to Adam if he ate of the tree, was but a <i>brutum fulmen</i> if he was to die in any case.<a name=486:44></a>

		They found much upon the Old Testament; thus, "The soul that sinneth it shall die.<a name=486:45></a>" (Ezekiel 18: 4-20.<a name=486:46></a>) But, when we <i>examine</i> these passages, we find that what is in question is always a judgment that is to come upon this earth.<a name=486:47></a> Death never signifies <i>cessation</i> of <i>existence</i>, never; not even the second death, for that <i>is</i> the lake of fire.<a name=486:48></a> Then, the picture of Lazarus and of the wicked rich man shews it, in an indisputable manner.<a name=486:49></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But that which, to me, renders the thing so important, what to the Christian is even a <i>moral</i> demonstration, is that all the ways of God towards sinners are but a lie if we have not an immortal soul, and the atonement is no more true for us, than for those that perish.<a name=486:50></a> If I have nothing but the soul of a beast (the measure of intelligence matters little), Christ could not really have died for my sins, nor say that He was the propitiation for the whole world.<a name=486:51></a>

		"Destruction" does not signify ceasing to exist, but ruin, as to the state in which one subsisted.<a name=486:65></a> We find the same word in such passages as these: "The <i>lost</i> sheep of the house of Israel.<a name=486:66></a>" "Master, we <i>perish</i>.<a name=486:67></a>" "O Israel, thou hast <i>destroyed</i> thyself, but in me is thy help.<a name=486:68></a>" "The world that then was .<a name=486:69></a>.<a name=486:70></a>.<a name=486:71></a> <i>perished</i>.<a name=486:72></a>" "<i>Destroy</i> not him with thy meat.<a name=486:73></a>" "Who shall be punished with everlasting <i>destruction</i> from the presence of the Lord.<a name=486:74></a>" What is meant by "punished with <i>everlasting</i> destruction"?<a name=486:75></a> All destruction is everlasting, if the thing destroyed ceases to exist.<a name=486:76></a> And this case is the more striking that, according to them, this passage treating of the judgment at the commencement of the millennium, the destruction there mentioned is not eternal in the sense which they give to the word, for those who are punished subsist afterwards.<a name=486:77></a> I quote from memory, but a concordance will furnish you with many other passages.<a name=486:78></a> Here I only speak of some words which they misuse, and of the points that render this question a capital one for me.<a name=486:79></a>

		These doctrines are very general here, but I think that God is raising a barrier against them.<a name=486:80></a> The persons who taught them believed in the coming of the Lord wrongly; but they believed in it, and had far more light than those who were orthodox.<a name=486:81></a> That attracted souls who were seeking light, and they drank in the poison at the same time with the truth.<a name=486:82></a> Now, those whom I have met have not been able to withstand the word, and that which had the vain glory of possessing the light, is rejected as an abominable heresy by those who are certainly more enlightened upon older truths than themselves.<a name=486:83></a>

		I trust you may not get into controversy with these annihilationists.<a name=489:6></a> It has been a trial here and in the States, that those who hold the Lord's coming on this Continent (though their views of it are quite false) are generally in these views.<a name=489:7></a> This very naturally raised prejudice against them.<a name=489:8></a> One of the services I and others have had to render, is to separate the two in people's minds, and a testimony has been so raised up.<a name=489:9></a> The Evangelicals could not meet them, for they held to traditions which these false teachers refused from scripture.<a name=489:10></a> But a true testimony, thank God, has been raised up, though a small one.<a name=489:11></a> I need hardly say that I hold fast the immortality of the soul, and have insisted on it earnestly at New York, Boston, and Milwaukee, where I have met these false teachers, and a good many have been set free from the doctrine or connection with it.<a name=489:12></a> It has been a formal question as to union with many, and a main difficulty as to the work in New York and Boston.<a name=489:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I am quite aware of the passage -- refers to; and when first published in French (it was translated into English) from notes of lectures at Geneva, it is very possible it was not guarded against misinterpretation, as no one thought of denying the immortality of the soul or calling it in question.<a name=489:14></a> It is a statement that the doctrine of the immortality of the soul in contrast with resurrection was brought in by Platonism and philosophy in the third century; which is perfectly correct.<a name=489:15></a> Heretical teachers, and those orthodox, infected with what is called Neo-platonism, began to deny the Lord's coming as a present expectation, and to teach simply the soul's going to heaven.<a name=489:16></a> That it does so was fully stated in the lectures.<a name=489:17></a> It was the setting aside the Lord's coming and resurrection, to bring in the mere doctrine of an immortal soul -- man's pride as to his importance, not God's power when Christ came -- which was objected to.<a name=489:18></a> But as no one dreamed then of questioning that immortality, it was expressed so that it might be laid hold of.<a name=489:19></a> Perhaps it is so in the first English edition.<a name=489:20></a> But they all know as well as I do, that not only the contrary was held but taught in the book; and that it was the substitution of the immortality of the soul, instead of, and to the rejection of Christ's coming and the resurrection, which was objected to; and it was in fact the ruin of the church.<a name=489:21></a> But, as I said, that immortality was questioned by no one then, and it never occurred to any one that any one did.<a name=489:22></a> I heard of this poor piece of dishonesty years and years ago, and in the subsequent editions took care to remove all occasion for it.<a name=489:23></a> It is a poor fraud, and nothing else.<a name=489:24></a> I have not the book here, or I would refer to it.<a name=489:25></a> I find it in "Collected Writings," vol.<a name=489:26></a> 2 page 463 (I have not the first edition), "It is hardly needful to say that I do not doubt the immortality of the soul.<a name=489:27></a> I only assert," etc.<a name=489:28></a> -- I suppose to be added to the first edition because this use was attempted to be made of it.<a name=489:29></a> But the object of the passage is plain enough, and perfectly put historically, and of all-importance as to the doctrine of the church; it was just the turning-point of its ruin.<a name=489:30></a> If you can get a sight of the book, you will see I have given a just account of the statement above.<a name=489:31></a>

		As regards the main subject, it is a horrible system; it upsets the atonement and human responsibility.<a name=489:32></a> For if in my unconverted state I have no more soul than a beast, save as to mere mental capacity, how can I be answerable for my sins and grieve over them, and Christ have to bear them?<a name=489:33></a> If death be the wages of sin, if I die before Christ comes, I have paid the wages myself.<a name=489:34></a> The rest is all fiction; but Mr.<a name=489:35></a> -- is wrong on every point.<a name=489:36></a> Death <i>never</i> means ceasing to exist, but ceasing to exist here, even as to a beast.<a name=489:37></a> The fact of death can tell us nothing beyond, though scripture does; while it clearly tells us that man can only kill the body, and that the soul is still there; "all live to him," as the rich man and Lazarus clearly point out, and many passages.<a name=489:38></a> The second death is declared to be the lake of fire, not ceasing to exist.<a name=489:39></a> As to eternal torment, eternal punishment is found in Matthew 25, and the word there translated punishment is translated torment in 1 John 4: 18, and justly: punishment or torment is its sense.<a name=489:40></a>

		If death is a state of being as he says, then there is a <i>being</i> which is dead, his own statements are self-contradictory.<a name=489:41></a> Death is not the extinction of conscious being in man, as Luke 20: 38, and Dives and Lazarus shew.<a name=489:42></a> Death in sin is not the offence; it is the state of the offender.<a name=489:43></a> In the Old Testament, life and incorruptibility were not brought to light, and they want to bring us back to the state of darkness even saints were lying in then.<a name=489:44></a> For note, these passages from the Old Testament apply to saints as much as sinners: though they have eternal life, therefore, on their theory, they had ceased to exist, and what eternal life had they?<a name=489:45></a> Yet they are the words of saints and not sinners.<a name=489:46></a> They will have it that we die, cease to exist, unless we get eternal life, which is only in Christ; but we die all the same if we have eternal life, so that it evidently has nothing to do with it: nay, Christ died -- did He cease to exist?<a name=489:47></a> Some of them have told me He did.<a name=489:48></a> So scripture always in speaking of mortality, speaks of the body, and of the saints consequently as in 1 Corinthians 15, as much as sinners.<a name=489:49></a> These are not delivered from this condition by Christ; they are as mortal as before, only dead in theirs.<a name=489:50></a> The punishment is not <i>death</i>: "It is appointed unto men <i>once</i> to die, and <i>after this</i> the judgment" that is, all imposed by judgment to come is after death: so false are they in every statement they make.<a name=489:51></a>

		[R T Grant] BELOVED BROTHER, -- As regards your hard questions, I am not disposed to be wise above what is written.<a name=492:1></a> It was the old patristic doctrine, but with every imaginable notion tacked to it.<a name=492:2></a> It issued in the <i>limbo patrum</i>, or as now expressed, the opening of the kingdom of heaven to all believers, but I humbly think they (nor our friends who speak of it) know nothing about it -- at any rate, I do not.<a name=492:3></a> People like to speak of mysterious things about which we know nothing: we can dogmatise ecclesiastically or hereticise conveniently.<a name=492:4></a> Where was Samuel, and Lazarus, may be settled by both, because God has said nothing.<a name=492:5></a> That Christ's soul went to Sheol I believe from Psalm 16.<a name=492:6></a> The womb is called the lower parts of the earth in Psalm 139, which makes it more mysterious still; that Christ went to paradise and took the thief there as a place of blessedness with Himself is certain.<a name=492:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Sheol is too vague to say anything.<a name=492:8></a> In Numbers 16: 31, they went alive, body as well as soul, into Sheol.<a name=492:9></a> In Isaiah (14) the poetical allusion is to the grave: they rise from their thrones to meet him.<a name=492:10></a> But there, and in Amos (9: 2), it is from burying or swallowing up <i>de facto</i> looked at as on the earth.<a name=492:11></a> So in Psalm 49: 14: they lie in Sheol like sheep: their beauty shall consume in Sheol.<a name=492:12></a> Yet Psalm 16: "Thou wilt not leave my soul in Sheol.<a name=492:13></a>" Here we have New Testament interpretation that His soul was not left in Sheol, nor His flesh saw corruption.<a name=492:14></a> But here, <i>as far as it goes</i>, His coming out was in resurrection.<a name=492:15></a> I say as far as it goes, for only the fact is mentioned.<a name=492:16></a> Still verse 31 (Acts 2) speaks pretty plain.<a name=492:17></a> So it is identified with rB, the pit, in Isaiah 38: 18.<a name=492:18></a> In Luke 16 (Jewish forms of thought, I admit) the rich man is in aJdh and Abraham afar off, and there was a great gulf between.<a name=492:19></a> This as to state of fathers.<a name=492:20></a> All this the fathers made physical truth out of, as some would now, and had a kind of extension on the side of the earth, a cage of happy birds, and hence prayed <i>for</i> the saints to be soon out of it and in the beatific vision, which afterwards came to be praying <i>to</i> them, as to which the liturgy was formally changed.<a name=492:21></a> Epiphanius, I remember, says even the Virgin Mary was prayed for: Christ was the only exception.<a name=492:22></a> But then every one had his own ideas pretty much, till it settled into purgatory in the Roman -- not the Grecian church.<a name=492:23></a> Jonah was in the belly of Sheol.<a name=492:24></a> It is evident the Old Testament saints were all in the dark as to it, with a lightning ray crossing in sometimes.<a name=492:25></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As to 1 Thessalonians 4, "them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him," I have no doubt at all it is after resurrection when He comes again.<a name=492:26></a> Jesus died and rose again, and will come, so the saints with Him, and then in a parenthesis it describes how they get there, and in chapter 5 continues the bringing with Him for the day of the Lord.<a name=492:27></a> Life and incorruptibility were brought to light by the gospel.<a name=492:28></a> All was dark before.<a name=492:29></a> "The living, the living, he shall praise thee.<a name=492:30></a>" The present fruit of death was seen and outwardly they went into the grave, and all was dark beyond.<a name=492:31></a> Saul's being with Samuel was merely being a dead man, I apprehend.<a name=492:32></a> There was also the general idea -- "the spirit shall return to God who gave it.<a name=492:33></a>" The passage in Acts makes it difficult to separate, for Christ, hades and paradise if He was in Sheol till the resurrection, but I believe Sheol is purposely vague and dark, as hades merely means the invisible place.<a name=492:34></a> We know if we depart we are with Christ.<a name=492:35></a> But I do not profess to know much about it (nor do I think others do much more), nor pretend to know more than is said.<a name=492:36></a> I have not a concordance with me.<a name=492:37></a> I have quoted what occurred to my memory: there may be other passages which cast more light on it.<a name=492:38></a> Hoping ere long to see you, and with affectionate love to all the saints.<a name=492:39></a>

		John Pollock, My work here did not give much occasion to write.<a name=495:6></a> It was, as I told brethren, a sowing time, and people do not see much then.<a name=495:7></a> But the truth has spread after all considerably, and some fruits even now appear, not only in many souls who have found peace and see clear as to grace, of which there are many -- I find some new one constantly, so that the truth is borne witness to and propagated by them, people seeing in them the effect -- but the Lord's coming is planted in many souls, and that they have seen, though not all, its connection with the church; and some have at once seen the state of things around them .<a name=495:8></a>.<a name=495:9></a>.<a name=495:10></a> .<a name=495:11></a> There are others, less simple perhaps, but in heart seeing what is right.<a name=495:12></a> Strong as is the influence of belonging to a church here, for position and everything depend on it, with most, at least, in their estimation, the evil state of things is beginning to be felt -- what it is, that is, for its effect was felt by upright souls often before; and through mercy I hear daily of souls that the word has reached for conversion, or finding peace, or getting clear as to the position of themselves or the church; though public meetings, I may say I have none, but I meet with people.<a name=495:13></a> People interested come in small numbers: I have reading meetings, and so on.<a name=495:14></a> I am now about leaving for Boston.<a name=495:15></a> It has been a work of faith and patience here, but I am beginning, through grace, to see the fruits.<a name=495:16></a> Brethren do not much know what it is to begin a work in the midst of Babylon, not mere preaching to crowds, nor with links out on every side through those that are in, but dependent on God alone for the work, and every link to be formed.<a name=495:17></a> Still He leads, and if you can trust and pray to Him for a place, the way will open.<a name=495:18></a>

		The truth is evidently penetrating in this country, silently in many respects, but to a considerable extent, and we are on good footing.<a name=495:19></a> It is beginning to be felt there is reality in it, not mere notions; and here the sad state of things around helps their consciences on.<a name=495:20></a> The cloud is not bigger than a man's hand, but I believe there is unequivocal blessing.<a name=495:21></a> It is very likely I may be detained till next spring.<a name=495:22></a> I had thought to be back in July, but the work is opening; I trust the Lord's instruments are preparing, but at any rate, the labourers are few.<a name=495:23></a> The Lord willing, we shall have our meeting at Guelph, I suppose in June.<a name=495:24></a> I shall be very glad to see the brethren again in England: but the Lord's work is my life down here as to service.<a name=495:25></a> If then near sixty-eight I may be less active, but shall do the work, through grace, which He has for me to do.<a name=495:26></a>

		Dearest W Kelly, -- As regards N.<a name=496:1></a>'s circulated letter, I cannot regret it.<a name=496:2></a> The <i>Rainbow</i>, as I learnt from the middle of Kentucky, in a review of the recent tracts, says Newtonianism is coming in like a flood.<a name=496:3></a> He has given the answer.<a name=496:4></a> The Lord's hand is in that: there is nothing like trusting Him.<a name=496:5></a> N.<a name=496:6></a> knows, as you say, very well who are really opposed to him.<a name=496:7></a> At least, the Lord has made him, poor fellow, declare it.<a name=496:8></a> He quotes, as all have done, H.<a name=496:9></a>'s and page 's statements as mine, but what I have never said at all.<a name=496:10></a> I do pity these poor brethren who have thus committed themselves to the enemy; and it seems to me poor N.<a name=496:11></a> and his friends must be sunk very low to have to profit by weapons so furnished by others.<a name=496:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to what he says, it is important in another point of view.<a name=496:13></a> It is a practical admission that he is now where he always was as to doctrine.<a name=496:14></a> It is quite true that he did not teach that Christ was at a moral distance from God.<a name=496:15></a> Nor did any one but Irving, and not even Irving on his own view of the case; he said Christ had a fallen nature, but it was not sin where not yielded to, and Christ never did, and so was in God's favour, and thus won the Spirit for us.<a name=496:16></a> But further in this paper Mr.<a name=496:17></a> N.<a name=496:18></a> states, that this absence of moral distance was true on the cross when Christ was forsaken of God, and hence the negation of moral distance does not hinder Christ's having been forsaken of God all His life, and that was really the question with Mr.<a name=496:19></a> N.<a name=496:20></a> He had, he said, to make His way to a point where God could meet Him, and that point was death -- death on the cross.<a name=496:21></a> He was extricating <i>Himself</i> out of the relative position He was in by piety, prayer, etc.<a name=496:22></a> But Mr.<a name=496:23></a> N.<a name=496:24></a> did state that He suffered not expiatorily, if words have any meaning, and enlarged upon it, for he stated that He suffered not vicariously.<a name=496:25></a> However, he relinquished this afterwards, and it is not now material.<a name=496:26></a> It was as born a Jew, that He was in this relative position (and He was farther from God than Israel when they had made the golden calf), and as born of Adam.<a name=496:27></a> He did not state that He was in the personal condition of a sinner: I do not know who ever did, that called himself a Christian.<a name=496:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to experiences, his statement was, that Christ had the experiences which an unconverted elect man ought to have -- I do not know whether he calls an unconverted elect man a sinner -- and the wrath of Sinai was pressed upon Him by God's heavy hand.<a name=496:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		His statements as to those he calls Darbyites are mere clap-trap to catch people.<a name=496:30></a> I never heard any such language nor thoughts as "the excellency attached to His own personal condition being cancelled.<a name=496:31></a>" For my own part, as far as any difference can be predicated of His personal excellency (which strictly it cannot), there was no time it shone so brightly as at the cross, for there His obedience was consummated in the highest way, "<i>Now</i> is the Son of man glorified"; "<i>Therefore</i> doth my Father love me because I lay down my life.<a name=496:32></a>" As to the word obedience including all His obedience, I have no objection, looked at as a moral whole.<a name=496:33></a> It is not the act or acts as such, but the obedience in contrast with disobedience which is looked at.<a name=496:34></a> When it is said, that to say any of His sufferings were not necessary to the completion of His work in making atonement is to say that He did not suffer as a Redeemer, which would be a heresy -- it is again mere clap-trap.<a name=496:35></a> His sufferings of course were all necessary to redemption, so was His birth, so was His sinlessness.<a name=496:36></a> It is another question what atonement and redemption were wrought by.<a name=496:37></a> "We have redemption through his blood," and "without shedding of blood there is no remission.<a name=496:38></a>" That the character and results of redemption were the same for Christians or saints before Christ or in the millennium, is perfectly true, nor did I ever hear of any one who doubted it.<a name=496:39></a> But if scripture be true, redemption was not the sole end of His sufferings.<a name=496:40></a> In the first place, the great end was not our redemption at all, but the divine glory.<a name=496:41></a> In the next place, as to application, He was receiving the tongue of the learned that He might know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary.<a name=496:42></a> He suffered, that we might not have a high priest who cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities.<a name=496:43></a> "For in that he himself has suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.<a name=496:44></a>" Another object was to annul the power of him that had the power of death.<a name=496:45></a> In every respect, therefore, the statement is false.<a name=496:46></a> First the ultimate end is the divine glory, and in application other objects are positively stated as scripture objects, dear to the heart of every saint.<a name=496:47></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What is important in this paper is that it witnesses that Mr.<a name=496:48></a> N.<a name=496:49></a> still justifies what he always maintained.<a name=496:50></a> The same want of plain honest statement which characterises heresy is found, characterising the paper in the strongest way.<a name=496:51></a> It denies what nobody accuses him of, and conceals what he really maintained.<a name=496:52></a> It is false in doctrine as to the sufferings of Christ, and, whatever value that has from such a quarter, it is a declaration that those who are accused by Messrs.<a name=496:53></a> H.<a name=496:54></a> and D.<a name=496:55></a> as falling in with his views, he considers as his most ardent adversaries.<a name=496:56></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the expression that Christ was in a certain sense connected with sin, I never heard of its being used.<a name=496:57></a> I do not think it is a desirable one; but "<i>in a certain sense</i>" a man is connected with the burden he bears -- Christ was then made sin for us, to express which the expression, though an ill-chosen one, may be used in so vague a form as "in a certain sense.<a name=496:58></a>" He was there for sin; I do not like the expression, nor am I aware of its being used, but I should understand it in a legitimate sense in one sound in the faith, if used in contrast with appearing the second time cwri;" aJmartiva" -- apart from sin -- having nothing to say to it as to those who look for Him.<a name=496:59></a> I think the expression awkward, but when in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, though He knew no sin, so vague an expression as "in a certain sense" connected with this can be understood, if I have no reason to suspect it is meant to convey there was any sort of sin or sinfulness in Him.<a name=496:60></a> I confess I do not admire it.<a name=496:61></a> But it is a convenient way of dealing with charges of error, to deny stoutly what no one accuses the person of in terms which may be mistaken for the same, to keep entirely out of sight what one is accused of, to accuse and condemn loudly in others what they have never said, and make a number of true statements which nobody calls in question, which both accredit the writer and imply that others deny them.<a name=496:62></a> Such are the real contents of this paper, but it does contain really utterly unsound doctrine as to the sufferings of Christ -- the same held by Messrs.<a name=496:63></a> H.<a name=496:64></a> and others -- the denial of any sufferings besides atoning ones.<a name=496:65></a> If this is not meant, the statement is a shuffle on the most sacred subject possible.<a name=496:66></a> But it has its importance in many respects, and the Lord's hand is in it.<a name=496:67></a>

		I know that dear -- does not admit the eij" and ejpiv.<a name=496:69></a> [Romans 3: 22.<a name=496:70></a>] I regret it, but it is a mere question of clear interpretation.<a name=496:71></a> The end of chapter 5, particularly verse 18, confirms in the strongest way what I have myself no doubt is the true sense; movement towards is included in eij", though elliptically, as all Hellenists admit; it may be used in the way of rest, but always implies motion; though it may speak of what motion has brought us to, and so be used when there is none.<a name=496:72></a> Indeed, it is a found expression to connect tou;" pisteuvonta" with the first eij" pavnta".<a name=496:73></a> But it is as much interpretation as Greek, though I think it decidedly forcing the Greek to connect t.<a name=496:74></a> page with eij" pavnta".<a name=496:75></a> But instead of man's righteousness by law, which would be exclusively Jewish, as the chapter shews, it is God's righteousness, and so to all.<a name=496:76></a> It is <i>on</i> all those only who believe, but that includes Gentiles also if they believe.<a name=496:77></a> But it is not a point I should contest, but leave it to spiritual discernment.<a name=496:78></a>

		Dear G V Wigram, -- .<a name=499:1></a>.<a name=499:2></a>.<a name=499:3></a> As to the tracts, it is a thing I commit to God.<a name=499:4></a> I have not read brethren's publications; I have to study generally when I have any time to read, but it has exercised my spirit.<a name=499:5></a> I have seen truths taken by themselves and pushed to an extreme.<a name=499:6></a> I see God allowing it, as in revival preaching, but the preaching is more healthful where it is -- not weakened through fear, but right, and conscience dealt with.<a name=499:7></a> The desire to carry grace fully out sometimes weakens this: godly discipline counteracts the mischief, but Satan uses it within and without.<a name=499:8></a> Many who preached in Ireland, not among brethren, carried it the furthest of any, and though counteracted by godliness in the preachers and writers, it carries its seed with it.<a name=499:9></a> My mind is a guarded mind, but I find very few who see what I am guarding statements about; and most minds take in statements crudely, unless guarded by right apprehensions from God in themselves.<a name=499:10></a> Experience met by Christ, and divine righteousness and being in Him, and then His help too in experiences, is different from feeding on experience, or jumping into glory and peace without an experience at all.<a name=499:11></a> Knowing ourselves is not justification, and never will be; but pardon known at once is not knowing ourselves, and this too there must be.<a name=499:12></a> It may come after pardon, and in these free gospel days often does.<a name=499:13></a> Romans 7 comes after 3 but before 8.<a name=499:14></a> We may get 3 and 8 after 7, as was my own case, but 8 <i>never</i> comes before 7.<a name=499:15></a> There is no solid peace when experience is fed on; there is no crop by ploughing, but no good crop without it.<a name=499:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have long dreaded brethren overwriting themselves; as I said, and individuals have their tracts.<a name=499:17></a> As it is, perhaps so much the better, but as a testimony of what brethren's witness is there is that which makes me often think.<a name=499:18></a> Very few minds modulate and co-ordinate truth, and it is apt therefore to lose its energy, I mean by modulating it -- unless in the unhindered power of the Holy Ghost <i>dealing with souls</i>.<a name=499:19></a> The Lord lay His good hand to what is wanting.<a name=499:20></a> The mind of man is generally <i>einseitig</i> (one-sided).<a name=499:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The work is going on, but there is nothing special that I know of to report.<a name=499:22></a> It is the going on of feeble beginnings, but the truth spreading, and wants discovered by it.<a name=499:23></a> There is not as yet here that energy of labour there was at first, getting into degraded parts to win souls, unless perhaps in Toronto.<a name=499:24></a> There is not the same opportunity quite in a new country.<a name=499:25></a>

		Circumstances have led me over the ground of the "Sufferings of Christ," correcting "Synopsis" vol.<a name=499:26></a> 2, and translating the Psalms compared with Hebrew.<a name=499:27></a> I confess I am astonished at the ground D.<a name=499:28></a> and H.<a name=499:29></a> have taken, and all objectors -- not that I have read their pamphlets, but I mean the substance of the question.<a name=499:30></a> I would not for ten thousand worlds give up what I apprehend of the Lord's sufferings, and which they deny.<a name=499:31></a> Unless graciously recovered, I cannot help feeling they must sink lower and deeper, so serious do I feel it.<a name=499:32></a> The Lord forbid it, I heartily say, but I do say it is very serious.<a name=499:33></a> Of the two, I fear, though I attach no importance to expressions in the matter, that my explanations may have weakened the expression of the truth, and of the reality of Christ's sufferings, quite admitting imperfectness in any of them.<a name=499:34></a> The connection with the Jewish remnant, though instructively true, is of comparatively little moment as to the evil, I feel.<a name=499:35></a> It is the denial of sufferings other than atonement or sympathy.<a name=499:36></a> This takes away what possesses the soul in thinking of Christ down here, and meant of God to do so.<a name=499:37></a> Hebrews 2 and the like become unintelligible statements to be explained away: so chapter 5.<a name=499:38></a> And when I read Psalm 40 it is unintelligible to me how any one can miss seeing sorrows connected with what wrought atonement, but which was not atonement.<a name=499:39></a> A Saviour lying in Gethsemane was neither atonement nor sympathy.<a name=499:40></a> Every God-taught soul feels, if it cannot explain, the truth I insist on.<a name=499:41></a> It is known in piety and grace, if not in doctrine.<a name=499:42></a>

		Dear C McAdam, -- .<a name=503:1></a>.<a name=503:2></a>.<a name=503:3></a> We are at our Guelph meeting.<a name=503:4></a> I am a great deal better, though weak.<a name=503:5></a> Our meeting, somewhat of a new character, has been very happy -- new, because we had many from the States in different degrees of progress, of getting into liberty (indeed they had got that, but) to see the church, and other truths we are accustomed to rejoice in, the Lord's coming and others.<a name=503:6></a> They all broke bread, though some had been close Baptists.<a name=503:7></a> How far they will break loose, or be among brethren, I cannot tell.<a name=503:8></a> Some -- one Baptist minister in particular -- have left their systems, are just out, and have taken no further step.<a name=503:9></a> The Spirit of God has been working in them, and is, and the meeting has been a help to them, but there are many adverse influences, and one waits to see the result of His work.<a name=503:10></a> Such a scene was all new to them: as to the truths, they had been gradually growing into them when I was at New York, but I greatly trust that the meeting will have been a real blessing.<a name=503:11></a> It has been less simply among brethren, but a quiet, diligent study of the scripture, and the brethren happy.<a name=503:12></a> We need labourers to promote the work; otherwise they are going on nicely.<a name=503:13></a> I have rallied, and it is very possible I may go to the West Indies before I return -- finish, as to places, my course there, but this is in the Lord's hands.<a name=503:14></a> The Lord be with you, and keep you.<a name=503:15></a>

		[Mr Slim] DEAREST BROTHER, -- I am almost surprised that after so many years' service you should be afraid of knocks.<a name=504:1></a> There is a difference of natural character in this besides grace, but if I have a decided judgment and course I trouble myself very little about what people say.<a name=504:2></a> If it is for Christ's sake it is our glory.<a name=504:3></a> It is not insensibility I look for, but that with Christ all that should be taken for granted.<a name=504:4></a> Faithfulness will always bring it.<a name=504:5></a> I will not say it is faithfulness, for sometimes God sees good to exercise us thus, but I have had knocks enough to be used to them.<a name=504:6></a> I used years ago to think of poor Jeremiah, who felt these things very much.<a name=504:7></a> "I have neither lent on usury, nor men have lent to me on usury; yet every one of them doth curse me" [Jeremiah 15: 10]; but I think little of it now one way or another, and do not hear a tenth part of it, so much the better, so do not be uneasy for me.<a name=504:8></a> If there be anything to learn from it, and judge in self, it is all a great gain.<a name=504:9></a> I have been very ill, first worn out, then a sharp attack on it.<a name=504:10></a> This made it uncertain whether I should not have to go to England as unable to work.<a name=504:11></a> Thank God I am better, and have through His goodness recovered much strength, and have again returned to the thought of returning if spared by the West Indies -- if so, I suppose straight to Kingston; however, that is in the Lord's hand, if He allows me, for I feel that my health got a pretty rude shake.<a name=504:12></a> If I do go it would be in winter to spring.<a name=504:13></a> My thought would be a visit; a prolonged stay for work I should hardly feel up to .<a name=504:14></a>.<a name=504:15></a>.<a name=504:16></a> .<a name=504:17></a>

		Our meeting, for we are at our annual Guelph meeting, has had something of a new character, as many from the States who were getting into truth were there; it was a serious, quiet and close study of the word, with a happy spirit of communion among brethren .<a name=504:18></a>.<a name=504:19></a>.<a name=504:20></a> .<a name=504:21></a>

		[H M Hooke] DEAR BROTHER, -- I was comforted by -- 's account of Quebec, for I had in vain sought some news of you, and I thought all had gone but -- .<a name=505:1></a> I had no doubt Mr.<a name=505:2></a> -- had entirely abandoned the path he was in before he left Quebec .<a name=505:3></a>.<a name=505:4></a>.<a name=505:5></a> .<a name=505:6></a> He had been frightened into neutral ground.<a name=505:7></a> Mr.<a name=505:8></a> D.<a name=505:9></a>'s attack was a mere occasion of and excuse for taking the step.<a name=505:10></a> If it had been a serious inquiry as to that doctrine<a href="#505:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> for its own sake, he would have written to me for an answer or explanation.<a name=505:11></a> But he never did anything of the kind, nor did Mr.<a name=505:12></a> D.<a name=505:13></a> nor Mr.<a name=505:14></a> H.<a name=505:15></a>, till I wrote to them .<a name=505:16></a>.<a name=505:17></a>.<a name=505:18></a> .<a name=505:19></a> As far as I learn, -- takes a different ground from what he did before leaving; then Mr.<a name=505:20></a> D.<a name=505:21></a> had proved his point that I was wrong.<a name=505:22></a> Now I am not wrong, but it has given occasion to the unlearned to say what is wrong.<a name=505:23></a> If this were all, St.<a name=505:24></a> Paul's writings, St.<a name=505:25></a> Peter tells us, did as much.<a name=505:26></a> I say this not to discuss the doctrine.<a name=505:27></a> The truth is the subject has been blessed more than any recently to brethren in England.<a name=505:28></a> I hear so from all quarters .<a name=505:29></a>.<a name=505:30></a>.<a name=505:31></a> .<a name=505:32></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the truth is it was never the doctrine which was really in question here or in England, though some might be troubled by those who pressed it.<a name=505:33></a> It was an excuse for loose principles and the world; nobody who weighed it in England doubted it, because Mr.<a name=505:34></a> D.<a name=505:35></a> professedly broke with me because my doctrine approached Mr.<a name=505:36></a> N.<a name=505:37></a>'s, to pass over to associate with those who were more or less in them, or linked up with Mr.<a name=505:38></a> N.<a name=505:39></a>'s doctrines themselves.<a name=505:40></a> This would not stand investigation a moment .<a name=505:41></a>.<a name=505:42></a>.<a name=505:43></a> .<a name=505:44></a> The real question was, the unwillingness to abide by principles which are (I am fully persuaded, as of the truth of God) essential to the existence of the Church -- that false doctrine and evil practice should be excluded -- that we should "purify ourselves from these.<a name=505:45></a>" The Church should be the pillar and ground of the truth.<a name=505:46></a> No argument, no pamphlet of any of them was ever directed to any other end than that evil should be allowed in the church.<a name=505:47></a> We should allow of evil.<a name=505:48></a> This went so far in England that one gathering published a signed paper, that if fornication was <i>allowed</i> in the meeting we ought still to own it, and a multitude were published to insist that no meeting could be leavened by any evil in it, but only those individuals who personally imbibed the evil.<a name=505:49></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the meeting at E.<a name=505:50></a>, on loose principles, Mr.<a name=505:51></a> N.<a name=505:52></a> himself was invited, and annihilationism and the non-immortality of the soul openly preached, and the walls placarded about it by persons belonging to that meeting, so that some not with us left it.<a name=505:53></a> 1 Corinthians 5: 7 says, "Purge out therefore the old leaven that ye <i>may be</i> a new lump.<a name=505:54></a>" They ceased to be a new lump at all if they did not; and therefore in the Second Epistle it says, "Ye have proved <i>yourselves</i> clear in this matter.<a name=505:55></a>" If they had sanctioned it, they were all involved in it though they had not done it.<a name=505:56></a> Just as if a person brought false doctrine, he who received him into his house and bid him God speed, partook of his evil deeds.<a name=505:57></a> If I can own as a gathering according to God a meeting which refuses to break with evil doctrine, how can the church be the pillar and ground of the truth?<a name=505:58></a> I know well they make all sorts of excuses, and speak of A infecting B, and B C, etc.<a name=505:59></a> This adds the evil of denying the unity of the body and making independent churches, which they have all driven at.<a name=505:60></a> We are all one, and if I accept a gathering which receives blasphemers, I identify myself with the gathering in principle.<a name=505:61></a> If you receive a person <i>because</i> he is in communion at Toronto, you accept the communion of Toronto, and are one with them; if you reject all owning of another gathering, you are independents; you put your seal on the body as such, not merely on the person who comes.<a name=505:62></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The secret of all is the world, and avoiding the holy discipline of the church of God, and to this end denying the unity of the body and making independent churches.<a name=505:63></a> As I said, in every case it is pleading for the allowance of evil in the church of God -- that false doctrine is no matter.<a name=505:64></a> Thus, in America, all the neutrals have gone freely in communion with those who deny the immortality of soul; whereas scripture says, applying to the very times we have to deal with, "If a man purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, fit for the master's use.<a name=505:65></a>" I never knew the case it did not bring in worldliness or insincerity: perhaps it has been often the effect of worldliness as much as its cause.<a name=505:66></a> Having seen so much of all this matter, though I have never published anything on it, I could not help feeling for you and writing these few lines.<a name=505:67></a> I believe your part is to remain quite quiet and firm, continuing peacefully on the ground on which you have walked.<a name=505:68></a> There is a restless activity in those who are on false ground, which to a spiritual mind betrays where they are.<a name=505:69></a> Quiet firmness in a right path I believe God will bless, though faith may be tried for a while .<a name=505:70></a>.<a name=505:71></a>.<a name=505:72></a> .<a name=505:73></a> My object in writing was more that you might feel you were not forgotten in your trial than anything else -- not to raise or discuss questions; but as far as I am concerned to say -- walk on peacefully on the ground on which you are, and the Lord will be with you and give you peace.<a name=505:74></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Our Guelph meeting is just over.<a name=505:75></a> Many felt it was the happiest we had ever had.<a name=505:76></a> We had a good number from the States, who have been getting on lately in the truth, some uncommonly nice brethren, who had drunk it in in the most interesting way, and enjoyed the reading here especially.<a name=505:77></a> It was very quiet, steady reading of scripture, and communion and fellowship in spirit.<a name=505:78></a> My christian love to the saints with you.<a name=505:79></a>

		But in these days the unity of the body, and separation from evil, are vital points of testimony for Christians.<a name=509:17></a> One is the original and abiding principle of the Church's existence; the other, faithfulness to its nature, and characterising that faithfulness in a special manner in the last days.<a name=509:18></a> To me it is that (both) or nothing.<a name=509:19></a> One is the special purpose of God as to us connected with Christ, the other His nature.<a name=509:20></a> The notion that one can be wittingly associated with evil, and be undefiled, is an unholy notion -- a denial of the nature of holiness.<a name=509:21></a> And in the world the church is the pillar and ground of the truth.<a name=509:22></a> The character of Christ with Philadelphia is, He that is holy, He that is true; the keeping His word and the word of His patience, what is commended in the saints; an open door and only a little strength, but special association with Christ the holy One, and the truth in the midst of a degenerate people.<a name=509:23></a> And things are going on so rapidly in these last days that Christians will be cast on their own ground, and we shall need the word to be our authority, and it is a divine one.<a name=509:24></a>

		[F G Patterson] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- There is nothing new to me in the subject you wrote about.<a name=510:1></a> I had to discuss it twenty-five years ago in Switzerland.<a name=510:2></a> It was the ground the dissenters took against me then, that it was a thing <i>to be</i> formed.<a name=510:3></a> In Switzerland the comparison of an army was presented, that when one corps was passing men said the army was passing, but nothing was really the army but the whole.<a name=510:4></a> I took up the simile, and said it was like recruiting and passing out into the reserve, or freedom from service and new recruits coming in, but it was always the army.<a name=510:5></a> I see now you have used a similar one; but the question is not here.<a name=510:6></a> This is plain: the Holy Ghost being down here, the body as recognised of God is down here too.<a name=510:7></a> The deceased saints do not enter into account as of the body at present, but I said of course they were finally of the body -- of it now in the mind and purpose of God, though not actually, as having passed out of the scene where the body was formed by the Holy Ghost come down from heaven.<a name=510:8></a> My expression I remember was that those who have passed away <i>n'entrent pas en ligne de compte</i> as regards the church actually.<a name=510:9></a> Thus the substance of the tract<a href="#510:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> is an old settled truth for me.<a name=510:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not know that I should have used the word "perfect" body, though I believe the intention of it is sound.<a name=510:11></a> The danger is to deny that anything is ever the body but the present thing on earth; that is, that there will be no body of Christ when He is Head over all things <i>de facto</i>, so that the body is a temporary thing.<a name=510:12></a> I should at present shrink from this.<a name=510:13></a> It is quite clear to me that the body recognised now is on earth, united to the Head by the Holy Ghost come down here, but does union with Christ by the Holy Ghost cease when the saints all go up to meet the Lord?<a name=510:14></a> When they die they are individually with the Lord, but are lost, so to speak, not being raised to their <i>actual</i> connection with the body which is here, where as to personal place the Holy Ghost now is.<a name=510:15></a> I have often said the Holy Ghost does not teach by my negatives.<a name=510:16></a> But supposing a living saint changed when Christ comes, does he lose his union with the Head, lose the Holy Ghost as making him one with Him, and cease to be a member of the body?<a name=510:17></a> This I cannot think.<a name=510:18></a> Negatives are always dangerous things.<a name=510:19></a> The church is His body, and He is to be glorified in the church throughout all ages world without end.<a name=510:20></a> It would be a sad thought to me to cease to be a member of Christ or that that should cease.<a name=510:21></a> "He that is <i>joined to the Lord</i> is one spirit.<a name=510:22></a>" I insisted on the present actuality of the body from 1 Corinthians 12 largely.<a name=510:23></a> "He hath set in the church," etc.<a name=510:24></a> There are no healings in heaven.<a name=510:25></a> That the body is a present thing by the Holy Ghost come down from heaven is as clear in scripture as possible, and to give it up at any time is to give up Christ's care of His members as a man of his own flesh.<a name=510:26></a>

		[C Brockhaus] [<i>From the German</i>.<a name=513:1></a>] BELOVED BROTHER, -- The sisters were quite right in saying I dearly love the German brethren; God's work has taken me elsewhere, but not separated my heart from those beloved ones.<a name=513:2></a> Heaven is my fatherland; I feel it daily more and more.<a name=513:3></a> But I found myself so soon at home in Germany.<a name=513:4></a> I am, so to speak "in the house" in Switzerland.<a name=513:5></a> In France God has richly blessed me; many of the labouring brethren have studied the word with me, and with many I am most closely united.<a name=513:6></a> They have always had and shewn me kindness of every sort.<a name=513:7></a> My intercourse with them has always been, thank God, full of confidence and open-hearted.<a name=513:8></a> I love them dearly.<a name=513:9></a> But nowhere do I feel more affinity than with the German brethren.<a name=513:10></a> We know that we are all one in Christ.<a name=513:11></a> Daily one feels in these last times that the Christian must be a Christian and nothing else but a Christian.<a name=513:12></a> The simplicity and goodwill of the German brethren won my heart from the beginning.<a name=513:13></a> I share your joy and your sorrows as if they were my own.<a name=513:14></a> I always remember your love with a heart full of gratitude.<a name=513:15></a> Indeed, I can say I have everywhere experienced the love of the brethren and discovered the truth of this precious privilege.<a name=513:16></a> I often wonder at my being the object of so much love and kindness, unworthy as I am.<a name=513:17></a> At any rate, this seed is sown from above in no unthankful heart.<a name=513:18></a>

		It is good, dear brother, that we should be tested.<a name=513:19></a> I can say that for more than forty years I have had no other object than Christ; but I have learnt that one can be careless in respect of one's own soul, even when with all faithfulness one labours for the Lord according to His will -- the same power perhaps is not developed in the labour.<a name=513:20></a> In Thessalonians we read: "Work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope;" the springs were open, the three principles of Christianity.<a name=513:21></a> In Revelation: "I know thy works and labour and patience," but "thou .<a name=513:22></a>.<a name=513:23></a>.<a name=513:24></a> hast left thy first love.<a name=513:25></a>" Oh, how often this is the case!<a name=513:26></a> not that at the bottom of the heart the love is grown cold, but the links between the labour and the love are weakened; a man works because the work lies before him.<a name=513:27></a> He loves the work, he would glorify the Saviour, but his work does not flow in the same way from the fulness of the love of Christ's own heart.<a name=513:28></a> The soul is injured thereby.<a name=513:29></a> God in His love chastises us, and renews the flow of love in the heart.<a name=513:30></a> He sets us in His presence and speaks with us in our conscience.<a name=513:31></a> How full of love and patience is He!<a name=513:32></a> how tender with us!<a name=513:33></a> If He were not so, what should we do?<a name=513:34></a> Besides, the "I" of the heart is so deceitful.<a name=513:35></a> It takes account of the advantage of the work of benefiting the brethren.<a name=513:36></a> But in so far as it operates in us, it separates the heart from the realised presence of God.<a name=513:37></a> We are ever so ignorantly confident when not guided by the word of God.<a name=513:38></a> If I think of the Lord, and of His perfection, how He always had the right word ready, the right feeling of heart, how He always was as man before God, the wisdom of the love that was evinced in Him, I feel how poor I am in my best endeavours to serve Him.<a name=513:39></a> Thank God, the work is His own -- by us according to His great love.<a name=513:40></a>

		We began to meet in Dublin, Ireland, 1827-28.<a name=515:1></a><a href="#515:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> It was not dissatisfaction with the apostolic succession of the English national episcopal body.<a name=515:2></a> I had found peace to my own soul by finding my oneness with Christ, that it was no longer myself as in the flesh before God, but that I was in Christ, accepted in the Beloved, and sitting in heavenly places in Him.<a name=515:3></a> This led me directly to the apprehension of what the true church of God was, those that were united to Christ in heaven: I at once felt that all the parish was not that.<a name=515:4></a> The tract I then published was no attack upon anybody, but upon the unity of the church of Christ.<a name=515:5></a> When I looked around to find this unity I found it nowhere: if I joined one set of Christians I did not belong to another.<a name=515:6></a> The church, God's church, was broken up, and the members scattered among various self-formed bodies.<a name=515:7></a> I found membership in scripture was not membership of a voluntary association on earth, but membership of Christ, a hand, a foot, etc.<a name=515:8></a> And as the Holy Ghost had formed one body on descending on the day of Pentecost (1 Corinthians 12), so ministry was those whom He qualified for such or such a service.<a name=515:9></a> So in Ephesians 4 and 1 Peter 4: 10.<a name=515:10></a> At the same time Acts 2 and 4 made me feel how dreadfully far we had all got from the true effect of His presence.<a name=515:11></a> I found, however, that wherever two or three were met in Christ's name He would be in our midst, and acted on the promise with three other brethren and the wife of one of them; and never thought to go beyond thus meeting the need of our consciences and hearts according to the word.<a name=515:12></a> God was doing a work I had no idea of myself, and it spread over the world.<a name=515:13></a> It did not begin at Plymouth till 1832, where I went at Mr.<a name=515:14></a> Newton's request, then a fellow of Exeter College, Oxford.<a name=515:15></a> There were never more than seven hundred there.<a name=515:16></a> It began in London about the same time, through one I had met in Oxford.<a name=515:17></a> It was in no way any particular opposition that led me to Switzerland in 1837, but a report of a brother who had been there, and stated that there were meetings like ours.<a name=515:18></a> They were like in form in some respects, but were really regularly formed dissenting churches, so-called in Europe, with members.<a name=515:19></a> After that I began to work there, then in France; then in Germany, where the work had already begun by another person; then in Holland.<a name=515:20></a> In these last countries the work is far more extended than the article supposes: latterly the blessing has been very great in Northern Germany.<a name=515:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The coming of the Lord was the other truth which was brought to my mind from the word, as that which, if sitting in heavenly places in Christ, was alone to be waited for, that I might sit in heavenly places with Him.<a name=515:22></a> Isaiah 32 brought me to the earthly consequences of the same truth, though other passages might seem perhaps more striking to me now; but I saw an evident change of dispensation in that chapter, when the Spirit would be poured out on the Jewish nation, and a king reign in righteousness.<a name=515:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have merely stated the facts and dates as they occurred.<a name=515:24></a> Mr.<a name=515:25></a> Newton remained Fellow of Exeter for some time after we began to meet at Plymouth.<a name=515:26></a> He has a chapel of his own in London, and has nothing to do with brethren.<a name=515:27></a> He was amongst them, but for years set aside their principles, and since 1845 had had no connection with them.<a name=515:28></a> In 1846 teaching as to relationship of the Lord Jesus to God became a ground of total separation.<a name=515:29></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Mr.<a name=515:30></a> Mller's was a close Baptist church: when the brethren began to make progress in Bristol, he gave this up, and took in a measure the form of the brethren.<a name=515:31></a> These were transferred I think unadvisedly, though with the best intention, to his meeting.<a name=515:32></a> Since 1848 he has returned to, not close Baptist principles, but open Baptist principles, and his is a regular dissenting church with slightly modified forms.<a name=515:33></a> Mrs.<a name=515:34></a> G.<a name=515:35></a>'s account is in no way accurate, and had a special object.<a name=515:36></a> She was not born when the work took place.<a name=515:37></a>

		The power that drink has over people is astonishing.<a name=519:12></a> That was never my temptation, so that I am no judge of the snare, yet I believe that grace can give the victory over that as over every sin, positive deliverance.<a name=519:13></a> Clearness of mind as to the truth is not the question here, but real deliverance.<a name=519:14></a> Nor is anxiety to get owned again always a good sign, but anxiety with God for deliverance.<a name=519:15></a> I say deliverance, for in besetting sins power comes in, and it ceases then to be present to the mind as a temptation: it is the real intervention of God; and this is what a man must look for in such cases.<a name=519:16></a> It is well that this person clings to brethren, a good sign, so far, but the true point is concern of conscience, and seeking above all that God should free him from the temptation.<a name=519:17></a> When the Holy Ghost works in a man who has fallen, it makes him serious and lowly.<a name=519:18></a> It is not the kindliness of man, pleasant as that is, but restoration with God for which we are anxious.<a name=519:19></a> The Lord will guide you, dear brother, in this case.<a name=519:20></a> Firmness for Christ's glory, the holiness of the Table, and for the good of the man himself accompanied by the grace which thinks of him as a member and sheep of Christ, and charges oneself with the burden of his state, these are what will guide aright in these cases; I am not at all fit for cases of discipline, I have not the firmness called for.<a name=519:21></a> As to the manner of acting, the great point is to have the conscience of the brethren with God: "Ye have proved yourselves clear in this matter," says the apostle.<a name=519:22></a> When we look at it thus, it alters everything, otherwise cases of discipline are apt to engage the feelings, and make a party for or against.<a name=519:23></a> This is what the apostle alludes to when he says, "We are not ignorant of his devices.<a name=519:24></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another point is, that if in earnest, a man will avoid the occasion of temptation where he feels he cannot overcome.<a name=519:25></a> I agree that we are not called upon to abstain as a law, and I object to vows or pledges, but if this brother found it a means of avoiding sin he would gladly act on the principle of total abstinence, that he might not enter into temptation; we are to cut off a right hand or pluck out a right eye if it is a stumbling-block to us.<a name=519:26></a> The Lord make him feel the evil, for knowledge without godliness is just the way of dishonouring God, and making those who hate true knowledge find a handle against it.<a name=519:27></a> May the Lord give him lowliness and decision .<a name=519:28></a>.<a name=519:29></a>.<a name=519:30></a> .<a name=519:31></a> Be of good courage, dear brother, be strong, and He shall establish your heart.<a name=519:32></a> Read the first chapter of Joshua, and look to Christ.<a name=519:33></a> He is faithful and full of love.<a name=519:34></a> All we have to do is to go on peacefully, doing His will and ever looking to Him for help.<a name=519:35></a> Kind love to the saints.<a name=519:36></a> I fully hope to get to see them if spared.<a name=519:37></a>

		[<i>From the French</i>.<a name=521:1></a>] BELOVED BROTHER, -- I reply to your questions on the prophet Daniel.<a name=521:2></a> The "desolator" is not named in chapter 9, but I do not believe that the desolator is Antichrist, nor he who takes away the daily sacrifice.<a name=521:3></a> The wickedness that is at work within is not the desolation which comes from without; it is the cause of it.<a name=521:4></a> First, I would have you remark certain points in the translation, which considerably alter the meaning of the sentences.<a name=521:5></a> In chapter 8: 11 the gender is different.<a name=521:6></a> It is no more as in verse 10, "It" (the little horn) "waxed great," but, "And he waxed great.<a name=521:7></a>" This verse 11 does not refer then any longer directly to the little horn.<a name=521:8></a> Then, in this same verse, it is not said that "By him the daily sacrifice was taken away;" but, "From him" (the Prince of the host, Christ Jehovah) "the daily sacrifice was taken away.<a name=521:9></a>" This alters the character of him who is mentioned in verse 4, or rather, this takes away from him that character.<a name=521:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe that what refers to the horn in verse 10, and that which follows, up to verse 12, has been fulfilled in the times of the Seleucidae (Antiochus Epiphanes), and I translate verse 12: "And a time of distress" (a word that one meets in Job with the same meaning) "was ordained for the daily sacrifice.<a name=521:11></a>" All this refers to the horn, as well as the two thousand three hundred evenings and mornings of verse 14, to the oppression of Antiochus, and not to the last days.<a name=521:12></a> At the end of the chapter this period is distinguished from the vision of the evening and the morning.<a name=521:13></a> (verse 26.<a name=521:14></a>) The crafty king, at the end, shall stand up against the Lord of lords, that is to say, that he will be upon the scene when Christ shall be there.<a name=521:15></a> He rises up from the east, and not from the west.<a name=521:16></a> So, at all events, we find here the description of a desolator.<a name=521:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 9: 27, instead of "By means of the abominable wings which shall cause desolation," I read, "Because of the protection of idols, there shall be a desolator;" it is not said who.<a name=521:18></a> The daily sacrifice will be taken away by him who had made the covenant for one week.<a name=521:19></a> In the same verse the "consumption determined" means "the determined accomplishment of the judgment;" it is a technical term, signifying the last judgments on Jerusalem and the Jews.<a name=521:20></a> I believe that the last word of this verse signifies <i>desolate</i>, and not <i>desolator</i>.<a name=521:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It appears clear to me from Isaiah 10: 22-23, and following, that the determined consumption falls upon Judah and Jerusalem by means of the Assyrian, who is the rod of the indignation of God.<a name=521:22></a> Now the Assyrian is geographically of the territory of the Seleucidae.<a name=521:23></a> This is so much the more clear since the same prophet (Isaiah 28: 22) shews us this consumption overtaking the land of Israel, when the leaders of the people at Jerusalem have made a covenant with hell, sheol (Isaiah 28: 14, 15), and have taken refuge in lies.<a name=521:24></a> In Daniel 9: 27 this same consumption comes upon Jerusalem.<a name=521:25></a> The head of the beast makes a covenant with them for one week; idols are there, they put their trust in them, and God sends a desolator.<a name=521:26></a> The Assyrian will be the great desolator; others will ally themselves with him.<a name=521:27></a> (Psalm 83.<a name=521:28></a>) Gog will be the last form of the Assyrian.<a name=521:29></a> That explains, it appears to me, what is said in Ezekiel 38: 17: "Art thou he of whom I have spoken in old time by my servants the prophets of Israel?<a name=521:30></a>" Jerusalem is taken a first time: the second time the enemy finds the Lord there.<a name=521:31></a> Zechariah 14 is general: the city shall be taken, and the Lord shall go forth against the nations.<a name=521:32></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is "the leader who shall come" that will take away the sacrifice in breaking the covenant; and the people giving themselves up at the same time to idols, there shall be a desolator until the chastisement upon Jerusalem is complete, and that the presence of the Lord puts an end to the power of evil and of the evil one.<a name=521:33></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Roman emperor is the head of the beast, and Antichrist is only the head of the second beast in Revelation 13.<a name=521:34></a> He causes the first beast to be worshipped, and exercises his power, being the false Christ, or king and prophet, for the Jews in Judea.<a name=521:35></a> But it is the "leader" who will take away the sacrifice in the beginning of the last half-week; the royalty of the second beast <i>seems</i> to disappear through the power of this leader in the east.<a name=521:36></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The king of the north is always he who rules over the territory occupied by Antiochus; but in the end Russia will possess this territory, or will rule over it, so as to be the Assyrian.<a name=521:37></a> Russia is Gog, unquestionably.<a name=521:38></a>

		[T W Trench] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- In the first place, I am afraid of human accuracy in the things of God: they are too great and we are too little to have it, and we know only in part.<a name=526:1></a> Then, the Holy Ghost does not teach by negatives but by positive revelations, so that we get on human ground.<a name=526:2></a> It may be right.<a name=526:3></a> When we state negatives we must know all absolutely on a subject to use a negative.<a name=526:4></a> If I say a thing is in scripture, one text proves it: if I say it is not, I must know the whole Bible perfectly.<a name=526:5></a> The Holy Ghost is said to dwell in the body; the earnest of the Spirit is said to be given in our hearts.<a name=526:6></a> Surely it acts in the heart, and, I may add, in the mind and conscience.<a name=526:7></a> The Holy Ghost dwells in us individually, and unites us to Christ.<a name=526:8></a> Hence we know also that we are in Christ (John 14); but this is individual, and if only one believer were on earth he would be in Christ -- could not be an assembly, but he would be united to Christ.<a name=526:9></a> The Holy Ghost does not dwell in the assembly as the body (though, through want of accuracy, I have said so in old time) but in it as the house.<a name=526:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ephesians 1: 20, I judge, clearly shews the whole of the body as in glory, because then Christ is over all things -- "we see not yet all things put under him.<a name=526:11></a>" The Holy Ghost has personally come down here and formed the body on earth, and there only it is at present known.<a name=526:12></a> The departed saints do not in this respect count, but the Holy Ghost is a divine Person, and, I have no doubt, holds their spirits in divine power for the time of glory, and even their dust for resurrection.<a name=526:13></a> We are told nothing of departed spirits but that they are with Christ, but they lose no privilege save what is down here.<a name=526:14></a> They surely are not separated from Christ and re-united to Him afterwards; that, as a matter of faith and first principle, cannot be; but the body being <i>de facto</i> down here they do not personally in its present condition make part of it.<a name=526:15></a> I suppose that is what dear -- means.<a name=526:16></a><a href="#526:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> .<a name=526:17></a>.<a name=526:18></a>.<a name=526:19></a> As sometimes anything resting on the mind corrodes there, I write at once as to what seems to me the truth.<a name=526:20></a> Our union with Christ I hold to be surely indissoluble, and consequently to subsist essentially in the separated state -- the how I do not speak of, as I am not aware the word of God does.<a name=526:21></a> The positive responsible body as such is down here consequent on the baptism of the day of Pentecost.<a name=526:22></a> It will not cease to be such when the whole is complete and united to the Head, and I have not a moment's doubt that the departed spirits and their union are divinely maintained by the Holy Ghost.<a name=526:23></a> You will remark that anything to the contrary is only an inference.<a name=526:24></a> We are justified in using consequences to prove error, but not in attributing them to another; he may be shocked at them when he sees them.<a name=526:25></a> Clearly the Holy Ghost is in heaven, though in the economy of grace as they say, He is come down; just as the Son came down, yet was in the bosom of the Father.<a name=526:26></a>

		[G Gausby] MY DEAR BROTHER, -- The unity of the body, and the saints acting on it, I feel to be most important.<a name=528:1></a> In the early church they sent the elements to the sick in token of this unity.<a name=528:2></a> But the assembling in one place I do not think to be of any force, because they broke bread from house to house, or in their houses generally, in contrast with the temple, yet surely in the unity of the body.<a name=528:3></a> Were it done contrary to this it would be the spirit of schism.<a name=528:4></a> There are cases of illness which are temporary discipline.<a name=528:5></a> In such I believe it is better to bow to the Lord's hand and wait recovery.<a name=528:6></a> But when it is not so, but a hindrance which is permanent, and, so to speak, providential, I do not think such an one should be deprived of the privilege; and it has been in fact habitual to minister this comfort to such.<a name=528:7></a>

		[F G Patterson] DEAREST BROTHER, -- As to receiving those weak in the faith (Romans 14: 1): it is simply not to reject them in heart and spirit because they were feeble as to Jewish prejudices and the like.<a name=528:15></a> One man ate herbs, another meat.<a name=528:16></a> One man kept Good Friday -- so to say.<a name=528:17></a> They were to be cordially owned as others, only not to be puzzled by mere questions when they could not bear it.<a name=528:18></a> The receiving to the glory of God (Romans 15: 7), which must apply to the second clause, applies in sense to both.<a name=528:19></a> There lie underneath, Jewish and Gentile jealousies -- both received to the glory of God, rose above all this; and they were so to receive one another -- suggested by verse 6, and suggesting what follows, putting Jews and Gentiles in this place with a common Christ.<a name=528:20></a>

		The passage in Jude (verse 7) I take to be a present figure of the abidingness of judgment.<a name=528:21></a> They were not burnt down and built up again, as other cities may be: they were lying under the abiding effect of the fiery judgment that fell upon them.<a name=528:22></a> The cities continued in the state the judgment of God had reduced them to -- a vivid figure of those who follow in their wake.<a name=528:23></a>

		"Regeneration" is passing from one state to another, used only in Matthew 19, and in Titus.<a name=533:3></a> "Born of the Spirit" is the actual communication of divine life -- "that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.<a name=533:4></a>" This is life: the other (regeneration) is <i>de facto</i> death, though this can only be by life.<a name=533:5></a> But it supposes an entrance into a new state, when fully brought to light, of which resurrection is the expression -- life out of death -- hence leaving sin and an evil nature behind.<a name=533:6></a> So we are baptised to His death, that we walk in newness of life.<a name=533:7></a> It is not merely that I have got life from or through -- but I am quickened with.<a name=533:8></a> But that supposes death, the putting away, but judgment of the old man.<a name=533:9></a>

		"Sanctified," though it includes this, yet contains something more: we are sanctified to something, not merely washed from.<a name=533:10></a> No doubt this does cleanse, but it gives also an object to which I am attached and so sanctified.<a name=533:11></a> A creature is practically and morally always what his object is.<a name=533:12></a> "That he might sanctify and cleanse it" (Ephesians 5: 26) is not quite correct -- aJgiavsh kaqarivsa".<a name=533:13></a> They go together, but the cleansing, though a positive thing from evil, is connected with consecrating the affections to God.<a name=533:14></a> There are holy affections in sanctification: these clearly exclude evil ones; but there are the two things, though they cannot be separated.<a name=533:15></a> The word is in every respect the instrument.<a name=533:16></a> The washing of regeneration is typified, as Peter says, by the flood.<a name=533:17></a> It cleared away the old, but it began a new world.<a name=533:18></a>

		[F G Brown(e?<a name=537:1></a>)] BELOVED BROTHER, -- You must not get discouraged because it does not go on as fast at Boston as you would wish.<a name=537:2></a> What is is solid: it has never been much worked, and God has His own time.<a name=537:3></a> I should be glad if you had some one who could take the tract shop, and set you free when you wished to visit anywhere; but though it has not show, it is very useful, and the truth is considerably disseminated by it.<a name=537:4></a> I should have been glad myself to have worked more at B.<a name=537:5></a>, but the Lord, who is wise, ordered it otherwise.<a name=537:6></a> I believe perseverance is your path of faith now; and be assured we are not weary of anything we can do to help, if you are not.<a name=537:7></a> You have a full place in our hearts.<a name=537:8></a> I feel that I in particular am your debtor for a great deal of kindness.<a name=537:9></a> You may say I never expect a tract dept to pay amongst us.<a name=537:10></a> Indeed, it hardly ever does without adjuncts, and readers of our books are not many in the States yet.<a name=537:11></a> I should think twice before I made a shop of it too: as it stands at present it is service.<a name=537:12></a> Selling Bibles, if practicable, is another thing .<a name=537:13></a>.<a name=537:14></a>.<a name=537:15></a> .<a name=537:16></a>

		Hitherto in infirmity and weakness the brethren have been a testimony, and are more and more publicly so.<a name=537:17></a> I do not expect this to be popular, especially in these last days; conversions may accompany it, and have, thank God, in many cases, as lately in Canada.<a name=537:18></a> But when it was not from the testimony and with it, the preaching left them in the world and in system.<a name=537:19></a> The Lord is over all: our part is to be faithful.<a name=537:20></a> Blessing is going on in these parts .<a name=537:21></a>.<a name=537:22></a>.<a name=537:23></a> .<a name=537:24></a> There is in the west too a movement from the feeling of the state of so-called churches, but they do not break bread for fear of meeting the difficulties of doctrine and discipline; but it does not, I hear, work, though there are devoted ones.<a name=537:25></a> They would avoid evident evil, and have work; but they shrink from believing the Lord sufficient to maintain a testimony.<a name=537:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here I do think the Lord has been most gracious to brethren: I admit the difficulty, but I hold the Lord sufficient; and, if we hold fast the truth and good in the real bonds of Christ, He will use it for what is dear to His heart -- little strength, but holding fast His word, and His name, content with His approbation.<a name=537:27></a> That is what I look to: then surely all the activity to win poor souls one can have; and He sets an open door.<a name=537:28></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is striking, generally crossing the Atlantic I have been led out, and had many occasions.<a name=537:29></a> This time not so: I have just confessed Christ, and spoken to one or two, but have not felt led out at all, yet very happy.<a name=537:30></a> Perhaps from excessive work in London, etc.<a name=537:31></a>, the Lord meant me to have a retreat and be quiet.<a name=537:32></a> I sit, read, write and say nothing to anybody, instead of getting amongst most.<a name=537:33></a> Around me at table they are Spaniards, and I do not know Spanish, but that is not all.<a name=537:34></a> In London, England, etc.<a name=537:35></a>, I felt the Lord greatly with me; and there is an evident work going on, a great desire, and in men particularly, to hear, and many young men, and not novelty, as of course I have been often there; and it is, I hear, general.<a name=537:36></a> Just arrived at Demerara safe, through mercy.<a name=537:37></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I found more opportunity than when I wrote this of speaking to some, and it was understood that I was to be taken on that ground if talked with, which makes it always easy; and I was encouraged with some, but I had less intercourse than often with all around, but read a good deal in spite of heat, which was a hindrance to any application.<a name=537:38></a>

		[<i>From the French</i>.<a name=539:1></a>] -- - I have been greatly struck with the difference of the instruction in that which precedes and follows verse 12 of Romans 5.<a name=539:2></a> To the end of verse 11 it is a question of sins and of our justification, of pardon by the blood and by the resurrection of our precious Saviour.<a name=539:3></a> From verse 12 it is a question of sin, of our condition, common to all before God and not of pardon, but of deliverance; and therefore it is not a question of Christ dying for our sins, but of our death with Him, and of the fact that we live by Him.<a name=539:4></a> The blessedness of the first of these mercies is portrayed in chapter 5: 1-11, that of the second in chapter 8.<a name=539:5></a> The first is specially that which God is Himself, that which He is for the sinner; the second our position before Him and what He is for His own.<a name=539:6></a> In the Epistle to the Romans the sinner is looked at as living in sin, then dead with Christ (he is not yet risen with Him, but living by Him).<a name=539:7></a> In the Epistle to the Colossians the apostle goes further, we are dead in sin and raised with Him.<a name=539:8></a> It is a change of position as well as the communication of a new life.<a name=539:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the Epistle to the Ephesians we are only viewed as dead in sins (even as walking in them) then quickened, raised with Christ, and seated in Him in heavenly places.<a name=539:10></a> In the Epistle to the Colossians the Christian, though raised, is on the earth; his life is hid with Christ in God, he ought to have his affections on high, his inheritance is there preserved for him.<a name=539:11></a> You can examine these things in the word.<a name=539:12></a> What I have said of Romans is very useful for the deliverance of souls.<a name=539:13></a> It is deliverance.<a name=539:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I bless God, dear brother, that He has spared you your dear little girl, after having taken away your son.<a name=539:15></a> His good hand is upon us, even (and very particularly) in things that are painful.<a name=539:16></a> It was not worth while to give a long history of the prosperity of Job, but the Holy Spirit of God has given us details of all that took place in his difficulties.<a name=539:17></a> It was worth while; and it is for the profit of His own to the end of the age.<a name=539:18></a> It is there that the work of our God is found.<a name=539:19></a> May He give us to have entire confidence in Him.<a name=539:20></a> It was the first thing that Satan destroyed before -- and in order that lust might enter into Eve.<a name=539:21></a> Now the entire life of Jesus was the manifestation of love to regain the confidence of the heart of man.<a name=539:22></a> Without doubt he needed grace, but it is what He was, God shewing Himself to man that he might trust in Him.<a name=539:23></a> His death does not diminish the proof of His love.<a name=539:24></a>
