		NOTES OF SERMONS - THE WOMAN OF SAMARIA

	<div class="paragraph">
		John 4: 1-26
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are three chapters in this Gospel of John which speak of the effects and operations of the Spirit of God.<a name=1:6></a> The first is one with which we are all doubtless familiar; namely, chapter 3, which brings before us the power and efficacy of the Holy Ghost in His quickening office -- bringing forth dead souls, and causing them to be born again.<a name=1:7></a> Another is chapter 7, which shews the internal effect of the indwelling of the Spirit, being described by our Lord as "rivers of living water.<a name=1:8></a>" "He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.<a name=1:9></a>" And it is added, "This spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive.<a name=1:10></a>" And in chapter 4 it is very expressly spoken of as "living water," and "a well of water springing up into everlasting life.<a name=1:11></a>" It may be profitable now for us to advert to this subject, and consider it attentively, to ascertain how it is spoken of; what are its operations; and whether we find it in ourselves, as believers, a well of water springing up; and shew how it is rejected by them that believe not.<a name=1:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord Jesus Christ is the giver of the Holy Spirit to them that believe; He is the fountain and giver of all good: all blessings are obtained by His sacrifice and intercession, and in no other way.<a name=1:13></a> Indeed it is the only way God can be a giver to sinful man; there is no possibility of His giving any blessings to us as sinners except through this channel.<a name=1:14></a> As sinners, our intercourse with God is suspended for ever, except through Christ; but through Him the most intimate intercourse is restored.<a name=1:15></a> We lost it by virtue of our association with sin, and were then cast out from the presence of God, bringing forth fruit to the flesh, the world, and Satan.<a name=1:16></a> How could any intercourse subsist between God and us in that state?<a name=1:17></a> The thing was impossible.<a name=1:18></a> But by the finished work of Christ, and in virtue of His resurrection, having taken His people from their former position, and set them in a perfectly distinct state, He brings them into fellowship with the Father, into (as far as regards His work) an unhindered communion with God.<a name=1:19></a>

		They come to know Christ then as the medium of communication, of fellowship, and of intercourse; they see themselves by faith in the presence of God, in the Person of Jesus, and thus have free and unrestrained communion with Him.<a name=2:1></a> Just as by faith they saw themselves cast out from God, so by faith are they brought again into His presence.<a name=2:2></a> Now they are practically conscious that they are driven out -- that they were justly excluded, having wandered from the way of holiness.<a name=2:3></a> This was the fruit of their own work; and then by faith they learn practically, that on the work of the Lord is founded that association which, making them one with Him, brings them into the nearest union and closest communion with God.<a name=2:4></a> They see the transfer of sin, and the transfer of righteousness, bringing them into this state.<a name=2:5></a> He was made "sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.<a name=2:6></a>" In Him we see the whole body -- the church gathered into one -- being made divine righteousness, and so presented to God.<a name=2:7></a> We see Him before God perfect, and we (I speak of believers) in Him.<a name=2:8></a> This blessed righteousness is made known to us by the Spirit which Christ sends down from heaven, and so leads up the souls of His people to a participation in His happiness.<a name=2:9></a> By seeing themselves and their own state by nature, He leads them out of themselves into Christ.<a name=2:10></a> But this is the gift of God.<a name=2:11></a> This is what Christ promised while on earth: "When the Comforter is come, he shall convince the world of sin, and of righteousness.<a name=2:12></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now it is in full agreement with this that the chapter before us unfolds itself -- a chapter replete with most wonderful facts of God's wisdom, and His mighty love.<a name=2:13></a> The Pharisees were jealous and murmured at hearing that Jesus had made more disciples than John.<a name=2:14></a> Jesus therefore, to follow peace with all men, left Judea, and departed again into Galilee, going through Samaria; there being, in His eternal counsel, a needs-be for it -- even to meet with one poor sinner.<a name=2:15></a> He had taken a long journey; He was wearied, and He sat down on the well to recover His exhausted strength.<a name=2:16></a> Indeed it was a world of weariness to Him while He laboured in it.<a name=2:17></a> He had left His rest which He had with the Father from all eternity -- had left His home of glory and of blessedness, and come down to this sinful world to be wearied indeed.<a name=2:18></a> There was everything around to make Him weary -- sin, hatred, ingratitude, ill-will, and open opposition, and toil; but, though wearied in the contemplation of these, He was never wearied in the 
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		testimony of love: this was meat they knew not of.<a name=3:1></a> When driven by exhaustion and persecution from the crowd, we find love taking Him into desert places apart, to pray.<a name=3:2></a> There was no love of bodily ease, no selfishness dictating His conduct in any particular: it was one unmitigated scene of active love.<a name=3:3></a> He was wrapped up in the one sole object for which He was on earth, and nothing could divert Him.<a name=3:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We see how full His whole soul was on the subject from the circumstances related in this chapter.<a name=3:5></a> The providence of God had (so to speak) brought Him to Samaria.<a name=3:6></a> What do we find Him there doing?<a name=3:7></a> Just sitting alone with a wicked sinner by the side of a well to settle the great question of eternity with her, to shew her <i>herself</i>, and to make known <i>Himself</i> to her.<a name=3:8></a> And this He does now to every soul whom He calls to Himself -- just sits alone with them, leads them into the recesses of their own hearts, and then makes known to them in whose presence they are, leading them to ask those gifts which He had prepared for them.<a name=3:9></a> In the case of this poor sinful woman we see the blessed way in which the Lord led her.<a name=3:10></a> She, full of her worldly employment, unconscious whom she was to meet, came to the well.<a name=3:11></a> He first asks her for a drink -- a drink of cold water!<a name=3:12></a> -- considered the very poorest and meanest gift which this world contains.<a name=3:13></a> See how the Lord humbled Himself!<a name=3:14></a> Among the Jews it was considered the depth of degradation even to hold any communion or converse with the Samaritans; to be beholden to them for a favour would not be tolerated by them.<a name=3:15></a> But here we have the Lord of glory asking for a drink of water from one of the worst in the city of the Samaritans!<a name=3:16></a> Such was His humiliation, that the woman herself wonders that such a request should be made from a Jew to one whom the Jews ever looked upon and treated with the greatest contempt.<a name=3:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, brethren, just think of this; do just contemplate the mind and the spirit in which He met this poor outcast -- this wicked Samaritan.<a name=3:18></a> He did not enter into argument about the prejudices of the Jews, or their justice in thus treating their neighbours; His mind was on the one subject -- her salvation; and therefore He needs nothing else.<a name=3:19></a> He answered and said unto her, "If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith unto thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.<a name=3:20></a>" Now 
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		there is the great truth, the ignorance of which ruins the world.<a name=4:1></a> They do not know who it is that is asking them to give Him a drink -- still beseeching them to be reconciled -- "We pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God" -- still entreating them, in terms of the greatest gentleness and love, to give themselves to Him -- still in this character of petitioner for a favour.<a name=4:2></a> The point of distinction which the world knows not is this, that it is the Son of God who thus humbles Himself to ask sinners to come; that it is the Lord of glory doing it -- the Son of the eternal God doing it.<a name=4:3></a> They know not who it is that is asking them, and therefore they ask not from Him that gift without which they never can enter into the kingdom of God.<a name=4:4></a> "If thou knewest .<a name=4:5></a>.<a name=4:6></a>.<a name=4:7></a> who it is that saith to thee, .<a name=4:8></a>.<a name=4:9></a>.<a name=4:10></a> thou wouldest have asked of him.<a name=4:11></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We come then to inquire, What is this gift?<a name=4:12></a> The gift of God.<a name=4:13></a> Living water.<a name=4:14></a> A well of water -- a springing well -- springing up continually into eternal life.<a name=4:15></a> There are just two things to he considered: first, what it is -- namely, the giving of the Holy Spirit; secondly, who it is that gives it -- <i>Christ</i>.<a name=4:16></a> To have known the latter would have been to have asked for the former.<a name=4:17></a> It is the knowledge of whom we have to do with that puts us upon asking for His gifts; for this gift of the Holy Spirit in us (which is Christ's to give) is to be in the believer a well -- always living water -- not a pool, which, though full, may be liable to be dried up, but a well that cannot dry up.<a name=4:18></a> There is the fountain which can never be exhausted that is given to him -- is put into him, and lives and abides for ever.<a name=4:19></a> Now this is the promise to the believer -- "The water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.<a name=4:20></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the possession of this water must consist, first, in the knowledge of the Giver of it: without that there must be total ignorance, darkness, stupidity, and entire inapprehension and inability to recognise or understand the worth or value of the gift, or its spiritual signification.<a name=4:21></a> As in the case before us, the woman's mind took in nothing of this, because she was ignorant of Him with whom she was speaking; her mind could not therefore apprehend the truth, and we see her carnal reason entirely misconstruing it, and turning it into another channel.<a name=4:22></a> "Sir," she said, "thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?<a name=4:23></a>" And here we see what her mind was occupied with
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=5>[Page 5]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		-- the world, the duties, pursuits, and employments of the world; and so she could not rise to any higher thoughts -- could not see who it was that spoke, nor what He was offering to her attention.<a name=5:1></a> And thus blinded is the world, led away from the things of Christ, by the things of time and sense.<a name=5:2></a> Satan uses these things as instruments in his hands of keeping the soul from Christ.<a name=5:3></a> Let it be what it may, let it be only a waterpot, he cares not, so that it occupies the mind to the exclusion of the knowledge of Christ.<a name=5:4></a> He cares not for the instrument, so that he gains his own end, to draw the mind away from the apprehension of spiritual things.<a name=5:5></a> It may be pleasure, it may be amusement, gain, reputation, family duties, lawful employments, so that it keeps the soul from fixing on Christ.<a name=5:6></a> This is all he wants.<a name=5:7></a> A waterpot will serve his purpose, just as well as a palace, so that he can blind them, "lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.<a name=5:8></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I ask you now, my friends, Is there nothing which is thus keeping you from knowing Christ, and seeing His great salvation -- from giving yourselves up to Him, and obtaining from Him this living water?<a name=5:9></a> It may be harmless -- it may be innocent in itself -- it may even be praiseworthy in itself.<a name=5:10></a> But has it been of sufficient weight with you to keep you from Christ?<a name=5:11></a> Is He a stranger to you?<a name=5:12></a> and are you a stranger to His great gifts?<a name=5:13></a> Is there anything even this day -- no matter what -- family duties, lawful employments -- which has held you?<a name=5:14></a> Perhaps something less harmless and innocent than a waterpot has been found hitherto of sufficient weight with you to keep your soul dead to the spiritual apprehension of Christ's words.<a name=5:15></a> See yourself then in the case of this woman, as far as we have yet considered it.<a name=5:16></a> Her mind was occupied in the purpose for which she came to the well -- a lawful and necessary purpose; and so she had no mind for the things of Christ.<a name=5:17></a> She saw nothing in them but what related to her then employment; she saw not the love, the graciousness, and compassion of the Lord's mind just going to be openly manifested towards her.<a name=5:18></a> There was the Lord of life and glory, weary with His journey, at the well, while His soul was full of thoughts of reconciliation towards her.<a name=5:19></a> But she saw it not; she thought more about her waterpot; it was greater in her estimation than the living water He had been speaking of.<a name=5:20></a> Still pursuing her own carnal train of thought, she continued, "Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?<a name=5:21></a>"

		Jesus answered her, "Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again; but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.<a name=6:1></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now one would have thought that such a powerful truth, from the lips of Truth itself, would have awakened her from her stupid dream, and shewn her that there was more in it than carnal nature could discern.<a name=6:2></a> But no; she saw nothing of it, and replies, "Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.<a name=6:3></a>" The natural mind is on natural things, and sees everything through that medium; it is shut up in its own little circle of feelings and ideas, and can neither see nor feel beyond it; there it looks for all its enjoyment; there it lives, there it continues, and there it dies.<a name=6:4></a> "The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, neither can he know them, for they are spiritually discerned"; and the reason is this -- they have neither seen nor know the God in whose presence they are, neither have they ever been partakers by faith in Christ of God's gift of the Holy Spirit, whereby they discern spiritually; they have no perception of the excluded state in which they are with regard to God and heaven; neither do they know anything of the entrance into the new life -- the new creation, because the entrance of the Spirit has never been experienced in their hearts, they are foolish and worldly and know nothing of God.<a name=6:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But notwithstanding all this we see the perseverance of our God.<a name=6:6></a> In spite of all the stupidity of this sinful Samaritan, the Lord still continues His labour of love, though exhibited differently.<a name=6:7></a> He now changes His manner.<a name=6:8></a> But the patience of the Lord of love is never wearied by the obstinate perverseness of His people.<a name=6:9></a> We, judging from our own feelings, might well suppose the Saviour would have left her in dark stupidity, and have given her up.<a name=6:10></a> But no; He is God, and not man: therefore we are not left to our own blindness.<a name=6:11></a> The patience of His love is never exhausted, for it proceeds from an inexhaustible source: "God is love.<a name=6:12></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Saviour now takes another course in His wisdom; but the end is still the same -- <i>love</i>.<a name=6:13></a> He had tried expostulation and entreaty, but she could not understand Him.<a name=6:14></a> He therefore

		says, "Go, call thy husband"; you are proof against all I have offered you; you cannot understand My motive and My meaning of love, so I must make you get a view of yourself -- of your ruin -- of your utter wretchedness.<a name=7:1></a> In this one sentence her little world of iniquity was unravelled to her mind.<a name=7:2></a> He brought her to the consciousness of what she was, and to the knowledge of what He was.<a name=7:3></a> She answers, "Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.<a name=7:4></a>" The secrets of her heart and life were laid open to her by One whom she had never seen before.<a name=7:5></a> The Lord struck the chord to the conscience of the sinner -- it vibrated.<a name=7:6></a> The Stranger convinced her of what she never before in reality believed -- that she was a sinner.<a name=7:7></a> He laid open what she had so carefully concealed, stripped her of her self-disguise, and shewed her that He was acquainted with the hidden recesses of her heart.<a name=7:8></a> And such ever follows the testimony of the truth, when brought home with power to the soul of the sinner.<a name=7:9></a> "He is convinced of all, he is judged of all; and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so, falling down on his face, he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth.<a name=7:10></a>" And it is thus the Lord acts generally, before we come to the distinct apprehension that we are in the presence of One who has the keys of our conscience, and knows the secrets of our hearts, in whose hands we cannot struggle or wrestle for relief; we are judged, we are convinced, we are dumb before Him; we feel His power, and are constrained to cry, "Come, see a man that told me all that ever I did.<a name=7:11></a>" Even while there is no manifest perception of the blessing offered, yet the soul is brought to see and feel the power of Him with whom it has to do; that He who searches the heart and finds out our sin comes in the power of God, and that it is vain for us to dissemble with Him.<a name=7:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Her mind is now taken off from her waterpot, and she inquires where she was to worship God.<a name=7:13></a> Much might be said of the reply here given to her on the worship God alone requires -- spiritual worship.<a name=7:14></a> The whole instruction of God's Spirit as to communion with Him is brought out here.<a name=7:15></a> But we pass on to the consideration of the blessed end of their converse.<a name=7:16></a> Her mind was now opening to the light.<a name=7:17></a> She was approaching to the knowledge of Him, whom to know is everlasting life, and she appears looking forward to the time when the Redeemer is to reveal himself.<a name=7:18></a> The Spirit leads her to say, "I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ; when he is come, he will tell us all things.<a name=7:19></a> Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.<a name=7:20></a>"

		Now trace these steps, brethren, and you will see the perfect blessedness and graciousness of the way in which she was brought to know Christ.<a name=8:1></a> Though a vile sinner, stupid and heedless of the wonderful blessings He was holding out to her, not one word of anger, not one word of reproach, passes the Lord's lips.<a name=8:2></a> He brought her sin to her remembrance -- "Thou hast well said, I have no husband.<a name=8:3></a>" He leads her to desire the revelation of the Messiah, and then, in a way the most engaging and the most insinuating, He makes Himself known unto her.<a name=8:4></a> There is not one of us, if the Lord were thus to unveil our minds, but would be ready to fly from ourselves and seek Jesus.<a name=8:5></a> But we see not our state by nature; we are too busy -- too much occupied with the cares, duties, engagements, and pleasures of the world, to see ourselves as we really are.<a name=8:6></a> We are too much occupied with our waterpot to know the Lord of glory seated at the well.<a name=8:7></a> But let the truth be brought to ourselves, then even the world, self-lover as it is, will hate itself.<a name=8:8></a> In what a way of love was she brought!<a name=8:9></a> no reproach, no harshness, no unkind word.<a name=8:10></a> He simply opens up her heart, next creates the desire to know Him, and then exclaims, "I that speak unto thee am he.<a name=8:11></a>" Here she now found what her soul was looking for.<a name=8:12></a> She might have some possible hope that He was coming; but how could she expect to see Him so full of humility and love as to become a suitor for a drink of cold water?<a name=8:13></a> This is the very way and manner in which Christ reveals Himself to any soul before that soul asks anything of Him.<a name=8:14></a> It is in this very position that we are able to ask anything of Him.<a name=8:15></a> It is in this way of dealing that we find Christ in all gentleness, all love, all condescension to our weakness and unworthiness.<a name=8:16></a> He shews us something of the greatness of His power in knowing our hearts; and then leads us to the point of blessedness when He reveals Himself -- "I am he.<a name=8:17></a>" The sinner can then ask from the Lord, whom he has seen willing to be a debtor for kindness; he hears Him exclaim, I do not feel at enmity with you; I am not about to reproach you; and to shew you this, I will entreat a favour at your hands, and am ready to give you what you shall ask of Me -- the best gift -- the gift of God.<a name=8:18></a>

		THE TEN VIRGINS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Matthew 25: 1-13
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are just two classes of characters which we meet with in the world: first, those who have never heard the way of truth and salvation, and in consequence are not manifestly interested in it; and, secondly, those who have heard and professed to receive it.<a name=12:1></a> But the principles of the latter individually are very different.<a name=12:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The general character of the one part is summed up in the charge brought from scripture -- "they profess that they know God, while in works they deny him"; while the others are really and in truth waiting for His Son from heaven and the kingdom of God.<a name=12:3></a> This is what they desire visibly to behold, as is declared in John 3:3, "Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God"; and to be brought into it -- as in verse 5, "Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.<a name=12:4></a>" The perception therefore of this kingdom, and the entrance therein, arise manifestly from their being "born again.<a name=12:5></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Many are inclined to look upon the new birth, which is here referred to, as a change of views, desires, and sentiments only.<a name=12:6></a> It is a change, if indeed that can be called a change which is an entirely new creation; as it is written, "created anew in Christ Jesus"; it is a "translation" -- "hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son" -- a transferring, a putting into a different position, which the Gospel of Matthew strikingly brings before us.<a name=12:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord Jesus is represented in different points of view by all the evangelists; and the reason the Holy Ghost has been thus pleased to exhibit Him is for the manifestation and furtherance of the Saviour's glory; for He fills up every blessing -- all the greatness, wisdom, love, and power of the eternal Godhead are unfolded in Him.<a name=12:8></a> <i>In</i> Him dwells all blessedness, and <i>from</i> Him it is communicated; and the believer, who has found and known Him, finds Him to be such; his delight is in setting his mind on Christ; he feels and rejoices in his identification with Him in all things, and in his oneness with Him.<a name=12:9></a> Christ is his centre of attraction, and he is revolving round Him as the object of supreme delight.<a name=12:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=13>[Page 13]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the Gospel of John presents Christ to our view as the Son, and delineates all His offices and works as such, having authority, and exercising it as the Son.<a name=13:1></a> Luke displays Him as the last Adam -- the Lord from heaven -- tracing His genealogy, not downwards as Matthew, but ascending to the great original thus, "which was the son of Adam, which was the son of God," going about doing good continually and accomplishing all righteousness.<a name=13:2></a> And in Matthew we have Him exhibited as the Messiah, the object of the prophecies, the substance of the shadows and types of the Jewish ritual: and as He was the looked-for seed, typified of old, and promised to Abraham and David as their seed, so we have in this Gospel His descent from Abraham and David according to the flesh.<a name=13:3></a> But the mention of the kingdom of heaven is peculiar to this evangelist.<a name=13:4></a> In chapter 13 we have it much noticed: "To you it is given," said Jesus, speaking to His disciples, "to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven.<a name=13:5></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the disciples, in common with the whole Jewish nation, fully expected an earthly kingdom; but, as they had entirely overlooked those prophecies which foretold Christ's coming in humiliation, they were bewildered; and therefore this subject with which the Lord engrossed their minds just met their necessities; shewing them how the kingdom in mystery would be set up during the absence of their rejected Lord.<a name=13:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the period of the kingdom here referred to must be looked upon as the time of the development of the purposes of God, from His rejection by the world in the Person of His Son, to Christ's coming again in glory, when the righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father -- a kingdom into which they are admitted, and none else.<a name=13:7></a> And this shews us the complete, entire disunion and dissociation of the children of God with the world.<a name=13:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What is the position of the world as it now stands?<a name=13:9></a> What is its natural positive position?<a name=13:10></a> It is in a state, not merely of hostility against God -- not merely in its standing chargeable with alienation from all holiness, of open rebellion and outrage -- but in a state of absolute exclusion from the presence of God, absolutely and definitely excluded from God's presence.<a name=13:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The word of God says, "He drove out the man.<a name=13:12></a>" He had lost his innocence and purity, and was no longer fit to live in an innocent world.<a name=13:13></a> A plain precept had been given, and wilfully, in defiance of God, broken.<a name=13:14></a> The matter of fact as to

		eating the fruit was simple, but involved momentous consequences.<a name=14:1></a> Even the fact of its abstract littleness heightened the culpability of the offence; the action, looked at in itself, was trivial, and yet it was the extent of every possible indignity which, under existing circumstances, could be offered to the majesty of heaven.<a name=14:2></a> The less the motive and inducement to sin, the greater is the guilt of it.<a name=14:3></a> Such however was man's depravity; and the world, as we now see it, is the result of such sin.<a name=14:4></a> Man sinned, and God drove out the man, because in his then state he could not dwell in His presence; "and he placed at the east of the garden cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.<a name=14:5></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this excluded state is the world with which we are conversant -- full of toil, sorrow, sin, and misery.<a name=14:6></a> But the evil was not of God, it did not originate in Him -- this was not God's doing.<a name=14:7></a> But after this delinquency and exclusion was there no reaction -- no return to purity?<a name=14:8></a> <i>No</i>!<a name=14:9></a> -- the world was never again to be an innocent world; what had once become radically guilty could never again become radically pure; the very source of innocence, being once defiled, could not by any possibility become again holy.<a name=14:10></a> Innocence, once lost, is lost for ever.<a name=14:11></a> Man could do nothing.<a name=14:12></a> God would indeed come to put away sin; but how?<a name=14:13></a> By the sacrifice of His own dear Son, bringing in a new dispensation of unbounded mercy, and setting up a kingdom, and gathering out of the world the subjects of this new dispensation.<a name=14:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The world had sinned, but was not left there.<a name=14:15></a> God manifested Himself, and made known His purposes; first, to Adam, when He called him -- "Where art thou?<a name=14:16></a>" and brought his sin before him; then in the calling out of the world, and preserving Noah, the type of the church, after the flood; His calling of Abraham and the Jewish nation, giving laws, and exhibiting Himself in types and ceremonies as the object of the believer's faith.<a name=14:17></a> At length, when all these displays of superlative love had but more glaringly manifested the total enmity of man's mind, the Lord sent His Son: "I will send my beloved Son; it may be they will reverence him.<a name=14:18></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this stage of the world we behold man, as it were, in a fresh position of more determined enmity and fiercer malignity, in league with Satan, and full of deadly animosity.<a name=14:19></a> The world's feeling now is, "This is the heir; come, let us kill him.<a name=14:20></a>"
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And when was this foul principle exhibited?<a name=15:1></a> When the Lord comes in sympathetic mercy to meet the wants and bear away the sins of His people.<a name=15:2></a> It was <i>then</i> they declared they would not have Him.<a name=15:3></a> When He comes to reconcile, and to display the tenderness of His sympathetic love, then nothing would do but they must get rid of God.<a name=15:4></a> When He comes into the very midst of the sufferings and woes of a world lying in wickedness, they refuse to have Him.<a name=15:5></a> He was God, and therefore (as far as man could do it) they turned Him out of the world.<a name=15:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in this last act of man we do not see simply rebellion, or even defiance, but absolute rejection of God.<a name=15:7></a> They used the opportunity of His humiliation to heap indignity and scorn upon Him; and at length, as far as they were concerned, drove Him out of the world in which we are now dwelling.<a name=15:8></a> "We will not have this man to reign over us" is practically its determination.<a name=15:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now believers are associated, in thought, feeling, affection, and interest, with Him who is the object of the world's determined enmity; they are subjects of another kingdom and another King; the King whom the world will not have to reign over them is the King they own and serve.<a name=15:10></a> They see that the world which surrounds them is a judged world; that it has been convicted of rejecting all right and truth; as our Lord Himself says, "Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the prince of this world be cast out.<a name=15:11></a>" The judgment was passed when Christ exclaimed, "It is finished"; in the very act of His crucifixion was their judgment sealed.<a name=15:12></a> The most determined and inveterate enmity of man against God was at its height on the cross of Christ; man's malice could go no farther, and God's love was there also manifested in the highest degree.<a name=15:13></a> Sin abounded, but love much more abounded; the very act which exhibited enmity of the deepest dye on man's part opened the highest love on God's.<a name=15:14></a> Here they met, as it were, in a centre -- at a point, each drawn to the greatest possible extent; and here love obtained the victory, triumphed over sin, and brought in everlasting righteousness.<a name=15:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And this judgment of the world is known to all believers; yea, the Holy Ghost Himself convinces them of it.<a name=15:16></a> "When the Comforter is come, he shall reprove [or convince] the world of sin," said Christ; "of righteousness, and of judgment .<a name=15:17></a>.<a name=15:18></a>.<a name=15:19></a> because the prince of this world is judged.<a name=15:20></a>" So that they are

	<div class="paragraph">
		convinced they lived in a judged world, a world found guilty of, and condemned for, rejecting God, but on which sentence has not as yet been executed.<a name=16:1></a> It is now just in the position between sentence having been passed and the final execution.<a name=16:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the very act which thus displays man's rage the believer sees also his own perfect acceptance; that God, in whom he delights, and in whom he rests, has risen in mercy above man's depravity and triumphed in love over the bitterest hatred.<a name=16:3></a> The summit of malevolence the most abominable, when the Saviour's side was pierced, was met by a tide of blood and of water, to sanctify and to purify the unclean: this is the glory, the blessedness, of the child of God.<a name=16:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But from the parable before us of the ten virgins we necessarily perceive that there are those who, though associated with the people of God in profession and outwardly appearing to belong to them, are not in reality alive to God.<a name=16:5></a> They appear to be looking for His coming, but they are not longing to behold Him or to go in with Him to the marriage.<a name=16:6></a> It is not the earnest desire of their hearts to behold Him as He is; their souls have not gone forth, crying, Come, Lord Jesus, come quickly.<a name=16:7></a> They more resemble those servants who exclaimed, "My Lord delayeth his coming," and then followed on in their own pleasure.<a name=16:8></a> But they know not the delight, the joy, the heavenly happiness of waiting in longing expectation to see His face, and dwell with Him for ever!<a name=16:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But we have in this account of the ten virgins an evidence of the extent to which even outward profession may go.<a name=16:10></a> Though there were but five wise, yet they all went forth to meet the bridegroom -- yes, ostensibly for the same purpose, they all "went forth.<a name=16:11></a>" They were alike in companionship; they had all the lamps of profession.<a name=16:12></a> In what then did they differ?<a name=16:13></a> In this: they had not just the one thing, the only thing, that fitted them to receive the bridegroom.<a name=16:14></a> They were without the light wherewith to usher in the Lord; they wanted the very thing which alone could make them suitable companions for the Master; namely, the participation of the divine nature, the impartation of light, the indwelling of God the Holy Ghost.<a name=16:15></a> They wanted the fixedness of the affections wrought in the soul by the oil of gladness, the unction of the Spirit, which filled the souls of the wise virgins, and which waited but for the appearance of the bridegroom to emanate in a flame of glory.<a name=16:16></a> This was what they wanted; this is what

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"At midnight the cry came": the heavenly virgins arose.<a name=17:2></a> Though conscious of much weakness in themselves, they rise at the cry of their beloved; for there is that in them which answers to the cry.<a name=17:3></a> The foolish virgins trimmed their lamps; but their lamps failed to burn!<a name=17:4></a> And is there no remedy then?<a name=17:5></a> None!<a name=17:6></a> According to the Saviour's awful declaration: "He that is unjust, let him be unjust still; and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still.<a name=17:7></a>"

		Here finishes the total distinction between the tares and the wheat.<a name=17:8></a> Now it is openly seen that their objects, hopes, and associations were totally different -- opposite and irreconcilable.<a name=17:9></a> One is of the world, the other of God; one is quickened by Christ, the other is reserved to be burned.<a name=17:10></a> "Bind the tares in bundles, and burn them; but gather the wheat into my garner.<a name=17:11></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And why are the wheat still spared, but as witnesses of the grace of our Lord; to display to the world the image of Him, whose they are, and whom they serve; to manifest the inseparable union existing between them and their glorious Head, as He said Himself, "that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them as thou hast loved me"?<a name=17:12></a>

		John 7: 37-39
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In order fully to understand the meaning of this scripture, and the circumstance for which this feast, to which Jesus went up, is a type, we must, in the first place, see the way in which He is presented to us in Scripture -- at present as an absent Lord.<a name=19:1></a> Under an anticipated sense of this absence we find Him comforting His disciples, "Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me"; consequent upon that discourse with His disciples, wherein He says, "Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now, but thou shalt follow me afterwards.<a name=19:2></a>" And when Peter under a dread of that absence, exclaimed, "Lord, why, cannot I follow thee now?<a name=19:3></a>" Jesus says, "Let not your heart be troubled.<a name=19:4></a>" You shall not enjoy My bodily presence, it is true; but, though absent, believe in Me.<a name=19:5></a> Ye believe in God without seeing Him; now believe also in Me: though I go away from you, I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man takes from you.<a name=19:6></a> Here, then, is now the position of the believer.<a name=19:7></a> Jesus has gone, and the believer stands in the apprehension of His absence; his desires are tending toward an absent Lord.<a name=19:8></a> He feels his joy still incomplete, because his Beloved is not present; and he is looking for and hastening towards the time when He is to be revealed, and we shall "see him as he is.<a name=19:9></a>" But he knows at present he is not where Christ is; he is in a usurped world, where Satan is setting up his kingdom, whose subjects are described as saying, "I sit as queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.<a name=19:10></a>" Here is nothing of the consciousness of the Lord's absence as felt by the church -- no cry for deliverance -- no cry for the Lord to come; no such thing as saying, "In this [body] we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven.<a name=19:11></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here we have the character of those who are members of Christ's body.<a name=19:12></a> They are such as have an habitual consciousness that their Lord is absent, that the adversary is present, and that they themselves are in a world which rejected their Lord and is under the usurped dominion of their adversary.<a name=19:13></a> Hence they are looking for "a new heaven and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.<a name=19:14></a>" And they are believers, who are not looking to receive their portion here from the persons and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two cities referred to in Scripture.<a name=20:4></a> Paul says, in the name of all believers, "Here we have no continuing city, but we seek one to come.<a name=20:5></a>" And believers are conscious that they are where the "city is low in a low place.<a name=20:6></a>" The other city is "the city of confusion," or Babylon, which are synonymous terms; this is quite distinct from that city which we seek.<a name=20:7></a> The city of confusion, or Babel, cannot then bear any analogy to this city: they are not -- they cannot be -- united.<a name=20:8></a> They are the two opposite corporate systems, irrespective of each other, and opposed to each other.<a name=20:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is this testimony of the Spirit in the hearts of believers, that, though surrounded with "Great Babylon," it is not the city to the laws of which they owe or practise obedience; that <i>their</i> city is the "city of God" -- the manifestation of which they are looking for.<a name=20:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The believer is conscious that, if he is living bodily in this "city of confusion," he has really by the Spirit "come unto Mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God.<a name=20:11></a>" It is to this he belongs; of this city he is a citizen, and for the visible perception of this he is hastening onwards.<a name=20:12></a> The Spirit testifies that he has now the visible perception of the other system, dwelling there, but not as belonging to it; but as waiting for that time when "he that shall come will come and will not tarry," who will then overthrow the dominion of Satan, and reign for ever!<a name=20:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But, besides the absence of the Lord, which this scripture infers, it also evidences the presence of the Holy Ghost with such as do groan under a sense of widowhood (that is, while they are in the wilderness, before coming to the land of Canaan), and particularly points to the latter times, just previous to the coming of Christ, when the outpouring of the Spirit should be peculiarly manifested.<a name=20:14></a>

		The feast of tabernacles had not been, nor could it be, kept in the wilderness; and it is one of the remarkable types which manifestly have not yet been fulfilled.<a name=21:6></a> This was the third of the three great annual feasts which the Jews held in commemoration of some great event.<a name=21:7></a> The time when this was first kept was after their entering into the land of Canaan.<a name=21:8></a> The very circumstances of it shewed that it could not be kept in the wilderness.<a name=21:9></a> It was to continue for seven days, and also on the eighth day, which was to be a great sabbath.<a name=21:10></a> It was to be kept in memorial that they had dwelt in tents; that they had been in the wilderness but were now out of it.<a name=21:11></a> It was a day of solemn assembly -- the ingathering, the acknowledgment that, though they had been "strangers and pilgrims," or wanderers in a foreign country, yet now they were settled in the land whither they had been journeying all the time they had been in the wilderness; and therefore we see that this is still an unfulfilled type in the Christian dispensation; for real facts testify, that as the feast of tabernacles could not be kept until they had come out of the wilderness state, it is still to us an unfulfilled type, and that the third great type, which was to witness the gathering of the people to their own land, waits for its final accomplishment.<a name=21:12></a>

		The feast of the passover, which commemorated the deliverance of the Israelites from Egyptian bondage by the slaying of the lamb and the sprinkling of blood, and prefigured the redemption of the church by the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ, has been accomplished, as far as the absolute fact of His death and satisfaction for sin, in raising us from more than Egyptian bondage.<a name=21:13></a> The results have not indeed, nor will

	<div class="paragraph">
		The feast of weeks, or Pentecost, an offering of thanksgiving to the Lord for the increase of the firstfruits of the harvest, has had, so far as the absolute fact, a plain fulfilment, when the first-fruits of the Christian church were seen -- the manifestation of the increase of the Spirit in His descent on the disciples on the day of Pentecost -- the first-fruits of the finished work of Christ.<a name=22:3></a> Here it has been in part fulfilled.<a name=22:4></a> The results have not all been accomplished; the effects are still going and will continue to go on, though it has had in some measure its positive and ostensible accomplishment.<a name=22:5></a> But in no sense has the type of the feast of tabernacles been fulfilled; it remains yet to be accomplished, when the true Israelites, having left the wilderness, are brought into their own land, and commemorate with loud praises their blessed entrance.<a name=22:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The circumstances which occurred at these feasts prove also the fact of their fulfilment.<a name=22:7></a> In the time of the passover, and the feast accompanying it, there was to be offered a lamb, without blemish or spot, and on the morrow after the sabbath an unbroken offering, a sheaf of the first-fruits, exactly answering to Christ's sacrifice of Himself, as a lamb without any blemish, and presenting at His resurrection an unbroken offering -- "the first-fruits of them that slept.<a name=22:8></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, at the feast of Pentecost, an offering was made of two wave loaves, mixed with leaven: and in the fulfilment of this type we see the wonderful contrast between it and that offered on the day of atonement.<a name=22:9></a> The Spirit descended on the disciples in the realisation of this figure; but, the excellency being put into earthen vessels, it was leavened; that is, it was mixed with the corruption of nature -- therefore, a leavened cake.<a name=22:10></a> Whereas, in the former type, it was not a leavened but an unleavened offering, a sheaf of the first-fruits; wonderfully prefiguring the offering of Him, who had no stain or spot of sin, who saw no corruption, and in whom there was no leaven mixed.<a name=22:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now there would have been no atonement had the paschal lamb been in any way blemished; but being faultless and then sacrificed, it was accepted, in that it was without blemish.<a name=22:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But now, concerning the Lord's going up to this feast of tabernacles which was at hand, and which was confessedly an unfulfilled type, His brethren said to Him, "Depart hence, and go into Judea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.<a name=23:4></a> For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly.<a name=23:5></a> If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world.<a name=23:6></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This was pressed upon Him by His brethren, who did not believe on Him: "Shew thyself to the world" -- exhibit Thyself.<a name=23:7></a> They wanted a manifestation of Himself at that time, adequate to the claims He made; an indiscriminate revelation of Himself to all the world, proposing to Him to shew Himself then.<a name=23:8></a> But Jesus said, "My time is not yet come.<a name=23:9></a>" That was not His time to exhibit Himself openly; but the time is fast approaching, which will be to the joy of His saints, and the terror of the ungodly.<a name=23:10></a> Then will He exhibit Himself, when "every eye shall see him, and they also that pierced him, and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him.<a name=23:11></a>" "Then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory.<a name=23:12></a>" This will be the time when He shall declare Himself openly.<a name=23:13></a> But as yet He has not come to confound the world by the manifestation of Himself openly; and this, to a world lying in wickedness, is mercy -- real longsuffering -- the very height of forbearance; for when He does come, it is to thrust out of His dominion all that offend, all that do iniquity -- all that practise or love sin: and why?<a name=23:14></a> Because He is holiness itself, and He cannot look at sin; and where He is, sin cannot find a place.<a name=23:15></a> And therefore His very coming must sweep, with the bosom of destruction, all the refuges of lies, and everything that is opposed to holiness.<a name=23:16></a> This forbearance therefore is comparative happiness.<a name=23:17></a> And well it is for the saints now, that the Lord did not act on the suggestion of His brethren, and shew Himself then.<a name=23:18></a> Well it is for them that it was not His

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Blessed, very blessed is it, then, for the world, for the saints, and for those who are yet to be gathered in, that the Lord did not shew Himself openly at the feast, "because his time was not yet come.<a name=24:3></a>" He went up however, but secretly.<a name=24:4></a> His very discourse -- "I go not up yet to this feast" -- shewed that it was to have a positive fulfilment, when there would be a consciousness of having been in the wilderness, but now rejoicing in being out of it.<a name=24:5></a> "Shew thyself to the world" was the request of His brethren.<a name=24:6></a> This He refused; but He went up secretly, and taught at the feast, inviting all to come and partake of His mercy, before He should disclose Himself openly.<a name=24:7></a>

		In consequence of the effect the Lord's miracles had made upon the people, the Pharisees were enraged, and sent officers to take Him; and the Lord says, "Yet a little while am I with you.<a name=24:8></a>" There is a peculiar display of affection in this, as if He would call upon them, while they have the light, to believe in it, to walk in it, and so be saved.<a name=24:9></a> And He adds, "Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me.<a name=24:10></a>" There is a time coming when you will be glad to find me; you now seek me in ill-will, in enmity, in malice, but the time will come when you will endeavour to find me from a very different motive.<a name=24:11></a> And He says precisely the same to His disciples, "Ye shall seek me, and, as I said unto the Jews, whither I go, ye cannot come.<a name=24:12></a>" Such, therefore, is the present position of the people of God: they are where Christ manifestly is not; and where He is, there they cannot come as yet.<a name=24:13></a> It is painfully true, it is sorrowfully true, that this is their experience now.<a name=24:14></a> They are not with Jesus, though the Lord in mercy makes it up to them; by the earnest of it which He puts within them, they have the certainty that they shall be with Him.<a name=24:15></a> This is the desire of their souls; this constitutes their hope of glory, to be in the presence of Christ; to see "him who loved them, and washed them from their sins in his own blood"; to "see him as he is," and "to be like him.<a name=24:16></a>"

		This is what we are looking for, if we are believers.<a name=25:1></a> We have, it is true, while here, another Comforter, a blessed Comforter; but His very teaching and instruction leads us to desire more of Him, and more of the Father, and of Jesus; and He sends forth our affections towards Jesus, and leads us to desire His presence; just as here, with sensible objects, where we really love, we are longing to be in the presence of the object; so, the indwelling of the Spirit, who is love, draws out our affections towards Jesus, making us practically and painfully conscious of the present truth of Christ's words, "Whither I go, ye cannot come.<a name=25:2></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, brethren, I ask you, Have you come to the sorrowful acknowledgment and perception of Christ's words?<a name=25:3></a> Are you conscious that you are in a distinct position from the present system of things in this "city of confusion," and that you are <i>opposed</i> to it in affections, desires, and pursuits?<a name=25:4></a> That your affections are carried away to Him who has departed: Him whom the world rejected -- Him whom the world turned out, and left itself in the darkness which it loved?<a name=25:5></a> Are you conscious that the night is far spent?<a name=25:6></a> that the day, the glorious day of His appearing, is at hand?<a name=25:7></a>

		We, brethren, are not of the night, nor of darkness.<a name=25:8></a> But are we walking as children of the light, and of the day?<a name=25:9></a> We know it is the night now, because the "Sun of righteousness" is absent.<a name=25:10></a> His glory is hid, and His beams are seen obscurely even by the keenest spiritual vision.<a name=25:11></a> But are our desires intensely, turned towards the returning light?<a name=25:12></a> Are we waiting for it "more than they that watch for the morning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning"?<a name=25:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The question with our souls, brethren, is, whether there is this apprehension -- this spiritual apprehension, of what the Lord Jesus is to the soul, so as to be sensible of our state at present, as living on an absent Lord?<a name=25:14></a> "While I am in the world, I am the light of the world," said Christ.<a name=25:15></a> Christ, our light, is not visible with us, but He is coming; the day-star may be hid till the day-dawn appears, but then shall "the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings.<a name=25:16></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is what the believer is hastening towards; he is longing for the day -- the night is not his joy -- it is not his happiness.<a name=25:17></a> "They that sleep, sleep in the night"; but he is not of the night, and therefore can get no enjoyment from the things of the night.<a name=25:18></a> But he waits for the day-star -- Him who, though

		This great feast to which the Lord was going up was very memorable to the Jews from the several times of its celebration.<a name=26:3></a> At the time of the completion of Solomon's temple, when nothing more was wanting to finish it -- at that same time was the feast of the seventh month -- "a solemn assembly," in which the people were "joyful and glad of heart.<a name=26:4></a>" Also, on the return of the captives from Babylon into their own land, they discovered by the book of the law that it was the exact period when this feast should be observed; and we find in Nehemiah 8, that it was celebrated with "very great gladness.<a name=26:5></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		For the type to be fulfilled literally and spiritually we must look forward to that time when the spiritual temple will be completed; when every precious stone shall be placed therein, and when "he shall bring forth the head-stone with shoutings, Grace, grace unto it"; and also for that time, when there shall be nothing to keep us from our own home, and when our souls shall be filled with joy and gladness and thanksgiving on getting up out of the wilderness.<a name=26:6></a> But we are <i>not</i> yet there; and therefore the Lord has prepared, and wonderfully given, that which is to be the very comfort and stay of our souls while in this wilderness: "He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.<a name=26:7></a>" Before this is set up in a believer, he has no refreshing perception of union with the living fountain.<a name=26:8></a> What refreshed the children of Israel during their long and toilsome marches through the wilderness?<a name=26:9></a> The command of God went forth to Moses, and upon striking the rock the waters flowed, "the rivers ran in dry places"; they found living waters even in the wilderness.<a name=26:10></a> This was to satisfy them until they came to the desired land.<a name=26:11></a> And so the Lord Jesus was smitten; and from that Rock flow all the living streams which are given for the refreshment and strengthening of His people while here.<a name=26:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In order that the presence of God the Holy Ghost should be thus experienced, Christ absented Himself for a time from His own.<a name=27:8></a> "It is expedient for you," said He, "that I go away; for If I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you"; you knew Him when absent, but you shall shortly have Him dwelling in you, so as to cause you to flow forth in living water.<a name=27:9></a> This was the promise He gave on the last day of the feast -- the promise of the Holy Ghost, which "they that believe on him <i>should</i> receive"; given now, as a witness to the ascension of Christ, after having accomplished redemption work (for it is said, "The Holy Ghost was not yet given, because that Jesus was not yet glorified") after He had entered into His rest of eternal glory; which, though it has been confounded with that given at the new birth, is nevertheless perfectly distinct from it.<a name=27:10></a> For Paul clearly states this to the Galatians, when he says, "Because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts"; not to make, but because ye <i>are</i> sons already.<a name=27:11></a> Therefore, you should enjoy present fellowship with the Father and the Son in glory, by the indwelling of the Holy Ghost, whose powerful presence would lead the soul to the enjoyment of the unseen realities of glory which He testifies within; leading, also, to the contemplation of the Person,

	<div class="paragraph">
		This was consequent upon Jesus being glorified -- "In whom also, after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise": and it was not an influence externally, but was within them, dwelling in them: "Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in you?<a name=28:2></a>" And His personality is also declared: "Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed.<a name=28:3></a>"

		GOD SPEAKING FROM HEAVEN
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hebrews 12: 25
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle, in addressing this exhortation to the Hebrews, acted upon the ground of the character is which Christ spoke, and the consequences resulting therefrom.<a name=32:1></a> Observe: His character is specifically brought forward as speaking "from heaven," contrasted with His character as speaking on earth: "If they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth [that is, when He spake from mount Sinai, thundering out His righteous law], much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven" -- speaketh from the right hand of God, in the midst of His glory.<a name=32:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here is the contrast: Christ, as speaking now from heaven, and then on earth; an awful warning to transgressors, by the evidence of what then happened, to effect much more: "Whose voice <i>then</i> shook the earth.<a name=32:3></a>" This having occurred sanctions the word spoken, which says, "Yet once more I shake not the earth only but also heaven; and this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made.<a name=32:4></a>" And those things, dear friends, are what the saint is in now -- not <i>of</i> them, but <i>in</i> them.<a name=32:5></a> Therefore is he, thus surrounded, warned not to turn away from Him "that speaketh from heaven.<a name=32:6></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This then is the ground on which he stands.<a name=32:7></a> On the one hand, he sees the full blessedness -- the unqualified hope -- which this voice, speaking from heaven, makes known to him; and, on the other hand, he sees there is nothing else to rest upon but the word of Jesus, which is perfectly stable in that it has been tried and proved.<a name=32:8></a> This cannot be removed or shaken; everything, no matter what, that is not in association with this, being liable to be shaken, shall be removed.<a name=32:9></a> When the voice speaks from heaven for the removal of all that opposes it, all that is not of this heavenly character must go.<a name=32:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This same speaking then implies the deep blessedness of the believer, and his not having anything else to rest on but Jesus; not merely to rest on Jesus in the way of righteousness, but for all things -- for everything; for all else is in opposition to God, and when the time of this speaking closes, all that is not of grace goes.<a name=32:11></a> "He then shook the earth.<a name=32:12></a>" Tremendous

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here we have the character of the dispensation to which we, as believers, are called; it is spoken nominally of all the professing church, though only true of those who are alive to God.<a name=33:8></a> They have come to this; their warrant is, that this voice has spoken to them from heaven, and that they have heard it, and that it is the voice of Jesus.<a name=33:9></a> Thus He is presented, as having entered into His glory, and from thence speaking.<a name=33:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus then we learn from this word that this same Jesus who spake on earth is now speaking from heaven.<a name=33:11></a> "Who is he that ascended but he also that descended first into the lower parts of the earth?<a name=33:12></a>" The Lord Jesus is speaking specially, as having effected the entire accomplishment of all that His people failed in, and that could in any degree militate against their happiness.<a name=33:13></a> This voice tells us that it is the same Person, the same Christ who was humbled for our sins; who went through the world, weary and sorrowful; the same man who was crucified, dead, buried, raised, and ascended, that now speaks from heaven, as having passed through all these, and is now at the right hand of God, from whence He is inviting His people up thither.<a name=33:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This then is the joy of the child of God, when he hears this voice of Jesus addressing him from heaven, testifying of what He <i>has</i> done, and speaking as a witness of peace; speaking in the consciousness of having so overcome -- so entirely to have borne the sin of His people as to set it aside for ever by the one sacrifice of Himself once offered.<a name=33:15></a> And in this position He speaks -- I have set aside for ever the sin which kept you excluded from God; and I am entered into the rest and glory, as your representative, in the presence of the Father.<a name=33:16></a> When this voice is heard and known, we have peace.<a name=33:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When the Lord Jesus therefore speaks from heaven, He speaks of having accomplished all the work which the Father gave Him to do.<a name=33:18></a> He speaks in the consciousness of this; and He gives us the consciousness of the same in the power of the

		Spirit, when He visits us individually.<a name=34:1></a> He, the Redeemer -- He who stood the bearer of sin -- stood responsible for His people; and by His perfect satisfaction acquitted them entirely.<a name=34:2></a> Now He, having ascended, says, I have done; I tell you, as in the presence of the Father, the result of all the work I accomplished: I am now in the very glory to which I am about to bring you.<a name=34:3></a> Here is the voice with which He speaks; and if ever He speaks from heaven to any soul now, it is just thus.<a name=34:4></a> The voice may be heard very indistinctly indeed; but that is just what the voice declares -- that is the story which Jesus brings to the soul.<a name=34:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a tale of mercy, of boundless, inconceivable mercy.<a name=34:6></a> It may indeed, poor trembling soul, begin with a tale of thy sin.<a name=34:7></a> This is calculated to originate deep thoughts -- deep searchings of heart; but the beginning and end is for peace -- blessed peace!<a name=34:8></a> The voice still continues to speak; to say, those sins are gone -- utterly put away, no more to incur God's wrath; no further requirement to satisfy for them: Jesus has done that.<a name=34:9></a> You may indeed have sorrow still as to <i>this</i> world; for you are in the very midst of that world which crucified and rejected Christ, the Lord of glory.<a name=34:10></a> You are still in that world which displayed its utter and total enmity, even in rejecting the Author of all blessedness.<a name=34:11></a> That the world did, and He triumphed over it.<a name=34:12></a> He was crucified by the world, and He returned to the Father.<a name=34:13></a> What brought Him there, but the total rejection of Him by the world?<a name=34:14></a> There He is now, and speaks.<a name=34:15></a> And what does this voice declare?<a name=34:16></a> Why, that He has no part with the things <i>of</i> the world.<a name=34:17></a> He does not own it.<a name=34:18></a> The world would not own <i>Him</i> when He came in humiliation, and now He will not own <i>it</i> when seated at the right hand of God the Father.<a name=34:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ is now speaking from heaven with the witness of His rejection on earth, but with the full recognition of having passed through it, and triumphed over its most inveterate malice.<a name=34:20></a> This constitutes the blessedness of God's people here; for they see a full salvation.<a name=34:21></a> Christ now speaking from heaven, who once spoke on earth, brings with it the certain evidence of the full accomplishment of all He engaged for.<a name=34:22></a> Nay, more, by His thus speaking from heaven, we, as believers, are privileged to know all that we are come to, even here.<a name=34:23></a> For this voice says, "Ye are come unto Mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem; and to an

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here we have, not only the confidence of acceptance, but the entireness of deliverance; not only as having overcome, but the blessedness to which believers are privileged to come.<a name=35:2></a> Blessed indeed is the portion to which they are called!<a name=35:3></a> A salvation which is already finished for them -- a present salvation!<a name=35:4></a> This voice speaks, not of something which occurred some time ago, or in a distant place; but, when brought with power into the soul, it shews the present realisation of these things.<a name=35:5></a> It brings the soul to say, <i>I am</i> come to these, because <i>He</i> is there.<a name=35:6></a> Thus faith brings near these things.<a name=35:7></a> This then is the conscious position of the believer when under the energy of the Holy Ghost -- the total putting away of all that hindered and dissociated him from that intimate communion with God, to which he is united, and which it is his privilege to enjoy.<a name=35:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All this Jesus speaks from heaven, and therefore His voice is a voice of peace -- peace under all circumstances.<a name=35:9></a> He speaks the same under all the variety of exercises and trials of this mortal life.<a name=35:10></a> We may be bowed down, and think hard things of ourselves: but there Jesus sits in the calmness of conscious victory, and His words are <i>only</i> words of peace.<a name=35:11></a> Persecution, affliction, and woe, may speak from earth; yet the voice from heaven speaks <i>nothing</i> but peace.<a name=35:12></a> The voice of the Lord Jesus is a voice of peace and conscious rest.<a name=35:13></a> Whatever conflicts with this peace is not in or from Jesus.<a name=35:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This position of the Christian is his perfect identity in spirit with Jesus as He now is: "Bone of his bones, and flesh of his flesh," and therefore He can well sympathise with us.<a name=35:15></a> We may be tempted, harassed, oppressed; but, notwithstanding that, we are really come to "the things which cannot be shaken.<a name=35:16></a>" "He that is joined to the Lord is one spirit.<a name=35:17></a>" This may indeed be but dimly seen here, but it is not less real, and it is known to be real, by the power of the Spirit dwelling in them that believe.<a name=35:18></a> They see the "old man," in their weaknesses which they have crucified, and now are raised, according to the power of the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection of Jesus from the dead.<a name=35:19></a> Christ, our Saviour, is a risen and ascended Saviour; and He now speaks from heaven, as a pledge that

	<div class="paragraph">
		Moreover He so pleased the very mind of God, having performed <i>all</i> His will, that therefore He can say, It is done -- it is accomplished -- it is finished for ever.<a name=36:2></a> Thus He now speaks from heaven one whole testimony of peace; it must necessarily be the voice of peace, bringing in the blessedness of the results of that which brought peace.<a name=36:3></a> It is <i>only</i> of peace then that He speaks, whether it is heard or not.<a name=36:4></a> As Paul says, "and came and preached peace to them which were afar off, and to them that were nigh.<a name=36:5></a>" Christ wrought sorrowfully, even to the death of the cross, to obtain this peace for His people; and now He proclaims it.<a name=36:6></a> Man knew not peace while at enmity with his Maker; and so the Lord Jesus undertook the whole responsibility attaching to His people, and has overcome all impediments to obtain their peace.<a name=36:7></a> And this is the only way true peace can be obtained -- this is what Jesus died to obtain, and, having obtained, now testifies to the truth and certainty of it.<a name=36:8></a> See then that your eyes are fixed on Him that speaks from heaven: else you never can obtain peace; for, in very deed, it is the word of God.<a name=36:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ now sits in heaven proclaiming peace, which brings before us the unspeakable blessedness of the manifestation of the prerogative of God's love against the extent of man's sin, not only in His excelling greatness triumphing over it, but being made the sacrifice Himself, so putting it away.<a name=36:10></a> We come now to see the stability of God's promise, and the certainty of its accomplishment: "Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.<a name=36:11></a> And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made.<a name=36:12></a>" We have seen the association with Jesus into which we are brought, and are come to things spiritual, which, being stable, and resting on the security of God's word, cannot be removed when all else shall be shaken.<a name=36:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the word, "Yet once more," we have a remarkable expression, for it comes to us as a promise on the authority of God; it presses itself upon one's spirit, and bears witness to the truth in the power of the Holy Ghost; it comes to us as a promised truth.<a name=37:9></a> Now let us consider whether Jesus has so spoken to us from heaven, as to lead us to thank God that He has promised this from heaven -- that in truth we believe the promise, and are looking for the accomplishment of it.<a name=37:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The believer therefore rests on these two grounds: that the Lord Jesus Christ is thus speaking to <i>him</i> from heaven -- speaking peace, and therefore taking away all fear, as regards himself, in the promised convulsion and upturning of all things, and also that the promise of God shall stand, in the setting aside of all that shall not participate in his present glory.<a name=38:8></a> Here we see the total dissociation of all and everything connected with an interest in the things of this world: that they are opposed to the things of God -- they are quite distinct, and never can be united.<a name=38:9></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is in the weakness and wants of His children that God's manner of love is even more drawn out, as the Father of a family: the affections of a parent are the same for all his children, but under different circumstances is differently manifested: the long and weak childhood of a child calls forth all the tender sympathy and watchful care of a parent, and knits the affections of a child to him.<a name=42:3></a> So the Lord, amidst our weakness and infantine helplessness, guards us, watches over us; and thus we come to learn the <i>manner</i> of God's love.<a name=42:4></a> Then, as we advance under the watchful care and training, and arrive towards maturity, we learn the blessedness of His love, and we come to discern how the Lord opens out the knowledge of Himself, putting us into a position of wondrous blessedness.<a name=42:5></a> "Henceforth I call you not servants, for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth; but I have called you friends, for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.<a name=42:6></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is the manner and blessedness of God's love to us; and if the believer is insensible to this, he is in a sadly low state; for nothing so much evidences the soul's not being in a healthful state, as to be insensible to the manner of God's love toward us, to be engrossed with what is about us here, and not to be sensible that we are nearer to God than we are even to the circumstances in which we are placed.<a name=42:7></a> How wondrous to behold God taking pleasure in opening out His mind and His plans to man!<a name=42:8></a> which we see evidenced in this thirteenth chapter of Matthew, as in the explanation to His disciples of the parables spoken to the multitude.<a name=42:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We find here seven parables, which have been before noticed, but the order of which it would be well to remark again.<a name=42:10></a> The first parable is not a comparison or likeness of the kingdom of heaven, as the others, but a declaration of the agency of the kingdom, and of its particular results -- the act described as being incidental to the Son of man before His ascension, and its results also, such as might be exhibited in individuals before as well as after it.<a name=42:11></a> The kingdom of heaven

	<div class="paragraph">
		was subsequent to this, and consequent on Christ's resurrection, when a new system of things was about to be established.<a name=43:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The other six parables were not spoken at the same time: three were addressed to the multitude, and three to the disciples alone.<a name=43:2></a> Of these the first three exhibit the public character and result of this kingdom in the world; and the last three symbolised its intrinsic value, and the full development and results in God's hands.<a name=43:3></a> The former fully developed its ostensible and visible manifestation as seen in the world, and the latter, the real value of the thing itself as known in the mind of God.<a name=43:4></a> This expression, "kingdom of heaven," as well as "the kingdom of your Father," is peculiar to the Gospel of Matthew, the Gospel more especially of dispensation and prophetic testimony.<a name=43:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In what situation then is the believer while here?<a name=43:6></a> Holding communion with an absent Lord in heaven -- brought into His family here -- into His kingdom, and taught, not to look for blessings simply upon earth during his Lord's absence, but to look for a time when His saints shall know Him even as they are known, and shall never be absent from Him.<a name=43:7></a> That is what they are looking for, and into that situation they have been brought as the "good seed," partakers of the grace of that "corn of wheat," which fell into the ground and died, that they might live.<a name=43:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"The kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that sowed good seed in his field.<a name=43:9></a>" And from verses 24-30 and 36-45, we have the parable and its signification, as explained by the Lord Himself.<a name=43:10></a> These things speak their own meaning: therefore they are simply brought before us as matters of fact.<a name=43:11></a> He says, as putting any other construction aside, "The field is the world.<a name=43:12></a>" In these parabolical expressions there is a perfect harmony and conformity of meaning: if we can clearly ascertain the meaning by scripture light in one, we can readily imagine the same meaning of the same word in any other place.<a name=43:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now our Saviour said expressly, "The field is the world": this is its meaning, and no other, which brings before us the theatre or the scene where the transaction recorded here takes place -- "the world.<a name=43:14></a>" It presents us with the view of a person sowing good seed in his field; he that sowed the good seed is the Son of man, the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=43:15></a> He sowed it.<a name=43:16></a> It was good seed He sowed, and He sowed it in His field; and

	<div class="paragraph">
		this is the world.<a name=44:1></a> He was entitled to this field; it belonged to Him.<a name=44:2></a> This then is the simple fact: the world was the field; the field belonged to Jesus, and He sowed good seed in it -- something that had not previously been in it -- a something planted which was not indigenous to the soil.<a name=44:3></a> Manifestly then it could not be the Jewish nation or system, for that was placed previous to the period, here alluded to, of the work of the Son of man.<a name=44:4></a> The world which is here mentioned is spoken of as a place, not where the seed had been sown and grown up, but where good seed, not yet planted, was now to be put in; and this then is in the world.<a name=44:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let the child of God now look around him, and see whether (with the exception of those who have been manifestly brought into this new system) he sees anything of this good seed in the world; does it look like a field sown with good seed?<a name=44:6></a> In how far it resembles it, those who know the character of such as now possess the world can best tell.<a name=44:7></a> The world then is His -- the Son of man's field.<a name=44:8></a> Thus this baffles the wisdom and power of those who pretend to claim any portion of it as their own, and who seek to have it all, and are described as saying, "This is the heir: come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours.<a name=44:9></a>" It is not theirs -- it is Christ's: His by an indefeasible right -- by an indisputable title His.<a name=44:10></a>

		This indeed, when once established, is calculated to overthrow the pride of vain man, who puts in <i>his</i> pretensions for a share; who calls the world his own; but it is not, it is Christ's; and every one who takes it as his own individual right is meddling with things which belong not to him, and of which he must give an account to the rightful owner.<a name=44:11></a> The world then is this field, and the field is Christ's.<a name=44:12></a> "While men slept, his enemy came, and sowed tares among the wheat.<a name=44:13></a>" Here we have the character and circumstances under which this change came about; these men -- these field labourers -- were put in trust, and the enemy brought in the evil seed while <i>these</i> men slept.<a name=44:14></a>

		"When the blade sprung up, then appeared the tares.<a name=45:18></a>" This was the successful result of the enemy's work; they sprung up together.<a name=45:19></a> There was not at first any outward distinction; they were all mixed up together.<a name=45:20></a> There was no remedy for that, as regarded the present state of things; instantly to set the world right was not in the mind of God.<a name=45:21></a> Man was found a faithless steward; he had been negligent, and let in the enemy, and the field was found overrun with tares; but God's plans were not frustrated by it.<a name=45:22></a>

		The servants come and say, "Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field?<a name=46:1></a> from whence then hath it tares?<a name=46:2></a>" He said, "An enemy hath done this.<a name=46:3></a>" The Son of God looked down at His field which He had sowed with good seed, and found it filled with tares: but, though in that position, we find it is <i>not</i> the wisdom of God to set the world to rights by plucking up the tares.<a name=46:4></a> The servants said, "Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?<a name=46:5></a>" This is according to man's wisdom, who would set the world to rights again by plucking up and rooting out heretics, and purging out the wickedness according to their own desire.<a name=46:6></a> "Nay," said the Lord, there are circumstances existing at present which made this proposal impossible to be acceded to; they are now together, and let them both grow together.<a name=46:7></a> If I were to give you power now to pluck up the tares, you might unconsciously root up the wheat with them, which cannot be; "let both grow together until the harvest.<a name=46:8></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord has graciously explained the meaning of the word in verse 39: "The harvest is the end of the world.<a name=46:9></a>" The term "world" here is not the same word as that used previously, where it is said, "the field is the world.<a name=46:10></a>" This unquestionably is (as the literal translation signifies) the age, or dispensation, and should be read, "the harvest is the end of the age.<a name=46:11></a>" In the first instance where it is used, it renders the meaning simply "the world," which is the scene of this great transaction.<a name=46:12></a> It is quite unconnected with the idea of peace, and conveys the time when it was to be thus manifested -- at the end of the age or dispensation, and "at the time of the harvest.<a name=46:13></a>" Says the Lord, "I will say to the reapers [that is, after both are grown up, fit for the operation], Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to <i>burn them</i>; but gather the wheat into my barn.<a name=46:14></a>"

		Now this presents us first with the view of the gathering together of the tares in bundles for the purpose of being burnt, and then the gathering of the wheat into the barn.<a name=46:15></a> After this is the destruction of the tares, as explained by our Lord: "As, therefore, the tares are gathered together and burnt in the fire, so shall it be at the end of this age: the Son of man shall send forth his angels [His messengers, ministers, and ambassadors of His purposes in providence], and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity, and shall cast them into a furnace of fire.<a name=46:16></a>"

		Here is the order: The tares are gathered in bundles to be burned; the wheat is lodged in the barn; the destruction of the tares, or their entire consumption, then takes place; and, finally, after their destruction, "then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.<a name=47:2></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the third parable, spoken to His disciples alone, we find the Lord using terms analogous to these: The angels dividing the two parties which were hitherto mixed up together, gathering the good into vessels, and casting the bad away and destroying them; and then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.<a name=47:3></a> This brings before us the unhindered blessedness of the children of God -- of those who are alive to God.<a name=47:4></a> That time is coming; and it is a thing greatly longed for by the saints.<a name=47:5></a> The present position of the world makes it known to them.<a name=47:6></a> They see that the tares are ripening fast in iniquity, ready for the destruction; and they see the ripening of the saints of God; and, though now apparently and sadly undistinguished, the Lord is ripening them for the harvest and will gather them in.<a name=47:7></a>

		This is a very important position, as displaying the character and work of the Lord Jesus Christ, contrasted with the first Adam, of whom, in his innocence, the latter was a type and figure; the one as the head of all grace and truth, the representative of all believers; and the other as the head of all sin and misery, a representative of all sinners by nature.<a name=52:2></a> This distinction is mentioned in 1 Corinthians 15: "The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven"; and here, verse 14, he is said to be "the figure of him that was to come.<a name=52:3></a>"

		The over-abundant love and grace of the Lord Jesus Christ is testified of in the next verse: "For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.<a name=52:4></a>" And the contrast is very striking as we continue: "And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift; for the judgment was by one to condemnation; but the free gift is of many offences unto justification.<a name=52:5></a> Therefore, as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by one righteousness the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.<a name=52:6></a>"

		In the Psalms we have an exhibition of the mind of the Lord Jesus Christ, under sufferings, trials, temptations, and afflictions; and throughout the Scriptures we have the facts of the life, thoughts, feelings, and character of Adam and Christ.<a name=52:9></a> We have in Adam the head and root of a sinful world, lying in wickedness and misery; and in Christ the head and root of a world of blessedness, reigning in life, opening a

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this is what we are to look for in Christ; a remedy adequate to the evil sin had wrought; a remedy that should meet and overbalance the weight of iniquity: and we have it in Christ, in the exceeding riches of His grace.<a name=53:5></a> The way and means were of His own devising and His own executing, to display His goodness to us in Christ Jesus, that <i>He</i> should be the substance of the joy of His people, the rest of their souls, the object of their hopes, the desire of their affections.<a name=53:6></a> And such He is.<a name=53:7></a> Evil has abounded, and sin has taken its free, full course.<a name=53:8></a> We shall trace its root, rise, and progress in the first Adam, in whose sin we have the complete and entire alienation of man's heart from God: the virtual denial and rejection of God as a God over him, and the practical consequences of that denial -- the taking of Satan as a god in preference, and trusting and confiding in him rather than in God.<a name=53:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, I say, this is just the position the world is in at present.<a name=53:10></a> They have practically and decidedly taken Satan for god, to the rejection of the Lord; they have lost all hopes of favour; they have forfeited all claim to any blessing God can confer.<a name=53:11></a> All the world has done this positively and willingly; and every individual is doing so, until Christ calls him out of the world in principle, desire, and soul; brings him to rest on Him for all things; just undoes in his soul what the sin of the first Adam (and he himself springing from that root) has done; makes him an heir of God; puts into his heart the Spirit, crying, "Abba, Father"; and enables him to know and understand the association of principle, feeling, and actual position in which he stands with Christ, when exclaiming, "My Father and your Father, my God and your God.<a name=53:12></a>" From thence is all our hope and happiness; we are brought over to trust Him, to live in His life, and no longer to live under the dominion of the devil, who "worketh in the children of disobedience.<a name=53:13></a>"

		The sin of Adam induced the wrath of heaven's offended majesty; and we shall see that the work of the Lord Jesus Christ just met, in every circumstance and in every position, this situation; as a man, presenting the very opposite of what Adam was after his transgression.<a name=54:2></a> Let us view Adam first in his creation, as he came out of the hands of God -- the image of God -- in His own likeness; we see him a type of Him in whom dwells the fulness of the Godhead bodily: everything subordinate to him, put in authority under him; all the animals -- everything of animate and inanimate nature in subserviency to him; all brought to him to give them names: "And whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.<a name=54:3></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Psalm 8 evidently refers to this, from verse 4.<a name=54:4></a> But in connection with Hebrews 2, where it is quoted, we find it was typical of the Lord Jesus Christ: "Thou madest him a little lower than the angels" (in His humiliation).<a name=54:5></a> "We see not yet all things put under him" (but <i>that</i> we shall see at His coming).<a name=54:6></a> "But," says the apostle, "we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.<a name=54:7></a>" Here He became practically the head and root of a new creation, manifested so at His resurrection.<a name=54:8></a> The Lord was doing for His people, in His humiliation, all that was necessary to put away sin -- suffered what was due to sin, and suffered unto death.<a name=54:9></a> Being then quickened according to the Spirit of holiness as a risen Saviour, He becomes the Head of a new creation, as Adam was of the old.<a name=54:10></a>

		View Adam in the garden, and we shall discern in his conduct that he had everything that qualified him to be the head and root of a sinful world.<a name=54:11></a> So Christ (as manifesting the very opposite conduct, under the most difficult circumstances) is eminently qualified to be the Head of His people.<a name=54:12></a> Adam was placed in an innocent world, surrounded by every blessing, and with every holy and righteous feeling which could call forth his love and gratitude to the great Giver, and which ought to have led him to confidence in Him.<a name=54:13></a> God had placed trust in him: He put him as a steward over His goods.<a name=54:14></a> He reflected His own image on him, and made

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Being thus trusted of God, put into this highly honourable situation, everything made for him, God delighting in him, as in Proverbs 8: "Rejoicing in the habitable parts of the earth, and my delights were with the sons of men": in this situation of trust, confidence, and delight, what followed?<a name=55:2></a> How did Adam comport himself and sustain his integrity?<a name=55:3></a> The enemy of souls approached.<a name=55:4></a> With subtility he inquires, "Hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?<a name=55:5></a>" and, on hearing God's authoritative threatening in case of delinquency, adds, "Ye shall not surely die: for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.<a name=55:6></a>" At the first outset he impugns the truth of God's word, and endeavours to make Him a liar.<a name=55:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the man was in full recognition of God's command -- "Thou shalt not eat of the tree.<a name=55:8></a>" He knew it was a pledge of his obedience; that God, as supreme Sovereign, should have the satisfaction of being obeyed: he knew the Lord had a right to this obedience, and fully understood that He had threatened punishment in case of disobedience; he knew the Lord had said, "In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt <i>surely die</i>.<a name=55:9></a>" Here we see three things in which the devil desired the man should dishonour God: first, as to His grace: secondly, as to His truth: and, thirdly, as to the majesty of His Godhead.<a name=55:10></a> On this suggestion we find man really acted, and did so dishonour God.<a name=55:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We shall behold, in this transaction, the first Adam denying virtually God's grace, truth, and majesty; and in the second Man we are to see them vindicated and honoured; for "grace and truth came by Jesus Christ," the majesty of Jehovah being also manifested in Him.<a name=55:12></a> Let us now see how Satan and man dealt with God's truth, love, and majesty.<a name=55:13></a> God, as it has been observed, bestowed all favours on this man, made him an example to all the universe of His manifested love, and gave him just one command, that man might have the opportunity of shewing his sense of the favours of God by an easy observance of it.<a name=55:14></a> Satan comes and says to this effect: Did God say so and so?<a name=55:15></a> Do not you believe Him; He did not tell you the truth.<a name=55:16></a> God knows He has kept the only good away from you; do not trust Him.<a name=55:17></a> He does not mean it for your good; He

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in this is included every principle in which God could be dishonoured by man in the position in which Adam then stood.<a name=56:4></a> And how did he act?<a name=56:5></a> When he saw (or she saw, which is the same for our purpose) "that the tree was good for food, and pleasant to the eyes, and to be desired to make one wise," he did eat it, in positive and known disobedience to God's command; he acted on the present enjoyment, without any regard to consequences; and the world has ever since acted precisely on the same principles, and precisely on the same grounds: are they condemned?<a name=56:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Many endeavour to screen themselves by this: I have done no harm to my neighbour; I am not guilty of dishonesty, of thieving, murder, and such like.<a name=56:7></a> No more was Adam; he did no harm to his neighbour (except as his conduct involved all in his guilt); but <i>this</i> was just his condemnation, in not recognising and acting on the truth, love, and majesty of God; in acting on the devil's suggestions rather than God's, and so making God a liar.<a name=56:8></a> God says, "Ye shall die"; the devil says, "Ye shall not": and there is just the question between them.<a name=56:9></a> Which will man believe?<a name=56:10></a> The devil puts the present pleasantness of the thing before the man, and he cares not for the consequences; let those come on the man himself, so that he can lure him to his ruin.<a name=56:11></a> He never tells him "the wages of sin is death"; and man, with the present enjoyments in view, cares not for it either.<a name=56:12></a> "The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life," have present enjoyment connected with them: so he embraces them and runs after them; though in so doing, he denies the truth of God, rejects His authority, and assumes His power.<a name=56:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is really what Adam did; and in the consequences we are all naturally involved.<a name=56:14></a> He believed the devil rather than God; he thought the devil truer than God; he looked upon him as a better friend than God; just as we should rely on the promise and word of one whom we esteem our best friend.<a name=56:15></a> He put the devil's word in place of the law of God; he looked upon God as an austere judge, and grudging; one who had a good thing to give him, and yet denied it to him, because He

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now let us view his conduct after he had sinned.<a name=57:3></a> What do we find him doing?<a name=57:4></a> Hiding himself.<a name=57:5></a> What else could he do?<a name=57:6></a> He would have been well pleased had there been no God to spy out his sin.<a name=57:7></a> But it was not so, and he was now confronted.<a name=57:8></a> The voice of God called aloud, "Adam, where art thou?<a name=57:9></a>" He whom He had entrusted with so many blessings now runs away from Him, and hides himself: he had disputed the authority of God, and sold himself to the devil, and withal involved all his posterity in the guilt of rejecting God as a sovereign, and taking the devil as a god, bowing down in submission to his will.<a name=57:10></a> And in this position is the world at present, in which we are now living, the only living instance of unpunished apostasy: the consequences are to come.<a name=57:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But man is the only intelligent being who is still alive in successful apostasy.<a name=57:12></a> What do we find in the case of the fallen angels?<a name=57:13></a> Their sin brought its immediate and irremediable punishment.<a name=57:14></a> Man -- man alone is abiding in unbelief; condemned indeed, but still the sentence of execution is suspended.<a name=57:15></a> God came down to this man who had thus cast off His allegiance; He came to one who had been His former associate and companion: God brings him out of his hiding-place.<a name=57:16></a> What then is man's first act?<a name=57:17></a> To excuse himself: and here again the world most accurately follows his example.<a name=57:18></a> They sin, and then plead, as an excuse or extenuation of their guilt, temptation, natural desire, expediency, etc.<a name=57:19></a> But we rest on God's truth when we declare there is no excuse that man makes, which is not, in fact, the very ground of his condemnation, yea, the very reason for it.<a name=57:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One instance from Scripture in passing.<a name=57:21></a> In the parable of the marriage supper, the excuse one who was invited gave for not attending was, "I have bought a piece of ground, and must <i>needs</i> go and see it: I pray thee have me <i>excused</i>.<a name=57:22></a>" Where was the "needs be"?<a name=57:23></a> Only just this, that he preferred his own gratification to the reception of the Lord's invitation Just so Adam; his excuse was, "The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the fruit, and I did eat.<a name=57:24></a>" The very excuse he brings is the very ground on which God condemns him: "Because thou hast hearkened unto thy wife .<a name=57:25></a>.<a name=57:26></a>.<a name=57:27></a> cursed is the ground for thy sake.<a name=57:28></a>"

		Now we pass to the Second Man -- the character and work of the Lord Jesus Christ; and we shall see exactly the opposite of this in every particular.<a name=58:2></a> We shall see how in thought, word, and deed, He perfectly vindicated the truth, love, and majesty of the great God of heaven, which man had thus shamefully and wilfully dishonoured.<a name=58:3></a> How did he vindicate the <i>truth</i> of God?<a name=58:4></a> The Lord had said, "Thou shalt surely die.<a name=58:5></a>" Christ came as the great witness to His people, that "the wages of sin is death"; and that by imputation only, for He was perfectly and entirely holy.<a name=58:6></a> But He <i>took</i> our sins; He bore our iniquities.<a name=58:7></a> He was willing to be looked upon as the guilty, and to bear the penalty God had annexed to sin, "Thou shalt surely die," in order to vindicate the truth of God.<a name=58:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		If any on earth could be spared the threatened punishment, it was Jesus.<a name=58:9></a> Holy in all respects abstractedly of His divinity; entirely free from sin or approximation to it; without the slightest shadow of evil as it regarded Himself, and yet by imputation, willing imputation, His: if any could be spared, it was He.<a name=58:10></a> But no; God had said it, and Christ came to bear witness to the truth of God's word.<a name=58:11></a> If we would see the bitterness of sin, the tremendous consequences of it, and its utter hatefulness in the sight of God, where shall we see it but in the death of Christ, God's fellow, His well-beloved Son?<a name=58:12></a> "He spared not his Son"; He delivered Him up to the death of the cross!<a name=58:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We see again how He fully vindicated the love of God.<a name=58:14></a> That God, whom man looked upon as a grudging God, keeping back from him that which was desirable -- <i>that</i> God gave His only begotten Son for man's transgression!<a name=58:15></a> How eminently conspicuous is God's love here, in the sufferings and death of Jesus!<a name=58:16></a> The more righteous and holy Jesus was, the more God's love was displayed in giving Him for sin.<a name=58:17></a> He needed not to die for His own offences, for He had committed none; nor for His own sins, for He "knew no sin.<a name=58:18></a>" He was brought nevertheless to the extremity of suffering and shame, and yet trusted and confided in God, in circumstances all opposite to those in which Adam was placed.<a name=58:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Adam was surrounded with every blessing and comfort: Christ was in the midst of poverty, degradation, and woe; so that He could say, "Reproach hath broken my heart; I am full of heaviness":

	<div class="paragraph">
		Adam was blessed with the full enjoyment of God's countenance up to the moment that he apostatised from God.<a name=59:2></a> Christ, under the very dread of this even in prospect, could look upon all other things as light in comparison; as in Psalm 22, when enumerating some of the indignities He was to receive, He says, "They parted my garments .<a name=59:3></a>.<a name=59:4></a>.<a name=59:5></a> they gaped upon me"; but He adds, "but be not <i>thou</i> far from me, O Lord.<a name=59:6></a>" And still, in the very moment when God was to visit on His soul the most awful effects of His people's delinquency -- when, for their sins and the salvation of their souls, and that they might everlastingly enjoy the presence of God's countenance, He was to withhold the comfortable perception of it from His expiring Son; when, at the extent and summit of such dreadful agony, the exclamation was drawn from His holy soul, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?<a name=59:7></a>" yet is the language of His soul, "But <i>thou continuest</i> holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel": even in the moment of extremest sufferings a <i>doubt</i> of God's faithfulness never passed His holy mind.<a name=59:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Ye shall be as gods" was the bait the tempter threw out, which succeeded in drawing man from his allegiance to God.<a name=59:9></a> Now, how did Christ act as opposed to this?<a name=59:10></a> In Psalm 22 again He says, "I am a <i>worm</i>, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people.<a name=59:11></a>" And we know that, though God Himself, and equal with God, "He made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant; and being found in fashion as a man, he <i>humbled</i> himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.<a name=59:12></a>" Man aspired to be God, and fell; and the Lord Jesus Christ, though very God, humbled Himself to "the dust of death," thus vindicating in His own Person the majesty of the eternal God.<a name=59:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we see that Christ met all the sin and guilt which devolved upon His people, in consequence of Adam's transgression.<a name=59:14></a> He did not endeavour to screen the sin, to hide it from God's sight, to excuse that with which He was laden.<a name=59:15></a> No, He hung between heaven and earth -- "lifted up" -- bearing the iniquity of His people in His own body on the tree.<a name=59:16></a> Far from denying or concealing it, He desires to open all His

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that is just our blessing; that is just what constitutes our peace and comfort, when by faith we can see Him making these sins of ours His own bearing them and their deserved punishment; not only lifting them up to God, but owning them, and bearing them away for ever!<a name=60:7></a> presenting Himself as the victim, to atone for sins which were committed against the truth, majesty, and love of God.<a name=60:8></a> Thus He vindicated God's glory, while He was well qualified to become the head of His people.<a name=60:9></a>

		Colossians 3: 1-4
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The great principle upon which a Christian stands is as to what is his life, and from whence it flows.<a name=62:1></a> The Christian is said to be raised from the dead -- to have risen with Christ; and whatever is not thus quickened and risen is not of Christ.<a name=62:2></a> "He that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.<a name=62:3></a>" All blessing and comfort is associated with this life in resurrection.<a name=62:4></a> There is the entering on a new position, and the setting aside for ever all previous and natural situation.<a name=62:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle alludes to this in the preceding chapter where he says, "And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses.<a name=62:6></a>" And again, in chapter 3: 1: "If ye then be risen with Christ.<a name=62:7></a>" The principle of life flows then from this: that he is dead, dead with Christ, quickened with Christ, risen with Christ; thus manifesting his practical identification with Christ in all things.<a name=62:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Ephesians 2 it is said, "You hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins," to manifest "what is the exceeding greatness of his power to usward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead.<a name=62:9></a>" The same power which wrought in Christ's resurrection is effectual for the spiritual resurrection of His people.<a name=62:10></a> "God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ .<a name=62:11></a>.<a name=62:12></a>.<a name=62:13></a> and hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.<a name=62:14></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Christian then, being quickened with Christ, has the resurrection-life of Christ, and is privileged to sit in Him in heavenly places, unto eternal life, as Christ is now sitting at the right hand of God; and the consequence of this position, when made known to the soul, is to bring in a rich revenue of joy and comfort, even "joy and peace in believing.<a name=62:15></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, where an individual is not in this position, it is just to be under all his trespasses and sins -- to have them upon himself.<a name=62:16></a> He is a sinner, as all are; but <i>he</i> is nothing else than
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=63>[Page 63]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		a sinner in thought, principle, affection, and standing; all <i>that</i> he is, and he is nothing else.<a name=63:1></a> Perhaps he may not outwardly have manifested as much sin as others.<a name=63:2></a> He may have been restrained by regard to decorum; he may not have been placed in such circumstances as to draw it out equally with others.<a name=63:3></a> He may not have had the opportunity as others of appearing as great a sinner, but still he is a sinner, and nothing else.<a name=63:4></a> If he has committed, in thought, word, or act, <i>one sin</i> that is the evidence that he is a sinner, as one bad fruit evidences the unsoundness of the tree.<a name=63:5></a> Where did he get the <i>inclination</i> to transgress?<a name=63:6></a> No union of outward circumstances could have brought forth what was not within.<a name=63:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now there is no association of principle with God as long as man remains in that state; but it decidedly manifests his departure from God.<a name=63:8></a> It was that which caused Adam to be driven out from the presence of God; actual transgression, arising from dissociation of principle from God; and all Adam's responsible posterity have actually transgressed; and so their natural position is, alienation from God: and except those who have received the new life, being dead with Christ and risen with Him -- that is just the position and standing of every individual.<a name=63:9></a> There is no difference of their being driven out -- <i>all</i> were driven out in Adam.<a name=63:10></a> As it says in Romans, "There is no difference, for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.<a name=63:11></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is one grand sin which leads men to the commission of all others -- the desire to please themselves.<a name=63:12></a> If this has once been acted on, it constitutes that man a sinner; just as the breach of one law of the land stamps a man a criminal.<a name=63:13></a> We do not require him to run through the transgression of every law in the statute book in order to bring him in guilty; his having broken one is the evidence of his guilt.<a name=63:14></a> we need no further proof.<a name=63:15></a> While acting then on this as a principle, we are spiritually dead in trespasses and sins.<a name=63:16></a> There is no life, no love, in us; as our Saviour said to those by whom He was surrounded: "I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you" Now this is the real fact, that there is no assimilation to God in man's natural state; but the contrary principle -- hatred, enmity.<a name=63:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this is the position of every individual of the human race, until called out of the general mass by divine grace He is sprung from Adam, associated with him in his sin, as

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If so, we are at present without God in the world; and to be for ever without Him is perfect misery.<a name=64:7></a> And is not this really the present position of the world, though they are unconscious of it?<a name=64:8></a> There is a veil cast on futurity, as it regards them.<a name=64:9></a> They are occupied in the pleasures, amusements, profits, and pursuits of a Christ-rejecting world.<a name=64:10></a> But when the veil is raised, then will their position be disclosed.<a name=64:11></a> And whosoever is of Christ will have Christ's portion; they will enter on the enjoyment of that portion, which by faith they now see is prepared for them.<a name=64:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		By faith alone have we any of these exceeding great promises <i>now</i>.<a name=64:13></a> Now is the time for us to ascertain by faith our personal identification with Christ.<a name=64:14></a> Now are we to know our interest in Him.<a name=64:15></a> The time is coming, yea, swiftly coming, when we shall know even as we are known; and as we are now quickened, raised, brought forth, what should be the effects but to manifest our identification with Christ, in a union so close and abiding that Paul says, "We are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones"?<a name=64:16></a>

		Christ went down into death for our transgressions, though holy, yet accounted guilty.<a name=64:17></a> He did suffer the penalty of sin, and was brought "into the dust of death.<a name=64:18></a>" He became dead.<a name=64:19></a> Having thus put away sin, He rose again -- He is a risen Christ.<a name=64:20></a> A risen Christ is one that was dead; and it is with a risen Christ that we have now to do.<a name=64:21></a> This state of blessedness He reveals to the soul by the Spirit of truth.<a name=64:22></a> He reveals what He

		had done in man's estate for man: as having borne our sins, and thus evidencing that "the wages of sin is death.<a name=65:1></a>" The believer then knows experimentally what Christ was doing here.<a name=65:2></a> He was bearing sin on the cross, and making sacrifice of Himself to the justice of God; "It pleased Jehovah to bruise him.<a name=65:3></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now there is the point on which the Christian rests: the power of the recognition of God's pleasure and God's approbation in the sufferings and sacrifice of Christ; the point at which we feel the woes of Jesus inflicted: not the external perception, irrespective of a personal interest in His unexampled afflictions, such as the daughters of Jerusalem felt, when they bewailed and lamented Him.<a name=65:4></a> "Daughters of Jerusalem," said He, "weep not for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.<a name=65:5></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To weep in tender sympathy for human sufferings and woe does not testify a union of sentiment with God; but the recognition of the <i>wherefore</i> "it pleased Jehovah to bruise him," leading us to sorrow for those sins, and to rejoice at the Lord's approbation of their removal.<a name=65:6></a> This is a godly affection; this brings to the soul a perception of Christ's woes, when He says, "Thou hast brought me into the dust of death.<a name=65:7></a>" When the cup of suffering was presented to Him, mixed up with the bitterness of our sins -- holy, yet agonised -- sinless, yet bruised: does not this present us with the view God must take of sin?<a name=65:8></a> When we see, not the perpetrator, but the bearer of sin only, exposed to such unexampled sufferings; and yet where, in what position, can we perceive so clearly and completely the riches of divine grace, and love, and mercy, as here?<a name=65:9></a> -- " He spared not his own Son.<a name=65:10></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not merely the fact that He was left as it were to the unmitigated rage of man; it was not merely that Adam's sinful race were permitted to "persecute and take him"; but God Himself withdrew the comfortable perception of the light of His countenance, which extorted from Him that bitter cry, "My God!<a name=65:11></a> my God!<a name=65:12></a> why hast thou forsaken me?<a name=65:13></a>" The prophet, in the prospect of this event, declares in Isaiah 53.<a name=65:14></a> "He had done no violence, neither was deceit found in his mouth: <i>yet it pleased</i> Jehovah to bruise him" -- and why?<a name=65:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There must have been some great concern passing between heaven and earth; some wonderful transaction pending between God and man; some immense negotiation which
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=66>[Page 66]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		was now to be decided, sufficient to awaken the world, and into which the very "angels desire to look.<a name=66:1></a>" There must have been a something great and tremendous to have had such consequences attached to it; to have seen Him of whom the Father's testimony was, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased"; and yet "pleased to bruise him!<a name=66:2></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When this great mystery is understood (and none but a believer can enter into the spiritual perception of it), the soul is brought out of a state of death and darkness, and is translated into life and light.<a name=66:3></a> It then sees and feels what it was that caused the Father to bruise Him, and the Son willing to be bound.<a name=66:4></a> When the believer sees Christ reduced to that state of suffering as to cry, "Now is my soul troubled," then the believer himself experiences something of this soul-trouble; when he hears Him exclaim, "The waters are come in, even unto my soul!<a name=66:5></a>" and sees Christ "sore amazed, and very heavy," then he participates in spirit in it; he sees, feels, believes it; and, seeing in it the evidence of the love of Christ, is glad, and rejoices.<a name=66:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And now, what were all these sufferings about?<a name=66:7></a> <i>Sin</i>, sin was the cause of all, and such sin as to draw down such fearful consequences on the bearer of it -- how tremendous!<a name=66:8></a> Now, if we are not such wrath-deserving sinners, for whom was it undertaken?<a name=66:9></a> Assuredly not for us.<a name=66:10></a> If we have not come to the consciousness that our individual sins were so aggravated that in full justice they deserved what was laid on Jesus; that as He was bearing our sin, so was He bearing the penalty of it; if we are not brought to see these sins as ours, and the guilt of them ours, we have no consciousness of assimilation or union with Christ.<a name=66:11></a> If any of you can say, I know nothing of this soul-trouble, this does not describe my feelings and state, then what have you to do with the promises of eternal life to the miserable, wretched, sinful?<a name=66:12></a> If you can say, It is not so with me; I do not think myself so bad as to draw down such heavy judgments upon me individually; I am not worse than others, and sin is not such a grief to me; then assuredly all these sufferings and agony and woe cannot be manifestly about you.<a name=66:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If the consciousness of it has not been to make you "sore amazed and very heavy," troubled and oppressed, then is Christ crucified no concern as yet of yours.<a name=66:14></a> But if we have seen and received the truth, that the death of Christ was the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		wages of our sins; if we have seen and understood the meaning and sense of His sufferings and death, and by appropriation can lay claim to them as ours, then the resurrection comes home to our souls with a quickening and revivifying power.<a name=67:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we have seen Him really bearing the consequences of our sins, brought into the dust of death for us; if we can experimentally understand Christ on the tree, bearing the heavy burden of His people's sins -- so heavy, that they bore Him to the very dust of death and brought Him low, even to the grave; if we can see Him rising without them, having put them away by His precious blood; then are we in a state to enter into the perception of that glorious privilege, "having forgiven you all trespasses.<a name=67:2></a>" Though our sins brought Him down to the grave, yet they could not hold Him there, "because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.<a name=67:3></a>" He rose, having triumphed over sin; He left sin no longer on His people or Himself, but washed it all away, <i>never</i> to appear against them, never again to draw down heaven's wrath.<a name=67:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The grave then has borne witness with us that He was dead; that He put away sin, rose above it and every enemy: the full tide of His people's iniquity was here expiated, and for ever!<a name=67:5></a> Eternal justice poured down the punishment which sin deserved, until sin was no more.<a name=67:6></a> Christ, having risen from the dead, became the living witness that the justice and truth of God were for ever satisfied.<a name=67:7></a> Had there been one sin unatoned for, there the surety must have remained.<a name=67:8></a> "Thou shalt not depart thence till thou hast paid the very last mite": that is what the law exacts, but the penalty was paid in all its demands, and eternal justice perfectly satisfied.<a name=67:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There was no more required, nothing more demanded; and all this in perfect accordance with the purpose, counsel, and determination of God.<a name=67:10></a> The sins were owned, were confessed in penitence and shame, were mourned over, and the bearer held up to heaven, on which were to be inflicted the terrible effects of God's wrath.<a name=67:11></a> That wrath He met, and thus for ever settled the question between God and sin.<a name=67:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is no more suffering for sin; the controversy is now at an end for ever.<a name=67:13></a> Now the believer has done with sin, as regards God's anger and condemnation; he also is risen, risen with Christ -- has recognised it as his sin which is put away by the Redeemer -- that He was accounted the guilty one.<a name=67:14></a> Seeing this, he sees his sin put away; if he did not, it would

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Who then can (or shall) lay anything to the charge of God's elect?<a name=68:3></a> It is God Himself that justifieth; it is Christ Himself that died, yea rather, that is risen; nay in Him His people are complete, and made one by virtue of union with Him here.<a name=68:4></a> How solid is the ground for peace, and an occasion for great rejoicing, "He was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.<a name=68:5></a>" Now we see that this mighty transaction was all about <i>us</i>, and that we are the persons interested in it.<a name=68:6></a> Now indeed we see <i>why</i> Christ became incarnate, suffered, and died: it was for <i>us</i>, and for <i>us</i> too He rose again.<a name=68:7></a> The moment we can, by faith, see our personal interest in the sinless sufferings of Christ, that moment we have the certainty of our redemption; we taste of the cup which He drank, and are associated with Him in all He did and suffered.<a name=68:8></a>

		Having seen what we belonged to as heirs of the first Adam, "by nature children of wrath, even as others," we now see our entrance on another position, as heirs of the second Adam; we see that, as we did belong to that system of whose members it is said, "They have all gone out of the way"; and that "there is none good, no, not one"; and that "they drink in iniquity like water"; believers can say, "Jehovah hath laid on him the iniquity of us all"; they are now translated into another state, another system of things; they are "risen with him through the faith of the operation of God"; they have heard the voice of the Son of God, and live; they live the life of Christ; and though this life is not fully exhibited in this present dispensation, yet it is a real true life.<a name=68:9></a>

		The peculiar joy of the believer is the consciousness that he stands before God as Jesus stands; that he is a partaker of that love which God has for Jesus.<a name=69:19></a> So prayed Christ, "that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.<a name=69:20></a>" Where can we know anything of this love but in Jesus?<a name=69:21></a> The only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He alone declares it.<a name=69:22></a> He brings it to our souls as one

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		John 13:1-11
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Two of these verses claim particular attention in commencing our subject.<a name=72:1></a> The first is, "Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end"; and verse 3: "Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God": for these reasons He arose from supper, and prepared to wash His disciples' feet.<a name=72:2></a> Observe, dear friends, His knowledge that the hour was come when He should depart out of this world unto the Father, and loving His own which were in the world unto the end, was <i>one</i> reason why our Lord washed the feet of His disciples; and knowing that the Father had given all things into His hands, and that He was come from God and went to God, was another reason why He washed their feet.<a name=72:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This demands our attentive consideration: why His leaving the world, and the love which He had to His own which were in the world, and His knowledge of the power over all things which was given Him by the Father, His coming from God and now going to Him, should be the reasons why our Lord (as related in this chapter) laid aside His garments, and took a towel, and girded Himself.<a name=72:4></a> He did this because His hour was come that He should depart out of this world, and because He loved His disciples unto the end.<a name=72:5></a> The reason is explained by what passed between our Lord and Peter: "Then cometh he to Simon Peter; and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?<a name=72:6></a> Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now, but thou shalt know hereafter.<a name=72:7></a> Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet.<a name=72:8></a> Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.<a name=72:9></a> Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.<a name=72:10></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here, dear friends, we see the reason why our Lord's leaving the world, loving His own which were in the world, and an apprehension of His future glory, led Him to wash His disciples feet.<a name=72:11></a> All is explained by His saying, "If I wash thee not thou hast no part with me.<a name=72:12></a>"

		What do we learn from this?<a name=73:1></a> That all His people have a part with Him; they partake of all the benefits of His life and death; they are loved of the Father as Christ Himself is loved by Him; they have a part with Him in His future glory; they are heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ; they shall reign for ever with Christ, sitting with Him on His throne.<a name=73:2></a> In all things they are one with Him, and hence they are assured, "All things are yours, and ye are Christ's, and Christ is God's.<a name=73:3></a>" I say then, dear friends, it was because His own had a part with Him that He washed their feet, when He knew that His hour was come that He should depart out of this world unto the Father; it was "because he loved them unto the end, and was come from God, and went to God.<a name=73:4></a>" Before He left the world, He thus declared why He had come into the world, that His people should have a part with Him, as I have already noticed.<a name=73:5></a> By washing their feet, knowing that the Father had given all things into His hands, He declared that the love which He had for His disciples, while He was with them in the world, would continue after He had left them, and went to God and the glory that He had with Him before the world was.<a name=73:6></a> Washing their feet, with a perfect view of this glory, and a consciousness that He would soon enjoy it, also signified that when in this glory He would continue to wash their feet, according to what He said to Peter: "If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me": and "He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet"; which we shall afterwards consider.<a name=73:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Dear friends, I now direct your attention to the love of Christ for all who have a part with Him.<a name=73:8></a> He shewed this love in coming into the world to save them.<a name=73:9></a> While <i>in</i> this world, how great was the love He manifested for His disciples!<a name=73:10></a> No afflictions, toils, or sufferings that He endured, ever prevented the exercise of this love; neither did their errors, weaknesses, or defects.<a name=73:11></a> <i>One</i> denying, <i>all</i> forsaking Him, did not abate it; it overcame, it continued through all.<a name=73:12></a> His hour was now come that He should depart out of this world: death -- that death which He had undertaken to endure, that they might live for ever with Him in glory -- was before Him, and He viewed it with a full comprehension of its sufferings.<a name=73:13></a> Did <i>this</i> present any obstacle to the exercise of His love?<a name=73:14></a> No: His was a love stronger than death; and therefore we read in Luke 9: 51 "And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up [as we read in another place, 'knowing all things that should come upon him'], he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem.<a name=73:15></a>"

		He knew that He had there to contend with the powers of darkness, followed by His sufferings, death, and the grave; yet, with a full prospect of all, He stedfastly set His face to go to Jerusalem.<a name=74:1></a> Why?<a name=74:2></a> Love urged Him onwards -- love for His disciples, for all who have a part with Him.<a name=74:3></a> It was His Father's appointment; and therefore He said, "The cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?<a name=74:4></a>" It was His own free engagement, expressed in verse 6 of Psalm 40: "Mine ears hast thou opened": better translated, and as you read it in the margin of some Bibles, "Thou hast digged ears for me.<a name=74:5></a>" God the Father digged ears for Christ.<a name=74:6></a> What does this signify?<a name=74:7></a> That the Father appointed and prepared Christ to hear and obey His will in saving His people in the type of His service for ever.<a name=74:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a shade of difference in the case of a Hebrew who preferred serving his master to his liberty, as we read in Exodus 21: a Hebrew servant who had served his master for seven years was then entitled to liberty.<a name=74:9></a> The terms of servitude and its termination are there related: if he came in by himself, without wife or children, he should go out by himself; if he was married, then his wife should go out with him; if his master gave him a wife, and she had borne him sons or daughters, the wife and her children should be his master's; but if the servant, who may have his liberty and go out by himself, should plainly say, "I love my master, I love my wife and my children, I will <i>not</i> go out free," then his master should bore his ear to the door-post, to signify that he was to serve him for ever.<a name=74:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here, dear friends, is an exact representation of Christ's love for the church.<a name=74:11></a> He might have been for ever free from servitude and go out by Himself; He was not bound (I now speak of Him as God) to suffer and die for sinners; but His Father had given Him a wife and children.<a name=74:12></a> You know, that in Scripture the church is described as the wife of Christ, and its members as the children.<a name=74:13></a> In Ephesians 5, speaking of marriage, the apostle declares, "This is a great mystery, but I speak concerning Christ and the church"; and in Hebrews 2, Christ is represented as saying, "Behold, I and the children which God hath given me.<a name=74:14></a>" And, as in the case of the Hebrew

		servant, who so loved his master and his wife and children that he preferred serving his master to his liberty, from love to his master, to his wife, and children; so did Christ plainly declare to His Father, I will not go out free; I love my Father, I love the church, I love the children; mine ear shall be bored; I will bind myself to that the Father has given me to do and to suffer for their salvation, having taken upon me the form of a servant, assumed their nature, descended into their world, and endured all that is needful to raise them to fellowship with the Father and myself in heavenly glory.<a name=75:1></a> This, dear brethren, was the reason that death, and a full apprehension of its sufferings, could not prevent the exercise of Christ's love for His people.<a name=75:2></a> I say, He stedfastly beheld it, yet never turned aside from it: floods of anguish overwhelmed Him; they compelled Him to cry out, as we read in Psalm 49: "Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul.<a name=75:3></a> I sink in the deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.<a name=75:4></a> I am weary of my crying.<a name=75:5></a>" Did this abate the love which was needed to endure it?<a name=75:6></a> Did it here fail?<a name=75:7></a> Did He turn aside from the bitter cup?<a name=75:8></a> No: these many waters could not drown His love; He drank up the dreadful flood, that His people might be delivered from it: He took their place in suffering, that they might take His place in glory!<a name=75:9></a> I say, dear friends, it was in the exercise of this love, and in the prospect of the continuance after He had entered into His glory, that our Head when He knew that He should depart out of this world, girded Himself, and washed His disciples' feet; and this brings us to a particular consideration of what is signified.<a name=75:10></a> As I have already said, It was because they had a part with Him that He washed their feet.<a name=75:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He certainly intended it as a proof and example of humility and condescension.<a name=75:12></a> But observe, while He washed their feet, He said unto Peter, "What I do thou knowest not now, but thou shalt know hereafter.<a name=75:13></a>" This proves that by it our Lord signified another washing, also evident from Peter's saying unto Him, "Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.<a name=75:14></a>" This washing is not the cleansing of their persons, or the pardon of all their sins; as declared by our Lord saying to Peter, "He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit.<a name=75:15></a>" Here the entire cleansing of His people is described; they are compared to

		him who has just left the bath, and is perfectly clean; but we know that his feet might become that moment defiled; and this, dear friends, is precisely our case.<a name=76:1></a> I now speak of believers; Christ appears in the presence of God for us.<a name=76:2></a> This proves that He has for ever removed all our sins; for this He came into our world and lay in the grave.<a name=76:3></a> His resurrection, and now appearing in the presence of God is, I say, a sufficient proof that He has for ever removed from God's sight all our sins; His blood is in their place; they are washed, born of water and of the Spirit, through which they are clean every whit: but, dear friends, our feet are continually defiled; we live in a defiling world, our earthly nature continues, Satan and the world act on it: what is the consequence?<a name=76:4></a> Our mind and conscience are perpetually defiled; not that the guilt of our sins ever returns to the view of <i>God</i>.<a name=76:5></a> This cannot be; Christ is ever before Him for us, and His blood is now in the place where our sins were seen.<a name=76:6></a> But I say our sin and its guilt defile our mind and conscience; it troubles us, it obscures the glory to which we are called, it interrupts our communion with God and the blessedness of fellowship with Christ and the Father.<a name=76:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here is the defilement of our feet, from which we need continual washing; but because we have a part with Christ, though now in His glory, He never ceases to wash our feet.<a name=76:8></a> How does He wash them?<a name=76:9></a> By removing from our mind and conscience everything that interrupts our communion with God, and its glory and blessedness.<a name=76:10></a> We believe that we are admitted to this; but, through the influence of nature and a defiling world, we cannot always enjoy it: everything in our nature, everything in the world, interrupts our fellowship with Christ and the Father, and mars our enjoyment of it.<a name=76:11></a> We still believe, we look up, but if the least guilt remains on the conscience we are dazzled, and perplexed; the glory appears too high for us to reach or enjoy.<a name=76:12></a> Then how does Christ wash our feet?<a name=76:13></a> I say, by delivering us from the consciousness of guilt and its influence: He restores to us a sense of complete pardon; He delivers us from the power of nature and the world; He brings us into unhindered communion with Himself and the Father, and the enjoyment of its glory and blessedness.<a name=76:14></a> He again brings down to our apprehension what we are as seen in Him, and enables us to rejoice in it; and thus does He ever continue to wash our feet.<a name=76:15></a>

		Dear friends, you now see the reason why Christ acted as a servant to His disciples when He was departing out of this world: "He loved them unto the end"; the end, not only of His life on earth, but during His eternal reign in glory.<a name=77:1></a> To them, to <i>all</i> who have a part with Him, He is a servant still; He washes their feet, as I have noticed, and in all His feelings towards them is precisely the same as He was when on earth; no change, no alteration whatever.<a name=77:2></a> Did His love for His disciples triumph over every obstacle to its exercise, over all their errors and defects, their defect in attachment to Himself?<a name=77:3></a> Such is His present love for all who have a part with Him.<a name=77:4></a> Did He bear with all the ignorance, errors, and weaknesses of His disciples, and only notice them to pardon and restore?<a name=77:5></a> Thus does He bear with His people <i>now</i>, equally compassionate and ready to supply all their wants.<a name=77:6></a> Did He say, "I am among you as he that serveth"?<a name=77:7></a> did He actually serve them, pouring water into a basin, and washing their feet, and wiping them with the towel wherewith He was girded?<a name=77:8></a> He is the servant of His people still: He washes their feet with the same condescension and love that He felt for His disciples when He was leaving them to depart out of this world.<a name=77:9></a> Dear friends, let us ever remember that Christ, though now in His glory, is in all things precisely the same as He was when on earth; present with us at all times to render us the same services.<a name=77:10></a> We are one with Him, and He with us; no distinction, no separation, as it respects His sympathy in all that concerns us: "In all their affliction he was afflicted"; "we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.<a name=77:11></a>" Hence, after He had ascended and entered into His glory, when Paul persecuted His people, He said unto him, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou <i>me</i>?<a name=77:12></a>" He will say, "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.<a name=77:13></a>" In serving His people He considers nothing that affects them unworthy of His notice.<a name=77:14></a> He said unto Ananias, "Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul of Tarsus": He knows the street and house where His people dwell, that He might there render them all needful services; for this He numbers the hairs of their heads.<a name=77:15></a>

		Dear friends, here we perceive that Christ will ever be the servant of His people; when they are with Him in His glory He will be unto them all that He was when on earth, so far as they need His services: they will need them only for their enjoyment; and for this, I say, He will always serve His people with the same love and compassion that He felt for His disciples when He washed their feet.<a name=78:9></a> His fellowship with the Father, His power over all things that the Father has put into His hands, He will ever use for making His people perfectly happy.<a name=78:10></a> Now He washes their feet by removing from them everything that hinders their enjoyment of fellowship with Himself and the Father; because our earthly nature and all contact with a defiling world continually interrupt this enjoyment.<a name=78:11></a> But when we are with Him in His heavenly glory, we shall enjoy unhindered communion with God, and its full and perfect blessedness: to secure it Christ will still serve us.<a name=78:12></a> Is it not said, "He shall gird himself and make them sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them"?<a name=78:13></a> Yes, He will do this by revealing and imparting unto them all that is needful for their perfect happiness.<a name=78:14></a> They shall feast with Him; and in this feast He will serve them, they the guests, and He ministering to their enjoyment.<a name=78:15></a> And what a feast will that be!<a name=78:16></a> how great the delight which it will afford, when He who is Lord of all supplies, serves, and entertains every one who is admitted into it!<a name=78:17></a>

		Now, dear friends, you see the reason why Jesus washed His disciples' feet, when He knew that His hour was come that He should depart out of this world unto the Father, and that the Father had given all things into His hands.<a name=79:1></a> He then began the service which, in another manner, He will fulfil for ever.<a name=79:2></a> Now, I say, He washes our feet by removing from us all that defiles our mind and conscience, and hinders our enjoyment of the glory to which He has raised us.<a name=79:3></a> Yes; we have fellowship with Him in His present glory, but a defiled mind and conscience interrupt its comfort and blessedness.<a name=79:4></a> "God," says the apostle in Ephesians 2, "hath quickened us together with Christ, and hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.<a name=79:5></a>" I say we now live with Christ in His glory; but our earthly nature is still in a defiling world.<a name=79:6></a> We resemble the priests who served in the court of the temple, and had free admittance to the holy place.<a name=79:7></a> They were never removed from their service -- why?<a name=79:8></a> Because their persons had been washed and arrayed to prepare them for it.<a name=79:9></a> No need to repeat this, no renewal of their title to their sacred office.<a name=79:10></a> But their hands and feet were continually defiled by the blood of the sacrifices.<a name=79:11></a>

		Then what must they do?<a name=79:12></a> Not depart from their place and office; provision was made for cleansing them.<a name=79:13></a> The laver was placed between the brazen altar and the holy place, in which they washed their hands and feet, and then they served in the tabernacle.<a name=79:14></a> This, dear brethren, is precisely our case.<a name=79:15></a> We are priests, and now dwell with Christ in spirit; for God has raised us together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus, and He has made us kings and priests unto God and His Father.<a name=79:16></a> No alteration in our place and title, no removal from it.<a name=79:17></a> Christ has washed us, and we are clean every whit, and therefore we dwell with Him in heaven itself; we are admitted to unhindered communion with <i>Him</i> who is our sacrifice, our altar of incense, our table of shew-bread, our ark of the covenant -- all that was in the temple; our hands and feet are continually defiled.<a name=79:18></a> What must we do?<a name=79:19></a> Precisely what they did -- feel that our place with Christ and our title as priests are never altered; for these we have been cleansed and arrayed, and, like the priests in the temple, we have only to wash our feet meanwhile.<a name=79:20></a> Christ, I say, dear friends, continues to render us this service.<a name=79:21></a> The world and Satan act on our earthly nature.<a name=79:22></a> We cannot in any

	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus, dear friends, have I endeavoured to shew you why our Lord washed the feet of His disciples, knowing that the Father had given all things in His hands.<a name=80:4></a> Let us consider the obligation which this presents to His people, according to what we read in the chapter before us.<a name=80:5></a> "So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?<a name=80:6></a> Ye call me Master and Lord; and ye say well; for so I am.<a name=80:7></a> If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet.<a name=80:8></a>" How are we to fulfil this?<a name=80:9></a> As Christ does in His heavenly glory.<a name=80:10></a> I noticed the way in which Christ washed His disciples' feet, when He was with them in the world.<a name=80:11></a> He patiently endured all their infirmities, errors, and defects, that He might intercede for them, and remove from their hearts and minds everything that defiled them.<a name=80:12></a> And so in His glory Christ is ever engaged in thus serving His people.<a name=80:13></a> And He truly declared, "Ye also ought to wash one another's feet"; as I said, in the same manner, patiently enduring their ignorance, errors, weaknesses, defects, any defilement that cleaves to them -- patiently enduring it, I say, that we might be the means of removing it.<a name=80:14></a> The servant is not greater than his Lord.<a name=80:15></a> If Christ, now in His glory, is thus engaged, we should think it an honour to resemble Him.<a name=80:16></a> How are we to resemble Christ in washing one another's feet?<a name=80:17></a> By endeavouring to remove from our Christian brethren everything that defiles their mind and consciences, and hinders the blessedness of their fellowship with Christ and the Father; bearing their burdens, comforting them in their afflictions, and restoring them to a right mind by affectionate reproof; also, by praying for them.<a name=80:18></a> Yes, we should resemble Christ, who is their High Priest, ever restoring, ever interceding for them; by endeavouring, I say, to deliver them from their defilement, to remove their sorrows, and to

	<div class="paragraph">
		disengage them from nature and the world by a faithful testimony of their error.<a name=81:1></a> We should also pray for them, pray for their deliverance from everything that defiles and troubles them; like our Lord and Master, ever meek, patient, compassionate, and tender in our conduct towards them.<a name=81:2></a> This is recommended in Philippians 2: "Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.<a name=81:3></a>" The example of Christ is there proposed to us: "Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant .<a name=81:4></a>.<a name=81:5></a>.<a name=81:6></a> and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.<a name=81:7></a>"

		Dear friends, when we consider how little we resemble Christ in His humility, and in all that He did and is now doing as the servant of His people, we cannot wonder that the apostle said, "I have no man like-minded, who will naturally care for your state; for all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's.<a name=81:8></a>" Why are we disinclined to resemble Christ in His services to His disciples?<a name=81:9></a> Because we so faintly apprehend the glory in which He now reigns.<a name=81:10></a> Observe, dear friends, the prospect of His soon enjoying this glory is said to be the reason that Christ girded Himself and washed His disciples feet; He knew that when in this glory He would continue what He meant by the service.<a name=81:11></a> He rejoiced at it; it was part of the joy set before Him; and therefore, I say, He washed the disciples feet.<a name=81:12></a> We see but little of the glory of Christ, and of our glory in having a part with Him; and for this reason we are not inclined to imitate and obey our Lord and Master in washing one another's feet.<a name=81:13></a> As we behold this glory, and enjoy it, so will be our inclination and pleasure to fulfil the lowest service for His disciples.<a name=81:14></a> For in truth, the services that I mean are the highest; because they make us like Him who washed His disciples' feet, who now serves them in all which it signified, and will be their servant for ever.<a name=81:15></a> Observe, then, dear friends, our Lord's declaration: "If I, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another's feet.<a name=81:16></a>" The Lord bless His word, and enable us all to obey Him.<a name=81:17></a>

		There is much to weary us, dear brethren, much to draw out our anxiety as to present circumstances here; and there is much as regards the natural mind which shrinks at meeting God.<a name=83:1></a> The natural conscience of a man, even while he is engaged in the things of this life, often testifies to him that all is not right: he may not always, perhaps not often, feel this silent monitor; business, pleasure, gratification, may dissipate the thought that there is something coming which he is not prepared for.<a name=83:2></a> But though unwelcome, the thought will obtrude, and weary him, and make him uneasy, particularly if he is externally seeking righteousness; he will be very weary to find he has not courage to meet what he knows he cannot avoid.<a name=83:3></a> Nay, even he who disclaims all outward regard to what is right, who is on the broad road of sin and ruin, delighting himself in abounding iniquity, even in his very heyday of enjoyment and sport, an uneasy thought will at some time or another be felt which tells him, This won't do, this is not the end for which I was made; there is something coming.<a name=83:4></a> Perhaps he may not experience this while in the very act of his jovial pleasures; but when alone, a word that has been dropped, either in a discourse or a conversation, or something he has read, or a passing circumstance, will force him to acknowledge, Well, after all, that is the truth, whether I believe it or not; this short life must end in a coming judgment, and I am not prepared for it.<a name=83:5></a>

		This feeling of uneasiness and alarm will obtrude on the mind, whether we view the individual as seeking to justify himself at the approaching day of account, or whether we see him as delighting in the manifested wickedness of his heart.<a name=83:6></a> In the one case, he feels his wants, but is looking for strength where it cannot be found, and, making no progress, is very uneasy; and in the other, the very thought of a God who hates the things he is doing every hour in the day, is a thought fraught with alarm.<a name=83:7></a> Now I suppose there is no person who has heard the gospel preached, who has not, at one time or another, been made thus uneasy, whether he is seeking what he looks upon as a means of justification from himself, or whether he is seeking for what he esteems its own present

		It is this that makes the natural conscience tremble and feel uneasy.<a name=84:6></a> There are many under similar experience, even by the teaching of God's Spirit, and are deeply conscious of their not being at peace with God, and <i>continue</i> thus in suffering till God reveals Himself.<a name=84:7></a> But I am not now speaking of them, but of those whose natural conscience leads them to know that God is not for them.<a name=84:8></a> The Scripture tells us, and the conscience when once enlightened sees, that God met all this in a manner peculiar to Himself -- that He met all that a man's conscience can make out against himself, and met it in such a way as to make a man conscious of possessing peace in the Lord Jesus Christ: and it is really wonderful -- wonderful beyond our utmost limits of comprehension -- when, amidst all our misery, degradation, sinfulness, and weakness, God is found to be for us.<a name=84:9></a>

		In this state of entire alienation from God, neither seeing nor desiring to see His glory and loveliness, there can be no love in the soul, as long as that soul is living without God, and it has manifestly no interest in the things of God.<a name=86:2></a> Being in this position, there is one terrible evil necessarily evident: that if we are living without God, and not following Him, we must be followers of Him who is the enemy of God and of our souls: who is the great deceiver of mankind, and, though he never shews himself, drags his victim down to ruin, and then mocks at his calamity.<a name=86:3></a> This is Satan, that arch-deceiver, who was a liar and a murderer from the beginning; who casts out his bait to decoy man, shewing him that, but carefully hiding the hook, that he may have his unresisting prey in his clutches; and man rushes to take the bait, willingly selling himself to Satan, though he is morally conscious that he is not acting according to the commandments of God.<a name=86:4></a> And this is not said of any one particular class of character or order of men, for all are included in it: "All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.<a name=86:5></a>" There is nothing that can meet the glory of God in all this.<a name=86:6></a>

		There is one great thing as regards unrenewed man: he stands in dread of the holiness of God; he cannot contemplate God's glory with delight, but in that glory he must stand if ever he is saved; he may be changed, and he must be changed, if ever he meet it with joy; but that glory changes not.<a name=86:7></a> The sun is just as bright when earth obstructs our view of it, as when we behold it; clouds may intervene and hide its glory, but when the clouds are taken away, there is the sun just the same, just as bright, as warm, as glorious as ever; and the moment the veil is taken away, we see it as such.<a name=86:8></a> Where is the soul that can stand in the presence of the glory of God, and contemplate that glory in his sullied and natural mind?<a name=86:9></a> "Who may abide the day of his coming?<a name=86:10></a> and who shall stand when he appeareth?<a name=86:11></a>" A child, in order to see the natural light, must previously be brought into life; and so must we, for God cannot change.<a name=86:12></a> Were it possible for God to give up one atom of His glory, or one particle of His holiness, the effect would be that there would be no place where sin would not enter.<a name=86:13></a> Who can tell what would be the consequence if God could suffer the least diminution of His glory?<a name=86:14></a> Where is the

		In this blessed privilege ends all the argument which Paul brings forward in this epistle; he shews them what they are by nature; they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, and so God gave them over to a reprobate mind (that is, a mind incapable of sound judgment in the exercise of what was right or wrong), and the consequence was, they committed all uncleanness with greediness.<a name=88:12></a> But "in due time Christ died for the ungodly.<a name=88:13></a>" Dear brethren, this is the thing that brings comfort and peace and joy to the soul; this is what sets the devil aside; this is what brings a man to cease from loving to sin against God, from rejecting Christ, or refusing the testimony of the Holy Spirit.<a name=88:14></a> This is the effect of having this blessed knowledge brought home to the soul; and what a <a name=89>[Page 89]</a>

		Brethren, beloved of the Lord, seeing that our God has done such great things for us, we know that God is for us, by the love of Jesus, in going before us in all tribulations, so that nothing should separate us from His love.<a name=92:7></a> If you are tempted, dear friends, remember He was tempted before you; if your friends forsake you, remember that Christ is a "friend that sticketh closer than a brother"; the world may leave you, but it is not your friend, but your enemy, "for the friendship of the world is enmity with God"; and you are no longer debtors to the flesh, to live after the flesh, but you live in the Spirit, and therefore should walk in the Spirit, in the same mind that was in Jesus.<a name=92:8></a> Whatever temptation you are under, be persuaded, with Paul, of this one thing, that "neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.<a name=92:9></a>"

		What the devil did was to undo our confidence in God: what Jesus did is to shew us that we may trust Him.<a name=92:10></a> And when the believer sees not this, he is looking to the devil and his temptation more than to the love and power of Christ, who has conquered all his enemies for him; but when our eyes are off all other objects, and on Christ, then, and then only, we can have peace.<a name=92:11></a>

		JESUS, THE RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		John 11: 25
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This chapter presents in the most striking manner the perfect sympathy of the Lord Jesus Christ in all the trials and vicissitudes of His people, even in the sufferings which death brings, and displays the Lord's power and love conspicuous over death.<a name=95:1></a> It shews us what the energy, the utmost energy, of evil can do over those who are even the beloved of the Lord; but it also shews us how the Lord Jesus sets it altogether aside in the energy and in the strength of His own power.<a name=95:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have here the full result of Satan's power, and the perfect triumphing of the Lord over that power.<a name=95:3></a> Death is the result of the power of Satan.<a name=95:4></a> By bringing in sin, he brought in death: "the wages of sin is death"; this is the utmost of Satan's power.<a name=95:5></a> He brought in this at the commencement, he brought it in by deceit; for "he was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth.<a name=95:6></a>" Such has he been ever since; he is called the old serpent and the deceiver; and having deceived, he became the murderer of the first Adam, and, in one sense, of the second Adam.<a name=95:7></a> He was and is a liar: that is his character, as exactly opposed to Christ, who is the truth.<a name=95:8></a> In like manner all the variations of his character are set in opposition to that of Christ: he is the destroyer, and Christ is the giver of life; he is the accuser of the brethren, and Christ the Mediator for them; Christ the truth of God, and Satan the father of lies.<a name=95:9></a> In this character he is first brought before us.<a name=95:10></a> By misrepresenting the truth and character of God, he became the murderer of the souls of men, and brought in death -- this was his power.<a name=95:11></a> Christ came to destroy him who had the power of death, that is, the devil.<a name=95:12></a> The devil murdered souls by falsifying the truth of God.<a name=95:13></a> Here we learn his subtlety -- presenting falsehood and death through the medium of the truth of God in part; and thus, from being a liar, he becomes a murderer.<a name=95:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Men are not aware of the depths of deceit practised by Satan; his plan is not to bring forward at once a broad intelligible falsehood, which carries the lie on the very face of it.<a name=95:15></a> Not so, brethren; he puts it forward under the guise of truth, in the form of truth, and in some sense mixed up with the truth.<a name=95:16></a> It was in this way he deceived Adam; he wanted him to eat

	<div class="paragraph">
		the fruit which God had forbidden him; and how does he proceed?<a name=96:1></a> He says indeed, "Ye shall not surely die!<a name=96:2></a>" Now there was a palpable untruth; but he adds, "Ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil": and this we know in part was the real truth, for immediately we hear God saying, "The man is become as one of us to know good and evil.<a name=96:3></a>" Here we see the lie presented partly in the form of truth: but the truth which was most necessary for man to know, this he kept away entirely, namely, the consequences which would result from the man's taking his advice: this he did not, this he does not, make known to him.<a name=96:4></a> He does not tell him it will end in death.<a name=96:5></a> This is the way Satan presents his destructive baits, not by simply telling falsehood, but so mixing it up with the truth as to destroy the very soul of man, thus from a liar becoming a murderer.<a name=96:6></a> Thus has he brought in the power of evil, the extent of which power is death: "Sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.<a name=96:7></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now all this the energy of the Lord has met in a superior power, which we shall presently see.<a name=96:8></a> Satan attempts to meet the power of the Lord Jesus, and to set up his power in opposition to the Lord's.<a name=96:9></a> We have an exhibition of it in the case of Job, a favoured servant of God, which was, doubtless, permitted for our learning as well as for Job's profit.<a name=96:10></a> We learn from this history how much Satan could bring to play against Job, and the circumscribing of that power by the almighty power of God.<a name=96:11></a> We are told, "There was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them.<a name=96:12></a> And the Lord said unto Satan, Whence comest thou?<a name=96:13></a> And Satan said, From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down in it.<a name=96:14></a>" Observe, brethren, when Satan is described as going "to and fro in the world," "going about seeking whom he may devour" -- under such circumstances we have need of great caution.<a name=96:15></a> But let the saints of God feel it is a permitted power, circumscribed, restrained, and subdued at God's will.<a name=96:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the case of Job we find God saying with authority and permission to Satan, "Behold, all that he hath is in thy power: only upon himself put not forth thy hand.<a name=96:17></a>" Here was the limitation of the permission; Satan could get no more.<a name=96:18></a> He goes to work at once: we read that "Job's oxen were ploughing, and his asses feeding, and the Sabeans came and took them away, and slew his servants.<a name=96:19></a>" Again, "fire came down from heaven, and burned up his sheep, and his servants, and consumed them.<a name=96:20></a> The Chaldeans came upon the camels, and carried them away, and slew the servants.<a name=96:21></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=97>[Page 97]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And lastly "Satan brought a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house in which his children were feasting, and killed them all.<a name=97:1></a>" Here we see the wonderful extent of the power of Satan, but the further extent of the absolute power of God over the power of Satan; for the limitation was, "But on himself put not forth thine hand.<a name=97:2></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Job therefore was invulnerable, his person could not be touched.<a name=97:3></a> But after this we have Satan's power further extended by the almighty power of God, but still with a boundary which he could not pass: He allowed his body to be afflicted by the power of Satan: "but," says the Lord, "save his life.<a name=97:4></a>" Immediately we hear of Job being covered with sore boils from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head, but his life was spared; and when his afflictions had done the work for which the Lord permitted them, they were removed; for we hear, "The Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than the beginning.<a name=97:5></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus blessedly do we see the extent of the power of God over the utmost power of Satan!<a name=97:6></a> Many instances of a similar nature might be adduced.<a name=97:7></a> We have one in the case of legion, the man in whom were many demons.<a name=97:8></a> The power of the living God was acknowledged by these: they were conscious of His superior authority.<a name=97:9></a> We learn how far Satan's power extended in the case of this poor man, to what a dreadful extent it was permitted.<a name=97:10></a> He wore no clothes, he abode in the tombs night and day, cutting himself with stones: no man could bind him, no fetter could keep him; but God kept him.<a name=97:11></a> Therefore he was still in the wilderness in the way of mercy, therefore he was not driven down into the deep; he would then have been out of the reach of grace, but his God had not so ordered it, He would not have it so, and therefore the utmost extent of Satan's power could not accomplish that.<a name=97:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, we see in Zechariah 3 the futility of Satan's power against those whom Jesus is engaged to defend.<a name=97:13></a> Here we view Satan as the accuser of the brethren, endeavouring thus in opposition to meet the priestly character of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=97:14></a> Joshua, a type of Israel, stands before the angel of the Lord, and Satan stands as his accuser, bringing forward his accusations, which might be truth, which might be real, which
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=98>[Page 98]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		were so in some sense; but, having been put aside by almighty grace, the accusations are unacknowledged by the Lord as available to his condemnation: the Lord refutes them all with this appeal: "Is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?<a name=98:1></a>" In this we have the contrast of office between the Lord Jesus and Satan; one the accuser, having the power of death, the other the priestly intercessor, the giver of life; one the liar from the beginning, the other the eternal Truth.<a name=98:2></a> Satan's effort here is to keep the world from the power of Him who is the Prince of life, and he exercises that power over the children of disobedience.<a name=98:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Son of God came to destroy the works of the devil by bringing souls from the power of Satan to the power of the living God.<a name=98:4></a> Observe the way the devil acquired his usurped power over man in the first Adam by presenting evil under the semblance of the truth.<a name=98:5></a> Man trusted to his own wisdom, and so permitted Satan to possess this power over him; man became spiritually dark, and Satan is the ruler of the darkness of this world; and how does he rule?<a name=98:6></a> By the same way he acquired his dominion over man -- not by presenting evil in its own hideous garb; but in a plausible, insinuating manner he presents things to be desired to make one wise; and if man is really led to escape his wily snares, he must consent to become a fool in the world's estimation, and to feel that he is such in his own.<a name=98:7></a> We find the terrible result sin has wrought is death.<a name=98:8></a> Such was the threatened punishment: "In the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.<a name=98:9></a>" Man ate, and so sold himself to him that had the power of death, that is, the devil.<a name=98:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Christ has manifested Himself as the Prince of life; and Satan, in opposition thereto, endeavours to blind the minds of all, "lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.<a name=98:11></a>" And further, when their eyes have been opened, and they have fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope laid before them, he would, if it were possible, hinder all comfortable enjoyment of God's presence, all sensible communion with God through the operation of the Holy Spirit, and would dim and darken the path of every child of God, attempting to meet the priestly office of Christ, as Intercessor, by his accusations, and to oppose the testimony of the Spirit in the soul by his own dark counsels.<a name=98:12></a> But, to oppose all this artillery of power, we have Jesus passed into the heavens, ever living to make intercession for us at the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The interesting history recorded in this chapter demonstrates indisputably the power of the Lord Jesus in setting aside the utmost power of Satan, in the entire overcoming of that by which Satan shewed his triumph over man.<a name=99:2></a> Death was this power; but here we have total subjection of that power to a superior power, to exercise which, in the person of Lazarus, Jesus came to Bethany.<a name=99:3></a> Martha, Lazarus's sister, said to Jesus, "Lord, if thou hadst been here my brother had not died; but I know, that even now, whatsoever thou shalt ask of God, God will give it thee.<a name=99:4></a> Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.<a name=99:5></a>" The commandment had gone forth at the beginning, when it was said to Adam, "Ye shall die"; that power had been felt and acknowledged, and there was no setting it aside; there was no power to put it away, even in the case of those whom the Lord loved, but by a power such as sent forth the commandment at the first.<a name=99:6></a> By that power alone can death be intercepted, even by the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the resurrection and the life.<a name=99:7></a> Jesus says to Martha, "Thy brother shall rise again.<a name=99:8></a>" Martha replies, "I know that he shall rise in the resurrection at the last day.<a name=99:9></a>" Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life; he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live; and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die: believest thou this?<a name=99:10></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two ways in which the Lord Jesus has become the resurrection and the life of His people: first, in purchasing their redemption from the wages of sin, having paid the full price to eternal justice for their transgressions by His voluntary and substituted sufferings; and also in respect of their oneness with Him who is the very life of all being.<a name=99:11></a> We have here the direct personal application of this power to Himself: "I am the resurrection and the life"; but we see in what sense He here alludes to His power of raising His creatures.<a name=99:12></a> There is something special here: a something which meets not the circumstances of every one; it is definitely applied to them that believe; "He that believeth.<a name=99:13></a>" It is, therefore, not applicable to all; and what a recognition of the truth of a special resurrection this is -- of the release from death of all that shall believe in Jesus.<a name=99:14></a> That makes all the difference -- "because I live, ye shall live also,"

	<div class="paragraph">
		alluding to those who believe in Him.<a name=100:1></a> They are the children of the resurrection, which blessing flows from their union with Jesus by the indwelling of the Spirit of life; as it is written, "If the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.<a name=100:2></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here then we have the peculiar, the special, cause of this difference: they are the children of God, therefore the children of the resurrection; they stand in altogether another character from the children of this world.<a name=100:3></a> All shall rise certainly at the coming day of retribution, but it is quite different from the quickening power of life, communicated in virtue of the oneness of the saint with Jesus.<a name=100:4></a> Every knee shall certainly bow to Him; be they godly, or be they earthly, or be they the power of darkness; whether they be angels, or principalities, or powers, all shall acknowledge Him when He appears.<a name=100:5></a> This was just the witness which the devil gave of His power when he came on earth -- "Art thou come to torment us before the time?<a name=100:6></a> "Plainly then there is a time set apart, of which they are conscious, when full judgment will be executed on them.<a name=100:7></a> "They besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep," or abyss.<a name=100:8></a> Though devils, possessing the power of such, they recognised One before whom they quailed.<a name=100:9></a> There is a time coming when He, before whom they even then quailed, will bind them in everlasting chains no more to rove about.<a name=100:10></a> This almighty power they even then recognised in the Person of Jesus Christ, when apparently in weakness; therefore they exclaim, under the conscious terror of His power, Do not torment us before the time!<a name=100:11></a> Do not command us to go into the pit!<a name=100:12></a> He is Lord of all, and His authority extends to, and shall be exerted over, the ungodly, as well as His saints; in the resurrection all are then brought out of the power of Satan.<a name=100:13></a> But the resurrection of which Christ here speaks is peculiar to His own, when He says, "I am the resurrection and the life.<a name=100:14></a>" "I know," said Martha, "that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.<a name=100:15></a>" But what comfort could that bring, as regarded the bare fact of his rising, for so would the most ungodly sinner rise then?<a name=100:16></a> But the blessedness is this, that where Christ is made the life of the soul, there is the certainty of a resurrection to life eternal in Christ's life; when the life of Jesus comes in, there is that

		We find, in the occurrences of this beautiful chapter, that it was during the bodily absence of the Lord from Lazarus that death had its power; so it is with us now.<a name=101:2></a> This family scene is a type of wonderful things to the church: in the absence of her Lord she feels the power of Satan and death -- bodily death seizes on her members; but it shall not always be thus, for Christ shall visit His afflicted family, and when that occurs His very presence will be the power of life.<a name=101:3></a> Here is the great secret: Christ's presence gives spiritual life; and His bodily presence not only raises the dead bodies, but by that presence the further power of death is arrested and interrupted and put aside for ever, as regards His saints; and according as His presence is felt, so is the power of Satan and the power of death set aside.<a name=101:4></a> In His absence is grief, but when He comes, He shall put away both grief and its cause.<a name=101:5></a> Now, He may and does allow temptations, and permit the exhibition of the power of Satan in such; but even now He makes Himself known in spirit as stronger than Satan, quickening the soul, and giving life to His people; sorrow, grief, and distress are here occasioned by Satan, particularly this character of sorrow, brought forward in this narrative before us.<a name=101:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ communicates life and liberty to His people; therefore He says, "I am the life.<a name=101:7></a>" Though there may be still occasion of death in the world, yet when Christ comes and exhibits Himself, His very presence, which before spiritually quickened the soul, will now be powerful to quicken the mortal body, and clothe it with a glorious immortality: "He that believeth on me, though he were dead, yet shall be live" And He will resuscitate the bodies of those that are dead, and arrest the further progress of death: "He that liveth and believeth in me shall never die.<a name=101:8></a>" The consequence of Christ's being present in spirit is now life and liberty: "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty"; so, when present in person, all bondage, grief, or sorrow is vanished.<a name=101:9></a> He shews us now in spirit, what He will shortly do in person, when the whole power of Satan is set aside.<a name=101:10></a> The moment Christ says, I am here, the power of death is gone; when spiritually, it is spiritually gone; for where Jesus has quickened a soul by communicating His life, there His presence has removed us from all the results of Satan's power in the soul; the power of the prince of the air has been superseded by the power of the

		The power of bodily death will not be manifested in all: for we are told 1 Thessalonians that some shall be alive when the Lord comes: "For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up," etc.<a name=102:3></a> Also, in 1 Corinthians 15 it is positively said, "We shall not all sleep," for that some shall be alive at His coming; consequently they never can die, as He says Himself: "He that liveth and believeth in me shall never die.<a name=102:4></a>" The presence of Christ naturally induces the absence of death: he that is dead when Christ comes shall be raised; and he that is alive shall be changed, thus unqualifiedly by His presence setting the power of death aside.<a name=102:5></a> The certainty of this resurrection is consequent upon the vital union of the believer with the Lord Jesus Christ, which, therefore, none can experience but such as are united to Him by a living faith.<a name=102:6></a> It is quite a distinct thing from the resurrection of those who shall be called out by the word of His power; His very presence vivifies the believer in virtue of his being made a partaker of the divine nature.<a name=102:7></a>

		But it is not yet a quickened body: that we feel, most sadly feel.<a name=103:4></a> We are then led to ask, Since it is so, to what use can this mortal body be converted here, since it does not yet partake of incorruptibility?<a name=103:5></a> The only use, dear friends, to which we should convert it is, to make it become a servant to the Saviour.<a name=103:6></a> Let the very instruments of corruption minister to godliness: "Yield your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.<a name=103:7></a>" There is no bondage in this, dear friends; it is perfect freedom; it is the liberty of the child of God, of one who is quickened, made alive, rescued from slavery, made a new man.<a name=103:8></a> Satan wars against the dominion of this new life; but there is no charge that he brings that the Lord at all acknowledges, for the believer stands accepted in the Beloved.<a name=103:9></a> The Lord Jesus Christ exercises His priestly office in opposition to the reasonings and accusations of Satan against the saint.<a name=103:10></a> Satan brings forward the failings of the old man -- the very things which he suggested to the mind, the very sins which by his suggestion the flesh acted out.<a name=103:11></a> These he endeavours to press on the conscience, bringing forward the old man, and saying, That is you!<a name=103:12></a> and if this is not resisted with a "Get thee behind me, Satan," then we allow him to interfere with our comfort.<a name=103:13></a>

		But, blessed truth!<a name=103:14></a> "he that is joined to the Lord is one spirit," "and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.<a name=103:15></a>" The Spirit presents Christ in His priestly office, as having undertaken and accomplished all for the believer; but until the whole body, as well as the soul, is quickened with the life of Jesus, we cannot fully enter into the blessedness of so glorious a liberty: but then we shall manifestly see our entire triumph over the world, the flesh, and the devil, and enter into the full perception of that comforting truth, "Because I live, ye shall also.<a name=103:16></a>" Still, recognising no good in the flesh, we get peace and comfort by simply resting on the promise of

		Jesus, that He will change our vile bodies, and make them like unto His glorious body; and that, in the meantime, "sin shall not have dominion over us.<a name=104:1></a>" The devil would hinder this peace if he could, and seek to do so by entering into controversy with the conscience, and introducing doubts and difficulties, which are encouraged and not repelled, when we are not apprehending Christ in His office of continual Mediator and Intercessor; but we are strengthened, and Satan's power is humbled, when we are looking up in faith, as united to Jesus, and seeing Him, as "the resurrection and the life," directing us in the prospect of that day when His glory shall be revealed, and when we shall be placed in a proper position to perceive our entire conquest in our glorious Head over the utmost power of evil.<a name=104:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But what the devil is always at here is, to draw us to the commission of evil, to do that which dishonours the Holy One within.<a name=104:3></a> And this dims the grace of the Spirit; this is why there are so many sorrowful Christians, because there are so many indulging the lusts of the old man, which shut out the glory; seeking the gratification of that which they profess to fight against, and not walking in the Spirit, in the liberty of Christ; but they are grieving that Spirit, and therefore are burdened; they are not walking in the consciousness of hearing "I am the resurrection and the life.<a name=104:4></a>" But the time is coming, yea, rapidly coming, when the presence of the Saviour shall be always felt, and when, not only by faith but manifestly, the power of evil shall be set aside; when the presence of Jesus shall raise us to unspeakable blessedness; when this corrupt body shall no longer be a clog and hindrance to our spiritual enjoyment, for it shall be entirely conformed to His image, His glorious body.<a name=104:5></a> As He has made the souls of His own here to bear His image spiritually, so will He then change the vile body into the image of that body which He now possesses in glory.<a name=104:6></a> "As we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.<a name=104:7></a>" "It doth not yet appear what we shall be; but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.<a name=104:8></a>" Paul speaks of the same to the Philippians, saying, "Our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall change our vile bodies, that they may be fashioned like unto his glorious body.<a name=104:9></a>" Here is what the saint glories to contemplate,

		It was the want of this sympathy with Christ of which Paul complained: "All seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's.<a name=105:9></a>" We see it here in the instance of Martha: though a saint, though loved of Jesus, she could not enter into the perfect sympathy of the Lord with His own.<a name=105:10></a> "I know," said she, "that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.<a name=105:11></a> Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection and the life.<a name=105:12></a> He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die: believest thou this?<a name=105:13></a>" Not, Do you believe that he shall rise again?<a name=105:14></a> but, Do you believe what I have said of myself as the resurrection and the life of every believer?<a name=105:15></a> But there was no perception of this in her soul: if there had been, it was truly calculated to have conveyed the greatest comfort to her soul: but no, she saw it not; she just replies, "Yea, Lord, I believe thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world," and there she left Him.<a name=105:16></a> She went her way to get sympathy elsewhere, while He, the life of every comfort, and the soul of sympathy, was left.<a name=105:17></a>

		THE PARABLES
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Matthew 13: 1-50
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have read to you the entire collection of parables brought together in this chapter, because they collectively contain one general view of the plan of God, as developing "the kingdom of heaven": that it is not an isolated circumstance, but a connected whole, full of comfort to the saints of God.<a name=107:1></a> It unfolds the distinguishing features of the "kingdom of heaven.<a name=107:2></a>" This term, together with the "kingdom of your Father," is exclusively used by Matthew, and particularly in this chapter, where are developed the character and circumstances of the kingdom in the dispensation of God.<a name=107:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Jesus saith unto his disciples, Have ye understood all these things?<a name=107:4></a> They say, Yea, Lord.<a name=107:5></a> Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is instructed into the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.<a name=107:6></a>" Now, we know that a scribe who was taught from the law of Moses was instructed in the mysteries contained therein, which were to be unfolded in process of time, as the Lord quotes: "I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter things that have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.<a name=107:7></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We find there were seven parables uttered by our Lord here; seven being a complete and perfect number, symbolical of entireness and perfection, wanting nothing, a completeness of intention and performance.<a name=107:8></a> Thus seven Spirits of God are taken for a whole; seven churches, seven trumpets, seven plagues, etc.<a name=107:9></a> Some of those parables were uttered for the disciples only, and the others for the multitude, which we shall perceive by just looking at the structure of the chapter.<a name=107:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first parable we have a symbol of the world as at present; of all who shall or shall not become partakers of the kingdom of heaven.<a name=107:11></a> Here we have the full mind of God upon the subject.<a name=107:12></a> The six others represent a likeness of the kingdom of heaven.<a name=107:13></a> In the first the man sowing the good seed is just a statement of what our Lord was doing in the world, "the field," out of which the kingdom of heaven springs up.<a name=107:14></a> He was there sowing good seed, while the devil was sowing tares -- mingling with them, and mixing with them, but not of them; but of this there is no complete development till the resurrection.<a name=107:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=108>[Page 108]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is the testimony of the Spirit of God: at that time the wheat will be gathered into the garner, and the tares afterwards burned.<a name=108:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in the other parables we find that which resulted from the sowing of the seed absolutely and definitely.<a name=108:2></a> The last three are addressed to the disciples alone, and not to the multitude, as well as the explanation of the first of these six, as it says in verse 36: "Then Jesus sent away the multitude, and went into a house with his disciples"; and, after explaining to them the parable of the tares and the wheat, He says to them, "Again, the kingdom of heaven is likened unto," etc.<a name=108:3></a> The other three, spoken to the multitude were, the tares and wheat; the little seed, or grain of mustard seed, descriptive of the increase and growth of this kingdom; and the leaven hid beneath, but working unseen till the whole is completely leavened.<a name=108:4></a> The three to His disciples alone were, the treasure hid; the pearl of great price; and the net cast into the sea.<a name=108:5></a> Thus He commences with the sowing, and ends with the gathering in.<a name=108:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first three exhibit the development of the character and habit this kingdom should assume in the world ostensibly.<a name=108:7></a> And of the latter three, two are descriptive of its high value in the sight of God, and the consequences of that love: and the last displays the entire distinction and separation between the children of the world and of the kingdom.<a name=108:8></a> The explanation of one parable, given along with this last parable, portrays the manner and mode of this separation -- of those who are children of God, or those who are friends to God's enemy, the devil: "The friendship of the world is enmity with God.<a name=108:9></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will find, on examination, the analogy very strong between the six; between the three to His disciples, and the three to the multitude, to which the explanation of the one is the key; from the first, which is sowing the good seed, to the last, which is drawing the net, of which the others are the medium -- the ostensible character; the organisation of the plan; the building up of it; the actual value of the treasure; the beauty and excellency of the pearl of great price; the management and development of that which is the dispensation of the kingdom of heaven.<a name=108:10></a> These we will not go through now, only just to shew the structure and order of the whole.<a name=108:11></a> Thus the Spirit of God unfolds the way in lively emblems, which are God's most definite testimony to the world, and which are
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=109>[Page 109]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		acknowledged as such by all when taught of God's Spirit.<a name=109:1></a> Here we have the perfect summing up of the dispensation, which is characterised in Scripture as the "kingdom of heaven.<a name=109:2></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is calculated for the joy and comfort of disciples, though spoken to multitudes in parables: they press in the general throng, but they understand not, for they are spoken to in parables.<a name=109:3></a> But, says Jesus, "Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven.<a name=109:4></a>" The world may despise them (it does despise them), it may heap obloquy and contempt on them, for these are not of the world, and the world loves its own.<a name=109:5></a> But the saints have the inestimable, the profound, the incalculable blessing of being children of the kingdom -- children of God; they have a joy and heavenly delight in retirement with Jesus -- of fellowship and communion with Him (of which the world in its natural state knows nothing; of which it is unable to form any conception); conscious of their association with Him, of being in the same position with Him, of being assimilated to Him; this is the constitution of their joy.<a name=109:6></a> They are made friends of God; they are in the same situation as Abraham, when the Lord says, "Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do?<a name=109:7></a>" The Lord condescends to open out His mind -- His plans -- to them.<a name=109:8></a> Abraham was called "the friend of God.<a name=109:9></a>" Exactly in the same way does the Lord now spread out the plan of His dispensations to His own, as He says, "Henceforth I call you not servants, for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth; but I have called you friends, for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.<a name=109:10></a>" Now this is said for the joy and comfort of you who are His disciples.<a name=109:11></a> Treasure it up in your hearts, and, oh!<a name=109:12></a> feel the blessedness, the wondrous blessedness, of being made the depositaries of the Lord's mind: "for who hath known the mind of the Lord?<a name=109:13></a> But we have the mind of Christ.<a name=109:14></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Since this is your position, dear friends, be jealous of squandering your affections, lest you dishonour your trust.<a name=109:15></a> If you sin in the cold, heartless world; if you lightly esteem, or seek not continual enjoyment in, your high privileges, the Lord can put no confidence in you, Christ cannot trust you.<a name=109:16></a> If you are amusing yourselves with the things around you (no matter what), your minds must be opened to the world, and this leads to the love of it; and this is direct usurpation of Christ's
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=110>[Page 110]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		prerogative.<a name=110:1></a> Christ's mind is not opened to the world, but is opened to His own.<a name=110:2></a> He reveals their portion to them, and He sends the Spirit into their hearts, enabling them to cry, "Abba, Father.<a name=110:3></a>" He makes known to them that they have the inheritance of sons, shews them their family interest in it, meets them all, as it were, and unfolds the circumstances of His family, and points out to them their individual interest in it; tells them that they are heirs of this inheritance, and have a part and portion with Himself.<a name=110:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If this is our situation (and it is so if we are believers in the Lord Jesus Christ), should we not be very jealous of admitting anything into our souls that might disturb this harmony, and so disable us from receiving communications with delight -- with the filial fondness of children?<a name=110:5></a> This is what the world knows nothing about, but is the saint's privilege and lot, and neither Satan nor the world can take it from him.<a name=110:6></a> The parable with which this chapter begins introduces this glorious dispensation of which we have been speaking: "A sower went out," etc.<a name=110:7></a> (verse 3-9).<a name=110:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The great principle upon which all the blessing of the kingdom of heaven is founded is the sowing of the seed; there is no external development of the position of man till it is sown.<a name=110:9></a> The Lord Jesus Christ goes forth as the sower.<a name=110:10></a> The seed, in itself, is a perfectly new and distinct thing; it is not in principle assimilated to anything that was there previously; it finds nothing there that it can call its own; it is not a seed of the soil springing up from it, but it is the seed of God -- it comes down from heaven.<a name=110:11></a> It is not a principle in the soil which the Lord acts on and improves: when it comes, it finds nothing akin to it there -- nothing even like it.<a name=110:12></a> It comes from heaven, and leads to heaven; for it is the seed of eternal life.<a name=110:13></a> It is a perfectly new principle -- extraneously so.<a name=110:14></a> When put into the soil, there is then in the soul what was not there before; it is no improvement or modification of that which was previously there.<a name=110:15></a> It is eternal life.<a name=110:16></a> "Of his own will begat he us.<a name=110:17></a>" It is an implanted principle of life which knows no end.<a name=110:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, in all naturally there is no seed of eternal life, as life.<a name=110:19></a> We may have the seed of eternal endurance, but not of life.<a name=110:20></a> But this life is wrought by the implantation of a holy seed, by the power of the word of God, revealing what Christ is to the soul.<a name=110:21></a> It is planted by the word of God, watered by the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=111>[Page 111]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Spirit of God, derives its growth and culture from the same God, and is found bearing fruit to the glory of God until the end, when we come to the "manifestation of the sons of God.<a name=111:1></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, this, which is God's truth, breaks down all the natural hopes of aspiring proud man, who thinks there is that within himself which will lead to this, ignorant that the only principle within him is one of death.<a name=111:2></a> But let him once experience the implantation of this new seed, he will then think very differently.<a name=111:3></a> He will find that he has now a new life; that it is a given life (consequently it could not have been there before); and, moreover, that it is "eternal life," and that that life is in Jesus: "he that hath the Son hath life.<a name=111:4></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is one broad principle with which it is most important to be acquainted, namely, that it is nothing from within ourselves that originates this holy principle.<a name=111:5></a> And we who are taught of God know this to be the case; for the mind, once alive to God, is fully conscious that it does not live by any power in itself, but from the power of the life of Christ, which they were once conscious of not having, but now have been given.<a name=111:6></a> They now see how they stand in the presence of God, not as Adam, for God has stamped death on all that he, or his race, could bring before Him of their own, which is sin; but they know, that though once aliens and wanderers, they have been gathered into the flock, and have been (not made better in their original condition but) translated into another position, even into the kingdom of God's dear Son, who is now in glory.<a name=111:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is no communication then from man to God, which can be the real cause or means of receiving heavenly blessings; for man, by nature, has nothing to bring but sin, which cannot draw down a blessing; for God has stamped this judgment on it -- "The wages of sin is death.<a name=111:8></a>" Now, notwithstanding this truth, what is the expectation of the natural man?<a name=111:9></a> Why, that though God has said this, yet in his case He will not observe it; that God must set aside the honour of His word, the strictness of His holiness, and not give him the wages of sin, which is eternal death; that, in his case, God will dispense with the quickening power which He speaks of as necessary to life, and through and for His Son He will shew him mercy.<a name=111:10></a> But it is not so, it cannot, it will not be so: "he," and he only, "who hath the Son hath life," "they," and they only, "that hear the voice of the Son of God shall live.<a name=111:11></a>" The perceptive power comes to him from heaven, and he then has everlasting

		life; he has what he never had before, but he knows that he has it now.<a name=112:1></a> This is God's truth in the face of a sinful and lifeless world, and testifies the power and agency of the Spirit as manifested in it.<a name=112:2></a> They who hear, hear by His power: "the dead shall hear," therefore the dead must be quickened to hear.<a name=112:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This parable shews us the way in which the seed is scattered.<a name=112:4></a> The Lord is here represented by a sower, and is scattering the seed of His word.<a name=112:5></a> He that receives it receives life into his soul, which was before "dead in trespasses and sins.<a name=112:6></a>" The Lord is scattering the seed now, whether you believe it or not.<a name=112:7></a> He is testifying that you are naturally enemies to God, "alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works," and that the only way of escaping the punishment due is by the reception of this life which He gives, which is in Christ and nowhere else.<a name=112:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The possession of this life is necessary to the entrance into glory.<a name=112:9></a> Now where will you seek it, where will you find it, but in Christ?<a name=112:10></a> God has told you, that "that life is in his Son.<a name=112:11></a>" Have you then this Son of God?<a name=112:12></a> Do you know Him as your life?<a name=112:13></a> Do you hold sweet communion with Him?<a name=112:14></a> Have you a personal fellowship and enjoyment in Him?<a name=112:15></a> Do you understand the blessing of identity with Him, so as to comprehend His own words: "Because I live, ye shall live also"?<a name=112:16></a> If you do, you are blessed, for God is true, and He has said, "He that hath the Son hath life": there is a certitude, an everlasting truth, in it.<a name=112:17></a> The word sown carries the knowledge of Christ to the soul, and that brings us into relation with God; it opens out the blessing of life, and shews us that that life is in Christ, and Christ only.<a name=112:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord scatters the seed, but the enemy does his utmost to hinder its progress; he tries to turn it aside, and to prevent its taking root.<a name=112:19></a> The Lord scatters and divides the seed, but it springs not up alike: there is a marked distinction made in the parable between the manner in which the seed was received in the first and last places where it was sown, which we have in the explanation of the first.<a name=112:20></a> It is said, "When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not"; and of the latter it is said, "He that heareth and understandeth.<a name=112:21></a>" And so we see the work of the devil in the former: "When any man heareth and understandeth not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart.<a name=112:22></a>"

		THE SUFFERINGS OF CHRIST
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Psalm 22: 22
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The whole of this Psalm evidently contains the words and experience of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=120:1></a> It begins with one of His most momentous sentences, as if a direct quotation from prophecy: "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?<a name=120:2></a>" and gives the very words of the infidel Jews, when the Saviour was expiring on the tree, in the eighth verse: "He trusted in the Lord, that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.<a name=120:3></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The whole Psalm is an accurate scene of our Lord's sufferings.<a name=120:4></a> In the verse preceding the text, His agony of soul is described: "Save me from the lion's mouth!<a name=120:5></a>" the intenseness of which agony is thus described in Hebrews 5: 7: "Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications, with strong crying and tears"; and of which we have witnessed the facts in the garden of Gethsemane, where His soul was "sore amazed," and He prayed, if it were possible, to have this cup pass from Him.<a name=120:6></a> And in the concluding part of verse 21 ("Thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns"), we have Him brought to the crisis of extreme suffering, on the very horns of the altar, as describing the sacrifice bound and laid on.<a name=120:7></a> We have His delivery thence, "Thou hast heard me," as in Psalm 40: "I waited patiently for the Lord, and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry: he brought me up also from out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and ordered my goings.<a name=120:8></a>" The very next verse describes Him thus: "I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation [or church] will I praise thee.<a name=120:9></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here we read our Lord's testimony after He had been heard, after He had come out of the horrible pit, after the agony, and suffering, and woe, and death had been past; in short, at His resurrection.<a name=120:10></a> It is just at that time this verse describes Him: and in it we see, first, the office He has taken in declaring God's name to His brethren; and, secondly, we see Him as He stands in the midst of His church, as its Head.<a name=120:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Psalm, throughout, gives us the sufferings of the Lord Jesus, and also His strength, and comfort, and trust in God in the midst of them, which prophecies meet their fulfilment so accurately and fully in His life: "I knew that thou hearest me always"; "I am not alone, for the Father is with me" But there was one hour, one period of darkness, and of agony, when Satan was let loose to buffet Him, but not yet able to turn Him aside -- to take Him off from His high trust in God, when He was brought so low as to say, "The waters have come in even unto my soul": "My soul is troubled, and what shall I say?<a name=121:10></a> Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.<a name=121:11></a>" The very height of His trouble was the hiding of God's countenance.<a name=121:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There were three things which the Lord Jesus had to encounter, and to triumph over, and which were ever before Him -- death, guilt, and the power of Satan.<a name=121:13></a> The union of these against Him was the "power of darkness," which He acknowledges to the multitudes who came to apprehend Him -- "This is your hour, and the power of darkness.<a name=121:14></a>" Now these were the three great enemies which were against us.<a name=121:15></a> We had sinned, and God had declared, "The wages of sin is death.<a name=121:16></a>" We were guilty; and condemnation could not be put away but by the removal of the occasion of it; and Satan was manifestly against us, as an adversary to our final freedom.<a name=121:17></a> Now the Lord Jesus Christ had just to meet all these, and if they were overcome in Him, as the federal Head and representative

		of His people, then there was liberty -- glorious and everlasting liberty.<a name=122:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We find then that Christ had really these three to contend with.<a name=122:2></a> He came to be the sin-bearer; and, bearing sin, He must necessarily subject Himself to its wages, which was death.<a name=122:3></a> Thus bearing sin, guilt was necessarily imputed to Him, and He must suffer its condemnation until God was satisfied.<a name=122:4></a> And finally He must, as the Head of His people, overcome him under whom Adam, and all mankind in him, had failed.<a name=122:5></a> This Christ did; these He met, took, sustained, remained stedfast under, and overcame; conquered them all, obtained the victory -- with wounds and bloodshed indeed; but having triumphed, He rose with the full blessedness of the enjoyment of God's countenance, death having passed, and guilt removed, and Satan overcome by Him, in the name and for the eternal blessedness of His people.<a name=122:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This was fully manifested at His resurrection, which was a seal of His perfect accomplishment and acceptance; when He rose (a living witness to the full satisfaction for sin having been asked and obtained, and God's faithfulness being manifested), "Thou hast heard me," said Christ, "from the horns of the unicorns.<a name=122:7></a>" And then, without any delay, He immediately adds, "I will declare thy name unto my brethren": as if the enjoyment He possessed was incomplete until the knowledge of it was communicated to them whom He had made part of Himself.<a name=122:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ Himself bore witness, and still bears witness by the Spirit, to the souls of believers, that redemption work is completed, and by this they are participators in all His blessedness.<a name=122:9></a> He comes to them with the blessed information of death being triumphed over, guilt being put away for ever, and Satan overcome.<a name=122:10></a> That is the comfort, the joy, the peace He brings to the soul, which the knowledge of these facts leads to.<a name=122:11></a> "I will declare thy name unto my brethren"; as if He had said, I will come and make known to your souls, my brethren, the victory I have obtained over all your enemies, and the consequences resulting from it, as standing perfectly justified.<a name=122:12></a> And in this full position of acquittal all His people stand, when Christ was declared "to be the Son of God, with power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead.<a name=122:13></a>" And having ascended, think you that He has less power now?<a name=122:14></a> No.<a name=122:15></a> Having risen over sin, death, the grave, and

		And thus He brings believers to the adoption of children, to the endearing character of family relationship, not as servants, but sons.<a name=123:2></a> He shews them that He has redeemed them that were under the curse of a violated law, that they might receive the adoption of sons; and then He brings them into the communion of the Father's love -- "Because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.<a name=123:3></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is what He does -- that is what He declares in the hearts of believers by the indwelling of the Spirit; and this union between Himself and His people -- this blessed relationship subsisting between them and the Father, He blessedly proclaimed, immediately after His resurrection, when He declared, "Go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father, and to my God, and your God.<a name=123:4></a>"

		PARABLE OF THE SOWER
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Matthew 13
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have here three reasons why the seed of God's testimony concerning Christ is unproductive, described in the character and circumstances; first, of those who hear by the wayside, the hard rock, and the beaten path in which Satan ever watches to catch away that which is sown in the heart.<a name=129:1></a> In this he is compared to the fowls of the air, which immediately devour the scattered seed that remains on the surface of the earth.<a name=129:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Dear friends, what do we learn from this?<a name=129:3></a> That there is nothing in the natural heart of man to afford root for divine truth.<a name=129:4></a> No, everything within us is entirely dissimilar to God, and therefore to everything that is like Him; and hence we must naturally hate and reject that testimony concerning Himself, which He has given in His word.<a name=129:5></a> The Word signifies Christ, through whom alone God is seen and known by sinful man.<a name=129:6></a> I say, dear friends, there is nothing whatever in the natural heart of man to receive God's revelation of Christ as a Saviour; therefore he ever must and will reject it, till God Himself imparts that vivifying power through which alone Christ is seen and valued.<a name=129:7></a> Everything in our hearts (I now speak of what we are naturally) is unlike God, as much unlike Him as sin is to holiness; and therefore we cannot admit Christ into our hearts any more than the Jews could abide Him in the world.<a name=129:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Dear friends, I say, By nature we are nothing but sin.<a name=129:9></a> Man might consider us amiable, but everything that is not exactly like God He rejects and abhors; and, dear friends, when He looks into our hearts, what does He see there?<a name=129:10></a> Everything, I say, that is the very opposite to Himself.<a name=129:11></a> Can a revelation from Him, can anything of which He approves, be received for a while in this state?<a name=129:12></a> No, everything within us must dislike it, and therefore I say, until God Himself imparts power to receive Christ, our hearts will still remain the hard beaten path trodden by the devil, who will always destroy the seed which is there sown (as described in verse 19 of this chapter), "when any one heareth the word of the kingdom and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart.<a name=129:13></a>" From this, dear friends, we learn that God alone can give the seed of the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		word root within us, which, as the power of God, Satan cannot destroy.<a name=130:1></a> Observe, it is true and real seed that perishes after it was sown, not a false testimony, not something like it, which yet differs from it.<a name=130:2></a> It is truth, God's testimony concerning Christ, that is received in the natural heart and mind; but unless God Himself give it root there, it lies like seed scattered on the surface of the earth, and is immediately caught away by Satan.<a name=130:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A second reason for the destruction of this seed is given us in the description of those who received it as on "stony places, where they had not much earth, and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth: and when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root they withered away.<a name=130:4></a>" Nothing whatever to afford root for it in the natural heart.<a name=130:5></a> Here the seed is not immediately destroyed by Satan, it dureth for a while.<a name=130:6></a> Natural feelings and dispositions give it influence: but observe, dear friends, it is nature still -- that which is unlike God -- what is entirely opposed to Him; and therefore the seed sown in such a heart cannot take root, and must wither away.<a name=130:7></a> Seed on stony ground might have some earth, grow, and produce a flower as beautiful as any that has root.<a name=130:8></a> But let a scorching sun or unfavourable weather affect it, and it will soon wither.<a name=130:9></a> Thus, dear friends, can the natural man receive the word by the exercise of his intellect, and have his natural affections so influenced by it as for a while to resemble those in whom the seed has a divine root.<a name=130:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I say, dear friends, the intellect and affections of the natural man, according to his particular disposition, whether more influenced by his understanding or feelings, may, for a while, be so moved by divine truth as to cause him to resemble those who receive the seed into good ground -- no apparent difference between them.<a name=130:11></a> I speak of what they are in our sight.<a name=130:12></a> They rejoice in Christ; they profess to love Him, and are outwardly separated from the world; they present fruits so like those of God's planting, that I say to human observation there appears no difference between them, but they have no root, and soon wither away.<a name=130:13></a> The seed forthwith sprung up: why?<a name=130:14></a> Because it had no deepness of earth, no solemn views, no serious sense of their past alienation from God and present distance from fellowship with Him.<a name=130:15></a> God can, and in some does, enable His people to rejoice in Christ with exceeding great joy, when they first see and receive Him.<a name=130:16></a> But these instances are few,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=131>[Page 131]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and usually not followed by such good fruit as is seen in those who receive the word with strong affections of heart and mind at a sense of their past transgressions, the dissimilarity of their past lives to everything that was like God, and therefore to everything that He liked, and at their present distance from that fellowship with God, to which they are admitted through Christ.<a name=131:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Those who receive the seed, as in stony places, know nothing of this; they have no apprehension of the glory of Christ; no fellowship with Him through the Spirit; no communion with God: the seed has no root whatever within them, and therefore, though it dureth for a while, it must and will wither away.<a name=131:2></a> Why?<a name=131:3></a> It is declared in verse 21 of this chapter, "When tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by-and-by he is offended.<a name=131:4></a>" All is well with such as receive the word with joy, but have no root, while they live at ease in the world.<a name=131:5></a> They produce fruit as fair and promising as any that is seen in the church; but when they are exposed to worldly loss and persecution for their profession of Christ, when trials and afflictions and the cross meet them in their path, they are offended.<a name=131:6></a> These are the scorching sun which withers the seed and all its fruits.<a name=131:7></a> It has no root which could assimilate the heart and mind to the mind and will of God, and hence they must prefer all that nature loves and God hates, to a knowledge of Him through Christ, and all the glories of His kingdom.<a name=131:8></a> This seed was soon received, had no root, and when tribulation and persecution arose, soon perished.<a name=131:9></a> This, I say, dear friends, ever must and will be the case where the seed is not planted and rooted by divine power -- a power entirely opposed to everything which is naturally within us.<a name=131:10></a> Unless God Himself give us deepness of earth, by leading us into a knowledge of what we are, and what He is, and an apprehension of the glory of Christ, the seed sown in our hearts will wither away; there are things which are too deep for the sun of the world to reach and affect; without them we cannot endure.<a name=131:11></a> In obeying Christ, He may require us to act as though we hated father, and mother, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and our own life also; and unless prepared for the sacrifice, He declares we cannot be His disciples.<a name=131:12></a> How can he be prepared for this, who loves nothing but sin and the present world?<a name=131:13></a> and therefore, dear friends, I again say, that unless God Himself plant and root the word of His truth within us

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We proceed to the third cause, why the seed is unfruitful.<a name=132:2></a> "And some fell among thorns, and the thorns sprung up and choked them.<a name=132:3></a>" What are these thorns?<a name=132:4></a> They are particularly described in Mark 4: 19: "And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.<a name=132:5></a>" Observe, dear friends, the lusts of other things, not only the cares of this world, but the lusts of other things, are equally effectual in destroying it.<a name=132:6></a> What are these other things?<a name=132:7></a> "Other" is here contrasted with everything of which the word testifies: it signifies everything but the word, all that is not the word -- to be plainer, all that is not Christ.<a name=132:8></a> Yes, dear friends, the word, when described as choked, signifies the testimony concerning Christ; but Christ Himself is the word presented to us in this testimony.<a name=132:9></a> To reveal Christ, to bring us into fellowship with Him, to form Him within us, is God's purpose when He plants in us the seed of divine truth; and therefore, dear friends, I again say, the lusts of other things signify anything and everything but Christ.<a name=132:10></a> No matter what it is, if the natural heart loves it, desires it, finds pleasure in it, it is a lust that chokes the seed.<a name=132:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"All that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eye, and the pride of life, are not of the Father.<a name=132:12></a>" To human sight it may assume a very pleasing appearance, what is called amiable, or it may assume the form of lawful duties; but if these proceed from nature, if nature feels ease and satisfaction in them, they are not Christ, they are opposed to Him, and as certainly choke the seed and prevent any fruit from it, as the cares of this world, the deceitfulness of riches, or the most evil dispositions which we condemn.<a name=132:13></a> Everything that is not the fruit of the Spirit is flesh.<a name=132:14></a> The Spirit reveals Christ, and forms Him in the heart, and therefore everything but Christ is among the lusts of the flesh.<a name=132:15></a> All but Christ are the lusts described in Galatians 5, in which it is said, "the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh, and these are contrary the one to the other.<a name=132:16></a>" Christ and nature are entirely contrary to each other, for nature is the flesh and its lusts, and it is declared in Romans 8, "If ye live after the flesh ye shall die, but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.<a name=132:17></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=133>[Page 133]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I again say, that what the natural man calls his lawful duties are among his lusts which choke the seed of the word; they proceed from nature, they serve and please it, a nature which is unlike God and Christ, and therefore what they must hate.<a name=133:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Christian has lawful duties to perform, duties to parents and children, and other relations, and the Spirit of God will teach him to discover and fulfil them.<a name=133:2></a> These duties may then be called Christ, for they proceed from Christ living in him, are done in obedience to Him, and are the effects of His wisdom and power.<a name=133:3></a> I again say, everything but Christ is the thorns that choke the seed and render it unfruitful.<a name=133:4></a> It may assume the appearance of what is called amiable, or it might appear unamiable, it is seen in both forms, but I again say; everything within us and done by us which is not Christ, are the lusts of other things described in Mark 4; and are the thorns which choke the seed and prevent its fruitfulness, as much as any outward wickedness that is generally condemned.<a name=133:5></a> Here, dear friends, are the three reasons why the seed of the word is unfruitful: Satan's power; the natural enmity of our heart to God, to all that He loves and is like Him; and the influence of things seen and temporal -- usually and justly described as the temptations of the world, the flesh, and the devil.<a name=133:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We shall now notice the seed falling into good ground, in which it brings forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirtyfold.<a name=133:7></a> If all that is in the natural heart hates and rejects the word, why is it thus fruitful?<a name=133:8></a> Our Lord Himself informs us, as declared in the beginning of John 15, "I am the true vine and my Father is the husbandman.<a name=133:9></a>" Here, dear friends, is the reason why the seed has a root in any heart and produces fruit.<a name=133:10></a> Such is God's value and love for all the branches of the true vine, that He Himself condescends to be their husbandman, first, to impart to them that power by which the seed has root and grows, and when it becomes a branch in Christ to purge it that it may bring forth more fruit.<a name=133:11></a> This power, as proceeding from Himself, is like God, and loves everything that He approves; hence it is the very opposite of all that is in the natural heart -- it brings into fellowship with Christ.<a name=133:12></a> Christ lives in and through those who experience this power, for, as we read in 1 Corinthians 6, "He that is joined to the Lord is one spirit"; and according to their

		That the vivifying power of the Father is engaged, when the seed takes root in the heart, is declared in two passages of Scripture, to which I shall direct your attention: James 1: 18, "Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first-fruits of his creatures"; and also in 1 Peter 1: 23: "Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.<a name=134:2></a>" Here, you perceive that it is the creating vivifying power of God that provides a root in the heart of man through which the seed abides there.<a name=134:3></a> "Begotten," "born again"; a new birth by almighty power is needful, and effected in every heart where the seed has root.<a name=134:4></a> The resurrection life that is in Christ is imparted to all for whom He died.<a name=134:5></a> With Him they live again, arise, ascend, and sit in heavenly places; they are rooted and built up in Him; He dwelleth in their hearts; because He lives, they shall live also.<a name=134:6></a> The seed must remain in them, but He Himself declared, "Every plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted shall be rooted up.<a name=134:7></a>"

		TWO WARNINGS AND AN EXAMPLE -- BEING THE SUBSTANCE OF A LECTURE ON MATTHEW 26
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have here an example in the case of Jesus, and two warnings in Peter and in Judas.<a name=145:1></a> In Peter we may learn the weakness, and in Judas the dreadful wickedness, of the flesh.<a name=145:2></a> We get in Jesus what we should aim after.<a name=145:3></a> In Judas we see the mere professor, in Peter the saint sifted.<a name=145:4></a> All three are before us in a time of searching trial, and the result of trial is seen in each.<a name=145:5></a> We ought to remember that we have received the Holy Ghost, which Peter had not when he denied the Lord; yet, having the Holy Ghost, we may still learn a lesson from Peter's flesh.<a name=145:6></a> And is not the entire worthlessness of the flesh among the last things we learn?<a name=145:7></a> In Peter we see what the flesh is.<a name=145:8></a> There is no real living upon the hope of the glory, except in measure as the flesh is mortified and brought under subjection.<a name=145:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would dwell, first, upon Judas's apostasy.<a name=145:10></a> He had all the appearance to men of being as the other disciples; he had companied with the Lord, he had been one of those sent forth to preach the gospel and work miracles; but his conscience never was before God.<a name=145:11></a> He might have truth in his understanding (and, indeed, the understanding does not generally receive truth so readily where the conscience is affected).<a name=145:12></a> Again, Judas could not have walked three years with Jesus, and seen His grace and love, and not have had his affections moved.<a name=145:13></a> But then his conscience had never been brought into exercise before God.<a name=145:14></a> So it is with many.<a name=145:15></a> If we watch the saint receiving truth, we shall often find him slow of apprehension.<a name=145:16></a> There is something to be judged before God; something which condemns him, and which involves sacrifice.<a name=145:17></a> For instance, we see most clearly that the precious blood cleanses from all sin; but only let us commit sin -- and how slowly do we apprehend that blessed truth so as to get the comfort of it!<a name=145:18></a> In the latter case the conscience is at work.<a name=145:19></a> In like manner the affections of the unconverted may be moved -- a great company of women followed Christ at the crucifixion, bewailing and lamenting Him!<a name=145:20></a> So we read of "anon with joy" receiving, and "by and by" [or anon, for it is the same word], when tribulation arises, turning away.<a name=145:21></a>

		The natural man wants something to satisfy self before God; and, until he has done with himself, he will be looking for a certain measure of righteousness before God.<a name=146:1></a> He may have been, in connection with this want, instructed in the gospel, and thus the understanding may be clear, and the affections moved: but, unless the conscience be bare before God, there is no <i>life</i>.<a name=146:2></a> Here was Judas betraying his Master!<a name=146:3></a> After all, what was this?<a name=146:4></a> Nothing more, at the bottom, than what was in every heart.<a name=146:5></a> Judas loved money -- no uncommon lust.<a name=146:6></a> And the love of money in a saint nowadays is as bad, or worse, as being done more in the light.<a name=146:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There was sin in Judas's nature: which sin shewed itself in the shape of the love of money.<a name=146:8></a> The next thing was, Satan suggesting a way of gratifying this lust, for he loved money more than he loved Jesus.<a name=146:9></a> And now we find the result of outward nearness to the Lord while the conscience is unaffected -- it was to make Judas reason upon circumstances.<a name=146:10></a> He thought, probably, the Lord would deliver Himself, as He had done before; for, when he found it not so, he threw down the money, and said, "I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood.<a name=146:11></a>" He continues in this nearness to Christ, until, thirdly, we read that "after the sop Satan entered into him.<a name=146:12></a>" In the condition of hypocrisy he gets his heart hardened; and then Satan gets between his conscience and all hope of pardon.<a name=146:13></a> Many a natural man would not betray a friend with a kiss, as Judas soon after did.<a name=146:14></a> His nearness served to harden him; and he actually took the sop from the hand of the Lord!<a name=146:15></a> Even natural feeling was silenced.<a name=146:16></a> So it is when the unconverted man gets into a similar position.<a name=146:17></a> He becomes more vile than ever.<a name=146:18></a> His heart is hardened.<a name=146:19></a> Hypocrisy, and at length despair, ensues.<a name=146:20></a> Such is the flesh and its end.<a name=146:21></a> And the flesh cannot be bettered by ordinances, even where Christ Himself is.<a name=146:22></a> Such is the flesh -- I can hardly say, when left to itself, for man is never left to himself, he is never really independent.<a name=146:23></a> He has the will to be so; therefore he is perfectly a sinner, but if disobedient, he is servant to his lust, "disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures," and slave to Satan.<a name=146:24></a> A natural man has a conscience and shame.<a name=146:25></a> He will not do in the light what he would do in the dark.<a name=146:26></a> But the outward form of Christianity, where it has not touched the heart, only makes this difference, that his conscience is seared, and he is only more subtly the slave of Satan.<a name=146:27></a>

		I turn now to the contrast afforded by what is seen in Peter with what we see in our blessed Lord.<a name=147:1></a> In Jesus we see the obedient, the dependent One, expressing His entire dependence by His praying.<a name=147:2></a> And there was seen an angel from heaven strengthening Him.<a name=147:3></a> He felt the weakness which He had given Himself up to bear; He was "crucified in weakness.<a name=147:4></a>" "All my bones," He says, "are out of joint, my heart is melted like wax in the midst of my bowels.<a name=147:5></a>" "My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death; tarry ye here and watch with me.<a name=147:6></a>" So in the earlier temptation, we hear Him answering the devil out of the word of God.<a name=147:7></a> Jesus might have sent Satan away by divine power, but this would have been no example to us.<a name=147:8></a> So, in this chapter, we see the Lord praying!<a name=147:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If you compare what Peter is doing with what the Lord is doing, you learn the secret of Peter's weakness and the Lord's strength.<a name=147:10></a> What was the effect of trial upon the weakness of Peter's flesh?<a name=147:11></a> He had said, "I will go with thee to prison and to death"; but the Lord has to say to him, "could ye not watch with me one hour?<a name=147:12></a>" They were sleeping for sorrow.<a name=147:13></a> Here was neither prison nor death!<a name=147:14></a> "Watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation" (not merely that there be no transgression).<a name=147:15></a> Peter entered into temptation; Jesus never did at all.<a name=147:16></a> Yet the trial was far greater to Jesus.<a name=147:17></a> Jew and Gentile were against Him, and behind them the power of Satan.<a name=147:18></a> "This," said He, "is your hour, and the power of darkness"; and again, "my soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death.<a name=147:19></a>" Where does He take all this?<a name=147:20></a> The Lord does not sleep and seek to forget His sorrow.<a name=147:21></a> He goes and prays to the Father.<a name=147:22></a> His eye rested not on the circumstances to think of them.<a name=147:23></a> He looked to His Father.<a name=147:24></a> Not that He did not feel; for He said, "Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me.<a name=147:25></a>" It was weakness here as man, and that is real strength.<a name=147:26></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Remember, if we are in entire dependence, the temptation does not meet <i>us</i> at all.<a name=147:27></a> Jesus does not say, 'shall I not go through all these trials?<a name=147:28></a>' but "the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?<a name=147:29></a>" He does not see Pilate or Judas in it; it was not Satan that had given Him the cup, but His Father.<a name=147:30></a> So with us; if in a frame of entire dependence, temptation does not touch us at all!<a name=147:31></a> Trial comes; but, like Jesus, we can say of it, "the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?<a name=147:32></a>"

		Every trial becomes a blessed occasion for perfecting obedience, if near God; if otherwise, a temptation!<a name=148:1></a> Jesus was walking with God.<a name=148:2></a> It was not that He did not feel weakness.<a name=148:3></a> "Tarry ye here, and watch with me," shews the weakness of human condition fully felt.<a name=148:4></a> As in Psalm 22: 14, referring to the cross, He says, "I am poured out like water, all my bones are out of joint: my heart is melted like wax in the midst of my bowels.<a name=148:5></a>" And yet He shrank not from suffering alone when love to His disciples called for it.<a name=148:6></a> "If ye seek me, let these go their way.<a name=148:7></a>" But being in an agony, He prays the more earnestly; it drives Him to His Father; and that before the trial comes.<a name=148:8></a> Then what is the next thing?<a name=148:9></a> When the trial actually comes, it is already gone through with God!<a name=148:10></a> He presents Himself before them saying, "whom seek ye?<a name=148:11></a>" as calmly as if going to work a miracle.<a name=148:12></a> Whether before Caiaphas or Pontius Pilate, He makes a good confession; owns Himself Son of God before the Jews, and King before Pilate.<a name=148:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How comes this difference?<a name=148:14></a> In the first place with Peter the flesh is sleeping; he goes to sleep to get rid of the pressure of circumstances.<a name=148:15></a> Peter has not gone through the trial with the Father.<a name=148:16></a> At the moment when Jesus is going to be led away, the energy of the flesh wakes up, and Peter draws the sword.<a name=148:17></a> The flesh has just energy enough to carry us into the danger where it cannot stand -- that energy deserts us then.<a name=148:18></a> How little real communion is here!<a name=148:19></a> When Christ was praying, Peter was sleeping; when Christ was submitting as a lamb led to the slaughter, Peter was fighting; when Christ was confessing in suffering, Peter was denying Him with cursing and swearing.<a name=148:20></a> This is just the flesh: sleeping when it ought to be waking; in energy when it ought to be still; and then denying the Lord when the time of trial comes.<a name=148:21></a> With Christ it was agony with the Father, but perfect peace when the trial came.<a name=148:22></a> Oh, if we knew how to go on in all circumstances in communion with the Father, there would be no temptation that would not be an occasion of glorifying Him!<a name=148:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The great thing was, Peter had not learned what the flesh is: he did not keep in memory the weakness of the flesh; and thus the condition of dependence was hindered.<a name=148:24></a> He seems to be sincere in wishing to own the Lord Jesus and not deny Him.<a name=148:25></a> There was more energy of natural and very true affection in Peter than in those who forsook the Lord and fled.<a name=148:26></a> He

		We may notice that there are three ways of learning the powerlessness and wretchedness of the flesh: prior to peace, often in desperate struggles (for knowledge and conscience are distinct things); when we have peace, before the Lord in prayer and communion, not daring to take a step till He leads us, and then He is glorified in us in grace and obedience, whatever the trial; or in the bitter experience in which Peter learned it, when flesh is not judged in communion with God.<a name=150:1></a> This last will be the way, so long as we are judging of things instead of judging ourselves.<a name=150:2></a> When we are faithfully judging ourselves and walking with God, we shall enter into no temptation.<a name=150:3></a> Trial may come, but there will be full preparation to meet it; not that we may be able to say, Now I am prepared for this or that temptation.<a name=150:4></a> We are in no certainty from one moment to another as to what trial may be coming; but we shall have the strength of God with us in it.<a name=150:5></a> Therefore our only safe place is watching and prayer -- yes, prayer before the assault -- prayer that may amount to agony; for so Jesus prayed!<a name=150:6></a>

		After weariness of heart in the world -- after the Lord Jesus had gone through the world and found no place where a really broken heart could rest (He could find proud morality enough, but no place where a poor, wearied, broken heart could find sympathy and rest, to open it and give it life) -- He came to shew that what could not be found for man anywhere else could be found in God.<a name=162:14></a> This is so blessed!<a name=162:15></a> that, after all, the poor wearied heart, wearied with itself, with its own ways, wearied with the world and everything, can find rest in the blessedness of the bosom of the Father; and what it could not do in any other place -- tell itself out -- now that it has found God, it can; and that in truth of heart too, as we read in Psalm 32: "Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.<a name=162:16></a> Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile.<a name=162:17></a>"

		We have three parables presented to us in the chapter.<a name=163:10></a> The source of that which is taught in them all is love.<a name=163:11></a> The first parable is that of the shepherd who sought the sheep that was lost.<a name=163:12></a> The second that of the woman who sought the piece of money that was lost.<a name=163:13></a> The third, the father's reception of the returning prodigal.<a name=163:14></a>

		In the last it is not a question of seeking, but of the manner of the father's receiving the son when he had come back.<a name=163:15></a> And this is of much importance.<a name=163:16></a> Our souls need to understand it aright, as well as to know the great cardinal truth that God seeks the lost.<a name=163:17></a> There is many a heart that longs to go back, but does not know how he will be received.<a name=163:18></a> The Lord Jesus tells us the grace and love of God are shewn out, first in seeking, and then in the reception.<a name=163:19></a> In the first two parables we have the seeking; in the third, the reception by the father.<a name=163:20></a> One great principle runs through them all; it is the joy of God to seek and to receive the sinner.<a name=163:21></a> He is acting upon His own character.<a name=163:22></a> No doubt it is joy to the sinner to be received, but it is the joy of God to receive him: "it is meet that <i>we</i> should make merry and be glad" -- not merely meet that the child should be glad to be in the house: the father is the happy one.<a name=163:23></a> The return of the prodigal is joy in heaven, whatever men, whatever Pharisees, may think about it.<a name=163:24></a>

		Beloved friends, this is a blessed truth!<a name=164:1></a> It is the tone that God has raised, and that every heart in heaven responds to.<a name=164:2></a> It is something wonderfully lovely to be let into heaven in this way; and that, too by One who knew heaven so well.<a name=164:3></a> The chord which God strikes Himself heaven responds to and re-echoes, and so must every heart down here that is tuned by grace.<a name=164:4></a> What discord then must self-righteousness produce!<a name=164:5></a> Jesus tells forth the joy and grace of God in thus acting, the joy of heaven, and puts all this in contrast with the feelings of the elder brother -- those of any self-righteous person -- though the description be of the Jews.<a name=164:6></a>

		It is this note sounded from heaven in love, that we read in the heart and ways of Christ down here: "The Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.<a name=164:7></a>" And oh, how sweet!<a name=164:8></a> In one sense it is more sweet to have it here than up there.<a name=164:9></a> It is down here that this love of God (and it must be here, if man is to be reached) is astonishing; it is natural in heaven.<a name=164:10></a> It is here, on earth, amongst us, that God has manifested what He is -- that He has delight in saving lost sinners; "which things the angels desire to look into.<a name=164:11></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thing the Lord Jesus does is to justify God in being good to sinners.<a name=164:12></a> He appeals at once to the natural heart of man.<a name=164:13></a> "What man of you, having an hundred sheep?<a name=164:14></a>" etc.<a name=164:15></a> The shepherd puts the sheep upon his shoulder, and brings it home rejoicing -- have I not a right to seek lost sinners?<a name=164:16></a> Is it not a right thing for God to come among publicans and sinners?<a name=164:17></a> This may not suit a moral man, but it suits God; it is His privilege to come amidst sin -- to come near to ruined sinners -- because He can deliver out of it.<a name=164:18></a> The shepherd lays the sheep upon his shoulders and rejoices; he goes out to seek it, charges himself with it; he takes the whole toil of it.<a name=164:19></a> It was his own interest to do it, because he valued the sheep; it was his, and he brings it home again rejoicing.<a name=164:20></a> Thus He presents the shepherd here.<a name=164:21></a> And thus it is with "the Great Shepherd of the sheep.<a name=164:22></a>" He presents it as His interest to "seek and to save that which is lost": He even makes it His interest in the sense of love; the sheep is His own, and He brings it home rejoicing, bidding others to rejoice with Him.<a name=164:23></a> There is the strength and power of salvation.<a name=164:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But how does the Lord set about it?<a name=164:25></a> We tell people sometimes to seek Christ.<a name=164:26></a> Well, in one sense that is right; for it is quite true that "he that seeketh findeth"; but He never

		said, "Come unto me," until He had first come to them -- come "to seek and to save that which was lost.<a name=165:1></a>" He did not say it from heaven, for the sinner could not go there; but because the poor sinner could not go to heaven to seek Christ, Christ came to the earth to seek him.<a name=165:2></a> He does not say to the poor leper, Come up to heaven; but comes Himself down to the leper in all his need, and says, "Be thou clean.<a name=165:3></a>" Had any other laid his hand upon the leper it would have made him as unclean as himself; Christ alone could touch the power of evil in the leper and have no contamination, but dispel it.<a name=165:4></a> He says, "Come unto me, all ye that labour .<a name=165:5></a>.<a name=165:6></a>.<a name=165:7></a> and I will give you rest.<a name=165:8></a>" It is not to be found here, any more than it was for Noah's dove amidst the deluge.<a name=165:9></a> I have tried the world all through, and it is a sea of evil without a shore; Come to Me, and you will find rest.<a name=165:10></a> Who but Jesus could have said this?<a name=165:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another thing in the second parable -- the painstaking of this love, its eager diligence with determination to succeed in seeking that which has been lost.<a name=165:12></a> It is not a sheep, but money in a house.<a name=165:13></a> Everything is done to get the money.<a name=165:14></a> The woman lights the candle, sweeps the house, she could not stop in the task of love -- diligent active love, until the piece was found.<a name=165:15></a> It was her affair and interest again, because the money was hers.<a name=165:16></a> And then we have the joy when her possession is recovered; her own joy and the tone given to those who are called in to have communion with it: "Rejoice with me, for I have found the piece which I had lost.<a name=165:17></a>" And that is the way of the Lord.<a name=165:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we have the same great principle in this parable as in the former.<a name=165:19></a> There is the patient activity of love in the use of means by the Holy Spirit until the result is produced.<a name=165:20></a> In both parables we see the absolute actings of grace, without any reference to the effect in the heart of the sinner; also, in both this great principle (common, as noticed before, to the three), God's own joy in love.<a name=165:21></a> It was the joy of the woman, as of the shepherd.<a name=165:22></a> Thus the result of man's pharisaic objection to grace was but the bringing out of the declaration by Jesus of the energetic power and activity of this grace, as well as the good will.<a name=165:23></a> There was entire inactivity in the sheep and in the money.<a name=165:24></a> The piece of money, as the sheep, could do nothing.<a name=165:25></a> The shepherd and the woman alike did all; it was their joy, who had lost, to get them back again, because they valued them.<a name=165:26></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is true, at the same time, that there is a most important work -- an effect produced in the heart of the one who has gone astray and is brought back again.<a name=166:2></a> On this account we have the third parable, which shews the feelings of the wanderer; and further, the manner of his reception.<a name=166:3></a> The father's heart and the prodigal's are both laid open.<a name=166:4></a> Not only are the inward workings of the prodigal told out, but we have also the manifestation of the father's heart.<a name=166:5></a> In a word, it is not the estimate formed by the one brought back about the love of the father, that gives the answer to all his thoughts, but the manifestation of his own heart by the father.<a name=166:6></a> There is this one simple fact -- the father is on his neck kissing him!<a name=166:7></a> and that tells him what that heart is.<a name=166:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this last parable the Lord takes up a case, meeting the objection of the Pharisees to His receiving publicans and sinners.<a name=166:9></a> He says, as it were, I will take the case of a man brought to the utmost degradation -- eating husks with the swine (we must remember what swine were to the Jew), there too of his own choice.<a name=166:10></a> Why was the picture drawn thus?<a name=166:11></a> To shew that nothing could put the sinner beyond the reach of grace.<a name=166:12></a> Trace it as far as you please; God will act as God at the end of the story.<a name=166:13></a> Let us look a little at the case in detail (verse 11-13).<a name=166:14></a> This is just our history as men.<a name=166:15></a> The son here was happier far, as a man, when going from home than when returning; he was doing his own will.<a name=166:16></a> And this is the secret of all sin.<a name=166:17></a> But remark, whether we are living in vice or not, we have all turned our back on God.<a name=166:18></a> The young man was as great a sinner when he stepped rich across his father's threshold, as when feeding with the swine in the far country; he had chosen to act independently of God, and that is sin.<a name=166:19></a> He reaped the fruits afterwards of this, no doubt, but that is not the question.<a name=166:20></a> Nay, in one sense, the very consequences of his sin were mercies, because they shewed him what his sin was.<a name=166:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But man makes a distinction between sinners.<a name=166:22></a> So the Lord puts a case where the sinner is gone, even in man's judgment, to the fullest degree of evil, and shews it does not outreach the grace of God -- a case which wonderfully exhibits the truth, that "if sin abounds, grace does much more abound.<a name=166:23></a>" When he first left the house he shewed where his heart was -- alienated, revolted, gone; his back was turned upon his father

		"And there," having reached the far country, he went on gaily in his own will as long as he could; "he wasted his substance in riotous living.<a name=167:7></a>" Any person who lives beyond his means looks rich for a time; so does the sinner, wasting his soul, seem happy.<a name=167:8></a> But if he thinks himself happy, he does so because he has got to a distance from God, where he has no restraint upon his will.<a name=167:9></a> But then, after all, he is in the devil's country, and enslaved to him.<a name=167:10></a> Liberty of will is just slavery to the devil.<a name=167:11></a>

		Such too was the thought of Simon the leper, respecting the poor woman who washed the feet of Jesus with her tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.<a name=182:9></a> Ah, if this man had been a prophet (if he had known the mind of God), he would have sent away this woman out of his presence, "for she is a sinner.<a name=182:10></a>" And why?<a name=182:11></a> Because he did not know that the Lord was gracious.<a name=182:12></a> He had a certain sense of the righteousness of God, but not the knowledge of His grace.<a name=182:13></a> I cannot say that God ought to be gracious; but I can say (if ignorant of His grace), that He ought to cast me, as a sinner, away from His presence, because He is righteous.<a name=182:14></a> Thus we see that we must learn what God is to us, not by our own thoughts, but by what He has revealed Himself to be, and that is "the God of all grace.<a name=182:15></a>"

		If grace then be what God is toward me, and has nothing at all to do with what I am, the moment I begin to think about myself as though God would judge me because of my sins, it is evident that I am not then consciously standing in grace.<a name=189:4></a> The heart naturally has these thoughts; and indeed it is also one of the effects of being awakened, for the conscience then begins directly to reason about what God thinks of it; but this is not grace.<a name=189:5></a> The soul that turns back upon itself to learn God's judgment about it, and what His dealings with it are likely to be, is not leaning upon what God is -- is not standing in grace.<a name=189:6></a>

		I have said that there are two things which, though quite distinct, are nevertheless frequently confounded in the minds of the saints -- a bad conscience, and the groaning of the spiritual man because of evil around.<a name=189:7></a> The moment we get a little away from the sense of grace, we shall be in danger of confusing these together.<a name=189:8></a> Suppose for instance that I, as a saint, am sensible of the terrible weight of evil which is all around me, and groan about it, soon (unless it be guarded against) this will mix itself up with trouble of conscience; I shall lose the sense of God's love and put myself under law.<a name=189:9></a> But a saint may "groan" thus without at all losing the consciousness of love, nay, for the very reason that he has it.<a name=189:10></a>

		When the Lord Jesus "groaned in himself" and wept at the grave of Lazarus, His deep sense of the sorrow which sin had brought into the world did not affect that of His Father's love.<a name=189:11></a> We find Him using at the same time the language of the fullest confidence in that love -- "Father, I know that thou hearest me always.<a name=189:12></a>" And so a Christian may be sorrowful, but should not on that account feel as though God were not love, or lose the sense of His grace.<a name=189:13></a> Love to others combined with a spiritual perception of evil will cause us very much sorrow.<a name=189:14></a> Jesus felt this infinitely more than we can ever do, because the power of love in His heart made Him so much more deeply sensible of the dreadful weight of evil which was

		We have "suffering," "groaning," etc.<a name=190:3></a>, spoken of in Romans 8.<a name=190:4></a> Paul groaned within himself from the consciousness of infirmity, from distress, trials, etc.<a name=190:5></a>; but this raised no question in his mind about the certainty of God's grace -- quite the contrary.<a name=190:6></a> The more conscious we are that the Spirit dwells in us, the more we shall "groan.<a name=190:7></a>" The more certain we are of blessing, the more we realise grace; the more we know of God's love, and the effects of that love, the more shall we "groan" at all that is at present around us; but not as though these things brought the smallest cloud over divine favour.<a name=190:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul is spoken of as groaning in spirit, and why?<a name=190:9></a> He realised the result of the grace in which he stood.<a name=190:10></a> Through the power of faith being made conscious of the blessings which are his, he groans within himself after them; but never as if there were the slightest doubt respecting his salvation.<a name=190:11></a> Delivered he is from all uncertainty as to the fulness, the freeness, of divine favour towards him; and in the consciousness of this he groans within himself, "waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.<a name=190:12></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		The end of chapter 7 describes quite another sort of groaning, though, as before remarked, the two are often confounded together; because, as sin is still dwelling in us (in our flesh), those who are not really established in grace do not discern the difference between them.<a name=190:13></a> The whole chapter is full of what people call experience; not of that which is (properly speaking) Christian experience, but of the thoughts of the mind within and about itself.<a name=190:14></a> The state described is that of a person, quickened indeed, but whose whole set of reasonings centres in himself.<a name=190:15></a> I could not venture to say how many times he says "I," and "me": the whole chapter is full of it.<a name=190:16></a>

		All this may be very profitable experience to bring us to the conviction of our utter hopelessness in ourselves.<a name=191:12></a> Still let us put it in its right place, and remember that it is not, properly speaking, Christian experience; but that it only describes the feelings of a soul that has not yet fully and experimentally known the simple fact, that "when we were without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly"; or else that of one who, through the workings of the flesh, has slipped back to looking at himself, and at what he is, instead of looking at God -- at grace.<a name=191:13></a>

		Faith produces many effects in our hearts always suitable to the object at which it looks.<a name=191:14></a> If for instance faith looks at the law, it sees its spirituality far more clearly than nature can; and then, seeing the flesh too in its real vileness, if it looks no farther, but judges of itself according to this spirituality of the law, the effect must be to bring us under condemnation of it (I mean of course as to our feeling) -- under the consciousness of guilt and weakness.<a name=191:15></a> We shall hate, and seek to separate from evil; but that will be all; it will leave us crying out, "O wretched man that I am!<a name=191:16></a>" With increased light there will only be increased misery.<a name=191:17></a>

		What then is the position in chapter 7?<a name=192:12></a> First of all the apostle establishes the great principle that the believer is "dead to the law.<a name=192:13></a>" Then he describes the workings of a quickened soul, which, knowing that the "law is spiritual," still feels "under the law," and is therefore compelled to exclaim, "O wretched man that I am!<a name=192:14></a> who shall deliver me from the body of this death?<a name=192:15></a>"

		It is quite clear that, while there is this experience felt, there is not simple faith in God's grace; there is not a clear view of what God is towards me in Christ; for when the soul apprehends that, when the faculties of the new man are exercised on their proper object, there is perfect rest.<a name=193:3></a> And though there is still conflict, yet the soul is at peace: "the battle is not ours, but the Lord's.<a name=193:4></a>"

		But does the certainty of grace take us out of all trouble?<a name=193:12></a> No; I am not at all denying the fact that there is, and while we are in a sinful body that there ever must be, conflict going on between the flesh and the Spirit.<a name=193:13></a> But then to have this conflict going on in the conscious certainty that God is for me, because I am "under grace," is a very different thing from having it in the fear that He is against me, because I am "under law.<a name=193:14></a>"

		The apostle speaks (chapter 8) of the "carnal mind" being "enmity against God"; but then God in the gift of Jesus has brought out this blessed truth, that when man was at enmity against God, God was love towards man: our enmity was met by His love.<a name=194:1></a> The triumph of grace was seen in this, that when man's enmity had cast out Jesus from the earth, God's love brought in salvation by that very act -- came in to atone for the sin of those who had rejected Him.<a name=194:2></a> In the view of the fullest development of man's sin faith sees the fullest manifestation of God's grace.<a name=194:3></a> Where does faith see the greatest depth of man's sin and hatred of God?<a name=194:4></a> In the cross; and at the same glance it sees the greatest extent of God's triumphant love and mercy to man.<a name=194:5></a> The spear of the centurion which pierced the side of Jesus only brought out that which spoke of love and mercy.<a name=194:6></a>

		The apostle then goes on to shew that those once at enmity with God are now become His heirs; and that the knowledge of this is founded on the knowledge of grace: "Ye have not received the spirit of bondage again," etc.<a name=194:7></a> Grace first makes us children of God, and then gives us the knowledge of it, and that we are heirs of God.<a name=194:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have got away from grace if I have the slightest doubt or hesitation about God's love.<a name=194:14></a> I shall then be saying, I am unhappy, because I am not what I should like to be.<a name=194:15></a> But, dear friends, this is not the question: the real question is, whether God is what we should like Him to be, whether Jesus is all we could wish.<a name=194:16></a> If the consciousness of what we are, of what we find in ourselves, has any other effect than, while it humbles us, to increase our adoration of what God is, we are off the ground of pure grace.<a name=194:17></a> The immediate effect of such consciousness should be to make our hearts reach out to God and to His grace as abounding over it all.<a name=194:18></a>

		But is there any uncertainty as to our salvation in this groaning?<a name=195:4></a> No, quite the contrary; it is the very certainty that "all things are ours" which makes us "groan.<a name=195:5></a>" Having the certainty and foretaste of glory everything here is made the more painful by contrast.<a name=195:6></a> That which the saint is entitled to is so very different from all that is actually around him, that the more he knows of the joy of dwelling in the presence of God, the larger understanding he has of God's love and grace; the more he realises the blessedness of his portion in that glory to which he is predestinated, the more will he "groan"!<a name=195:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		How different this from the groaning of an uneasy conscience!<a name=195:8></a> Let us not mistake, dear friends; let us not confound the two: this groaning of one perfectly free from the sense of condemnation described in chapter 8, and the groaning of conscience, the "O wretched man that I am!<a name=195:9></a>" of chapter 7.<a name=195:10></a> Carelessness of walk, and through it losing the sense of grace, may indeed expose him who has once consciously stood in the power of redemption to the fiery darts of the wicked one.<a name=195:11></a> But this is not, as before remarked, true Christian experience.<a name=195:12></a> When the heart is made full with the rich blessings of Christ, it will not turn back to gnaw upon itself.<a name=195:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And then this groaning is always accompanied by confidence in God.<a name=196:4></a> As with Jesus, when "he groaned in the spirit and was troubled" at the grave of Lazarus, He said, "I know that thou hearest me always"; so is it given to the saint to have the like confidence (see 1 John 5: 14, 15).<a name=196:5></a> Nor should this confidence even fail, when we "know not what to pray for as we ought," for it is added, "but we know that all things work together for good," etc.<a name=196:6></a> I may see evil in myself -- in another saint -- in the church, and seek to pray about it, but yet not have sufficient intelligence to know what would remedy it; the Spirit will help my infirmity, and groan within me.<a name=196:7></a> God does not regard my ignorance, but answers according to "the mind of the Spirit," who always "maketh intercession for the saints according to God.<a name=196:8></a>" I ought to be so confident of God's directing "all things, as to be able to say, I am certain all things work together for good.<a name=196:9></a> Is a soul in this state?<a name=196:10></a> Come what may -- trouble, sorrow, disappointment, grief, whatever it be -- all is peace, for it is resting upon God, and not (as in chapter 7) looking at itself.<a name=196:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Our very griefs then flow from the knowledge of God's immense love, and from the consciousness of all that belongs to us in Christ.<a name=196:12></a> Jesus fully knew, as none other, what the presence of God, what the enjoyment of His favour, was, and "groaned," because, coming from the presence of God, He found man out of it.<a name=196:13></a> The life which I now have identifies me, not with responsibility as "under the law," but with Christ, who has borne the judgment of a broken law for me.<a name=196:14></a> Instead of being wretched and miserable because looking at myself as under law, I enjoy the consciousness of redemption, rest in grace, and "rejoice in hope of the glory of God.<a name=196:15></a>" But the moment we get a glimpse of the glory of Christ as

		This groaning on account of evil always associates itself with love.<a name=197:2></a> If for instance I see a saint sin, it leads me at once to the love and grace he is sinning against.<a name=197:3></a> It is the consciousness of divine favour which I have towards that saint which makes me anxious about him; and while I grieve at his sin, I have joy in God in the midst of my sorrow.<a name=197:4></a>

		Well, beloved friends, if these things be so, if this be the place in which grace sets us, let me ask, Is it so with you?<a name=197:5></a> If God be pure love -- nothing else than love to us; if there be no mixed feelings in Him, then if you have not full joy, if there is any hesitation in your souls as to your standing before Him, you cannot be simply resting in His grace.<a name=197:6></a>

		"THE COUNSEL OF PEACE"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Zechariah 6:13
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This chapter, written after the return of the Jews from Babylon, and when they were seeking to rebuild the temple, was intended to encourage them in that work.<a name=208:1></a> It speaks therefore of Joshua, Heldai, Tobijah, Jedaiah (those who had come from Babylon), by name.<a name=208:2></a> But "no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation"; and although some event previously to take place may occupy the chief part of it, the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ is looked forward to as the ultimate point, the true consummation.<a name=208:3></a> So here after an allusion to the history of God's providence in the four great monarchies, and to the judgment of Babylon, the prophet comforts the hearts of those who were returned thence with a direct prophecy of Christ.<a name=208:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ is the great object of the love of God, and the Spirit of God in Scripture always looks on to Him.<a name=208:5></a> No matter what the substance of the prophecy, no matter what the circumstances of those addressed, He looks forward, seeing all things as they concern Christ, and His future glory The Jews, for instance, had many deliverers raised up for them of God in times of need (Nehemiah 9: 27) -- "saviours who saved them out of the hand of their enemies"; but the moment the Holy Ghost begins to speak of these many "saviours," He ever looks out further: they were all but types of THE "Saviour" When Adam fell, and judgment came in, Christ is promised the woman's Seed, as the bruiser of the head of the serpent.<a name=208:6></a> After the trial of Abraham's faith in Isaac, the promise is made unto his Seed, "which seed is Christ.<a name=208:7></a>" Again, "out of Egypt have I called my son," we are taught, referred to Christ.<a name=208:8></a> And so here: "He shall build the temple of the Lord; even he shall build the temple of the Lord; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne.<a name=208:9></a>" It is "the man whose name is The BRANCH" who shall do all this.<a name=208:10></a> Zerubbabel is merely a type.<a name=208:11></a> Nothing is spoken casually, but all with a view to the ultimate purpose of the glory of God in Christ Whether it affect the destinies of man, of Israel, or of the church; all centre in Jesus; God's thoughts about Jesus are marked on all.<a name=208:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It must have been a great comfort to the saints of old to

	<div class="paragraph">
		have future glories thus opened to them, for whenever the Holy Ghost had awakened spiritual desires in any heart, those desires could not be satisfied with anything then seen of temporal deliverance or blessing.<a name=209:1></a> Much had they to thank the Lord for -- to sing His praise for what He had done; but there was always either the actual presence of evil, or the fear of danger and evil still.<a name=209:2></a> In the days of Josiah, when there was so great a returning to the ways of the Lord, and such a passover kept that the like of it had not been since the days of Samuel the prophet, yet even then was Jeremiah uttering denunciations against the evil of the people, and the Spirit of God, in denouncing their sin, ever referred to the new covenant, holding out the Lord Jesus as the One in whom alone the fulness of blessing was to centre.<a name=209:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so with the church now.<a name=209:4></a> We have indeed greater blessings and clearer revelations, but still there is evil, for we are yet in the body.<a name=209:5></a> In times of the greatest revivals, there has ever been that mixed with them which tended to evil.<a name=209:6></a> We have surely much cause to thank God and rejoice, but nothing really to satisfy.<a name=209:7></a> We must still be looking onward to the future blessings in Christ.<a name=209:8></a> Never, till He appears, will the full desires of our hearts be given us; never, until we "awake in his likeness," shall we really be "satisfied.<a name=209:9></a>" Nothing less will suffice, because the Spirit of Christ is in us.<a name=209:10></a> Constant dissatisfaction and constant thanksgiving meanwhile; for, if we know Jesus risen, nothing short of the full power of His resurrection can content.<a name=209:11></a> Our hopes run on to God's ultimate purpose of complete blessing.<a name=209:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And here we have unity of hope with the Jews.<a name=209:13></a> They, indeed, are looking for earthly glory -- their city and temple being rebuilt, etc.<a name=209:14></a> -- that part of the future blessing in Christ of which Psalm 72 speaks; and we also look forward to see the earth "filled with the knowledge of the glory of Jehovah," whilst Christ's own proper portion in the heavenly glory is our peculiar hope.<a name=209:15></a> Both earthly and heavenly glories meet in Jesus, and will be manifested when He comes.<a name=209:16></a> He is the Head of both.<a name=209:17></a> "The counsel of peace" is between Jehovah and the Messiah.<a name=209:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But where is Jesus now?<a name=209:19></a> As "the man whose name is The BRANCH," the "priest upon his throne" -- an earthly throne -- He does not yet rule; peace is not yet established upon the earth, for Satan is yet exercising his power.<a name=209:20></a> But
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=210>[Page 210]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		there is a throne upon which He does sit.<a name=210:1></a> He has sat down upon the "Father's throne" -- "at the right hand of the Majesty on high," and this "when he had by himself purged our sins.<a name=210:2></a>" There He is as the High Priest of His people.<a name=210:3></a> And thus is given to us a plain revelation of "the counsel of peace.<a name=210:4></a>" Peace is our portion even now.<a name=210:5></a> We are set in the exercise of faith, by which we know and have this peace in our souls, whilst waiting for its establishment on the earth and the time of the manifested glory.<a name=210:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a "counsel of peace" which belongs to us, an assured peace, peace indeed in the midst of present trouble, but still God's peace.<a name=210:7></a> If it were not God's peace, it would be good for nothing.<a name=210:8></a> I may, it is true, have my spirit much disturbed, and know trial of heart; but still I have a title to perfect peace amidst it all -- not only peace with God, but peace concerning every circumstance, because God is "for us" in it all.<a name=210:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Had not man been in rebellion against God, there would have been no need for "the counsel of peace.<a name=210:10></a>" Adam in paradise needed it not.<a name=210:11></a> But man has rebelled, and, though its modifications may be various, rebellion against God is still the characteristic of the unconverted heart.<a name=210:12></a> Such was his rebellion, that peace between man and God seemed impossible.<a name=210:13></a> But now, wondrous grace!<a name=210:14></a> we see that there is not only peace, but a "counsel of peace" -- thoughts of God concerning peace, thoughts which Jesus alone could meet.<a name=210:15></a> "Lo, I come to do thy will, O God!<a name=210:16></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Supposing God had made peace with Adam, the peace could not have lasted: the enmity in the heart of man, or that produced by the power of circumstances thwarting his will, would very soon have broken it again.<a name=210:17></a> Look at Israel.<a name=210:18></a> They were placed in outward peace with God, owned as His people, favoured in every way; and yet what was the result?<a name=210:19></a> Continual murmuring on their part, constant rebellion.<a name=210:20></a> As to moral peace with God, they had scarcely undertaken to keep His law when they set up a golden calf to worship, and thus failed directly.<a name=210:21></a> And it would always be the same; it must be so for the very will of man is altogether wrong; "the carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.<a name=210:22></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But now "the counsel of peace" is between God and Jesus, instead of man, and hence security.<a name=210:23></a> It is not merely

		<a name=211>[Page 211]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		peace, but "the counsel of peace.<a name=211:1></a>" The word "counsel" implies deliberate purpose.<a name=211:2></a> What solidity must there be in that peace which God had a "counsel" about, and all the engagements of which the mind of Jesus fully entered into and accomplished!<a name=211:3></a> I have said that peace is our proper portion as the children of God -- peace both as to sin and as to circumstances.<a name=211:4></a> Now it is true that the latter we have not outwardly yet, but God is taking up all that concerns us, and has taken upon Himself to make "all things work together" for our good; and the knowledge of this gives peace (if we will use our privilege) in all circumstances, be they even those of trial, perplexity, and sorrow.<a name=211:5></a> Was it not so with Jesus?<a name=211:6></a> who can be so tried as He?<a name=211:7></a> "Consider him that endured such contradictions of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds"; yet He had always peace.<a name=211:8></a> And so might we: "Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee, because he trusteth in thee.<a name=211:9></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But then it is most important to see that "the counsel of peace" is entirely between God and Jesus.<a name=211:10></a> The moment we begin to rest our peace on anything in ourselves, we lose it.<a name=211:11></a> And this is why so many saints have not settled peace.<a name=211:12></a> Nothing can be lasting that is not built on God alone.<a name=211:13></a> How can you have settled peace?<a name=211:14></a> Only by having it in God's own way.<a name=211:15></a> By not resting it on anything, even the Spirit's work, within yourselves, but on what Christ has done entirely without you.<a name=211:16></a> Then you will know peace; conscious unworthiness, but yet peace.<a name=211:17></a> In Christ alone God finds that in which He can rest, and so it is with His saints.<a name=211:18></a> The more you see the extent and nature of the evil that is within, as well as that without and around, the more you will find that what Jesus is, and what Jesus did, is the only ground at all on which you can rest.<a name=211:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God could no more rest in anything here, than Noah's dove could find a rest for her feet amidst the wrath and destruction that deluged the world.<a name=211:20></a> But Jesus comes in, and here -- on this earth, where honour to God was wanting -- here He glorified God.<a name=211:21></a> When God's eye rested upon Jesus, He was perfectly satisfied.<a name=211:22></a> Till that moment God had not seen anything in this earth of which He could say, as of itself, in this "I am well pleased.<a name=211:23></a>" He had gone on, it is true, dealing with man in love and grace, but He could find nothing wherein to rest.<a name=211:24></a> "They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable: there is none that doeth good, no, not one," etc.<a name=211:25></a>,

		was what God saw when he "looked down from heaven.<a name=212:1></a>" But when Jesus was searched throughout, nothing was found but perfect love and perfect devotedness to God; even when forsaken of God, He still justifies Him -- "thou art holy.<a name=212:2></a>" Had it ended there, had it been only Christ's own perfectness, all the result would have been to shew out the more clearly our sinfulness and ruin by the contrast.<a name=212:3></a> But according to "the counsel of peace," He gave Himself.<a name=212:4></a> Peace was ever His; it was for us that He "made peace by the blood of the cross"; and thus is He, unto God, a "sweet savour of rest" for us.<a name=212:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Our peace is established in what He did, and "the counsel of peace" is "between them both.<a name=212:6></a>" Jesus has accomplished that which God purposed towards us.<a name=212:7></a> In order to this, it was needful that He should "bear our sins," and this He did as the "sin-offering.<a name=212:8></a>" He was made "sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.<a name=212:9></a>" In the sacrifices, when the offerer laid his hand upon the head of the victim, there was in that act the complete identification of himself with the victim.<a name=212:10></a> Now there are two great characters in the sacrifice of Christ: the one, that of the burnt-offering; the other, that of the sin-offering.<a name=212:11></a> We lay our hands on Him as the "burnt-offering," thus identifying ourselves with Him.<a name=212:12></a> "Accepted in the beloved," all His perfectness, all His "sweet savour" unto God is ours.<a name=212:13></a> But then as to the "sin-offering," it is just the reverse with the hand laid upon the victim; it became identified with my sins, charged with my guilt.<a name=212:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, beloved, the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus had this double character.<a name=212:15></a> He has completely accomplished the purpose of God, all that which was in "the counsel of peace.<a name=212:16></a>" This "counsel of peace" was not between me and God, though I have, as the fruit of it, the enjoyment of the peace.<a name=212:17></a> I had not to do with it in any sense; it was "between them both.<a name=212:18></a>" All is done, and Jesus, both the accomplisher and the accomplishment, in proof that all is finished, has sat down on the throne of God.<a name=212:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		But it may perhaps be added, Why, if the work is perfectly accomplished, is He yet a Priest upon the throne?<a name=212:20></a> He is not there at all as a Priest to work out righteousness for us: that He has done, and done completely: "this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins, for ever sat down on the right hand of God.<a name=212:21></a>" <a name=213>[Page 213]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		His sitting down is the proof that He has nothing more to do in that way for His friends, and now He only waits "till his enemies be made his footstool.<a name=213:1></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But then, in order that we may have the enjoyment of these things, He is acting in another way as Priest.<a name=213:2></a> Having the Spirit of Christ dwelling in us, we consequently see many things in ourselves contrary to Him -- many things that would hinder fellowship with God.<a name=213:3></a> Now here it is that the present ministry of Christ comes in.<a name=213:4></a> We need His priesthood in order to maintain our communion with God; we need Him in our daily sins, as it is said, "if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.<a name=213:5></a>" We need the presence of perfect righteousness on our behalf before God; who has ever before His eyes, and that "for us," the accomplisher of "the counsel of peace," "Jesus Christ the righteous.<a name=213:6></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here then is "the counsel of peace" which was purposed between God and Jesus.<a name=213:7></a> Here, and here only, have we peace.<a name=213:8></a> If ever our souls have any idea of rest except in that which is the perfect rest of God; if ever we are looking for peace anywhere else, be it where it may, we have got out of God's way of accomplishing peace, off the ground of this "counsel of peace.<a name=213:9></a>" He has not called us into "the counsel," which really is entirely independent of ourselves -- "between them both" -- accomplished, sure, and everlasting.<a name=213:10></a> Nothing can ever touch it.<a name=213:11></a> God has publicly owned His acceptance of Christ's work, by seating Him at His own right hand.<a name=213:12></a> The Holy Ghost is sent to witness to us that Jesus is now "on the throne of God," having "by one offering perfected for ever them that are sanctified.<a name=213:13></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		We may have a great deal of trial (we know we shall), trial from circumstances around, trial from within, exercise of conscience, and the like; but still we have the perfect certainty of God's favour; and "if God be for us, who can be against us?<a name=213:14></a>" With Paul we may reckon, because of His having given Jesus for us, along with Jesus upon everything.<a name=213:15></a> This is the true way to reckon upon His kindness -- "Be careful for nothing, but in everything, by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known unto God; and the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds, through Christ Jesus.<a name=213:16></a>" Observe, he says, "the peace of God.<a name=213:17></a>" Again, the word is "be careful for nothing": if one single thing were excepted, God would <a name=214>[Page 214]</a>

		not be God.<a name=214:1></a> Well, if exercised, and troubled in spirit, tempted to be "careful," let us go to God about it.<a name=214:2></a> Our wishes may possibly be foolish wishes: still, let us go and present them to God; if they are so, we shall very soon be ashamed of them.<a name=214:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have need of this "counsel of peace," because all that we are in ourselves is enmity against God.<a name=214:4></a> I cannot go out of this "counsel" to look at my own heart for a moment: it is "between them both.<a name=214:5></a>" Is the Christian to make Christ's cross less complete?<a name=214:6></a> On that alone his peace can rest.<a name=214:7></a> The moment we come to establish its perfectness, the moment we seek to add a single thing, we are adding to, or rather taking away something from, the perfectness of "the counsel of peace.<a name=214:8></a>"

		John 5: 17-47
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are three very important characters in which the Lord Jesus is presented to us in these verses: --
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, as THE SUBJECT OF TESTIMONY;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Second, as THE GIVER OF LIFE;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Third, as THE EXECUTOR OF JUDGMENT.<a name=215:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now He stands in relation to all men in one or other of these positions.<a name=215:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, He presents Himself as the SUBJECT OF TESTIMONY, but it is nevertheless as coming in the Father's name.<a name=215:3></a> "I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.<a name=215:4></a> If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.<a name=215:5></a> There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true," verse 30-32.<a name=215:6></a> His own witness was also true; but that which He states is, that He seeks not to glorify Himself, He demands not their confidence, He asks them not to believe.<a name=215:7></a> Just as He says elsewhere, "He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory; but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.<a name=215:8></a>" And this ever holds good.<a name=215:9></a> If a man is seeking to exalt self, he has a motive that is not truth -- his witness is not true.<a name=215:10></a> At the same time there was a witness unto Himself, and as such He appeals to all the various testimony that existed for Him in the world.<a name=215:11></a> "Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth," verse 33.<a name=215:12></a> Again, "The works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me," verse 36.<a name=215:13></a> Again, "The Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me," verse 37.<a name=215:14></a> And again, "Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me," verse 39.<a name=215:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord Jesus refers to these four witnesses: firstly, John; secondly, his works; thirdly, the Father; fourthly, the Scriptures: and yet He tells those to whom He spoke, "Ye will not come to me, that ye might have life," verse 40.<a name=215:16></a> Presented with this full and adequate testimony to the consciences of men (not merely an abstract testimony, but that which was suited to their circumstances), they refused it all: they would

		Another character in which we find the Lord Jesus presented here is in LIFE-GIVING POWER: "As the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will," verse 21.<a name=216:5></a> Life-giving is attributed both to the Father and the Son.<a name=216:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is marked distinction in that which follows, as to the third character of Christ -- THE EXECUTOR OF JUDGMENT.<a name=216:7></a> "The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son," verse 22.<a name=216:8></a> As "Son of man," He has been dishonoured and rejected by men; therefore all judgment is committed into His hands, in order "that all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father," verse 23.<a name=216:9></a> Here He stands alone.<a name=216:10></a> And see the point that is settled here.<a name=216:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When the Lord Jesus presents Himself as giving life, He also, and most graciously, shews us how we may count on the assurance of possessing life.<a name=216:12></a> Now this is of the very last importance.<a name=216:13></a> There is many a one that can with truth of heart own Him as the giver of divine life, who nevertheless is unable to say, I have that life.<a name=216:14></a> Our Lord does not leave the anxiety of such unanswered.<a name=216:15></a> After stating that all men (even those who had rejected Him, as we have seen) one day in His character of Judge should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father, He adds, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation [judgment]; but is passed from death unto life," verse 24.<a name=216:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The question is one of judgment or of life.<a name=216:17></a> We have seen that the Father gives life, and the Son gives life.<a name=216:18></a> We have seen, too, that all judgment is committed unto the Son.<a name=216:19></a> But here Jesus shews who is to come under the judgment, and who is to have life.<a name=216:20></a> This answers the question at once.<a name=216:21></a> He says, He that believes "<i>hath</i>," not shall have, "everlasting life"; and that such a one "shall not come into judgment, but is passed from death unto life.<a name=216:22></a>" On this basis all happy feeling before God, all joy, is founded.<a name=216:23></a> Here begins the exercise of all holy affections and ways.<a name=216:24></a> A child cannot love its parent before it is born (there is no need to reason about that), though

		Here is the difference between the law and the gospel.<a name=217:2></a> Law puts a man upon the <i>acquisition</i> of life, it sets him to do before he gets life.<a name=217:3></a> All Christian holiness, all Christian affections, flow from the fact of <i>having</i> life.<a name=217:4></a> The voice of the good shepherd reaches the ear, and he who hears it, believing that the Father has sent the Son, has this assurance, he "shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.<a name=217:5></a>" It would be to bring into doubt His own work were Christ to call such in question as to salvation.<a name=217:6></a> He ever keeps distinct His two offices of Life-giver and Judge.<a name=217:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It might appear that in verses 28, 29, He confounds the two.<a name=217:8></a> But is it so?<a name=217:9></a> No, He states a further truth.<a name=217:10></a> He had before been speaking of the quickening of the soul; and now He says, "Marvel not at this," there is going to be a resurrection of the body also.<a name=217:11></a> It is in resurrection that He will fulfil the whole effect and result of His life-giving power.<a name=217:12></a> There will be a "resurrection of life," and also a "resurrection of judgment.<a name=217:13></a>" The two things are kept most definite and distinct.<a name=217:14></a> But the honour of Christ as "Son of man" is secured from all.<a name=217:15></a> We (those who have believed) do not need judgment to oblige us to render Him honour; we honour Him now as the source of life; He has quickened us, forgiven us our sins; through Him we have fellowship with the Father: He has done everything for us.<a name=217:16></a> The wicked shall also honour Him then.<a name=217:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a remarkable passage in Romans 8 in illustration of this distinction.<a name=217:18></a> The apostle, after speaking of the law, takes up the result of the work of Christ, and says, "the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death," etc.<a name=217:19></a>, and then in verse 11, "If the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.<a name=217:20></a>" That will not be true of the wicked at all; they will not be raised in virtue of the Spirit of Christ dwelling in them, they have it not.<a name=217:21></a> We see then, as it were, this great track of life.<a name=217:22></a> Christ is the Life-giver to His people; first to soul, and then to body.<a name=217:23></a>

		A few words more upon the difference between life-giving and judgment.<a name=219:2></a> Now it is that Christ gives life.<a name=219:3></a> When He comes as Judge, He will not give life at all, He will come for judgment.<a name=219:4></a> There is no confounding or mingling of the two things, either as to time or act.<a name=219:5></a> If judgment comes in before grace has given life, who can stand?<a name=219:6></a> Having seen the way of life, there is next the contrast of result, where testimony is not received.<a name=219:7></a> In the fall of our first parents we see sin in three distinct and principal elements.<a name=219:8></a> And these have continued to characterise man ever since.<a name=219:9></a> Man gives ear to Satan, or, in other words, is led of the serpent; exalts himself to be as God; follows his own lusts, and is disobedient.<a name=219:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Scripture gives us the development of this, in principle all through, and shews that it will be so at the end.<a name=219:11></a> Man, whilst in the enjoyment of blessing, listens to and trusts Satan.<a name=219:12></a> But mark the suggestion of the devil, "Ye shall be as gods.<a name=219:13></a>" He can tell truth if it subserve sin.<a name=219:14></a> If we have the truth, nothing can harm us; but Satan can tell truth, a great deal of truth, provided he can only win attention by it and so deceive.<a name=219:15></a> See his temptation of our Lord.<a name=219:16></a> There he quotes Scripture, gives a promise of God, quite rightly applicable in a certain sense, had Jesus listened.<a name=219:17></a> The first Adam did so, and came by the ways of Satan to know good and evil.<a name=219:18></a> But it was by disobedience, and he continued not with God.<a name=219:19></a> Satan told not all the truth -- he did not say, You shall be a lost creature.<a name=219:20></a> Lust worked, disobedience followed, and, consequently, exclusion from God's presence.<a name=219:21></a>

		But testimony of Christ has another element in it.<a name=219:22></a> It is not merely that man is a sinner; there has been the rejection of God in grace.<a name=219:23></a> What was the question when Christ was in the world?<a name=219:24></a> Not whether man had sinned; but would man, a sinner, receive testimony from God in grace?<a name=219:25></a> If you traced the history of man from the beginning until Christ came, you would say, his mouth must be stopped.<a name=219:26></a> Satan's power over the heart is revealed throughout.<a name=219:27></a> Away from Paradise, instead of becoming better, Cain kills his brother.<a name=219:28></a> Then comes the deluge, sweeping away the whole race except eight persons; but afterwards they are as bad as ever.<a name=219:29></a> Noah gets intoxicated, Ham dishonours his father, and after that idolatry enters.<a name=219:30></a>

		MAN'S RESPONSIBILITY AND GOD'S PROMISES
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Galatians 3
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two great points in this chapter: --
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, the effect of the law, when any one is under it;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Second, the contrast between law and promise, and whether it be by law, or by promise, that the blessing of the inheritance is ours.<a name=227:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the early part of the chapter (I do not speak now of the first two or three verses), we are told that the effect of being under the law is to be "under the curse"; in the latter part, we find the blessings of the inheritance ours, not by law, but by promise: "If ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.<a name=227:2></a>" Thus are the counsels of God brought out, and that in a manner that applies itself to the constant tendency of the human heart and its actings, which ever go to exalt man, and to debase God.<a name=227:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is singular the way in which the human heart is continually reasoning within itself, as if there was no distinct revelation from God of His mind -- searching and inquiring in order that it may conclude something about itself and God.<a name=227:4></a> Now it is quite we that the power of grace must work, in order that this revelation should be understood, but it is not merely in the unconverted man there is this reasoning.<a name=227:5></a> Alas!<a name=227:6></a> he often reasons not at all about it, but goes on in his own way, careless, reckless, and unconcerned.<a name=227:7></a> In the heart of the saints there is constant reasoning with regard to their standing before God.<a name=227:8></a> And, in all such cases, it is quite plain that faith is not in exercise.<a name=227:9></a> Whenever I begin to reason on the state of my own soul, faith is not in exercise.<a name=227:10></a> I do not say that the person is not a believer, but I say, faith is not in exercise.<a name=227:11></a> This is quite evident.<a name=227:12></a> Faith receives the testimony of God, and does not reason about it.<a name=227:13></a> There the difficulty lies.<a name=227:14></a> It is not that revelation is not plain, but that the heart of man is not subdued.<a name=227:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not a proof that faith is in exercise when I do not judge myself, because, when I judge myself, I judge myself before the Lord, in order to have removed whatever may be found within me that is wrong in His sight.<a name=227:16></a> Grace enables me to do this.<a name=227:17></a> But whenever there is any reasoning from myself as
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=228>[Page 228]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		to my condition, faith is not in exercise.<a name=228:1></a> It is true this reasoning may follow upon belief in testimony (be, in that sense, a consequence of faith), but it is not faith.<a name=228:2></a> That is, I may believe there is a judgment to come, and that Christ can be my only Saviour (seeing there is not salvation in another, for "there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved"), and I may set about reasoning as to what will be my portion, whether I can say that Christ is my Saviour; but that is not, in itself, any right exercise of faith.<a name=228:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We shall find the testimony of the word of God to be most simple.<a name=228:4></a> Yet, wherever the natural conscience is awakened, there is a certain sense of responsibility to God (indeed that is, in a sense, the awakening of it) -- the knowledge that God takes notice of all that is going on, of what we do, and the like, and that there is a judgment to come.<a name=228:5></a> Therefore the moment a man's conscience is so awakened (the grace of God not being known), he begins to inquire whether his conduct is such as God can approve and accept; and thence he draws some inference as to his own future happiness or misery.<a name=228:6></a> This is the natural state of man -- of every man that thinks about the matter.<a name=228:7></a> But it is, alas!<a name=228:8></a> the real condition too of multitudes of believers in Christ, and of those even who have once known redemption largely.<a name=228:9></a> There is a constant tendency in the heart to turn again to self -- to a condition in which man stands responsible to God.<a name=228:10></a> It is always the case when the soul has got out of the power of the testimony of the Spirit of God as to the completeness of redemption; as also when we have not come to a distinct knowledge of the hopelessness of our condition before God as men.<a name=228:11></a> I say to a distinct knowledge; that is, when the soul has not estimated truthfully the hopelessness of its case, that in the flesh good does not dwell and become fully satisfied that everything -- all the practical righteousness, holiness, or graciousness of the saint -- is consequent upon the introduction of that new thing created in us by the power of God because of the risen Jesus.<a name=228:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We get in these Galatians an example of this, where the soul, after having had the knowledge of grace in Jesus Christ "evidently set forth crucified among them," went back.<a name=228:13></a> They had "begun in the Spirit," and they now thought "in the flesh" to add to what Christ had done.<a name=228:14></a> That is, that they could, by that which is in man, and of man -- the old man
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=229>[Page 229]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		too -- add to that which is of the new man, Christ.<a name=229:1></a> And that, I repeat, beloved, is the constant tendency of the heart.<a name=229:2></a> Wherever there is not the distinct knowledge of the hopelessness of man's condition before God, we go back to get from man something which may be added to what God has given us in the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=229:3></a> John says, "This is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.<a name=229:4></a>" Now if we do not know that the flesh cannot in any way come in and take a share or part in it, we are constantly adding and connecting something of the flesh.<a name=229:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God began by giving "promise.<a name=229:6></a>" And here there was nothing at all of man.<a name=229:7></a> But, because (as we shall see more especially in the latter part of the chapter, where the apostle speaks about promise from God -- promise coming from Him when there was nothing in man to call it out, except, indeed, the ruin and need of man), when He had given the promise, before He had completed that which He had promised -- redemption, before the revelation of Christ, He knew the constant tendency of the human heart to seek to satisfy its own feeling of responsibility, God gave the full extent of His demand upon it, with the consequence of failure.<a name=229:8></a> Because, I say, He knew what was in the heart of man, its tendency from the first -- natural tendency (that is, until redemption and grace are fully known) to judge about itself by itself as to its future state; and also the pride of man, which supposes something in man which can be brought to God, or something from man which can be done for God -- before He did anything for the accomplishment of His promise, He brought in the law, thus trying man in responsibility to the utmost.<a name=229:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is quite right, most assuredly, to be what God has required in His revealed will.<a name=229:10></a> God has required and demanded a certain amount of good in me, and I have the plain revelation of God about it.<a name=229:11></a> Therefore I cannot act as if there were no revelation.<a name=229:12></a> It is one of the sins of the heart of man, that of "intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind," thinking he can approach God by some means of his own devising.<a name=229:13></a> God requires something that is not merely the work of man's hands, something real in the soul, something which has to do with man's relationship to Himself, and to his fellow-creature.<a name=229:14></a> There is this in the law -- the direct requirement of God from man, of what man ought to be towards God and before Him.<a name=229:15></a> That is one way
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=230>[Page 230]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		to take up the law.<a name=230:1></a> And, further, there is the prohibition of what sin had brought in.<a name=230:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are these two things: first, what God requires positively of man, expressed in the summary given by our Lord -- "Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.<a name=230:3></a> This is the first and great commandment.<a name=230:4></a> And the second is like unto it, Thou shall love thy neighbour as thyself"; and then, as the other part, the prohibition of what man was indulging in.<a name=230:5></a> The law presented the requirements of God, that is, supposing man was right practically before God; and took cognizance of what man was not, and prohibited it.<a name=230:6></a> And that is all the law did; except, indeed, to pronounce the curse, if there was failure in the things required.<a name=230:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now as soon as this is tried -- the moment we get here, and see the law in this light -- we find man at once brought in completely hopeless and helpless.<a name=230:8></a> And for this very reason, that he has done the things God forbids.<a name=230:9></a> He is "ungodly," but not only so; he is, moreover, "without strength.<a name=230:10></a>" This is his condition naturally; and the moment there is real desire, and the endeavour, to serve God according to the law, it is found out.<a name=230:11></a> Supposing he desires (which I assume and grace produces it) to serve God, and not to do anything forbidden in the law, he discovers the very principle of his nature to be all wrong.<a name=230:12></a> There is a law in his members, warring against the law of his mind, and bringing him into captivity to the law of sin, which is in his members, which has selfishness for its basis, and corruption for its object.<a name=230:13></a> It is in himself.<a name=230:14></a> Hence the reason that we so often find persons crying out, "O wretched man that I am!<a name=230:15></a>" Moreover, when he comes to see what is in himself, it is that which brings him down into despair.<a name=230:16></a> It is not his past sins -- he could easily suppose God might forgive them, nay, perhaps, that they are forgiven, put away, when he was first converted.<a name=230:17></a> The trial is not there.<a name=230:18></a> But when he feels the principle of those sins to be in himself -- the principle that produced them there still and working in him, now that he lives and "delights in the law of God after the inner man" -- it is this which casts him down.<a name=230:19></a> And cast down he remains until he apprehends the ministry of grace.<a name=230:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, beloved friends, you see God has given law for the prohibition of evil.<a name=230:21></a> And, taking it in that point of view, He gave it to man already in sin.<a name=230:22></a> It came in after two things,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=231>[Page 231]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		evil and the promise.<a name=231:1></a> It was a thing "added because of transgressions, until the seed should come to whom the promise was made" (verse 19), neither the original condition of man, nor the purpose of God about man.<a name=231:2></a> It "came in," it is said (though its elements, no doubt, are everlasting and eternal truth), "by the bye," added because of transgressions.<a name=231:3></a> "The law entered, that the offence might abound," Romans 5: 20.<a name=231:4></a> Hence we are taught, that its object was to make plain and evident -- to discover that perverseness of the will of man, which would never otherwise have been discovered -- the inclination, where there is the knowledge of good, and the desire after good, to do evil; and, therefore, the hopelessness of man's case before God.<a name=231:5></a> Man is concluded under sin (verse 22).<a name=231:6></a> That is the effect of the law.<a name=231:7></a> It was quite clear that man delighted in sin.<a name=231:8></a> Natural conscience sufficed to shew there was sin and guilt.<a name=231:9></a> But then the law came in and was added to these, "that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God," Romans 3: 19.<a name=231:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What is said here?<a name=231:11></a> "As many as are of the works of the law are under the curse," verse 10.<a name=231:12></a> Mark the force of that expression.<a name=231:13></a> It is not, as many as are living in sin, neither yet, merely, as many as are have broken the law (though that is the reason of it); but "as many as are of the works of the law.<a name=231:14></a>" How universal the statement!<a name=231:15></a> It is quite true that man is under "the curse of the law," because he has been the breaker of the law; but it is all who are of the works of the law who are under that curse.<a name=231:16></a> The law was not given to prohibit lust, until man was a wilful creature -- a being in whom lust was found -- until after sin had entered.<a name=231:17></a> I am not now speaking of the law respecting Adam's not eating the fruit, but of the law given by Moses (verse 19).<a name=231:18></a> Coming in at that time, it pronounced the curse upon every one "that continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the law, to do them.<a name=231:19></a>" It took this ground.<a name=231:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And even the very notice in the scripture before us is remarkable.<a name=231:21></a> The apostle says, "for it is written" (verse 10), that is quoting Deuteronomy, where we find (chapter 27) that six tribes were to stand upon mount Gerizim, to bless the people; and six upon mount Ebal, to curse.<a name=231:22></a> But where the details are entered into, there are no tribes mentioned for blessing -- the blessing is not heard at all; it is only the curse.<a name=231:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, "the law entered that the offence might abound"

		<a name=232>[Page 232]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(not that sin might abound: God could not do anything that sin might abound), that is, that the sin already in man's nature might become positively and definitely "transgression.<a name=232:1></a>" The law did not produce sin, but only manifested it.<a name=232:2></a> Let us look at what the apostle says in Romans 7, "What shall we say then?<a name=232:3></a> Is the law sin?<a name=232:4></a> God forbid.<a name=232:5></a> Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law; for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.<a name=232:6></a> But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence.<a name=232:7></a> For without the law sin was dead.<a name=232:8></a> For I was alive without the law once; but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.<a name=232:9></a> And the commandment, which was ordained unto life, I found to be unto death.<a name=232:10></a> For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.<a name=232:11></a> Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.<a name=232:12></a> Was then that which is good made death unto me?<a name=232:13></a> God forbid.<a name=232:14></a> But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good.<a name=232:15></a>" Again, we read in another place (I merely quote it now as regards its application to this part of the subject), "The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law," 1 Corinthians 15: 56.<a name=232:16></a> Directly the law bent down on the conscience, it proved man to be altogether wrong.<a name=232:17></a> Every thought that man had was detected, and the will refusing to submit, its acts became transgression, so that sin by the commandment became "exceeding sinful.<a name=232:18></a>" It produced moreover a great deal more lust in the heart than there was before.<a name=232:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We all know this to be the case.<a name=232:20></a> There is a familiar illustration of it constantly seen in our own houses.<a name=232:21></a> Request your children not to do a certain thing: let it be only not to look into a box (no matter what), and you find that they all long to look into it.<a name=232:22></a> So it is with grown-up persons, they will perversely wish for the forbidden thing, and, what is more, though they may be ashamed of it -- ashamed of the expression of it before men -- the inclination is so great, that, if they could but do it and not be seen, they would not be satisfied until they had.<a name=232:23></a> Just so with the law.<a name=232:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		And now, beloved friends, if that is what the law is, if all who are "of the works of the law are under the curse" -- is that the law for me, to have any righteousness through, in the sight of God?<a name=232:25></a> Never; because the law acts on a nature which is already evil, and therefore it can do nothing but lead to the <a name=233>[Page 233]</a>

		THE CHURCH, AN HABITATION OF GOD THROUGH THE SPIRIT
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ephesians 3
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two great ideas in this epistle as regards the saints.<a name=239:1></a> The grand thought all through it is the grace of God towards them; but, as regards the saints, there are these two ideas about the church: firstly, its hopes; secondly, what it is now meanwhile.<a name=239:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is looked at, on the one hand, as having a certain place in glory, and as enjoying the inheritance; and, on the other, there is this second point, what it is even now before it gets there.<a name=239:3></a> And this last gives it, in a certain sense, a higher character of communion and fellowship in blessing than is contained in the glory itself which it expects, though doubtless the other will not then cease.<a name=239:4></a> You will see these two things in considering the prayers of the apostle (chapters 1 and 3).<a name=239:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We shall be in glory before Him, as children (that is the expression), to bring out the glory of His grace, who had predestinated us according to the good pleasure of His will -- "holy and without blame before him in love.<a name=239:6></a>" And here we have, "In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit" -- before Him in glory -- and God dwelling in us.<a name=239:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We will just consider a little, beloved friends, how it is that the church becomes thus the "habitation of God.<a name=239:8></a>" It is of the deepest importance to us.<a name=239:9></a> I said that the blessings connected with this are in some respects superior to what might properly be called glory.<a name=239:10></a> And this is important, because we find that, even now, this blessing is brought to us.<a name=239:11></a> In glory we shall be able to enjoy it better, but we have it now.<a name=239:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		At the end of chapter 1, where the apostle has been speaking concerning God's purpose about the saints, the thought is the "exceeding greatness of his power," and he prays.<a name=239:13></a> See verse 17-23.<a name=239:14></a> At the close of chapter 3 we have a prayer founded upon the other point I have spoken of.<a name=239:15></a> See verse 14-21.<a name=239:16></a> The character of this prayer is higher, and it goes farther than the former.<a name=239:17></a> There are two titles given to God in this epistle.<a name=239:18></a> In the one He is called the "God of our Lord Jesus Christ," because Christ is looked at there as the glorified Man, who has been down here, suffered, died, and been raised again.<a name=239:19></a> In
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=240>[Page 240]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		the other He is called the "Father of our Lord Jesus Christ," because Christ is not thus looked at as the risen and glorified man, but as the Son of God.<a name=240:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the prayer in chapter 1 is founded upon the first of these titles (verse 17), and is connected with the glory of the risen man.<a name=240:2></a> In chapter 3, the apostle bows his knees unto "the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named," and, therefore, he looks more at intimacy of communion, and to our being "filled to all the fulness of God.<a name=240:3></a>" It is not God giving us knowledge of the inheritance, but God filling us with Himself.<a name=240:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We find these subjects, and the distinction between them, all through.<a name=240:5></a> In the one the Lord Jesus Christ is considered as man, whom God has raised from the dead, and there the church is looked at as "the fulness of him that filleth all in all"; in the other as the Son of the Father in the power and unity of that relationship.<a name=240:6></a> and so of the divine nature; this latter point being more especially connected with our being "an habitation of God through the Spirit.<a name=240:7></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two points in this expression, beloved friends: one, that of our being the "habitation of God"; and the other, that this is "through the Spirit.<a name=240:8></a>" He is not speaking of our dwelling with God (although that is true), but of our being "an habitation of God.<a name=240:9></a>" He says, "ye are builded together," etc.<a name=240:10></a> And this is evidently a different thing.<a name=240:11></a> It is a different thing, our having glory together with Him, and God's dwelling in us.<a name=240:12></a> This is, I repeat, evidently a most peculiar and special blessing.<a name=240:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God came down to talk with man (Genesis 3) -- man already fallen; and "they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day.<a name=240:14></a>" But God then had no "habitation" on earth.<a name=240:15></a> God's Spirit had dealt in power in various ways in the history of man; but the moment the people are called out, it is, "The Lord is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: he is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation," etc.<a name=240:16></a> (Exodus 15: 2.<a name=240:17></a>) This is the first thing we find in the song of Moses.<a name=240:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Beloved friends, it is touching to see the place which God takes (referring to the passage I have quoted about David's thought of building a house), according to the state of His people.<a name=241:8></a> God always takes the place that suits His people: a marvellous thought, but a most gracious one on His part!<a name=241:9></a> If His people are enslaved under burdens as in Egypt, He becomes their redeemer.<a name=241:10></a> If they are a journeying people and in tents, He dwells there Himself.<a name=241:11></a> He takes the same place as His people, for He is to be the centre of their blessing, and leads them by the cloud.<a name=241:12></a> This He did up to Solomon's time.<a name=241:13></a> When Joshua comes in and has to fight with the Canaanites, He presents Himself as "captain of the Lord's host," Joshua 5.<a name=241:14></a> When the people are settled (settled as far as they could be in their fleshly condition) under Solomon in fulness of peace and in blessing, God builds a settled house.<a name=241:15></a> And God dwells among them.<a name=241:16></a> Whatever the circumstances His people are in, God takes a place suited to them.<a name=241:17></a>

		If it is really true, that God dwells on the earth in a "habitation," evidently the "habitation" wherein He dwells must be of the greatest importance.<a name=242:1></a> And this remains always true.<a name=242:2></a> Failure though there may be, still the church is His dwelling place.<a name=242:3></a> Until Christ came, or, at any rate, until Lo-ammi was pronounced upon Israel at the Babylonish captivity, God dwelt there, and the blessing of the people and the guilt of the people were in respect of God's dwelling.<a name=242:4></a> If it was a question of idolatry, "they have set (He says) their altars by my altar.<a name=242:5></a>" So when He is going to judge the people in Ezekiel, He goes on, and shews the prophet what they were doing in the temple.<a name=242:6></a> It might be the ancients of the house of Israel in the chambers of imagery; or women weeping for Tammuz or the men at the door of the temple of the Lord between the porch and the altar, with their backs towards the temple of the Lord, and their faces towards the east, worshipping the sun; but it was in the temple.<a name=242:7></a> This was the place to which sin referred itself.<a name=242:8></a> Having stated this general truth, I would now just see here how this "habitation" is brought about.<a name=242:9></a>

		All the first chapter of the epistle, as also the beginning of the second, is taken up with the other point of which I spoke, that is, that God has raised up Christ from the dead; as it is said, "according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Christ, when," etc.<a name=242:10></a> God is here in power stepping in (not merely a judge having satisfaction, but in His own power stepping in for the accomplishment of His purposes) to deal with man looked at as under the consequences of sin.<a name=242:11></a> It is not only man in evil that is looked at in this epistle responsible to God, and having to find that which meets his state in the cross (we see that in Hebrews, and elsewhere, it is not specially treated of here), but it is God acting in His own power (when man was on this ground -- in utter ruin) for the deliverance of man.<a name=242:12></a> Christ takes this place.<a name=242:13></a> He descends into the lower parts of the earth, making Himself responsible for the consequences of sin.<a name=242:14></a> He descends into the whole consequences of sin -- He comes down from the throne of God in the perfectness of divine love, humbles Himself, takes upon Him, and comes down into, the consequences of sin where man had brought himself.<a name=242:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All that which the heart of Christ felt and suffered is told out wonderfully in the Psalms: whether it be from the hiding of God's countenance, or from His enemies surrounding Him, or from Satan's power, or from God's waves and billows going over Him, all is freely expressed there.<a name=243:5></a> Occasionally we find this breaking forth in the gospels, but it is more especially given in the Psalms.<a name=243:6></a> What the gospels present to us, generally speaking, is the perfect walk of Christ -- of Him, who, by virtue of His living by the Father, and His perfect obedience and love, was always towards man, what man needed in order to approach God; man could see all that, while His thoughts about that which pressed upon Him were hidden within His own heart.<a name=243:7></a> "I have a baptism to be baptised with, and how am I straitened until it be accomplished!<a name=243:8></a>" Constantly His soul was straitened, whilst, if you look at Him among men, they were not straitened in Him; all was grace and love still.<a name=243:9></a> He shewed forth the great principle of the offering up of Himself as man to God.<a name=243:10></a> He had power to take that place, and He took it.<a name=243:11></a> Though without sin, He suffered all the consequences of sin, even to "the dust of death"; He went down into it.<a name=243:12></a> But there He could not remain.<a name=243:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having thus perfectly glorified God, it then became a question what God should do for Him.<a name=243:14></a> And we read, "He raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places," etc.<a name=243:15></a> "He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.<a name=243:16></a>" Having descended, in the perfectness of love and obedience, to the dust of death, He went thence back to the throne of God and is set above all.<a name=243:17></a> And thus, whatever exercise of heart there may be, or whatever the evil and rebellion of unconverted man, faith knows perfectly that from the throne of God down to the uttermost consequences of sin, and from

		the uttermost consequences of sin up to the throne of God, Christ fills all things.<a name=244:1></a> There is not one thing to the eye of faith, from the throne of God to the dust of death, and from that up to the highest point of glory, that is not filled with the redemption power of Christ.<a name=244:2></a> The love of God has come down into the place of the sin and ruin of man; and faith rests in that love, and in the full accomplishment of redemption, as shewn out in that He who went down into the dust of death is now at the right hand of the throne of God.<a name=244:3></a> "He that descended," etc.<a name=244:4></a> Woe be to those who reject this!<a name=244:5></a> but that is what faith knows about the work of Christ.<a name=244:6></a> He has gone down into the dust of death, and the "exceeding greatness" of God's power has raised him from the dead; chapter 1: 19, 20.<a name=244:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is the redemption power of God.<a name=244:8></a> The results, it is true, will be brought out afterwards; God is waiting, and souls are being gathered unto Christ; but that is the redemption in the power of which we stand.<a name=244:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, now, the consequence of that is seen in the second chapter: "You hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins"; and then too (because God has done it for us in Christ), He "hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.<a name=244:10></a>" The great result of this salvation will be our being with Christ in the glory by and by; but even now, by faith, we can see ourselves "in Christ Jesus" (not "with" Him, as has been observed) there.<a name=244:11></a> I know that the redemption power which has visited me touched me, and has taken me up, when I was "dead in trespasses and sins.<a name=244:12></a>" I know that this has not stopped short of the throne of God itself.<a name=244:13></a> It has united me to Him who is at the right hand of God, and has therefore placed me there "in" Him, as having the same life, the same righteousness (God's righteousness now), and hereafter the same joy, and the same glory.<a name=244:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This would have been true if there were but one saint.<a name=244:15></a> But there is a further thing.<a name=244:16></a> The apostle goes on to shew that, looked at according to the largeness of the purpose of God, Jew and Gentile (whatever the distinction between them, and that of God, "in the flesh") were on one broad platform of ruin -- "among whom we all had our conversation in times past, in the lusts of our flesh," etc.<a name=244:17></a> Having taken that ground, he says, "remember" where you are -- "He is our peace," etc.<a name=244:18></a> (See verse 11-17.<a name=244:19></a>) "Peace" having been made, the

	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		dealings of God with man down here on the ground of redemption are begun.<a name=245:1></a> Christ sat down on the throne of God, having completed the work -- the peace being made -- redemption accomplished.<a name=245:2></a> He could not go farther than the throne of God.<a name=245:3></a> He has carried the "wave-sheaf," the first-fruits of redemption-power in His own Person up to the throne of God.<a name=245:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, on this the "peace" that is "preached" is based.<a name=245:5></a> And here I would just for a moment (supposing there may be some here who have not peace) notice how it is that He preaches peace.<a name=245:6></a> He does not come and say to man, You have to make your peace with God.<a name=245:7></a> He preaches peace.<a name=245:8></a> He does not preach a peace to be made -- a peace that is not made.<a name=245:9></a> He preaches peace, a made peace.<a name=245:10></a> He has "made peace through the blood of his cross," having sat down at the right hand of God, the whole work being accomplished, so that He is "expecting until his enemies are made his footstool," Hebrews 10.<a name=245:11></a> He comes to Jew and Gentile, no matter to whom, and preaches peace -- not a progressive work, but a peace completely made.<a name=245:12></a> The soul may be a long while struggling under the sense of unanswered responsibility, it may ding to the law, it may mistake the work of the Spirit for the work of Christ, be looking for results in itself (we naturally look to our own righteousness, and even the saints often mistake holiness for the ground of peace), and the like: all that may take place in the soul, but it does not at all touch the perfectness of the work of Christ, or alter the strain of what Christ preaches as being at the right hand of God.<a name=245:13></a> Blessed thought!<a name=245:14></a> It is simple enough, and there is nothing more suitable.<a name=245:15></a> For, as we shall see (without the thought of holiness having anything to do with the ground of peace), holiness flows forth as the consequence of peace.<a name=245:16></a> Wherever there is simplicity of faith, there is peace.<a name=245:17></a> That is the first point -- perfect peace, independent of anything in ourselves.<a name=245:18></a> No matter what we were, Jew or Gentile, sinners or honourable in the earth, it is a peace that has been brought to us in Christ.<a name=245:19></a> The next thing (and that as a consequence) is, that "through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father," verse 18.<a name=245:20></a>

		"Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners," etc.<a name=245:21></a> (verse 19-22).<a name=245:22></a> Christ, having wrought this redemption, having ascended to God, having sat down at the right hand of God, having gathered us together, makes us, thus gathered <a name=246>[Page 246]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		together, "an habitation of God through the Spirit.<a name=246:1></a>" It is not God merely acting in certain men; it is God dwelling in the church down here, as gathered through the word of the gospel.<a name=246:2></a> The church is the place of God's presence on the earth.<a name=246:3></a> He has set us in redemption, and He comes and dwells in us.<a name=246:4></a> When the church was gathered together with one accord in one place, at Pentecost, the Holy Ghost came down and dwelt there, the result of the accomplished work of Jesus.<a name=246:5></a> And this is a real thing.<a name=246:6></a> I am not speaking now merely of gifts, but of the presence of God Himself.<a name=246:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now it is quite clear that the presence of God down here must be of the last importance.<a name=246:8></a> His "habitation" is that which He possesses, which belongs to Him, and nothing that does not recognise the fulness of this blessed cost of salvation, can be.<a name=246:9></a> It is those who are His redeemed ones, brought together by the peace which Christ preaches, those who have, through Christ, access by one Spirit unto the Father, that come to be the place where God dwells.<a name=246:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are many places in which the Spirit of God could act.<a name=246:11></a> We find the expression, "The eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect towards him," 2 Chronicles 16: 9.<a name=246:12></a> If we turn to certain dealings of God as assuring the work He established by His Spirit, for instance the laying the foundation of the temple by Zerubbabel (Zechariah 3, 4), we there find mention of these "eyes of the Lord.<a name=246:13></a>" So in Ezekiel's throne (chapter 1: 18; chapter 10: 12), the operations of God in His governing power in the world.<a name=246:14></a> See, too, Revelation 5: 6.<a name=246:15></a> All this is the activity of energy of the Spirit of God.<a name=246:16></a> It might act in glorious power, or it might act in silent energy, but in all it is the activity of energy of the Spirit of God going out and dealing in the world, and is quite another thing.<a name=246:17></a> I am not speaking of that.<a name=246:18></a> We are "an habitation of God through the Spirit," in grace to us: it may be a tabernacle, but still it is "an habitation of God" -- the place where He dwells, where He lives, so to speak, where He has taken up His abode, where He can have around Him the things that suit His presence, that in which He delights.<a name=246:19></a> Beloved friends, this is what we are; we may have dishonoured it, but that is just what we are made, and in this world -- the place where God dwells.<a name=246:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now to take a simple example of the effect of this (I said a

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=247>[Page 247]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		simple example, and yet it is a very important one), let us look at the case of Ananias and Sapphira (Acts 5).<a name=247:1></a> That was not a question of gift.<a name=247:2></a> Peter said, "Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost?<a name=247:3></a>" God was there; there was no gift exercised at all; and Ananias and Sapphira fell down dead.<a name=247:4></a> They had had the folly and madness not to understand that God was there, and therefore, when they came and brought only part of the price of the possession, lying to God (it was not to Peter and John they were lying), God shewed the indignation of His presence, and they fell down dead.<a name=247:5></a> There was wonderful effect in this: we read, "And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things," etc.<a name=247:6></a> The fact was known that God did "in very deed (as Solomon speaks at the dedication of the temple) dwell with men.<a name=247:7></a>" It was the real presence of God -- the church was there, having God dwelling in it, and acting in it, by the Holy Ghost -- and He proved it; His presence sanctified the place.<a name=247:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, beloved friends, that is always and constantly true.<a name=247:9></a> As I have said, we may have grieved the Spirit, dishonoured the house, and been unfaithful (that alas!<a name=247:10></a> is also too true), but it depends upon the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.<a name=247:11></a> What is the consequence of redemption?<a name=247:12></a> It is not merely that I have peace individually, nor yet that we are heirs together of glory, nor yet that we have access through Christ by the Spirit to the Father; besides all this, it is the ground on which God dwells down here.<a name=247:13></a> It is in virtue of the accomplishment of redemption by the Lord Jesus Christ that God can come down here, and make His "habitation," that He can comfort and strengthen those who are within (not merely act in providential power without), that He can be at home in the midst of His people.<a name=247:14></a> This, His being at home in the midst of His people, practically sanctifies us; it involves great responsibility: His house should be according to His holiness.<a name=247:15></a> "Holiness becometh thy house for ever.<a name=247:16></a>" But, at the same time, it becomes the source of our power and blessing.<a name=247:17></a>

		Suppose, for a moment, God was here, and we were all His saints (the Lord grant it may be so!<a name=247:18></a>) and all the saints of God that are in the world were here (which is not the case, God forbid that it should be!<a name=247:19></a>) is it not quite evident that the eye, the ear, all would refer to that, that every movement would be consequent upon God's being there, the presence of God

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, we are "builded together for an habitation of God.<a name=248:9></a>" And see what a blessed truth is connected with this.<a name=248:10></a> On what ground could God come into our midst and dwell with us?<a name=248:11></a> It is not on any uncertain ground.<a name=248:12></a> It is upon the ground of God's perfect and entire complacency in the church -- His perfect delight.<a name=248:13></a> It is not God's coming down to call us, as He did Adam after the fall, in order to find out that he was lost.<a name=248:14></a> Neither is it God's coming down, as He did to Sodom and Gomorrah, to see whether the cry that has gone up is such as it seems to be.<a name=248:15></a> Neither is it God's coming down, as He did to Israel, to put to the test whether He can stay.<a name=248:16></a> He comes down on the ground, and in consequence of, completed redemption -- of peace being perfectly made.<a name=248:17></a> His presence is the witness and evidence of accomplished redemption.<a name=248:18></a> He says, as it were, I have so accomplished this redemption, I am so pleased with you, so satisfied because of Jesus, that I am come to dwell with you, to make My abode with you: you are to be My "habitation.<a name=248:19></a>" What a character does this give to the church!<a name=248:20></a> What manner of men ought we to be?<a name=248:21></a>

		But then there is another thing.<a name=248:22></a> If we are the "habitation of God through the Spirit," the consequence is, not merely the favour of God, but all the consequences of this favour.<a name=248:23></a> The Holy Ghost comes down as the witness and testimony of the fulness of the Father's delight in Christ and of our joy in Him.<a name=248:24></a> "Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come," etc.<a name=248:25></a> (John 16: 13-15).<a name=248:26></a> He ministers (I am not now talking of the instruments) to us these things.<a name=248:27></a> He has all "the goods (as it is expressed of Eliezer, Genesis 24) in his hand," to minister the comfort and strength of what belongs to us as the bride of Christ, the true Isaac, unto whom the Father hath given all that He hath.<a name=248:28></a> And that is the case in the midst of infinite difficulty and trials (in that sense more blessed than if there

	<div class="paragraph">
		As the apostle speaks in the Philippians, "What then?<a name=249:5></a> notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.<a name=249:6></a> For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.<a name=249:7></a>" Paul was tried, persecuted, taken as a prisoner to Rome, and they were going on preaching Christ of envy and strife, supposing to add affliction to his bonds, etc.<a name=249:8></a> Well, all this, he says, will "turn to my salvation," etc.<a name=249:9></a> His soul thus being fed and nourished by the Spirit, everything in which he found trial and exercise of heart became but the means really of working out of him that which was contrary to God, in order that his sympathy might have free course, and his soul joy only in Christ.<a name=249:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, beloved friends, in speaking of the sympathy of the Spirit of God with the saints, and in the saints amidst a groaning creation (Romans 8), he says, "Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities," etc.<a name=249:11></a> (verse 26).<a name=249:12></a> Here I find the Holy Ghost taking notice of certain trials, sorrows, weaknesses, difficulties, and the like, of everything, in short, that can press upon the heart of the saint, and that even when it "cannot be uttered," and "groaning" is its only expression.<a name=249:13></a> It is the groaning of the Spirit of God in such a poor feeble heart, that it does not know how to express it.<a name=249:14></a> But it is said, "And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth," etc.<a name=249:15></a> (verse 27).<a name=249:16></a> That is what He has found there -- "the mind of the Spirit.<a name=249:17></a>" It is not merely that human feelings are brought out, but that the things (the very trials and sorrows) that would have produced human feelings, have now produced, if I may so say, divine feelings -- feelings "according to God," which go up to God, and which God can answer; so that they become the means by which He pours into the heart all the fulness of His consolation, not perhaps taking them away, but shewing that He Himself is the sufficient blessing of the soul, because He dwells with it,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the prayer in chapter 3 the apostle loses himself, as it were, and no wonder.<a name=250:4></a> After he has said, "I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ," he adds, "that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man; that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love [that is what God is -- the divine nature], may be able to comprehend with all saints [taking in the whole unity in which the Holy Ghost dwells], what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height" -- he has now got into the infinitude of all God's thoughts and purposes of blessing, and he cannot say of what.<a name=250:5></a> Just as the groanings could not be uttered, so the thought cannot be uttered.<a name=250:6></a> It is God that has come in, and Christ fills all things according to the power of redemption, from the throne of God, down to the dust of death, and from the dust of death up to the throne of God.<a name=250:7></a> Having all things, and filling all things (he says), here I am placed, in the midst of this infinitude.<a name=250:8></a> And then he adds, "and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge.<a name=250:9></a>" He could go to no place, but there he found infinite love and infinite power -- the love that brought Christ down, and the power that took Christ up again.<a name=250:10></a>

		When there has been a going on altogether without God, I do not call this a high bearing before God, though it is so in another sense.<a name=253:7></a> We all know how many people go on carelessly, day after day, and year after year, without troubling themselves about God, seeking joy and pleasure in the world, sunk in listlessness, oppressed with cares, or engrossed with business: a thousand things fill and occupy the natural heart to the exclusion of God.<a name=253:8></a> Sometimes it does cross the conscience that there is a God, but, so far from His being the object of their life, He is not their object at all -- "God is not in all their thoughts.<a name=253:9></a>" There may be these secret misgivings (God often works thus in the hearts of those whom He afterwards calls to Himself, although not producing fruit through it at the time); and, when the soul is converted, the remembrance of such appeals aids in bringing to a consciousness of the total and entire perverseness of the will of man.<a name=253:10></a> Where there is open and notorious sin, it is an easier thing to reach the conscience, just as the Lord said to the Pharisees, the religious people of the day, "The publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.<a name=253:11></a>" Often, in the course of a comparatively blameless life, there have been these calls, and God, in the riches of His goodness and forbearance and long-suffering, has been despised.<a name=253:12></a>

		But there is quite a different state of soul from this, a confidence out of God's presence.<a name=256:18></a> The soul may think and reason about the ground of Christian confidence, and Christian privilege, just as did these Israelites that they were owned of God.<a name=256:19></a> Theirs was a carnal confidence.<a name=256:20></a> It was just the taking up of general principles of truth as to God's dealings with His people, and then going on in fleshly assumption.<a name=256:21></a> This brought them to murmur and rebel.<a name=256:22></a> They came up with confidence that the Lord was with them; but the Lord gave directions respecting Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, and interfered in judgment upon their ungodliness.<a name=256:23></a> And then we read, "But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of

		Now what is the remedy of the Lord for this?<a name=257:2></a> He sets up priesthood, as the only ground on which He can go on with them.<a name=257:3></a> He says, as it were, 'I must have clear and plain evidence what My power is, in order to make cease from Me the murmurings of the children of Israel; but then, if I give this evidence of My power, it must be in grace; to deal with them on any other ground than that of grace would be for destruction.<a name=257:4></a>' And such must always be the case.<a name=257:5></a> If the Lord were simply to come by the power of His actual presence, it would bring confusion into the soul.<a name=257:6></a> Sometimes we see this on a death-bed for a little moment.<a name=257:7></a> In what the Lord thus does in bringing the soul into His presence, He puts it under a shade of the power of that which Christ went through -- just a shade of it.<a name=257:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The truth is, that, in the way in which many believers are occupied in daily life, they little realise the presence of God.<a name=257:9></a> It is not that they have not peace, but that they never fully estimate what the flesh is before God.<a name=257:10></a> One learns this from intercourse with Christians, and specially with those who have been long Christians.<a name=257:11></a> They know very little what it is to find themselves face to face with God.<a name=257:12></a> They may have been awakened under convictions of sin (perhaps terrible convictions), and have got peace to their souls; but since that there may have been the going on comfortably with certain things, without a realising of the presence of God, so that if it were to come on them, they too would be "consumed" with terror.<a name=257:13></a> It is well for us to remember that certainty as to salvation is the proper, the normal state of a Christian.<a name=257:14></a> I repeat this here, just to shew that what I am now saying is not meant to deny it at all; but still I say that if God were to meet such persons, real Christians though they were, in the present power of what He is as God, it would produce trouble and distress.<a name=257:15></a> This ought not so to be.<a name=257:16></a> It is quite clear that, if it is the case, we are not really living in His presence, and that is the place where we are privileged to be.<a name=257:17></a> There is a constant tendency in our hearts, when out of it, to be taken up with certain things that are grounded upon what is truly our relationship to God, and to carry on these things without realising His presence.<a name=257:18></a> Now, if confidence goes along with this, it is a most hardening thing.<a name=257:19></a> Confidence, I repeat, ought always to be the portion

		Now I do not say that it will come to this point in our hearts, but (the same thing in principle) it will be for discouragement, for loss of confidence, and for distrust of God.<a name=258:9></a> Suppose you, a real Christian, had been going on in carelessness, and carrying this carnal confidence along with it; and one were to speak to you even of the intercession of Jesus, if there was a sense of God's presence through this to your soul, it would not be a cheering and strengthening but rather a discouraging thing, and the soul would break down.<a name=258:10></a> Our place with the Lord is to walk with joy, but it is joy in the Lord.<a name=258:11></a> Enoch "walked with God.<a name=258:12></a>" Can you say you are walking with God?<a name=258:13></a> I do not ask if you are doing that which is openly wrong; but would the presence of God alarm and distress you?<a name=258:14></a> Our confidence, if we have any, is a fleshly thing, when that is the case.<a name=258:15></a>

		If all things were not entirely out of course, every principle of human nature astray from God, there would be no need for all the painstaking on the part of God of which we read in these chapters (and that after all with such strange results), no need of these, in one sense, sorrowful and assiduous efforts to call people back unto Himself.<a name=264:1></a> We might have supposed, as we sometimes see in the case of a self-willed child, that the moment the father's voice of love and entreaty was heard, instant obedience would be produced, because a sense of relationship was there.<a name=264:2></a> But no; these constant efforts, this "changing of the voice" (as Paul has it), serve but to shew that all sense of relationship between man and God is gone.<a name=264:3></a> That voice touches no spring, there is not a chord upon which He can act -- the echo of the heart is gone.<a name=264:4></a> Where there is the appearance of an answer, it is but hypocrisy.<a name=264:5></a> I am not saying that God cannot change the heart, but that there is entire alienation of the heart from God.<a name=264:6></a> The Lord in these chapters goes through these various efforts and their result in a very full and distinct manner indeed, both as regards the responsibility of man and the actings of His own grace; and He does it in the simplest way by appealing to man's conscience just as he is.<a name=264:7></a>

		We read, "And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority doest thou these things?<a name=264:8></a> and who gave thee this authority?<a name=264:9></a>" (verse 23).<a name=264:10></a> God comes into the world to do good, and man asks by what authority God does good in the world!<a name=264:11></a> Jesus had been shewing His power previously (verse 12-14), but now He was quietly teaching in the temple.<a name=264:12></a> They were vexed to see the veil of hypocrisy drawn aside, and the finger of God put forth in the cleansing of the temple from these things by means of which they had made it a house of merchandise, and therefore they ask Him this question.<a name=264:13></a> The Lord appeals to no miracle -- He has done plenty, but He appeals not to miracles.<a name=264:14></a> "Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things.<a name=264:15></a> The baptism of John, whence was it; from heaven or of men?<a name=264:16></a> And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe him?<a name=264:17></a> [for John bore testimony to Jesus].<a name=264:18></a> But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people: for all hold John as a prophet" (verse 24-26).<a name=264:19></a>

		That is, He at once, by means of the question which in divine wisdom He puts to them in reply, brings out the real state of their conscience.<a name=265:1></a> "And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell.<a name=265:2></a> And he said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things" (verse 27).<a name=265:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus, at the very outset, He puts this great truth before all, that the conscience of man is bad in not submitting to the righteousness of God.<a name=265:4></a> And that is the case always.<a name=265:5></a> Man cannot deny that things come from heaven, but he will not believe.<a name=265:6></a> If pressed to the utmost (look at the extreme case of infidelity), men love darkness rather than light, just as it is said, "Even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind," etc.<a name=265:7></a> (Romans 1).<a name=265:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having laid down this in direct application to their own conscience, He could now tell them that which follows, "But what think ye?<a name=265:9></a> A certain man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work today in my vineyard.<a name=265:10></a> He answered and said, I will not; but afterwards he repented and went.<a name=265:11></a> And he came to the second, and said likewise.<a name=265:12></a> And he answered and said, I go, sir: and went not.<a name=265:13></a> Whether of them twain did the will of his father?<a name=265:14></a> They say unto him, The first.<a name=265:15></a> Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.<a name=265:16></a> For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that ye might believe him" (verse 28-32).<a name=265:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this first parable the Lord puts a case according to the difference there is between formal righteousness and the repentant sinner; between the person who goes through the world decently, desiring to make a fair appearance, and the one who, acting against all the dictates of natural conscience, sins wilfully, and then repents.<a name=265:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the second son we have that which is descriptive of the general character of 'decent' people.<a name=265:19></a> They go on quietly and in outward order, professing to own the will of God, and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the other son there was the positive delight in doing his own will (just, alas!<a name=266:2></a> the description of the wilfulness of the human heart: he said, "I will not"), delight in breaking through all righteousness as it regarded the relationship between himself and his father, but withal the consciousness of this, and the owning afterwards that it had been broken through (not merely that he had done a wrong thing, but that he had disobeyed the father), and repentance on account of it.<a name=266:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There was no regard in the self-righteous Jew, with all his profession, for the righteousness of God; but the publicans and the harlots believed John.<a name=266:4></a> Now there was no regard in the former for the ordinances of God; in the latter there was no regard for the common decencies of life, but when they heard the ministry of John, who came in the way of righteousness, they repented; and this repentance, touching the root of all sin, referred itself, not merely to acts of sin, but towards the Person sinned against.<a name=266:5></a> The one decently owned God, and left it there.<a name=266:6></a> The others indecently and outrageously sinned against God, but "repented, and went.<a name=266:7></a>" They recognised not merely certain particular faults, sins in conduct, but sin against God, that they had failed in rendering that which was due to God.<a name=266:8></a> We see then that the only repentance which God owns is that in which there is the recognition of sin, and the recognition of Himself as the One against whom we have sinned.<a name=266:9></a> The state that the publicans and harlots were in brought them to this certainty, that if God spoke, they had nothing to say for themselves, there was nothing which they could do, except indeed to put their hand, as Job says, upon their mouth, and say, "I am vile.<a name=266:10></a>" And this they did, whilst the scribes and Pharisees remained as insensible as possible, not only to God's word, but also to the full operation of God's grace; they were as insensible to it as if there had been no such thing.<a name=266:11></a> This is the first part, the first case of God's dealings with man, brought before us by our Lord here.<a name=266:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We next get certain dealings on the ground of responsibility, then dealings on the ground of grace: the one in the latter part of chapter 21, the other in the early part of chapter 22.<a name=266:13></a> First, as to responsibility the Lord says, "Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a wine-press in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country: and when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it" (verse 33, 34).<a name=266:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=267>[Page 267]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is quite clear that this applies to the Jewish people in the first place; yet as to the general principle of the parable it is true of all who have heard the name of Christ and have refused to believe in Him.<a name=267:1></a> It is not merely a case of relationship, as between a son and a father (that we have seen before), but it contains an appeal to the conscience of persons on the ground of certain things God has done.<a name=267:2></a> It was God that had planted the vineyard, hedged it round about, digged the winepress in it, built the tower, let it out to husbandmen.<a name=267:3></a> He had put this vineyard into the hands of certain persons, and having done much for it (everything that He had done for the Jews, as we see in Isaiah 5: 2, almost in the same words), He naturally looked that it should bring forth grapes to Him.<a name=267:4></a> So it is, as to the general principle, in Christianity.<a name=267:5></a> It is not a question of natural conscience merely; God had let something out to husbandmen.<a name=267:6></a> This was a new thing.<a name=267:7></a> He did not leave men to the light of their natural conscience.<a name=267:8></a> He had taken the greatest possible pains with them, done everything, so that He says, "What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it?<a name=267:9></a> and then, putting them on the ground of responsibility, He comes looking for fruit.<a name=267:10></a> We shall see just now that God has abandoned this ground.<a name=267:11></a> He produces fruit, but He has abandoned the ground of seeking for fruit.<a name=267:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God had done everything possible for the Jewish people as His vineyard, and then the thing that He naturally looked for from them was that they should bring forth grapes.<a name=267:13></a> He sent the prophets first (the way the prophets are looked at here is, that they were seeking fruit), "and the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.<a name=267:14></a> Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise.<a name=267:15></a> But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son," verse 35, 37.<a name=267:16></a> We find Christ Himself taking them up upon this ground.<a name=267:17></a> He came (though not as to ultimate result or purpose) to seek for fruit in His vineyard (it is not a question of grace), and having come to seek fruit, they say, We will get rid of this Son.<a name=267:18></a> "When the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance.<a name=267:19></a> And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him," verse 38, 39.<a name=267:20></a>

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=268>[Page 268]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The end of responsibility, and of all this patient dealing of God with the Jewish people on that ground was, that they were glad of the occasion to kill the Heir, in order that they might seize upon the inheritance.<a name=268:1></a> "When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do unto those husbandmen?<a name=268:2></a> They say unto him, he will miserably destroy those wicked men," etc.<a name=268:3></a> (verse 40, 41).<a name=268:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here then again we mark this great principle, that in whatever way God looks for a response from man He finds none.<a name=268:5></a> There is such a thing as God's looking for fruit from that which He has planted and nurtured in the world, but there is no fruit to be had from man towards God.<a name=268:6></a> The husbandmen's will was entirely against it.<a name=268:7></a> They did not recognise the authority of God in His vineyard: they liked to have it for themselves.<a name=268:8></a> The will was entirely and absolutely wrong.<a name=268:9></a> The truth was, the husbandmen were opposed to the planter of the vineyard, and therefore the relationship was not owned, etc.<a name=268:10></a> The effect of the ordinances God had given was only that of bringing out the enmity and hatred of those to whom He had entrusted His vineyard.<a name=268:11></a> The Lord ends this part of man's history with the question of seeking fruit and finding none.<a name=268:12></a> He places man in a certain religious position, giving him many external advantages, and looks consequently for fruit.<a name=268:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, beloved friends, there are many hearts looking at that as their position: the ground they are dealing upon with God is that of seeking to return fruit.<a name=268:14></a> They feel that God has given them certain spiritual advantages, opportunities of hearing, and the like, and that therefore they ought to return fruit to Him.<a name=268:15></a> And so they ought.<a name=268:16></a> But then, although such are not in a condition of soul answerable to that of the husbandmen who killed the heir, they have mistaken, and that altogether, the ground on which God is dealing.<a name=268:17></a> And it does not stop here, I for the soul may even deal with Christ Himself as with one who is seeking fruit, just as much as with the law and the prophets.<a name=268:18></a> It sees in the perfectness of Christ a claim, in the love of God a claim.<a name=268:19></a> It thinks that if God has so loved as to give His Son, if Christ has so loved as to shed His blood, there must be this claim of fruit from it to God.<a name=268:20></a> Most truly there is, in one sense, but claim does not produce fruit.<a name=268:21></a> Surely there must
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=269>[Page 269]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		be fruit found in every believer; but if we stand before God on the ground of having to meet His claim, it is all over with us.<a name=269:1></a> It is a very different thing whether there is the claim of fruit, or whether fruit is produced through the work of the Spirit on the soul.<a name=269:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And further I would say, that where there is honesty and sincerity of heart, and the conscience is touched with the testimony to the love of God, seeing the infinite greatness of that love as manifested in the Son of God having come down from heaven to die upon the cross, in the way of claim the only effect is to make it say, Well, it is all over with me if there is no return!<a name=269:3></a> And so it is all over with it on that ground.<a name=269:4></a> I repeat, the soul sees the love, but it sees also the infinite claim that that love has upon it, and therefore that all is over with it, and it feels no hope.<a name=269:5></a> All this is upon the ground that God is claiming fruit.<a name=269:6></a> There is the sense of God's amazing love in giving His Son to death for sinners; the soul sees His graciousness in this, and feels that it ought, in return for this love, to produce the fruit that God is looking for, but that it does not; consequently all this exercise of soul ends in nothing but the sense of deserved condemnation and judgment.<a name=269:7></a> Claim on a person always results in judgment to that person, if he is unable to meet it.<a name=269:8></a> If God is dealing with us in the way of claim against us, the result of that is to bring us in guilty in not having answered at all to the claim which God has against us.<a name=269:9></a> We have made of the love of God in Christ a severer and more terrible law than that given by Moses, when the soul puts itself under claim to that love; and therefore we feel condemned and get into despondency.<a name=269:10></a> The Lord has tried man by the law, and it has ended in nothing but judgment.<a name=269:11></a> The more you elevate the claim of God, the more you elevate your own condemnation.<a name=269:12></a> If you put the love of God in the place of law, the greater the love that has been manifested, the more guilty are you in rejecting the claims of that love.<a name=269:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This parable then brings before us, not the question of God's dealing with the natural conscience of man, neither that of the owner of the vineyard looking for and not receiving fruit (the Lord has closed that altogether with the last chapter), but that of the king acting according to the riches of his own house in order to glorify his son.<a name=270:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This was the very thought of the king in preparing the supper.<a name=270:11></a> Was it merely that he was going to make certain people comfortable?<a name=270:12></a> No; it was about his son.<a name=270:13></a> And in order to glorify that son he must have full blessing at the table -- what shall I say?<a name=270:14></a> happy faces around it, hearts without one care, without any shade of anxiety upon them, free from every suspicion of his love.<a name=270:15></a> The "marriage" of his son must be honoured in having all these things accompanying it.<a name=270:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The application of the parable is as simple as possible: and that is the ground on which God is dealing in the gospel, and not as claiming fruit.<a name=270:17></a> I do not say He does not produce fruit, but it is not a ground of claim in any shape.<a name=270:18></a> Man has failed altogether, not only in not producing fruit, but also in not owning the claim which God has upon him; and if he does own the claim, he gets into despair on account of it.<a name=270:19></a> I have put that case.<a name=270:20></a> But now all this is over, entirely over, and God is set forth as glorifying Himself in having others made happy around His Son.<a name=270:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		If I speak one word, or have a thought about claim, in connection with the ground of my standing in the presence of God (though I admit the principle most fully), it destroys the

		whole ground upon which God is acting in the fulness of His grace.<a name=271:1></a> It is quite clear that one who had allowed for a moment the thought of having to provide his share of the feast could have no real sense of the honour of the person who invited him to the feast (the man who had brought it would have been kept at the door); there would have been the entire undervaluing both of him who had made the supper, and of the supper.<a name=271:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And it is also true, moreover, that if a guest who had been invited by the king were a rich man, and sought to come in in costly raiment of his own providing, or, on the other hand, a poor man, who attempted to wear his ragged garments, it would in either case have been an insult to the king, a despising both of the "robe" provided and of the thing invited to.<a name=271:3></a> He who invites to the wedding is the only one who can provide the guests with a garment suited to the occasion.<a name=271:4></a> All is entirely set aside, both as to the thought of our capacity (because of anything we are in ourselves), to come in, and as to the fear of our state shutting us out.<a name=271:5></a> Our blessing depends on one single thing, the sufficiency and the grace of him who invites.<a name=271:6></a>

		"Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the marriage.<a name=271:7></a> But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise: and the remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and slew them.<a name=271:8></a> But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city," verse 4-7.<a name=271:9></a> Here again we get a notice of the manner of God's patience, and also an evidence of what the heart of man is.<a name=271:10></a> Just as the Lord had taken them up (the Jews) before on the ground of God's claim to fruit through the ministry of the prophets, and by His Son, so now He takes them up on this other ground of the invitation to the "marriage supper," "and they made light of it.<a name=271:11></a>"

		"All things are ready" (that is, there is nothing more to be done); this was specially the message when the apostles went out after the crucifixion.<a name=271:12></a> The feast was ready.<a name=271:13></a> The principle of man's heart is seen, not only in despising the claim, but in slighting the grace of God, and in killing His witnesses.<a name=271:14></a> The carelessness that would make a sinner despise the king's grace is exactly the same thing in principle that would make

		But then we have this blessed truth: God did not give up one particle of the fulness of His love, or of the blessedness of His purpose as regards His Son.<a name=272:3></a> He is dealing upon this ground, I must have people around me, and blessed there; I must have the "marriage" of my Son honourable.<a name=272:4></a> Yes; God, so to speak, must have His house filled.<a name=272:5></a> "Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy.<a name=272:6></a> Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage.<a name=272:7></a> So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all, as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests," verse 8-10.<a name=272:8></a> Now there is the present going forth of the gospel into the world -- the great character of the gospel.<a name=272:9></a>

		Those who are familiar with the study of this part of scripture will remember that the history of Israel from the Red Sea to Sinai (that is, from the time of their deliverance out of Egypt until they placed themselves under law) contains an exceedingly remarkable testimony to the grace of God.<a name=276:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		At Sinai Israel took up the promises of God on the condition of their own obedience, and then their entire failure was manifested.<a name=276:2></a> But up to that moment all God's dealings with them had been in grace.<a name=276:3></a> Though there was continual murmuring and unbelief and disobedience, He did not chasten for these things as afterwards, when they had taken a stand before Him on the ground of obedience.<a name=276:4></a> It was an immense transition in their history.<a name=276:5></a>

		So long as Israel were living in Egypt, there was nothing at all that drew out the thoughts and feelings of Balak and Balaam against them, or that made them intolerable to the world; but the chief point of the testimony to their blessing is that they were a peculiar people, separated from all other people unto God, according to that word, "Jehovah hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people," Deuteronomy 26: 18.<a name=300:11></a>

		THE ACCEPTED MAN
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2 Corinthians 3
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two ways in which we may approach the judgment of man.<a name=328:1></a> We may judge of where man is (of the condition in which he is looked at by God) by taking the word of God and applying it to the condition of man in himself, to his state as an actual sinner.<a name=328:2></a> Thus, for instance, in Genesis 3, in the sin of Adam and Eve in the garden we see the character of evil against God Himself; in Genesis 4, in Cain's sin, the character of evil against man's neighbour.<a name=328:3></a> Here then is direct opposition to the requirement of God in both its parts; Luke 10: 27.<a name=328:4></a> But there is another thing of which Scripture is full -- <i>the accepted man</i>, the Lord Jesus.<a name=328:5></a> We get in Him a precious living divine picture of what that Man is whom God does accept -- of the Man after God's own heart.<a name=328:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we find in Christ the accepted Man, whatever any other man's thoughts may be about himself, it is evident he is not this, because he is not like Christ (I speak not now as to divine power).<a name=328:7></a> In the glory Christ is the accepted and the acceptable Man before God.<a name=328:8></a> As the pattern for the saint He is the exhibitor, not of divine power in grace toward man, but of manhood such as God can accept.<a name=328:9></a> Now no man can at any rate lay claim to being this.<a name=328:10></a> The unconverted man, though he cannot comprehend the Man after God's own heart, can plainly see he is not this.<a name=328:11></a> A blind man may not be able to tell what I mean when I speak to him about light and colour, because he has no perception of these things, he is blind; but he knows that the things I am talking about he lacks the knowledge of.<a name=328:12></a> So, when Christ is spoken of, the natural man is in a state of forgetfulness, or rather of ignorance as to who and what Christ is (whether looked at in relation to God or to the sinner), and therefore as to the real dissimilarity between himself and Christ; but he is perfectly aware that there are things which others know about Christ that he does not know.<a name=328:13></a> He may say he knows them, but he does not; and moreover he must be conscious that he does not know that which he professes to know.<a name=328:14></a> The blind man may hear me speak, or be listening to sweet music, and in a certain sense lose nothing through his blindness (in the present enjoyment of what he hears he may forget his inability to see); but let him attempt

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So with the sinner.<a name=329:3></a> When the natural man hears the word of God read, or when Christ is spoken of, he is blind, ignorant (as was said before) of who and what Christ is; but he is ignorant of the depth of his ignorance; his mind is so occupied with other things that he does not think about it, and he gets used to his ignorance.<a name=329:4></a> When the truth is put before him he cannot see it; yet he must know that he knows nothing about it.<a name=329:5></a> If he looks into the Scriptures, he does not apprehend Him of whom they speak.<a name=329:6></a> He is entirely ignorant of the motives that actuated Christ in His path through this world; yet, if his attention be at all called to what Christ was, he must have the consciousness that he is not like Him, that he is not and has not the thing spoken of.<a name=329:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If it be true that this is the acceptable Man, the Man in whom God delights -- acceptable in His spirit, and ways, and character, it must be evident to the natural man that he cannot be.<a name=329:8></a> He may have many amiable qualities (in nature there is much that is engaging and beautiful: we see it even in the animals) but nothing that is acceptable to God.<a name=329:9></a> Morally we do not find one single motive that governed Christ governing man, as man; it is evident, therefore, that if Christ's were acceptable motives, his are not.<a name=329:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now being accepted is a great thing.<a name=329:11></a> It is impossible to think of a day of blessing, or of a day of judgment, without immediately having thoughts arise in the soul as to how it will be with us, whether we shall stand accepted in that day, whether we shall escape that judgment.<a name=329:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A man of the world must own that he has nothing in common with Christ, except indeed that he is a man and Christ was a man: he eats, drinks, sleeps; and Christ ate, drank, slept.<a name=329:13></a> But there is sin in every man, and Christ was "without sin" -- sin in the place of godliness, malice in the place of love.<a name=329:14></a> As regards the moral motives of the soul, he has not any of Christ's, and Christ had not one of his.<a name=329:15></a> The world would cease if its conduct were regulated by the motives which actuated Christ; it could not go on an hour.<a name=329:16></a> There may be the outward imitation of that which was found in Christ; but God is not mocked.<a name=329:17></a> But, it may be said, and many do say it, God does not expect

		us to be like Christ in everything.<a name=330:1></a> Now the fact is, God does expect us to be like Christ.<a name=330:2></a> It is impossible for God to accept one thing as that which is agreeable to Himself, and then accept or be satisfied with the directly opposite.<a name=330:3></a> If the man of the world is the very opposite of what Christ was, God cannot accept him.<a name=330:4></a> He cannot deny Himself.<a name=330:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We shall see how God does bring into the very same place as Christ those who are accepted in Him.<a name=330:6></a> You cannot have a third man.<a name=330:7></a> You must have either the place of the first man, rejected, turned out into the world, in the place of ruin; or that of the second Man, accepted, brought out of the world to God.<a name=330:8></a> There is no third man offering an indefinite acceptance in some unknown condition.<a name=330:9></a>

		What then is the Christian?<a name=330:10></a> We read here of two things as characterising him: he is an "epistle of Christ"; he has "liberty.<a name=330:11></a>" What is the "liberty"?<a name=330:12></a> You will find this a characteristic of man, as man, that he has not liberty with God, and (though he has not liberty from Satan) he has liberty with Satan.<a name=330:13></a> He is afraid of God; but he is not afraid of Satan.<a name=330:14></a> He would not like to be with Satan in hell, it is true; he is horrified at the thought of that; but he is not horrified at walking with him every day.<a name=330:15></a> He is at liberty with Satan, walking at his ease with him in the earth; but of walking with God he has a perfect terror.<a name=330:16></a> Now do you, dear friends, find yourselves at liberty with God?<a name=330:17></a> I know that in heaven by-and-by you would like to be with God; but do you covet this nearness now?<a name=330:18></a> That is the question.<a name=330:19></a> Do you feel at home with God?<a name=330:20></a> would you like Him to take you just such as you are?<a name=330:21></a> Taking you just such as you are, could you trust yourselves with God?<a name=330:22></a> You hope, perhaps, that when the day of judgment comes, all will be well with you; you have no thought but that you will be able to stand in the judgment then.<a name=330:23></a> But if God were about to take you just such as you are at this moment is there not something you would be afraid of?<a name=330:24></a> What is there so terrible in thinking about God, that you should be afraid of God, that you would not like to trust God with your present condition?<a name=330:25></a> You are not afraid to trust Satan.<a name=330:26></a>

		Man can compare himself with the reprobate sinner, and take credit in his own eyes for the difference between himself and the sinner, when God is not in the conscience; but he puts away the judgment of God concerning himself, he never compares himself with Christ, "neither cometh he to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved," John 3: 20, 21.<a name=331:13></a> Now let us look at Christ, as to this judgment of man about himself.<a name=331:14></a> We find Christ scorning what man delights in, passing by those who could thus compare themselves amongst themselves, and becoming the friend of the profligate and the abandoned.<a name=331:15></a>

		When He met with a publican, or a person of bad character, making no pretence to be anything but a sinner, He was at home with the sinner.<a name=331:16></a> Of such were His companions.<a name=331:17></a> He came in grace to sinners, as sinners.<a name=331:18></a> He saw into the heart, and therefore detected the hollowness of all man's pretended righteousness.<a name=331:19></a> He did not come from heaven to this earth to look for righteousness -- that is the last thing He would have taken the journey for; He came to seek sinners.<a name=331:20></a>

		Again, you read a person's character in his letter.<a name=331:21></a> Now the Christian is Christ's letter to the world.<a name=331:22></a> In verse 3 the apostle speaks of him as "the epistle of Christ," written by the Spirit of the living God in the fleshy tables of the heart, and contrasts him with the law written on tables of stone.<a name=331:23></a> A Christian is therefore a person upon whose heart the Spirit of God has engraved Christ, just as truly as God wrote and engraved the law upon the tables of stone; so that the world may read Christ in the man, as an Israelite might read the law on the stones Now how far can we according to this definition call

		There is another terrible thing: we find men agreeing to take the commandments of God as their rule and guide, as Christ took them.<a name=334:2></a> We take His directions, they say, all that God says about what we ought to be, and what we ought to do; we are not going our own way.<a name=334:3></a> Well, granted; but you must take the law, such as it is, and with its consequences.<a name=334:4></a> If man says, I accept the law to be judged by, I take this as my guide, he makes himself the responsible party, that is, he has to answer for himself.<a name=334:5></a> And mark how God began with the law.<a name=334:6></a> What does the law say about him?<a name=334:7></a> It says he is "cursed" already.<a name=334:8></a> This law that he is taking to get to heaven by is the very thing that pronounces judgment against him: "Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them," Gal 3: 10.<a name=334:9></a> Suppose I bring a right and true measure to a man who is in the habit of using a wrong measure, what do I do it for?<a name=334:10></a> Not to make him honest, but to prove his dishonesty.<a name=334:11></a> It is in vain for him to say, I will change my character; the thing is already done.<a name=334:12></a> The question is, has he a character?<a name=334:13></a> and he is proved to be a dishonest man.<a name=334:14></a> Now the law was given "that the offence might abound," Romans 5: 20.<a name=334:15></a> The right, perfect, holy law of God was given as a rule; but if that rule be given to a sinner who cannot keep it, and if it be applied with all the searching power of the holiness of God, he is a judged person, and brought in under its curse.<a name=334:16></a> He hopes perhaps to be better; he has some vague thoughts about the mercy of God; but it is no use to talk about what he will be: judgment is already pronounced against him.<a name=334:17></a>

		But more than this, as a matter of fact the law tells man not so much what he is to do, as what he is not to do.<a name=334:18></a> If we look at the ten commandments we shall find that they do not tell him to do anything, except to honour his father and his mother.<a name=334:19></a> That is the only positive precept.<a name=334:20></a> All the rest are, "Thou .<a name=334:21></a>.<a name=334:22></a> shalt not" do this, and thou shalt not do that.<a name=334:23></a> How comes it then that such a form is employed?<a name=334:24></a> This of itself is a sufficient proof of evil tendencies in those addressed.<a name=334:25></a> Men care not to make laws for a country to prohibit that which nobody thinks of doing; and so God's law forbids people to do certain things because they have a tendency to do those very things; it touches the motives and dispositions of men's hearts as they are known by God.<a name=334:26></a>

		But this is not all.<a name=342:6></a> Even though a great deal of grace accompanied the law, so long as the law was such as it was, it was necessarily obscure in its revelation of God; the blending of the two, the exhibition of the goodness of God with the presence of the claims of the law (that is, with the question of what man was), could only lead to misery, wretchedness, and darkness of soul.<a name=342:7></a> So long as the question remained, 'What are you for God?<a name=342:8></a> are you what you ought to be?<a name=342:9></a>' so long as it was not a revelation of unmingled grace -- of that which did not, and would not, and could not, mingle itself with anything else, it could only condemn.<a name=342:10></a> The revelation of God's demands on man must condemn.<a name=342:11></a> No matter how much grace mingles itself with it -- nay, the more the kindness and goodness of God -- the greater the obligation of man to answer to it, and the greater the sense of the sin of man in not meeting the character of God thus revealed.<a name=342:12></a> If it is it not all grace, you must be condemned; if it is anything but pure simple grace, you must take up the question of what man is, that God is dealing with; and then it is all over with you, for God cannot depart from what He ought to be, as holy.<a name=342:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The law set up again, Moses comes down from the mount with his face shining (himself unconscious of all this shining), and the people, when they see it, afraid to come nigh, are obliged to ask him to put a veil over his face.<a name=344:12></a> The sight of the glory brought a sense of condemnation, and they prayed that it might be taken from them.<a name=344:13></a> This it is that the apostle refers to (verse 7, 13).<a name=344:14></a>

		Not only, as it regards the law, is there conviction of sin through it, and thus not any possibility of relationship between man and God on the ground of it, where it is simply law but there is an impossibility of man's being in connection with God as the source of happiness, save on the ground of pure grace that sets aside altogether what the sinner is.<a name=345:13></a> There is often more difficulty in seeing this.<a name=345:14></a> Unless it be pure simple grace, the only other idea we can have is that God requires something; and if God requires anything, the more the grace and the goodness shown, the more guilty and failing are we, and the greater our condemnation; it only increases responsibility.<a name=345:15></a> If it is a mixture of law with goodness, man cannot bear to look at it.<a name=345:16></a>

		It is rather a solemn thing to say what a Christian is, especially when we think of what it is that made him one.<a name=360:1></a> God is acting so as to glorify Himself.<a name=360:2></a> It is a solemn thing to be a revelation of that of which Christ is worthy -- of the result of Christ's work; as it is said, "He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied," Isaiah 53: 11.<a name=360:3></a> It does us good to think of this, because it makes us judge ourselves, to see how far we are really that.<a name=360:4></a> Not that we ever shall be the perfect display of it until we are "like him" (1 John 3: 2), until we see Him as He is, and are conformed unto His image in glory.<a name=360:5></a> Still, if we bear Christ's name, we should seek to present a fitting result of His work in the world.<a name=360:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is what a Christian is.<a name=360:7></a> Hence it becomes a solemn thing to say what he is.<a name=360:8></a> Still, whilst it is a solemn question, it is a matter of grace.<a name=360:9></a> There is such a comfort in this thought!<a name=360:10></a> Whilst most solemn, it is always happy, because it is of grace -- the free, full, and sovereign grace of God.<a name=360:11></a> This all helps us a little.<a name=360:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		With regard to the question itself, there is a great difference between what a Christian is "now," and what he will be "hereafter.<a name=360:13></a>" Not as regards the spring of life, redemption, etc.<a name=360:14></a>, but now a Christian is the expression of the power of God in the midst of evil; hereafter he will be the expression of the result of that power which has put away the evil, when all the evil is put away.<a name=360:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Take us at our best estate now -- a Christian is the expression of the power of God in the midst of the prevalence of evil.<a name=360:16></a> A Christian will not be that exactly hereafter; he will then be the expression of the result of God's power, in the highest sense, when the evil is put away.<a name=360:17></a> As to the foundation in Christ's blood, and the power of His resurrection, and the love of God, this as much belongs to his state hereafter as it is the basis of what he is now.<a name=360:18></a> God's love in Christ will be the spring of my joy then as it is now.<a name=360:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One thing that gives such settledness of peace (as it regards his own soul's peace) to the Christian is, that it does not depend upon what he is now, or will be then, but upon that which is common to both states.<a name=360:20></a> The ground of it is the same now

	<div class="paragraph">
		that it will be in heaven.<a name=361:1></a> The thing displayed may differ; but the ground of confidence is the same now as hereafter.<a name=361:2></a> As to the source and spring of it in the love of God, His love is as true, and as perfect, and as complete, and as much manifested towards me now, as it will be when I am in glory; He cannot in His divine love go beyond the gift of His Son.<a name=361:3></a> The life also that I have now is not a different life from that I shall have then.<a name=361:4></a> No doubt the body hinders it.<a name=361:5></a> Its manifestation will be different; but the life is the same.<a name=361:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And the ground of peace changes not.<a name=361:7></a> That upon which I rest for eternity is just as much now as it will be then.<a name=361:8></a> The blood of Christ has been shed and has been carried into the holiest; Hebrews 9, 10.<a name=361:9></a> Whatever our conflicts, our conflicts (properly speaking) spring from that ground being entirely settled.<a name=361:10></a> Whoever is in conflict as to that has not got to God, or otherwise has not understood the ground of his standing.<a name=361:11></a> Unsettlement of soul may arise from a man's not having seen the gospel simply; but as to the ground of his standing, it is just as much accepted now as it will be then.<a name=361:12></a> There is not another Christ to die -- no fresh blood to be shed.<a name=361:13></a> Nor is there another revelation to be made.<a name=361:14></a> There is not a love to spring up in the heart of God that has not been told out.<a name=361:15></a> There may be a fuller apprehension of that which has been accomplished, but there is nothing new either to be accomplished or revealed.<a name=361:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Whoever has not got upon that ground (has not had that question settled in his soul) has not got as yet upon simple Christian ground.<a name=361:17></a> God may be working in his soul; but I do not call having life the getting upon simple Christian ground.<a name=361:18></a> There may be life without the knowledge of what God is as for us, of the perfectness of His love towards us, and of what He has done for us in Christ.<a name=361:19></a> Life may make me anxious, and hope, and have desires after God, and long to be assured of His favour, and the like; but, when we speak of a "Christian," we speak of what a Christian is in Scripture, and Scripture always speaks of him -- of a believer in any state -- as to his standing.<a name=361:20></a> It is very necessary to see this.<a name=361:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We must not confound the exercises of a Christian with the standing of a Christian.<a name=361:22></a> The ground of his standing is God's work.<a name=361:23></a> In his exercises there comes in himself; his flesh, his ignorance, and many other things alas!<a name=361:24></a> may be working.<a name=361:25></a> But it is entirely according to God's thoughts, and
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=362>[Page 362]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		not according to my thoughts, that my standing is to be judged of.<a name=362:1></a> Moreover the exercises of my own soul are never the same as God's judgment about them.<a name=362:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When I am thinking of these, it is my actual state that occupies me; but were God to take notice of my actual state, He must condemn me.<a name=362:3></a> What He has regard to is the work of Christ for me, and my union with Him, not in this respect my actual state at all.<a name=362:4></a> It is always important to recollect that, because my own judgment of myself ought to be as to my actual state.<a name=362:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Whatever his exercises, however these may vary, the Christian, in one sense, is just the same, because he is in God's sight as Christ.<a name=362:6></a> Christ being the perfectly accepted man at God's right hand, the Christian is looked at by God in the same position (Ephesians 2: 6), sitting in heavenly places "in Christ.<a name=362:7></a>" In that sense there cannot be any difference; and the ground of our acceptance cannot ever be imperfect.<a name=362:8></a> I repeat, we must not confound the movements of life with the ground of our acceptance.<a name=362:9></a> We can never have this too simple and clear.<a name=362:10></a> It does not make one despise the first actings of life, its first movings and breathings, however feeble and imperfect: I do not despise my child because he is not a man.<a name=362:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the Ephesians (where what a Christian is is fully brought out), men are viewed as the "children of wrath" in their very nature (necessarily heirs of wrath, because God is what He is, and man is what he is.<a name=362:12></a>) Every other distinction is lost sight of, because, in his character of a sinner, man is brought fully into the light of God.<a name=362:13></a> But having thus told us what man is, the apostle does not stop with man; he turns round and begins at the other end; he now tells us what God is, that He is "rich in mercy," and (as the effect of this) that He has set us in heavenly places in Christ.<a name=362:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But when we come a little more to detail, I would recall the distinction which I made at first -- that a Christian is now the expression of the power of divine life and the divine presence (divine life, I mean, aided by the power of God), in the midst of evil that he knows; but hereafter he will be the blessed expression of the result of God's power when evil is put away.<a name=362:15></a> So with Christ (there was no evil of course in Him; yet, speaking abstractly, it was the same thing; in Him it was perfect) when here; He was what He was in the midst of evil.<a name=362:16></a> There cannot be any increase in it in itself; but the

	<div class="paragraph">
		manifestation of divine power in us is capable of an indefinite increase.<a name=363:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Redemption, however, precedes everything else (I do not mean by this that it precedes the counsels of God).<a name=363:2></a> First, Christ "loved the church, and gave himself for it; that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, that he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that is should be holy and without blemish," Ephesians 5: 25-27.<a name=363:3></a> Redemption precedes the washing.<a name=363:4></a> Washing may go on, but it comes after redemption.<a name=363:5></a> He makes her His, before He sets about making her what He would have her to be.<a name=363:6></a> There may not be a clear thought as to it; but the thing is done nevertheless.<a name=363:7></a> Redemption being accomplished, the Lord sets about producing in us the effects and fruits of His grace in conformity to Himself.<a name=363:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first effect of divine life in the midst of evil is not merely to see, but to have the conscience exercised about, certain things.<a name=363:9></a> The moment life begins to work, we get the consciousness of evil inside, as well as of evil outside; that is, it gives the judgment of evil in ourselves.<a name=363:10></a> Not that the instant Christ is presented to the soul in grace, the soul sees the evil plainly; it may see the grace and blessing, knowing evil in a general way, without being exercised about it through any definite application of what Christ is to the man within; there may be rather the loveliness of Christ attracting than any deep work in the conscience.<a name=363:11></a> I can quite understand that.<a name=363:12></a> But then, before we get into a properly Christian state (the process may be longer or shorter), the necessary effect of life working is to give us the judgment of what man is, in the main bearing of his present condition, as looked at by the Holy Ghost.<a name=363:13></a> It brings in the consciousness of what we are in the presence of what Christ is.<a name=363:14></a> Then we get the man brought down into the distinct consciousness that it is all over with him.<a name=363:15></a> And it is all over with him.<a name=363:16></a> I mean by this, not merely that he has sinned and there is condemnation, but that he has no right or title or claim to anything now that he has, either to the promises of God or to anything else.<a name=363:17></a> Now that is the place the soul has to be brought to (so hard to come to), to find out what it is in God's presence.<a name=363:18></a> He may hope to get out of the scrape if he thinks he has any right to the promises, because these may help him; but it is no use talking of God's

		promises when God is talking of what I am and of judgment.<a name=364:1></a> If I am thinking about what I may be some time or other, promises have their place, they come in most beautifully; but if it is what I am, promises do not touch that.<a name=364:2></a> The Syrophenician woman (Matthew 15) will serve as an illustration.<a name=364:3></a> No promise could meet her condition; for as a Gentile she had not any claim to the promises.<a name=364:4></a> The Lord says, "I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.<a name=364:5></a>" If you come to me as an Israelite, I may do something for you; otherwise "it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it unto dogs.<a name=364:6></a>" But when she replies, "Truth, Lord, yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters table," she in effect says, God is rich in mercy; and Christ cannot say He is not -- that there is nothing in God for a poor sinner.<a name=364:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not believe that a person gets upon right Christian ground (one has to make allowance for ignorance, but there is no true, no solid ground, as to simple and abiding peace), until the soul has been brought to the consciousness that it has no claim whatever or title to promise.<a name=364:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having been brought down to this by what goes on within, there may be attraction; but the first full effect is that the man is judged, he sees what he is, and becomes entirely hopeless as to what he is, and is turned over entirely to the thought of what God is.<a name=364:9></a> We have only to say, "What hath God wrought!<a name=364:10></a>" I am now upon new ground, namely, upon that of what God is towards a sinner who is altogether vile.<a name=364:11></a> If the sinner is perfectly vile, God is perfectly good.<a name=364:12></a> Further, I come to see what He has done because He is so.<a name=364:13></a> It is not that He has taken him out of the world.<a name=364:14></a> "I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world," etc.<a name=364:15></a> He will do that by-and-by.<a name=364:16></a>

		The first thing in this new life, inasmuch as it is all in Christ, is, that He is raised from the dead.<a name=364:17></a> We have to look at what God has done in Christ.<a name=364:18></a> I find Christ dead because of sins (our sins); and then I find the quickening life-giving power of God coming in and raising Him from the dead.<a name=364:19></a> I should separate this entirely from the heavenly standing of the saints.<a name=364:20></a> We have all been too much accustomed to confound these two things, resurrection-life, and heavenly standing.<a name=364:21></a> What I see as the effect of resurrection-life is this: -- a man quickened and raised with Christ becomes a pilgrim down here.<a name=364:22></a> This is not the whole of a Christian.<a name=364:23></a> But it is the power of divine

		In 1 Peter 1 we read, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath [not, "blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ," as in the Ephesians; but] begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead; to an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you, who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time," verse 3-5.<a name=365:4></a> I find here persons begotten unto a lively hope, and what is their hope?<a name=365:5></a> are they sitting in heaven?<a name=365:6></a> No, they are hoping for it.<a name=365:7></a> Therefore the apostle says (chapter 2: 11), "Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul.<a name=365:8></a>" It is the Christian on his pilgrimage that is contemplated.<a name=365:9></a> He is a stranger here.<a name=365:10></a> He has an inheritance in heaven; when he is in his inheritance, he will be no stranger; but he is not there, he is going towards heaven.<a name=365:11></a> He is a resurrection-man on earth, walking through the world with new affections and feelings, going on towards his inheritance, but he is not there; an Israelite in the wilderness, redeemed from Egypt, and a stranger, but not in Canaan.<a name=365:12></a> And there comes in the trial of faith.<a name=365:13></a> The apostle goes on to say, "Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations: that the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ.<a name=365:14></a>"

		Both these things are true of the same person -- both are true of the Christian.<a name=366:3></a> It is good to have the trial of faith, it supposes faith to be there; it is good to sit down with Christ where no trial is, and it is good to come down into trial.<a name=366:4></a> But these are different conditions.<a name=366:5></a> The place of Christ on the mount, when with Moses and Elias (Luke 9), was different in the midst of the excellent glory from that in which He stood when He came down from the mount, and had to meet the crowd, and then cast out the devil.<a name=366:6></a> My true position as a heavenly man is to sit in heavenly places in Christ; but on the other hand, as begotten to a new hope by the resurrection of Christ, it is simply going through the world, but it is through the world that I am going.<a name=366:7></a> Here I am, a new creature, quickened and raised up with Christ; and what a world am I in!<a name=366:8></a> So with regard to Christ's coming; if walking on earth, I am waiting for Christ, the hope of the coming of Christ, and His appearing to set things right here; but if sitting in heaven, I am there in Christ, and wait to be there with Christ actually, and there enjoy Christ fully.<a name=366:9></a> The Lord's coming is not spoken of in the Ephesians; the saints are viewed as sitting in heaven.<a name=366:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I get these two elements of a Christian's position; and in one sense I do not call one more important than the other.<a name=366:11></a> I may look at the Christian at the springhead of peace, in full enjoyment of heavenly places, and in settled peace with God, and fighting for Him in conflict with Satan.<a name=366:12></a> But I cannot have him fighting for God in Canaan till I get him into Canaan; I may have him in Egypt under the enemy's power, but that is not conflict with him.<a name=366:13></a> It needs redemption by God.<a name=366:14></a> But this places him in the wilderness, a second element of his Christian life.<a name=366:15></a>

		But there is another truth stated here -- they are also "without strength.<a name=386:11></a>" When a man is really brought to himself, it is always a question of present standing.<a name=386:12></a> An ungodly man will think (it is the natural thought) of meeting God some time, of what He will be in the day of judgment.<a name=386:13></a> But if His presence be revealed to the heart, it is His presence now that occupies it.<a name=386:14></a> Whilst there is merely the thought of going to God, there is another question: man thinks about how he can make up with God -- time is before him, in which he can make his peace with God.<a name=386:15></a> He is either unconscious of the state he is in, or is looking to something by which he hopes, at a future day, he may be able to stand before God.<a name=386:16></a> He has no real thought of God but as a judge.<a name=386:17></a> Now hoping for mercy so, is no more than saying (and many mean nothing but this), that God is not of purer eyes than to behold iniquity, that He can let a little pass.<a name=386:18></a>

		As to the first point, the state of the Gentiles was thorough ungodliness; Romans 1.<a name=386:19></a> The apostle, after looking at man in every way (proud as man is of himself), brings all in guilty.<a name=386:20></a> But men have a natural conscience, and they are afraid to do in the light what they do in the dark.<a name=386:21></a> When in the outward darkness of Satan and ungodliness, they "work all manner of uncleanness with greediness" (Ephesians 4: 17-19), worshipping stocks and stones, etc.<a name=386:22></a> Christianity makes men ashamed to

		But besides this, there was another thing.<a name=387:5></a> God singled out a nation, to which He shewed great kindness, and gave (as His people) a rule.<a name=387:6></a> And then the question was whether there was strength in man to walk by this rule.<a name=387:7></a> He spake the ten commandments with His own voice on mount Sinai, and added, "Cursed is the man that continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the law to do them.<a name=387:8></a>" After all the will of man was that which wrought in his heart, and he was a breaker of this law.<a name=387:9></a>

		But this went much farther.<a name=387:10></a> I may have my mind open to see and estimate the spirituality of the law, and not be merely a carnal Jew: where does that bring me?<a name=387:11></a> Into the consciousness, not merely that I have failed, and broken the law without, but of a principle within -- a "law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members," Romans 7: 23.<a name=387:12></a> If I am put under a law, the better that law, the worse my case.<a name=387:13></a> It may be said, "Why then did God give the law?<a name=387:14></a>" "It was added," we are told, "because of transgressions, till the Seed should come to whom the promise was made," Galatians 3: 19.<a name=387:15></a> To what end?<a name=387:16></a> "The law entered [perfect as it was] that the offence might abound.<a name=387:17></a>" What could the law enter for, to man already a sinner and having this law in his members?<a name=387:18></a> "The law entered that the offence might abound, that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful," Romans 7: 13.<a name=387:19></a> This was the way God took to convince man that he was "without strength.<a name=387:20></a>" And in that sense it was mercy.<a name=387:21></a> What is more difficult than to convince man of this?<a name=387:22></a> The judgment right and the affections right, still there was this law in his members; and the law, while it discovered and brought out this, imparting no strength, added to the character of the sin.<a name=387:23></a> For then was another thing; it made every act which was the result of this evil of our nature "transgression" -- a thing done in despite of His authority.<a name=387:24></a> "Sin by the commandment became exceeding sinful," Romans 7: 13.<a name=387:25></a> Now clearly a

		A word here as to the triple form the law took.<a name=388:11></a> First, there was the perfect standard of what man ought to be; secondly, the prohibition of what man was disposed to, a positive standard of what God required, and the prohibition of that to which man was inclined; and, as a third thing, an adjunct of certain ordinances and ceremonies "imposed until the time of reformation," Hebrews 9: 9, 10.<a name=388:12></a> What did God do all this for?<a name=388:13></a> On the one hand, to demonstrate that man was not righteous; and, on the other, to point out One who (holy and righteous) should suffer "the just for the unjust.<a name=388:14></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		What did man?<a name=388:15></a> He took, to make out a righteousness for himself before God, the thing God had sent in to demonstrate him a sinner; and then, in order to fill up the gap in his own heart, sought to eke out his righteousness through these ceremonies -- types and prefigurings of Jesus, the substitute for the sinner.<a name=388:16></a>

		The moment there is spiritual understanding, when grace is not understood, the only effect is to make the soul miserable -- it finds no strength.<a name=388:17></a> The more it understands the law to be what it should be, the more it feels justly condemned, and incapable of fulfilling it, or of delivering itself from its condition.<a name=388:18></a> "O wretched man that I am!<a name=388:19></a>" is its cry, and "Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?<a name=388:20></a>" (Romans 7: 24).<a name=388:21></a> All that is merely the question, "What is man?<a name=388:22></a>" Man is ungodly and without strength; and his history is summed up in the death of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=388:23></a>

		There is another point.<a name=391:16></a> It is not merely the efficacy of the work as regards the past, so that I stand before God without fault, but I am there in Christ.<a name=391:17></a> I bless God for many means in helping me on in my walk; but as for my standing with God, were there anything whatever needed, it would be saying, I was not already perfect in Christ.<a name=391:18></a> Faith says, Christ has presented me in the presence of God, according to the mind of God, and I have nothing to seek.<a name=391:19></a> This is what the apostle means by "holding the Head," Colossians 2: 19.<a name=391:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thing flows from this: as grace reigns through righteousness unto eternal life in the Person and work of our Lord Jesus Christ, realising my position by virtue of being united to Him, the life in which I am one with Christ will shew itself down here in my living to Christ.<a name=391:21></a> The principle of the Christian's position is just this: -- You have died with Christ, and, to be living as those who are "alive from the dead," you cannot have a single principle in common with the world.<a name=391:22></a> I am one with Christ (if I am a believer), and consequently as Christ before God, "I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me," Galatians 2: 20.<a name=391:23></a>
