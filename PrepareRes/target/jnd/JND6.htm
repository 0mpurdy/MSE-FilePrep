		TO FRANCIS WILLIAM NEWMAN
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will not be at a loss to discover the author of this attempt at a reply to your last publication, so strangely entitled "Phases of Faith;" nor to recognize one once well known to yourself.<a name=1:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have had no thought of sparing your book.<a name=1:5></a> You have denied and dishonoured in it the Lord that bought me, to whom I owe everything a soul can know in blessing and God reveal in grace.<a name=1:6></a> I have no sympathy with cold indifference in such a case.<a name=1:7></a> It is a duty to feel.<a name=1:8></a> Not to feel proves we have never felt what it seeks to pull down.<a name=1:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With yourself the case is somewhat different.<a name=1:10></a> Not that I can distinguish, as some do, between a book and its author.<a name=1:11></a> If the book is a guilty one, its author is guilty of it.<a name=1:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is another feeling arises as to the author, which does not as to the book.<a name=1:13></a> To the book I can measure out, without a pang, unmingled feelings of disgust and contempt; to the author I could not.<a name=1:14></a> The thought of him awakens sorrow, regret, pain, a thousand feelings which the evil I find in his work, the thoughts as to Christ once expressed by him and supposed genuine by me, and my own love to souls, however feeble, as alas!<a name=1:15></a> it is, contribute to produce.<a name=1:16></a> I do mourn; and hence it is I add these few prefatory words.<a name=1:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have known you, supposed you loved Christ, took for granted (as one unsuspectingly does) you believed in Him, heard a testimony from yourself to your spiritual delight in Him, as the joy, the food, and delight of your soul.<a name=1:18></a> Was all a delusion?<a name=1:19></a> Is not your present book?<a name=1:20></a> Did you feel these things?<a name=1:21></a> Were they, as you thought, livingly linked up with a Christ known to yourself?<a name=1:22></a> Does your book prove a greater moral elevation?<a name=1:23></a> Forgive me, if I think that, independent of all dogma, it proves frightful descent from what at least restrained your steps, your lips, then, if it did not possess your heart.<a name=1:24></a> Can you compare what then expressed your joys with the feelings and manner of thinking (I am not talking of views or groundwork of judgment, but of their effects) which your book betrays, and feel happy at it?<a name=1:25></a> Take some of your own letters, and say.<a name=1:26></a> I have some which, of course, I cannot quote here for these expressions of your feelings.<a name=1:27></a> But what a difference when I read them!<a name=1:28></a> I cannot bring myself to believe that there was nothing real in them.<a name=1:29></a> My soul looks out for some gleam of such thoughts in the book your infidelity has produced; but I can only find a miserable nature let loose by it.<a name=1:30></a> Who can tell how deep something else may be buried by such a mass of nature's ruins and filth, which the mighty grace of God may yet disencumber and make grow, and thus the old serpent lose its natural and congenial haunt?<a name=1:31></a>

		But I write that you may at least feel that my attacking your book is as far as possible from bitterness toward you.<a name=2:1></a> I have no desire to spare your book.<a name=2:2></a> I am dealing with a book -- with principles and with minds that may be affected by it.<a name=2:3></a> I believe it a dishonour to yourself; but as regards your book, you are but a name attached to the moral condition of mind contained in it, and there presented to the public.<a name=2:4></a> I am not dealing with you about it, but with it before God and my reader.<a name=2:5></a> The thought of yourself, which intruded itself necessarily upon me in reading it, was one of deep sorrow -- I trust of gracious feeling.<a name=2:6></a> My answer to the book was not the place to express it: I can here assure you of it.<a name=2:7></a> If you read my book, you must expect no concealment of a severe (I believe a just) judgment of your publication.<a name=2:8></a>

		You have here the unfeigned expression of what I feel as regards yourself -- not in its strength, as this must be public (and I hate published feeling), but at least the true character of it -- pain -- sorrow -- I trust divine love -- and a lingering clinging to the hope that, however low he may have fallen, it is impossible that one who has expressed the feelings you have in bygone times could have done so without some reality.<a name=2:9></a>

		PREFACE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have no pretension to learning or leisure, yet I have written and now present to my reader a book, the size of which, when I see it complete, alarms myself.<a name=3:1></a> It may be asked why I undertook such a task when I knew that I had neither.<a name=3:2></a> My answer is this: When any one loves, confides in, and is deeply indebted to another (and in this case the debt is infinite), he will seek to defend, if he has any heart, the beloved object when it is attacked, without perhaps exactly measuring his power to be fully successful in its defence.<a name=3:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One qualification (none is of any value if God be not with us) I may boast of -- profound, unfeigned (I believe divinely given) faith in the Bible.<a name=3:4></a> I have, through grace, been by it converted, enlightened, quickened, saved.<a name=3:5></a> I have received the knowledge of God by it to adore His perfections -- of Jesus, the Saviour, joy, strength, comfort of my soul.<a name=3:6></a> Many have been indebted to others as the means of their being brought to God, to ministers of that gospel which the Bible contains, or to friends who delight in it.<a name=3:7></a> This was not my case.<a name=3:8></a> That work, which is ever God's, was wrought in me through the means of the written word.<a name=3:9></a> He who knows what the value of Jesus is will know what the Bible will be to such a one.<a name=3:10></a> If I have, alas!<a name=3:11></a> failed it, in nearly thirty years' arduous and varied life and labour -- at least such, as far as the service of an unknown and feeble individual usually leads, I have never found it fail me: if it has not for the poor and needy circumstances of time, through which we feebly pass, I am assured it never will for eternity.<a name=3:12></a> "The word of the Lord abideth for ever.<a name=3:13></a>" If it reaches down even to my low estate, it reaches up to God's height because it comes thence: as the love that can reach even to me, and apply to every detail of my feebleness and failure, proves itself divine in doing so: none but God could, and hence it leads me up to Him.<a name=3:14></a> As Jesus came from God and went to God, so does the book that divinely reveals Him come from and elevate to Him.<a name=3:15></a> If received, it has brought the soul to God, for He has revealed Himself in it.<a name=3:16></a> Its positive proofs are all in itself.<a name=3:17></a> The sun needs no light to see it by.<a name=3:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This, indeed, has made me hesitate as to how far it is to the purpose to go through much of the matter of this book -- that part, I mean, which takes up the objections to scripture.<a name=3:19></a> My only reason is, that they are thrown down before a multitude of minds, as every one knows, in these days -- a heartless and sickly age, which finds its refuge, from the cold and desolate waste of infidelity and human wilfulness, in the more pleasing imagery of imposed superstition.<a name=3:20></a> The man of intelligence produces human infidelity.<a name=3:21></a> The man of imagination will give us human superstition, coloured over with the haze of antiquity, for fear what it really is should be too clearly seen.<a name=3:22></a> Both give me man.<a name=3:23></a> The scriptures alone give me God.<a name=3:24></a> Hence the peculiar form of modern infidelity is, attack on the written word -- the scriptures Superstition takes exactly the same ground.<a name=3:25></a> The cry of "Bibliolatry!<a name=3:26></a>" sounds alike from the intellectual and from the superstitious infidel.<a name=3:27></a> Both have the same object of attack, both are infidels -- one an intellectual, the other an imaginative one.<a name=3:28></a> Both would persuade me that the Bible cannot itself command my conscience and oblige me to faith as coming from God.<a name=3:29></a> Do they not both seek to do this?<a name=3:30></a> Is it not infidelity?<a name=3:31></a> Doubtless, through the sinfulness of man's will, without divine grace, he never will really receive the word as it is in truth -- the word of God.<a name=3:32></a> But is that his fault or the word's?<a name=3:33></a> Infidels and superstitious persons will both tell me that the word itself has not divine authority over my soul; that I cannot receive it as such on its own authority without something more to prove it.<a name=3:34></a> It is hard to say who is guiltiest here: he who denies it is the word; or he who, not denying that it is, declares that what God has said cannot bind the conscience of man unless validated by some authority other than its own.<a name=3:35></a>

		I should not certainly have entertained these objections even in order to reply to them; but they had already done positive mischief to many, and shaken the comfort, and agitated the minds, more or less, of many accustomed to confide simply in the word with real faith.<a name=4:1></a> Most Christians have met with examples.<a name=4:2></a> One which came in a painful way under my own observation led me to read, and, in result, to answer the book.<a name=4:3></a> Some who have read the MS.<a name=4:4></a> have desired that it should be printed.<a name=4:5></a> It was not like a book of edification, which, if it failed to attain its end, came simply under the negative charge of being profitless or stupid.<a name=4:6></a> It was worse than this to occupy the mind with questions, if there were not positive good to be done by it.<a name=4:7></a> The book is meant for those who have been already occupied with these questions.<a name=4:8></a> Knowing that to feed on the word is what the soul wants, not to discuss it, I have no desire that any should read it before whose mind the subject has not already come.<a name=4:9></a> But how large alas!<a name=4:10></a> this class is now as well known to most interested in these subjects.<a name=4:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I desire to add one remark here in reference to inspiration.<a name=5:1></a> I beg to avow, in the fullest, dearest, and distinctest manner here, my deep, divinely-taught conviction of the inspiration of the scriptures.<a name=5:2></a> That is, while of course allowing, if need be, for defect in the translation and the like, when I read the Bible, I read it as of absolute authority for my soul as God's word.<a name=5:3></a> There is no higher privilege than to have communications direct from God Himself.<a name=5:4></a> I say this, because, in reasoning with infidels in the body of the book, I have sometimes done so on their own ground, to shew how untenable their positions were -- how unreasonable their complaints, even setting aside inspiration.<a name=5:5></a> Indeed, did not the scriptures claim this authority, no one would dream of calling in question their authenticity or the evidence on which they rest.<a name=5:6></a> Such a method might lead some unguardedly to suppose hesitation or want of depth of conviction on my part.<a name=5:7></a> My joy, my comfort, my food, my strength, for near thirty years, have been the scriptures received implicitly as the word of God.<a name=5:8></a> In the beginning of that period, I was put through the deepest exercise of soul on that point.<a name=5:9></a> Did heaven and earth, the visible church, and man himself, crumble into nonentity, I should, through grace, since that epoch, hold to the word as an unbreakable link between my soul and God.<a name=5:10></a> I am satisfied that God has given it me as such.<a name=5:11></a> I do not doubt that the grace of the Holy Spirit is needed to make it profitable, and to give it real authority to our souls, because of what we are; but that does not change what it is in itself.<a name=5:12></a> To be true when it is received, it must have been true before it was so.<a name=5:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And here I will add, that although it require the grace of God and the work of the Holy Ghost to give it quickening power, yet divine truth, God's word, has a hold on the natural conscience, from which it cannot escape.<a name=5:14></a> The light detects "the breaker-up," though he may hate it.<a name=5:15></a> And so the word of God is adapted to man, though he be hostile to it -- adapted in grace (blessed be God!<a name=5:16></a>) as well as in truth.<a name=5:17></a> This is exactly what shews the wickedness of man's will in rejecting it.<a name=5:18></a> And it has power thus in the conscience, even if the will be unchanged.<a name=5:19></a> This may increase the dislike of it; but it is disliked because conscience feels it cannot deny its truth.<a name=5:20></a> Men resist it because it is true.<a name=5:21></a> Did it not reach their conscience, they would not need to take so much pains to get rid of and disprove it.<a name=5:22></a> Men do not arm themselves against straws, but against a sword whose edge is felt and feared.<a name=5:23></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Reader, it speaks of grace as well as truth.<a name=6:1></a> It speaks of God's grace and love, who gave His only-begotten Son that sinners like you and me might be with Him, know Him -- deeply, intimately, truly know Him -- and enjoy Him for ever, and enjoy Him now; that the conscience, perfectly purged, might be in joy in His presence, without a cloud, without a reproach, without fear.<a name=6:2></a> And to be there in His love, in such a way, is perfect joy.<a name=6:3></a> The word will tell you the truth concerning yourself; but it will tell you the truth of a God of love, while unfolding the wisdom of His counsels.<a name=6:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is because I have found it all this, feeble and unworthy as I am, and because it is the scriptures that have made God thus known to me through grace, that I have ventured on ground to which I am not much accustomed; from which I gladly retire, to use the word which I here in a particular case attempt to defend.<a name=6:5></a> I have sometimes feared I might be a little like David with Saul's armour on.<a name=6:6></a> I have done it, I trust, in love to the Lord and to the souls of others, yet with some reluctance.<a name=6:7></a> Let me add to my reader, that by far the best means of assuring himself to the truth and authority of the word is to read the word itself.<a name=6:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In fine, I would say, that as I am conscious I have no claim to literary honour, so I neither pretend to nor desire it.<a name=6:9></a> I hope I may have been, in general, sufficiently clear to be understood.<a name=6:10></a> I would only beg my reader kindly to remember, that sometimes the subjects are somewhat abstract; and while he who publishes anything must expect, of course, to be criticised (if what he writes is indeed worth it), I would so far claim indulgence as one may who has snatched from hours of rest almost the whole time occupied in composing what the reader has before him (service in ministering amongst souls from day to day, and other labours in the Lord's field, needless to mention, fully occupying all ordinary hours of toil).<a name=6:11></a> If I am useful to any, and the Lord accepts it as service done to Him, I am content.<a name=6:12></a> I think one or two points are twice referred to from being connected with different subjects.<a name=6:13></a> It is not very material.<a name=6:14></a> If it be so, the reader will excuse what other labours forbid my now correcting.<a name=6:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I draw the attention of my reader to one point, on which this whole question of revelation greatly hangs in the reasoning of those with whom we have to do.<a name=6:16></a> I have noticed it in the body of the book from feeling it was really the basis of their reasonings.<a name=6:17></a> I have since seen it laid down as the foundation of them by a French writer of this class in his attacks on scripture.<a name=6:18></a> It is this -- that man is not capable of other ideas than those his own mind can create or produce.<a name=6:19></a> These may be awakened by some occasion, but they must exist in an abstract sense.<a name=6:20></a> This is true, as to mathematics, because they are the expression of the relationship of quantity or form, and these are perpetually inherent in what is subject to the mind of man, and what he has the capacity of pursuing to all its consequences.<a name=6:21></a> But in moral facts it is quite otherwise.<a name=6:22></a> Every being who has a superior moral nature to mine will produce acts, of the influence of which I am susceptible, though quite incapable in virtue of being morally inferior.<a name=6:23></a> Nay, so true is this principle, that the same act done by beings of a superior nature or position has an entirely different moral character and effect.<a name=6:24></a> If that nature and position are infinitely superior, the difference is infinite, the obligation quite of another character; yet the act may be quite intelligible, even through my wants.<a name=6:25></a> I do not measure it, but I know a love, if the act be one of love, which is beyond my measure.<a name=6:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=7>[Page 7]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus Christianity tells us, that "God was manifest in the flesh" to fulfil a work of self-sacrifice for me.<a name=7:1></a> A man's sacrificing himself for me would present the highest human claim on a grateful heart; but God's doing it (that new, lovely, yet infinite fact, capable of filling the whole moral world,) puts all that world in a new condition.<a name=7:2></a> Again, take the moral difference merely: man could die for a benefactor perhaps, but he is not capable, in true simple-hearted love, of unostentatiously dying for an enemy; God's becoming a man to do it silences the heart, and creates, by the sovereign title of love, a new order of feeling.<a name=7:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The result is, that the notion that new moral thoughts which no human investigation could reach cannot be produced, cannot be communicated, is utterly and stupidly untrue; and of these truths man is abstractedly incapable of judging but by the effect and thoughts produced by them.<a name=7:4></a> He becomes capable of estimating them by the change which takes place in his state in virtue of them, and not by pre-existing thoughts; he receives the new moral ideas from the objects and grows up into them.<a name=7:5></a> This is eminently true of Christianity, as an unexampled divine act, for and in man.<a name=7:6></a> I reserve the answer to the French rationalist for another occasion, if God permit.<a name=7:7></a> He has stated more definitely the basis of the argument; and, consequently, the gross absurdity of the system is more palpable.<a name=7:8></a>

		<a name=8>[Page 8]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The heart and conscience, then, is capable of impressions, of effects, which neither could produce; because beings in a higher order of moral nature can act on principles, and with rights entirely above man, and yet can act on and towards him in things he was wholly ignorant of before, which meet his need, but which no moral effort could, by any possibility, have produced, because they proceed from a nature superior to his.<a name=8:1></a> It is a false assumption, that man is so constituted that he is not capable of a certain impression by an act of which he was wholly incapable of forming an idea before it was accomplished by another.<a name=8:2></a> He knows it as so accomplished by the superior being in the effect produced in his heart by it.<a name=8:3></a> I do not doubt that there is a divine work wrought in communicating the knowledge of it; but on that ground I do not enter here.<a name=8:4></a>

		INTRODUCTORY REMARKS
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		HOW, AND HOW FAR, CAN GOD BE KNOWN BY MAN?¦
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When a man makes his own mind the measure of his knowledge of good, he soon sinks to the level of that by which he measures it; indeed he is already sunk there morally.<a name=9:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is the case with Mr.<a name=9:2></a> N.<a name=9:3></a> He judges of what God ought to be, of what a revelation ought to be if there was one, by his own mind and feelings.<a name=9:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A book presents itself as a revelation from God; and he judges that it is not one.<a name=9:5></a> By what rule is his judgment formed?<a name=9:6></a> By what his own mind is, independent of revelation, which he subjects to the test of his own thoughts, when the book is presented to him as such.<a name=9:7></a> He can do this only in virtue of the competency of his mind to judge, before he has received it, what a revelation ought to be.<a name=9:8></a> That is, his own mind, and even his own mind in its present state, is the measure by which revelation is to be judged of.<a name=9:9></a> Were it so, the mind of God must be on a level with the mind of man, and even of the particular man who judges.<a name=9:10></a> But the fallacy of such a principle, as well as the excessive self-sufficiency of it, is evident.<a name=9:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, the measure of what the divine Being ought to be or require (for if it be a revelation by Him, it must declare what He is, or what He requires) will vary with the moral condition or the natural disposition of each individual who seeks to form a judgment.<a name=9:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		More than this, it will vary with the circumstances in which a man is placed, with the age of the world in which he lives, with everything through which he has passed in emerging out of the state of natural ignorance of all things in which he began his life, and which have exercised an influence in forming his character.<a name=9:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It would be mere folly and ignorance of human nature, blindness to the most obvious facts, not to recognize these influences in the forming and moulding of the human mind, and thus their power in colouring its judgment of all around and above it.<a name=9:14></a> Does Mr.<a name=9:15></a> N.<a name=9:16></a> think he has not profited by the influence of the Christianity he rejects?<a name=9:17></a> He miserably deceives himself if he does.<a name=9:18></a> But, to do him justice, he does not think so.<a name=9:19></a> In another volume of his (it is well the confession is absent from this) he avows (speaking of the New Testament, with the devotional parts of the Old, and declaring his intimate knowledge of it), "to it I owe the best part of whatever wisdom there is in my manhood.<a name=9:20></a>" (Soul, page 242.<a name=9:21></a>) But of this farther on.<a name=9:22></a> He will not suppose that he himself soars entirely above the ken of the moral discernment of others as to his own condition, since he accounts himself capable of judging what God and a revelation ought to be.<a name=9:23></a> He has profited, he tells us, by the wisdom and piety of this false Messiah.<a name=9:24></a> But he thinks he has emancipated himself from the trammels of a revelation which he does not believe, and emerged into the truthful results arrived at by the logical and philosophical workings of the human (let us say the word, of his own) mind.<a name=9:25></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And this leads to another very important point.<a name=20:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Morality, properly speaking, is relative; that is, it flows from relationships in which we stand to others, and in which we owe such and such things to them in virtue of the claim upon us which their position gives them.<a name=20:2></a> I do not mean by this that intrinsic purity of heart is not to be sought, and the subjugation of passions in their workings within us.<a name=20:3></a> No Christian could question it for a moment.<a name=20:4></a> It is peace in itself.<a name=20:5></a> We ought to be pure: it is a good in itself, and it is the practical condition of communion with God: "Be ye holy, for I am holy;" and, as it is stated in a passage we have already cited, "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.<a name=20:6></a>" This claim of purity distinguishes Christianity as revealing God.<a name=20:7></a> No other religious system knew it; for none associated man with a God known to be light, and who called us to walk in the light as He is in the light.<a name=20:8></a> Love also in exercise where it is not relatively due is the proper characteristic of the Christian.<a name=20:9></a> And these two distinguishing characteristics flow from this blessed and glorious truth -- that the Christian partakes of the divine nature, and hence is called to imitate it in practice.<a name=20:10></a> "That eternal life which was with the Father, and was manifested to us" (as John teaches us, in Christ, so that He should be an absolute practical example to us) is also "true in Him and in us" whose life He is, "because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth.<a name=20:11></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=21>[Page 21]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is the christian life.<a name=21:1></a> Without disputing about words, I do not call this morality, though it be really that which is the spring of and accomplishes it; because the proper and natural display of life in us is not properly obligation, though that life may, in this display, fulfil those obligations.<a name=21:2></a> Now morality, I apprehend, is, properly speaking, the maintenance of obligation.<a name=21:3></a> Of this latter we will now speak.<a name=21:4></a> In its nature, and by the force of the term obligation, it is, as I have said, relative.<a name=21:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before entering on this point, I would notice the connection, as stated in the scriptures, between the two; that is, between our partaking of the "divine nature," and our fulfilment of moral obligation.<a name=21:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Love worketh no ill to his neighbour; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.<a name=21:7></a>" Here this principle of the divine nature communicated to us accomplishes what would be a moral obligation enforced by the law; but the two things are distinguished.<a name=21:8></a> And then love goes farther also, because there is positive active energy in it, where there is no relative obligation.<a name=21:9></a> While I say no obligation having this nature, I clearly have it to live in it, and so also please God, which itself is the highest obligation.<a name=21:10></a> Hence, "he that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.<a name=21:11></a>" So the Lord Himself united both, even to the giving of His life.<a name=21:12></a> "But that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father hath given me commandment, so I do.<a name=21:13></a>" The precepts of the gospel are the guidance of this nature, according to the perfection and perfect wisdom of Him who is its source; they are heeded by us in the obscurity of our feeble nature and distracting passions, and give (as ought to be the case, as it was in Christ) to the movements of the divine nature in us the additional character of obedience.<a name=21:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=22>[Page 22]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It remains then true, that what is called generally and properly "moral obligation" is necessarily and in its nature a relative thing.<a name=22:1></a> And hence the measure of it is the claim which the being in relation to whom I stand has upon me in virtue of that relationship.<a name=22:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this sense it is, though the expression be very incorrect, that morality is eternal.<a name=22:3></a> First, if we consider as morality our own (or, to use the modern word, our subjective) state (to which the term is hardly properly applied), the love and holiness which become a man are the communication of the nature of God Himself, and are eternal in their source and character.<a name=22:4></a> But secondly, morality, properly so called, drawing its source from the claims attached to certain beings with whom I am in relationship, in virtue of which they are in that relationship, is as unchangeable as the relationship itself.<a name=22:5></a> For "eternal" in this case has only the meaning of absolute and unchangeable when the relationship exists; that is, the relationship being known, the duty attaches to it essentially.<a name=22:6></a> Thus, father and son, for example, is a known relationship.<a name=22:7></a> The relationship of father and son cannot exist without certain relative duties necessarily arising.<a name=22:8></a> The obligation is inherent to the relationship of father and son amongst human beings, and so in other cases.<a name=22:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But this shews the importance of a revelation.<a name=22:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the first (that is, our likeness to the divine nature), it is absolutely necessary; for God is unknown in His real perfection without it.<a name=22:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the latter (that is, moral obligation properly so called), it has equal importance in another way, namely, that the revelation which God makes of Himself creates an obligation commensurate with that revelation.<a name=22:12></a> If the Son of God has died for me -- is my Saviour and my Lord, it is clear He has a claim morally upon me, according to what He is as so revealed, and what He has done.<a name=22:13></a> That is, a revelation creates a part of morality; just as a woman's marriage does by her entering upon a new relationship with her husband, with this difference, that the obligation of marriage is abstractedly known in itself, whereas what is newly revealed then first begins even to be known as an obligation.<a name=22:14></a> The obligation takes its origin from it.<a name=22:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Some remarks may be added here.<a name=22:16></a> The mere capacity of nature to enjoy or stand in certain relationships does not constitute a base of morality; the relationship itself must exist.<a name=22:17></a> An orphan may have a nature susceptible of all the feelings and obligations of a child toward a parent.<a name=22:18></a> The moral tie does not exist, because the claim of the parent cannot be there.<a name=22:19></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next, holiness in its nature, and love, as we speak of it here, suppose sin, though it may be only known as the opposite of the nature which knows it.<a name=23:1></a> Innocence is not holiness; it is ignorance of evil.<a name=23:2></a> God is holy, for He knows good and evil, and is perfectly good, and evil is perfectly abhorrent to Him.<a name=23:3></a> We have the knowledge of good and evil; hence naturally our conscience is bad; but if holy, and as far as holy, we abhor the evil we know, and know as evil, when it is present, in the measure of our holiness.<a name=23:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Love too, as we know it in God, is exercised in respect of evil; for evil exists and exists in us, and He loves us in that state.<a name=23:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, the understanding of perfect holiness by a sinful nature is, as to its own capacity, impossible.<a name=23:6></a> Conscience may so far understand it as to see its opposition to sin, and angrily or in terror dread the consequences; but an unholy nature does not comprehend or know a holy one in its separation from evil, as to affections -- will -- delight; for it has contrary ones.<a name=23:7></a> So, indeed, of love: "He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.<a name=23:8></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To say that a man is not a sinner is mere folly and insensibility to good and evil, and the strongest possible proof of ignorance of God and hardness of conscience.<a name=23:9></a> "Thou thoughtest," says he whose piety Mr.<a name=23:10></a> N.<a name=23:11></a> declares he delights in (Phases, pages 223,232), speaking in God's name, "that I was altogether such a one as thyself; but I will reprove thee, and set before thee the things that thou hast done.<a name=23:12></a>" To say that he is a sinner<a href="#23:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> is to confess his incapacity of knowing God, or judging of Him, or the revelation He gives of Himself, unless sin (that is, an opposite moral nature in thought and desire -- in insubjection too of will) be the capacity to know Him.<a name=23:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But if we consider morality, properly speaking, as grounded on relationship, it is clear and easily made evident that man cannot, and ought not, to suppose in his own mind the only thing which God can be to his comfort.<a name=23:14></a> For in that for which man is responsible to God he has failed.<a name=23:15></a> I ask not the cause.<a name=23:16></a> I am willing here to take the ground Mr.<a name=23:17></a> N.<a name=23:18></a> takes (proof as it may really be, as I shall shew, of indifference to God's presence and favour).<a name=23:19></a> I will suppose that sin is come in neither by following Adam, nor by inheriting his fallen nature; that it is all the pure fruit, without other cause, of man's own individual will.<a name=23:20></a> Be it so.<a name=23:21></a>

		If my child had been very naughty and offensive to me (and it is nothing compared to sin against God), and he were to say, "Of course my father will forgive: forgiveness is a proper thing that suits his character -- is becoming conduct;" would not his state be really worse than his offence -- his conscience shewn to be hard?<a name=24:6></a> Conscience -- right feeling -- thinks of what we have merited from those good and gracious, when we have offended them, and judges itself, though it may be attracted by grace.<a name=24:7></a> The heart which coolly expects forgiveness, because it suits the character of Him we have offended, is in a state which unfits it for receiving it.<a name=24:8></a>

		And here I may take up Christianity itself, because I only shew that, being what it is, there must be a revelation to communicate it: the sinner's mind ought not and could not judge it, or appreciate it, or suppose it, unless it were revealed.<a name=24:10></a> It declares a love of God which gave His only-begotten Son, One with Himself, the object of His infinite delight before the world was, for vile and polluted sinners.<a name=24:11></a> It declares that the Son came in the exercise of this same love, giving Himself for them to put away their sin and bring them to God -- thus known to be perfect love to themselves -- and with a conscience which knows that He imputes no sin to them at all (without diminishing, nay, giving a far deeper sense of His holiness), because His character had been perfectly glorified about it.<a name=24:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#28:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>I must be allowed to put the reader here on his guard against misapprehension, as if highest conceptions were the same thing as highest qualities. The expression does limit God's perfections to man's conceptions. All the poison of such a thought is there in full. But most of men's good qualities are inapplicable to God, as belonging to a creature: awe, reverence, gratitude, admiration, love to a superior, all that concur in adoration are necessarily excluded from the notion of God. When we partake of the divine nature, through a grace which has set us in perfect peace as to ourselves, we can love in a divine way, and love righteousness in a divine way. Otherwise we cannot. We must have a justly lovable object to call out a correspondent affection, or it will be an idolatrous passion towards an unworthy one. To love, in supreme sovereign goodness, is an absolutely divine quality. "God is love." Hence, at once, the apostle says, "He that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God"; he derives this from Him, and He is the supreme object of it. This characterizes the divine nature as communicated to us. I can also understand and delight in righteousness in itself and holiness, being made partaker of His holiness, and renewed in knowledge after the image of Him that created me in righteousness and true holiness. But while conscience has anything to say, I cannot love them simply, though that conscience may see them to be right and good, because I cannot and ought not to love to be condemned, nor be content to be defiled, supposing goodness to be as great as may be. But righteousness condemns me, and holiness shews me to be defiled.<p>The truth is, all this attempt to project God out of our conceptions is confusion, just because we are creatures, and excellence in a creature is a different thing. And hence there is incompetency to see what God ought to be or must be; though I may in a measure know what He may approve in me, which is another thing, but which will never carry us up to the being which approves. Secondly, we are sinful creatures; hence what God can be to us ought not even to be estimated by us. And lastly, no conception of mind can estimate love. "He that loveth not, knoweth not God; for God is love." It never can be said, Man is love. A creature cannot be; he h bound to something else which bars him from supreme love. He may know it in supreme love to him as a sinner, and thus, but thus only, rise to its source. He knows it supreme and infinite, because it reached him: supreme, because there was nothing lovely in its effect; infinite, for nothing is so far from supreme love as enmity against it, and this was the condition of his proud heart. So even Mr. N. confesses, for he admits an antagonist will. And what else is that but open moral opposition against supreme good, and a refusal to bow to it? How is that to be loved' and if loved, is it to be sanctioned? or how reconcile entire condemnation of it, and yet perfect love to him that is in it? This the cross has solved, but not Mr. N. He has known too much of Christianity not to make all his system absurd by that which he has introduced into it, as it was, without this, by all it left out. <p>The cross, Mr. N. will tell us, is not just. No; it is love. But it is love exercised in such a condemnation of sin as makes its exercise consistent with righteousness, that is, the necessary and desirable display of God's opposition to evil. Christ was willing to offer Himself up, that God might be thus known and man saved.

		ANIMUS OF THE EXAMINATION
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before examining the details of Mr.<a name=38:15></a> N.<a name=38:16></a>'s book, I would yet make a general remark.<a name=38:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The kind of opposition men make to Christianity proves its truth in the main -- proves in it the consciousness of a real claim of God on the soul.<a name=38:18></a>

		No doubt men have attacked Paganism as false.<a name=39:1></a> They have resisted Mohammedanism, though its sword was its principal argument, so that there was less of this.<a name=39:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the constant and laborious exercise of free criticism, the close and sifting examination the Bible has gone through for ages, the anxious research after errors or contradictions within, proves anxiety to shew that it is not what it pretends to be.<a name=39:3></a> Why all this anxiety?<a name=39:4></a> Those not immediately under the influence of Mohammedanism are long satisfied that it is false, and leave it there; but these minute researches after a flaw in the scriptures continue -- are repeated -- renewed.<a name=39:5></a> Men take it up on every side.<a name=39:6></a> Astronomy and geology are called in aid.<a name=39:7></a> Geography is ransacked: history, antiquity, style, manuscripts of all kinds, foolish writings of the fathers, absurd writings of heretics, apocryphal imitations of its contents; nothing left unturned to find something to discredit it; wise writings of philosophers to prove they could do as well, or were the source of the good, or even of the alleged absurdities of doctrine; every other influence sought out which could have moralized humanity, that it may not be supposed to be this.<a name=39:8></a> Why all this toil?<a name=39:9></a> Why, if it be a doctrine like Plato's, should it not have produced its effect, and our philosophers be as cool about it as about other things?<a name=39:10></a> It has -- their conscience knows it has -- God's claim and God's truth in it; and they will not allow that the true God, that Christ, is the source of it, for then they must bend, and admit what man is.<a name=39:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And this shews itself in the most curious way.<a name=39:12></a> Though they pretend to think nothing of Christ, or that He was an impostor, they will not allow that the authorized books of His religion give a true account of the doctrines of the religion.<a name=39:13></a> If I read the Koran, I am satisfied to take it as the account of Mohammedanism, absurd as it may be; and I say Mohammedanism is absurd.<a name=39:14></a> So of the Vedas and Puranas.<a name=39:15></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#43:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>I was going to give the old attempt to define a straight line, namely, "the shortest between two given points," which, evidently, is no definition at all. It is a mere quality of a straight line. But I judge something of an accurate definition may be given, as being that described by "a point moving always invariably towards, or in the direction of, the same point." A curve is a line described by a point which always leaves the direction it last followed. But this attempt does not affect the proof, that a true and even powerful impression may be produced by an idea not defined. Neither truth nor power is in definition, important as this may be in its place. Moral power and truth are in the bringing home to the soul the real relationship in which we stand to anything, and the obligation resulting from it, in the way of revelation of the character and conduct of that to which we are related, and hence the motives which flow from it. How this is brought home is another question. As a Christian, I believe it will only be by a new nature and divine grace. But this is not my subject here. Christianity reveals enough of God to make Him known to us in this way, and elevate us to Him by it. It does not pretend to define Him as He is. Creeds may be useful as contradicting false notions, but are, to say the least, most imperfect and unsatisfactory as communications of truth. I judge the matter of the Athanasian to be, perhaps, the least objectionable.

		<a class="footnote" name="#73:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>These testimonies are of comparatively late date. They are in the Gemaras, not the Mishna; but this rather confirms the truth. If we receive the christian records, the Jews were forced to own notable undeniable miracles done before the eyes of the multitude. Comparatively speaking, contemporary hostile accounts are silent on the subject (I speak of Jewish doctors), and later ones do not dream of denying them, admit the facts, and attribute them to magic. Celsus (a heathen author, who lived some fifty years after St. John, as quoted by Origen) does not deny the miracles, but ascribes them also to magic. The Talmudists speak of instantaneous cures wrought by the name of Jesus. The passages are quoted by all the authors and commentators who have treated this subject at any length. Lightfoot is the usual book of reference for the English reader.

		PARTICULAR OBJECTIONS -- GENEALOGY IN MATTHEW
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I turn to the particular objections.<a name=79:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first is, that Matthew was under manifest mistake in inserting fourteen names instead of eighteen, and in saying that there were only fourteen generations.<a name=79:6></a> This is a poor objection in presence of the moral power of the gospels; it shews a mind descended on low ground: but we will consider it.<a name=79:7></a> That Matthew has omitted three kings, none disputes; but this does not prove he made a mistake in doing so.<a name=79:8></a> The point he is shewing is Christ's legal connection with the throne of David: this, the omission of the three names did not in the smallest degree affect.<a name=79:9></a> The descent and the proof of it remain identically the same.<a name=79:10></a> Matthew and every one else knew of these three kings.<a name=79:11></a> What was his motive in omitting them may or may not be discoverable; but it does not affect the descent.<a name=79:12></a> What he gives is <i>perfectly</i> right.<a name=79:13></a> Mr.<a name=79:14></a> N.<a name=79:15></a> says, "I was struck with observing that the corruption of the two names, Ahaziah and Uzziah, into the same sound (Oziah), has been the cause of merging four generations into one.<a name=79:16></a>" (Phases, page 107.<a name=79:17></a>) Now this is a mere assertion<a href="#79:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> without the smallest foundation whatever.<a name=79:18></a> In the genealogy in 1 Chronicles, where the names are found together, there is no similarity in sound or anything else.<a name=79:19></a> Uzziah is not used, but Azarias, which does not resemble Ozias in sound or in any way.<a name=79:20></a> In the general history there are long chapters Or details which absolutely preclude all confusion.<a name=79:21></a> Where did this corruption of both names into the same sound exist?<a name=79:22></a> Not in the LXX: there, where brought together, we have jOcozivu" and Ajzamiva".<a name=79:23></a> Nor is there any confusion between these names.<a name=79:24></a> Uzziah is called Ozias by the LXX in 2 Chronicles.<a name=79:25></a> But there is not the smallest ground whatever for saying there is any confusion with Ahaziah.<a name=79:26></a> Azariah and Uzziah are much more alike in Hebrew, and even interchanged; but it is Ozias in Greek where it is read Uzziah, and Azarias where it is read Azariah.<a name=79:27></a><a href="#79:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a> But with Ahaziah there is never any confusion whatever.<a name=79:28></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#82:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>Thus Josephus calls Jehoiakim jIwacimou, saying Nebuchadnezzar killed him, and made jIwacimou, his son, king. And Clement of Alexandria expressly says, After jIwakei;m oJ oJmwnumo" aujtou' jIwakei;m reigned three months. Irenaeus says (lib. 13, 30, end of 21 Bened. edit.), "Joseph, Joacim et Jechonia filius ostenditur." <p>St. Jerome insists largely on this (in Daniel 1), saying, "Ob hanc causam in Evangelio secundum Matthaeum una videtur deesse generatio quia secunda -- tessarakaidekav" -- in Joachim desinit filio Josiae, et tertia incipit a Joachin filio Joacim. Quod ignorans Porpheytrius calunian struit ecclesiae, suam ostendens imperitiam, dum Evangelistaeo Matthaei arguere institur falsitatem." Jehoiachin is called jIwakeim twice in Jeremiah 52: 31. In 4 (i.e., 2) Kings 24: 6 it is said, jIwake;im, (or ke;im) slept with his fathers, and jIwakim his son reigned in his stead, and so on in the chapter, and at the end of chapter 25. I may add, that considering the two Jechonias as distinct makes the fourteen more easily reckoned; otherwise David is reckoned twice, as closing the first fourteen and beginning the second. The only apparent difficulty (which Epiphamius settles by inserting jegevnnhse jIeconiva" but he cannot be trusted) is, that it is not said Jechonias begat Jechonias; but this is easily understood, because the captivity intervenes and breaks the thread of the genealogy entirely. The whole history of Israel ceased, and the kingdom. If the reader prefer this solution, I have no objection. It appears that it was rather after the captivity of Jechonias (he was then only eighteen) that his son was born. The reader may see that these objections are as old as Porphyry, and how early, as I stated, everything was minutely examined.

		<a class="footnote" name="#84:f2"><sup>++</sup></a>Wetstein, for instance, considers the genealogy of Luke as the natural or direct genealogy of Joseph, and Matthew, the derivation of the royal title which was in the collateral line. This is a question really of the construction of the Greek phrase; for as we have not the registers to settle which it is, it may be of course, as to the names, either. It does not affect the substantial question as to our blessed Lord in the least. The inspiration of the gospels, and His mission as Son of David, rest on other proofs altogether; and that once proved, and His claim authenticated by His miracles and all other evidence, He is certainly Son of David, and the particular object of the genealogies is an independent question. Mr. N. has assumed that it was to prove Him really and naturally the son of David; but this is merely his assumption. <p>Matthew certainly deduces his legal title, not his natural descent. What Luke's is is a question interesting in its place, but only so for its own merits. The total want of force in Mr. N.'s argument is shewn in this, that supposing Luke had given an unexceptionable genealogy of Mary -- that is, one to which no objection could be raised -- and given it avowedly as Mary's genealogy, what possible proof should we have now that it is exact, but faith in his inspiration, and the absence of proof to the contrary, or his general fidelity as an historian? That is, its correctness must rest on the general proofs of Luke's fidelity or inspiration, which are to be looked for elsewhere. And in fact, in the gospels the testimony that He was Son of David is always rested on other grounds; while it does not appear, on the other hand, that the genealogy was ever contested. It is a mere delusion to advance the difference between the two genealogies as an objection, because Matthew's is avowedly the royal legal tide in Joseph. Now if the natural genealogy were given in Luke, there would be no kind of necessity that they should be the same. If it be counted from Mary, for the greater part it could not be.

		If taken as Joseph's natural descent, this would prove that the object of the genealogies was, not to give Christ's descent according to the flesh by Mary, but, first, the natural descent of Joseph from David, and, secondly, His being that one of such descendants to whom the crown belonged; Matthew giving the latter, Luke the former.<a name=86:1></a> The descent from David, which was only necessary to the accomplishment of Jewish promises, was rested, to the Jews, on their known authentic records and acknowledged principles.<a name=86:2></a>

		I would lead the attention of my reader to another point here.<a name=90:1></a> Let him read Stephen's speech, and he will find a very brief but most perfect and complete summary, for application to the consciences of the Jews, of the history of the patriarchs from Abraham to the end of Joseph's history -- a summary which supposes the most perfect and accurate knowledge possible of the details of the history; a man thoroughly master of the whole account given in Genesis, and carrying it in his mind, as all perfectly well known, so as to give in few words the whole moral bearing of all its parts.<a name=90:2></a> It would have been impossible for any one, leaving aside inspiration (and if inspired, the question is at an end), for any one not perfectly familiar with every part of it to have given such an abridgment of the history.<a name=90:3></a> But it would have been equally impossible for a person so informed, and master of his subject, to have made such a mistake; because the facts were connected with most interesting points in Jewish history, which made the deepest impression on their memory, and connected themselves with their earliest and strongest associations, and are in the history itself too entirely distinct, and accompanied with far too great a detail of different circumstances to allow of the supposition of any confusion of mind between the two.<a name=90:4></a> The supposition, therefore, that Stephen confounded the two, is, in every point of view, the most improbable solution of any one that can be made.<a name=90:5></a> This, it is true, is nothing for a sceptic, because he gains his point by it, or at least raises a doubt.<a name=90:6></a> That his reasoning is very absurd is no matter to him; because, if he can produce a doubt, faith is at an end.<a name=90:7></a> Hence he uses arguments which would be absolutely unreasonable in any human enquiry, and at once rejected.<a name=90:8></a>

Zechariah, son of Iddo, priest and prophet, was, according to the Targum, slain in the temple (and I suppose, as Targums are not inspired, we may credit them historically); and Zechariah, son of Iddo, priest and prophet, was son of Berachiah, -- son of Iddo, as we know from the record itself, meaning grandson. Zechariah, son of Berachiah, *is* said, in the New Testament, to have been slain between the temple and the altar -- as the Targum says of Zechariah, son of Iddo, whom Nehemiah proves to be son of Berachiah.

		HARMONIZING THE GOSPELS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to harmonizing the gospels, it is a great mistake in principle.<a name=104:1></a> The Spirit of God has (as I have said, and as is evident to an attentive reader) given in each gospel what referred to a particular character and particular instructions of Christ; and facts referring to this subject are recorded, and such parts of discourses as apply to them; the connection of the facts being in many cases the object,<a href="#104:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> and not the historical order -- many being related without any date at all, the Spirit of God not attaching any the least importance to the time when, but to what was said, in what circumstances.<a name=104:2></a> In some respects, there is a progress in the development of certain subjects which is chronological, such as the growing spirit of rejection of Jesus among the Jews, and the substitution of a new order of things.<a name=104:3></a> Yet in giving this general chronology (which is seen, for instance, in Matthew<a href="#104:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a> very evidently, and all relating to the subject fully developed), the details which point out certain parts and moral elements of unbelief may be classed according to the subject, in order that we may understand their bearing.<a name=104:4></a> The same fact may be confirmed by another evangelist and put in historical order exactly, or in some other moral connection.<a name=104:5></a> We dislocate the whole purposed contexture of the gospels in trying to put them into common continuous order.<a name=104:6></a> It may be in some respects interesting to search it out, but quite subordinate to the general purpose for which they are written.<a name=104:7></a> I have tried so to arrange them, and I have not found the thing impossible; but I have found it takes the passages quite out of the order in which they were meant to stand.<a name=104:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Besides, we have a very <i>limited</i> portion indeed of the facts of the history, which enormously increases the difficulty of putting it together; because the links which connect the facts historically are often wholly wanting.<a name=104:9></a> There may be six months between two facts mentioned in one verse, in the same sentence, if these two facts refer to one subject; and these two facts may be dispersed amongst a number of others in quite different connection elsewhere, and if one be morally important on a particular subject, it may be put after one chronologically subsequent, without a note of time.<a name=104:10></a> This is actually the case; because the object of the Holy Ghost is to give us certain moral pictures of Christ as Son of David, Son of man, and as Son of God, a divine Person, and of God's ways with men in Him -- not to make out a full biography.<a name=104:11></a> Such alone, I am bold to say, could have been God's way of dealing.<a name=104:12></a>

	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#104:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>I may remark here, in passing, that the expression used by Luke, "to set forth *in order*," applies far more often in Greek to order of subjects (i.e., a regular account, not mere notes) than to order of time.

		THE SENTENCE ON THE SERPENT: SERPENT WORSHIP
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Mr.<a name=109:1></a> Newman sneers (he must forgive me the word) at the sentence on the serpent (Phases, page 110), the meaning of which is evidently the entire humiliation of the serpent.<a name=109:2></a> Going on its belly and eating dust would present this thought to any one familiar with scripture.<a name=109:3></a> The import of the words is, beyond all question, the expression of judicial degradation, and the feeding on it even to its fullest extent in the symbol of death.<a name=109:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence his full final judgment is expressed in these words: "And dust shall be the serpent's meat.<a name=109:5></a>" But this one sentence, thus ignorantly scorned, gives the source, explanation, and judgment of what has characterized the universal race of man over the whole globe, to an extent without rival; unless, perhaps, the worship of the sun, which was generally identified with it.<a name=109:6></a> Where the polished idolatry of Greece and Rome (with which, I dare say, Mr.<a name=109:7></a> N.<a name=109:8></a> is well acquainted) has never penetrated, the exaltation of the serpent has reigned paramount, and even in all its details proved the truth of the Mosaic account of the fall.<a name=109:9></a> Indeed, the allusion of Mr.<a name=109:10></a> N.<a name=109:11></a> here is unfortunate; for the fact that a single verse of simple statement accounts for what has governed the whole world, though it embraces nothing of the corruption that characterized what so governed it, is the strongest possible proof of the divinity of the record we possess.<a name=109:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is evidently impossible for me here to give an account of the Ophiolatreia, or Serpent worship.<a name=109:13></a> I can only notice some of the remarkable elements of it.<a name=109:14></a> It is found in China, Egypt, Babylon, England, France, Ireland, North America, Mexico, Peru, Russia, Scandinavia (i.<a name=109:15></a>e.<a name=109:16></a>, Sweden and Norway), Greece, Italy, Africa in its most savage parts, Palestine, India -- in a word, all over the world.<a name=109:17></a> It is connected with the principal gods of the East, of Greece, of Rome, and with the most solemn worship of the countries I have mentioned.<a name=109:18></a> In Sweden and Norway, and in Macedonia serpents were kept in the houses as household gods; in Greece and elsewhere, in temples as public ones.<a name=109:19></a> They were considered the preservers of Athens, as of Whidah on the coast of Guinea; and the savage of Louisiana carried a serpent and the sun, as the symbols of his religion, and tattooed them on his skin.<a name=109:20></a>

		If we turn to the elements which characterized it, we find it accompanied with a tree, and a naked woman constantly its priestess.<a name=109:21></a> In India and Mexico, the deliverer is bitten in the heel by the serpent, which in these and other cases is destroyed by being smitten on the head.<a name=109:22></a> Further, he is worshipped often erect, and not prostrate on his belly, and was fed alive with sweet cakes of honey.<a name=109:23></a> We find him frequently associated with a tree, and conversing with a woman.<a name=109:24></a> And this in countries, in sculptures, and in heathen accounts, which leave no possibility of alleging fraud or intention.<a name=109:25></a>

		Another remarkable fact connected with it was, that the notion of gaining wisdom from serpents was universal.<a name=111:1></a> This went even to the notion, that eating their flesh gave it.<a name=111:2></a> They gave oracles.<a name=111:3></a> The progress of idolatry seems to have been this: Satan seized upon the idea of God in men's minds, and the obscure traditions of what had happened.<a name=111:4></a> Where he could, he connected this directly with himself; and serpent worship was universal, as we have seen.<a name=111:5></a> Still, the sun being the great and splendid benefactor of man, and in unity, man's heart connected this with the one supreme God.<a name=111:6></a> This allied itself with the universe.<a name=111:7></a> Thus the serpent and sun worship (both being intimately associated with the idea of the unity of Deity and the universe) became connected.<a name=111:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Sometimes the worship of the sun drove out the serpent worship in its grosser form, yet was always connected with it: how should it be otherwise?<a name=111:9></a> Thus Apollo, who is the sun, established his worship at Delphi by slaying Typhon, an immense serpent, who was also said to have been cast down from heaven by Jupiter.<a name=111:10></a> He then gave oracles in his place.<a name=111:11></a> Still the serpent was sacred to him, and was otherwise associated with the Delphic worship.<a name=111:12></a> So in the Scandinavian mythology, the great serpent produced by the evil spirit, Loke, against the supreme God, is cast into the sea.<a name=111:13></a> He is the enemy of the gods; Thor will destroy him, but he will die in doing it.<a name=111:14></a> So the wolf, produced by the evil spirit, now chained, will in the end break loose and devour the sun.<a name=111:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On the other hand, Hercules, and other such mystic personages answering to Thor in many respects, a kind of god-man, destroys serpents in all manner of fables.<a name=111:16></a> And Krishna in India, and Teotl in Mexico, reproduce traditional accounts of scripture redemption, connected with what is said of the serpent in Genesis.<a name=111:17></a><a href="#111:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> Caesar produces as the doctrine of the Druids, that man's sins could only be expiated by man's death.<a name=111:18></a>

		Now idolatry, as far as we can say from scripture, came in only after the flood.<a name=111:19></a> Hence we have the next step in idolatry, a vague tradition of a reign of bliss under Saturn, which recalled Paradise; and then his three sons, Jupiter, Neptune, and Pluto, who become the supreme gods of heaven, earth, and sea; that is the three sons of Noah (the ark being so distinctly remembered, that in the grand procession they carried a statue about in a kind of ship).<a name=111:20></a> Indeed, it is very probable that the Greek word translated "temple" is really identical with that of "ship.<a name=111:21></a>" In fine, the worship of the serpent connected itself with that of the sun and whole host of heaven; and, in cultivated Greece and Rome, merged, though retaining both, into traditions as to Paradise, Noah's three sons, and the flood.<a name=111:22></a> The purest of all serpent worship was perhaps in England.<a name=111:23></a><a href="#111:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a>

		This serpent worship retained its power longer than we suppose.<a name=112:1></a> In idolatrous Egypt, so judged in scripture, there was a sect of Gnostics who connected it with their pretended Christianity, and, under the name of <i>Ophites</i> (that is, "serpent worshippers"), had a living serpent, which was let out to glide over the sacramental elements to consecrate them, it being the source of wisdom (exactly as was done with Isis,<a href="#112:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> the great object of serpent worship, on whose temple was written, "I am all that hath been, and is, and shall be; and my veil no mortal hath ever removed;" and exactly as the worship in England was carried on in the serpent temple at Abury and other places, as recorded in British bards' writings of that day): so in Brittany in France, where the remains of these dragon temples are abundant, it is curious to see the mounts ("barrows" as they are called) where the sun was worshipped with the serpent, now all dedicated to St.<a name=112:2></a> Michael, whom the Revelation presents to us as the destroyer of Satan's power.<a name=112:3></a> And within man's memory, in a village wake, the serpent worship was commemorated, though none understood what it meant.<a name=112:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I have said enough to demonstrate the importance of shewing that the serpent was to go on his belly and eat dust.<a name=112:5></a> The world has consecrated it -- has shewn the place the serpent had in its history.<a name=112:6></a> The connection of it with the worship of the host of heaven is shewn in the fable that Minerva, the goddess of wisdom, seized hold of the great serpent that was attacking Jupiter and the gods, and flung it into heaven, where it became the constellation Draco.<a name=112:7></a> Indeed, all the constellations are idolatrous gods.<a name=112:8></a> And, to this day, the planets known to antiquity are all marked by the symbolical signs connected with this worship -- that of a circle and cross.<a name=112:9></a>

		In a word, while many traditions of truth were preserved, the serpent was deified.<a name=112:10></a> The Englishman little knows, when he tends his sheep or ploughs over Hackpen, that the hill he has beneath his feet has for its name "the serpent's head," for such, in old British, is the meaning of "Hackpen" (and there was the head of the immense serpent formed by stones, the circle of deity through which it passed being in the centre, and known as Abury, a name which is undoubtedly supposed to recall the universal name given to the serpent as worshipped); nor that Arthur Pendragon is "<i>Uther</i> of the dragon's head;" nor that when he calls his "mother," he uses most probably one of the names of Isis, the Egyptian goddess, which identifies death and the woman, for <i>Moth</i> signifies "death.<a name=112:11></a>"<a href="#112:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that God, in the revelation of Himself, employs different names for the purposes of that revelation, which bring out some particular character in which He is pleased to act in the display of Himself, every one who has paid the least attention to scripture is perfectly aware of.<a name=114:3></a>

		3.

		Now this is the whole matter in what is objected to.<a name=114:15></a> As soon as God begins to unfold His ways with His creation, to be in relationship with it as a subsisting thing, and the ground on which this is based and manner in which it has been formed is developed, He reveals Himself as being that very Jehovah whom the Jews knew as their God.<a name=114:16></a> When it was the mere fact of creation in power, the great thing was to shew that God, as such, did it.<a name=114:17></a> <i>Elohim</i> created, <i>Elohim</i> made; but when God is teaching what He was for this creation, and how He took such a place, He takes a name of relationship in which those to whom the revelation was addressed knew Him as their God.<a name=114:18></a> He is not called simply Jehovah, but <i>Jehovah-Elohim</i>, so as to connect the two thoughts, and shew the Jehovah their God as Elohim the Creator, the supreme source of all things.<a name=114:19></a> And this was of the very last importance.<a name=114:20></a> Germans and infidels, who are altogether ignorant really of the whole scope and purport of scripture, naturally find some reason within the scope of their infidelity (which cannot reach beyond a question of documents) for what is really altogether a perfection, and a pretty evident one for such as are at all attentive to scripture.<a name=114:21></a>

Hence John urgently insists, "That which was from the beginning, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have heard, which we have looked upon, which our hands have handled, of the Word of life." That is, he calls back to *what was from the beginning* as the safeguard against all seduction. It is remarkable that, as soon as he had got thoroughly infidel, Mr. N. could get on good terms with his brother, who had got thoroughly papist, and not before. This tells a tale few are prepared to believe. It is a sign, too, of the times.

For the question is on the "heart and intention," which Mr. N. says was as bad in Abraham as in Moloch's worshippers. I have no doubt that the devil had brought them to this -- taught them this frightful worship. "The things which the Gentiles offer, they offer to devils, and not to God." But Mr N. cannot take this ground, because he believes not in such a work of Satan. If he does, he thinks that the devil can communicate -- reveal -- a religion to men, but that God cannot. I treat it, therefore, as the simple fruit of man's heart; and thus this voluntary act of atrocious cruelty, in which man's heart did become the maker of his own god, as Mr. N. wishes, and in which this god was the projected image of his heart; this voluntary unnatural depravity to get such a god in some way to help it, to gratify in some way its own lusts, is not at all worse, according to Mr. N., than Abraham's sacrificing his own heart's feelings and everything he could lean upon, at the *express command* of a God whose constant love, faithfulness, and power he had known and believed in, and now trusted to give him his son back again. And a judgment such as this, to Mr. N.'s mind, is the proved falsity of scripture morals!

	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#130:f2"><sup>++</sup></a>This is equally true, ever since, because Christians accept the Old Testament as a work of the we God, though the true light did not then shine. Indeed, the doctrine of human progress adopted by Mr. N. and his sect is the most heartless and vile idea imaginable. It is just a knot of self-complacent men, who think they have got a good deal of light that nobody else has, coolly consigning, as if by the arrangements of God (not as a dismal effect of sin and departure from Him, as Christians do), all the millions, for six thousand years, to darkness and the horrors of paganism, in order that they may have the light now. And mark the notable arrangement -- their God (for certainly it is not ours) turns man out of His creating hands in this state of atrocious wickedness, darkness, and brutality, to get on some how if he can, by gradual discoveries confined to a few philosophers, to some degree of light at the end, when the scene is to cease. It is not the case of a child in the sweet simplicity of guileless confidence with all to learn. Burning men in immense wicker images of their own form, as British Druids did, is not simplehearted childhood; nor is it cultivated corruption (flexible polytheism is the word), like that of Corinth. The Fall makes this intelligible; but without it, when one thinks of the point of departure, and that we are creatures of God, the system of progress is the most atrocious and absurd one can well conceive. And what progress! It is, that, at the end of six thousand years, a few philosophers can speculate heartlessly on those who have been in this darkness before them. But I shall say a little more on this, and other points connected with it, in a few pages of Appendix.

		But for this purpose, how many things very different from God's will and thoughts, contrary to what God would have inspired, and of a mixed character when He has acted on the affections, shall we find!<a name=135:1></a> If God shews us the truth, we must have things as they really are.<a name=135:2></a> We must have an apostle's failures as well as all else -- man's path, under the highest power of the Holy Ghost bestowed upon him.<a name=135:3></a> For this end he must often express <i>himself</i>.<a name=135:4></a> Only with this we need the positive revelation of God's own mind in an unquestionable way to be able to judge, supposing we are spiritual, of all this; and that the scriptures afford us.<a name=135:5></a> This human character is, in the New Testament, especially drawn out and unfolded.<a name=135:6></a> In the Old, we have the history of man divinely given, and certain oracles imparted with "thus saith the Lord," with comparatively little, save in the Psalms, of the effect of the working of the Holy Ghost in man, so as to produce affections and thoughts in which the divine spring is seen, but the forms of human thoughts, because it was the Holy Ghost working in man.<a name=135:7></a> In this latter case, there may be various degrees of spiritual clearness of thought according to the state of the person in whom the Holy Ghost works.<a name=135:8></a> It may be such as spiritual men have now, only of course the thoughts conformed to the state of the dispensation.<a name=135:9></a> Thus it was, as we have seen, in the case of Deborah's song; and if I am to know man and God's dealings, and man under them, I must have this.<a name=135:10></a> A person may be filled with the Holy Ghost, and so express his mind, that though it be his feelings, and so given, yet what nature would have produced is absent; and it is only what the Holy Ghost has produced, though in <i>his</i> heart.<a name=135:11></a> Thus his heart is a proper vessel of the Holy Ghost; and his utterance may be recorded as being really of God, and proper inspiration, though in a human heart.<a name=135:12></a> Thus the song of Hannah has, I doubt not, this character, though not given as inspired, and expressive of her own feelings and apprehension of God's ways, as such must be to be real.<a name=135:13></a> So Elizabeth's song in Luke 1 -- Zachariah's in the same chapter -- Simeon's in chapter 2.<a name=135:14></a> In these cases, such outgoings of heart, being directly from the Spirit, will be prophecies, properly speaking.<a name=135:15></a> Such we have in the Psalms, though they be expressions often of feelings in the writer's heart at the time, and, I doubt not, prepared for the remnant of Israel in the latter day, as giving them divine comfort in their tried feelings and exercised hearts then.<a name=135:16></a>

		This kind of working of the Holy Ghost even in our hearts, and that in cases where our minds are not sufficiently taught of God to know what to look for, is spoken of in Romans 8, where he says, "He who searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for us with groanings that cannot be uttered.<a name=136:2></a>" It is merely saying, that the Holy Ghost can work in the affections where the intelligence may not be sufficiently formed to express itself on particular subjects, or point out the positive answer to these affections.<a name=136:3></a> If before-hand God communicates the answer to a heart so exercised, it becomes real prophecy or inspired truth, as well as divinely given feelings.<a name=136:4></a> If even the Spirit gives such expression to the sorrow of the heart that it should be according to God, this may be more than personal, though it be such, and rise to the full revelation of that personal or sympathetic sorrow, which was in the heart of Jesus from the same causes more fully developed, and without counteracting or modifying evil.<a name=136:5></a> And this might be without the knowledge, in him who uttered it, of what it applied to.<a name=136:6></a> Such a principle is clearly recognized in the New Testament; for Peter speaks of the prophets who, by the Spirit of Christ which was in them, testified beforehand of the sufferings of Christ, and the glory which should follow, and they searched what and what manner of time it referred to, and found it was not for themselves but for us.<a name=136:7></a> The Jews had the same notion, and as an opinion it was well founded, though they joined unsound notions as to inspiration with it.<a name=136:8></a> They taught that there was the <i>gradus Mosaicus</i>, or "Moses' degree;" the <i>gradus propheticus</i>; and the <i>Bath-kol</i>, or "Daughter of a voice" -- the first two founded on Numbers 12: 6-8, and the third characterizing the <i>chetubim</i> or <i>hagiographa</i>.<a name=136:9></a> This did not touch the authority but the character of the writings, but it is often of deep interest to know the manner of God's speaking to us; though, in whatever way He may speak, His word has always the same authority.<a name=136:10></a> Not one jot or one tittle can pass from the law, and all that is written in Moses, and in the Prophets, and in the Psalms concerning Christ, must be fulfilled.<a name=136:11></a> Yet when the apostle says, "God, who at sundry times and in divers manners, spake in time past, hath in these last days spoken to us by the Son [in the Son, in the person of the Son ejn uiJw<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#6:136">footnote</a></i>/ ]," is it not of the deepest possible interest to see the testimony of God brought to us in the person of the Son Himself?<a name=136:12></a> -- God Himself speaking there?<a name=136:13></a> For He whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God, "for God giveth not the Spirit [to Him] in measure.<a name=136:14></a>" Everything there was the expression of God Himself.<a name=136:15></a> It was not "Thus saith the Lord," for some precious sentences, and then a man's relapsing into his ordinary though perhaps sanctified existence.<a name=136:16></a> All that came forth breathed God -- God in human kindness, philanthropy; as the apostle speaks, "God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself.<a name=136:17></a>" If He took up a child; if He spoke to a sinner; if He sat at the well wearied, with a yet more weary and desolate heart beside Him, a woman who came alone at that strange time to draw water, one justly in one sense ill seen by men, and yet however dark, perhaps with secret wants beyond them, a sign to His eye that the fields were white for harvest; if He touched an outcast leper with a gracious and sovereign "I will" -- all told that God was there, amongst men -- with men, because of men; and gracious words proceeded out of His mouth.<a name=136:18></a> Surely they made men wonder; for how long had they been away from God.<a name=136:19></a> And if a prophet's words were just as sure because the Spirit of Christ really spoke to them, yet surely I need not speak of the bright and blessed interest which accompanied the existence of such a testimony as His who spake as never man spake.<a name=136:20></a> A Saviour's words came, if indeed heard, with divine grace itself to the ear.<a name=136:21></a> It was the mercy that it spoke of.<a name=136:22></a> "If thou knewest the gift [free-giving dwmea;n ] of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink [who has come so low as to be dependent on you for a drink of water]; thou wouldst have asked of him [entire confidence of heart in God -- such a God!<a name=136:23></a> -- would have been produced, nor would it have been disappointed in grace or in power to answer], and he would have given thee living water.<a name=136:24></a>"

		<a class="footnote" name="#137:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>The following are Mr. N.'s statements on this head: -- "It is true, that even in the primitive structure of things, we discover much which at first shocks us. Physical pain in many aspects appears not as an accident and an abuse, but as if definitely designed. Fierce beasts are observed to be armed for inflicting misery, and the instincts of one creature are often directed to destroy the quiet and comfort of another, which may seem not to have earned hostility. On this subject whole volumes might be written, as ample arguments have been. Here it may be sufficient to remark, that the difficulty turns on the epicurean assumption, that physical ease and comfort is the most valuable thing in the universe: but that is not true, even with brutes. There is a certain perfection in the nature of each, consisting in the full development of all their powers, to which the existing order manifestly tends; and any one who shall speculatively reconstruct the organized world, and logically follow out his own scheme, will probably end in discerning, that the present arrangements of God are better than man could have devised. As for susceptibility to pain, it is obviously essential to every part of corporeal life, and to discuss the question of degree is absurd. On the other hand, human capacity for sorrow is equally necessary to our whole moral nature, and sorrow itself is a most essential process for the perfecting of the soul. Not to have discerned the relation of sorrow to virtue is perhaps the most striking defect pervading all the Greek moral philosophy. <p>"More permanent disturbance of mind is caused to good men who have no extensive view of human nature, nor habit of mental analysis, from the prevailing wickedness of mankind. It avails not here to say that human goodness is only a relative idea, and that however much better men were, we should still think them bad, since our standard would have risen. In a mere moral view, indeed, such a reply suffices for all tribes of men have some morality. Those who are ferocious towards foreigners are often tender-hearted towards their own people; and the difference of savage from civilized virtue is one of degree. But religiously the case is otherwise; for there is a chasm between loving God and not loving Him, serving Him and not serving Him. We can easily suppose such an improvement in human nature, that though all would of course be still imperfect, yet none should be irreligious: and men will ask, Why does a good God leave so large a part of mankind in irreligion? To many this is an exceeding severe trial of faith, because irreligion has been invested with eternal consequences, which binds the understanding in a net absolutely inextricable. But let the Gordian knot be cut; let it be discerned that the infinite cannot be the meed of the finite; then, while we lament the actual state of the world, we shall not find it hard to understand that it has necessarily resulted from the independence of the human will, which must be left free and capable of resisting the divine will, otherwise we should not be men, but brutes or machines. Assuming then that evil is finite, transitory, and only an essential condition towards the attainment of a higher and permanent good, we find nothing in human wickedness, however intense, and whatever misery it causes, to inspire rational doubt of the divine goodness. <p>"That there is abroad among us an unsound view of supreme goodness (or benevolence, as it is called), cannot, I think, be denied. It is akin to that spurious humanity, which so shudders at putting a criminal to death, as to prefer keeping him alive even where there is no human hope of his being recovered to virtue, but every probability of his incurring more and more desperate hardness. The benevolent man is supposed to shrink from inflicting bodily pain on any one, whether for his own good, or as a necessary process for defending others; and where this morbid notion prevails, we must expect people to be much shocked at the broad facts of the natural history of animals, to say nothing of man himself ... . Pain and suffering are undoubtedly among God's most efficacious means for perfecting all His creatures, and, not least, man; but they must needs be with Him means not ends, if we are to attribute to Him in any sense that which we are able to recognize as goodness; and consequently they must be His plans, either partial and subordinate, or finite and transitory. All theology which contradicts this, darkens and distorts the face of God to us." (Soul, page 43-46.)

		But to return.<a name=139:1></a> The inspiration of the New Testament is interesting in another way.<a name=139:2></a> The Holy Ghost Himself is come down to dwell in the saints, and to take the things of Christ and shew them to us; and He dwells in us as a seal that we are children of God, heirs of all, and joint-heirs with Christ.<a name=139:3></a> He at the same time brings all the love of God into the sorrows of the way, enables us to apprehend according to God the present state of things, while it marks out a road suited to those who are one with Christ in heaven, for His members by the way.<a name=139:4></a> Hence the New Testament is not, in the <i>general</i> tenor of its revelations, a mere testimony of "Thus saith the Lord.<a name=139:5></a>" It has this prophetic character sometimes; but in general it is the expression of the mind and the sympathies of God in all that concerns the saints on earth.<a name=139:6></a> It is the Holy Ghost in a man, who is a member of the body, communicating all the privileges of the body to it, and entering into all its sorrows, while it reveals the love and wisdom of the Father and the Son, leading into all truth, and casting the perfect light of God on all that went before, and shewing things to come; in this last having more the character assumed before in prophecy, as we read, "The Spirit speaketh expressly;" "Let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches," etc.<a name=139:7></a> Hence there is -- while often rising to the most glorious testimonies of blessing in the revelation of God, and of His designs for the glory of Christ and the Church with Him -- a familiarity, an entering into detail as to all that concerns the body, and what becomes its heavenly path down here -- an expression of the feelings of the instrument who addresses it, which gives the most touching picture of the effect of the presence of the Holy Ghost, and brings down the love of God into the detail and circumstances of man's christian life.<a name=139:8></a> It is not, indeed, after we pass the gospels, Christ Himself; but it is His Spirit lifting His members up to Him by the revelation of Him, and coming down to them in all their trials and conflicts, in all through which they pass, to be the spring of feeling there, through His assured sympathy.<a name=139:9></a> Such God would shew Himself; and surely all that He says there has the tenderest claim and the perfect authority of Him who speaks thus in love.<a name=139:10></a> It is the word of God; the Holy Ghost on earth, in the apostle or prophet, speaking generally in the Church; but not an inferior, separate Spirit; but as He hears so He speaks, in union with the Father and the Son -- the wisdom of God amongst men.<a name=139:11></a>

This shews how much the mind is connected with the expressions used in communicating truth.

		Now Isaiah 7 begins by alluding to a prophetic and mystic son of the prophet -- a common prophetic figure -- called, "the remnant shall return.<a name=148:1></a>" (Shear-jashub.<a name=148:2></a>) According to the Old Testament doctrine, this would immediately suggest the thought of Messiah.<a name=148:3></a> So we find the pious Simeon and Anna prepared at once for the thought, and the disciples asking, Are the swzovmenoi, the spared remnant, few in number?<a name=148:4></a> [translated, "few that be saved"?<a name=148:5></a> Luke 13: 23.<a name=148:6></a>] Now Ahaz began the apostasy of David's family, the last stay of Israel; for, on the people "Ichabod" had long ago been written, and David raised up, and the peace and safety of the people made dependent on the faithfulness of his family in an express manner.<a name=148:7></a> 2 Chronicles 7: 17-21.<a name=148:8></a>

		Now Ahaz walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and made his son pass through the fire; he made molten images also for Baalim, and (though perhaps after this prophecy) introduced an idolatrous altar, after a Damascus pattern, into the temple, and set aside the brazen altar for himself to use as an oracle.<a name=148:9></a> To him Isaiah comes with his "remnant shall return," and addressing himself to the house of David, and referring to their unbelief and rebellion, judges it, and gives as a sign from God the birth of the virgin's son.<a name=148:10></a> Now that a<a href="#148:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> virgin should marry and have a child is nothing that can be a sign from God, nor anything particular to do with the house of David.<a name=148:11></a> Nor would there be any reason for calling his name Immanuel, that is, God with us.<a name=148:12></a> I know it has been said -- Mr.<a name=148:13></a> N.<a name=148:14></a> does not condescend to say why "an unbiassed interpreter" would not apply it to Jesus<a href="#148:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a> -- that Hezekiah was meant, in whose reign there was deliverance for Israel.<a name=148:15></a> Now Hezekiah had been born several years before the date of the prophecy.<a name=148:16></a> Thus the application of the prophecy to David's promised Son is the most natural and only intelligible one of the passage.<a name=148:17></a>

		THE PROPHECY OF ENOCH
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Mr.<a name=151:3></a> Newman next refers to another common objection.<a name=151:4></a> Jude has quoted the prophecy of Enoch.<a name=151:5></a> He has this excuse that this is commonly so stated, since Archbishop Lawrence published his book; and Origen has taken it for granted.<a name=151:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I beg leave to say, that there is not the smallest proof of any kind that he has done so.<a name=151:7></a> The fathers are historically very useful, like all contemporaneous authors; their judgment, and not the least so Origen's, is nothing worth.<a name=151:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now what proof have we that Jude quoted this book?<a name=151:9></a> Just none.<a name=151:10></a> It is evident that there was a traditional account that such a prophecy existed.<a name=151:11></a> This book of Enoch records it.<a name=151:12></a> Jude authenticates the prophecy as far as his authority goes.<a name=151:13></a> But that Jude took it from the book of Enoch, there is not the slightest proof whatever.<a name=151:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Enoch, all know, was favoured of God; the prophecy ascribed to him is a testimony of a doctrine established by a multitude of passages.<a name=151:15></a> Its written preservation in christian times was more timely, as then Christ's coming in glory was the immediate and proper hope of the Church.<a name=151:16></a> While at all times a most solemn prophetic warning, it was less suited to be preserved as a part of the divine record, while God was still carrying on His government under the law.<a name=151:17></a> Everything is in its place.<a name=151:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is the simple fact of the existence of the passage in both Jude and Enoch, which is used as a proof that it is quoted, which is no proof at all, because it is evident each may have taken it up if it was current by tradition.<a name=151:19></a> And the copying is very much less probable than the latter supposition, because the passage is not the same in both.<a name=151:20></a> It is thus given by Archbishop Lawrence: "Behold, He cometh with ten thousand of His saints, to execute judgment upon them, and destroy the wicked, and reprove all the carnal for everything which the sinful and ungodly have done and committed against Him.<a name=151:21></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=152>[Page 152]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus it stands in Jude: "And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints, to execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodlily committed, and of all their hard [speeches] which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.<a name=152:1></a>" Now, that these passages refer to the same prophecy I see no reason to doubt; but I do not see the smallest sign that one was copied from the other.<a name=152:2></a> They differ very sensibly one from the other.<a name=152:3></a> There is nothing about what ungodly sinners have spoken in the book of Enoch -- no expression such as "destroy the wicked" in Jude.<a name=152:4></a> The phraseology too in Jude is quite different and very peculiar.<a name=152:5></a> I should say, from the language and omissions, that it certainly was not a quotation.<a name=152:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, further, the doctrine also is very different.<a name=152:7></a> The book of Enoch makes God come to execute judgment <i>on His saints</i>.<a name=152:8></a> There is no such doctrine as this in Jude.<a name=152:9></a> And the book of Enoch distinguishes particularly executing judgment on them, <i>the saints</i>, and destroying the wicked.<a name=152:10></a> No such idea as this exists in Jude.<a name=152:11></a> Nor is it a mere question of Ethiopic,<a href="#152:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> which I certainly could not solve.<a name=152:12></a> It is the positive doctrine of the book of Enoch, "while judgment," it is said, just before, "shall come upon all, <i>even all the righteous</i>.<a name=152:13></a>" Thus His executing judgment upon them [the preserved] is the specific doctrine of the passage.<a name=152:14></a> It certainly is not that of Jude; for he says Enoch prophesied of the reprobate.<a name=152:15></a> And, while speaking of executing judgment on all, there is no such a thought as executing judgment on the saints and destroying the wicked.<a name=152:16></a> Jude goes on to speak of His convicting the ungodly for their deeds and their words against Him.<a name=152:17></a> So that the substantial meaning of the passages is quite different, as one contains what the other does not; and the language is quite diverse too.<a name=152:18></a> I conclude, with undoubting certainty, that one was not quoted from the other (unless the author of the Book of Enoch used Jude <i>in his own way</i>), and that Jude's is divine, accordant as it is with the whole testimony of the word, and the apocryphal Enoch's human.<a name=152:19></a>

		But further: What proof have we that the book of Enoch was written first?<a name=153:1></a> I doubt it exceedingly.<a name=153:2></a> Dr.<a name=153:3></a> Lawrence takes as his fixed point of departure, in making the enquiry, that the quotation of Jude proves it was written before his epistle.<a name=153:4></a> But this is begging the question.<a name=153:5></a> I have already shewn that, to say the least, it is an assumption without any proof (what can be adduced in the way of evidence proving, as I judge, the direct opposite).<a name=153:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Indeed, the proof that the writer was before Jude is to me very doubtful.<a name=153:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are passages which seem to be quoted from the New Testament.<a name=153:8></a> Some of them I should not insist upon, because they may have been proverbial, and so used by the Lord Himself among the Jews.<a name=153:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		They are the following:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"It would have been better for them had they never been born.<a name=153:10></a>" "At that time I beheld the Ancient of Days while he sat upon the throne of his glory, while the book of the living was opened in his presence, and [while] all the powers of the heavens stood around and before him.<a name=153:11></a>" "And he, the Son of man, shall be the light of nations" (this may be from Isaiah).<a name=153:12></a> "But in the day of their trouble the world shall obtain tranquillity.<a name=153:13></a>" "In these days shall the earth deliver up from her womb, and hell deliver up from hers that which it has received.<a name=153:14></a>" "The word of his mouth shall destroy all the sinners and all the ungodly, who shall perish at his presence.<a name=153:15></a>" "Trouble shall come upon them as upon a woman in travail.<a name=153:16></a>" "Before the Son of man, from whose presence they shall be expelled.<a name=153:17></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These look very like allusions to passages in the New Testament.<a name=153:18></a> But there is another circumstance.<a name=153:19></a> The writer says, referring to the destruction of the temple at Jerusalem, "Then I grieved extremely on account of the tower, and because the house of the sheep was overthrown.<a name=153:20></a> Neither was I afterwards able to perceive whether they again entered that house.<a name=153:21></a>" Now this comes <i>after</i> a passage (chapter 88: 92) where it is said, "I saw, too, that he forsook the house of their fathers and their tower, giving them all into the power of every beast," which refers to the Babylonish captivity; and after he had announced the call of seventy accountable shepherds, which Dr.<a name=153:22></a> Lawrence himself applies to the rulers from Nebuchadnezzar down to Herod the Great.<a name=153:23></a> So that the destruction here alluded to was under or after the seventy shepherds; whereas their accountable rule began with Nebuchadnezzar: so that this was evidently another overthrow of "the house of the sheep.<a name=153:24></a>" At any rate, as he gives the Jewish history up to Herod, he must have known they had their house again; indeed, he speaks evidently of Zerubbabel, Joshua, and Nehemiah or Ezra, and of the rebuilding of the temple.<a name=153:25></a> (Phases, page 113.<a name=153:26></a>) This would lead one then to suppose that he wrote after the destruction of Jerusalem<a href="#153:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> by the Romans, and was thus unable to say that the temple would be restored.<a name=153:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#153:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>In chapter 104 he turns back to consider the conduct and accountability of the shepherds already spoken of from the beginning (chapter 103 having closed the direct history, which would much confirm its being the Roman destruction of the temple).

		One passage looks very much as if he considered the Christians as a perverse race; but that a remnant would be preserved, to whom the power and glory would be given.<a name=154:1></a> At any rate, he speaks of the Jews being perverse at this epoch.<a name=154:2></a> These are his words, "Afterwards, in the seventh week [coinciding with that in which Christianity appeared], a perverse generation shall arise; abundant shall be its deeds, and all its deeds perverse.<a name=154:3></a> During its completion the righteous selected from the plant of everlasting righteousness [a remnant of the Jews] shall be rewarded, and to them shall be given sevenfold instruction concerning every part of his creation.<a name=154:4></a>" (Chapter 92: 12.<a name=154:5></a>) After this they shall execute judgment on oppressors, sinners shall be delivered up into the hands of the righteous, and the house of the great King shall be built up for ever.<a name=154:6></a>

		The next has more appearance of reason in it to a person who does not believe, nor consequently apprehend the bearing of the gospel accounts.<a name=166:6></a> It is this: Matthew states that the Lord was taken into Egypt; Luke, that after they had performed all things according to the law for Him, they returned to Nazareth.<a name=166:7></a> I cannot of course take popular habits of traditional belief in such an enquiry.<a name=166:8></a> Mr.<a name=166:9></a> N.<a name=166:10></a> of course can take them, and trouble people's minds by an objection to them.<a name=166:11></a> Such traditions it may be difficult to reconcile with other facts related, although the soul may sometimes lose little by the difference between the tradition and the history.<a name=166:12></a> Such traditions may be a mere careless interpretation of a particular fact.<a name=166:13></a> Thus it is assumed that the Magi's visit was at the time of Christ's birth.<a name=166:14></a> Who has not seen them from early youth represented amid asses and oxen, kneeling before a mother and a new-born babe with glories round their head?<a name=166:15></a> Now, morally, the departure from the history, if such means are to be used at all, is not very material.<a name=166:16></a> But there is not a tittle in the history given in scripture to prove that the Magi came at the moment of Christ's birth, but a good deal to shew that they did not.<a name=166:17></a> It is pretty evident from Herod's inquiry as to when the star appeared (Matthew 2: 7), that that appearance was at His birth.<a name=166:18></a> Now they may have taken their time to prepare to start; they certainly must have taken time for their journey -- how much I do not pretend to say.<a name=166:19></a> Some little time was spent at Jerusalem before the visit.<a name=166:20></a> Further, Herod sends and kills from two years old and under, according to the time <i>which he had accurately inquired of the wise men</i>.<a name=166:21></a> Now we may well allow that Herod's jealousy and cruel character would have left margin enough to secure Him at all events, and that he was not particular about how many suffered.<a name=166:22></a> But, as it is said, according to the time accurately ascertained from the wise men, it must be certainly rather supposed that Jesus must have been on towards two years, or at least not just born.<a name=166:23></a> The woman's offering for a male child was thirty-three days after its birth.<a name=166:24></a> To kill all from two years and under, after accurately ascertaining that the child was less than thirty-three days old (which must have been the case if their visit was before Mary's presenting Him in the temple), would have a character of needless cruelty beyond all reason, particularly when it is said that he did so according to the time which he had diligently or accurately inquired of the wise men.<a name=166:25></a> There is a relation between the age of the children killed and the babe's age in Herod's mind accurately formed, and he slays them according to that accurate information.<a name=166:26></a> Now if he had ascertained Him to be less than a month old, and killed all under two years old, there was no relation between them whatever.<a name=166:27></a> All this shews that the presenting in the temple preceded the visit of the Magi, and there may have been even ample time to go to Nazareth and return to Bethlehem for the visit of the Magi.<a name=166:28></a> But that that visit was not made in the crowded state of the inn, spoken of at the time of His birth, is made probable by the fact, that the wise men came into the house to offer their gifts.<a name=166:29></a> There is no appearance of Jesus being then in the manger.<a name=166:30></a> Whatever other call they may have had, His parents certainly came up once a year at the feast of the passover.<a name=166:31></a> Their being, therefore, again at Bethlehem was nothing extraordinary.<a name=166:32></a>

		Now in answering an alleged contradiction, to shew that the facts can be reconciled, is a complete answer.<a name=167:1></a> Now both the narratives in this way may be true.<a name=167:2></a> Even supposing Luke is speaking of an immediate departure, it is a very probable thing that, being enregistered, and having performed their duty in the temple, they should go home; while the occurrence of such circumstances as accompanied the birth of Jesus would almost naturally bring them back to David's city, with the Jewish feelings they had; and these poor people had nothing to connect them with Nazareth more than another place.<a name=167:3></a> They were in that miserable place perhaps from poverty.<a name=167:4></a> It was, not, at any rate, a place they had any tie to.<a name=167:5></a> If their son was the divinely-sent Heir to David of Bethlehem, whither would such a thought lead them?<a name=167:6></a> The circumstantial probabilities connected with the slaying of the infants tend to shew some time had elapsed.<a name=167:7></a> The birth of the babe mentioned in Matthew connects itself with the regal title associated with that place in every Jew's mind, and not with the date of the event.<a name=167:8></a> The important matter was that He was born there; for so not only prejudice but prophecy claimed; and it is in this connection it is used in Matthew.<a name=167:9></a> But the fact is, the "when" in English (which to the simple English reader is a natural note of time) has nothing to answer to it in the Greek, which is merely "Now Jesus having been born in Bethlehem of Judea" -- a fact of all importance to His history, and to this passage in particular.<a name=167:10></a> There is no note of time more particular than "In the days of Herod the king" -- a fact also indirectly material to His history, and which tends to set aside the idea of a more accurate note of time being given in the same passage, and to give a general character to the statement.<a name=167:11></a> Hence nothing is more easy than the connection of the facts, while the objection falls to the ground.<a name=167:12></a>

		At the same time, I must express my conviction that, while Luke says nothing but what is quite consistent with Matthew's history, he does not mean to give any note of time in the passage The Spirit's object in Matthew was to shew Christ's meeting the fulfilment of all that Jewish scriptures declared of a Jewish Christ, and such a one's rejection.<a name=168:1></a> In Luke's Gospel it was quite otherwise.<a name=168:2></a> He was shewing a Christ who, connected with Adam by His human nature, though He sinlessly fulfilled all looked for in a Jew, opened the door of faith to Gentiles in spirit; who was, in a word, Son of man.<a name=168:3></a>

		Hence, having shewn Him duly accomplishing what the law required, this gospel at once transplants Him, neglecting all else, to the position in which all the Gospels place the Lord, as having given up the Jews, considered as attached to the temple and Jewish hopes as a nation, and labouring in despised Galilee (according to Isaiah 8 and 9) in the gathering a remnant by faith.<a name=168:4></a> Even if it be chronologically exact, that it was at that moment He returned to Nazareth, as it well may be, still I should judge the object of the Spirit in Luke was not that exactitude, but the moral fact that He did accomplish legal requirements, but, that once done, took His place among the poor of the flock, far from Jerusalem.<a name=168:5></a> We find an analogous instance in what follows, in His coming up to Jerusalem at the passover, and being subject to Joseph and Mary, but, His true character coming out, though He was not yet to act upon it: He came to be a Nazarene; He came to be about His Father's business.<a name=168:6></a> Luke marks this distinctly before He enters on His public ministry, that it might be seen to be connected with His person, and not to depend merely upon His office.<a name=168:7></a> He was the Pastor of the poor of the flock in spirit and character.<a name=168:8></a> It belonged to Him.<a name=168:9></a> He was the Son of the Father, though He might abide God's time for shewing it.<a name=168:10></a> This is just as much according to the tenor of Luke's Gospel, as what Matthew recounts is in accordance with the tenor of his.<a name=168:11></a> Luke 2: 39 contains the whole moral history of the place the Lord took in Israel.<a name=168:12></a> Of course Mr.<a name=168:13></a> N.<a name=168:14></a> is insensible to these things, because the intention of God in the scriptures is, by the position he has taken, wholly unknown to him.<a name=168:15></a>

Thus, for instance, Esther. Is the providential care of Israel even during its rejection not a principle of immense importance in God's dealings with men and His people? It is of the very last importance. Is such a knowledge of God not ethical for me? He could not reveal Himself, or it would not be the time of their rejection.

		The Psalms notably shew the different use of the two terms, as does the Book of Jonah.<a name=181:1></a> I will take a special example from the Psalms to shew this -- Psalms 14 and 53.<a name=181:2></a> These are very nearly the same; but in one Jehovah is used, in the other Elohim.<a name=181:3></a> In Psalm 14 Jehovah is used.<a name=181:4></a> Hence it says, "They were in great fear, for [Elohim -- God Himself] GOD is in the generation of the righteous.<a name=181:5></a>" The relationship, the consequence of this name Jehovah, is expressed in the presence of Elohim with the righteous in verse 6.<a name=181:6></a> "Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because Jehovah is his refuge.<a name=181:7></a>" Now in Psalm 53 Elohim is used; it is the historical fact of what they were in the sight of Elohim.<a name=181:8></a> Hence we have, "There were they in great fear, where no fear was; for Elohim hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee; thou hast put them to shame, because Elohim hath despised them.<a name=181:9></a>" These psalms convey the same truths; but the thought of relationship prevails where Jehovah is used; whereas, where Elohim is used, we have the general result as regards the enemy.<a name=181:10></a><a href="#181:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>
	</div>
	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#181:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>It may be interesting to those who do study scripture with spiritual understanding, however feeble, to draw their attention to the circumstance, that all the psalms in the first Book (i.e., to the end of Psalm 41) are addressed to Jehovah, except Psalm 16, in which, as cited by Paul in proof of Christ's partaking of human nature, and by Peter as proof of His resurrection, Christ's taking His place with man is most clearly brought out. "Preserve me, O Elohim, for in thee [in what God was as such, He having become man] do I put my trust. Thou hast said to Jehovah, Thou art my Adon [Lord]; my goodness extendeth not to thee." (He takes the place of subjection, and that in Israel, not as equal with the Father. "Why callest thou me good? there is none good but *God*.") "[Thou hast said] to the saints that are in the earth, and the excellent, All my delight is in them." He takes His place now along with the saints, not with Jehovah: as to Him, He takes the place of a servant. How deep and admirable are the instructions of the word! Now all these psalms of Book I. suppose relationship existing (as, however deserving rejection and not a people, was the case in Israel when Jesus was amongst them). But in Psalm 53 (i.e., Book 2) it will be seen that they are cast out from God's sight -- can no more frequent His temple and worship. Hence we at once find not Jehovah, but Elohim addressed. And so it is through this Book; though, of course, He is owned to be Jehovah, and Jehovah as the only true Elohim. I have no doubt that, prophetically, Book 1 refers to the Jews in the latter day, returned to Jerusalem, and enjoying *outwardly* their hoped-for advantages there; and that Book 2 has its application when they are driven out in the time of the great tribulation mentioned in Matthew 24. It will be seen that Book 3 (beginning with Psalm 73) refers to all Israel (i.e., the ten tribes as well as the two) as such, and not specially the Jews, but only to the clean in heart, however, among them. They are still driven out -- the temple pillaged and defaced -- and Elohim is addressed, until the last confederacy in Psalm 83, where the judgment prophetically spoken of introduces Jehovah, known as Most High over all the earth. Then in Psalm 84 they address Jehovah, and turn and mount up to the tabernacles of Jehovah Sabaoth and His courts, finding that man blessed whose trust is in Jehovah. Thence onward is praise to Jehovah, with contrition and exercise of heart, mercy celebrated in the true, gracious, or holy One (*Chasidika*), Christ, the true David, which closes the Book. I may just add, that Book 4 celebrates in all its bearings, but in special connection with Israel, the introduction of the first-begotten into the world (Psalm go giving Jehovah's interest in Israel; Psalm 91, Christ's taking Jehovah the God of Israel as the true Elion Shaddai -- the names by which Melchizedek blessed Abraham), then celebrates Him in this character and develops the coming of the Lord to reign, and that in detail from the cry of the needy till He is fully again seated between the cherubim. In Book 5 from Psalm 101 we have the general bearings of it all, and the praises and hallelujahs which result from it -- a kind of historical comment upon all God's dealings with the world, Israel, the Messiah, and His place while all was going on. Already, in the last psalms of Book 4, Christ's government (that, while utterly brought low even to death, He was Jehovah) is brought out in the most astonishing way. The healing of the paralytic in Luke is a distinct allusion to Jehovah's name in Psalm 103: 3. But I must not go farther here on this subject.

		<a class="footnote" name="#182:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>I would just add here, that it is perfectly indifferent to me if Moses used five hundred documents, provided what he in result gives me expresses exactly, perfectly, and completely, what God meant to communicate to me. I have taken the case of Jonah, because we have the use of Jehovah and Elohim where there is no pretence for this flimsy notion of documents. I may add, that I never found a case in which the use of either of these words did not seem to me precisely appropriate; and this distinctive use is eminently instructive. In the Psalms this is peculiarly the case. This internal evidence of suitableness to relationship is the strongest possible kind of proof of the genuineness and (the subject being moral and divine) of the divine character of the record, in which this suitableness is uniformly found. Thus, not to speak of the Psalms, where it is shewn more in detail (see preceding note), the Book of Jonah touches on the relationship of Israel to Gentiles, of the peculiar God of Israel with Gentiles, of God as such with the latter, with creation, so as to put everything in its place -- without an idea of proving anything about it according to the whole history of the Bible from Genesis to the end of Chronicles. It shews the feeling of a Jew on one side, and God's way of looking at it on the other. The proper place of Jehovah, in His character of God of Israel, is always preserved; and yet it is shewn that this very Jehovah was the supreme God of goodness to men, let them be in the height of their pride, if there was room for repentance a character which He would not relinquish even towards cattle. Nothing can be more important as a key to the whole question of God being Jehovah, and the peculiar God of Israel, and yet the one supreme and universal God (a thought so easily lost, at any rate as to goodness, if not as to power, by Jewish pride). It corrects all that a Jew could draw falsely from his peculiar position.

		DEATH OF AARON
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards the difficulty arising from the passage in Deuteronomy<a href="#196:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> regarding Aaron's death, it is one of those passages which are the strongest possible proofs of not only the authenticity but the personal knowledge of the author, because there is apparent contradiction, which is immediately solved when you examine all the details -- a proof that it is written by one who knew them, and, having the consciousness of the links which united the parts, was not sensible of the necessity of making it hang together as a fabricated story.<a name=196:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is quite true that, in appearance, Deuteronomy 10 makes Aaron die <i>before reaching</i> Meribah-kadesh, where, according to Numbers, he sinned and incurred the penalty of death.<a name=196:2></a> Mr.<a name=196:3></a> N.<a name=196:4></a>'s proof is Numbers 33: 31-38.<a name=196:5></a> Moseroth being mentioned in verse 31 <i>before</i> Kadesh, where Moses sinned; Mosera, in Deuteronomy 10 as the place of Aaron's death, which would be thus before coming to Meribah, where he sinned; for in Deuteronomy 10 it is said he died at Mosera, consequently at Moseroth (Numbers 33: 31); but in this list of Numbers this Moseroth is before he came to Kadesh-barnea, where the sin was committed for which he was condemned to die in the wilderness.<a name=196:6></a> In one word, Mosera, where he died, Deuteronomy 10, is in Numbers 33: 31 before Kadesh, where he sinned.<a name=196:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, if we look at these accounts superficially (Mr.<a name=196:8></a> N.<a name=196:9></a> must forgive me if I employ the word he has consecrated to this use), this objection may seem plausible enough.<a name=196:10></a> But it is perfectly certain that Israel went from Moseroth to Ezion-gaber, back to Moseroth, and again back to Ezion-gaber, then to go round Edom.<a name=196:11></a> This circumstance, which clears up the whole matter, shews that the knowledge of the facts was of that personal kind which is not aware of the difficulty of one who is a stranger to them, because personal consciousness of the whole is a continual explanation of them.<a name=196:12></a> If the reader pays attention, the first two places mentioned in Deuteronomy are in inverse order to that in which they are named in Numbers.<a name=196:13></a> I may first remark that they continued in this neighbourhood thirty-seven years; so that many journeys might have been made; but there is something more precise than that.<a name=196:14></a> In Numbers 33 they go from Moseroth by Bene-jaakan, <i>Hor</i>-hagidgad, <i>to</i> Ezion-gaber.<a name=196:15></a> <i>From</i> Ezion-gaber they go back to <i>Hor</i>.<a name=196:16></a> (Numbers 21.<a name=196:17></a>) After Aaron's death they go from Mount Hor back to the Red Sea -- that is, to Ezion-gaber -- to compass the I and of Edom, and go up the <i>other side</i> of the mountain district.<a name=196:18></a> That is, we have one journey from Moseroth to Ezion-gaber, another back to Mount Hor, where Aaron died; and, as Numbers 21 shews, a journey from Mount Hor back to Ezion-gaber.<a name=196:19></a> At the end of the second of these journeys Aaron dies; that is, when they had gone back to Mount Hor.<a name=196:20></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first journey from Moseroth to Ezion-gaber was by Bene-jaakan or "the sons of Jaakan," Hor-hagidgad, and Jotbathah.<a name=197:4></a> The second journey was back from Ezion-gaber to the place where Aaron died.<a name=197:5></a> Now the journey in Deuteronomy is from the wells of the children of Jaakan to Mosera (that is, part of a journey <i>back along</i> the road they had come, at the end of which, in Mosera, Aaron dies); exactly as, in Numbers, we have seen them go back from Ezion-gaber to Hor where Aaron died, and thence set out again for Ezion-gaber.<a name=197:6></a>

Then, having compassed this mountain long enough (Deuteronomy 2: 1-3), Numbers 21: 4, they go back again to the Red sea, and then turn up to the other side of Edom. Deuteronomy 10: 6, 7, from Bene-jaakan to Moseroth, and back from Moseroth to Jotbathah see Numbers 33: 31, and then 32, 33; 31 is in the opposite direction to Deuteronomy 10: 6; 32, 33 is the same: Moseroth or Mosera being the turning point, and Bene-jaakan omitted in Deuteronomy 10: 7.

		<a class="footnote" name="#202:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>I may be allowed to extract from Eichhorn, a celebrated German rationalist, his judgment of this part of the argument. He wrote in the early part of this century, and does not believe in inspiration. I quote the translation given by Mr. Stuart. <p>1. "They do not arise from the forgery of any one individual. Whoever is endowed with adequate knowledge and investigates with impartiality the question -- whether the writings of the Old Testament are genuine -- must surely answer it in the affirmative. No *one* deceiver can have forged them all. This every page of the Old Testament proclaims. What a variety in language and expression! Isaiah does not write like Moses; nor Jeremiah like Ezekiel; and between these and every one of the minor prophets a great gulf is fixed. The grammatical edifice of language in Moses has much that is peculiar; in the book of Judges occur provincialisms and barbarisms. Isaiah pours forth words already formed in a new shape; Jeremiah and Ezekiel are full of Chaldaisms. In a word, when one proceeds from writers who are to be assigned to early periods of time to those who are later, he finds in the language a gradual decline, until at last it sinks down into mere Chaldaic terms of expression. <p>"Then come next the discrepancies in the circle of ideas and of images. The stringed instruments sound aloud when touched by Moses and Isaiah; soft is the tone when David handles them. Solomon's must shines forth in all the splendour of a most luxurious court; but her sister, in simple attire, wanders, with David, by the brooks and the river-banks, in the fields and among the herds. One poet is original, like Isaiah, Joel, Habakkuk; another copies, like Ezekiel. One roams in the untrodden path of genius; another glides along the way which his predecessors have trodden. From one issue rays of learning, whilst his neighbour has not been caught by one spark of literature. In the oldest writers strong Egyptian colours glimmer through and through; in their successors they become fainter and fainter, until at last they disappear. <p>"Finally, there is, in manners and customs, the finest gradation. At first all is simple and natural, like to what one sees in Homer, and among the Bedouin Arabs even at the present time; but this noble simplicity gradually loses itself in luxury and effeminacy, and vanishes at last in the splendid court of Solomon. <p>"Nowhere is there a sudden leap; everywhere the progress is gradual. None but ignorant and thoughtless doubters can suppose the Old Testament to have been forged by *one* deceiver. <p>2. "They are not the forgery of *many* deceivers. <p>" But, perhaps, some one may reply, 'Perhaps many forgers have made common cause, and, at the same time, in some later period, have got up the books in question.' But how could they forge in a way so entirely conformed to the progress of the human understanding? And was it possible, in later times, to create the language of Moses? This surpasses all human powers. Finally, one writer supposes the existence of another. They could not then all have arisen at the same time; they must have existed successively. <p>"' Perhaps, then,' it may be further said, 'such forgers arose at different times, who continued onward, in the introduction of supposititious writings, from the place where their deceitful predecessors had stopped. In this way may all the references to preceding writers be explained; in this way may we explain the striking gradation that exists in all its parts.'<p>"But, first, how was it possible that no one should have discovered the trick, exposed it, and put a brand upon the deceiver, in order that posterity might be secured against injury? How could a whole nation be often deceived, and at different periods? Secondly, what design could such a deceiver have had in view? Did he aim at eulogizing the Hebrew nation? Then are his eulogies the severest satires; for, according to the Old Testament, the Hebrew nation have acted a very degrading part. Or did he mean to degrade them? In this case, how could he force his books upon the very people whom they defamed, and the story of whose being trodden under foot by foreign nations is told in plain blunt words?"

		This has led Gesenius (rationalist enough not to be anxious to maintain any theory as to the Old Testament, and hence a better witness here) to say, "The point of time at which we should date the commencement of this period, and of Hebrew literature in general, is certainly as early as Moses, even if the Pentateuch did not proceed from him in its present form.<a name=203:1></a>" And then he refers to different forms in the Pentateuch as proving it.<a name=203:2></a>

The feast of Purins, ever observed by the Jews, is an irrefragable proof of the history of the book of Esther, which the Jews value as they do the Pentateuch, saying these two will subsist when all the other books pass away in the days of the Messiah.

And thus, like a dissected map, its completeness, the place of each part, the perfectness of each part in its place, is self-demonstrated for him who knows what the map is. Mr. Stuart might as well complain of the piece that contained Russia because it was not the map of Andover in Massachusetts, as reason as to the suitableness of Esther because it was not moral instruction for a Christian, or did not help a preacher to make a sermon.

		This is my answer to what Mr.<a name=225:1></a> N.<a name=225:2></a> says of Paul's reasoning like Gamaliel, and talking of subjects such as Philo reasons about.<a name=225:3></a><a href="#225:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> I have no doubt that glimmerings of needed truth were apprehended through the wants of the natural mind.<a name=225:4></a> The mind of man (through some traditional rays of light, affected by the creation through which it moved, by its conscience, by its sense of the want of something to meet a thousand questions which arose out of all this, and the heavings of an immortal soul within) felt that something was wanted to answer a craving, a void, which gave no clearness or certainty of what that answer would be.<a name=225:5></a> The revelation given in the Old Testament, the secondary effect of which was undoubtedly widely spread, furnished some clue to a large apprehension of the divine nature -- opened up enquiries to the mind which it did not satisfy either.<a name=225:6></a> These floated about in various forms, and may be resumed in the western world, in Plato and the Targums, or perhaps Philo.<a name=225:7></a> The revelation of God in the New Testament met all these by the perfect revelation of God Himself, in His own being, and in every relation in which He stood with creation.<a name=225:8></a> Hence, while it gave the whole positive truth as to God, it left no room for the inadequate or erroneous views current on the same subjects in various forms.<a name=225:9></a> It took all the elements of truth which floated in men's minds and systems -- <i>rari nantes in gurgite vasto</i> -- and connected them in their true place with the centre of all truth.<a name=225:10></a> Chaos became perfect order, and associated with the vast expanse of heaven, with which it took its true place and relationship; while it left no room for the pride of man to pretend to have stores of wonderful knowledge (for he is proud of everything he discovers himself); for all true knowledge was a matter of revelation, and who can boast of that?<a name=225:11></a> Hence we find the hazy notions of the Platos, Philos, and Targums, absorbed into perfect truth, and the gnostic reveries and pretensions anticipated and judged.<a name=225:12></a> We get the lovgo" with divine certainty and clearness, the plhvrwma in all its simple, divine, clearly defined truth and perfectness.<a name=225:13></a> We get the fw<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#6:225">footnote</a></i>" and ajlhvqeta, everything that man might indulge his imagination and his pride about, in the form of real truth.<a name=225:14></a> We get infinitely more knowledge, and certain, yea, divine knowledge, but no room for speculation; and (the perfection of the Godhead being revealed in Christ) all the development of ancient or modern gnostics is shut out by that all-important divine word -- "That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life.<a name=225:15></a> For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us.<a name=225:16></a>"

		FAITH AT SECOND HAND

		But it is well to remark some other points on which the chapter we are occupied with depends.<a name=227:1></a> Its title is, "Faith at second hand found to be vain.<a name=227:2></a>" Now the reader will observe that, though "second-hand faith" seems to be a very uncertain ground of confidence, the real meaning of the phrase is this, that there can be no faith at all except by a revelation made to the individual who receives it; and that it can never pass any farther.<a name=227:3></a> That is, that as regards the revelation of truth, or any revelation for men in general, none such can exist; for, if Peter or Paul have received a revelation, it is for me a revelation at second hand.<a name=227:4></a> That is, all revelation of truth must be a perpetual personal miracle, and exercise of God's power, without, consequently, any exercise of responsibility whatever in its reception.<a name=227:5></a> The scripture presents revelation as given, in order to be communicated for the good of others.<a name=227:6></a> Which is most rational (I go no farther here), if there is any real blessing -- to give a revelation so as to produce absolute divine certainty in the mind, with no possibility of communicating it so as to put man under the responsibility of receiving it, and thus, if a blessing, to require a renewed miracle to each person, -- or to communicate divine truth by a chosen instrument, with sufficient evidence to place men under responsibility of bowing to it when it is presented to them?<a name=227:7></a> But, further, Mr.<a name=227:8></a> N.<a name=227:9></a>'s reasonings on it are nothing whatever to the purpose.<a name=227:10></a> He requires to be informed how Paul got it.<a name=227:11></a> The question is not, What has been the means of assuring him?<a name=227:12></a> but, has he given adequate evidence of the truth he preaches, so as to bind me to receive it?<a name=227:13></a> It is evident that this last is the whole question with me.<a name=227:14></a> If any one has got possession of my father's will leaving me an immense fortune, the question is, not by what means he was convinced it was his, so as to keep it safe and communicate it to me; but whether I have, and can produce in court, adequate testimony that it is my father's, now it is in my possession.<a name=227:15></a> Mr.<a name=227:16></a> N.<a name=227:17></a>'s reasonings here are totally irrelevant.<a name=227:18></a> It is merely a denial of any revelation, and discrediting all by a point, difficult perhaps to solve for any of us whom God does not employ as instruments of communicating one, but perfectly irrelevant when the question is, Am I bound to receive it?<a name=227:19></a> If I prove my father's signature, and that of the witnesses, how the finder was convinced is all one to me.<a name=227:20></a>

		DIVINE TRUTH COMMUNICATED BY GOD. ADEQUATE PROOFS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The meaning of any one's having a divine revelation is very simple.<a name=228:1></a> It is divine truth directly communicated to him by God, with divine certainty, whatever the means of such communication (and they were various) may be.<a name=228:2></a> With Moses it was face to face; with prophets, a vision or dream; in the New Testament, often, evidently, the Holy Ghost acting on the intelligence; in certain cases, though the coming of the word of the Lord was certain in the Old, the full bearing was not understood at the time of revelation.<a name=228:3></a> This difference may have its interest to the believer.<a name=228:4></a> It is nothing to an unbeliever; with him the question is, With what evidence is the truth presented to him?<a name=228:5></a> To say that God cannot communicate His thoughts to man, giving certainty to the mind that it is Himself, is to say that He cannot do what man is perfectly capable of.<a name=228:6></a> To say that He cannot afford certainty when the truth is communicated to a third person, by adequate evidence accompanying it, is an absurdity worthy of an infidel only.<a name=228:7></a> But if he can, "faith at second hand" is not vain.<a name=228:8></a> It is founded, or may be so, on adequate proofs.<a name=228:9></a> Yet this is the proposition of the chapter.<a name=228:10></a> Whether there are such proofs is a question of fact which Mr.<a name=228:11></a> N.<a name=228:12></a> leaves aside to enquire how Paul received the revelation,<a href="#228:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> and knew it to be such, which has nothing whatever to say to the matter.<a name=228:13></a> Supposing prophecies clearly accomplished, and even finding a meaning by the event, while otherwise inexplicable: -- supposing, in him who is the subject of revelation, a perfection of individual walk wholly without parallel, the invention of which, even as a tale, would have been a greater miracle, man being what he is, than its existence, if a divine Person was really there: -- supposing this person, after accomplishing prophecies and working notorious miracles, publicly and undeniably over the whole country, promises to communicate, when gone, to others who had it not, a power more conspicuous than that exercised by Himself -- that a doctrine and practice, entirely beyond their age and country, characterize these persons, their whole tone and conduct being founded on the communication they impart, and that they perform publicly, in view of their enemies, notable miracles, which there is no gainsaying -- that with a few words these men, once ignorant, confound all their adversaries, not by contentious learning, but by the power which, in the plainest terms, guides and fills their speech -- that the promise of power from Him gone away is thus demonstrably fulfilled -- that ignorant fishermen, whose provincialisms betrayed their country, now suddenly speak many tongues, so that men brought up in each understood them: -- supposing all this true, should I not have proof that the testimony about this admirable and unequalled Being was true?<a name=228:14></a> That is, I should have proof, moral, prophetic, miraculous, in my conscience, my understanding, that their testimony was divine -- that it was a revelation, though many historic points otherwise cognizable might confirm it; for I suppose the thing not done in a corner.<a name=228:15></a> In what manner this wonderful Being, now absent, has communicated to them what they preach about Him, does not touch the question whether I am bound to receive it.<a name=228:16></a> That depends on the evidence offered to me, not on that afforded to them.<a name=228:17></a> Now, it may be said, "You are supposing all this.<a name=228:18></a>" I am: because the question is not whether Christianity is true, but whether, as a general proposition, faith at second hand is vain; that is, whether a denial of all revelation to man, as being an impossibility, can be reasonably maintained.<a name=228:19></a> Secondhand faith is the best and highest kind.<a name=228:20></a> It has an amazingly higher moral character, and so the Lord assures us in the case of Thomas, John 20.<a name=228:21></a>

Paul did see a sight -- did hear a sound -- and tells us he did receive things from the Lord, which I suppose produced impressions. But leaving this, which was the ground of his faith properly speaking (and unless I had an equally strong impression on my mind with himself, it would be impossible for me to know how he discerned its divine character, and then I should not want his reception of it at all) -- leaving this entirely illogical and irrational ground taken by Mr. N., I would ask, what he means by -- "Until these questions are fully answered we have no materials before us for deciding?" Suppose Paul had opened my eyes, I having been born blind, or any one else's, and had so reached my conscience that I could say, Here is a man who has told me all that ever I did, and shewn me a God that indeed searches the heart and tries the reins, and yet is perfect love -- should I have no materials for judging whether he taught the truth and was sent of God -- supposing too, in all his life he approved himself as a minister of God -- until I knew, to satisfy my curiosity, how he had got it?

	<div class="paragraph">
		Some historical objections remain to be noticed.<a name=231:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, the well-known one of the conquest of Canaan.<a name=231:2></a> That, in the public government of the world, men have dealt thus and worse with conquered people, is certain; so that what Mr.<a name=231:3></a> N.<a name=231:4></a> considers as man <i>as God made him</i> has so acted -- and God's government has so ordered it.<a name=231:5></a> This is Mr.<a name=231:6></a> N.<a name=231:7></a>'s notion.<a name=231:8></a> The fact of similar conquests is notorious in history.<a name=231:9></a> The only difference between Mr.<a name=231:10></a> N.<a name=231:11></a> and me is, that I hold, though such inroads may be used for judgment, as is shewn in Habakkuk, Joel, and frequently in the prophets (the book of Job explaining, so to speak, the secret springs of all this), yet that it is the <i>sin of man</i> which has given such a character to the government of God.<a name=231:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in Israel's history God did not go out of this character of government.<a name=231:13></a> He merely took a nation in which He shewed its direct operation and the motives of it, so that that government should be learned by a law.<a name=231:14></a> So that man should say, "Verily there is a reward for the righteous, verily there is a God that <i>judgeth in the earth</i>.<a name=231:15></a>" Israel, therefore, is put in relationship with God as a nation, and national laws given to them.<a name=231:16></a> As a whole, the law given to them was not a code of everlasting righteousness with a fully revealed God.<a name=231:17></a> Christ declares even the contrary.<a name=231:18></a> God was hidden behind the veil, and <i>said</i> that He would dwell in the thick darkness.<a name=231:19></a> Hence those who walked really with God suffered in Israel, as now in the world -- a riddle too hard for them till in the sanctuary they learned the way of God in judgment.<a name=231:20></a> Grace, though secretly working and shewn in daily mercy, was unrevealed.<a name=231:21></a> Judgment and government were the principles on which God dealt, though patient goodness marked this government.<a name=231:22></a> The basis of it is laid in Exodus 34: 6 9; 32: 33.<a name=231:23></a> No doubt individuals saw beyond this to eternal things, as the Abrahams, the Davids, and a crowd of holy men in whom real faith was.<a name=231:24></a> But the principle brought out in God's dealing with the nation was God judging in the earth.<a name=231:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This it is that has produced confusion in the minds of many with such a book as Warburton's "Divine Legation of Moses".<a name=231:26></a> They could not but feel that they are not to be heard who feign that the fathers did look for mere transitory promises; while, on the other hand, the argument of Bishop Warburton's book is, in the main idea, incontestable.<a name=231:27></a> But all is simple if we see that the earthly government, carried on under Moses, did find its public sanction in present earthly judgments, while individual saints (suffering under the sin of others, and even plunged in deep sorrow because God's people were under judgment for their sins, and the public glory of God and His worship cast down through it) still looked, by present personal piety in which their hearts were elevated to God, beyond it all, and became more heavenly by this very means and the non-accomplishment of earthly promises.<a name=231:28></a> At the same time the great principles of everlasting righteousness were interspersed through the national enactments of the law, so that they who had hearts to perceive them should learn and be imbued with them; and they are brought out as such by the divine and perfect wisdom of the Saviour, while faith, as to the nation as the vessel of promise, was sustained by the assurance of the coming of a Messiah, who, executing judgment against every oppressor and bringing in everlasting righteousness, would also accomplish, in grace on God's part, the hopes of faith and the infallible promises of God in favour of the residue of the people whom He had called.<a name=231:29></a> This is entirely to come: for now God is calling the Church exclusively to a heavenly place, "blessed with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ," that the purpose of God for the administration of the fulness of times might be accomplished, that is, to gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and on earth, Ephesians 1: 8-10.<a name=231:30></a>

		Now what Daniel spoke of in chapter 7, as arriving at this epoch of divine judgment, when the saints would have the kingdom (namely, that the Son of man would come in glory), the Lord also expressly declares; referring, in a positive and most remarkable manner, to another prophecy of Daniel, relating to the same epoch, and unfolding the special tribulation of which He spoke, and His coming in glory, which would be consequent on it.<a name=252:1></a> Every statement of scripture, in various parts of it, and by different prophets, concurs in this, and concurs in placing these events in the grand closing scene of God's government <i>of the earth</i>, viewed as the scene of man's national responsibility, Israel being the centre, in God's view of it (see Deuteronomy 32: 8), of all this government.<a name=252:2></a> The Lord (or Matthew, if Mr.<a name=252:3></a> N.<a name=252:4></a> pleases), so far from confounding anything, gives warnings for the conduct of the disciples in their testimony in the midst of Israel, while that testimony should be carried on there; adding that the testimony of <i>the kingdom</i> should go out to all nations, and that then (not before) the end of the age (not of the world, as every scholar knows) should come.<a name=252:5></a> Then, with verse 14, He closes His general history and directions.<a name=252:6></a> This is beyond controversy; because the question of the disciples was as to the end of the age; and He says (verse 14), "Then shall the end come.<a name=252:7></a>" Then He takes up a very particular point, which He definitely connects with Daniel's prophecy of what was to happen at this "end of the age" (that is, that at that epoch, or twelve hundred and sixty days before the end, it would not be a time of testimony, but that they were to see).<a name=252:8></a> The sign would be an idol set up in the holy place, which idol was to cause the desolation of Jerusalem.<a name=252:9></a> Now this has never yet taken place at all.<a name=252:10></a> Titus did destroy Jerusalem, but no idol was set up in the holy place, which caused the desolation.<a name=252:11></a> Michael, the prince, did not stand up for Daniel's people -- and to this the New Testament writer refers; nor was any deliverance of Jacob wrought, nor did Daniel stand in his lot, nor did the sign of the Son of man appear, nor did thirteen-hundred-and-thirty days bring any blessing.<a name=252:12></a> That is, to the believer there certainly was not the accomplishment of the prophecy.<a name=252:13></a> But what is the conclusion we must draw?<a name=252:14></a> No person writing, as Mr.<a name=252:15></a> N.<a name=252:16></a> supposes, after the event, would have written an account, of which the contradiction and falseness was in the hands of all, and of public notoriety.<a name=252:17></a> He could not pretend that the Son of man had appeared, and that the elect Jews were gathered -- that the blessing of Daniel was arrived.<a name=252:18></a> If he lived after the event he might have given a flaming description of Titus's siege, which history would have furnished him with; but at this point it becomes (to use Mr.<a name=252:19></a> N.<a name=252:20></a>'s phrase) "clearly and hopelessly false" in Mr.<a name=252:21></a> N.<a name=252:22></a>'s application of it.<a name=252:23></a> That is, it certainly was not written after the event.<a name=252:24></a> No man would write, in forging a prophecy, what was already clearly and hopelessly false at the time he wrote it.<a name=252:25></a> For, as Mr.<a name=252:26></a> N.<a name=252:27></a> justly insists (by putting it in italics), it is stated that "<i>immediately after</i> that tribulation," etc.<a name=252:28></a> So that nothing but the utter nonsense of infidel credulous invention could have explained Matthew 24 as Mr.<a name=252:29></a> N.<a name=252:30></a> does.<a name=252:31></a> That infidels should be ignorant of the abundant confirmation given in the prophets of the real force of the passage, was only to be expected.<a name=252:32></a> They have never really examined the contents of the book.<a name=252:33></a> They are not capable, by their position, of getting beyond literary speculations.<a name=252:34></a> Perhaps we must also expect from them that they should seek to persuade us that a rational account of the passage is, that the writer composed, to deceive them, an account of what was happening among themselves, which was notoriously false at the time he wrote it, to gain the credit of a true prophet for his master!<a name=252:35></a>

This (seventy or eighty) would leave, at all events, several years¬ margin for the *immediately after*. The taking of Jerusalem was A.D. 70. If the reader asks what authority there is for this date of Matthew's gospel, the reply is, There is none: but universal testimony to the contrary. Matthew is quoted by Barnabas just after the siege of Jerusalem. But we must not expect any authority for sceptical statements. I opened Parker's "De Wette," to see why he rejected Daniel.

		This paragraph of Mr.<a name=268:1></a> N.<a name=268:2></a>'s has puzzled me a little: "Next, as to the prophecies of the Pentateuch, they abound, as to the times which precede the century of Hezekiah; higher than which we cannot trace the Pentateuch.<a name=268:3></a>" (Phases, page 171.<a name=268:4></a>) He adds, in a note, "The first apparent reference is by Micah 6: 5, a contemporary of Hezekiah.<a name=268:5></a>" The object of this is obvious: it is to prove that they were composed just then, and gave out history for prophecy.<a name=268:6></a> That is plain enough -- a very strange thing to urge, when they were most certainly, as he tells us elsewhere, compiled and published in Josiah's days, and never before.<a name=268:7></a> "As I considered the narrative, my eyes were opened.<a name=268:8></a> If the book had previously been the received sacred law, it could not possibly have been so lost that its contents were unknown, and the fact of its loss forgotten.<a name=268:9></a> It was, therefore, evidently <i>then first compiled</i>, or, at least, then first produced and made authoritative to the nation.<a name=268:10></a>" (Phases, page 137.<a name=268:11></a>) But the former was a discovery.<a name=268:12></a> His eyes were opened.<a name=268:13></a> But I pass from this now: it lasted thirty-three pages; and that is something for a German discovery -- provided, that is, that it suffices to raise a doubt.<a name=268:14></a> But now why this singularly vague expression -- "as to the times which precede the century of Hezekiah?<a name=268:15></a>" They contained accurate accounts, it is to be supposed, as to the times preceding his century.<a name=268:16></a> Now we have found from De Wette that these books existed, and were referred to as well-known public documents nearly seventy years before Hezekiah's accession, about eighty years before his sickness in the middle of his reign.<a name=268:17></a> Now where are we to begin "Hezekiah's century?<a name=268:18></a>" If we set fifty years before and fifty years after him for his century, then we have prophecies existing twenty or thirty years before it, and so clear that Mr.<a name=268:19></a> N.<a name=268:20></a> takes them for histories.<a name=268:21></a> If we take B.<a name=268:22></a> C.<a name=268:23></a> 800 to B.<a name=268:24></a> C.<a name=268:25></a> 700 as Hezekiah's century, we have according to De Wette and Parker, prophecies proving the Pentateuch to be well-known public books, appealed to by prophets in Judah and Israel in the first ten years of his century; and Joel, whom De Wette does not mention, but in whose prophecy the reference is equally dear, proving their existence before Hezekiah's century some thirty years, perhaps many more.<a name=268:26></a> That is, the Pentateuch, according to Mr.<a name=268:27></a> N.<a name=268:28></a>, is full of prophecies as to the times in which it is proved to be publicly referred to as a well-known authentic book already in existence.<a name=268:29></a> What does this prove?<a name=268:30></a> And why all this vagueness as to times in Mr.<a name=268:31></a> N.<a name=268:32></a>?<a name=268:33></a> Why this omission of the testimony of the book he recommends, in which passages are given as a certain proof that the Pentateuch existed long before Hezekiah's reign, Micah alone being referred to by Mr.<a name=268:34></a> N.<a name=268:35></a> -- a book, too, as infidel as Mr.<a name=268:36></a> N.<a name=268:37></a> could wish -- nay, which is his grand armoury?<a name=268:38></a>

		THIS OLD TESTAMENT A CONTINUOUS HISTORY
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But if the Old Testament be attentively examined, we shall soon see that it is a continuous history, whoever was the means of making it so (God, as its divine Author, I doubt not), with moral and prophetic addresses joined to it, beginning with the creation and ending with the re-building of the temple and city, after their destruction by Nebuchadnezzar; not setting aside, however, the Gentile dominion, which had taken the place of God's throne in David's family in Jerusalem -- a dominion which will continue till Christ takes His, and that at Jerusalem again, as David's son.<a name=269:14></a> But this continuous history is in each successive book carried on, with just so much reference to the previous parts, and especially to the Pentateuch, the foundation of all, as was real and true in the state of the time they refer to; the last verse of Malachi throwing back (while announcing the coming of the great day of the Lord) the thoughts of the hearer to the days of Horeb and of the law.<a name=269:15></a> In first Samuel we have seven references to the Pentateuch, one to Joshua; in the second, two.<a name=269:16></a> That the law was forgotten in practice is most certain.<a name=269:17></a> But the whole of the Old Testament has the character of a successive history stamped on it in the very plainest possible way.<a name=269:18></a> This is its clear, natural, intrinsic character.<a name=269:19></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#270:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>Here we have slipped on from the times before Hezekiah's century to Hezekiah's day; that is, a margin of about a century is left. We have the Pentateuch cited 830, or at any rate 800, years before Christ, according to De Wette. Hezekiah's accession was, say, B.C. 725. Now suppose a prophecy in the Pentateuch was fulfilled in 750 before Christ, it was twenty-five years before Hezekiah's day, and yet fifty years after the prophecy was certainly in existence. Hence it was better to leave the date as vague as possible. The consequence is, Mr. N.'s statement proves nothing -- a hundred years is rather a long epoch to leave out and pass *sub silentio*, in order to escape the necessity of proving one's point We have Hezekiah's day bold enough in Phases, page 172; the times which precede his century (ib. page 171), as if it were the same thing; and in the note (ib. page 171), the first reference to the Pentateuch is in Micah, his contemporary (leaving out Joel, Amos, and Hosea, preceding prophets by whom it is quoted), and that makes a bridge from the times preceding his century to his day. Had I not looked into De Wette, who proves in due form that the Pentateuch, as we have it, is cited "in the times preceding Hezekiah's century," I could never have discovered what this singular phrase was worth; or why Hezekiah's name was introduced for dating quite a different epoch from his own. But then it glides, with Micah's help, much easier into "Hezekiah's day" in Phases, page 172. <p>I take the opportunity of this note to insert a statement from Lightfoot, in reference to the period at which the Magi came up, the sheet to which it properly belongs being already printed off. He supposes, as I have done, that the Magi came up some time after the birth of Christ, making the interval at least a year. <p>"Since, therefore, only fourteen years passed from the nativity of Christ to the death of Augustus, etc., we must reckon that Christ was not born but in the last years of Herod. Thus we conjecture: <p>"In his thirty-fifth, Christ was born. <p>"In his thirty-seventh, now newly begun, the wise men came: presently after this, was the slaying of the infants -- and after a few months, the death of Herod."

		We now come to the Gospels.<a name=271:3></a> In the first place, though there is a remarkable similarity of spirit and doctrine in the gospel and epistles of John, they are very easily distinguished by any attentive reader.<a name=271:4></a> The presenting of the person in the way of historical fact in the one, and the deduction of the nature of God, Christ, and the new man, from that manifestation in the other, are respectively the characters of the gospel and epistles.<a name=271:5></a> This renders the epistles much more abstract; and hence the connection of the reasoning is known only where the inward thread of divine life, which links it, is known; whereas Christ in the gospel is clearly and definitely presented, though the divine glory of His person is brought out.<a name=271:6></a>

		Such assertions have this immense difficulty standing in the way: -- that it is a "splendid testimony" on subjects which Alexandrian philosophers have essayed to teach -- that this testimony contains the holiest and truest teaching on man's real condition, and what he needed -- the profoundest knowledge and application of the Old Testament, and the connection between the universal principles it contains and the particular application in which a Jewish doctor ought to have understood them -- and yet the clear distinction as to how, in their universality as applied by God in grace, they would reach to all (besides the positive revelation of what introduced the heavenly development of the character to which these general spiritual principles lead), and that connected with what we know to be historically true, and prophetically announced, though contrary to all Jewish thoughts, and in its actual form only discoverable in prophecy by the key which the person of Christ gave to it -- yet, with that key, as simple as possible.<a name=273:1></a> All this, and much more than this, in the compass of a few verses (and such is John 3), we are told, is the invention of an impostor, and quite certainly such.<a name=273:2></a> It is a pity Mr.<a name=273:3></a> N.<a name=273:4></a> does not tell us why.<a name=273:5></a> If imposture be such, and so true, and has such a stamp of divine knowledge on it, what is truth?<a name=273:6></a> And what must the original living witness and exhibition of this truth have been?<a name=273:7></a> And besides, however profound, nothing can be simpler.<a name=273:8></a> There is nothing obscure and mythically mysterious about it.<a name=273:9></a>

		SPECIAL VIEWS OF CHRIST'S PERSON

	<div class="paragraph">
		It may be well here to say a few words on the manner in which the discourses of the Lord would be given to us, assuming the Holy Ghost to record them.<a name=273:10></a> For it is the character which would result, not the proof of the fact by evidence, that I now seek.<a name=273:11></a> First, it is perfectly certain, that we have a very small portion indeed of the discourses of Jesus.<a name=273:12></a> The Holy Ghost would give us those which divine wisdom considered permanently useful to the Church in all ages -- that which brought out great principles and abiding doctrines; and such is in fact the case.<a name=273:13></a> Take the sermon on the Mount, Matthew 13 Luke 15, 16, and the discourses in John, and the like: all bring out some special view of Christ's person, God's ways with men, or the principles of His rule as Father.<a name=273:14></a> Even in the same discourse He would give us, according to the connection in which it was recorded, that part which applies to the subject treated.<a name=273:15></a> Thus, supposing it had been said, "They killed at Jerusalem the Son whom the Father had sent," I might say, if the guilt of favoured Jerusalem was in question, "They killed the Son at Jerusalem;" if the mere extent of their guilt in respect of the dignity of His person, "They killed the Son.<a name=273:16></a>" If I sought to shew the slight of the Father and the contempt of His love, I might say, "They killed the Son whom the Father had sent.<a name=273:17></a>" And all these representations would be perfectly true; and in the pursuit of an object, such as God must have in recording these things, my leaving out a part which did not immediately bear on the purpose of God in the revelation would only give a truer force to the words -- more of the sense and meaning, according to the mind and teaching of God.<a name=273:18></a> Now each gospel might give only one of these (much more pertinent and instructive, but) incomplete citations; and hence there would be a difference.<a name=273:19></a> But so far from there being an inconsistency, there would be a great help to understanding the mind of God in the word.<a name=273:20></a>

		CHARACTERISTICS OF JOHN'S TESTIMONY
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this unfolding of particular testimony to Sonship, in contrast with the blinding of the Jews, is John's subject all through.<a name=277:9></a> Matthew's, as we have seen, is different; as is Luke's, who gives us the Son of man, and what is suited to the display of that truth.<a name=277:10></a> But there is such total and profound ignorance in all these infidel writers of the purpose of the author, that they do not understand the scope of a single passage.<a name=277:11></a> How should they?<a name=277:12></a> It is as if some wise housemaid should clean out a powerful voltaic battery, because dirty wire and plates and useless water were in it.<a name=277:13></a>

		And I beg the reader to call to mind, that if God was writing a book, He must have such objects.<a name=277:14></a> Adequate evidence of the facts proving His mission in Israel among the Jews was given in Matthew's Gospel among themselves, and I suppose (it is hardly to be doubted from the evidence we have) in their own tongue as well as in Greek, before the destruction of Jerusalem.<a name=277:15></a> John was employed (when Christianity was now, in one sense, established, and no longer in the cradle of Judaism) to give the great leading truths concerning the person and glory of Jesus, and the presence of the Holy Ghost needed for its building up and consolidation, and the guarding it against the inroads of heretical pravity.<a name=277:16></a> Could anything be more suitable, more timely, or more gracious on God's part?<a name=277:17></a> He preserves also an apostle himself, that, as external proof, we might have an eye-witness, and one most especially intimate with Jesus -- one we may reverently call His bosom friend -- to shew what really was the true doctrine of Christ when there was danger of departure from it, and need of building up in it; when it was no longer sufficient to believe that Jesus was the Christ in order to be preserved from the machinations of the enemy.<a name=277:18></a> And this is what we have in John.<a name=277:19></a> He is occupied entirely about the person of Christ, and the testimony of the Holy Ghost operating in the saints, whether to convict the world by, or to build up the Church in, the glory of that Christ.<a name=277:20></a> Meanwhile, if God chose fitting instruments, the Holy Ghost Himself, as Christ had promised, was the Author and Inspirer of all, whether in Matthew or in John, or any other.<a name=277:21></a> Now John was just the person fitted for this.<a name=277:22></a> The time was the time it was required, the thing done exactly what was called for: just as the general course of Christ's working was recorded by Matthew; but in Matthew, hundreds of miracles in a verse or two, to introduce the true character of the kingdom of heaven, which was his subject (all his detailed miracles bearing on his subject, as the few John relates do on his; and Luke's in an equally remarkable manner on his -- the healing, cleansing, forgiving, and quickening of man lost in sin).<a name=277:23></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He, whether through delusion or imposture, encouraged others in the thought that they had these tongues, and only boasted of having more "extravagances" than they, and of course different kinds of extravagances; for he spake several tongues -- a thing hard to conceive, that he should speak <i>several kinds</i> of jargon as if they were languages, and yet remain an honest man.<a name=281:22></a> Did he mistake his own diversified extravagances for miracles?<a name=281:23></a> It is very credible for a sceptic, but for no one else, I should think.<a name=281:24></a> If it comes under the class of logic or philosophy, I know not; but it certainly seems an "extravagance" to a plain mind that a man should speak a number of tongues which were no tongues at all, and never find out he was deceiving himself, nor think of deceiving others; but appeal to others who indulged in like extravagances, and without smiling, like Cicero's augurs, when they met each other.<a name=281:25></a> I have known some who held that Paul's tongues were; simply languages that he had learnt and was thankful to use.<a name=281:26></a> Mr.<a name=281:27></a> N.<a name=281:28></a> treats this notion as cheaply as it deserves, by not noticing it, and distinctly declaring the tongues to be an extravagance; whereas it is clear enough there is no extravagance at all in speaking a language we know to those whose language it is.<a name=281:29></a> Nothing more wise or simple.<a name=281:30></a> I say as cheaply as it deserves; because to suppose that people's speaking a language they had learnt at school was a proof that the Holy Ghost had come upon them, is really not worthy of consideration.<a name=281:31></a> And not only on the day of Pentecost, but at Samaria, and at the reception of Cornelius, the speaking of tongues is advanced in a very specific and distinct way as a proof of the descent of the Holy Ghost, and in the last case as a warrant for receiving the Gentiles into the Church of God (God having given them the like gift as to the apostles).<a name=281:32></a> Now, that a man's speaking a tongue he had learnt in an ordinary way should be a warrant for so doing, is too absurd an idea to entertain for a moment.<a name=281:33></a> No: they were extravagances or a miracle.<a name=281:34></a>

		PAUL'S PREACHING OF A GLORIFIED CHRIST, PETER'S WITNESSING
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next point noticed is St.<a name=286:1></a> Paul's preaching a glorified Christ, not a lowly One.<a name=286:2></a> It is quite true: and equally true that he was not called to be a witness of Christ's oral teachings.<a name=286:3></a> So it is declared in his mission as distinguished from that of the twelve.<a name=286:4></a> He was to be the great witness of that part of truth which put Jew and Gentile on the same footing in a heavenly way, which could only be in connection with a glorified Christ.<a name=286:5></a> But if that be supposed to mean, that he attached no importance to the history of Christ's humiliation,<a href="#286:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> nothing can be more false; only he takes it up, as he does all else, as a part of the vast counsels and plans and purposes of God.<a name=286:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The following passages, not to speak of unnumbered ones which speak of the cross, will prove what I say.<a name=286:7></a> In John 15: 26, 27, it is said, "But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me: and ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.<a name=286:8></a>" They were eye-witnesses of His life down here.<a name=286:9></a> As to Paul's ministry, it is said, Acts 26: 16, "But rise and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee.<a name=286:10></a>" Here we have the two commissions clearly stated.<a name=286:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So Peter calls himself a witness of Christ's sufferings, and a partaker of the glory to be revealed.<a name=286:12></a> Paul not only speaks of "the gospel of the glory," but says, "for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus" his Lord; and, instead of speaking of himself as a witness of the sufferings and partaker of the glory, seeks "the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings.<a name=286:13></a>" He descends, so to speak, into the sufferings, because of the glory, and as the way to his high calling above He does not speak of waiting for its revelation.<a name=286:14></a> And this was so very distinct, that Peter proposes, in Acts 3, to the Jews repentance, that Christ may return to them; Paul never.<a name=286:15></a> Peter's testimony had been rejected, and Stephen killed and received on high; and there was no thought then but receiving Jew and Gentile through the ministry of him whom grace had called away from Stephen's martyr-ground, and from the apostleship of Jewish hatred, to Christ, to be the witness of heavenly things connected with that glorious Christ, by the vision of whom on the way to Damascus he was arrested, and his pride laid low.<a name=286:16></a> The Holy Ghost also opened his spiritual eye on the Lord, leading him to preach Him whom once he destroyed.<a name=286:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#286:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>"Paul shews total unconcern to the human history and earthly teaching of Jesus ... .

		Hence he boldly declares, after speaking of the "gospel of the glory," that he does not know Christ in the former or Jewish way, after the flesh; and that if any man was in Christ, there was a new creation -- he belonged to what took him out of Jew and Gentile; as it had been said to him by Christ, when He appeared to him by the way, "Delivering thee from the Gentiles, to whom now I send thee.<a name=287:1></a>" But this only fills up.<a name=287:2></a> the perfectness of the gospel revelation in its place.<a name=287:3></a> And the humiliation of Christ takes, in Paul's view, all its immense and vast importance in the counsels of God, and is not a mere personal history, perfectly interesting and divinely instructive as that is in its place; for the gospel has a thousand aspects in one divine truth.<a name=287:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul was eminently the vessel of the counsels of God in Christ.<a name=287:5></a> Does that make the personal history of Jesus less interesting, less profoundly, divinely, though humanly, instructive?<a name=287:6></a> No; the heart goes back to study in every detail, One who in every detail was divine love and holiness, near enough to man's eye to study it for himself.<a name=287:7></a> But how does Paul speak of this?<a name=287:8></a> See the sweep of truth with which he brings Christ's humiliation in: "Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?<a name=287:9></a> He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.<a name=287:10></a>" What a place does His humiliation fill here!<a name=287:11></a> Again, take His, so to speak, official exaltation: "Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.<a name=287:12></a> Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow.<a name=287:13></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus the history of Christ's humiliation was looked at by Paul, through the Holy Ghost, not in the touching detail of Christ's individual life, of which he was not witness, but as one immense fact, and a cardinal one, in the vast scheme of God.<a name=287:14></a> This was exactly in its place, and in keeping with the service for which he was employed.<a name=287:15></a> John gives us the divine nature; Paul, the divine counsels; Peter, the walk of him who has a lively hope through the resurrection of One whose walk he had known and followed in its bright display on earth, towards the heaven into which resurrection is meant to introduce us (all founding the accomplishment of blessing on the redemption which He has wrought out for us).<a name=287:16></a>

		But this was not all the evidence Paul had, nor all he refers to.<a name=291:1></a> A godly, sober man, well reported of by his enemies and the truth's, but whom he did not know, comes to him unsent for, and declares to him that he has had a vision, and that he has been sent to him by the same Jesus who had appeared to him by the way; and not only this, but that he had been sent to give him back his sight, which accordingly took place, and moreover that he should receive the Holy Ghost.<a name=291:2></a> Accordingly we find Saul, previously astounded by the vision, and the immense revolution it must have produced in his mind to find he was fighting against the Lord of glory, and that all the heads of his religion were the bitter enemies of the glorious Christ of the God they professed to serve -- we find him, I say, boldly, with great force and conviction, proving that the Jesus whose disciples he persecuted was indeed the Christ, and soon naturally becoming himself the object of persecution, but persevering to the end.<a name=291:3></a>

		The rationalists, having not the least idea of God's thoughts and plan in scripture, never of course can weigh the bearing of its parts in reference to it.<a name=293:16></a> Hence their comments are the most childish things imaginable.<a name=293:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Their system -- "our logic" -- is this: They first settle that there can be no prophecy nor miracle.<a name=293:18></a> Consequently, when certain facts are prophetically stated, it is an evident and necessarily conclusive proof that the book containing them was written after the event referred to.<a name=293:19></a> Then they discuss all the possible events alluded to, and each has his notion, so that you are in a sea of conjectures.<a name=293:20></a> Divers documents are discovered; good Hebrew and bad Hebrew -- at any rate contradictory Hebrew is set in movement to settle the dates; and Jewish malice against the Gentiles, and every other notion imaginable, is referred to, to explain what Hezekiah's or somebody else's prophets mean.<a name=293:21></a> The false prophets were as good as their neighbours; only, not supporting the Levitical priesthood, they went to the wall.<a name=293:22></a> In my judgment, it is impossible to conceive anything more puerile.<a name=293:23></a>

It appears that, in the Talmudist's age, Jeremiah had this place; sundry reasons are given for its being there, as on account of kings ending in sorrow, and Jeremiah taking his sorrow up, while the Talmudists say Isaiah was put after the historical prophets Jeremiah and Ezekiel in order to comfort the reader, etc. I am aware Stuart and others say this was only so in the Talmudist's age, not so early as Christ. Gesenius argues that it was much earlier the case, and states that Jeremiah and Ezekiel come before Isaiah in the German and French MSS; after in the Spanish. I do not pretend to decide this question; but the expression, "Jeremiah or one of the prophets," certainly tends very strongly to confirm the idea that it was so in Christ's age.

It is clear, if it is a prophecy of Israel's portion at the end of time, after Christ's rejection it is all one whether it is written in Hezekiah's time, or at some other moment. Having assumed that it is not, the rationalist seeks about to find some time when an impostor was likely to have spoken in this way, and to try to deceive the people with similar hopes -- a notable employment for time and learning. and a convenient kind of logic, which assumes, without a blush, what the whole argument depends upon.

		From P -- one wrote to the "Irish Clergyman," "I do not see that we can fairly charge with Arianism one who is willing to confess that Jesus is Jehovah of hosts, and that He is to be honoured even as they honour the Father, though I cannot help feeling afraid lest the doctrine of His Sonship, as the Word, should not be sufficiently checked by such texts as Philippians, and, 'before Abraham was, I am.<a name=318:1></a>'" He was thus received, and thus himself speaks in a letter addressed to the "Irish Clergyman," of those whose bigotry he now exclaims against: -- "In truth, no one knows what we have lost in our various church systems, till he tastes the sweetness of the love of God, and savour of Christ, shed forth in a company of believers, professedly united as such.<a name=318:2></a> I greatly bless and thank God for bringing me hither, though for a little time, to receive and impart the consolations of Christ; and never have I been more drawn out into continual supplications than that the Lord will keep them meek, humble, and loving, as now.<a name=318:3></a> I am so struck with the contrast between the congregation here, and that at B -- ," etc.<a name=318:4></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#319:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>The reader may see the immediate consequence in Mr. N.'s mind, in page 93 of his book. "If Christ was one person, all Christ died. Did God then die, and man remain alive? For God to become non-existent is an unimaginable absurdity ... . At length I unawares dropped from semi-Arianism into pure Arianism by so distinguishing the Son from the Father, as to admit the idea that the Son of God had actually been non-existent in the interval between death and resurrection." Mark that Mr. N. had already taken this ground in his correspondence with those who had received him at P -- -- -, as may be seen in the extracts in the text; and what comes of his admission (I suppose as an intellectual dogma) that He was Jehovah? <p>Mark, too, that this notion affects the existence of the soul -- our soul, as well as the divinity of Christ. Certainly the difficulties of the "Irish Clergyman" and those of others, were not without foundation. He was telling them he believed Christ was Jehovah, yet at the very time held that about Him which, he now admits, involved His absolute non-existence at death, yet justified it by patristic formulas of ejc th~" oujsiva" ton~ patrov". If some expressions lead to hope there was life, all this leads one sadly to fear that all was an intellectual dogma. Still I say, The Lord forbid; for His grace is our resource, as above all.

		<a class="footnote" name="#321:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>The love of objections is one of the worst moral features possible. It is quite right to weigh them, and see that one is well founded in what the soul builds on. But there is moral proof in the power of an object to produce (where the soul is capable of feeling) affections which are the moral reflex, in a rightly constituted mind, of the object itself, and which are thus the proof of power, because the fruit of power. Now where there is this power in the object rightly exercised, the love of objections is only the proof of insensibility to the power which attracts and fixes the soul. It is moral incapacity to estimate what is excellent. The qualities displayed in the object do not convince and silence cavil. Why? Because the heart is incapable of estimating, by its own sentiments, these qualities -- perhaps does not like their superiority. This is infidelity. <p>A true heart loves what is excellent, because it is able to appreciate it, or at least to discern it; it is glad it should have its superiority, because, capable of appreciating excellence, it feels, in virtue of its own love of it, that it ought to have, and it desires that it should have, this place of superiority. This applies in an infinite degree to God in Christ; besides His immutable title to this place. Hence, for faith to be occupied with the positive object of it is the best and truest means of proof It carries its own unquestionable power with it. <p>There is another thing that helps our judgment; that is, that when the object is known and valued, the moral aim of the infidel is judged. "Their device is only to pull Him down whom thou wouldest exalt." The sagacity, and here the spiritual sagacity, of affection easily detects this. "Give God the praise!" -- the modern compliment of infidels also -- "As for this man, we know that he is a sinner," will not hide it. There is a kind of reasoning which flows from being oneself the subject of power, which infidel Pharisees cannot reach: theirs only creates astonishment, by its evident nonsense, to the simple mind who knows the power. "Why herein is a wonderful thing, that ye know not who he is, yet he hath opened my eyes." There is no mistake then. Mr. N. may ask, "What has this to do with scripture, or an historical document?" *He is found there*. No doubt Mr. N. has not found Him there; he does not know Him. He says, indeed, to the evangelical -- imitating language he has heard -- that he has tried both; he has a double experience -- the believer's and the infidel's. But this poor imitation of what converted persons, who have come to the knowledge of Christ, have said, is too miserably transparent to be anything but the shame of him who uses it. What did he experience at the first? The effect, on his own shewing, of believing a lie -- of supposing true what had no existence in truth. "A deceived heart hath turned him aside- he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand?" Let not the language seem hard. Mr. N. declares it is a lie; and that Jesus is not the Messiah. (Phases, page 225.) What was his first experience? -- "To any 'evangelical ' I have a right to say that, while he has a single, I have a double experience." (Phases, page 201.) Now how can he tell what the effects, "the spiritual fruits," if a living knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ are, since he does not believe there is such a person at all? His only past experience was, as he avows, a wholly false one. I ever hope it may not have been. "Spiritual fruits," in his case, are not those of the true knowledge in power of the Lord Jesus. He never had such; for if he really knew Jesus to be the Son of God, it was and must have been because He was so -- if He was so, He is so. Now Mr. N. declares it is (and hence was) all a delusion. His "spiritual fruits" were the fruits of a delusion -- of belief in an imposture. Think of a person coolly speaking of this in his own case! To what a state of moral reasoning, of moral susceptibilities, must he be reduced! "It was really operative," he tells us, "on my moral tastes, pursuits, and conduct." (Phases, page 2.) What was? <p>But I have said, infidels love obscurity. God allows, indeed, faith to be tested. We had seen self-boasting learning, at the end of the last century, relying on Hindoo Yugas of millions of years, and Chinese chronology of any length you please. Egyptian hieroglyphics being then illegible, the Zodiac of Dendera disproved the dates of the Mosaic account, by the long period of the earth's existence demonstrated by this very ancient monument. All here was obscure, and it suited infidel reasoning. Alas! Western astronomy and science examined Hindoo calculations and proved that the observations must have been made -- indeed, profess to be made (that conjunction being assumed to have existed at creation) -- in a certain position of the movable bodies of the heavens, and all the rest calculated backward, like Scaliger's Julian Period, making the great Calpa, or epoch, of similar conjunction; in fact, they were mere astronomical cycles. And still worse, hieroglyphics were read, and the Zodiac of Dendera was found to have been made in the reign of Augustus Caesar. Chinese chronology has suffered the like diminution, the Emperor Hoangti (B.C. 213) having destroyed all records, that everything might be dated from him. It is ascertained, as far as obscure traditions allow, that the real Hindoo dates of historical events agree pretty much with scripture history, and belong to epochs as recent as that history gives them. I do not here enter into details of course. It seems ascertained that the most ancient Hindoo astronomical treatise is not above seven hundred and fifty years old. (Hales¬ Chronology, vol 1, page 195.) It is of little moment. I refer to these circumstances to shew the disposition of infidels to get into the dark to make objections. The light dissipates them: they turn to others undaunted and unashamed. Their will is engaged in it. <p>So now their researches into the historical origin of the books of the Old Testament. On these points they can throw doubts, as they do not own the authority of the New. And why? Because the books, though we can trace their existence as far back as we have any records (and they are confirmed by references to the history contained in them as authentic, by fragments of the earliest known authors quoted in such books, as Josephus, Eusebius, etc.), yet are themselves the only existing records of the times they belong to. They are, beyond all controversy, the most ancient records in existence. Hence, when their own intrinsic power is not perceived, and their coherence as a moral whole, as a key to the whole world's history before God, is not understood, ample scope is found for speculating in the dark and raising objections. Still even here God has confounded them by such means as Egyptian antiquities, where the details of Exodus are found painted in yet brilliant colours on the walls of long lost buildings.

		<a class="footnote" name="#326:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>Mr. N., however, I perhaps should add, does not (apart from its accompaniments, and the immoral character of its deities) think so very badly of polytheism. He says (Phases, page 89), "It thus became clear to me, that polytheism as such is not a moral and spiritual, but at most only an intellectual, error." His indifference to the true God is a remarkable phenomenon. He had long ago been convinced "that the Spirit is evidently *God in the hearts of the faithful*, and nothing else." Now he "believed the Son to be derived from the Father, and not to be the Unoriginated," and was not a Ditheist: -- "No doubt! yet, after all, could I seriously think that, morally and spiritually, I was either better or worse for this discovery? I could not pretend that I was." Perhaps so; but then your state had nothing to say to God. Had you been a polytheist, you would not have been morally or spiritually the better or the worse for it, for it is not a moral or spiritual error. Noble ideas you must have of God, certainly! Let me caution my reader here, that if he finds "the Spirit" used in such writers, he must not fancy it is in any christian sense. This use of christian language, which keeps up to the eye a delusive appearance which hinders the mind being shocked, is perpetual in Mr. N.'s book. "I now," says he, "understood somewhat better his whole doctrine of 'the Spirit,' the coming of which had brought the Church out of a childish into a mature condition." Now when he wrote this phrase, he did not believe a word of the coming of the Spirit. It would be endless to multiply the instances of this kind of language -- in a word, of christian language preserved, when he does not believe a word of it. This use of language which the author does not believe does not startle, because it seems to belong to the period of his history which he is relating; but the book was written when he had discovered it was all false.

		Now I can understand in physical nature, where there is no will, an action of attractive forces which keeps in order the movements of bodies in various and periodically contradictory directions, or self-correcting contradictory directions, or self-correcting contradictory influences, because one will has imposed them all; but the application of this where there is a will is wholly false.<a name=328:4></a> Besides, "stable equilibrium," which, if "deranged," is, I humbly conceive, flat nonsense; because, if "deranged," it is not "stable;" nor, if deranged specially by the action of will, is there any reason why it should necessarily re-arrange itself; indeed, it has proved itself unstable.<a name=328:5></a> It did not maintain, far less is able to restore, a deranged equilibrium.<a name=328:6></a>

	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#336:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>This does not prove, as a fact, that He has; but it makes it unlikely that He has not. But while it cannot prove that God has communicated to man the knowledge of the things of God, it does prove that the supposition that He would not is a gross absurdity -- is merely the desire not to have to say to Him in His own way: and in spite of the infidel effort which takes effect when the morality of religious pretenders sinks below the standard of natural conscience, the need of some divine communication is such that, I may say, the universal feeling of man proves it by its cravings -- cravings which are so strong, that in the long run the most absurd and corrupt pretensions to it are preferred to none at all. It is of this all forms of priesthood have taken advantage. <p>And here I would notice a very remarkable circumstance, that, elevated and peculiar as was the priesthood among the Jews, they were not, as with false religions, the peculiar and chief communicators of divine knowledge. The prophets had this office; and God's character was maintained independently of, and often reproving, those who might have made an interested use of their nearness to Him. In Christianity there are no priests (save as all Christians are, and Christ above all). Judaism being founded on law, and God yet much hidden from man who could not come near under such a system, a priesthood was necessary, but betrayed the real state of things, thus expressed by the apostle -- "The way into the holiest was not yet made manifest, while as yet the first tabernacle was standing." Christianity being the manifestation of grace, and having brought men to God, there is not a priesthood, but a ministry to make known that grace, and build up those who have received it in further acquaintance with it; while all believers are themselves in the presence of God -- have access to the Father who Himself loves them -- are brought to God. Hence as to this point, ministry and the absence of a distinct priesthood essentially characterize Christianity. Priesthood characterizes the religion of Judaism, though God interfered sovereignly by prophets in mercy.

		Mr.<a name=342:1></a> Newman refers to one subject on which I will touch, as I think it will be generally useful.<a name=342:2></a> He objects to mediation as mischievous.<a name=342:3></a> Having never had any just conviction of sin, he does not feel the need of it.<a name=342:4></a> No one who has <i>for himself felt</i> what sin and grace are can hesitate a moment as to the value of it.<a name=342:5></a> Let the reader consult Job 9, and he may see the working of a true yet vexed soul under God's hand.<a name=342:6></a> It is all well talking of awe and reverence, etc.<a name=342:7></a>, and love, as Mr.<a name=342:8></a> N.<a name=342:9></a> does: but the denial of the need of a mediator is the denial of a holy judge, and our sense of God's being so.<a name=342:10></a> But it is important to have a clear apprehension of the nature and work of the Mediator.<a name=342:11></a>

		Mr.<a name=342:12></a> N.<a name=342:13></a>'s objection to it is this: that all moral profit arises from being brought into the presence of God, and that the notion of a mediator is a hindrance to this.<a name=342:14></a> Now this is plausible, because moral profit does arise from being brought into the presence of God; but it is altogether a fallacy.<a name=342:15></a> For our sense of the need of a mediator arises from the effect of our being brought into the presence of God; or (what is morally the same thing) so true an estimate of what God is, as makes us feel the impossibility of our standing before Him.<a name=342:16></a>

		In the passage I have referred to in Job, this is evidently seen, whatever temper he met it in.<a name=342:17></a> He could not answer God "one of a thousand.<a name=342:18></a>" If he called himself "perfect," his own mouth would condemn him.<a name=342:19></a> If he would "leave off his heaviness and comfort himself," God would not hold him innocent.<a name=342:20></a> If he should "wash himself with snow water, and make his hands never so clean, God would plunge him into the ditch.<a name=342:21></a>" And he adds, "Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, who should lay his hand upon us both.<a name=342:22></a>" Now I am not commenting here upon the spirit in which Job takes the matter up, for it was a wrong one: I adduce it to shew that the sense of the need of a mediator arises from the conviction of sin, and does not hinder it.<a name=342:23></a>

		This doctrine <i>is</i> sometimes used in a way calculated to give a false idea of God -- not precisely as to the effect of the presence of God upon the conscience, but as hiding divine love.<a name=342:24></a> The effect, as I have already said, of that presence is to present God as simply a Judge, and very often, while this thought of God remains unchanged in the mind, Christ is, on the other hand, looked at as One in whose love we can confide.<a name=342:25></a> But scripture is not answerable for this.<a name=342:26></a> God is a Judge; but Christ is never presented as an Intercessor with a Judge.<a name=342:27></a>

		The scriptural doctrine of a mediator is quite different from this.<a name=343:1></a> It not only leaves the full effect of God as light upon the soul, but brings it down close to the moral eye; and does it in the way of love, that we should be able to walk in that light.<a name=343:2></a> Christ <i>is God manifest in the flesh</i>.<a name=343:3></a> But while He is the light itself, this manifestation is love.<a name=343:4></a>

		See how John puts this point: "That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled of the Word of life (for the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us) .<a name=343:5></a>.<a name=343:6></a>.<a name=343:7></a> .<a name=343:8></a> This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.<a name=343:9></a> If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth.<a name=343:10></a>" Here we have no hindering the full discovery of God to the soul: it is that discovery, "The darkness is past, and the true light now shineth.<a name=343:11></a>" "The life was the light of men.<a name=343:12></a> That was the true light which lighteth [shineth upon] every man.<a name=343:13></a>" And, it did tell upon men's consciences, the presence of that living Word; and, if sin was confessed, attracted in grace; if sought to be hidden, it vexed, irritated, and alarmed; humble and unassuming as was the garb in which grace, for love's sake towards men, had clothed the light.<a name=343:14></a> So it is with the truth.<a name=343:15></a> It is indeed grace in testimony; but it reaches the conscience, and judges all men by the revelation of God Himself.<a name=343:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		What could have brought light and love (and morally speaking that is God) so near to man as the incarnation?<a name=343:17></a> It was in the way of reconciling, not imputing trespasses; but this was to engage man, away from sin (if that had been possible), by coming in grace and goodness towards himself.<a name=343:18></a> Mediation is, in this respect, the revelation of God Himself close to us, bearing directly on the conscience and heart of man; and so is the word of the gospel now.<a name=343:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ is not merely God manifested to us down here, He has suffered in our place, the Just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God.<a name=343:21></a> Looking at God as righteousness, as having "purer eyes than to behold iniquity" (and surely this does not hinder the effect of His presence as regards conscience), the just sense of sin would make us feel that we could not come into His presence, nor appear, defiled as we are, before His holy majesty.<a name=343:22></a> There is no just sense of sin, no real effect of His presence on the conscience, till this is felt -- no proper jealousy of right and wrong, till we estimate it thus, and bring God and ourselves together in thought, so as to produce it -- ourselves, who owe everything to Him.<a name=343:23></a> But we could not.<a name=343:24></a> He ought not, in justice, to allow such in His presence.<a name=343:25></a> But Christ gives Himself for these sins; and, putting them away, appears in the presence of God in the efficacy and in virtue of that work.<a name=343:26></a>

		Am I to ignore, then, my feebleness and failing?<a name=345:1></a> No, I judge what I a n by what I see of this glory, which is mine; and my feebleness and failure become the occasion of the exercise of grace, which does not lower God to the level of my failures, but which meets in the way of mercy the wants they prove to be in me, and lift me up out of them.<a name=345:2></a> We have a High Priest touched with the feeling of our infirmities, who was in all points tempted like as we are, without sin; so that we come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.<a name=345:3></a> Hence, in this also, mediation maintains for us the full display of God to ourselves, and alone can do so, and in the way of faith and grace, so as to be morally elevating while judging all inconsistent with itself.<a name=345:4></a> If Mr.<a name=345:5></a> N.<a name=345:6></a> thinks he could stand in the presence of God's majesty as he is and what he is, and compare himself with it, he knows neither himself nor God.<a name=345:7></a> Divine righteousness sets me there according to God; constant mediation obtains all the grace I need in the actual state I am in, and maintains me (without hiding my actual worthlessness from myself) in the full enjoyment of divine favour as known there, -- restores me if need be, -- maintains a just, practically holy, intercourse with that glory.<a name=345:8></a> Who has not this has none.<a name=345:9></a> Hence it is said, "If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the <i>righteous</i>" (that never alters) "and he is the <i>propitiation</i> for our sins.<a name=345:10></a>"

		"The old Hebrews," says Mr.<a name=347:1></a> N.<a name=347:2></a> (Phases, page 189), "believed only in evil spirits sent by God to do His bidding, and had no idea of a rebellious spirit that rivalled God.<a name=347:3></a> That idea was first imbibed in the Babylonish captivity, and apparently therefore must have been adopted from the Persian 'Ahriman,' or from the 'Melek Taous,' the 'Sheitan' still honoured by the Yezidi with mysterious fear.<a name=347:4></a> That the <i>serpent</i> in the early part of Genesis denoted the same Satan is probable enough: but this only goes to shew that that narrative is a legend imported from further East; since it is certain that the subsequent Hebrew literature has no trace of such an Ahriman.<a name=347:5></a>"

		This is a curious passage, in point of argument, singular in its logic, but more singular still in shewing how a theory forced into one's service to get rid of truth fades away, in spite of the effort, before the truth it seeks to get rid of.<a name=347:6></a> First, reader, you have it all clearly settled, "that idea was first imbibed in the Babylonish captivity.<a name=347:7></a>" Now if you believe this (though why we should we are not told.<a name=347:8></a> However, Mr.<a name=347:9></a> N.<a name=347:10></a> says so; and it is not certainly second hand faith with him: he believes it on his own authority), we may indeed be "peculiarly vexed to find so total a deficiency of clear and sound instruction on so vital a question" as "why we are to believe it;" as if one "were solely anxious to have people believe without caring on what ground they believe, although that is obviously the main point.<a name=347:11></a>" But if you do believe this, then you have a singularly nicely graduated logical progression: it was first imbibed then, and "apparently therefore" "must have been" -- so that now it cannot be otherwise than "adopted from the Persian Ahriman.<a name=347:12></a>" So that now we have indeed got "further East.<a name=347:13></a>" -- from the Hebrews to Babylon; and, since it certainly was imbibed in the captivity, it must have been from Persia.<a name=347:14></a> Well, I thought we had here got far East somewhat rapidly.<a name=347:15></a> But the reason puzzles me.<a name=347:16></a>

		But if we abide by Mr.<a name=348:18></a> N.<a name=348:19></a>'s theory, "our logic" is in still greater embarrassment.<a name=348:20></a> The reason that its being in Genesis shews that it is a legend imported from further East is, that the subsequent Hebrew literature has no trace of such an Ahriman.<a name=348:21></a> Now if the Pentateuch was first published in Josiah's reign, there was no subsequent Hebrew literature previous to the captivity, save at the utmost a small part of Jeremiah.<a name=348:22></a> All Hezekiah's prophets preceded the Pentateuch, as of course those of "the century preceding his reign;" and then, in what is subsequent Hebrew literature, Satan is certainly found.<a name=348:23></a> Thus Zechariah and Chronicles use the term unequivocally.<a name=348:24></a> Why then does Mr.<a name=348:25></a> N.<a name=348:26></a> say that "subsequent Hebrew literature has no trace of such an Ahriman?<a name=348:27></a>" It can only really be thus: he forgot his theory; and his conscience, more true than his memory, in happy forgetfulness, recognized the Pentateuch as the genuine, ancient, most ancient, "literature" of the Hebrews, written long and long before Hezekiah's prophets, time enough for the nation to have forgotten the doctrine of the Persian Ahriman, if they ever did.<a name=348:28></a>

		In Job two things are brought out -- an unbroken, impatient will, which set up to judge God and say that he was more righteous than He; but, at the same time, a heart which had a sense of relationship with God, though in rebellion against Him and writhing under His hand -- a perception of qualities in God which shewed a personal knowledge of Himself, which only longed to find Him, and knew when he did he should find Him such.<a name=354:1></a> He could not indeed find Him: He was in one way, and who could turn Him aside?<a name=354:2></a> But if he did, he would order his cause before Him: God Himself would put words in his mouth.<a name=354:3></a> There was that confidence in Him, that he counted upon His heart towards him.<a name=354:4></a> When he can get rid of the stupid importunities of his moralizing and heartless friends, he turns to cry after God with an "O that I might find Him!<a name=354:5></a>" In justice, he sees it is no use.<a name=354:6></a> How can a man plead with God?<a name=354:7></a> But in heart he will trust Him, if He slays him.<a name=354:8></a> Nothing can be more beautiful than the way he turns thus, casting aside his friends as he may, to throw himself into the arms of God, if he could only find Him.<a name=354:9></a> But all was not ready yet: the confidence would be sustained; but the will must be broken, self-complacency destroyed.<a name=354:10></a> In this process all manner of feelings come out -- impatient anger presumptuously arraigning God, acknowledging present government in pious justification of his ways; clearly proving that it was no present adequate proof of what God thought of a man, a deep personal heart sense of what God is expressed in confidence in Him.<a name=354:11></a> The heart was fully exercised: its evil brought out, its good -- its faith in God -- brought into play: but the riddle was not yet solved.<a name=354:12></a>

		Elihu then comes in, an interpreter, "one among a thousand," and brings in this truth -- that God deals personally with man.<a name=355:1></a> A general superintending government no doubt there is -- a God that judges the earth; but there is another kind of government -- that of souls.<a name=355:2></a> He turns man from his purpose.<a name=355:3></a> He hides pride from man.<a name=355:4></a> He hides not His eyes from the righteous.<a name=355:5></a> They are with kings; but He binds them in affliction and cords of iron to shew them their works, their transgressions, that they have exceeded.<a name=355:6></a> He chastens, He restores, He governs with a view to blessing -- and souls in a moral relationship with Himself.<a name=355:7></a> He was not God to terrify Job; yet Job could not answer, when God, acting in respect of an unjudged conscience and an unsubdued heart, was brought out.<a name=355:8></a>

		THE HUMAN ELEMENT IN INSPIRATION
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My Dear Brother,<p>As the question of inspiration has been so much before the minds of Christians, and indeed of all men, in countries where Christianity is professed, and is a vital question for every soul, I would desire to notice one point in connection with it, because on it even those who are accounted orthodox have used very equivocal language.<a name=365:1></a> It is what is called the "human element" in it.<a name=365:2></a> That there is a human element is evident, for it is men who are inspired, men whose language and whose minds have been used.<a name=365:3></a> I say, whose minds have been used; for the apostle tells of speaking with his understanding; but the expression is used to signify <i>also</i> the defect and errors to which man's mind is liable.<a name=365:4></a> Now this last means man's mind left to itself, that is, <i>not</i> inspired: a very different thing from inspiring man's mind.<a name=365:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The reason I notice it is, that the human element is of infinite price to us, the very character of the grace shewn to us and conferred on us.<a name=365:6></a> God's favour is not only shewn <i>to</i> man, but <i>in</i> man.<a name=365:7></a> In the blessed Lord -- the centre and effectuator of all grace to us -- this is evident, though this is much more than inspiration, for He is a Person, the Word made flesh, yet it characterizes all God's ways with us.<a name=365:8></a> It is what is divine in man.<a name=365:9></a> It has a human element -- birth, hunger, thirst, sorrow, suffering, His compassion moved by what He saw, growth in wisdom and stature, dependence in prayer, obedience, temptation (sin apart), and, when He had given Himself up to it, death (for which indeed He had expressly become a man); and though now in glory, yet the human element is there also.<a name=365:10></a> The Son of man is at the right hand of God, and when we are in that blessed place, He will gird Himself and make us to sit down to meat, and come forth and serve us.<a name=365:11></a> And this last, though surely a figure, yet is a figure of that blessed love in which He took upon Him the form of a servant and became a man, and continues to exercise now, as man who can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; and which He will then exercise as man to minister in perfect and devoted tenderness -- fit to win and fix man's heart -- divine love, where we can fully know its value in the service of that love; for love delights to serve, and He has become a man so to exercise it.<a name=365:12></a> It is His glory surely; what shews the infiniteness of divine love where angels desire to look into it; but it is, blessed be God, and therein infinite and blessed in a human element.<a name=365:13></a> God shews in the ages to come the exceeding riches of His grace, in His <i>kindness</i> towards us by Christ Jesus.<a name=365:14></a> The very character given to this grace is filanqrwpiva.<a name=365:15></a> So, when He was born, the unenvious angels celebrate glory to God in the highest, in (eujdociva ejn ajnqrwvpoi") good pleasure in men.<a name=365:16></a> It is for us a blessed, as it is a glorious theme.<a name=365:17></a> Now, though this was different from all else (for it is the Incarnate Word), yet it characterizes all God's ways with men.<a name=365:18></a> Inspiration (that is, the Spirit of Christ acting in the limited manifestation of God's mind in whatever degree in a man) has this character, and it is its peculiar value.<a name=365:19></a> It was given in various ways, as well as at divers times, dealing with man and unfolding the things of man historically in relation to God, and in moral testimony, so that we might have God's mind about them, either according to the, light which man possessed, so as to be thereby responsible, or revelations of God's own mind and judgment, so as to teach, which last was only fully revealed in Christ, who spoke what He was in His own perfection, and was what He spoke -- God manifest in flesh, the Word made flesh and dwelling among us.<a name=365:20></a>

		The revelation of the New Testament is different in character, because it has taken man out of the earth and up to heaven; and hence its proper revelations (I mean after Christ's death) are the bringing in of present heavenly relations and character into earthly things.<a name=366:1></a> Hence, save prophecies, which are not proper to it, it is the man in heaven in all the details of life on earth -- more intimate, more familiar, more present and practical.<a name=366:2></a> The Christian is the epistle of Christ -- hence has to be formed by the word of revelation into His image, and then guided in the manifestation of it.<a name=366:3></a> It is evident how fully there is a human element here, not only in our realization of Christianity, but in the revelation of it; but it is the human element taken possession of by God.<a name=366:4></a> Divine power, and what, if the use of the word were not liable to be abused, might fairly be called inspiration, works in everyone who is blessed in the use of a gift, and in all spiritual wisdom; that is, God acts and forms the judgment, and the agent is only so far blessed as this is the case.<a name=366:5></a> But this scripture carefully distinguishes from inspiration in the sense we now use it in, viz.<a name=366:6></a>, communications having a divine authority over the soul, because given by God Himself.<a name=366:7></a> An inspired man may say, "I have received mercy of the Lord to be found faithful;" "I think also that I have the Spirit of God;" and add, "The married I command, not I, but the Lord;" "to the rest speak I, not the Lord.<a name=366:8></a>" Thus the apostle carefully distinguishes the sound and godly wisdom which he had experimentally by the Spirit -- the action of the Holy Ghost in his own mind morally -- from what he had from the Lord Himself, so as to give it as His command.<a name=366:9></a> This has been stupidly alleged as shewing all was not inspired, since part was distinguished as spiritual experience.<a name=366:10></a> But this is a mistake as to the whole nature of inspiration, and leads me to some notice of this.<a name=366:11></a>

		The truth of inspiration is not that all that is stated or recorded as done or spoken was inspired.<a name=367:1></a> We have the devil's words, and wicked men's words, and holy, but failing, men's words; but in such cases the writer was inspired to give us these things as he has given them.<a name=367:2></a> So God, knowing our liability to be misled as to inspiration, has inspired Paul to record the difference between the highest spiritual wisdom and apprehension, and inspiration.<a name=367:3></a> There cannot be on this point a more important inspired testimony.<a name=367:4></a> It decides the question recently raised, and judges the error into which presumptuous men have fallen.<a name=367:5></a> The operation of the Spirit forming and leading men's minds is not inspiration in the proper sense of the word.<a name=367:6></a> Now the forms and bearings of inspiration are various, though the source and the authority be one, because there is a human element.<a name=367:7></a> God's works have to be revealed, and they are so by a simple and blessed statement of them, such as nothing but inspiration could give.<a name=367:8></a> Man's failure and sin has to be traced and brought to light in its origin and its development.<a name=367:9></a> For this latter God's ways had to be revealed; but this had a double character, the history of the facts in connection with which these ways were manifested, and the dealings of God in which they were expressed.<a name=367:10></a>

		Let us remember the simple principle, that God's entering into man and using the human element for His service is just the opposite to His leaving a man to his own thoughts and mental appreciations, which is what is meant by the human element when unbelief talks of it; and the history is not only man's history, but a man's history of it.<a name=370:1></a> But it is man's history so as to bring out fully what he is with God and under God's dealings, so as to teach all men by it and in all ages, and foreshadow things to come; and hence a divinely given history of it all, yet with the historian entering into it all as a living history in which the people and himself were interested, or it would not have been reality then nor now.<a name=370:2></a> I speak of facts; I read it, see Moses in a large part of it acting, feeling, thinking, speaking, praising; nor can I separate, nor do I desire to separate, the account given from the reality of the thoughts and feelings of him who recounts it.<a name=370:3></a> Nor, if it be Abraham and other history, is there any <i>real</i> difference, though the proof be less apparent; for in both it is the Holy Ghost recounting by man what passed in and with man.<a name=370:4></a> Only, when of other persons, the interest of Moses or the sacred historian in them is less evident; but I believe Moses' heart and interest went with Abraham's history as much as with his own, as much as when he said, "Ye have been rebellious against the Lord since the day that I knew you.<a name=370:5></a>"

		Hence we have, in the history by various persons, the distinct succession of all the ways and dealings of God from one mind, ascertained from a history in which the individual writers had (for the most part could have) no knowledge of the whole scheme itself.<a name=370:6></a> Innocence, man without law and lawless, promise coming in as a thing apart, man under law, under priesthood, obedient royalty with law, sovereign unlimited royalty over the world, prophets to recall to law and to foretell the coming One and judgments, and at last the Seed of promise, grace in the world -- this is history, history as it appears in fact in scripture, yet principles of dealing with man which test him morally in every way, and bring out the whole state in which he is, in which I am, before God; yet the connection of one part with another no one of the writers could have had in his mind, or does not refer to.<a name=370:7></a> All is man; but all is man brought out by God's dealings, and the record given of it by man, as interested in it as the history of his own people, or what led to it from the creation onward, but as the people beloved of God in whom God displayed His ways, and as a whole of which no one man was author -- a divine exhibition of what man was, and God's ways with him.<a name=370:8></a>
