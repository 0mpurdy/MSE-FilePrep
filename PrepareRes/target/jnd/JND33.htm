		REVIEW OF "LECTURES ON THE SECOND ADVENT," AND "THE APOCALYPSE UNFULFILLED"¦
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>To the Editor of the "Christian Herald</i>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Dear Sir, <br>The increasing extent and progress of conviction as to the truth and nearness of our Lord's coming (to which I can bear personal witness), and the practical shape which it has assumed, makes it the more important that those most occupied in it, and therefore most likely to speak much of it, should have clear and consistent views upon the subject -- clear, and consistent with the full statement of scriptural truth.<a name=1:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The publications which are set at the head of this article contain the most popular and common exposition -- perhaps the only full one -- presenting, on some very important points, a very distinct view, commonly current amongst the expectants of our Lord's coming.<a name=1:2></a> Into this view many have been led by the actual clearness and apparent accuracy of the statements in these very books.<a name=1:3></a> You will not, therefore, I trust, think it amiss that I should briefly attempt to inquire into their soundness, and expose the error into which the author appears to me, as to a part of his subject, to have fallen.<a name=1:4></a> They have, however, I should state, very different value in my eyes.<a name=1:5></a> Of the first of them, I can say that I read it with the greatest satisfaction; perhaps the more so, as, with the exception of that part which more properly belongs to the second publication, I found it so exceedingly consistent with my own views.<a name=1:6></a> I should except, indeed, also the view given of the seventy weeks, on which I will offer some comment.<a name=1:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The introductory and <i>sixth</i> lectures are as clear and succinct an exposition of their distinct subjects as one could desire in so brief a shape.<a name=1:8></a> In fact, on all prophecy that is properly Jewish, it appears to me that Mr.<a name=1:9></a> Burgh has been favoured (with the exception only of what I conceive to be a confusion between the Assyrian and Antichrist) with great clearness of apprehension; as all, I suppose, will recognise the lucidness of statement which, with a supposed carefulness of proof from Scripture, has given currency to his views, even where they appear to me to be unfounded.<a name=1:10></a> But, on the other hand, I think that Mr.<a name=1:11></a> Burgh has wholly failed in this -- that he does not see the mystical use of the language and circumstances of literal prophecy to the great parenthetic anomaly of the Gentile dispensation; and that consequently, as a whole, his exposition of the book of Revelation, which is the expression and history of this, is founded on a false principle, and fundamentally erroneous.<a name=1:12></a> It is a transfer of that in which he is right as to the Jews, to that which uses the characters for another purpose, and in which, therefore, because he continues its original use and force, he is precisely and exactly wrong: that is, his view of the book of Revelation arises from his <i>not</i> seeing that in which it consists -- the use of the language and characters of prophetic testimony in another and special way, by which the history of the mystical body of Christ is developed, as that of His literal bride, the Jewish church, was by its ordinary use.<a name=1:13></a> This is a definite and important principle, as it is evident that upon its truth or error depends the whole tissue of the interpretation of the book, whatever diversity there might yet be in detail; while we shall see that the principle on which it is founded affects many other scriptural interpretations.<a name=1:14></a> The confusion which has consequently arisen in Mr.<a name=1:15></a> Burgh's mind, by the exclusion of any general development of the character of the Gentile apostasy, and the <i>confinement</i> of the statements of the Revelation to "Crisis," has, as I think I shall be enabled to shew, by leading him to confound Antichrist's actings amongst the Jews, where it is in <i>Crisis</i>, both as to them and the Gentile powers, with his actings in the general Gentile apostasy, induced direct contradictions and inconsistencies in his statements.<a name=1:16></a> And at this we cannot be surprised; for, if he has forced himself to apply to one period, passages applicable to two very distinct states of things, it is no wonder that, when brought into juxtaposition, they are not found to hold together.<a name=1:17></a>

		Some of these contradictions I shall now notice -- not, I trust Mr.<a name=2:1></a> Burgh will feel, with any invidious object, but as illustrating the error on which, it appears to me, he has framed his system.<a name=2:2></a> I will only make two observations before I do so.<a name=2:3></a> One is, sir, to complain of the Church a little, for their readiness to receive a system when any one will make it for them, without investigating the proofs of its statements; and the other is, that the importance of my present inquiry consists in this -- that Mr.<a name=2:4></a> Burgh's views divert the attention of Christians from the present actings of antichristian principles, as now deceiving the nations, to some supposed or future actings of a personal Antichrist, with which they <i>may</i> have nothing to do; and this I conceive to be most injurious.<a name=2:5></a> The time and principles of Antichrist I believe to be daily developing themselves, and the time to be fast approaching in which it will be said, "He that is unjust, let him be unjust still; and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still.<a name=2:6></a> And he that is righteous, let him be righteous still; and he that is holy, let him be holy still.<a name=2:7></a>" Nor do I know a more solemn consideration, nor one which drives a believer closer to Christ, and the supply of the Spirit, for salvation and direction.<a name=2:8></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first example which I shall take, as illustrating the careless confusion of Antichrist's actings in Jerusalem, and his evil in the Gentile apostasy, is the exposition of the little open book, in the Sixth Lecture on the Apocalypse.<a name=3:1></a> Mr.<a name=3:2></a> Burgh applies the whole of this to the personal acting of Antichrist in the literal temple of Jerusalem.<a name=3:3></a> Now that Antichrist will place his abomination there, in the way understood by Mr.<a name=3:4></a> Burgh, I fully believe, and think it a very important truth.<a name=3:5></a> But it is equally evident to me that this passage can have nothing to say to it; for the very gist of this passage is precisely opposed to the special point of Antichrist's actings there.<a name=3:6></a> <i>There</i> the point of Antichrist's actings, is, that he sits in the temple, and the sanctuary is defiled.<a name=3:7></a> <i>Here</i> the precise point is, that they are measured, and the rest is given -- the court without and the city is given -- to the Gentiles; so that they are diametrically opposed in their essential characters.<a name=3:8></a> I do not notice this as an error merely, but as illustrating the confusion of principle in applying what is literal, and Jewish, and consummating, to what is Gentile, and moral, and mystical.<a name=3:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Take another point, arising from the same principle -- page 152 of the "Lectures on the Second Advent.<a name=3:10></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"For half of the week (three-and-a-half years) he (Antichrist) is true to this covenant; but he then breaks it, and for the last half, the remaining three-and-a-half years, the "time, times and a half," "forty-two months," or "one thousand two hundred and sixty days," he "causes the sacrifice and the oblation to cease"; and .<a name=3:11></a>.<a name=3:12></a>.<a name=3:13></a> "he places the abomination that maketh desolate.<a name=3:14></a>""
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, if we turn to chapter 8 of the same book (of Daniel), we shall find the consequence of thus forcing all interpretation into the literal crisis; for there we learn -- "How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice" (that is, "by him was the daily sacrifice taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down"), "and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?<a name=4:1></a> And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days, then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.<a name=4:2></a>" Now, if I am to take these things as declaring the literal actings of Antichrist for so many days, I have, in one case, the dominion and treading down of Antichrist to continue 1,260 days, or half the week; and, in the other, 2,300 days, or very nearly the whole week.<a name=4:3></a> (Compare "Lectures on the Revelation," pages 133, 134.<a name=4:4></a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, in Lecture 8 on the Revelation, the 144,000 are the remnant among the Jews.<a name=4:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"In verse 6 commences the part of the prophecy which more immediately and exclusively affects the Gentile world.<a name=4:6></a>" "Hitherto we have been occupied with the future destinies of the Jewish people; .<a name=4:7></a>.<a name=4:8></a>.<a name=4:9></a> now the Gentile world and the other nations of the earth come under consideration.<a name=4:10></a> This is after the beast has arisen, etc.<a name=4:11></a> Nor even is this preaching of the gospel for the purposes of conversion; it will be to test, not convert, the nations -- "for <i>a witness</i> to all nations"; that is, as I take it, finally to decide the great controversy between Christ and Antichrist -- to shew who is for Christ, and who is against Him.<a name=4:12></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Mr.<a name=4:13></a> Burgh then refers to the warning of the third angel, as confirmatory of this character of the testimony: that is, that "If any man worship, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God," etc.<a name=4:14></a> (Revelation 14: 9).<a name=4:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Mr.<a name=4:16></a> Burgh continues: --
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"As, then, I before said, the period here alluded to is the period set for the decision of the great controversy on this earth between Christ and Antichrist -- between the true God, as revealed in the gospel in the Person of Christ, and him who will then "sit in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.<a name=4:17></a>" This eventful crisis will be ushered in by a renewed preaching of the everlasting gospel to every nation under heaven," etc.<a name=4:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the ninth lecture we then read, that in which I fully agree: --
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"The faithful servants of God are removed from the scene of judgment.<a name=4:19></a>'' (Page 158.<a name=4:20></a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But previous to this crisis, every nation under heaven has been tested.<a name=4:21></a> Those that have been faithful, and killed, or appointed unto death, removed; and those that worshipped the beast are to be tormented, day and night, for ever and ever.<a name=4:22></a> Who is for Christ, and who against Him, has been shewn.<a name=4:23></a> But
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"The apostasy must first be consummated, and afterwards judged, before there will be a free course for the word of God.<a name=4:24></a>" (Page 160.<a name=4:25></a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Then shall the nations be converted to the faith of Christ.<a name=4:26></a>" (Page 161.<a name=4:27></a>)
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=5>[Page 5]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here, again, in the course of these two chapters, from this love of crisis, concentrating all the prophetic testimony of the Revelation to the actings of Antichrist in that crisis, we have a positive interpretation inconsistent with itself.<a name=5:1></a> For, after the withdrawing of the saints, and giving up of <i>all others</i> to the worshipping of the beast, and therefore to irremediable torment consequent upon the critical test of the everlasting gospel being put to them, we have, upon the judging of Antichrist, the nations converted by another and subsequent preaching of the gospel, as associated with the new dispensation.<a name=5:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another instance of inconsistency, arising from the same cause, is to be found in the view taken of the dragon and the beast, in Lecture 3, on the Second Advent, and Lecture 7, on the Revelation.<a name=5:3></a> All is to be forced into the crisis in Judea.<a name=5:4></a> But what is the consequence?<a name=5:5></a> The dragon is the fourth beast, previous to the existence of the ten kingdoms; the little horn, before whom three fell, is the Antichrist, the second beast, during whose continuance the ten horns are in existence.<a name=5:6></a> That is, Antichrist personally, as the head of the ten, or rather seven, horns, is the persecuting power of the Jews in Judea.<a name=5:7></a> But this dragon, during whose time the horns had no existence,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Persecuted the woman, that is, the Jewish nation, against whom Antichrist, in this his short reign, will, for reasons before stated, direct all his malignity," etc.<a name=5:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So that, from pressing it all into one scene, the identity of the dragon and the beast is denied and affirmed almost in the same breath; for the dragon is affirmed to be the fourth beast, exclusively before the ten kings, and they to have their place with and under Antichrist, directing all his malignity, when thus formed, against the Jews.<a name=5:9></a> Yet have we the dragon, as Antichrist, acting against the woman, that is, the Jews, and that in the land (see page 136, on Revelation), though, as yet, characteristically of his dragon state, there are no kings at all.<a name=5:10></a> And yet, Antichrist is the horn that rises after the ten horns, or kings, and subdues three.<a name=5:11></a> The cause of the inconsistency is obvious: all was to be brought, at any rate, into the climax.<a name=5:12></a> And indeed, though all the malignity of Antichrist is here directed against the Jews, elsewhere we learn that he is to kill all the Gentile saints also, or, at least, they are to be delivered to death.<a name=5:13></a> What conclusion do I draw from all this?<a name=5:14></a> That the attempt to force everything into the three years and a half, during which Antichrist is to sit in the temple of God in Jerusalem, involves necessarily, in contradictions and inconsistencies, which prove the falseness of the principles from which they flow; besides that, the exercise of that power by which all the nations are wielded against the Jews in that day, supposes, and especially as regards the ten kings, the exercise of all that evil and deceivableness, as "man of sin," previous to the holding and exercise of that power in Judea, which especially concerns Christendom to beware of; and that the system, which supposes the dangerous actings of Antichrist to be confined to the time of his evil reign in Judea, necessarily, in contradiction of itself, supposes him to have previously so powerfully practised by deceit or violence, that the ten kings have given their power to him, and that he is there, by virtue of those deceivings, as agent of Satan, the prince of this world.<a name=5:15></a> And, what is remarkable, Mr.<a name=5:16></a> Burgh's system precisely puts out of sight, and treats as a nullity, all that part of Antichrist's actings, in which alone, even according to his own system, we are concerned; that is, the power by which he deceives and carries after him the ten kings, or kingdoms; and, I may add, this confirms the argument previously gone into, as to the everlasting gospel.<a name=5:17></a> For the kingdoms of Christendom have manifestly been deceived previously to the preaching of the everlasting gospel, if that be subsequent, as Mr.<a name=5:18></a> Burgh supposes, to the setting up of Antichrist's throne in Jerusalem.<a name=5:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=6>[Page 6]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will observe, sir, that I am not considering these merely as particular misinterpretations, but as inconsistencies flowing from, and therefore shewing the fallacy of the system of interpretation.<a name=6:1></a> It seems to me exceedingly inconsistent to call the beast Antichrist, when Antichrist cannot be till the horns are all crowned; for he is to arise up as a little horn after them, and subdue three; and yet the ten are to "have power as kings one hour with the beast.<a name=6:2></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=7>[Page 7]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I have no object in going at large into mere errors.<a name=7:1></a> One or two, which in another way affect the system, I shall notice.<a name=7:2></a> Popery, by those who hold these views, is made but little of, and all that is not concentrated in the personal Antichrist is immaterial.<a name=7:3></a> Thus, the fifth trumpet having been settled (for no other reason, that I can see, but having a king called Apollyon) to be Antichrist, that is, observe, the last great final opposer of Christ, including everything, of the next, "far more terrible," nothing decided can be spoken.<a name=7:4></a> No wonder!<a name=7:5></a> Again, the sixth seal, it is quite clear, we are told, can be nothing but the final wrath of the Lamb, closing the whole scene of earthly power.<a name=7:6></a> It is so plainly His second coming, that "there is no room for difference of opinion" (page 52).<a name=7:7></a> Yet the next thing we read of, is, the holding of the winds, previous to the outbreaking of all Antichrist's doings; and, says, Mr.<a name=7:8></a> Burgh, "the trumpets are but the detail of the seventh seal" (page 87); that is, after the final wrath of the Lamb, which none could abide, come all the manifestations of Antichrist's power; and the kings of the earth, and of the whole world, set up against the Lamb; and Antichrist himself desolates, according to Mr.<a name=7:9></a> Burgh's system, for <i>the whole period of prophetic history</i>, sitting in the temple of God, as God, raging against all, even to death, who will not worship him.<a name=7:10></a> The question, <i>then</i>, sir, is, who is able to endure <i>his</i> wrath?<a name=7:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I confess, sir, that, plausible and easy as it may appear, when read by itself, it appears to me a very superficial system, and, when compared with Scripture, not to be for a moment tenable, and the whole of it arises from the effort to contract all to the three years and a half, and apply it to Judea, with yet the forced consciousness that it does concern the Gentiles.<a name=7:12></a> Thus, the prayers of all saints are the prayers of the hundred and forty-four thousand sealed Jews, wherever all the other saints are, and whatever they are doing; yet, the first four trumpets, in answer, fall literally on the earth, sea, rivers, and trees, sun, moon, and stars.<a name=7:13></a> The fifth, however, and (page 87) all the trumpets, afflict only the Jewish nation; though, what part of the Jewish nation the <i>literal</i> sun and moon are, it would be hard to say; however, so it is argued (pages 87, 88).<a name=7:14></a> Again, as to the seals, we are told to conclude that, because there is, "Behold a white horse, and one that sat on him," and that a white horse is mentioned in chapter 19, therefore he that sat on him is clearly the same.<a name=7:15></a> It may be so, but I do not see why, on any ground that would not prove each individual in the armies of heaven to be Jesus Christ also, for they all sat on white horses.<a name=7:16></a> The emblem of the white horse has nothing to do with who sits on him.<a name=7:17></a> But we are told that it is Christ's second advent, and the horses which follow it are the actings of Christ in judgment, as come -- I say, <i>as come</i>, or else the coming, after all, is figurative; and, to say the least, Mr.<a name=7:18></a> Burgh's language here is very vague.<a name=7:19></a> But, as far as I understand, it is King Messiah Himself come forth to destroy His enemies; and then we are referred to Matthew 24 for the identical signs.<a name=7:20></a> But there, all these things precede the coming of the Son of Man; and we are expressly told, that "the end is not yet"; in a word, they are but "the beginning of sorrows"; and, <i>after all</i>, the coming is as the lightning.<a name=7:21></a> Yet we are told that the parallelism is perfect, not only in the events, but in the order of their occurrence.<a name=7:22></a> I wonder the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom, the great test, as Mr.<a name=7:23></a> Burgh has stated elsewhere (a statement I am by no means disposed to question, though I do his use of it), did not arrest his mind as to the accuracy of this most unfortunate comparison.<a name=7:24></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, sir, the supposed uncertainty of interpretation, as to the two-horned beast, is made the subject rather of triumph, on the part of Mr.<a name=8:1></a> Burgh, though he gives no additional light whatever on the subject.<a name=8:2></a> But it ought to have led Mr.<a name=8:3></a> Burgh, I think, to more soberness of consideration on the subject, when he found, besides his favourite Antichrist, the beast, the third, or two-horned beast, at Armageddon, as the false prophet, and a distinct subject of destruction.<a name=8:4></a> He appears, too, in his zeal to substitute the personal Antichrist for Popery, to forget, that whatever may be the wicked and monstrous presumption of the Antichrist in Jerusalem, <i>in Babylon</i> "was found the blood of prophets and of saints, <i>and of all that were slain upon the earth</i>.<a name=8:5></a>" I leave to more full development the connection between this and chapter 17.<a name=8:6></a> This only, that it is not itself the beast, and that in <i>her</i> was found, etc.<a name=8:7></a>; and that, supposing, now, it be merely the literal city of Rome (the lowest supposition), it is not Antichrist at Jerusalem which is thus charged with the accumulated guilt of the blood of all that were slain upon the earth.<a name=8:8></a> In a word, sir, it is plain to me that there are two characters in which Antichrist (I use it now in an extended sense) is developed.<a name=8:9></a> The <i>one</i> of deceivableness, and perhaps using power, and so sometimes <i>causing</i> to be killed; the <i>other</i> of power, in which he acts haughtily against God as the <i>revealed</i> "man of sin.<a name=8:10></a>" In the latter of these two characters he acts against the Jews in Jerusalem; in the former, and now especially, in deceivableness as separated from power, we particularly have to do with it, and in this is his great guilt.<a name=8:11></a> In this way he gathers the power which he will use to his own destruction in that day.<a name=8:12></a> I say not what desperate deception, as well as power, he will use in that day amongst the Jews; but I say that the spirit of evil, by which he gathers and carries up there the power which he then exercises, is that with which we have to do.<a name=8:13></a> And "the deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish, because they receive not the love of the truth that they might be saved," will find its application, not amongst Jews, but amongst Gentiles, to whom the truth was preached.<a name=8:14></a> And this character, though finding its full manifestation in his false anti-regal power, and therefore not excluding this, is that in which he is also fully developed in the New Testament scriptures.<a name=8:15></a> And if this be once admitted, the system on which this interpretation of the Revelation is founded falls to the ground; and we are enabled, with whatever additional light the investigation may have afforded us, to pursue our inquiry into the Revelation, unfettered by a system which, as it appears to me, must be added to the many which it rejects; and which, while I must feel it to be superficial in its inductions, is founded on a principle as all-important, which, to my mind, is simply ignorance of the whole frame of New Testament prophecy, and mars its great aim -- the warning of <i>the Gentile church</i>.<a name=8:16></a> For, I repeat, it is quite clear that, with all its confusion of application, Mr.<a name=8:17></a> Burgh's system does not at all contemplate those actings of evil, by which the nations are carried up by Antichrist to, and against, Jerusalem, and their doom irrevocably sealed.<a name=8:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=9>[Page 9]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Save as applied to the point in question, I have stated little of my own views.<a name=9:1></a> I confess I find it more profitable to learn from Scripture, than to frame a system.<a name=9:2></a> If the Lord permit me, in time and service, I will send you some things which appear to me the mind of God in Scripture, and shall be glad to be corrected by any of your correspondents; merely saying, that the two great symbolical powers of Nebuchadnezzar and Darius seem to me to give the full clue to the history of the times of the Gentiles, ended in and by Antichrist.<a name=9:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards, then, the Jews, and the great results, it appears to me that Mr.<a name=9:4></a> Burgh is exceedingly clear, and may be always read with profit.<a name=9:5></a> As regards the Revelation, I think he has manifestly mistaken the whole principle and structure of the prophecy, from beginning to end.<a name=9:6></a> I must also add, that his views of symbol appear to me to be without any principle whatever, as his statements on the subject are most astonishingly hasty and unfounded.<a name=9:7></a> It would be impossible to go into this at large in such a communication as the present; I will only remark, that his assertion (page 83 of the "Lectures on Revelation"), "Scripture history affords a precedent for one interpretation, but Scripture does not afford any precedent for the other," is one of the most unprecedented assertions anybody ever met with, to a person who had ever read the Scriptures at all.<a name=9:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And I would here, sir, remark, that, clear as Mr.<a name=10:1></a> Burgh's interpretation of the seals may seem to some, I confess I can gain no determinate idea of what he means from it.<a name=10:2></a> I find, in page 28, that
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"The book of Revelation is thus the book of the Lord's second advent, and is solely occupied with the account of the last great crisis, with the coming of Christ, and the attendant events, during the several acts of His taking to Himself, and redeeming, His inheritance.<a name=10:3></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Accordingly, the <i>first</i> seal is Christ going forth, to which he makes parallel the question, "What shall be the sign of thy coming?<a name=10:4></a>" though, what the force of such a question can be to the parallelism, I cannot see.<a name=10:5></a> However, it is the last great crisis, and Christ's going forth to it.<a name=10:6></a> Now, I must ask, What does Mr.<a name=10:7></a> Burgh mean by "Christ's going forth to it"?<a name=10:8></a> It is not, manifestly, His personal coming in Judea, though the quotation of Psalm 45 would lead one to suppose so; for, in page <i>55</i>, we have merely preparatory judgments, instead of improvements, till "God's four sore judgments shall have devastated the <i>world</i>.<a name=10:9></a> And all this is to be but "the beginning of sorrows" -- the beginning of sorrows, I will here ask Mr.<a name=10:10></a> Burgh, <i>to whom</i>?<a name=10:11></a> He has parallelised Matthew <i>24</i> with this: whose sorrows does he think Matthew <i>24</i> refers to?<a name=10:12></a> Here he says, "Will the Church of Christ remain couched?<a name=10:13></a>" etc.<a name=10:14></a> However this may be the first seal is,

		That is, Mr.<a name=11:2></a> Burgh allows (and indeed reasons at large elsewhere, and, as I have said, I think very clearly), in Judea; yet, as we have seen, all these arrows are the judgments which devastate the <i>world</i>, and all this to be but the beginning of sorrows.<a name=11:3></a> Again, all the arrows refer to that conflict, the book being occupied solely with the last great crisis; yet, speaking of these very seals, or arrows of judgment Mr.<a name=11:4></a> Burgh says:

		So that, after they have been shewn to be arrows in the hearts of "the confederate nations, who, at the era of his advent, shall oppose them, and who shall then fall under Him, as in Revelation 19," we find the sixth seal itself to be after all those as signs -- "at least those signs by which it (His coming) is more immediately announced.<a name=11:6></a>" To me, clear as it may seem to others, there is nothing but confusion in all this; and the confusion, it appears to me, is simply this -- that Mr.<a name=11:7></a> Burgh saw nothing but with the last great crisis before his eyes, and it mingled itself confusedly with all, while the intrinsic evidence of the passages gave them a positive force which he could not help stating; and in the system he had formed obliged him to put them in an order, which made the confusion more determinate and marked.<a name=11:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I think students of prophecy are indebted to Mr.<a name=11:9></a> Burgh, as to every one else who has written candidly on the subject; but I do not think he has interpreted the book of Revelation rightly or successfully, and, by making a system of it, he has made all his errors hang together.<a name=11:10></a> I will freely submit my own thoughts to his judgment and criticism, I trust for the same just and useful purpose that he has done, when opportunity is given me.<a name=11:11></a>

		I have merely been able, my dear sir, in much occupation, to trace hastily those things which appear to me evidences of the fallacy of the <i>system</i> which Mr.<a name=11:12></a> Burgh has put forward in his Lectures on the Revelation; and I point this out as the fallacy -- the concentrating the actings of Antichrist to the last exhibition of him in Judea; and it is exceedingly material for us to see it so, because it is his previous actings with which we are concerned, and by which, as Mr.<a name=11:13></a> Burgh's system implies (while it denies), we are liable to be deceived.<a name=11:14></a> And here I must charge these lectures with inconsiderate confidence of haste; because, if Antichrist was to sit in Jerusalem, as head of a great apostate system, it ought to have involved, instead of refuted, the consideration of the apostasy of which he had previously made himself the head -- an apostasy at present working in the world, and in which we are all vitally and immediately concerned.<a name=11:15></a> How much this presses upon my mind, I shall not at present dwell upon; and

		It is, although not a pleasant, at any rate an exceedingly easy task to answer a hostile attack, when the opponent himself gives the answer.<a name=13:6></a> Such is the case with the article contained in the "Zionsbote," "upon Darbyism.<a name=13:7></a>" The arguments of the writer are chiefly summed up in the statement of two antitheses, expressed in the words: "We say, Everything must be restored, as it was in the apostle's time; We can never return, the Darbyites say, to what existed at the time of the apostles.<a name=13:8></a>" In his opinion everything must be revived in the church according to apostolic model; and his censure affects the so-called Darbyites, because, instead of assenting to his conception, they rather maintain that, since the church has abandoned her first state and is in apostasy, according to the clearest and most unambiguous testimonies of the Scriptures, she is not capable of restoration.<a name=13:9></a>

		Then, after the writer has been somewhat zealous over the bad principles of the brethren he indicts, he finds occasion for the remark, which defeats his contention: "Moreover <i>nothing remains until the Lord come</i>, but that every Christian take pains according to the best of his knowledge and conscience to ascertain and to carry out the mind of Christ; but so that the fullest brotherly relationship may obtain between the different church parties.<a name=13:10></a>" In fact, no Christian who is unprejudiced and free from bias will be able to close his eyes to such contradictions.<a name=13:11></a> What is the meaning, then, of wishing to restore everything in the church as it was in the apostle's time, if it must be confessed that at the end nothing remains but Christian parties, in which every member has to ascertain and carry out the will of Christ according to the best of his knowledge and conscience?<a name=13:12></a> Were there such parties in the time of the apostles?<a name=13:13></a> Do they so much as bear the seal of apostolic recognition?<a name=13:14></a> Certainly not.<a name=13:15></a> Jewish prejudices, as we know, threatened to split up the assembly at Antioch into two parties; but the wisdom of God prevented the deadly evil; and peace even and prosperity grew out of this very evil for the assembly at Jerusalem; Acts 15.<a name=13:16></a> In Corinth also church parties displayed their first germs; but apostolic power was present, and apostolic energy was exercised to restore divine order in the church.<a name=13:17></a> But where is there now that apostolic energy?<a name=13:18></a> Where is there an assembly that sends its ministers into all communities, so that all can enjoy the blessed message?<a name=13:19></a> Neither such energy, nor such an assembly is within the range of possibility in our days.<a name=13:20></a>

		The restoration of the church according to apostolic model, consequently, makes the previous restoration of apostles an absolute necessity.<a name=14:1></a> As Christians will not recognise their inability to restore everything, they sink into the state of indifference in respect of the evil which they cannot remedy.<a name=14:2></a> But instead of a recognition of their own incapacity, the willingness to continue in a bad, unscriptural, condition is in fact one of the saddest phenomena amongst Christians of our day.<a name=14:3></a> They refuse to bow in the dust, and humbly acknowledge, "We are to blame, we have abandoned the first state of the church, and are unable to restore everything; God is faithful; we are to blame.<a name=14:4></a>"

		The writer must allow me to alter a word in his thesis; for without this alteration, the sentence is devoid of force and meaning.<a name=14:5></a> He says, "We must restore everything, as it was in the apostles' time.<a name=14:6></a>" He ought to have said, not we "must," but we "can," restore everything.<a name=14:7></a> For if we cannot do it, our labour is useless.<a name=14:8></a> We know well -- and the Lord be praised for it -- that His grace is fully sufficient, just as much for our low state, as for that of the apostles.<a name=14:9></a> But to what a degree the pretension of such Christians has reached, who ascribe to themselves the ability to restore to its old state whatever the power of the apostles wrought and set up, I leave to the judgment of the reader.<a name=14:10></a> Christians need apostolic power in order to be able to do apostolic works.<a name=14:11></a> They are able by grace to be faithful, amidst the circumstances in which they are found as the result of the continuous power of evil.<a name=14:12></a> They can abandon the evil, but as we have said, to be able to do what the apostles did, they need apostolic power.<a name=14:13></a> Why do they not restore apostles?<a name=14:14></a> why not gifts?<a name=14:15></a> Why not prophets, and miracles?<a name=14:16></a> In fact, to restore everything is a wide field!<a name=14:17></a> Where do we hear in our days words like those of Paul, of Timothy, and of Barnabas?<a name=14:18></a> Where is the power of the Spirit, which in the days of the apostles was so very active?<a name=14:19></a> Paul says, "For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock," Acts 20: 29.<a name=14:20></a> Why such intimations for times after his departure, if others could do everything which he had done?<a name=14:21></a>

		The principles which the writer supposes to be scriptural only help to confound ideas still more; and they betray only too clearly how little people in general seek to inquire what holy Scripture says about God's assembly.<a name=15:1></a> It is clear that Scripture knows only of a general assembly of God.<a name=15:2></a> Christians are regarded as members of the body of Christ.<a name=15:3></a> To be a member of on assembly is a thought of which one finds no trace in the word of God.<a name=15:4></a> And yet this thought forms the basis of the whole system to which the writer addresses himself.<a name=15:5></a> As we are shewn in 1 Corinthians 12, as well as in Ephesians 4 and Romans 12, all gifts were introduced of God not in one fixed and local assembly, but in the <i>whole</i> assembly.<a name=15:6></a> Apollos ministered with his gift as teacher as well in Ephesus as in Corinth, because this gift had been bestowed upon him not for an assembly but for <i>the</i> assembly, and consequently, for the whole body of Christ.<a name=15:7></a> But where do we find in our days anything like the condition portrayed in 1 Corinthians 12?<a name=15:8></a> "Now, that was for apostolic times," our brethren will answer.<a name=15:9></a> But how can they then say, "We must restore everything as it was at the time of the apostles?<a name=15:10></a>" Will they then imitate only outward forms?<a name=15:11></a> That power cannot be imitated, no one will dare to dispute; for one needs the power to be able to exercise it.<a name=15:12></a> But they have not even the form, for to be teacher of an assembly is not scriptural.<a name=15:13></a>

		But how does it stand with the question of elders?<a name=15:14></a> Scripture teaches us that they were not elected by the assemblies.<a name=15:15></a> As we find in Acts 14, Paul and Barnabas "chose them elders"; and of Titus we know that he was sent back to Crete to appoint elders; Titus 1: 5.<a name=15:16></a> Who now could claim the right to do that for which the persons named were divinely authorised?<a name=15:17></a> Where is there now in our days a Paul and a Barnabas, a Timothy and Titus?<a name=15:18></a> Moreover, there still remains the question which settles everything, whether it is in general the will of God to restore all as it was at the time of the apostles.<a name=15:19></a> As we have said, "<i>we must</i>" is without force and meaning if it cannot be supported by a positive "<i>we can</i>.<a name=15:20></a>" Therefore Scripture must decide whether restoration is a thing permitted or required by God.<a name=15:21></a> We deny it.<a name=15:22></a> For "we must" is not scripture; and the writer has in general brought forward no passage for his assertion.<a name=15:23></a> He speaks of a command, but he assigns no command.<a name=15:24></a> Let us examine then the word of God, to see if it does not speak of the results of man's unfaithfulness in respect of the kingdom of God, and His assembly upon the earth.<a name=15:25></a>

		First of all, I would refer briefly to the "Parable of the Tares.<a name=16:1></a>" I find on the part of the writer -- in noticing some thoughts from a tract dealing with this parable -- many hard and bitter expressions, accompanied by the remark: "How much might be said upon this fundamental principle!<a name=16:2></a>" But he neither gives another interpretation of the parable, nor does he seek to refute the "singular" one given, by the citation of even one passage.<a name=16:3></a> But all such shibboleths are powerless, if not founded upon the word of God.<a name=16:4></a>

		Let us turn therefore to the alone infallible word.<a name=16:5></a> The tares are sown by the devil where good seed has been sown by the Lord.<a name=16:6></a> The subject is, of course, not the church itself, but the kingdom.<a name=16:7></a> The field is the world.<a name=16:8></a> But this parable is of great importance if it be a question of the restoration of the good state of Christianity.<a name=16:9></a> The question of the servants, if they should root up the tares, the Lord answers in the negative with the words: "Let both grow together until the harvest.<a name=16:10></a>" A restoration of the earlier state is not prescribed, and consequently is impossible.<a name=16:11></a> The judgment alone will deal with it.<a name=16:12></a> But someone might object, "Why do you not remain in the state-church?<a name=16:13></a>" I answer: Because Scripture knows of no state-church, but only of the church, and because it expressly says, that in the last perilous days everything will demonstrate the ruin, and men have the form of godliness but deny the power thereof.<a name=16:14></a> "From such turn away," says the apostle; and thus in following the divine exhortation and turning away, I act in obedience, even if I remain alone.<a name=16:15></a> But why, it might be further asked, since everything is not to be restored, do you not remain alone?<a name=16:16></a> and I bring forward in reply 2 Timothy 2, where I am taught that, since the Lord knows His own in spite of the confusion in the last days, I am not only to depart from iniquity, but to walk with those who "call upon the Lord out of a pure heart" (verse 19, 22); whilst at the same time I possess the precious and comforting promise: "Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them," Matthew 18: 20.<a name=16:17></a> So saith the Scripture.<a name=16:18></a> And if now I order my course according to these divine directions, the pretension to wish to restore everything is in no wise hidden therein; but with thankful heart I make use of the instructions which God has given for the last days in His precious word, in individual obedience.<a name=16:19></a>

		As a whole, the passage quoted enlightens us clearly as to whether a restoration will take place in the last days.<a name=17:1></a> But "this know also," says the apostle, "that in the last days perilous times shall come," 2 Timothy 3: 1.<a name=17:2></a> Then follows (verse 2-5) a picture of the sad state of Christendom, become like heathenism.<a name=17:3></a> (Compare Rom 1.<a name=17:4></a> with 2 Timothy 3.<a name=17:5></a>) Will the church then, not be roused again out of this state?<a name=17:6></a> No: it will grow worse and worse (verse 13).<a name=17:7></a> There is not a trace of restoration.<a name=17:8></a> In 2 Thessalonians 2 we see that the apostasy comes, and the man of sin, the son of perdition, shall be revealed (verse 3).<a name=17:9></a> Will the apostasy have an end, or the man of sin be removed, by the renewed power of the gospel?<a name=17:10></a> By no means.<a name=17:11></a> Already in the time of the apostle, the mystery of lawlessness was at work.<a name=17:12></a> And this fire, smouldering in ashes, has developed -- "worse and worse," as the apostle foresaw, and will not be stayed until, as soon as every hindrance is taken out of the way, the lawless one shall be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of His mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of His coming (verse 7, 8).<a name=17:13></a> There is nowhere a thought of restoration.<a name=17:14></a> Jude also teaches the same truth.<a name=17:15></a> In his epistle we see that false brethren had crept in, of whom Enoch had prophesied: "Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints," .<a name=17:16></a>.<a name=17:17></a>.<a name=17:18></a> (verse 14).<a name=17:19></a> They go the way of Cain, give themselves for reward to the error of Balaam, and perish in the gainsaying of Korah (verse 11).<a name=17:20></a> That is the character of the evil in the last days, which already had begun in the days of the apostles.<a name=17:21></a> For in 1 John 2: 18, we read, "Little children, it is the last time, and as ye have heard that Antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.<a name=17:22></a>" Already, then, as Peter teaches, the time of the judgment of God's house had come; 1 Peter 4: 17.<a name=17:23></a> In short, everywhere we find testimony to the apostasy, and nowhere 8 word of restoration, although in the days of the apostles the principles of evil and apostasy had already penetrated into the church.<a name=17:24></a>

		It may perhaps be asked, "Shall not the world then be filled with the knowledge of the Lord by the gospel of <i>grace</i>?<a name=18:1></a>" No.<a name=18:2></a> The gospel of the <i>kingdom</i> will indeed be preached amongst all nations, but then will the end come; Matthew 24: 14 "The <i>everlasting</i> gospel" will be sent to every nation and every kindred and every tongue, with the announcement: "Fear God and give glory to him, for the hour of his judgment is come," Revelation 14: 6, 7.<a name=18:3></a> Then follows the destruction of Babylon, and finally the appearing of the Son of man on the cloud.<a name=18:4></a> But then, will not the world generally be filled with the knowledge of the Lord?<a name=18:5></a> Certainly.<a name=18:6></a> But how?<a name=18:7></a> By the gospel of grace?<a name=18:8></a> Not at all.<a name=18:9></a> There are three passages in holy Scripture in which mention is made of this subject: Numbers 14: 21, Isaiah 11, Habakkuk 2: 12-14.<a name=18:10></a> But none of these passages speak of grace: all speak of judgment; and in Isaiah 26: 9, 10, it is declared definitively that the inhabitants of the earth will learn righteousness when the judgments of God are in the earth; but that, though favour be shewn to the wicked, "they will not learn righteousness.<a name=18:11></a>" The reader will also see in Isaiah 25: 7-9, that at the time when the veil that is spread over all nations is removed, the resurrection has taken place, and the Jewish people is restored in blessing.<a name=18:12></a>

		It is therefore a lack of spiritual understanding, and is nothing short of disobedience, to desire to restore everything, since for such a work there is not only no command, but Holy Scripture teaches exactly the reverse.<a name=18:13></a> It is not obedience to content oneself with Christian parties, because Scripture condemns them; it is not obedience to form a so-called church, and to be a member of it, because Scripture knows only of members of <i>the</i> church, as the body of Christ, but not members of a church calling itself so-and-so; it is not obedience to elect or appoint elders, because in the New Testament this was never the act of the churches; it is not obedience to institute an office of preachers because Scripture knows nothing of such an office, but speaks only of gifts which God bestowed, with which to serve the whole church.<a name=18:14></a> But it is obedience to keep aloof from a Christianity which has the form of godliness but denies the power, because Scripture in 2 Timothy 3 expressly exhorts us to do so; and it is obedience to assemble ourselves with those who call upon the Lord out of a pure heart (2 Timothy 2), and not to neglect the assembling of ourselves together, because Scripture enjoins it, and promises the precious and blessed presence of the Lord to all those who gather in His name.<a name=18:15></a>

		But let us probe the question.<a name=20:15></a> I shall bring to light some facts, and then speak of the principles.<a name=20:16></a> Mr.<a name=20:17></a> O.<a name=20:18></a> says: "All I know, is, that some of those who had held with him (Mr.<a name=20:19></a> N.<a name=20:20></a>) were admitted to the Lord's supper, at the church called Bethesda.<a name=20:21></a> For this the whole assembly of Bethesda were excommunicated.<a name=20:22></a>" If Mr.<a name=20:23></a> O.<a name=20:24></a> only knows this, he knows very little, and would have done better not to speak of it.<a name=20:25></a> It appears that Mr.<a name=20:26></a> O.<a name=20:27></a>, while saying all he can for Mr.<a name=20:28></a> N.<a name=20:29></a>, considers his doctrines such, that the Lord's table must be denied, not only to the one who teaches them, but to those who are drawn away by him.<a name=20:30></a> He says that, on his own authority, he declared to a young sister, by letter, dated 21st May, 1867, that she could not break bread with the worship-meeting of the Rue du Lac, although she had said she did not admit the doctrine, which, however, Mr.<a name=20:31></a> N.<a name=20:32></a> taught in his tracts, which tracts she could not disavow, as she did not think their author could be mistaken in anything.<a name=20:33></a> If a poor victim of his influence, <i>who does not admit his doctrine</i>, must be rejected, we surely were right in rejecting the one who wrote the tracts, and boldly maintained blasphemies.<a name=20:34></a> Neither is it true that Mr.<a name=20:35></a> N.<a name=20:36></a> did not want to "weaken propitiation.<a name=20:37></a>" Mr.<a name=20:38></a> N.<a name=20:39></a> said the death of Christ was only an incident of the life of Christ.<a name=20:40></a> This expression was taken up.<a name=20:41></a> To excuse himself, he said he was accustomed to use the word 'incident' in a special sense, and not as others employ it.<a name=20:42></a> But he also said that Christ suffered far more before the coming of John the Baptist than after; that, on hearing the gospel from John the Baptist's lips, He passed from being under law to being under grace.<a name=20:43></a>

		Now this is how the Bethesda meeting got involved in the question.<a name=21:4></a> A lady, who liked Mr.<a name=21:5></a> N.<a name=21:6></a>'s teaching, left the Bath meeting when he was no longer allowed to preach there.<a name=21:7></a> She was at once surreptitiously brought into Bethesda.<a name=21:8></a> Then seven persons of the chapel and meeting of Mr.<a name=21:9></a> N.<a name=21:10></a> were received at Bethesda, some of whom agreed fully with his doctrine.<a name=21:11></a> Some pious brethren in Bethesda protested, and entreated Messrs.<a name=21:12></a> Muller and Craik, the two pastors, to examine the doctrine, and not to let persons from Mr.<a name=21:13></a> N.<a name=21:14></a>'s meeting in, without having first subjected them to an examination.<a name=21:15></a> They refused, and several meetings were held, and a letter was signed by the ten elders, or labourers, of the assembly, declaring that they would not do it, and that it was a new test of communion to examine them on this point; and Messrs.<a name=21:16></a> M.<a name=21:17></a> and C.<a name=21:18></a> asserted that they must be justified, on that ground, according to the principles of this document (called the letter of the ten), otherwise they would cease to be the pastors of the assembly, and they got the whole meeting to vote, by rising, and sitting, so that the whole meeting, as a meeting, justified the admission of persons whom Mr.<a name=21:19></a> O.<a name=21:20></a> would exclude.<a name=21:21></a> This letter remains in force to this day.<a name=21:22></a> Not long ago, Mr.<a name=21:23></a> M.<a name=21:24></a> refused to withdraw it, on being requested so to do.<a name=21:25></a>

		Now, why should I separate from the people at Plymouth, and be in fellowship with them at Bristol?<a name=21:26></a> But what is of importance to note, is, that the meeting voted that it was not necessary to examine if Christ was thus blasphemed, or not.<a name=21:27></a> The fact is that Mr.<a name=21:28></a> C.<a name=21:29></a> favoured the doctrine, and taught, in great measure, the same errors.<a name=21:30></a> It is not a question of excommunicating an assembly.<a name=21:31></a> It is individuals that are excommunicated.<a name=21:32></a> One separates from an assembly, and this is what was done with regard to Bethesda; but the individuals coming from a meeting which has, as a meeting, received the evil into its bosom, may be guilty of the act, and responsible for what the assembly has done.<a name=21:33></a> Thus, when the meeting voted the acceptance of the letter of the ten, and a good number of Christians had separated from it, because, in reality, they had voted that they would not, and should not, examine whether to accept blasphemy against the Lord, when, to say the least, it was habitually heard -- when the members of the assembly had voted that indifference to blasphemy was a good thing, were the individuals not all under responsibility for the action of the assembly?<a name=21:34></a> There was no question of whether the individuals held the doctrine, or not.<a name=21:35></a> (The young person excluded by Mr.<a name=21:36></a> O.<a name=21:37></a> did not admit Mr.<a name=21:38></a> N.<a name=21:39></a>'s doctrine; like Bethesda, she did not disavow his tracts.<a name=21:40></a>) The assembly had taken the ground of indifference to blasphemy against Christ, and the persons constituting the assembly (save in the case of real ignorance as to the facts) were defiled with the defilement of the assembly.<a name=21:41></a> This is the doctrine of Scripture: "Ye have approved <i>yourselves</i> to be clear in this matter"; they were not incestuous, but, as long as incest was permitted, the assembly was guilty of it, and was not clear of it, neither were the individuals composing it.<a name=21:42></a> So the apostle says: "Purge out, therefore, the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump.<a name=21:43></a>" Therefore they were not a new lump, unless they purged out the old leaven.<a name=21:44></a> The assembly, and those composing it, were old leaven, unfit to celebrate the feast.<a name=21:45></a> But all the assemblies of God are jointly responsible; and, whether God's assembly, or not, an assembly which chooses to accept the principles of fellowship with Bethesda is identified, has identified itself, with Bethesda.<a name=21:46></a>

		A distance of twenty, or two hundred, leagues does not alter the moral fact in anything; in what is moral, space is of no account.<a name=22:1></a> If an assembly, knowingly and wilfully, accepts fellowship with Bethesda, it is defiled, as Bethesda is -- it accepts the principle of indifference to blasphemy against Christ.<a name=22:2></a> Some meetings invited Mr.<a name=22:3></a> N.<a name=22:4></a>; in some neutral gatherings influential persons went to Bethesda for the purpose of testimony; and some have boldly avowed their opinion, and published, with their names attached thereto, tracts, advocating the principle of Mr.<a name=22:5></a> B.<a name=22:6></a> cited by Mr.<a name=22:7></a> O.<a name=22:8></a>, namely, that if an assembly permits fornication, the assembly cannot be defiled by it, but only the guilty person.<a name=22:9></a> Now, I do not consider blasphemies against the Lord less serious, if less shocking, than moral corruption; yet the principle, that an assembly cannot be defiled, is taught by several tracts on their side.<a name=22:10></a> Now, it is all the same, if there are two, or two hundred, meetings consecutively; it is only throwing dust in the eyes.<a name=22:11></a> This is the question: Has such and such an assembly identified itself with the impure principle that wishes the evil to be admitted?<a name=22:12></a> As I have already said, in America the question was not Bethesda, but non-eternity of punishment.<a name=22:13></a> The question which I here state is all the more important, since, in these last days, the principle on which we have to meet, is, separation from evil.<a name=22:14></a> The second and third chapters of 2 Timothy are clear on this point.<a name=22:15></a>

		Now, as regards the principles of gathering of the children of God in these times, it is well to notice that Mr.<a name=23:1></a> O.<a name=23:2></a> frankly admits that he does not profess to meet on the principles laid down in Scripture -- on pages 31 to 33 he declares it.<a name=23:3></a> I only quote two sentences.<a name=23:4></a> "The principle asserted is that of the primitive church, but can it be the principle of the dismembered church?<a name=23:5></a>" That is the question.<a name=23:6></a> Then (page 46) "Mr.<a name=23:7></a> D.<a name=23:8></a> professes to be able to realise today what was the principle of the unity of the church when the church was one; whereas, I consider that this principle is, nowadays, quite impracticable.<a name=23:9></a>" He wants a principle in the air, deprived of its substructure.<a name=23:10></a> Now it is certain that God's word knows of none other, and has no two principles of gathering.<a name=23:11></a> We say, the word must be reverted to, and, whatever our low condition, we must go by the word, where we find what may be applied to the present time.<a name=23:12></a> Now, to gather two or three in the name <i>of</i> Jesus belongs to all times.<a name=23:13></a> If Mr.<a name=23:14></a> O.<a name=23:15></a> cannot meet on scriptural principles -- and this he admits -- then his meeting is merely a human meeting, on human principles; if it is not on the principle <i>of</i> the unity <i>of</i> the church, it is independent churches.<a name=23:16></a>

		What is not within the unity is, by the very principle <i>of</i> its existence, outside it.<a name=23:17></a> Here is what Mr.<a name=23:18></a> O.<a name=23:19></a> says: "This is the problem to be solved: to find a means of constructing worship-meetings which depart as little as possible from the notion of the unity of the church, and which, at the same time, permit of a connection subsisting with the dismembered church.<a name=23:20></a>" One cannot act on the recognised primitive and scriptural principle, that is, the principle owned of God, and one must depart as little as possible from it.<a name=23:21></a> And who is to be the judge whether the departure is to an allowable degree, or not?<a name=23:22></a> And if the gathering is not on the scriptural principle -- that is to say, that which alone has God's authority -- each one is free to select the principle he chooses to meet on.<a name=23:23></a> "The dismemberment rules everything"; that is to say, the effect of man's sin liberates us from the duty of returning to the word and the will of God.<a name=23:24></a> Impossible to have a more distinct admission of his having abandoned the principle of God's word, than what is found in the pages I have indicated.<a name=23:25></a> When this is once done, <i>God's authority is null and void</i>.<a name=23:26></a> A little, more or less, departure is, comparatively speaking, indifferent.<a name=23:27></a> The principle is not a divine one.<a name=23:28></a> Let this avowal be well weighed.<a name=23:29></a> If it is impossible to meet according to the Word, better not meet at all.<a name=23:30></a> We believe God is faithful to His children.<a name=23:31></a> The Lord has a flock, and He has given in His word what is appropriate to all times.<a name=23:32></a> Here it must be explained.<a name=23:33></a> Mr.<a name=23:34></a> O.<a name=23:35></a> would have us profess to re-establish the primitive unity of all Christians as a whole.<a name=23:36></a> But it is not so.<a name=23:37></a> I hope there will be much more seen, and I do not think the thing is complete.<a name=23:38></a> This ought to be.<a name=23:39></a> I doubt whether unity will be re-established in an absolute way.<a name=23:40></a> But that is not the question for us.<a name=23:41></a> What God will do is not our rule of conduct, but what He wants us to do, what is found in His word.<a name=23:42></a> There is a great system where the form of godliness is found, the power of it being denied.<a name=23:43></a> I ought to separate from it.<a name=23:44></a> I do so.<a name=23:45></a> Other Christians are unwilling to do so.<a name=23:46></a> I must leave them, and follow the Word.<a name=23:47></a> Also, as regards details, I name the name of Christ; I must depart from iniquity, and I do so, wherever it may be.<a name=23:48></a> Then, in a great house, there are false teachers; I purge myself from these, and follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.<a name=23:49></a>

		As for the passage out of Clement,<a href="#29:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> Mr.<a name=29:1></a> O.<a name=29:2></a>'s remark leads me to the belief that he never thoroughly examined the passage, otherwise I should have to accuse him of insincerity, which I have no desire to do.<a name=29:3></a> It is impossible for him to have examined the passage, without coming across a word acknowledged by all as difficult, which, in reality, presents no difficulty, and for the sense of which one might even have done without Alexandre non-revised.<a name=29:4></a> I did not name the difficult word, and I spoke of another word with quite another object, as everybody can see.<a name=29:5></a> But if Mr.<a name=29:6></a> O.<a name=29:7></a> had looked up the passage, he would have seen it.<a name=29:8></a> Now, I suppose that the eleventh edition of Alexandre, and certainly Stephanus, Pape, etc.<a name=29:9></a>, will give it a sense which is impossible to apply to its use by Clement, and no other, and he will find but little more than I have said of it in my pamphlet, except that, I think, they quote Aelian also.<a name=29:10></a> Let us see if Mr.<a name=29:11></a> O.<a name=29:12></a> can enlighten us further as to its force.<a name=29:13></a> Such may well be.<a name=29:14></a> As for me, I have no time to make deeper researches, but I can only think, that, if he had searched the original, he would at least have encountered the difficulty.<a name=29:15></a>

		To sum up, here is what is stated in the pamphlet that I have examined.<a name=29:16></a> By Mr.<a name=29:17></a> O.<a name=29:18></a>'s admission, the meetings he would like to establish are not set up on scriptural principles.<a name=29:19></a> The principle we follow, Mr.<a name=29:20></a> O.<a name=29:21></a> himself admits is the one recognised by the word, and which governed the path of the church as God established it, but it is impracticable, he says, to act on this principle at present.<a name=29:22></a> Having abandoned the principle of the unity of the church, he cannot meet on the principle of this unity.<a name=29:23></a> That is impracticable, and he forms independent churches, which respect one another, and mutually accept each other's discipline from each other, provided it be judged expedient, otherwise not.<a name=29:24></a> This is not the discipline of the church according to the promised presence of the Lord, but the discipline of a voluntary association, accepted, or not, according to circumstances.<a name=29:25></a> An assembly may admit sin or blasphemy, and the <i>assembly</i> not be defiled; the one who committed the sin is guilty; those who accepted him, and remained in fellowship with him, are clear of all defilement.<a name=29:26></a> Then the minister may exclude on his own authority.<a name=29:27></a> I admit that Mr.<a name=29:28></a> B.<a name=29:29></a> did not speak of the permission of sin in an assembly; he tries, as all the Bethesdaites, to hide facts under their common formula.<a name=29:30></a> "If there is a wicked person in an assembly," then this story of defilement communicated by one assembly to another; but it is only hiding facts; but the point is, when the matter, being done wittingly -- the sin, or blasphemy, knowingly and voluntarily admitted -- whether the assembly is defiled, or not.<a name=29:31></a> Mr.<a name=29:32></a> O.<a name=29:33></a>'s system would entail the consequence that I might participate in the exclusion of a wicked person in one meeting, and take the Lord's supper with him in another.<a name=29:34></a>

		IS THE "ONE BODY" THE GROUND OF GATHERING?
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Is the 'one body' of Ephesians 4: 4 the divinely constituted ground of gathering?<a name=31:1></a>" A small paper with this title has been sent to me, signed C.<a name=31:2></a> E.<a name=31:3></a>, initials with which I am not acquainted.<a name=31:4></a> The reply is very simple.<a name=31:5></a> It is.<a name=31:6></a> A very little attention to the passage itself and others which I shall cite, will prove it to every spiritual mind.<a name=31:7></a> It is, Christ being the centre and head, the great principle of gathering which has been the basis of those called Brethren, and has governed at any rate those of them intelligent in God's ways from the beginning.<a name=31:8></a> I add intelligent, because a person may be recently converted, and be sealed and of the body and so have title to be there, though his knowledge be defective.<a name=31:9></a> I shall quote a few passages to shew this point very quickly, profiting by the attack made upon the principle, to keep the point before the minds of Christians, which it is always profitable to do.<a name=31:10></a> As to making it clear and proving it, it has been done, not only in tracts drawn from Scripture, but in discussions with Christians of various phases, National and Free Church, since it came up, and dissenters of all classes, mostly, but not exclusively so, in Switzerland some thirty years ago or more, but translated most or all of them, into English.<a name=31:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is clear that the perfection of the body of Christ, united to the Head, will be in glory.<a name=31:12></a> This has been contested, however, on the plea that Scripture never speaks but of the body on earth.<a name=31:13></a> But it seems to me that the end of Ephesians 1 clearly teaches the supremacy of Christ over all things as Head of the body, as the counsel of God in this respect.<a name=31:14></a> That was one extreme;<a href="#31:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> the other is, that the unity of the body is not on earth, but only in heaven.<a name=31:15></a>

		The tract confounds the kingdom with the church, quoting Matthew 13, as to tares being among the wheat.<a name=31:16></a> But this would deny all discipline; both are to grow together till the harvest.<a name=31:17></a> Final judgment would be the only putting out.<a name=31:18></a> This I may dismiss.<a name=31:19></a> It is simple nationalism or popery, no present gathering of saints at all.<a name=31:20></a>

		It also confounds the house and husbandry of 1 Corinthians 3 with the body, which is not spoken of at all.<a name=32:1></a> We have a temple, that is, where God dwells, but in which there is no union with Him who dwells there.<a name=32:2></a> Here we have three cases.<a name=32:3></a> He who builds with God's materials; he who, himself a saint, builds with bad, and loses his labour; and he who seeks to corrupt and will be destroyed; but no thought of the body.<a name=32:4></a> The writer tells us the word <i>church</i>, or <i>assembly</i>, denotes in their collective character those who profess to have obtained salvation, as when Paul addresses his epistle to the church of God which is at Corinth.<a name=32:5></a> The example is an unhappy one, because the apostle states what he means by the church, and makes the difference of those who profess, though these are assumed to be genuine unless proved otherwise.<a name=32:6></a> The address of the apostle is as follows: "To the church of God, which is at Corinth, the sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of the Lord Jesus.<a name=32:7></a>" That is, universal profession and sanctified ones are clearly distinguished, the former looked at as composing the assembly at Corinth, and that by God's calling.<a name=32:8></a> And the difference is maintained in the epistle; it is only in chapter 10 that the apostle comes to speak of the body.<a name=32:9></a>

		Again we are told that in Acts 20, Paul speaks of grievous wolves entering into the church.<a name=32:10></a> Nothing of the kind.<a name=32:11></a> The church of God spoken of, is what is purchased with His own blood, I suppose the true church which belongs to Christ for ever, and which He will present to Himself.<a name=32:12></a> All we have is, that wolves would not spare the flock, from which true members of Christ might suffer, if they could not be lost.<a name=32:13></a> I suppose, feeding God's assembly was on earth, yet it is viewed as purchased by the blood of Christ.<a name=32:14></a> Now the church or assembly of God, here, though set up in perfection by God, was, as man, as Israel, as everything God has set up, placed under man's responsibility; and man, as he has already done and that the first thing, has failed.<a name=32:15></a> But that failure was not the principle on which it was set up, any more than sin was the principle of man's standing in creation, nor disobedience and idolatry the principle of Israel's standing under Sinai.<a name=32:16></a> In each case it was man spoiling what God had set up.<a name=32:17></a> Even in Matthew 13 (which I do not refer to as the church) it was an enemy's doing, while men slept.<a name=32:18></a> The opposite doctrine is what Jeremiah so sternly denounces: "We are delivered to do all these abominations.<a name=32:19></a>" What the Lord did is clearly stated, Acts 2: 47, "The Lord added daily such as should be saved.<a name=32:20></a>"

		Why does Paul say in the passage on which C.<a name=33:1></a> E.<a name=33:2></a> relies, "after my decease," but to shew that spiritual energy preserved what God had set up, as long as it was there?<a name=33:3></a> C.<a name=33:4></a> E.<a name=33:5></a> with his independent churches, and others, and I holding the unity of the body, all believe that the church on earth has been corrupted, and that in the last days perilous times would come.<a name=33:6></a> That is not the question; but, is that corruption part of the divine principle of meeting, or a corruption which makes us guilty?<a name=33:7></a> Is it a part of the divine intention or man's fault?<a name=33:8></a> What I find in Scripture, in the seven churches C.<a name=33:9></a> E.<a name=33:10></a> refers to, is, that it ends in the terrible judgments of Thyatira, and being spued out of Christ's mouth as nauseous to Him, and the threat of judgment if they did not repent so soon as they left their first works.<a name=33:11></a> But what the author cites of Jude teaches us the same truth; certain men had "crept in unawares"; but creeping in unawares was not the principle upon which the saints were gathered, was not accepted as the order of the place.<a name=33:12></a> They were spots in their feasts of charity, feasting with those among whom they had crept.<a name=33:13></a> Enoch had prophesied of them.<a name=33:14></a> Nothing can be clearer than that they had nothing to do -- their being there had nothing to do -- with the principle of the gathering; they had crept in.<a name=33:15></a> Jude writes to them that are sanctified by God the Father.<a name=33:16></a> In John they were not in the assembly at all, but antichrists who had been in it, and were to be manifested that they were not of it.<a name=33:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another objection, which is not new to me, is more plausible, and goes upon a certain borrowed acquaintance with Scripture, namely, that the unity of the body was not known till Paul taught it.<a name=33:18></a> Now, there was a time of transition of God's patience with the Jews, and Paul, called specially out to be the minister of the Gentiles, was the instrument in God's hands for unfolding the mystery of the union of Jews and Gentiles on the same footing.<a name=33:19></a> But God took care that it should not be a new, separate thing in its nature and essence.<a name=33:20></a> After Paul was called he was not allowed to begin the introduction of the Gentiles, and Peter insisted on this in Acts 15.<a name=33:21></a> He, not Paul, was the means of introducing Cornelius, and C.<a name=33:22></a> E.<a name=33:23></a> confounds the existence of the thing and the development of the doctrine.<a name=33:24></a> Paul was the great instrument, both of promulgating the doctrine, and carrying it out in practice; a dispensation was committed to him.<a name=33:25></a> But God graciously took care to guard against the mistake of C.<a name=33:26></a> E.<a name=33:27></a> by employing Peter to begin publicly that work as a fact, and securing its stability by not allowing Paul to make good at Antioch the truth he had received; and the church remained one from the beginning.<a name=33:28></a> But what is its essence is much more important.<a name=33:29></a> The union of the body subsists from the day of Pentecost.<a name=33:30></a> It was established as to Gentiles, before Paul's ministry, at Caesarea in the bright and godly centurion, and Paul, in God's wisdom, was not allowed to secure it among the Gentiles.<a name=33:31></a> That was to be done (where it was important to do it) among the Jews at Jerusalem.<a name=33:32></a> No doubt the union of Jew and Gentile was of importance, especially in those days; but it was not the essential principle of the body or its unity.<a name=33:33></a> That was union with Christ, the Head, by the Holy Ghost.<a name=33:34></a> That was what made the body and unity, and each Christian, so sealed, a member of Christ.<a name=33:35></a>

		Was there no body of Christ till Paul spoke about the mystery?<a name=34:1></a> Yet, if the confusion made by C.<a name=34:2></a> E.<a name=34:3></a> between the existence of the body, and the knowledge of the mystery be accepted, there could not have been.<a name=34:4></a> Thousands have come into communion amongst those whom C.<a name=34:5></a> E.<a name=34:6></a> attacks, who know nothing but to cry Abba, Father, as sealed with the Spirit, and learn the mystery there.<a name=34:7></a> It is much to be desired that they should be intelligent as to it, and that they should know the place they are in.<a name=34:8></a> But I never heard of such being a term for communion.<a name=34:9></a> I suspect a very large number would have to be put out.<a name=34:10></a> That it is as such the assembly meets, that the truth as to this is found in tracts and writings, is quite true.<a name=34:11></a> The writer does not mean to say that we should meet as if there were two churches of God on earth.<a name=34:12></a> Meeting on that principle, as an expression in common use, means quite a different thing.<a name=34:13></a> We cannot meet as being the one assembly, because a great number of Christians are outside of us, but we meet on the principle of that unity.<a name=34:14></a> It is this unity of the whole body on earth which C.<a name=34:15></a> E.<a name=34:16></a> denies.<a name=34:17></a> What a new believer is introduced into, is that unity which unquestionably existed in the beginning, and which we seek to realise as far as we can.<a name=34:18></a> Supposing I was to say that we meet on the principle that holiness becomes God's house.<a name=34:19></a> C.<a name=34:20></a> E.<a name=34:21></a> seems hardly to think so, but who would say that could not be the bond of union?<a name=34:22></a> Unity with the Head by the Holy Ghost is the only bond of union, but that produces the unity of the body of which we are thus all members.<a name=34:23></a> We meet with the conviction that the gathered saints were at the beginning the body of Christ, and members one of another, and as such all one on earth (does C.<a name=34:24></a> E.<a name=34:25></a> mean to say they were not?<a name=34:26></a>), and that we ought to seek to realise it.<a name=34:27></a> To be of the assembly as having the Holy Ghost, and to understand and explain it, are two things; to deny it, which is C.<a name=34:28></a> E.<a name=34:29></a>'s place, is a third.<a name=34:30></a> But his statement goes further.<a name=34:31></a> God formed the church -- for it began down here -- on the ground, according to his system, of there being evil in it, tares.<a name=34:32></a> They hold the church met on that principle; not that men crept in unawares, but that it is the principle they are united on.<a name=34:33></a> Now holiness is not what binds us, nor the principle of unity, yet the assembly meets as composed of those who are sanctified, called saints, sanctified in Christ Jesus, on that principle, and as all one (<i>all</i> saints are one body), and we seek to realise it as far as we can.<a name=34:34></a> The principle or ground of gathering is that of all saints being one in Christ, and as such forming the one church of God on earth.<a name=34:35></a> Christians had lost this principle, and it has been recovered; hence much, and rightly, put forward.<a name=34:36></a>

		I shall now shew, that what Scripture presents to us is a body on earth, formed on earth as Christ's body, the Head being in heaven, by the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven.<a name=35:1></a> Let my reader look at 1 Corinthians 12: 12 to the end.<a name=35:2></a> It is perfectly impossible for a man in his senses not to recognise a body on earth.<a name=35:3></a> The apostle compares it to our natural body: we have body and members, and all the members of that one body being many are one body; the body is not one member, but many.<a name=35:4></a> But C.<a name=35:5></a> E.<a name=35:6></a> will say that this is in heaven.<a name=35:7></a> But, unfortunately, it is by one Spirit we are baptised into one body: now this was on earth.<a name=35:8></a> "Ye shall be baptised with the Holy Ghost, not many days hence.<a name=35:9></a>" They were to tarry at Jerusalem for the power of the Holy Ghost coming upon them.<a name=35:10></a> It was one of the two great characters of Christ's work.<a name=35:11></a> He it is that baptised with the Holy Ghost.<a name=35:12></a> The Spirit of God came down to earth and formed one body before Paul was called.<a name=35:13></a> If anything need be added, it is found here, verse 25: and there was to be no schism in the body, the members were all to have the same care one for another; if one member suffered, all the members suffered with it, or one member were honoured, all the members rejoiced with it.<a name=35:14></a> "Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular; and God hath set some in the church, etc .<a name=35:15></a>.<a name=35:16></a>.<a name=35:17></a> .<a name=35:18></a>" Will C.<a name=35:19></a> E.<a name=35:20></a> tell me which of these gifts are to be exercised in heaven?<a name=35:21></a> The whole passage is as clear as language can make it, that there is a body on earth formed by the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven, and recognised on earth with these words, "so also is Christ.<a name=35:22></a>" Chapter 10: 17 does not refer to the connection of the heathen with idols, or Jews with the altar.<a name=35:23></a> It is used in reference to this as the basis of the argument.<a name=35:24></a> "<i>For</i> we, being many, are one bread, and one body; for we are all partakers of that one bread.<a name=35:25></a>" The same principle is recognised as known truth in Romans 12, "For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office; so we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.<a name=35:26></a>" And all that follows applies to the saints down here exclusively.<a name=35:27></a> It is <i>now</i> (Ephesians 3: 10) that the manifold wisdom is to be made known by the church to principalities and powers in heavenly places, the Gentiles being a joint body.<a name=35:28></a> So in chapter 4, the very verse cited by C.<a name=35:29></a> E.<a name=35:30></a> It is exhortation to us now to endeavour to keep the unity of the Spirit, and what we are called to is still a hope, as the verse itself says.<a name=35:31></a> It will be said, "But the hope of the calling is glory with Christ above.<a name=35:32></a>" Undoubtedly, but it will then have ceased to be a hope; it is when we have been called and have it as a hope (for we are saved in hope) that there is one body and one Spirit; there is that, as there is one faith and one baptism.<a name=35:33></a> The whole passage plainly shews that it is the present time, the time when the Spirit is personally down here, and faith has its place -- hence the apostle speaks of the edifying of the body of Christ, "<i>till</i> we all come," etc.<a name=35:34></a> Hence C.<a name=35:35></a> E.<a name=35:36></a> cannot speak so; He has given these ministries, not for the edifying of the body, as Scripture speaks, but "the members of His body on earth.<a name=35:37></a>" He has lost the great truth, that God has revived in these last days that presence of the Holy Ghost <i>down here</i>.<a name=35:38></a> He confounds the kingdom of heaven with the church and the body of Christ, and so will have tares in it, and tares to remain in it till harvest.<a name=35:39></a> In Scripture, "an enemy has done it.<a name=35:40></a>"

		I find in this same passage, Ephesians 4: 15, 16, "Speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things which is the head, even Christ; from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.<a name=36:1></a>" A husband is to love his wife as the Lord loves and cherishes the church, for we are members of His body.<a name=36:2></a> The only other passages, as far as I am aware, are Colossians 1: 18, and 3: 15.<a name=36:3></a> The former does not help us one way or the other, saying Christ is the head of the body, save as far as shewing, a remark that has its importance, that the apostle does not make the difference C.<a name=36:4></a> E.<a name=36:5></a> does.<a name=36:6></a> The latter passage clearly applies to earth as a present exhortation to peace; it shews clearly, as I said, that as to the unity of the body the apostle makes no distinction between the calling of God in its responsible effectuation now, and its sure divine effectuation when all is complete in result.<a name=36:7></a> There is one passage which speaks of it in this result, that is, takes in this view, Ephesians 1: 22, 23, but even so -- looks at the church as an existing thing.<a name=36:8></a> I have not to complain of the spirit in which the leaflet is written, but I am surprised in realising the complete loss of truth by those to whom the writer belongs.<a name=36:9></a>

		I add a few supplementary words, to shew how this evil system destroys the whole idea of the church of God.<a name=37:1></a> First I would remark, that Christ gave Himself to gather together in one the children of God which were scattered abroad.<a name=37:2></a> Now I admit that this is not properly the body.<a name=37:3></a> John never speaks of the body.<a name=37:4></a> But it is unity, and it is down here, for those who were scattered will all be one any way up in heaven.<a name=37:5></a> Their being scattered abroad down here makes no difference as to that; there is no scattering there; yet whereas they were scattered, they were now to be gathered.<a name=37:6></a> This unity is ignored by C.<a name=37:7></a> E.<a name=37:8></a> The word 'church,' says C.<a name=37:9></a> E.<a name=37:10></a>, denotes in their collective character those who profess, whereas in Scripture it is certainly not so at the founding of Christianity.<a name=37:11></a> There the Lord added daily<a href="#37:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> such as should be saved.<a name=37:12></a> Further, who added?<a name=37:13></a> The Lord.<a name=37:14></a> Did He add mere professors?<a name=37:15></a> That such crept in ere many years were past we know.<a name=37:16></a> So later, "As many as were ordained to eternal life believed.<a name=37:17></a>" C.<a name=37:18></a> E.<a name=37:19></a> does not believe in a divine gathering at all at any time.<a name=37:20></a> God does not gather professors.<a name=37:21></a> And here the language is not quite honest.<a name=37:22></a> The writer says: "they (who profess to have obtained salvation) compose the assembly or assemblies.<a name=37:23></a>" Which?<a name=37:24></a> for they are not the same thing.<a name=37:25></a> Hence the assembly is slipped out directly, and we read, "the church of God which is in Corinth," "the seven churches in Asia.<a name=37:26></a>" Hence we read (page 3) that Christ, in His love and care for the members of His body on earth, provides for their edification, through various ministries and gifts of the Holy Ghost.<a name=37:27></a> But this does not alter the character of the assembly, whether in Corinth or Ephesus.<a name=37:28></a> He then speaks of evangelists as having their service outside the assembly, while gifts of healing were intended to meet the physical needs of men as men.<a name=37:29></a> All very well if we do not go to Scripture, but the assembly is wholly lost, save to say that the service of the evangelist is outside it.<a name=37:30></a> But where <i>were</i> the gifts, whether their service were in or out of the assembly, or for men as men?<a name=37:31></a> Here is the answer of Scripture: "Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular; and God hath set some in the church, first, apostles; secondarily, prophets; thirdly, teachers; after that, miracles; then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues," not all in <i>a</i> church, but in <i>the</i> church -- the assembly.<a name=37:32></a> Nothing can be more clear or definite.<a name=37:33></a> Evangelists are not there.<a name=37:34></a> The gifts are viewed simply as the power of the Spirit.<a name=37:35></a> In Ephesians 4 we find only gifts of edification, and they are attributed to the gift of Christ, in His care for the church, His body.<a name=37:36></a> There, there are evangelists: "He gave some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ" -- even the evangelists, for though they served in the world, they did not leave the fruits of their service there; they were brought into the church, never into a church, but into the church.<a name=37:37></a> And then pass on to verses 15, 16, "but speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ; from whom the whole body fitly joined together, and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body to the edifying of itself in love.<a name=37:38></a>" Can anything be clearer or more definite?<a name=37:39></a>

		Now it is the knowledge of this glorified Christ by the Holy Ghost which is the formative power of holiness.<a name=39:1></a> This I proceed to shew from Scripture.<a name=39:2></a> God chastises us (Hebrews 12: 10) that we may be partakers of His holiness.<a name=39:3></a> Hence, in a very remarkable passage in 1 Thessalonians 3: 12, 13, "and the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you: to the end he may establish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.<a name=39:4></a>" Where is the difference for faith between our responsible state here and our presentation before God our Father there?<a name=39:5></a> How far we realise it, is another and important question; but the measure and principle is the same, or rather, blessed be His name, all one.<a name=39:6></a> And this is wrought by the revelation of Christ to our souls by the Holy Ghost, and Christ as He is in glory.<a name=39:7></a> Hence He says: "For their sakes I sanctify myself [set myself apart as the glorified man in heaven] that they also might be sanctified through the truth.<a name=39:8></a>" And this is as clearly taught as possible.<a name=39:9></a> "Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.<a name=39:10></a> And he that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure," 1 John 3.<a name=39:11></a> Again, "We, beholding with open [unveiled, alluding to Moses' veil] face the glory of the Lord, are changed from glory to glory, into the same image, as by the Spirit of the Lord.<a name=39:12></a>" All this is as clear as possible.<a name=39:13></a> There are not two holinesses; we cannot say, any of us, that we have attained, but our conversation is in heaven; and as we have borne the image of the earthly, we shall bear the image of the heavenly.<a name=39:14></a> There is no other goal after which we run: our object is to grow up to Him who is the Head in all things, to the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.<a name=39:15></a> And note well here, this is not the question of our acceptance in Christ.<a name=39:16></a> There, there is no growth.<a name=39:17></a> As to that we say, "As he is so are we in this world.<a name=39:18></a>"

		It will be said, "But this is individual.<a name=40:1></a>" I admit it.<a name=40:2></a> I quote it to shew the principle on which God deals with us as regards our responsible state in this world.<a name=40:3></a> Being made partakers of the divine nature, having the risen and glorified Christ as our life, and the revelation of this glorified Christ by the Holy Ghost, we cannot look at anything as goal of attainment but that glorified Christ; and as He could say being a divine Person "the Son of man who is in heaven" -- making, and in Him perfectly, His life, what it was down here -- so we (united to Him in glory, sitting in heavenly places in Him, and the Holy Ghost revealing what eye has not seen nor ear heard nor entered into the heart of man to conceive) take the affections, spirit, self-denial, practical realisation of what answers to Him in glory, as the motive and measure of a holy walk here; and thus, he that saith he is <i>in Him</i> ought himself also so to walk even as He walked.<a name=40:4></a> Hence it is said "Be ye therefore imitators of God as dear children, and walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us and given himself for us, a sacrifice and offering to God for a sweet-smelling savour.<a name=40:5></a>" "Hereby know we love, that he laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.<a name=40:6></a>" And in this chapter of the Ephesians referred to, the other essential name of God is taken, Light, and we are declared to be light in the Lord, and are to walk as children of light; and if our poor eyes have drooped in sleep, and we are lying among the dead, we are called to awake from sleep and Christ shall give us light.<a name=40:7></a> Our life is hid with Christ in God; we have no other measure than what He is.<a name=40:8></a>

		The word of God is perfectly clear, and the identity of what is revealed and discerned by the Holy Ghost with what will be revealed in us, is seen to be of the very essence of Christianity, as Scripture presents it in its fulness.<a name=43:1></a> It is the very meaning of the phrase "we are saved in hope," and "though now we see Him not, we rejoice with joy unspeakable and glorified, receiving the end of our faith, the salvation of [our] souls.<a name=43:2></a>" A church of professors denies that it is the church of God.<a name=43:3></a> He does not form one of the professors, that is quite clear.<a name=43:4></a> The thought is next door to blasphemy.<a name=43:5></a> The system denies Christian responsibility, and that the professing church will be judged for its unfaithfulness.<a name=43:6></a> It falsifies the nature of holiness, and Christ's present relation to the church.<a name=43:7></a> There is no bride to say "Come!<a name=43:8></a>" No purity according to what there will be then, as in Thessalonians, or according to what Christ is now as in 1 John 3.<a name=43:9></a> No recognition of the predicted corruption of the church, for even now we have to walk with those who call on the name of the Lord out of a pure heart.<a name=43:10></a> If it were to be a church of professors, and God would have it so, how many are to be allowed?<a name=43:11></a> That such may creep in unawares nobody denies, but the theory is that this is what God owns, <i>His</i> church on earth; that we are not to purify ourselves from vessels to dishonour, or go outside the camp.<a name=43:12></a>

		My Dear Brother, <br>I fully recognise a deliverance, and have for fifty years, having then got it -- a deliverance which the evangelical world denies; and Pearsall Smith admitted in his last tract that all he meant by the "better life," was passing from Romans 7 into chapters 6 and 8; which is what I insisted on.<a name=48:1></a> My tract on cleansing with water goes into this.<a name=48:2></a> It is the passing from being under law, or the reference of acceptance to our state by redemption wrought in Christ, and experimentally known by the sealing of the Spirit, into the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free; indeed it is one special ministry in which I have been blessed, and on that deliverance I should insist.<a name=48:3></a>

		Further, it is a subject to be treated delicately, lest any should comfort themselves with the thought that you are content they should stay in the state spoken of in Romans 7, a supposition I should earnestly oppose.<a name=48:4></a> I do not think it is a Christian state at all: it is a man born again, but under the law, the state under the first husband.<a name=48:5></a> The deliverance is found in chapter 8, or more exactly the state of one delivered But my objection to the Wesleyan system, is, that it falsifies the whole Christian state as presented in Scripture; and, as to Dr.<a name=48:6></a> C.<a name=48:7></a>, there is scarcely one definition or position right or scriptural, and all so loose and incoherent, that it is difficult to deal with.<a name=48:8></a>

		The whole system naturally takes them out of grace: they must be absorbed by the idea of attainment, and the consecrating act is our own.<a name=56:4></a> That we should yield ourselves to God, as those alive to God, is blessedly scriptural, and have fruit unto holiness with the end -- not a state of holiness, but everlasting life; but it is the peaceful consciousness of a delivered soul who feels the claim of infinite love, and that it is not its own, but bought with a price.<a name=56:5></a> Here we are 'to do all we can,' even when dead in sins, whereas Scripture says, then we are quickened, created in Christ Jesus.<a name=56:6></a> We are, when dead, to 'surrender ourselves to be saved,' a thing never said in scripture; we are to submit to God's righteousness.<a name=56:7></a> And now mark the phrase, 'measurably quickened.<a name=56:8></a>' Are they born of God, or not?<a name=56:9></a> Have they life, eternal life?<a name=56:10></a> 'There is some life in them.<a name=56:11></a>' Those to whom Paul writes are viewed as having the old man crucified with Christ, and alive in Him; and what they are called to is, not to dream there is no sin in them, when there is, and call lusts no sin unless the will consents, but not to let sin reign in their mortal body, to fulfil it in its lusts.<a name=56:12></a> For sin should not have dominion over them, because they were not under law, but under grace, and, as alive and set free withal from the law of sin, given the blessed privilege, as being so, to yield themselves to God.<a name=56:13></a> It is a lovely passage, but exactly the contrary of what is stated in the tract.<a name=56:14></a> It is a freed man blessedly giving himself to God; not a man wanting to be free, able to do something, as having some life, to get free in another sense, altogether free from sin, a sense not in Scripture at all.<a name=56:15></a> It is Christ, not his own faith, nor repentance, nor prayer, that justifies the sinner; albeit the repentance, the faith, the prayer, are all necessary to the bestowment of the pardon.<a name=56:16></a> He puts this on wholly wrong ground, but I do not dwell on it.<a name=56:17></a>

		ON EVERLASTING PUNISHMENT -- "THE ETERNITY OF EVIL"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(Remarks on a paper of Reverend S.<a name=61:1></a> Minton)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Finding that great misconception prevails with regard to the views propounded in a course of sermons lately preached at Eaton Chapel, I think it well to give the following summary of them.<a name=61:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"1.<a name=61:3></a> Scripture declares that the 'everlasting punishment' of the wicked will consist of 'everlasting destruction,' after the infliction of 'many' or 'few stripes,' according to their several deserts.<a name=61:4></a> The popular theory teaches that it will consist of everlasting pain.<a name=61:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"2.<a name=61:6></a> Scripture declares that God will 'destroy both body and soul in hell.<a name=61:7></a>' The popular theory teaches that He will destroy neither one nor the other; but preserve both of them alive for ever, in unmitigated agony.<a name=61:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"3.<a name=61:9></a> Scripture declares that 'our God is a consuming fire.<a name=61:10></a>' The popular theory teaches that He is only a scorching fire.<a name=61:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"4.<a name=61:12></a> Scripture declares that the 'fiery indignation' will 'devour the adversaries.<a name=61:13></a>' The popular theory teaches that it will do no such thing, but only torture them.<a name=61:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"5.<a name=61:15></a> Scripture declares that the wicked will perish 'like natural brute beasts.<a name=61:16></a>' The popular theory teaches that there will be no analogy whatever between the two cases.<a name=61:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"6.<a name=61:18></a> Scripture declares that whosoever 'will save his life' by unfaithfulness to Christ, shall ultimately 'lose it' in a far more terrible manner.<a name=61:19></a> The popular theory teaches that no man can lose his life more than once, and that 'the second death' is no death at all, but eternal life in sin and misery.<a name=61:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"7.<a name=61:21></a> Scripture declares that whosoever 'doeth the will of God abideth for ever.<a name=61:22></a>' The popular theory teaches that every man will abide for ever, whether he does the will of God or not.<a name=61:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"8.<a name=61:24></a> Scripture declares that if we desire 'immortality,' we must seek it 'by patient continuance in well doing.<a name=61:25></a>' The popular theory teaches that every man possesses inherent indefeasible immortality, and what we have to seek for, is, that it may prove a blessing, and not a curse, to us.<a name=61:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"9.<a name=61:27></a> Scripture declares that 'the wages of sin is death.<a name=61:28></a>' The popular theory teaches that it is eternal life in misery; in other words, that God will inflict upon impenitent sinners a punishment <i>infinitely greater</i> than what He has pronounced to be their due.<a name=61:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"10.<a name=61:30></a> Scripture declares that 'the gift of God is eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=61:31></a>' The popular theory teaches that eternal life is the common possession of all men, and that the gift of God, through Christ, is the privilege of spending it in holiness and happiness.<a name=61:32></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"11.<a name=61:33></a> Scripture declares that 'the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil.<a name=61:34></a>' The popular theory teaches that they never will be destroyed at all, but that a portion of the universe will be specially set apart for the eternal exhibition of them in their fullest maturity.<a name=61:35></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"12.<a name=61:36></a> Scripture declares that Christ <i>is</i> to 'reconcile all things to God.<a name=61:37></a>' The popular theory teaches that all things <i>will never</i> be reconciled to God; that discord and disorder will never <i>cease</i>, but only be confined to one particular locality.<a name=61:38></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"13.<a name=61:39></a> Scripture declares that in Christ 'all things consist.<a name=61:40></a>' The popular theory teaches that a whole kingdom will 'consist' for ever, although <i>not 'in</i> Him.<a name=61:41></a>'
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"14.<a name=61:42></a> Scripture declares that 'he that hath the Son, hath life; but he that hath not the Son of God, hath not life'; that 'if we live after the flesh, we shall die, but if, through the Spirit, we mortify the deeds of the body, we shall live.<a name=61:43></a>' The advocates of the popular theory, say, that the life of the believers and unbelievers, of natural men and spiritual men, must be of equal duration -- that the doctrine of eternal happiness, and the doctrine of eternal misery, must stand or fall together -- in other words, that if what scripture asserts be true, what it denies must be also true.<a name=61:44></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"I take my stand, therefore, on the plain, consistent, emphatic teaching of the whole bible, from beginning to end, as opposed to the 'traditions of men,' which have so grievously perverted it, and thereby obscured the glory of Christ, reduced to an unmeaning form the declaration that 'God is love,' produced a frightful amount of infidelity, robbed the law of its terrors, by making it threaten sinners with what they are sure will never be executed, incalculably weakened the saving power of the gospel, and damaged the believer's whole spiritual constitution, by putting an unnatural strain upon it, that God never intended it to bear.<a name=61:45></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"The three or four passages that are thought to confirm the traditional view have been examined in a volume entitled, 'The Glory of Christ in the Creation and Reconciliation of all Things' (Longmans), and been found either to entirely fail in lending it even the appearance of support, or to be but as dust in the balance against the overpowering weight of testimony on the other side.<a name=61:46></a>

		1. As to the first statement of the accompanying paper, it is false.<a name=63:1></a> Scripture does not speak of everlasting destruction after the infliction of many or few stripes.<a name=63:2></a> It is simply false; it speaks of everlasting destruction from His presence, when Christ comes, and it speaks of many or few stripes <i>at the same</i> time in Luke <i>not</i> after; proving quite the contrary -- that destruction does not mean ceasing to exist.<a name=63:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2. Destruction does not mean causing to cease to exist.<a name=63:4></a> "The <i>lost</i> sheep of the house of Israel" is the same word.<a name=63:5></a> "O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself.<a name=63:6></a>" "Carest thou not that we perish?<a name=63:7></a>" Destruction cannot be everlasting, if it means causing to cease to exist.<a name=63:8></a> Indeed, it is not said (which I merely note to shew the carelessness of the writer) that "God will destroy both body and soul in hell," but that He is able.<a name=63:9></a> Man can only kill the body.<a name=63:10></a> It is a question of power to be feared.<a name=63:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3. As to the third, it is clap-trap; and when Scripture is consulted, it proves the contrary.<a name=63:12></a> In Deuteronomy 4: 24, God is a jealous God, a consuming fire, and Israel are destroyed (that is, perish off the land, and are scattered).<a name=63:13></a> They are destroyed, and perish, but do not cease to exist.<a name=63:14></a>

		4. This, again, proves the idle inattention to Scripture on this weighty subject.<a name=64:1></a> If devouring adversaries means ceasing to exist, it is the end of sore punishment, and is the <i>same</i> result as for those who died without mercy.<a name=64:2></a> Yet it is "much sorer punishment"; that is, the whole principle of interpretation is careless and false.<a name=64:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5. As to this, the scripture never says anything of the kind.<a name=64:4></a> The people are compared to beasts, not the destruction.<a name=64:5></a> The word, too, itself is used here for moral corruption, shewing it does not mean mere ceasing to exist.<a name=64:6></a> Compare 1 Corinthians 3: 17 in Greek.<a name=64:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6. As to this, Scripture says nothing of the kind.<a name=64:8></a> This is too bad, because Scripture speaks expressly of the second death, which is the lake of fire; that is, as far as language goes, that he does lose his life more than once.<a name=64:9></a> A second death is declared to <i>be</i> the torment of the lake of fire, not its termination; at any rate, a second death is a statement of losing life more than once.<a name=64:10></a> I notice it to shew the extreme carelessness of assertion; for I do not believe that, in the full sense of ceasing to exist, life ceases in either case.<a name=64:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7. In saying he that does the will of God abides for ever, it is wholly in contrast with the fashion of this world, and there is no allusion to the wicked, good or bad; nothing is said about them.<a name=64:12></a> Elsewhere it is taught that they survive death, and are punished eternally.<a name=64:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		8. It is false; it speaks of incorruptibility, which Scripture distinguishes from immortality; and in the passage, a state of glory is referred to, not the mortality, nor immortality, of the soul, neither of which is spoken of.<a name=64:14></a>
	</div>

		10.<a name=64:17></a> Eternal life and immortality are distinct things.<a name=64:18></a> Christ is eternal life (see 1 John 1), and God gives it us in giving Christ; nor is it ever said even to be in us, but in His Son; and so we have it.<a name=64:19></a> Eternal life is in the Son; and he that has the Son, has life.<a name=64:20></a> This the wicked have not.<a name=64:21></a> The angels are immortal, but they are never said to have eternal life.<a name=64:22></a> There is no such thought as that eternal life is the common possession of all men; there is, that men have immortal, undying souls -- a very different thing.<a name=64:23></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I have a word to add.<a name=65:20></a> The doctrine presented does not say all.<a name=65:21></a> I have not, according to it, an immortal soul, now or at all, but a mere animal life, such as a beast has, though superior in degree of intelligence.<a name=65:22></a> God, it may be alleged, could give eternal life to a beast.<a name=65:23></a> Be it so; but the beast cannot be responsible for sin while he is a beast, nor repent of what he had done; nor can I; nor can any atonement be made for it.<a name=65:24></a> Thus, with a pretended doctrine of eternal life and love and mercy, responsibility, repentance, and atonement disappear.<a name=65:25></a> This is wholly of Satan.<a name=65:26></a> Scripture everywhere teaches these truths; and I cite, as first distinctly establishing it, the case of Cain; Genesis 4: 6, 7.<a name=65:27></a> The creation of man brings out as distinctly as possible, the difference of man's position as to his soul; Genesis 1: 24.<a name=65:28></a> "And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind.<a name=65:29></a>" And man is not included.<a name=65:30></a> "God saw that it was good.<a name=65:31></a>" It was the subject creation; man's is taken up apart in verse 26, when man is created in God's image, and after His likeness.<a name=65:32></a> And the manner is taught in chapter 2: 7.<a name=65:33></a> He formed man out of the dust, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life.<a name=65:34></a> That is, it was by a direct communication from God Himself that he became a living soul.<a name=65:35></a>

		LETTER ON IMMORTALITY AND EVERLASTING PUNISHMENT
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My Dear Brother, <br>As this question, this evil heresy, is the one by which, most commonly just now, Satan seeks to perplex the minds of the simple, I write a line to you in connection with the tract sent to me.<a name=67:1></a> A great many human names are introduced, but Scripture is little inquired into.<a name=67:2></a> In this doctrine the great point of consequence to me is that the true character and import of sin, of atonement, of repentance, are overlooked, and the responsibility of man.<a name=67:3></a> Atonement is either denied or dropped out.<a name=67:4></a> Here it is entirely dropped out.<a name=67:5></a> Now it is evident, if temporary punishment is the whole desert of sin, Christ had only to suffer accordingly.<a name=67:6></a> Repentance is proportionate.<a name=67:7></a> And one of the chief teachers in the United States declared in his book, that the deep distress of conscience and terror about sin committed was a base servile fear and wrong.<a name=67:8></a> To one who found he had lost the atonement and the sense of responsibility out of his mind, and who asked him what he made of responsibility, he replied, it was impossible to reconcile it with his system, but he saw it in Scripture, and so did not deny it.<a name=67:9></a> They insist that souls of men and beasts are the same, and plead Genesis to this end -- all in whom was the breath of life perished in the flood -- that beasts have a living soul and so has man.<a name=67:10></a> If this be so (that we have more intelligence, but a living soul like a beast's), you cannot charge a beast with sin, nor make Christ die to put away a beast's sins.<a name=67:11></a> What did Christ do for us -- not as giving life, but in the way of atonement?<a name=67:12></a> That is the grave question.<a name=67:13></a> Again, they confound eternal life and immortality, which is not honest.<a name=67:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Save as to the immortality of God, where it declares death, of course, has no part, mortality and immortality as to men, are applied solely to the body and have nothing to do with eternal life.<a name=67:15></a> Eternal life is what we have in the Second Adam: the question is the condition of the first.<a name=67:16></a> Thus, "when this mortal shall have put on immortality," "the life of Jesus in our mortal flesh.<a name=67:17></a>" The places are these -- Romans 6: 12, "mortal body"; chapter 8: 11, "mortal bodies"; 1 Corinthians 15: 53, "this mortal"; verse 54, where it is the resurrection, that is, the body (or change); 2 Corinthians 4: 11, "our mortal flesh"; verse 4, "mortality swallowed up of life," when he speaks of the tabernacle we are groaning in.<a name=67:18></a> Mortality is always of the body; immortality is put in contrast with mortality (not mortality of the soul, but of your present mortal condition).<a name=67:19></a> 1 Corinthians 15: 53, 54, is the change from a mortal state.<a name=67:20></a> Otherwise it is used only of God.<a name=67:21></a> In 1 Timothy 6: 16, He is undying in nature.<a name=67:22></a> Mortal is applied to our present state, but is not applied to the soul at all.<a name=67:23></a> That God only has immortality does not affect an undying existence conferred; for angels are not mortal, as all admit, and as Luke 20: 36 shews.<a name=67:24></a> With these and the state of the fallen angels these teachers never trouble themselves.<a name=67:25></a> Men must not suffer; their love goes no farther than themselves.<a name=67:26></a> Now the everlasting punishment is prepared for the devil and his angels, and there the judged of Matthew 25 are sent; so Revelation 20: 10, 15; chapter 21: 8.<a name=67:27></a>

		As to the life we have naturally, beasts were formed by God's word out of the ground, and there the ordinary creation ended, and then beasts were pronounced good; Genesis 1: 25.<a name=68:1></a> And then God proceeds in solemn consultation to form man as His image, as lord of all that had been created, and in His likeness, and first makes him a frame out of the dust, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man by partaking of what came directly from God became a living soul (not at all as the beasts), God's image on the earth.<a name=68:2></a> Hence he is called (Acts 17) His offspring.<a name=68:3></a> He has a spirit as well as a mere soul, when the distinction needs to be made, which death does not touch.<a name=68:4></a> We are not to fear them which kill the body and after that have no more that they can do -- that death does not touch what is beside bodily life.<a name=68:5></a> I will speak of "destroy" in good time; but death leaves the soul in existence, not merely the souls of saints.<a name=68:6></a> When the resurrection was called into question by the Sadducees, it is not said of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob only, that they are alive, nor is this founded on their being saints, though they were such, but it is added, "for all live unto him.<a name=68:7></a>" Death does not affect the soul, All live, not for man indeed on the earth but, for God.<a name=68:8></a>

		Then as to this word "everlasting.<a name=69:1></a>" It is incontrovertible that its proper sense is everlasting.<a name=69:2></a> It is defined carefully to mean it by Aristotle and Philo (the last a religious Jewish writer of the apostles' age) and others.<a name=69:3></a> Scripture speaks of the eternal God, the eternal Spirit, the eternal inheritance, eternal redemption; and what makes it conclusively evident that the word in itself means it is the statement of the apostle in 2 Corinthians 4: "The things which are seen are temporal, and the things which are not seen are eternal," where it is used in express contrast with temporal, without any subject (as they allege) which on other grounds shews what it means.<a name=69:4></a> So eternal life and eternal punishment are used in direct contrast -- eternal life is in Christ, the gift of God.<a name=69:5></a> It is only named twice in the Old Testament, and both refer to the millennium (Daniel 12; Psalm 133); for life and incorruptibility were brought to light by the gospel.<a name=69:6></a> In Romans 2: 7 it is incorruptibility, not immortality.<a name=69:7></a>

		Another thing important to remark here is the abuse of the word "die.<a name=70:1></a>" We may be quite right in seeing, as spiritual persons, that men may be dead while they live; and that we may be dead in sin, as towards God, when alive; and that the <i>judgment</i> of death implies estrangement from God, as the gift of life is bringing us, in principle, in blessedness to Him.<a name=70:2></a> But dying in its positive sense is never applied to the soul.<a name=70:3></a> Thus Ezekiel 18, constantly quoted for this, and used by good people with good intentions, speaks only of death in this world -- present judgment here; not for a father's, but for our own sins.<a name=70:4></a>

		Quoting such a passage as "He that hath not the Son of God hath not life" proves utter confusion of mind; for if I were a living sinner, I have not life in that sense, yet am alive all the same; and if I never died at all, was not mortal as to the body, I should not have it a bit more.<a name=70:5></a> What lost life has the sinner no power to regain?<a name=70:6></a> Not the fact of life (namely, conscious existence); he has it as much as ever.<a name=70:7></a> It does not touch the question; and I know from Christ's word that death to which I am sentenced does not affect the soul.<a name=70:8></a> Why so diligently confound spiritual life and actual existence?<a name=70:9></a> And this is the whole secret of the way they puzzle people -- poor work!<a name=70:10></a> Death as judgment on man may intimate a great deal more, just as life does.<a name=70:11></a> But "thou shalt surely die" was bringing in mortality; and hence man was not allowed to touch the tree of life lest he should eat and live for ever -- live for ever as a sinner in the world.<a name=70:12></a> Here, as a matter of fact, God was not precluding him from getting spiritual life; and if when actually alive, as he was, he had eaten of the other tree, he would not have died at all.<a name=70:13></a> Immortality in his then state, before or after the fall, would have been immortality as a living man as he then was.<a name=70:14></a> The death threatened we have plainly declared to us -- "till thou return unto the ground, for out of it wast thou taken; for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.<a name=70:15></a>"Did the spirit God breathed into Adam come out of the dust?<a name=70:16></a> It returns to God who gave it; and the body will be raised, and then judgment come, and only then the award of sin by judgment.<a name=70:17></a> The corruption of the body is only an intermediate state.<a name=70:18></a> common alike to saints and sinners, just as death itself is, save by special intervention of God's power.<a name=70:19></a>

		The statement of everlasting punishment to a simple soul is as plain as possible in Scripture: "These shall go away into everlasting punishment, and the righteous into everlasting life.<a name=71:5></a>" To a simple soul it would be monstrous to say that "everlasting" was not meant to mean the same thing.<a name=71:6></a> They are "tormented for ever and ever.<a name=71:7></a>" Death gives up all it held, into the lake of fire -- that is, for ever and ever; the same word always used in that book for God's existence.<a name=71:8></a> "They are punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord.<a name=71:9></a>" Now everlasting destruction has no sense if non-existence be meant by destruction.<a name=71:10></a> Total destruction I understand; but everlasting destruction in such a sense, is nonsense.<a name=71:11></a> And in this case, on their own theory, it is no destruction then at all; for 2 Thessalonians 1 is at the beginning of the millennium, when, according to their own system, and my own full conviction, they are not destroyed at all.<a name=71:12></a>

		This leads me to the word "destroy.<a name=71:13></a>" It is, like death, used for the ruin of a present state of things, even moral ruin, not for cessation of existence.<a name=71:14></a> "O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself; but in me is thy help.<a name=71:15></a>" "I am not sent but to the <i>lost</i> sheep of the house of Israel" -- the same word.<a name=71:16></a> "He that loseth [destroyeth] his life for my sake, shall save it.<a name=71:17></a>" "Carest thou not that we perish?<a name=71:18></a>" Zacharias "perished between the temple and the altar.<a name=71:19></a>" Take an English-Greek Concordance, and you will easily see.<a name=71:20></a> So destruction; waste of the ointment; the son of perdition; damnable heresies -- heresies which ruin people.<a name=71:21></a> Moral ruin is meant, as well as destruction of existence, if that is ever meant.<a name=71:22></a> The world of the flood perished -- the flood came and destroyed them all; Yet they are spirits in prison after that another proof that death destroys no soul; does not mean it.<a name=71:23></a> Abaddon and Appolyon are the Hebrew and Greek for destroyer: are they able to make to cease to exist finally?<a name=71:24></a> Take "abad" (Englishman's Hebrew Concordance page 8); I do not think "destroy" is ever used for finally ceasing to exist, but totally ruining as to the state anything has been in.<a name=71:25></a> When men are everlastingly destroyed from the presence of the Lord, it confessedly is not so; they then go into punishment; but that is final.<a name=71:26></a> And when it is said, "their fire is not quenched," to assert that it means that they do not exist at all is a miserable come-off, not more.<a name=71:27></a> It is a figure no one denies, and refers, as is stated, to Isaiah; but the figure is one of the continuous existence of the objects of punishment.<a name=71:28></a> "From one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another.<a name=71:29></a> shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the Lord; and they shall go forth and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me, for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched, and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.<a name=71:30></a>" It is continuing abiding objects of punishment which are now before the eyes of those who come up.<a name=71:31></a> It was not a supply of fresh material, etc.<a name=71:32></a> All this is false.<a name=71:33></a> The opposite is what God is teaching.<a name=71:34></a> It is of continued existence; it is the carcases that were indestructible -- at any rate undestroyed: an external matter, no doubt, in Isaiah, and used by the Lord as a figure, but a figure of continued shame and misery, and no fresh supply.<a name=71:35></a> And what is the meaning of everlastingly supplying hell, where body and soul are, with fresh materials?<a name=71:36></a> "Destroyed for ever," Psalm 92: 7, applied to this world; so Psalm 104: 35, "consumed out of the earth.<a name=71:37></a>" You may take it as a general rule, that in the Old Testament, judgment, destruction, etc.<a name=71:38></a>, refer to this world, though a future state is referred to in the Psalms.<a name=71:39></a>

		If you deal with a simple soul, shew it the plain language of Scripture: "These shall go away into everlasting punishment.<a name=74:1></a>" Conscience will tell what that means, and if they have been dealt with to prove eternal does not mean eternal, shew them what is said in 2 Corinthians 4: 18; and simple souls, souls where Satan's wiles have not polluted them, will bow to the plain word of God.<a name=74:2></a> I have nothing to do with popular statements (though better, if essentially sound, than these immoral deceits); but the conscious subsistence of the soul after death, and eternal judgment and punishment of the wicked, are as plainly taught in Scripture as possible.<a name=74:3></a> Men have spoken of it (though sound in intentions) in a way designing people can lay hold of, specially from the Lord's coming not having been seen.<a name=74:4></a> But the word of God is clear.<a name=74:5></a> It does not detail the misery as it does the blessing, and this is its perfection; but it declares it, and this is right.<a name=74:6></a> "I am" is <i>essential</i> existence.<a name=74:7></a> No other word is used for the duration of God's existence which is not used for that of the punishment and torment of the wicked.<a name=74:8></a> And while a few persons have been scandalised who seek their own thoughts and take their own feelings, when there is no just sense of what their sins have deserved (for this is the secret of it), how many thousands of thousands have been awakened by the just terror of judgment!<a name=74:9></a>

		THE DEITY OF CHRIST AND WHAT CONSTITUTES CHRISTIANITY; BEING AN ANSWER TO THE INQUIRIES OF AN UNITARIAN STUDENT OF DIVINITY
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first place, there are the direct passages -- John 1: 1: "The Word was with God, and was God.<a name=75:1></a>" This is in every way a striking passage: when <i>every</i> thing began, He was -- that is, had no beginning, was God, as indeed it must be, yet was a distinct personality; He was with God, and always such, was so in the beginning, that He created everything.<a name=75:2></a> Subsequently we find the Word made flesh.<a name=75:3></a> The effort to weaken the force of the word of God here by the absence of the article is perfectly futile; unless in reciprocal propositions the predicate never has the article.<a name=75:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We find in Hebrews 1 the same truths.<a name=75:5></a> He the Messiah, for of Him he speaks, the Son, is God, is worshipped by angels, in the beginning laid the foundations of the earth, and is "the same" -- in Hebrew (Psalm 102), atta Hu, Thou art the existing One, the Being, where the testimony is so much the stronger by comparison with verse 12 of the Psalm, where Christ in humiliation addresses Jehovah.<a name=75:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In John 8 we find, "before Abraham was I AM," in contrast with His age as man; which the Jews perfectly understood, and would have killed Him for blasphemy.<a name=75:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Colossians 1: 16: "All things were created by him and for him," where it is unquestionable Christ is spoken of, the true force of verse 19 being "all the fulness <i>(pleeroma)</i> was pleased to dwell in Him," and spoken of Him as man living upon earth, and accomplished in fact in chapter 2: 9, "in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.<a name=75:8></a>"

		So John the Baptist's ministry was preparing the way of Jehovah, Matthew 3: 3, quoting Isaiah 40: Malachi 3: 1, "I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me, and Jehovah, whom ye seek, shall come.<a name=76:1></a>" (Compare Mark 1: 41.<a name=76:2></a>) If the judgment to come on the earth is referred to, difference of interpretation as to this, or the passing on from Christ's first coming to His second, does not affect the question of the Person who comes; He who first came will come again.<a name=76:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The more we compare passages as to this, the more we shall see this identification, and that it is not forcing one or two texts, but the doctrine of Scripture woven into its whole texture.<a name=76:4></a> Jehovah is Israel's righteousness, but Christ is made our righteousness.<a name=76:5></a> "The Lord (Jehovah) my God shall come, and all his saints with thee" (Zechariah 14: 5) .<a name=76:6></a> "and Jehovah said .<a name=76:7></a>.<a name=76:8></a>.<a name=76:9></a> a goodly price that I was prized at of them, and I took the thirty pieces of silver," etc.<a name=76:10></a> "Then shall Jehovah go forth .<a name=76:11></a>.<a name=76:12></a>.<a name=76:13></a> and his feet shall stand in that day on the Mount of Olives," chapters 11, 14.<a name=76:14></a> So, as to Redeemer, Jehovah alone is their Redeemer.<a name=76:15></a> In Isaiah 63 this Redeemer is clearly Christ.<a name=76:16></a> So in Isaiah 50: "Thus saith Jehovah .<a name=76:17></a>.<a name=76:18></a>.<a name=76:19></a> .<a name=76:20></a> Wherefore when I came was there no man?<a name=76:21></a>" And then He goes on, and asserts His unenfeebled divine power, yet He continues, "Jehovah-elohim hath given me the tongue of the learned," and the sufferings of Christ are then spoken of.<a name=76:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Psalm 2 the kings of the earth are called to trust in the Son -- the Christ -- yet a curse is pronounced on trusting in man, or in any one but Jehovah.<a name=76:23></a> See Revelation 22, He who comes quickly is Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, the first and the last.<a name=76:24></a> (I do not quote chapter 1: 11, as it is probably not genuine, nor verse 8, because its application to Christ may be questioned, although I have no doubt of it.<a name=76:25></a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In many of the passages in which God and the Lord Jesus are mentioned, with one article in Greek, it may possibly unite them, only in the subject matter of the sentence.<a name=76:26></a> Hence, although I think they prove a great deal as to the identification of God and the Lord Jesus, I do not quote them as simply proving, in an absolute way, the divinity of Christ.<a name=76:27></a> But the force of the passage in Titus is apparent, "Waiting for the appearing of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ.<a name=76:28></a>" It is unquestionably Christ who appears; as it is now in the face of Jesus Christ that we see the glory of the Lord.<a name=76:29></a>

		This unity of God and Christ is manifest throughout John's writings, "I and my Father are one.<a name=77:1></a>" "We are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ.<a name=77:2></a> This is the true God and eternal life.<a name=77:3></a>" Take, again, such an example -- for it is only an example -- "And now, little children, abide in him, that when he shall appear we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.<a name=77:4></a> If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is <i>born of Him</i>.<a name=77:5></a> Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God; therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.<a name=77:6></a> Beloved, now are we the sons of God; and it does not yet appear what we shall be, but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.<a name=77:7></a>" Now, who will say to whom this applies Christ, or God?<a name=77:8></a> It is impossible to distinguish them.<a name=77:9></a> What characterises all the writings of John, in the language of Christ, is One who has the place and title of perfect equality, yet now being a Man, takes nothing, never glorifies Himself, but receives all from His Father, as in John 17.<a name=77:10></a> In them we have God over all, blessed for ever (Romans 9: 5), which, I doubt not, for my part, is the only true sense; and other passages I do not quote, as they are matters of criticism.<a name=77:11></a> Indeed, I have only cited such as suggest themselves to my memory.<a name=77:12></a> So Thomas -- "My Lord and my God.<a name=77:13></a>"

		But there is another class of tests, which to the mind, sensible of what is due to God, evidently shew who He is.<a name=77:14></a> Grace coming from Him, as is found everywhere -- "Out of his fulness have we all received, and grace for grace.<a name=77:15></a>" Christ is all.<a name=77:16></a> His love passes knowledge.<a name=77:17></a> Christ is to dwell in my heart by faith.<a name=77:18></a> If Christ be to me what the scripture says He is to be to me, and be not God, <i>He</i> must exclude God altogether.<a name=77:19></a> The very fact that Christ made Himself of no reputation when in the form of God, is again a moral proof of His divine nature.<a name=77:20></a> Every creature was bound to keep its first estate; He who was high and sovereign could, in grace, come down and take another nature.<a name=77:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Everything confirms this.<a name=77:22></a> He does not merely work miracles and cast out devils, but sends others out, and gives them authority over all devils.<a name=77:23></a> When He says, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up," who was dwelling in the temple?<a name=77:24></a> This kind of proof shines forth in every page of the gospels, and to the mind whose eye is open to see, affords a proof more powerful even than individual texts stating it in the letter, as I speak of the letter.<a name=77:25></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Let me add the remark, that when it is said the fulness of the Godhead dwells in Him bodily, it is not a vague word, as we speak of what is divine.<a name=78:1></a> The Greek has a distinct word for these two things; for the vague thought it is <i>theiotees</i>, used in Romans 1; and <i>theotees</i>, used in Colossians 2.<a name=78:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Where the leper says, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst, and He says, I will, be thou clean -- who can so speak?<a name=78:3></a> The proofs that He is a man must not be cited against it.<a name=78:4></a> We hold to this as anxiously as any one.<a name=78:5></a> His being God is only of special value to us because He is man -- a true very man, though a sinless one -- God with us, and then we in Him before God -- One who took flesh and blood, that He might die, and partook of flesh and blood because the children were partakers of it -- a dependent, obedient man, who, though He had life in Himself, lived by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God.<a name=78:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When I am called to believe in Jesus Christ come in flesh, which Christians are, they hold He is a man; but why insist on this?<a name=78:7></a> If He was simply a man, how else could man come?<a name=78:8></a> Not an angel, for an angel must not leave its estate, and He did not take up angels -- words which have no sense if He had been one, and was taking up the cause of others as such.<a name=78:9></a> When He says, "the only-begotten Son, who <i>is</i> in the bosom of the Father," and that He is in the Father, and the Father in Him, the last might be said of a man, perhaps; the former impossible as a mere man, or of any but a divine Person.<a name=78:10></a> So, when He says, "None hath ascended up to heaven," that is, to state what is there -- "save he that came down from heaven, the Son of man, who is in heaven.<a name=78:11></a>" And, if all men are to honour the Son even as they honour the Father, it cannot be that He is a mere man, or not have the nature which is to be honoured.<a name=78:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Jehovah has sworn that <i>every</i> knee shall bow to Him, and every tongue give an account of himself to God, but it is at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow.<a name=78:13></a> Hence, though the Son quickens whom He will, as the Father, yet the Father judges no man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son, that all may honour the Son as they honour Him.<a name=78:14></a> There is no God but Jehovah -- I know not any, as says the prophet; but we have seen, by multiplied examples that Christ is Jehovah.<a name=78:15></a>

		That as Son He has taken a place subject to the Father as man, every Christian believes -- receives the glory He once had with the Father before the world was -- every one who bows to Scripture joyfully accepts; for He is a man for ever, in that sense a servant, but He who is the servant can say, I and my Father are one, and I am in the Father, and he who has seen Him has seen the Father also.<a name=79:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Compare the description of the Ancient of Days in Daniel 7 and Revelation 1, and see if the Ancient of Days, who receives the Son of man in Daniel 7, be not the Son of man in Revelation 1, and in Daniel 7 too; from verse 22 of the chapter the Ancient of Days comes.<a name=79:2></a> Hence we have, "the blessed and only Potentate, King of kings, and Lord of lords" -- then, the appearing of Christ; but in Revelation He who comes on the white horse has on His vesture and on His thigh, King of kings, and Lord of lords.<a name=79:3></a> You see, the more Scripture is gone through, the more comes to light that He is the true God and Eternal Life.<a name=79:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I know not that I need multiply passages, after these I have quoted.<a name=79:5></a> What you will remark, is, that it is not a question of expressions as to which criticism may be exercised, but the doctrine and system of Scripture.<a name=79:6></a> It is Christianity, as it is given to us in Scripture.<a name=79:7></a> I take up Christianity as the truth, and that is Christianity.<a name=79:8></a> A religion is what it professes itself to be, and that is what Christianity professes itself to be -- the revelation of God, and eternal life in the Person of Christ.<a name=79:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It professes another truth, that is, atonement, or expiation of sin.<a name=79:10></a> It does not teach a goodness of God which can bear with any sin, but maintains the perfect holiness of God, and the putting away of sin, but it does it in a way which equally maintains infinite and perfect love.<a name=79:11></a> Man instinctively felt the need of expiation.<a name=79:12></a> This is publicly known in heathenism; but there it was very much the dread of a god who had passions like ourselves, and men might justly say, <i>tantaene animis coelestibus irae</i> (can such anger dwell in heavenly minds)?<a name=79:13></a> Judaism, as revealed of God, maintained this thought, but it began by a deliverance of the people, and witnessed a God not revealed, but who gave commandments, ordained sacrifices, which kept up the thought that sin would in nowise be allowed; but it was the "forbearance of God" in view of a work to be accomplished, the way into the holiest not yet having been made manifest, nor peace given to man's conscience, though it was relieved through sacrifice when occasion called for it; Christ appears in the end of the world to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself; was once offered to bear the sins of many, and give a perfect conscience, without diminishing -- nay, in maintaining in the highest way -- holiness, in the judgment of sin in the conscience, according to the majesty of God; and withal giving the perfect sense of unbounded love, in that God did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us -- the love that gave Christ.<a name=79:14></a> Christ gave Himself in a love that is divine, and passes knowledge.<a name=79:15></a>

		When I turn to the New Testament, I find Christ stating that He came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give His life a ransom for many (Matthew 20: 28).<a name=81:1></a> The Lord's supper -- the standing institution of Christianity -- is the sign of His blood shed for many, for the remission of sins.<a name=81:2></a> John the Baptist points Him out as the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world; John 1: 29.<a name=81:3></a> Paul tells us that God hath set Him forth as a propitiation, through faith in His blood (Romans 3: 25); <i>Peter</i>, that we are redeemed by the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot (1 Peter 1: 18, 19); Jo<i>hn</i>, that He is the propitiation for our sins and the whole world (1 John 2: 2); <i>Peter</i>, again, that He bare our sins in His own body on the tree; 1 Peter 2: 24.<a name=81:4></a> The <i>Hebrews</i> enlarges on it fully as a doctrine.<a name=81:5></a> He must offer for sins (chapter 9).<a name=81:6></a> He offers one sacrifice for sins, and then sits down (chapter 10).<a name=81:7></a> We have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins; Ephesians 1: 7.<a name=81:8></a> We are justified by His blood; Romans 5: 9.<a name=81:9></a> Without shedding of blood is no remission; Hebrews 9: 22.<a name=81:10></a> He gave Himself for our sins; Galatians 1: 4.<a name=81:11></a> It is when He had made the purification of our sins that He sat down on the right hand of the Majesty in the heavens; Hebrews 1: 3.<a name=81:12></a> Cleansing, justification, forgiveness, peace, redemption, are all attributed to His blood.<a name=81:13></a> He bare our sins, gave Himself for our sins, makes propitiation for the world, is delivered for our offences.<a name=81:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As I have said, it is a doctrine interwoven with all Scripture, forms one of the bases of Christianity, is the sole ground of remission -- and there is none without shedding blood -- and that by which Christ has made peace; Colossians 1: 20.<a name=81:15></a> The thought that He was sealing merely His doctrines by His death is utterly groundless, it is never stated as its force in Scripture, expiation is constantly; and if it was a mere testimony -- perfect as He was in it -- it does not serve for one, for the testimony would be, that the most faithful of men was forsaken of God.<a name=81:16></a> What testimony would that be?<a name=81:17></a> Take out expiation, and Scripture becomes impossible to understand: introduce it, and all is plain.<a name=81:18></a>

		LETTERS ON THE REVISED NEW TESTAMENT
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My Dear -- , <br>I have no pretension, with the leisure or ability I have, to give even a summary view of the Revision of the New Testament, which now occupies every one.<a name=85:1></a> But it seems to me, that, while there are many excellent changes in it, it is, for any practical purpose, a failure.<a name=85:2></a> It might seem invidious in one who has published a new translation to comment on this; perhaps presumptuous for an individual, when so many learned men have been engaged in it.<a name=85:3></a> But I might quote a crowd of passages in which they have adopted as their version what I had also adopted from the Greek, and that in some very important passages, besides a crowd of less important ones.<a name=85:4></a> I do not set about to criticise their text, though I should strongly demur to some changes; nor do I pretend to have gone through the whole in detail.<a name=85:5></a> But where the word of God is in question, our minds should rise above all considerations but one: Is the mind of God, as given in His word, substantially afforded us in what we possess in the Revision?<a name=85:6></a> Two objects may be sought in it, to this end: it may be before us as a public Bible for the country, taking the place of the Authorised Version; or as a book of reference for the student of the word, to have a more sure and certain sound for his own soul.<a name=85:7></a> It does not seem to me it can be either.<a name=85:8></a> If, indeed, it had, so to speak, a divine stamp upon it as a translation, this might have overcome the nature influences of a long and, in very many excellent qualities, justly cherished translation.<a name=85:9></a> But I do not think this is so.<a name=85:10></a> We have many appliances in the version -- learning, scholarship, textual criticism, and, I do not a moment doubt, assiduous care.<a name=85:11></a> But I do not see the mind of Christ, the spiritual-mindedness which alone can reproduce the word of God; nor do I think there is a fine sense of many Greek usages of words, nor of the finer shades of English ones.<a name=85:12></a> The definite article is put in, with no notice that it is not in the Greek, where it makes a very great difference.<a name=85:13></a> Thus <i>Kurios</i> (Lord), without the article for Jehovah following the LXX, and <i>the Lord</i>, what the Lord Jesus became.<a name=85:14></a> God hath made Him "both Lord and Christ.<a name=85:15></a>" You have the two in Psalm 110: "Jehovah said unto my Lord.<a name=85:16></a>" The distributive article, "a," is put in where, without it, the word gives the character of the person or thing spoken of.<a name=85:17></a> Thus, "a righteousness of God," so that you might think there were several, whereas, "righteousness of God," is in contrast with righteousness of man.<a name=85:18></a> In some cases this only drops the true force.<a name=85:19></a> "Paul an apostle," as one of many, instead of, "Paul, apostle of Jesus Christ," simply what he was.<a name=85:20></a>

		So they have added pronouns, which destroy the whole force of the scriptural statement.<a name=86:1></a> Thus they have added "our" to redemption -- "in whom we have our redemption" -- instead of, "redemption.<a name=86:2></a>" Now, "our" redemption is our personal deliverance -- a great and saving blessing surely -- but redemption is the great and stupendous work of the Saviour.<a name=86:3></a> I would add, before going further, that I can gather why they have used pronouns with it, namely, to distinguish it from the price of redemption, such as <i>antilutron</i> -- ransom price.<a name=86:4></a> But this does not in the least authorise the use of the pronoun not in scripture, raising a question as to its limits, and making it solely something about us, which scripture does not.<a name=86:5></a> The thing itself is lost, in its application to us, whoever we are.<a name=86:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		They have in no way the force of the preposition <i>en</i>, in Greek.<a name=86:7></a> Thus, "hath at the end of these days spoken to us in his Son," but that is not the force of "<i>in Son</i>"; difficult it may be to translate into English, and the margin is worse -- an example of their use of "a.<a name=86:8></a>" "<i>In Son</i>" is the character of the speaking, as contrasted with the prophets.<a name=86:9></a> The italics of this save the translation here a little; but it is as doing a thing <i>(en pneumati)</i>, in Spirit -- (en <i>sarki)</i>, in flesh.<a name=86:10></a> The Greek <i>en</i> has a very varied force, from its abstract nature, especially when used anarthrously; <i>i.<a name=86:11></a>e</i>.<a name=86:12></a>, without the article.<a name=86:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I take up some passages now which are crucial.<a name=86:14></a> First, Romans 1: 17.<a name=86:15></a> "Therein is revealed a righteousness of God" -- "a righteousness of God" I have already noted, it is as if there were several -- but "a righteousness of God by faith unto faith.<a name=86:16></a>" Now this changes the whole sense of the passage; the Greek has <i>apokaluptetai ek pisteos, is</i> revealed by faith, if "by" be used, but that is nonsense; so, to use "by," they have transferred <i>ek pisteos</i> to 'righteousness,' separating it from 'revealing.<a name=86:17></a>' The point is, it is righteousness <i>of God</i>, hence clearly not man's work -- it is revealed already, of course, in existence to be so.<a name=86:18></a> Is it revealed on the principle of man's works fitting him for it, or the means of getting it?<a name=86:19></a> Clearly not, or it would not be God's righteousness.<a name=86:20></a> Is it proclaimed on the principle of faith?<a name=86:21></a> whoever believes, then, has it, be he Greek or Jew.<a name=86:22></a> The whole statement of what made Paul not ashamed of the gospel is lost; the very hinge of all the truth is broken, the foundation-statement of the gospel gone.<a name=86:23></a> The righteousness is a righteousness by faith, something realised in man, not simply "God's righteousness.<a name=86:24></a>"

		In Colossians 1: 16 we have, "in him" (Christ), which has no sense at all.<a name=87:11></a> It is ignorance of the force of <i>en</i>.<a name=87:12></a> It is not 'by' as an instrument <i>(dia)</i>, but the power and energy, or character, of that which works -- difficult, I admit, to put in English, but they have made nonsense of it.<a name=87:13></a> That all things were created by Him is said in John 1; Hebrews 1.<a name=87:14></a> <i>En is</i> different; it is the one in, through, whose power a thing is done (Matthew 9: 34; Acts 17: 31).<a name=87:15></a> It is used generally for the character in which a thing is done, or the power.<a name=87:16></a> "All creation" (Colossians 1: 15); though I have much hesitated, I believe the change to be right.<a name=87:17></a> "Every creature" makes up the whole creation, but "every creature" takes up each individually; "all creation" takes it up as such, and sets Christ as Head over it as a whole; "first-born of every creature" sets Christ, no doubt, as first among them, but more, apparently, as one of themselves, and this has been used for mischief; but I notice it, as leaving without excuse their translation of Ephesians 2: 21, as the fruit of a doctrinal predilection, of which I will speak more fully further on.<a name=87:18></a> It is sad to see verse 19 (Colossians 1) retained -- a complete change in sense from the Greek, and utterly false.<a name=87:19></a> It states that the Father has willed about the whole Godhead, that it should dwell in the Man, Christ: the fact is found in chapter 2: 9, the thought of the Godhead, chapter 1: 19.<a name=87:20></a> To those acquainted with Gnostic follies, and Paul and John's use of the word, "the fulness," or "completeness," of Godhead has a distinct and unquestioned force.<a name=87:21></a>

		I am aware that 2 Corinthians 5: 14 and following is a controverted passage; but I cannot but regret that, where it is so, they should lead people wrong, as I have no doubt they have.<a name=88:1></a> The question is, is the true sense, "then had all died," or, practically, as in the Authorised Version, "then were all dead"?<a name=88:2></a> How does the love of Christ constrain him, as One dying for all, because saints have died to sin?<a name=88:3></a> But if all had died through Adam, Christ's descending into death for them all is that by which we know love.<a name=88:4></a> The apostle judged that if one died for all, it was because death was the condition of all; and what makes it to me incontrovertibly the sense is, that he speaks of "they that live" as a portion out of them, whereas, if it be the saints dying with Christ, they are the same people.<a name=88:5></a> It was not a Messiah of the Jews he now knew, but a Christ who had died for all because of their condition, and was now glorified.<a name=88:6></a> The revised passage is, moreover, nonsense -- "that one died for all, therefore all died.<a name=88:7></a>" How did Christ's dying for all make all die?<a name=88:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I take another example of fancied accuracy -- 1 John 4: 16: "We know, and have believed, the love that God hath in us," which has no sense at all.<a name=88:9></a> In the margin, you have sense made of it, but the translation is wrong, nor do I understand why they put the tenses of the verbs as they do.<a name=88:10></a> I quite admit the perfect may be sometimes translated by the present.<a name=88:11></a> In the case of the Greek "to possess" it is regularly done so: but why one should be present, and the other past, is hard to tell.<a name=88:12></a> It is done so, because the Greek perfect is what is clearly done, but which continues to be, and so is, a present; but here both verbs are perfect.<a name=88:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Galatians 2: 17 the force of the passage is greatly lost by not seeing the force of the absence of the article.<a name=88:14></a> "While" is all wrong; it should be "if, <i>in</i> seeking to be" -- then Christ is a minister of sin.<a name=88:15></a> "For I through law have died to law.<a name=88:16></a>" .<a name=88:17></a>.<a name=88:18></a>.<a name=88:19></a> "For if righteousness is through law.<a name=88:20></a>" So verse 16: "by works of law"; and "save" is very bad, for it would affirm we were, only that it was through faith it was so.<a name=88:21></a> So in chapter 3: 18: "law," but not "the" law.<a name=88:22></a> There is also a grave question as to the tenses; using imperfect for aorist may be right, no doubt, but may be wrong, as it in English implies a denial of the present: thus, Romans 12: 3, "the grace that was given" -- "has been," or simply "given.<a name=88:23></a>" Chapter 11: 31 maintains the old error, contradicting exactly what he is teaching.<a name=88:24></a>

		I now take an ordinary passage, where supposed refinement and exactitude has, in my judgment, injured their rendering of the passage, and what needed correction remains as it was, Philippians 1: 4 -- I believe a mistake in the stopping.<a name=89:2></a> "Always, in every prayer of mine, making," etc.<a name=89:3></a> So verse 7: "because you have me in your hearts.<a name=89:4></a>" Then, "Ye all are partakers with me in the grace," or "in my grace"; that is, took part in helping the activities of the gospel, as he goes on to say.<a name=89:5></a> Grace wrought in Paul in both service and suffering, and they shared with him in them.<a name=89:6></a> Verse 12, "have happened.<a name=89:7></a>" They are mistaken in fancying they can render the aorist by the English historical imperfect.<a name=89:8></a> There are no aorists in English, save as the only two tenses are often such in English.<a name=89:9></a> Here the effect remains, which is the Greek perfect.<a name=89:10></a> I speak of principle, for there is no verb here in verse 12; "things <i>concerning me</i>" -- "what concerns me has resulted .<a name=89:11></a>.<a name=89:12></a>.<a name=89:13></a> so that my bonds are become (or, abstractedly, should become) manifest.<a name=89:14></a>" The truth is, they have not understood what Paul was saying.<a name=89:15></a> Verse 22 has very little sense.<a name=89:16></a> Verse 26, we have the unhappy phrase -- "in Christ Jesus in me" -- in which I can see no meaning, it is, "as to me," "in my case," or "through.<a name=89:17></a>" This leads me to another case I lit upon, 1 John 4: 16: "We know, and have believed, the love that God hath in us.<a name=89:18></a>"

		In chapter 2: 25, "the life eternal" is simply wrong; the abstract use of a word has the article in Greek, not in English.<a name=89:19></a> So, in Ephesians 3: 21: "glory," not "the" glory; so, verse 7, next chapter.<a name=89:20></a> In using, "have ye been saved," Ephesians 2: 5, the real force of the perfect (present continuance) is greatly lost.<a name=89:21></a> "With him .<a name=89:22></a>.<a name=89:23></a>.<a name=89:24></a> in Christ Jesus" (verse 6) has no true sense.<a name=89:25></a> There is no "him" in Greek.<a name=89:26></a> Verse 13: "in" the blood is all wrong.<a name=89:27></a> I have no doubt that the "yet" of the Authorised Version, in Hebrews 4: 15, is a great mistake.<a name=89:28></a>

		I need not add any more, for this is no systematic criticism; then there might be often controversy, and the system of manuscripts, and modern judgment of them, would come in question.<a name=90:1></a> Nor is it saying there are no improvements, as words have been justly changed, as "lawlessness" put for <i>anomia</i> ("<i>transgression</i> of the law" -- Authorised Version); "judge" for "condemn" (John 5), and other changes, which give the sense more clearly.<a name=90:2></a> But, as a whole, it will be of no use to give the mind of God to one turning from the Authorised Version to search it, but often merely perplex him.<a name=90:3></a> In this respect, which would be its main practical use, it seems to me a total failure.<a name=90:4></a>

		It is a mistake to think that English tenses are simply grammatical expressions of time, or that they answer to Greek ones.<a name=90:11></a> The common use of auxiliary verbs makes them less such; for the auxiliary verb may be one time, the participle another, and give together the metaphysical force which connects both.<a name=90:12></a> 'We saw his star,' 'we have seen his star,' are not different in time, but vary in the force of the expression.<a name=90:13></a> One is the simple historical fact, what happened a long while ago; the other -- and these are much more striking and important -- is the present state of their minds, what rests upon them now, though the fact of seeing be passed.<a name=90:14></a> As to this last form, in general it would be taken for the perfect of the Greek, a past thing continuing.<a name=90:15></a> But to take it as regularly answering to it is a mistake.<a name=90:16></a> 'He took the city, but lost it the next day.<a name=90:17></a>' 'Took' is an aorist.<a name=90:18></a> It is a fact that happened, and no more -- past, no doubt, when I say so, but true in the past.<a name=90:19></a> If I said, 'He has taken the city,' it supposes he is in possession of it, because 'has' is present, and adds its force to taken -- he has taken possession of the city.<a name=90:20></a> But to apply this rule as constant would mislead.<a name=90:21></a> One says he lives (or is living, the true present) in London.<a name=90:22></a> I say, No, he has lived there; that 'lived' is a past participle; 'lived' is continuing, but 'has' here denies the present continuance; the continuance is in the past participle; 'has' only affirms as a present conviction of my mind, that once he did so continue to live there; 'has' affirms something presently, but the thing affirmed is past -- it is a past thing present in its moral force to my mind.<a name=90:23></a> 'He did live there' <i>affirms</i> that the fact is past.<a name=90:24></a> 'He has lived' is no affirmation of time, but of a fact in question, but being a fact must have previously existed, characterising him in that particular respect.<a name=90:25></a> If I say 'he has lived there a long time,' it supposes he lives there still.<a name=90:26></a> If I spoke of time past, I should say, 'he lived there a long time' -- this is an aorist.<a name=90:27></a> The other is an affirmation as to a fact characterising him, meeting the question whether he ever did -- 'he has.<a name=90:28></a>' It is a present truth, to my mind.<a name=90:29></a> 'He lived there,' 'did live there,' 'has lived there,' in themselves are all, as to the living the same time, but the mental effect quite different.<a name=90:30></a> I say 'in themselves,' because if I say, 'he has lived there nine years,' it goes up to the present time; on the contrary, 'he lived there nine years' supposes it was in past times, because 'lived' is historical and past; 'has' is present, and characterises the person.<a name=90:31></a> Thus the preterite -- or call it what you please -- is a past historical fact, that is all.<a name=90:32></a> 'I ate at his table' -- that is an historical fact.<a name=90:33></a> 'I have eaten at his table' is a characteristic, or, perhaps, questioned fact, an affirmation of intimacy.<a name=90:34></a> The difference is not one of time, but of mental or metaphysical force.<a name=90:35></a>

		At this moment I only occupy myself with the committal of all things to Christ as Son of God and Son of man, though our place in this scheme, as fully associated with the blessed Lord, may be the most precious to us, save His own glory in it.<a name=96:12></a> He came as the Heir of promise here on the earth, as Seed of David and Seed of Abraham as to His place, but personally the Revealer of the Father -- rejected because He really was so -- men not bearing light, though it came in love; John 15: 22-24; chapter 3: 19.<a name=96:13></a> But this gave occasion to the bringing forth the eternal counsels of God in the second Man, through death and redemption, from behind the working of man's responsibility under law and promise, His government of this world.<a name=96:14></a> For this, too, the cross must come in, because of man's sin (hatred against God in goodness, as well as breaking the law), because of God's glory (John 13: 31, 32), that the promises made to Abraham without condition, might be forfeited -- forfeited by man -- yet fulfilled hereafter in the second Man, but all lost as to the first man by his rejection of Him in whom they were.<a name=96:15></a> The cross closed up the history of the first man, and the world was judged (John 12: 31), and then, through redemption and the glorifying God, God's history began in the second Man in a new state, risen from the dead -- sin, death, Satan's power, God's judgment, all passed through, and left behind, a place and state beyond them all, God being perfectly glorified; John 13: 31, 32.<a name=96:16></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#96:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>Chapter 13 gives the ground in God's righteousness, and the wider general place given of the Father. In chapter 17 it is the Son's title, and the place of sons with Him, and first of all the disciples, and that on to their glory.

		Now, the fulfilment of the counsels of God as to the glory, always comes after this, and necessarily must.<a name=97:1></a> As regards the Person of the Lord, His title and competency were ever complete; but that is not the question, but of the accomplishment of it in His manhood.<a name=97:2></a> Thus, if He created all things, as He did, they were created for Him as well as by Him, but not to take them as man in their corruption.<a name=97:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So, as Son He is Heir of all things; Hebrews 1.<a name=97:4></a> His given glory is a consequence there, and as to His title as Son of man, though personally glorified, the psalm (as we see in Hebrews 2) is not fulfilled; and as to the earthly royal part (Revelation 11: 17), we have -- as indeed many parables and passages teach us -- the testimony that He has not taken it.<a name=97:5></a> Psalm 110, too, is simple and plain on this point.<a name=97:6></a> David's Son was to sit at God's right hand as David's Lord till the time came.<a name=97:7></a>

		In Acts 2: 36 we have a passage rightly, I believe, translated, but which shews the fallacy of their rule, the observance of which in John 17 has deprived <i>it</i> of all its force.<a name=109:11></a> "God hath made this Jesus whom ye crucified both Lord and Christ" -- one of the verbs they translate by a preterite, the other by 'has,' and the participle.<a name=109:12></a> But this passage proves also clearly an ignorance of Greek, which has destroyed the sense of a passage, which, if not fundamental, is one of the richest parts of the structure of truth -- Ephesians 2: 21, where they have translated "every building," not, "all the building.<a name=109:13></a>" One would have thought that the whole tenor of the passage which insists on the middle wall of partition being broken down, and both reconciled in one body to God, would have guarded them from such a blunder -- for blunder it is, but a blunder affecting the whole doctrine of the church, the absence of unity being ostentatiously put forward in the epistle consecrated to its establishment.<a name=109:14></a> Every tyro knows that, as a general thing, <i>pas</i> in Greek, with an article, is 'the whole' -- without it, 'every,' but to make it an absolute rule is only ignorance.<a name=109:15></a> The received text has it, with very good authorities, as A,C,P, correction of the Sinaiticus, and many others; and if not the original reading, it was added to make plain what the Revisers have set aside.<a name=109:16></a> But it is false that it is a universal rule as to <i>pas</i>.<a name=109:17></a> Where there is a genitive which determines, the article is left out -- for example, "every house of Israel," is nonsense on the face of it; indeed, where the noun stands as a composite whole in itself, no article is added, as Romans 1: 29.<a name=109:18></a> <i>Oikodome</i> (building), though one word, is a composite word, and <i>oikos</i> is a practical genitive after <i>dome</i>, and the whole word a composite whole in itself.<a name=109:19></a> The doctrine is false.<a name=109:20></a> No particular church is the habitation of God through the Spirit; nor can what is said of <i>oikodome</i> here be said of any particular church, that each is growing to a holy temple.<a name=109:21></a> Was Thyatira doing so?<a name=109:22></a> Was Laodicea doing so?<a name=109:23></a> to say nothing of Ephesus and Sardis.<a name=109:24></a> And where are all the early Christian churches?<a name=109:25></a> The attempt to make it "every house," in Acts 2: 36 (marg.<a name=109:26></a>), is a want of common sense, and ignorance of Greek.<a name=109:27></a>

		I confess I am surprised with men, some of whom (and, I doubt not, others whom I do not know, are so) I sincerely believe to be much better Hellenists than myself, that such evidence of want of scholarship should crop up.<a name=110:1></a> They have not attempted it -- not even in the margin -- in Romans 11; it would have been too absurd; and in Ephesians 2 there was doctrinal purpose, for they have, "each several building," and "every building," in the margin.<a name=110:2></a> Why, if "every" was a universally binding rule, as to the meaning, not stick to it?<a name=110:3></a> But to make it, after the verses 19 and 20, from which it cannot be separated, "each several building" is perversion, not translation.<a name=110:4></a> <i>Oikodome</i> is not a classical word, and does not receive an article at all, but in special cases, even where we might expect it, in Greek -- only three times in the New Testament, where it is plural, and refers to the various constructions of the temple: Romans 14: 19, where it is specified in character by the Greek article following, not used in the abstract, and 2 Corinthians 12: 19, where it is also specially determined by the Greek pronoun for <i>your</i>.<a name=110:5></a> Taken simply it qualifies the act, and is not a direct specified fact; nor does an article after <i>pas</i> always make it signify 'the whole,' but distinctly the contrary, as with participles, as Romans 2: 10; chapter 10: 4; chapter 1: 16.<a name=110:6></a> It characterises <i>pas; so</i> Romans 12: 3; but I need not multiply instances.<a name=110:7></a> There is another case, where <i>pas</i> is used without an article, not in the sense of 'every': moral ideas, which embrace a number of thoughts or acts composing the idea, as people compose the house of Israel; as "in all goodness and righteousness and truth"; Ephesians 5: 9; "all deceit," Acts 13: 10; where there are four other cases; "all wisdom and understanding," Colossians 1: 9, and "all power" verse 11; "all lowliness," Ephesians 4: 2; "all fear," 1 Peter 2: 18; "all honour," 1 Timothy 6: 1; "all joy," James 1: 2.<a name=110:8></a> Probably others which are not recorded in the books which furnished me with these.<a name=110:9></a> 'Whole,' in the sense of <i>holos</i>, which is often used, would not do; nor would 'every'; the thought is composite, and "all" is justly used, but 'every' would be false, as in <i>power, lowliness, fear, so</i> in "joy and peace," in Romans 15: 13, where compare "the hope," in the same verse.<a name=110:10></a> To make <i>pas</i> without an article, as necessarily always 'every,' is a blunder, and in the Revision it is put in the margin, Acts 2: 36, as we have seen, as if this were the case, where it would be simple nonsense.<a name=110:11></a> 'All,' and in German allerlei, which Luther uses, specially the English, all convey the meaning.<a name=110:12></a> I had nearly forgotten one instance of a different character -- <i>flesh</i>, used as denoting men, in Matthew 24: 22, etc.<a name=110:13></a>, in English, 'no flesh' -- an article could not be used.<a name=110:14></a> It is, again, a word embracing many individuals in one thought, "all flesh," and then, viewed as a whole, the verb as to it, negatived what is said.<a name=110:15></a>

		Let me add here, as the subject has been before us in the passage, that we must not confound the "house" (church) built by man, according to 1 Corinthians 3, and the "house of God" built by Christ (Matthew 16), against which the gates of hell cannot prevail.<a name=111:1></a> The latter is found in the passage which occupies us (Ephesians 2: 21), Matthew 16, and 1 Peter 2-1 am not aware of any other place.<a name=111:2></a> In these it is Christ who builds, or no one else is spoken of; the "living stones" come, or "the house" grows.<a name=111:3></a>

		The more their use of the word <i>en</i> is examined, the more erroneous it will be found.<a name=111:4></a> In 1 Corinthians 8: 11 they have been forced to put 'through'; in chapter 6: 11, 'in,' as to the Spirit, hardly makes sense; but such passages as Colossians 1: 16, 17, as indeed others, are not only wrong, but shew they have not seized the force of <i>en</i>, where not used locally or materially at all.<a name=111:5></a> Compare 2 Corinthians 6, where <i>en</i> and <i>dia</i>, and a third reciting form are used, with substantially the same sense; in <i>en</i> and <i>dia</i>, the latter with the genitive is the instrumental means, <i>en</i> the character or power of that in which a thing is done.<a name=111:6></a> Either would often do.<a name=111:7></a> 'His graciousness was shewn by his kindness to those who deserved nothing, in his kindness to,' etc.<a name=111:8></a> -- either would do; not that they ever mean the same; one was the means of shewing; the other, the character of that 'in' ('by,' 'through') which it was shewn, but the result is the same.<a name=111:9></a> They are really changed for style in 2 Corinthians 6; one may suit one word better than the other, but, 'in much patience,' or 'by much patience,' though not the same idea, if analysed, is the same thing: in verse 7, "through the arms of righteousness," <i>en</i> would not do so well, and the apostle changes to <i>dia</i>, and then uses it four times, where <i>en</i> would do very well, and where <i>dia</i> has pretty much the sense of <i>en</i> -- his mouth was opened.<a name=111:10></a> But for this reason -- to make <i>en</i> mean simply 'in' is a gross mistake.<a name=111:11></a> "In spirit" -- "in flesh" have a sense difficult to put in English, but which in many cases 'in' could not render.<a name=111:12></a> I pray "in <i>(en)</i> spirit"; so 2 Corinthians 7: 1, "in <i>(en)</i> the fear of God.<a name=111:13></a>" Here the English use of 'in' answers to <i>en</i>, but it is characteristic of the moral state in which the perfecting was done.<a name=111:14></a>

		I may cite some passages to shew a false licence in translating, which wholly spoils and destroys the sense.<a name=113:7></a> Thus, Ephesians 2: 6, they have added 'him,' which is not in the Greek at all, and makes nonsense of the passage, "made us to sit with him [Christ] in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.<a name=113:8></a>" The passage means that the Jew by nature is a child of wrath, like the Gentile, being quickened with Christ, is raised with (the Gentile), a state in which there is no difference -- both are sitting in heavenly places 'in' Him; 'with' Him, neither are Then, in Romans 5: 1, I have not the smallest doubt that "<i>we have</i>" should never have been changed into "let us have" -- indeed the Fathers, who quote it thus, cannot give a simple sense to it, and I affirm that it has <i>none</i>.<a name=113:9></a> 'Let us have peace.<a name=113:10></a>' What does that mean?<a name=113:11></a> I am exhorted to have peace with God.<a name=113:12></a> How?<a name=113:13></a> And in what state is the Christian, or any one, when he is exhorted?<a name=113:14></a> Grace was at once forgotten after the apostles were gone -- often before, as Galatians shews -- and all made to depend on man; but He has made peace by the blood of His cross.<a name=113:15></a> They have not ventured to accept the reading, "we should bear," 1 Corinthians 15: 49 (which would have made nonsense); yet, though they have the Vatican MSS.<a name=113:16></a> (corrected) for "let us have" in Romans 5: 1, not for "we should bear," they have the Sinaiticus and others for the latter.<a name=113:17></a> I am glad they have not accepted it, but the reasons were not the manuscripts, but the spiritual absurdity of our being called to bear the glorious image of Christ here.<a name=113:18></a> But Tischendorf, 8th edition (not 7th), and Tregelles give us "we should bear" they go by manuscripts; spiritual apprehension would have taken "we have" in Romans 5 too; Tischendorf, till the Sinaiticus MSS.<a name=113:19></a> influenced him, had this.<a name=113:20></a>

		I do not doubt the value of the Sinaitic and the Vatican manuscripts, but I do not accept their authority as conclusive; I confine myself therefore to the translation, and I must say, that I judge it to be a bad book, and that those who trust to it will lose in their knowledge of divine truth.<a name=115:1></a> I do not see the Spirit of God owned, nor the effect of owning it produced, nor the acquaintance with the mind of God drawn from Scripture, which qualifies for the performance of it, and the discovery of the force of particular passages.<a name=115:2></a> It is private interpretation, and very often only such.<a name=115:3></a> Much is lost by needless changes in the language, but this is a trifle comparatively.<a name=115:4></a> I will instance, "Jesus advanced in wisdom and stature.<a name=115:5></a>" Authorised Version, "increased"; the sense is the same; but, besides the prestige of the old, the change is for the worse.<a name=115:6></a> I take this merely as an example.<a name=115:7></a> I believe that a person who takes it up for his daily use will injure his own soul.<a name=115:8></a> I have no doubt that Ephesians 5: 13 is wrong.<a name=115:9></a> Whatever "is made manifest is light" is not merely not true, but it is not the object of the passage -- it is speaking of being made manifest by the light.<a name=115:10></a> I admit the passage is difficult, but I believe the sense to be, "what makes everything manifest is light"; or, "it is the light which makes everything manifest": the form of the Greek word is found only here, and would be a middle with an active sense.<a name=115:11></a> There is no article with pan (everything); the sense would be different, and out of place -- it would be the universe.<a name=115:12></a> Philippians 2: 4 is, I believe, a mistake.<a name=115:13></a> What he seeks is, owning the good and gifts in others.<a name=115:14></a> Verse 10: 'At' is the sense -- 'in' has none.<a name=115:15></a> What is "bowing in his name"?<a name=115:16></a> They violate their rule of the preterite twice over: Acts 2: 36; Romans 6: 7.<a name=115:17></a> "United with him by the likeness" (verse 5) gives no sense.<a name=115:18></a> What does 'unite by a likeness' mean?<a name=115:19></a> No one who knew what being livingly united by the Holy Ghost to Christ is, could have penned such a sentence.<a name=115:20></a> "Be in bondage to sin" is not what is said; verse 6.<a name=115:21></a> In verse 10, "The death that he died" is not what is said; the margin, or old translation, is alone right.<a name=115:22></a> Verse 16: "Present yourselves" is very bad; 'yield,' or 'give up,' or 'deliver up.<a name=115:23></a>' Verse 4: "through the glory" is also bad -- better, as in the Authorised Version, "by.<a name=115:24></a>" Verse 17: "Ye have been instructed," the commonest use of the Greek word with Paul.<a name=115:25></a> Chapter 7: 3, 4: "joined" better left out.<a name=115:26></a> Verse 13: "by" not in Greek -- better left out.<a name=115:27></a> Chapter 8: 4: "ordinance" very bad; in walking after the Spirit the righteous requirement of the law is fulfilled.<a name=115:28></a> Verse 5, and elsewhere -- Spirit with a small s misleads and confuses; their rule for it is badly imagined.<a name=115:29></a> "They that walk after the spirit, mind the things of the spirit," Romans 8: 5; and then "the Spirit of God"; and even there "in the spirit" (verse 9) with a small s.<a name=115:30></a> Romans 8: 26,27: "how" is wrong, and the big S here makes the little one totally wrong elsewhere, and seriously so.<a name=115:31></a>

		The first parable is, indeed, the word of the kingdom, though not a similitude of the kingdom.<a name=118:14></a> The point in question is the reception of this word in the heart, not the establishment of the kingdom in this world.<a name=118:15></a> There are four classes: the careless hearer; here, just as the birds pick up the seed sown by the wayside, so the devil takes away the word sown in careless hearts, for the word coming from God's heart is adapted to man's heart.<a name=118:16></a> Next comes a heart receiving the word with joy.<a name=118:17></a> The glad tidings of the kingdom, and of divine blessing, rejoice the heart, but the conscience is untouched; there is not consequently any root, and when persecution and tribulation arise on account of the word, as the careless one had only received it for the joy it brought him, he renounces it on account of the tribulation that ensues.<a name=118:18></a> There is no fruit.<a name=118:19></a> A third case appeared to give hope of the seed germinating, but the briers and thorns choke it; cares, the love of riches, do not allow the word to bring fruit to maturity.<a name=118:20></a> Finally, the seed falls into good ground, there is spiritual intelligence; the heart understands the word, it receives it; then it produces more or less fruit in each one.<a name=118:21></a> The cases are not presented as declaring the doctrine of grace and of the operation of the Spirit, no -- the contrary, but the actual result that is manifested as the effect of the sowing of the word.<a name=118:22></a> Still, these various cases are placed by the Lord before the conscience.<a name=118:23></a> He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.<a name=118:24></a>

		Then come the parables of the kingdom.<a name=119:1></a> The first three present the external appearance of the kingdom, what it becomes to the world's view.<a name=119:2></a> The first of these three adds the separation of the wicked from among the righteous; it ends by the order being given to the reapers to gather the good seed into the granary.<a name=119:3></a> Save the fact announced by the Lord, that the wheat was, according to His orders, to be gathered into the garner, we have in these parables only the public effect in the world of the establishment of the kingdom of heaven; that is to say, of the kingdom of God while the King remains hidden in heaven, and has not yet either taken His great power, or acted as Ring, so that the kingdom without a recognised or manifested king, progresses, takes certain forms which testify of the Ring's absence, and makes its way as though He was not occupied with it, although He, in reality, does act, in His grace, to call His own, and make them grow.<a name=119:4></a> (Compare Mark 4: 26-29.<a name=119:5></a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Son of man sows good seed (the word of God).<a name=119:6></a> While men sleep, Satan comes, and sows tares where the good seed had been sown.<a name=119:7></a> It is not the natural condition of a heathen or unbelieving heart; it is what Satan has introduced among real Christians, to spoil the crop on earth.<a name=119:8></a> He cannot injure the good seed, nor prevent its being gathered into the garner, but in this world the crop is spoiled.<a name=119:9></a> This must last till the time of harvest.<a name=119:10></a> Then the Son of man will again personally occupy Himself with it.<a name=119:11></a> In the meantime His servants are not to be occupied with the tares in the world, with the purpose of purifying the crop in the world.<a name=119:12></a> Their business is not with the tares; the crop, once spoiled, remains spoiled to the end.<a name=119:13></a> But this refers to the state of the crop in the world, that is, to Christianity.<a name=119:14></a> We have nothing to do here with the church, the assembly of God.<a name=119:15></a> Here the good seed is not united into an assembly.<a name=119:16></a> At the time of harvest all will be put in order.<a name=119:17></a> In rooting up the tares of the field (the world), one might also pluck up the good seed; it is just what occurred when Rome wanted to destroy the heretics.<a name=119:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The second parable presents the kingdom as a great power in the earth.<a name=120:1></a> (See Daniel 4.<a name=120:2></a>) This is what a great tree is always a figure of in Scripture, as Assyria, Egypt.<a name=120:3></a> The seed of the word, in appearance insignificant at the beginning, has in fact become a great, and even the greatest, power on earth.<a name=120:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The third of our parables -- that of the leaven -- shews not an individual and real effect, as was the case in that of the sower, where the effect disappears when the word does not take root in the conscience; but it is a question of a general influence, which completely fills a limited sphere.<a name=120:5></a> Moreover a term (leaven) is used, which <i>everywhere else</i> has the sense of corruption.<a name=120:6></a> This is Christianity again.<a name=120:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		After this the Lord sends the multitudes away, re-enters the house, and there speaks only to His disciples.<a name=120:8></a> He explains the parable of the tares, then adds three others.<a name=120:9></a> We have some remarks to make on the Lord's explanation of the parable of the tares <i>and the field</i>.<a name=120:10></a> (Verses 36-43; compare verse 24-30.<a name=120:11></a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The judgment of God manifests publicly what is only spiritually known before the judgment.<a name=120:12></a> Thus every explanation of parables and prophecies introduces elements which are not to be found in the parable or prophecy itself.<a name=120:13></a> Here the tares, already bound into bundles (in masses associated together and remaining on the field), are cast into the fire.<a name=120:14></a> Christ, by an earthly judgment, takes out of His kingdom all things that offend, and them that do iniquity.<a name=120:15></a> The earthly part of the kingdom is purified.<a name=120:16></a> Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.<a name=120:17></a> This is the heavenly part; then the kingdom of heaven will present two distinct parts -- the kingdom of the Father above, and that of the Son of man below.<a name=120:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=121>[Page 121]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The three parables which follow (verse 44-50) shew the intention of Christ, and divine intelligence, in these things.<a name=121:1></a> The field is purchased to obtain the treasure.<a name=121:2></a> Christ has bought (not redeemed) the world to possess His own.<a name=121:3></a> His power over those who refuse His rights will be manifested in judgment, but this is not the subject of the parable.<a name=121:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next (verse 45, 46), the moral beauty of the church engages His affections.<a name=121:5></a> He seeks what is lovely.<a name=121:6></a> There He finds it.<a name=121:7></a> In these two cases He renounces all His rights as Messiah Son of God on the earth, to the promises as Son of David, and come in the flesh.<a name=121:8></a> He went so far as to empty Himself of everything, to have the fruit of His humiliation in the glory of His own, the fruit of the travail of His soul.<a name=121:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Finally (verse 47-50), the kingdom takes at the end the character of a net thrown into the sea, and which gathers every kind of fish, good and bad.<a name=121:10></a> The subject is Christianity, which does not embrace all the people of the world, but a limited number, although composed of all sorts of men.<a name=121:11></a> Here the fishermen are employed in separating, and again the divine purpose is found that would have good fish, whereas the fishermen's labours have collected all sorts; however, they separate the good.<a name=121:12></a> This is what they sought, and they leave the others there.<a name=121:13></a> Then the explanation goes outside (the parable) to judgment.<a name=121:14></a> The angels separate, not the good from the bad, but the evil from among the good; then the bad are thrown into the furnace of fire.<a name=121:15></a> The act of the fishers is one of spiritual intelligence, when Christianity is formed as it is at present.<a name=121:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus you have in a few words, dear brother, the true sense, I believe, of these parables, full of instruction for us.<a name=121:17></a> The scribe, instructed in the things of the kingdom, possesses, indeed, that which the prophets announced; and he adds to it explanations which are the fruit of the coming and of the rejection of Christ -- facts which give the kingdom a form which is presented to us in these parables.<a name=121:18></a>

		A NOTE ON THE PARABLES OF THE TREASURE AND THE NET
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>To the Editor of an American periodical</i>.<a name=122:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Will you allow me to call in question some details of your explanation of the parables of Matthew 13?<a name=122:2></a> No matter of faith is in question, or indeed of doctrine, in any way, for I suppose on this we are quite agreed, but merely the interpretation of certain passages; but we lose by any mistake in this, and Scripture is too precious to allow of it, when in a form that acts on souls, for we are sanctified by the truth.<a name=122:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I suppose that the kingdom of heaven, in the six parables in which it is here spoken of, means the same thing.<a name=122:4></a> It is the subject of comparison.<a name=122:5></a> It may be, and is, viewed in various aspects, but the thing compared is the same.<a name=122:6></a> Your interpretation of the last makes of it an entirely new dispensation, when Christ has taken to Him His great power, and is reigning and judging; or, at least, you mix these two together as one.<a name=122:7></a> I am not aware that, though "the heavens rule," the term "kingdom of heaven," is applied to the earthly dominion of the Son of man.<a name=122:8></a> The Son of man gathers out of His kingdom all things that offend, and them that do iniquity, and the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.<a name=122:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It has been long ago noticed that the first three of these parables present the outward apparent effects of the gospel in the world, the last three the thoughts of God in it; one, the result in man's responsibility; the other, the intention of God.<a name=122:10></a> We get the manifested effect on earth in the first three.<a name=122:11></a> The crop spoiled in the world, and to be left so till the harvest; the spread of a common doctrine in place of individual conversion, and that doctrine corrupt; a great power in the earth.<a name=122:12></a> Hence, in the <i>parable</i>, the tares are only gathered together in bundles on the earth, and the wheat gathered into the garner.<a name=122:13></a> The scene has ceased on earth, save that the tares are gathered in bundles for judgment.<a name=122:14></a> The wheat has disappeared there.<a name=122:15></a> Then God's actual judgment in power explains what now is known only spiritually.<a name=122:16></a> Hence the explanation of symbolical prophecy and parables always goes further than the parable or prophecy, because these give the facts in their enigmatic form, which the spiritual mind alone can explain.<a name=122:17></a> In actual judgment all is manifest.<a name=122:18></a> In the <i>explanation</i>, the tares are cast into the fire, which they were not in the parable, and the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.<a name=122:19></a> The parable closes with the closing of the public state of things in the world -- the closing of the present state of things.<a name=122:20></a> The explanation (not the parable) gives the judgment of God on the wicked, and the shining forth in glory of the saints.<a name=122:21></a> The Son of man in judgment gathers out of His kingdom all things that offend.<a name=122:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the last three parables we have the mind of the Lord in what took place; and first, it seems to me, in contrast with Judaism.<a name=123:1></a> Judaism, and Israel itself, was no hidden treasure, no mystery of the kingdom.<a name=123:2></a> The Lord gave up nothing to have it.<a name=123:3></a> They were His known people and inheritance in the world.<a name=123:4></a> He came to His own, though His own received Him not.<a name=123:5></a> When He comes again, He will take them to have the world, not the world to have them.<a name=123:6></a> In no case has the Lord, it seems to me, taken the world to have the Jews.<a name=123:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To come more directly to what drew my attention to these statements, or (to speak more exactly) to which my attention was drawn, the net cast into the sea.<a name=123:8></a> I cannot receive the thought, that it refers to the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom, after the church is gone.<a name=123:9></a> As to <i>the facts</i> of that day, and that the preaching will take place, we are agreed.<a name=123:10></a> It is to the parable and its explanation that I refer.<a name=123:11></a> In the tares you have the position of the kingdom in the world.<a name=123:12></a> It is not the work of Christ and the Spirit for His own objects.<a name=123:13></a> Simply the facts, and the result, till the close of all here.<a name=123:14></a> They are found as such in the world, and dealt with.<a name=123:15></a> In the parable of the net, the net is cast into the masses of population, the sea, and gathers out, the object being good fishes, though the net enclosed all; but they are taken out of the sea, and brought to be handled by the fishermen who drew the net.<a name=123:16></a> In the parable of the tares there is no gathering a company into one net-full, with which the fishermen are occupied.<a name=123:17></a> The whole, in the case of the net, is their work.<a name=123:18></a> In the tares it is the Lord's, and Satan's, who spoils it in its effects on earth, though he cannot injure the wheat, or hinder its being put into the garner.<a name=123:19></a> It is the effect in the world till harvest, with the fact that the wheat is hid in the garner.<a name=123:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=124>[Page 124]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Further, in the gospel of the kingdom, when the church is gone, there is no gathering a net-full of good and bad.<a name=124:1></a> All is individual; and in the judgment, all the world is brought together, without exception; not a net-full gathered, and the separation made between those only who are in it, the mass of fishes being left in the sea.<a name=124:2></a> The kingdom of heaven, the subject of all these parables, never embraces all the world, but is a partial thing -- save buying the field to have the treasure hidden in it, which makes the special object more distinct, but the operation of the Lord is partial.<a name=124:3></a> The field is the world, but the operation is sowing, and tares, and a treasure which is there; but in the parable of the sheep and goats it is expressly all the Gentiles who are gathered, and no partial collective operation at all.<a name=124:4></a> Nor am I, indeed, aware that the throne of judgment set up on earth is ever called the kingdom.<a name=124:5></a> The parable of Matthew 25: 31 seems to me to make a clear distinction.<a name=124:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Besides this, the comparison of the use made of the sea does not seem to me to seize the true use of these figures.<a name=124:7></a> In Isaiah the wicked are like the troubled sea, casting up mire and dirt.<a name=124:8></a> This is a special action of the surf, and the wicked are viewed in this character, and compared to it.<a name=124:9></a> That is another idea from the vast sea of nations, out of which a net-full of fishes is taken, good as well as bad.<a name=124:10></a> The sea and the fishes of the sea are distinct things; and it is a different thing to bring up all the nations -- everybody -- for judgment, and to gather every kind and leave the mass of the rest where they were.<a name=124:11></a> There is no bringing to shore in the judgment of the nations, before the judgment, but a gathering of all together.<a name=124:12></a> The fish are brought out of the sea into a net: that is the fishing work.<a name=124:13></a> I do not enter on the analogies of the days of creation, as not necessary to my object; but I think in the remark, that this subject occupies thirteen out of twenty-two chapters of Revelation, there is confusion between the beast and the Gentiles outside.<a name=124:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have only one more remark to make, already alluded to as a principle.<a name=124:15></a> The <i>statement</i> of the parable is overlooked, and confounded with the explanation.<a name=124:16></a> In the parable of the net, as in the tares and wheat, the explanation is, and is meant to be, different from the parable.<a name=124:17></a> In the parable it is carefully stated that the persons who separate are the persons who have drawn the net: "which when they had drawn to shore, they sat down, and put the good into vessels.<a name=124:18></a>" They are occupied with the good, and simply reject the bad.<a name=124:19></a> In the explanation, the angels -- certainly not the fishermen -- separate the wicked from among the just -- another kind of act -- and cast them into the fire.<a name=124:20></a> In the parable we have the fishermen's work carried out to the end of the fishermen's part in it.<a name=124:21></a> The two previous parables give the thought and purpose of God in the kingdom of heaven; this, the part His servants take in it.<a name=124:22></a> In the tares, further, you have no action of men, but of Christ, and Satan, and then judgment in this world, providential and actual, the wheat being gone out of the way into the garner.<a name=124:23></a> The gathering into the net, and out of it into vessels, is a distinct part of the parabolic action, and done by the fishermen.<a name=124:24></a> In the parable of the tares and wheat, the servants are forbidden to meddle with what is to be done, and the work of judgment, which is all, save the Lord's and Satan's, committed to others.<a name=124:25></a> <br>J.<a name=124:26></a> N.<a name=124:27></a> D.<a name=124:28></a>

		ON THE GOSPEL OF JOHN
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		INTRODUCTION
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Gospel of John has a special character, which has struck the minds of all those who have given it a little attention, even though they have not always clearly understood what it was that produced this effect: it not only strikes the mind, but attracts the heart in a way not to be found in the other parts of the holy book.<a name=126:1></a> The reason of this is, that the Gospel of John presents the Person of the Son of God -- the Son of God come down so low, that He can say, "Give me to drink.<a name=126:2></a>" This attracts the heart, if the heart be not altogether hardened.<a name=126:3></a> If Paul teaches us how a man can be presented before God, John presents God before man.<a name=126:4></a> His subject is God, and eternal life in a man, the apostle following out the subject in the Epistle, shewing us this life reproduced in those who possess it in possessing Christ.<a name=126:5></a> I speak only of the leading features which characterise these books; for many other truths besides those which I have just noticed are to be found in them, it is needless to say.<a name=126:6></a> Indeed it is John's Gospel which gives us the doctrine of the sending of the Spirit of God, that other Comforter, who is to abide with us for ever.<a name=126:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Gospel of John is very clearly distinguished from the other three synoptical gospels, and we shall do well to pause for a moment to consider the character of these last, especially as this concerns the difference between them and the Gospel of John.<a name=126:8></a> The three synoptical gospels, Matthew, Mark, and Luke, afford the most precious details of the life of the Saviour down here, of His patience and His grace: He was the perfect expression of good in the midst of evil; His miracles (with the exception of the cursing of the fig-tree, which expressed the truth as to the state of Israel, that is, of man in possession of all the privileges which man could enjoy from God) were not only a confirmation of His testimony, but were all miracles of goodness -- the expression of divine power manifested in goodness.<a name=126:9></a> Here we find good; God Himself, who is love, acting, although, in a certain sense, still hidden, according to the grace which was soon to be plainly revealed.<a name=126:10></a> Thus was the blessed Saviour presented to man, to be recognized and received: He was unknown and rejected.<a name=126:11></a> It has often been noticed that each of the three evangelists presents the Saviour in a different aspect: Matthew brings before us Emmanuel in the midst of the Jews; Mark, the Servant Prophet; Luke (after the first two chapters, which present to us the most interesting picture of a remnant with whom God was, in the midst of a hypocritical and rebellious people) gives us the Son of man, more in relation with that which exists at present; that is, heavenly grace; but all three, in the main, present the Saviour in His patient ways of grace in this world, that man may receive Him; and man rejected Him!<a name=126:12></a> Mark's Gospel, relating the service of Jesus, has no genealogy.<a name=126:13></a> Matthew, in relation with the Jews and earthly dispensations, traces the Saviour from Abraham and David, and also shews the three things, which take the place of Judaism; that is, the kingdom as it exists in the present time (chapter 13), the church (chapter 16), and the kingdom in glory (chapter 17).<a name=126:14></a> Luke, which presents to us grace in the Son of man, follows His genealogy up to Adam.<a name=126:15></a> These three Gospels always speak of Christ as a Man down here, presented to men historically, and they follow up their account until He is positively rejected, announcing then His entering into the new position which He has taken by resurrection.<a name=126:16></a> The ascension, which is the foundation of our present place, is only given in Luke directly; allusion to it is made in the last supplementary verses in Mark.<a name=126:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Gospel of John regards the Lord in quite another manner: it presents to us a divine Person come down here, God manifested in this world; a marvellous fact, upon which all in man's history depends.<a name=127:1></a> It is no longer a question here of genealogy; it is no longer the second Man responsible toward God (though that be ever true), and perfect before God, and all His delight, while we see upon every page that it is no longer Messiah according to prophecy; it is no longer Emmanuel, Jesus, who saves His people; it is no longer the messenger who goes before His face: in John it is God Himself, as God, who in a Man shews Himself to men,<a href="#127:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> to the Jews -- for God had promised Him -- but first of all to put them entirely aside (chapter 1: 10, 11), shewing at the same time that nothing in man could even comprehend who was there present with him.<a name=127:2></a> Then, at the end of the Gospel, we find the doctrine of the presence of the Holy Spirit, who should replace Jesus here below, in revealing His glory on high, and in giving us the consciousness of our relationships with the Father and with Him.<a name=127:3></a> It is also to be remarked that all John's writings, and amongst them his Gospel, look upon the Christian as an individual, and do not recognise the church, either as the body or as the house.<a name=127:4></a> Further, the Gospel of John treats of eternal life; he does not speak of forgiveness of sins, except as a present administration confided to the apostles; and, as far as Christ is concerned, he treats essentially the subject of the manifestation of God down here, and of the coming of eternal life in the Person of the Son of God; consequently he hardly speaks at all of our heavenly portion, three or four allusions excepted.<a name=127:5></a> But it is time to leave these general reflections, to consider what the Gospel itself teaches us.<a name=127:6></a>

		First of all, then, let us look at its structure.<a name=128:1></a> The first three chapters are preliminary: John had not yet been put in prison, and Jesus, although He taught and performed miracles, had not yet begun His public ministry.<a name=128:2></a> The two first of these three chapters, up to chapter 2: 22, form a whole.<a name=128:3></a> Chapter 3 gives us the basis of the divine work in us and for us -- that is, the new birth and the cross, this latter introducing heavenly things as to us, and as to Jesus Himself.<a name=128:4></a> In chapter 4, Jesus passes from Judea into Galilee, leaving the Jews who did not receive Him, and takes the place of Saviour of the world in grace.<a name=128:5></a> In chapter 5 He gives life as Son of God; in chapter 6, He becomes, as Son of man, the sustenance of the life, in His incarnation and in His death.<a name=128:6></a> Chapter 7 shews us that the Holy Spirit should replace Him -- the feast of tabernacles, the re-establishment of Israel, to take place later on.<a name=128:7></a> In chapter 8, His word is definitely rejected; in chapter 9, His works: but he who has received sight follows Him.<a name=128:8></a> Thus, in chapter 10, He will have His sheep, and keep them for better things to come.<a name=128:9></a> In chapters 11 and 12, God bears witness to Him, as Son of God, by the resurrection of Lazarus; as Son of David, by His entry into Jerusalem; as Son of man, by the coming of the Greeks; but this title of Son of man, brought in with it death, a subject which is then treated of.<a name=128:10></a> Bethany is a scene by itself; Mary seized in her heart the position of Jesus; He who gave life must Himself die.<a name=128:11></a> His title of Son of man closes the history of Jesus down here, introducing Him by death and by redemption into a far wider sphere of glory.<a name=128:12></a> But then (chapter 13) the question arose naturally, Was Jesus going to leave His disciples?<a name=128:13></a> No; being glorified on high, He would wash their feet.<a name=128:14></a> But whither He went the disciples could not follow Him now.<a name=128:15></a> In chapter 14 we find the resources of comfort during the time of the Lord's absence: the Father had been revealed in Him already during His life down here; when He should have gone back on high, He would send another Comforter; by His means, the disciples would know that He was in the Father, and they in Him, and He in them.<a name=128:16></a> Chapter 15 shews us the relationship of the disciples with Him upon earth, taking the place of the Jews; the place of the disciples before the world, that of the Jews in rejecting Him, and then the Comforter.<a name=128:17></a> Chapter 16 tells us what the Holy Spirit would do when come; what His presence would be the proof of in the world, and what He would teach the disciples, putting them at the same time into immediate relationship with the Father.<a name=128:18></a> In chapter 17 the Lord, taking His stand upon the accomplishment of His work, and the revelation of the Father's name, places His own in His own position before the Father and before the world; the world is judged, in that it has rejected the Lord, and His own are left here in His place.<a name=128:19></a> In chapters 18 and 19 we have the history of the Lord's condemnation and crucifixion; in chapter 20, His resurrection and manifestation of Himself to His disciples, as well as their mission.<a name=128:20></a> Chapter 21 gives us His interview with His own in Galilee, Peter's restoration, and the prophecy of Jesus as to the latter, and as to John.<a name=128:21></a>

		After this short sketch of the Gospel as a whole, we will enter now upon the detail of the chapters.<a name=129:1></a>

	<div class="heading">
		CHAPTER 1
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first chapter presents to us the Person of the Lord in all its positive aspects -- what He is in Himself.<a name=129:2></a> Not in His relative characters; He is not here the Christ, nor Head of the church, nor High Priest -- that is to say, what He was, or what He is, in relationship with men down here, whether Jews or Christians.<a name=129:3></a> But it is Christ personally who is presented to us as well as His work.<a name=129:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The chapter begins with the divine and eternal existence of the Person of Jesus, the Son of God, with that which He is in the essence of His nature, so to speak.<a name=129:5></a> Genesis begins with the creation, and the Old Testament gives us the history of responsible man upon the earth, the sphere of that responsibility; John begins with that which preceded creation; he begins all anew here, in the Person of Him who became the second Man, the last Adam.<a name=129:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not, "In the beginning God <i>created</i>"; but, "In the beginning <i>was</i> the Word.<a name=130:1></a>" All is founded upon the uncreated existence of Him who created everything: at the beginning of all things He was there, without any beginning.<a name=130:2></a> "In the beginning was the Word," is the formal expression that the Word had no beginning.<a name=130:3></a> But there is more in this remarkable passage: the Word was personally distinct, "the Word was with God"; but He was not distinct in nature, "the Word was God.<a name=130:4></a>" Thus we have the eternal existence, the distinct personality, the identity of nature, of the Word; and all this existed in eternity.<a name=130:5></a> The distinct personality of the Word was not, as people have wished to make it, a thing which had a beginning.<a name=130:6></a> "In the beginning the Word was with God," verse 2.<a name=130:7></a> His personality is eternal as His nature.<a name=130:8></a> This is the great and glorious basis of the doctrine of the gospel and of our eternal joy, what the Saviour is in Himself, His nature, and His Person.<a name=130:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now comes what He is in His attributes, being such.<a name=130:10></a> First of all, He has created all things, and here we come to the beginning of Genesis.<a name=130:11></a> We have to do with Him in that which He is; the world is but that which He has made.<a name=130:12></a> All things were made by Him, and there is nothing created of which He was not the Creator.<a name=130:13></a> All that subsists, subsists by Him.<a name=130:14></a> He <i>was (een)</i>; all that began to exist <i>(egeneto)</i> began "by him.<a name=130:15></a>" He was the Creator of all beings.<a name=130:16></a> (Compare Hebrews 1: 2, 10.<a name=130:17></a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second quality found in Him is, that "in him was life," verse 4.<a name=130:18></a> This cannot be said of any creature; many have life, but they have it not in themselves.<a name=130:19></a> Christ becomes our life, but it is He who is it in us.<a name=130:20></a> "God hath given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son; he that hath the Son, hath life, and he that hath not the Son of God, hath not life.<a name=130:21></a>" This is a very momentous truth, as regards Himself, as regards us, and as regards the life that we possess as Christians.<a name=130:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But more; this life is "the light of men," a word of immense value for us.<a name=130:23></a> God Himself is light, and it is the divine light as life which expresses itself to men in the Word.<a name=130:24></a> It is not the light of angels, though God be light for all, for He is it in Himself, but, as it is relative, adapted to other beings, it is not to angels; His delights were in the sons of men; Proverbs 8.<a name=130:25></a> The proposition is one which is called reciprocal; that is, the two parts of the proposition have an equal value.<a name=130:26></a> I could say just as well, the light of men is the life which is in the Word.<a name=130:27></a> It is the perfect expression of the nature, counsels, and glory of God when all shall be consummated.<a name=130:28></a> It is in man that God will make Himself to be seen and known.<a name=130:29></a> "God was manifest in flesh .<a name=130:30></a>.<a name=130:31></a>.<a name=130:32></a> seen of angels.<a name=130:33></a>" The angels are the highest expression of God's power in creation; but it is in man that God has shewn Himself, and that, morally, in holiness and love.<a name=130:34></a> We ought to walk as Christ walked, to be imitators of God as His dear children, and walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given Himself for us; and also, "we are light in the Lord," for He is our life.<a name=130:35></a> If we know love, it is in that He laid down His life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.<a name=130:36></a> If God chastises us, it is to make us participators of His holiness.<a name=130:37></a> We walk in the light, as He is in the light.<a name=130:38></a> He has chosen us in Christ, to be "holy and irreproachable before him in love," which is the character of God Himself, a character perfectly realised in Christ.<a name=130:39></a> We purify ourselves, even as He is pure, knowing that we shall be like Him -- being transformed into the same image, from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord -- being renewed in knowledge after the image of Him who hath created us.<a name=130:40></a> And this is not a rule, although there be in it a rule (for we ought to walk as He walked), but a life which is the perfect expression of it, the expression of the life of God in man.<a name=130:41></a> Ineffable privilege!<a name=130:42></a> Wonderful nearness to Jesus!<a name=130:43></a> "Both he who sanctifieth, and they that are sanctified, are all of one.<a name=130:44></a>"

		Redemption develops and manifests all the moral qualities of God Himself, and above His qualities, His nature -- love and light, and that in man, and in connection with men.<a name=131:1></a> We are, as being in Christ, and Christ in us, the fruit and expression of all that God is in the fulness and revelation of Himself.<a name=131:2></a> He will shew, in the ages to come, the exceeding riches of His grace, in His kindness towards us in Christ Jesus.<a name=131:3></a> But then, in order that all this should be brought out, love and even light, an occasion must present itself; and that, not in an object amiable and intelligent in good (for then man could love), but there, where all the opposite of this nature shewed itself; it was necessary also that good should be proved superior to evil, in letting evil have its free course.<a name=131:4></a> "The light shone in the darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not.<a name=131:5></a>" Not only was man not light, not only was he darkness, without any glimmering of the nature of God, but there was no power in him of receiving this light; there was opposition of nature.<a name=131:6></a> They saw no beauty in Him to desire Him.<a name=131:7></a> In that which was nothing else than the exhibition of the divine nature in itself, it was impossible to go further.<a name=131:8></a> In natural things, if there is light, there is no more darkness; but in the moral world it is not so; the light, that which is pure in itself, and manifests everything, is there, and it is not perceived who is there.<a name=131:9></a> "Is not this the carpenter's son?<a name=131:10></a>" "If thou knewest who it is that saith unto thee, Give me to drink.<a name=131:11></a>" "If this man were a prophet" -- it is a definite judgment, pronouncing Him not to be a prophet, when God is there, and shews Himself as such.<a name=131:12></a> For since that which God is in this world reveals that which is above, the mind that reigns there does not associate itself with a single principle which governs the heart and the habits of men.<a name=131:13></a> There is in that heart no knowledge of sin, no knowledge of God, no knowledge of the state into which sin has plunged us; sin itself is estimated according to the evil which it has done to ourselves, not according to its opposition to God's nature, although I admit that a conscience has been acquired by the fall; egotism has become the starting-point for everything.<a name=131:14></a> Then, when the light comes, which, on the contrary, shews what sin is, where this has placed man morally before God, everything is judged of according to egotism as a starting-point; and the manifestation of God finds no entry into the heart.<a name=131:15></a> This is an unknown field for man: it is the truth, and man is in a state of falsehood, as he is without God, and he understands nothing here.<a name=131:16></a> God is light; and when He is manifested such as He is, but adapted to man, man's state is such that nothing responds to this manifestation.<a name=131:17></a> If the conscience, which is from God, is reached, the hatred of the will is awakened.<a name=131:18></a> (See the end of Acts 7 and John 3: 19.<a name=131:19></a>)

		We have, then, in an abstract way, in these first five verses that which the Lord is, divinely, in Himself; and together with this, at the end, the effect of His manifestation in the midst of men, such as they were, still in an abstract way.<a name=132:1></a> Thus it is as light that He is here presented; it is not love which is revealed.<a name=132:2></a> Come down here as love, He has been active, both towards the world, and efficaciously towards His own, which implies the cross, that is to say, the light rejected.<a name=132:3></a> But here it is what the Lord is which is presented to us, not that which He does in divine activity.<a name=132:4></a> Verses 16-19 of chapter 3 give us the summary of what He is in these two particulars.<a name=132:5></a> God is love; but Christ was the activity of this love, according to the nature and settled purpose of God.<a name=132:6></a> (Compare verse 17 of the chapter we are examining.<a name=132:7></a>) The law demanded of man that which man ought to be; in Christ something "is come" from God -- light and love; but this subject will occupy us more fully in a moment.<a name=132:8></a> I only repeat, that what is given us, up to the present, is what the Lord is in Himself, but in the character which puts man to the test, which shews what man is; and the passage terminates with the effect of the manifestation of what He is, without His being named.<a name=132:9></a> This Light can manifest itself there, where there is nothing that answers to it: it is not comprehended.<a name=132:10></a> It is moral incapacity, not hatred; the latter is opposed to love.<a name=132:11></a>

		We may remark, that, in being made partakers of the divine nature, we become light; Ephesians 5: 8.<a name=133:1></a> It is never said that we are love.<a name=133:2></a> God is sovereign in His love; without doubt it is His nature, in communion, and in goodness, and in mercy, but free.<a name=133:3></a> We are made partakers of this nature, and we walk in love, as the love has been manifested in Jesus, because He is our life; but it is in obedience that we walk thus, it is a duty, a joyful duty -- easy, if we walk with joy, and stronger than the evil, but not free, having its source in ourselves.<a name=133:4></a> We cannot say that we are supreme love, a source from which love springs; but the new man is holy in himself; it is that which he is, although this be, in our case, in relation with an object.<a name=133:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the sixth and following verses we begin the history: Christ should appear.<a name=133:6></a> It is not now what He is abstractedly; now we find a forerunner -- John the Baptist.<a name=133:7></a> God, in His goodness, was not satisfied with giving the light: He announces it -- by another, so as to draw men's attention.<a name=133:8></a> John the Baptist bears; witness to the Light, but here it is that all may believe, and not for Israel only: John the Baptist was not the Light, but he came to bear witness to Him who was.<a name=133:9></a> Now the true Light is He who, coming into the world, is light for every man, Pharisee or sinner, Jew or Gentile.<a name=133:10></a> He is the Light, who, come from on high, is such for every one, whether He be rejected or received: for a Simon or a Herod, for Nathanael or for Caiaphas.<a name=133:11></a> He is the expression of God, and of the mind of God for every man, whatever state he may be in.<a name=133:12></a> The subject here is not that of receiving the light into the heart.<a name=133:13></a> In that case it is a question of the state of him who receives; here, of the fact of the appearing of the Light in this world.<a name=133:14></a> It was in the world in the Person of the Saviour; the world was made by Him; but when He was in the world, the world did not know Him; He came to His own, the Jews, He who was their Jehovah and their Messiah, and His own received Him not (verse 9 -- 11).<a name=133:15></a>

		This is the result of the manifestation of the Light in the midst of men, historically -- incapacity to understand it, and rejection when it was directly addressed to those who had already been in relation to it by promises and prophecies, and who had received the law from it, the rule of human life -- though always remaining Light.<a name=134:1></a> Some, however, received it; and to those He gave the right to take the place of children of God, not that there were some of a better quality, or of a will less perverse than the others; no, they were born again, born of God; "born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.<a name=134:2></a>" The exterior revelation of the light in the Word was accompanied by a quickening power of God, which gave it a vital reality in the soul, in forming the incorruptible seed of God.<a name=134:3></a> As life, Christ was there.<a name=134:4></a> The man was born of God.<a name=134:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This terminates the exposition of the Word as light in itself, and as revealed in the world and in the midst of His own; presented abstractedly in verses 1-5, and in verses 7-13 historically, but still in its nature as light, and not as a man; then, after all, if it were received, in what the difference consisted.<a name=134:6></a>

		At verse 14, historical Christianity begins.<a name=134:7></a> Up to that, it is what Christ <i>was</i>, as well as what was the state of the sphere in which He was manifested.<a name=134:8></a> Now we have that which He became -- "The Word became flesh.<a name=134:9></a>" It was not an appearance, as in the Old Testament, but He took a tabernacle to dwell amongst us, even though it were but for a time.<a name=134:10></a> It was a Man in the midst of men (He will keep the tabernacle for ever); but He has lived down here full of grace and truth, love and light, adapted to the state of man down here; then we, believers, have received of His fulness and grace upon grace; in short, as the only begotten Son in the bosom of the Father, He has revealed the Father.<a name=134:11></a> The Word made flesh has been among us, revealing the glory of an only-begotten Son with His Father, full of grace and truth: we have all received of His fulness: then He has revealed the Father.<a name=134:12></a> He was the Son in manifestation, Man in the midst of men, the Word, which was God, made flesh.<a name=134:13></a> In Him grace and truth came into the world; He is a full source of grace for us, from which we have all received abundance of grace, and He has also revealed the Father.<a name=134:14></a><a href="#134:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> This is the second part of our chapter, the history of the Person of the Christ.<a name=134:15></a> To this also John bears witness: he was not the Christ, but His forerunner, the voice that cries in the wilderness, and who, in calling to repentance, prepares the way of the Lord.<a name=134:16></a>

		This introduces a third point.<a name=135:1></a> Whilst announcing His Person, he who presents Him hides himself; he is neither the Christ, nor the prophet promised by Moses, nor Elias, promised by Malachi, but only according to Isaiah's word, the voice to announce another, whom the Pharisees did not know, He who was coming after him, but who was preferred before him, the latchet of whose shoe he was not worthy to unloose.<a name=135:2></a> This is turned into personal testimony when Jesus appears before John the next day.<a name=135:3></a> (Verse 29, and following.<a name=135:4></a>) John designates Him here, not as the Messiah, but in connection with His work, of which there are two parts: He takes away sin, and He baptises with the Holy Ghost.<a name=135:5></a>

		Jesus is "the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world.<a name=135:6></a>" Sin must be taken away from before God.<a name=135:7></a> The time will come when there will be no more sin before the eyes of God, nor before ours, a time of eternal repose for God and for our hearts.<a name=135:8></a> What a true rest, and how blessed for the heart!<a name=135:9></a> There has been a paradise of innocence, which depended upon the creature's faithfulness, a state of innocence uncertain, and at once lost: there has been a world of sin, where nevertheless God has been acting in grace: there will be a world of new heavens and a new earth, where righteousness will dwell, a state of things which cannot be shaken, morally immutable, for the value of Christ's work remains always the same.<a name=135:10></a> This will not be a state of innocence where all depended upon obedience put to the test, and in which man failed, but a happiness where obedience was perfectly tested, and accomplished.<a name=135:11></a> Righteousness ensures the stability of this state of things, for God cannot slight the perfection of the work of Christ, for His glory.<a name=135:12></a> Also there will be nothing there but holiness.<a name=135:13></a> All there will glorify God in all that He is; nothing will be contrary to His nature.<a name=135:14></a> Sin will be taken away from before God in the new heavens and the new earth.<a name=135:15></a> Jesus is the One who takes it away: the work is done, the result is not yet produced.<a name=135:16></a> The passage does not say, "The Lamb of God <i>who hath taken away</i>," nor, "who <i>will take away</i>" -- it presents the character of Him who was there before the eyes of John the Baptist, He who was doing the thing.<a name=135:17></a> The passage does not treat of the guilt in which we are (a most important subject in its place), that is evident, but of a state of things before God.<a name=135:18></a> John takes things habitually thus in their great principles.<a name=135:19></a> It is God who has appeared, and all is judged according to the light of His presence.<a name=135:20></a> His holiness demands -- yea, His majesty, inasmuch as He is holy -- that sin be taken away from before His eyes.<a name=135:21></a> He who accomplished the work, who was doing it, was now there.<a name=135:22></a> present upon the earth.<a name=135:23></a> He was "the Lamb of God," the Lamb who suited perfectly the glory of God, the Lamb that God alone could have provided for Himself, who was able to establish His glory, His highest glory, there where sin was found; the Lamb who could give Himself freely for this glory, and to accomplish thus a work which should be the moral foundation (its value being immutable, and subsisting without the possibility of change, for the work was always itself) of an eternal blessing, according to God, and before Him.<a name=135:24></a>

		The Saviour was to do yet another thing; that is, to baptise with the Holy Ghost.<a name=137:1></a> This is introduced by one of the most interesting and touching facts: Jesus receives the Holy Ghost as Man, and the scripture employs the same words as to Him as when it speaks of us: "Jesus of Nazareth .<a name=137:2></a>.<a name=137:3></a>.<a name=137:4></a> whom God anointed with the Holy Spirit, and with power"; and the Lord Himself said, "Him hath God the Father sealed.<a name=137:5></a>" Jesus has been sealed as Son, Man down here, in virtue of His own perfection, and His own relationship with the Father as Son; <i>we</i> are sealed, being sons by faith in Him (Galatians 3: 26; chapter 4: 6), in virtue of the redemption that He has accomplished.<a name=137:6></a> We, consequently, could not be sealed before He had taken His place as Man on high -- witnesses at the same time of the efficacy of redemption, and of that which redemption has acquired for us.<a name=137:7></a> "Except a grain of wheat fall into the ground, and die, it remaineth alone; but if it die, it beareth much fruit.<a name=137:8></a>" Thus we read (John 7: 39), "The Spirit was not yet [that is, not yet on earth in believers], because Jesus was not yet glorified.<a name=137:9></a>" It was the witness that He was the Son personally.<a name=137:10></a> Now that redemption is accomplished, and that Jesus is glorified, after its accomplishment, the Holy Ghost is given to us who believe in Jesus.<a name=137:11></a>

		Thus also, although the result of the sacrifice of Christ, taking away the sin of the world, be not yet brought out, we know that that which forms the basis of this blessed result is accomplished, and we enjoy its efficacy in the perfect purification of our conscience, and in the glorious hope of being with Christ, like Him in heaven, the Holy Ghost assuring us of one of these things, in being the earnest of the other.<a name=137:12></a> Christ baptises (or rather now we say has baptised) His own with the Holy Ghost, giving us the consciousness of being sons in full liberty before the Father, who hath sealed Him as being personally the Son of God, perfect in everything.<a name=137:13></a> It was this sign given to John the Baptist, that opened his mouth to bear witness that Jesus was the Son of God.<a name=137:14></a> John saw clearly that Jesus was a glorious Person, whose shoe-latchet he was not worthy to unloose, and he felt that it was not his place to baptise this Person.<a name=137:15></a> But the descent of the Spirit upon Jesus is the clear, heavenly testimony, shewing who Jesus was, as to His Person, as Son of God: John saw and bore witness that He was the Son of God Himself in this world.<a name=137:16></a> It is very precious for us (although in our case it is no question of our persons, but of sovereign grace) to think that, if ascended into glory He has baptised us with the Holy Ghost (the witness that we are sons and giving us the consciousness of it), He the eternal Son received Himself first of all as Man down here this same testimony.<a name=137:17></a> the seal and unction of the Spirit, which enables us to cry, "Abba, Father!<a name=137:18></a>" It is the foretaste of that truth, that He which sanctifieth, and they who are sanctified, are all of one; Hebrews 2: 11.<a name=137:19></a>

		But if down here, a divine testimony has been given that Jesus was the Son of God, His title as Lamb of God is that which characterises Him.<a name=138:1></a> John the Baptist's heart recognised Him already as such, for the witness he bears here is not a testimony borne in his preaching.<a name=138:2></a> He saw Jesus walking before him, and his heart, full of the deep truth, exclaims, "Behold the Lamb of God!<a name=138:3></a>" He had already announced Him in that character, and no one had followed Jesus; but now that which came from his heart in grace attracted hearts; two of John's disciples hear him, and follow the Lord.<a name=138:4></a> Thus Jesus begins to gather His disciples.<a name=138:5></a> He accepts the position of the centre of gathering.<a name=138:6></a> The two disciples had received the word of God from the mouth of John the Baptist; but neither John, nor any one of the prophets, had ever taken the place of being a centre, around which those who received God's word assembled; now there was One in the world around whom they could thus gather; it was "the Lamb of God.<a name=138:7></a>" Jesus, seeing the two disciples following Him, said to them, "Whom seek ye?<a name=138:8></a>" They said to Him, "Rabbi, where dwellest thou?<a name=138:9></a>" He answered, "Come and see.<a name=138:10></a>"

		This is an important principle and fact; there was not only upon earth a testimony but a Person who was a gathering-point for those who received God's word, and this from God Himself.<a name=139:1></a> This was the fruit of John the Baptist's testimony.<a name=139:2></a> Andrew, one of John's two disciples, finds Simon, his own brother, and announces to him that they had found, not the Lamb of God, but the Christ.<a name=139:3></a> The testimony which we receive, always attaches itself to that which is already in the heart; it does not go beyond that which adapts itself to what is there.<a name=139:4></a> If all God's love in Christ is preached, if work is done in the soul, this will produce a conviction of sin, perhaps even to make us nearly despair of salvation.<a name=139:5></a> "The Lamb of God" goes infinitely further than "the Messiah"; but these sincere souls that we see here, and who had received the word of God in their heart, had found "the Messiah," verse 42.<a name=139:6></a> Andrew brings Simon to Jesus, who calls him Cephas, otherwise Peter.<a name=139:7></a> The right of giving names is the expression of sovereignty, as we constantly find in the word; only Christ gives the names with a divine knowledge of the persons.<a name=139:8></a> He appropriated to Himself supreme authority, but with the competency of a divine Person.<a name=139:9></a> Never would John the Baptist have given names to his disciples in this way.<a name=139:10></a>

		But although Jesus was the centre that gathered those who received the testimony of God, He was come to bear witness to the truth, and in carrying out this work He had nowhere to lay His head.<a name=139:11></a> He begins this active service in verse 43: He would go into Galilee, where His testimony was to be borne amongst the poor of the flock, and He finds Philip Himself.<a name=139:12></a> This is the second character of testimony.<a name=139:13></a> The first was John, and that which followed; here it is Christ, and it is a question of following Him, Him who was a pilgrim and stranger in this world.<a name=139:14></a> Christ thus appears also in another character; up to this time we have seen Him as centre, He received believers, and surrounded Himself with them there, where He dwelt; here they must follow Him, where He was a pilgrim -- a second testimony of all-importance.<a name=139:15></a>

		As the object of John the Baptist's testimony, Jesus was the centre, and He is always; but, in fact in His own testimony down here, He was a stranger, and had nowhere to lay His head; He began at the manger, and ended at the cross.<a name=139:16></a> All His life was the life of One who was a stranger down here, who walked in the world to bear witness in it to God in grace, but in following a path which no vulture's eye hath seen.<a name=139:17></a> The two characters of testimony bring out into bold relief, the state of the world, on the one hand; and on the other, that which Jesus was doing there.<a name=139:18></a> Why have in this world a centre of gathering, on the part of God, if it be not that the world, and even God's people according to the flesh, had entirely got away from God, and that it needed some one to draw souls out of this state by the revelation of God in the midst of this world?<a name=139:19></a> And now, again, the principle is the same, only the blessed Centre is in heaven: He gave Himself for our sins, to take us out of this present evil age.<a name=139:20></a> Then, why follow Jesus, to be a pilgrim as Jesus always was down here?<a name=139:21></a> Adam was not a pilgrim in paradise; we shall not be pilgrims in heaven: there was no need of a road in the one, and we shall find none in the other, as if we wished to get out of it.<a name=139:22></a> It was the sabbath of God below; it is the eternal rest of God on high; one will not go out of it; there was no need, and there will be no need, in the one, or in the other, of a path where some one is to be followed.<a name=139:23></a> Here it is not so; neither the rest of God, nor the rest of man, is to be found upon the earth, and what we want is a path across the desert.<a name=139:24></a> There is only one which is sure, and One alone could trace it; and faith alone discerns it; it is Jesus who says, "Follow me.<a name=139:25></a>" We need a path, and the path is found.<a name=139:26></a> Philip also was of Galilee.<a name=139:27></a> God's work was not built upon Jerusalem, the old centre according to the flesh; but the basis, the path, and the centre, is the Son of God, the revelation of God Himself in the world, Himself the First of all, the despised and rejected of men, but the image of the invisible God.<a name=139:28></a>

		CHAPTER 3
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nicodemus comes to Jesus with the declaration of the same principle which had produced the conviction of those in whom Jesus had no confidence -- the miracles were to him a demonstration that Jesus was a teacher sent from God.<a name=143:1></a> I even think that the others went further than Nicodemus; it is said they believed in His name (chapter 2: 23).<a name=143:2></a> As to Nicodemus, he was convinced that Christ's teaching must have God for its source, thus he was disposed to listen.<a name=143:3></a> The belief of the former did not produce any need in their souls; in this case conviction may go as far as you like, without the soul's being troubled, or any effect whatever being produced: it costs nothing -- we often see this.<a name=143:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in Nicodemus's case there was more, and it was a proof of the action of God; there was with him a need.<a name=143:5></a> The Holy Spirit of God always acts thus, even in the Christian.<a name=143:6></a> This feeling of need which He begets produces activity in the soul; this is what had happened to Nicodemus.<a name=143:7></a> More, when the Spirit of God acts in a soul, the word of God asserts its authority over it, and creates the desire to hear that word; this never fails.<a name=143:8></a> There are so many unsatisfied desires in the soul, that when it is awakened, the need to know what God has said is produced in it.<a name=143:9></a> The soul has the consciousness of having to do with Him, and the need of knowing what He has said becomes the spring of its activity, and characterises it.<a name=143:10></a> It is not the reception of a system of doctrine, or of dogmas about a divine Person; it is the soul that hungers and thirst for what God has said; ignorant of everything but its need, it wishes to receive.<a name=143:11></a> It is a good thing for the soul to trust in God's word, in the source of truth (this is already implicit faith), without the truth being, as yet, communicated in fact; for it listens with confidence.<a name=143:12></a> Nicodemus was in this state; the Samaritan woman also, but, in her case the conscience was more in question; so also with the twelve; when several of His disciples abandoned Jesus, they would not leave Him, for He had the words of eternal life.<a name=143:13></a> When God acts, the link between God and the conscience and soul is not broken; I am not speaking of union, but of a moral work in the heart.<a name=143:14></a> But notice, as soon as ever the need is produced in Nicodemus's heart, he feels instinctively that the world, and the religious authorities -- the worst part of the world -- will be against him.<a name=143:15></a> There is fear; Nicodemus comes to Jesus by night.<a name=143:16></a> Poor human nature!<a name=143:17></a> If a soul puts itself in relationship with God, in recognising His word, the world will not stand it.<a name=143:18></a> We know this.<a name=143:19></a> But Nicodemus's faith did not go farther than to recognise the authority of the Saviour's word as a word which came from God, grace having produced in his heart the need of these communications from God.<a name=143:20></a>

		It is a great thing to have a real need, feeble though it be morally; for here, in Nicodemus's case, there was little need in the conscience, and no knowledge of himself.<a name=144:1></a> He was cleaving to religious hopes, to doctrines, and a revelation given from God; he was seeking instruction from Jesus, but he had his part in the general conviction that the miracles of Jesus produced -- a conviction strengthened by uprightness, and by personal need; Jesus was a teacher sent from God.<a name=144:2></a> But Jesus stops Nicodemus short; the resurrection and kingdom were not come, but in order to receive the revelation which had been given of it, there must be a divine operation, a new nature; it was necessary to partake of an entirely new life.<a name=144:3></a> The kingdom was not coming in a way to attract attention, but the King, with all the perfection that belonged to Him, was there present, and consequently the kingdom itself, presented in His Person; only this kingdom, not being revealed in power, the rejection of the King caused by the very perfection of His Person, as well as the work accomplished in His rejection, introduced a heavenly inheritance.<a name=144:4></a> Further this work, and this rejection, brought those who should be identified with a rejected Christ into those courts above where God displayed His glory, and this is far higher than the glory of the Messiah, if it had been then accomplished.<a name=144:5></a> It was already the dawn of the accomplishment of the counsels of God not yet revealed.<a name=144:6></a>

		Two things are presented to us in the first half of the chapter before us: first of all, the kingdom, and what is needed to have part in it, and, in measure, the earthly things, and what is necessary to enjoy them with God, but also the kingdom, as it was then presented in its moral character.<a name=145:1></a> Then, secondly, heaven, eternal life, that which is essential to our most real and intimate relationship with God, namely, the possession of eternal life before Him, in contrast with the thought of perishing.<a name=145:2></a> Here it is no question of the kingdom, it is eternal life, such as Jesus, come from heaven, could reveal it to us.<a name=145:3></a> But this supposes the cross: it is no question of Messiah, but of the Son of man, and of the love which God has had for the world, not of His intentions with regard to the kingdom, and the promises connected with this kingdom, but of plans far more vast and exalted, heavenly in their character, in which God reveals what He is; and Jesus, rejected as Messiah, dies, and enters into glory as the Son of man who has suffered.<a name=145:4></a> No doubt this new birth is in any case necessary, subjectively, even that we may see the kingdom, and enjoy it, much more, that we may enjoy heavenly things in the presence of God.<a name=145:5></a> But as the passage speaks of the new birth, it does not treat of the heavenly glory; for this the cross must be brought in also.<a name=145:6></a> However it is Well to remark that this whole passage, in its two parts, supposes the new order of things, where grace was acting, and that not limited to the Jews.<a name=145:7></a> It was an entirely new thing that was being brought in; the kingdom was not established in glory, but founded and received in the Person of the King, demanding a new nature to see it, and extending itself to every one whom grace could reach.<a name=145:8></a> It was morally and subjectively, the new thing; only in the first part, we have neither heavenly things, nor eternal life; in the second, we have not the kingdom.<a name=145:9></a>

		The first thing the Lord does in stopping Nicodemus short -- who only spoke of being instructed in the state in which he was, he, a child of the kingdom according to the flesh -- is to tell him that it was not a question of that, but that he must be born entirely anew.<a name=145:10></a> We will look into the details in a moment; it is, however, important, first of all, to seize, that the Lord speaks of the two characters of blessing, that is, of the heavenly glory, and of the kingdom according to promise, but that He speaks of them according to the aspects they presented at that very time.<a name=145:11></a> We may say that He presents them, with regard to His Person in their spiritual character; on the one hand, the King despised, and that which was heavenly meeting with the cross in His Person; but, on the other hand, the new birth and life-giving power, the Son of man, the love of God, and consequently what concerned the world and man, not only dispensations and the Jews.<a name=145:12></a> For, faithful though God be to His promises, He cannot, when He reveals Himself, confine Himself to the Jews.<a name=145:13></a>

		First of all then, the kingdom was being revealed in a way which did not attract attention, not by a power that should rule over the world, nor by its outward glory; a new nature was needed to perceive it.<a name=146:1></a> The King was there, and He gave proofs of a divine mission and of the presence of Him who was to come, but in humiliation; to the natural eye He was the carpenter's son.<a name=146:2></a> Nicodemus reasoned well in saying, in verse <i>2</i>, "We know .<a name=146:3></a>.<a name=146:4></a>.<a name=146:5></a> for no one can do the miracles which thou doest, <i>unless God be with him</i>"; but God had His, "Except a man be born again" -- born entirely anew.<a name=146:6></a> This life is a beginning again of life, of a new source, and of a new nature -- a life that came from God.<a name=146:7></a> But Nicodemus still remained within the bounds and limits of the flesh, of the natural man.<a name=146:8></a> They are the limits of what man is, of his intelligence.<a name=146:9></a> Man cannot be more than he is; he cannot get beyond his nature.<a name=146:10></a> But the class of infidels who boast of having made this immense discovery, shew, on the one hand, the limit of the human understanding, so that they can discern nothing beyond what man is; and, on the other hand, the absence of solid reasoning in themselves; for, from what they have discovered, there is no proof that a more powerful Being cannot introduce something new.<a name=146:11></a> Their wisdom is a self-evident fact; man by himself cannot see beyond that which is in himself; their conclusion is absolutely without force.<a name=146:12></a> By their principle they can conclude nothing beyond the limits of humanity; but the limits of active power are not necessarily those of receptivity.<a name=146:13></a> Let us return to our chapter, and seek to listen to and understand the Saviour's words better than Nicodemus.<a name=146:14></a>

		Nicodemus, as we have said, confines himself to the experience of what happens in man; Christ revealed that which was being accomplished on God's part -- the key of all the Lord's history.<a name=147:1></a> He had spoken of that which was necessary to see, to discern the kingdom: one must be born of water and of the Spirit.<a name=147:2></a> It is the kingdom of God, in whatever state it may be, and one must be made meet for this kingdom, must have a nature fit to take part in it.<a name=147:3></a> Two things are found here, water and the Spirit -- a nature thus characterised, morally and in its source.<a name=147:4></a> Water as a figure, is always the word applied by the Spirit; it brings the thoughts of God heavenly, divine, but adapted to man; it judges what is found in him, but it brings in these divine thoughts, and so purifies the heart.<a name=147:5></a> For water purifies what exists; but also it is the new man who drinks it, and this is not separated from that which is entirely new.<a name=147:6></a> "That which is born of the Spirit, is spirit," partakes of the nature of that of which it is born; this is, in truth, the new nature.<a name=147:7></a> The practical purification of our thoughts and hearts, of which we have spoken, is indeed the effect of that which this nature receives, of things for which the flesh has no desire.<a name=147:8></a> We could not say, "That which is born of water, is water.<a name=147:9></a>" Water purifies that which exists; but we receive a new life, which is really Christ Himself in power of life in us, that which Adam innocent had not.<a name=147:10></a> We partake of the divine nature, as Peter expresses it; and where this expression is found, in the Second Epistle of Peter, it is connected with birth by water; we escape the corruption that is in the world by lust.<a name=147:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is thus only that we enter the kingdom.<a name=147:12></a> The kingdom of God is more than a paradise for man, it is what is fitting for God, and it is necessary that we should have a nature that answers to it.<a name=147:13></a> Adam, in his state of innocence, had not this, his level was man, as God had created him.<a name=147:14></a> For the kingdom of God, he who finds himself there, must have that which -- in man however -- is suitable to God Himself.<a name=147:15></a> Notice, that the Lord goes outside all questions of dispensations, He has in view the moral nature, that which is born of the flesh, is flesh, has that nature; that which is born of the Spirit is spirit, that is to say, corresponds to the divine nature, which is its source.<a name=147:16></a> But then it could not be a question only of the Jews; if any one had this nature, he was fit for the kingdom.<a name=147:17></a> It was not a question of a people already chosen of God, but of a nature suitable to God.<a name=147:18></a>

		Two things are brought to light when these principles have been laid down; first of all, the necessity of this new birth, in order to enjoy the promises made to the Jews for the earth; and secondly, that this work was of God, who communicated this new nature.<a name=148:1></a> God could communicate it by His Spirit to whom He would, and this opened the door to the Gentiles.<a name=148:2></a> Nicodemus, Jesus told him, ought not to have been astonished at the Saviour saying that the Jews must be born again; the prophets had announced this (see Ezekiel 36: 24-28), and Nicodemus, as a master or teacher in Israel, ought to have known it.<a name=148:3></a> The wind, too, blew where it listed (verse 8); so was the operation of the Spirit.<a name=148:4></a> It was a work of God, and thus could be accomplished in any one.<a name=148:5></a>

		There were still the heavenly things.<a name=148:6></a> Now if Nicodemus did not understand these earthly things of Israel's blessing, how would he understand if the Lord spoke to him of heavenly things?<a name=148:7></a> Now no one had ascended to heaven, so as to be able to bring word of what was there, and of what was necessary to be able to enjoy it, save He who had descended thence, who spoke of what He knew, and bore witness to what He had seen; not the Messiah -- that had to do with the earth -- but the Son of man, who, as to His divine nature, was in heaven.<a name=148:8></a>

		Thus we have a revelation of heavenly things brought directly from heaven by Christ, and in His Person.<a name=148:9></a> He revealed them in all their freshness, a freshness which was found in Him, and which He, who was ever in heaven, enjoyed; He revealed them in the perfection of the Person of Him, who made the glory of heaven, whose nature is the atmosphere which all those who are found there breathe, and by which they live; He, the object of the affections which animate this holy place from the Father Himself down to the last of the angels who fill heaven's courts with their praises, He the centre of all the glory.<a name=148:10></a> Such is the Son of man, He who came down to reveal the Father -- truth and grace -- but who divinely remained in heaven in the essence of His divine nature, in His Person inseparable from the humanity with which He was clothed!<a name=148:11></a> The deity which filled this humanity was inseparable in His Person from all the divine perfection, but He never ceased to be man, really and truly man before God.<a name=148:12></a>

		But we have another truth here: the Son of man was to re-enter heaven as Man, to be Head over all things.<a name=149:1></a> As Son of God He has been appointed Heir (Hebrews 1); He is such as Creator (Colossians 1), but also as Man and Son of man, according to God's counsels.<a name=149:2></a> (Psalm 8, quoted in Ephesians 1, in 1 Corinthians 15, in Hebrews 2 -- passages which develop clearly His place in this respect.<a name=149:3></a>) Proverbs 8 teaches us that He who was Jehovah's delight before the foundation of the world, rejoiced then in the habitable parts of the earth, and His delights were in the sons of men.<a name=149:4></a> The angels (Luke 2) recall this truth, or rather the proofs which His incarnation gave of the thoughts of God in this respect; they speak of this incarnation as the manifestation of God's good pleasure in men.<a name=149:5></a> As then He has been the manifestation of God upon earth, He enters as Man into the glory of God on high.<a name=149:6></a> He will reign over the earth as Head of the creation, gathering together all things under His authority<a href="#149:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> (Colossians 1); but here we speak of heavenly things.<a name=149:7></a> The Son of man takes His place on high to be Head over all things (1 Peter 3: 22; John 13: 3; chapter 16: 15).<a name=149:8></a> Man, in His Person, has entered heaven, into the presence of God Himself, without a veil, and all things are to be subjected under His feet.<a name=149:9></a> But will they be so, such as they are, and men who are to be His joint-heirs, will they be so, such as they are in sin, enemies of God by their wicked works?<a name=149:10></a> It is impossible.<a name=149:11></a> Another fundamental thing is necessary, redemption.<a name=149:12></a> Man, with a thousand times more sin than that which caused him to be driven irrevocably from the earthly paradise -- man, who had gone so far as to have accumulated upon his head, the rejection of God, of grace, and of the Son of God -- could not, such as he was, enter the heavenly paradise: it was impossible.<a name=149:13></a> If, then, Christ should as Man possess the glory which in the counsels of God was the portion of man, and if He was to have joint-heirs, and introduce them into His Father's house, He must redeem them and purify them according to the glory of God.<a name=149:14></a> He must also redeem creation from the yoke under which sin had placed it, and from Satan's dominion.<a name=149:15></a> Here it is a question only of the state of the heirs, and of their deliverance from death and condemnation.<a name=149:16></a> Now, when the Son of man is presented to us, His sufferings and death are constantly introduced.<a name=149:17></a> As Messiah He was rejected upon earth by His people; but the only result of this was His passing into the wider sphere of Son of man, Head of the entire creation, and Head, in a special way, of those whom He is not ashamed to call His brethren.<a name=149:18></a> But for this, redemption was needed; we learn this in Matthew 16: 20, 21, and more definitely in Mark 8: 29-31, and Luke 9: 20-22, with the consequences which result from it for us.<a name=149:19></a> In John's Gospel too, before He leaves the world, the Father would have a testimony borne to the titles of glory of Jesus.<a name=149:20></a> As Son of God, He was glorified by the resurrection of Lazarus; as Son of David, by His entry into Jerusalem on the ass's colt; finally, the Greeks, who had come up to worship at Jerusalem, having sought the disciples in their desire to see Jesus, and the disciples having communicated this to Him, the Lord says, "The hour is come that the Son of man should be glorified.<a name=149:21></a> Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone; but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit," John 12: 23, 24.<a name=149:22></a>

		We have already remarked, and we recall the reader's attention to it, that in this chapter, the presentation whether it be of life, or of the work which procures it for us, is given in connection with its present and personal application; it is a presentation of what these two things are in their nature, not as to the extent of their result, but in their application to us as a means of having part whether in the kingdom, or in heavenly things.<a name=150:3></a> The lifting-up of the Son of man on the cross corresponds down here, both on the side of our need, and that of God, to the revelation of the heavenly things which the Son brought down -- to that which is found in heaven.<a name=150:4></a> It is a question of being before God when He is fully revealed, not only when the Messiah promised to the Jews had been rejected (so that the right to the accomplishment of the promises was lost for those who possessed this right, after that the law had been broken), but when man's hatred against God -- against a God revealed in goodness -- had been clearly manifested.<a name=150:5></a> It was no longer merely sins, and the violation of the law, it was the rejection of grace, when sins and the violation of the law were already there.<a name=150:6></a> Man would not have God at any price (see John 15: 22-24); how could he have part with Christ in God's presence, a part in heavenly glory?<a name=150:7></a> Still, the sin of man has not brought the grace of God to nought.<a name=150:8></a> But if, as Son of man, Christ had undertaken man's cause, He must undergo the consequences of this, since He had become responsible for it before God; Hebrews 2: 10.<a name=150:9></a> In order that we might have part in the heavenly things, it was necessary that the Son of man should be lifted up,<a href="#150:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> and that according to God's glory, in connection with that which had so much dishonoured Him; now it is, as made sin, Christ accomplished this, Himself also bearing our sins.<a name=150:10></a> Far from God, we must have perished in our sins; He came forward for us, receiving all, as Man, from the hand of His Father, and obeying Him ever; He took the form of a servant in a nature which He will never leave, and in this nature He has become, by right, according to the righteousness and according to the counsels of God, Lord of all things; He whom no one knows but the Father only, but who reveals the Father to us, He who came down close to us -- who has touched us, so to speak -- who took our nature, though He could say, "Before Abraham was, I am.<a name=150:11></a>" He of whom our tongues and intelligence can speak but imperfectly is the Creator of everything; but His place as Man is at the head of the creation.<a name=150:12></a> He it is who came to reveal heavenly things to us, and to shew their effect in His Person as Man, while living in the midst of heavenly things all the time; so that, being Man down here, He should reveal them in all their freshness, adapted at the same time to man, so that he should live by them, and enter in spirit with Him there, where that was which He revealed, and later on should enter there glorified and like Him.<a name=150:13></a>

		Let us see how John presents the difference of which I speak.<a name=156:5></a> He could not do it as possessing these things, for they were not yet; but his testimony as to the rights of the Person of Christ, goes a long way in this passage, where he is speaking to his disciples.<a name=156:6></a> His joy was to have seen the Bridegroom, and that in the character of a friend: this is the first difference.<a name=156:7></a> He to whom all belonged by right was there: He had the bride, perhaps here the earthly bride, I have already spoken of it, but He was the Bridegroom.<a name=156:8></a> John's joy was to see Him.<a name=156:9></a> It was a great thing even to compare himself to Him who was come from heaven, although he accepted the disappearing of his own importance with unfeigned piety and joy, because He who eclipsed the brightness of John's testimony, by the presence of the object itself of that testimony was there.<a name=156:10></a> John's piety shines out in its clearest light as he thus goes into the shade, in order to exalt the One who, although unknown, was the true divine light, and who made His forerunner disappear by His divine brightness.<a name=156:11></a> Truth in the inner man manifested itself by the effect which the truth he announced should produce; his soul was at the height of the testimony he bore.<a name=156:12></a> This is much to say of a man; but this was the fair fruit of grace in this honoured witness of the Saviour.<a name=156:13></a>

		The divine, heavenly Person of the Saviour is then put in contrast with the testimony of John, inspired as he was, his testimony was only a testimony, and a prophetic and earthly testimony: Christ came from heaven, and spoke of what He Himself had seen and heard, not as a prophet, whether, of future things, recalling the law of Moses, the servant of God, or of a Messiah to come, and even upon the earth; no, Jesus spoke of the actual things which existed there whence He had come.<a name=157:1></a> No one received His testimony, for these were heavenly things, things which existed in God's presence, of which He spoke: man did not understand them, and did not want them.<a name=157:2></a> But the nature of the testimony was nevertheless divine; it was no longer the Spirit "by measure," a "Thus saith the Lord," where the prophet, having finished, all was said -- perfect truth, but truth limited to that which was expressed -- and again, it was of earthly things, the veil not being rent.<a name=157:3></a> The truth itself was there, the Spirit without measure (up to that time upon Him alone), filling Him with the things that were found there whence He was.<a name=157:4></a> He whom God had sent always spoke the words of God Himself in all that He said, and that in a man, and by a man, but who was the Son of God, and by the Spirit without measure.<a name=157:5></a>

		It is very possible that the last two verses of the chapter are by the evangelist, and not by John the Baptist, as it has been thought; but I see no peremptory reason why they should not be by the latter.<a name=157:6></a> Up to the end of verse 34, it seems clear to me that they are the words of John the Baptist; and John mingles his testimony with the things he relates, the whole being of God.<a name=157:7></a> The last verse might make one think that the words are those of the evangelist, as they contain a testimony so often repeated in his writings.<a name=157:8></a> There is also in the testimony a change analogous to what we have seen in verses 16-18 of chapter 1, as to the use of the name of God, and of that of Father.<a name=157:9></a> We must here notice carefully this fact, that the thing in question is not to know whether the testimony of the two verses is of God, but that it is only for our instruction, and as an interesting subject for our hearts, that we may take into account the person who was the vessel of this testimony.<a name=157:10></a> The Spirit of God committed the word to John the Baptist; the same Spirit directed the evangelist, whether in bringing to our memory that which John the Baptist said, or in the words which he himself pronounces.<a name=157:11></a> The last two verses, however, seem rather the expression of a reality that the evangelist knew and possessed by the Holy Ghost, as a present and actual thing, than a prophetic testimony, however high it might be.<a name=157:12></a>

		The difference between the names of God and of Father is always distinctly maintained in John's Gospel.<a name=158:1></a> When it is a question of the nature, and of the acting of God according to that nature, as the origin of redemption, and of the responsibility of man, the word God is employed; when it is a question of the grace which acts in Christianity, and by Christ in us, it is the name of Father.<a name=158:2></a> Thus "God so loved the world"; and in chapter 4, "God is a Spirit, and they that worship him, must worship him in spirit and in truth"; but, in grace, "the Father seeketh such to worship him"; and here, "the Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hands.<a name=158:3></a>" (Compare chapter 13: 3.<a name=158:4></a>) The Father has been revealed in the Son, and we have received the Spirit of adoption; the little children in Christ have known the Father.<a name=158:5></a> "The only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath revealed him"; and on the other side, "No one hath seen God at any time.<a name=158:6></a>" Thus the Person of the Son come into the world, and for us, the exaltation of Jesus, after He had accomplished the work which the Father had given Him to do, then the descent of the Holy Ghost, in a word, the grace which operates in the Person, and for us, by means of the work of Jesus -- there is where we find the Father revealed.<a name=158:7></a> Jesus revealed this name to His disciples, although they had understood nothing of it (John 17: 26); and now that the work which purifies us and justifies us has been accomplished, we have received the Spirit, by whom we cry, "Abba, Father.<a name=158:8></a>" The name of Father is a name of relationship, revealed by the presence of Christ, and which one knows and enjoys individually by the Holy Ghost.<a name=158:9></a> This is what characterises Christianity, and we may say, Christ Himself.<a name=158:10></a> <i>God</i> is what God is in His nature and His authority, the name of a Being, not of a relationship, except in the rights of absolute authority that belong to Him; but of a Being who, being supreme, enters into relationship with us, in grace.<a name=158:11></a> We see the importance of this distinction in the words of Christ Himself.<a name=158:12></a> During the whole of His life He does not say, "my God," but, "my Father," even in Gethsemane; and the enjoyment of this relationship is perfect.<a name=158:13></a> "I am not alone, for the Father is with me.<a name=158:14></a>" He says again, "Father," when He explains what it is for Him to drink the cup.<a name=158:15></a> On the cross He said, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?<a name=158:16></a>" Made sin for us, He felt what it was to be it before God, God being what He is.<a name=158:17></a> After His resurrection He employs the two names of God and of Father, when He introduces His disciples into the position into which He entered, from that time forth, as Man, according to the righteousness of God.<a name=158:18></a> "I ascend unto my Father, and your Father, unto my God, and your God.<a name=158:19></a>" His own were, by grace, as Himself, in their relationship with God as Father; they were, by His work, before God such as He is in His nature, and that in righteousness, according to the value of the work that He had accomplished, and according to their acceptance in His Person, well pleasing in the Beloved.<a name=158:20></a> But what a wonderful privilege to know what the Father's affections are set upon and to know Him who is the object of them, and who is worthy of them -- who suffices for these affections!<a name=158:21></a> What happiness to know the Lord, for the Father wills that there where He finds His delight we should find ours.<a name=158:22></a> What perfect, infinite happiness!<a name=158:23></a>

		Let us notice here, that in these first three chapters we have a preface to the Gospel, before the public ministry of the Saviour.<a name=160:10></a> The fact is established in chapter 3: 24, compared with Matthew 4: 12, 17, and Mark 1: 14, 15.<a name=160:11></a> John 4 confirms this appreciation of the facts.<a name=160:12></a> No doubt Jesus had already taught and performed miracles, but He had not yet publicly presented Himself, so as to say, "The time is fulfilled.<a name=160:13></a>" He announces Himself thus in Luke 4: 18 and following verses, although His preaching then in the synagogue at Nazareth was not His first, as verses 15 and 23 testify.<a name=160:14></a> But this preface of the first three chapters is really an introduction to the whole of Christianity, at least in its great and divine roots.<a name=160:15></a> It begins with what Christ was in His essential nature, and what man, alas!<a name=160:16></a> was also.<a name=160:17></a> It is not yet a question of God's acting in grace.<a name=160:18></a> It was the light; man was darkness; it was necessary to be born of God in order to receive Him who was it.<a name=160:19></a> Then we find that which He became; the Word was made flesh, and the only-begotten Son revealed God, being Himself in the bosom of the Father; it is grace in His Person.<a name=160:20></a> Then we have His work in all the extent of its effect, and the gift of the Holy Ghost, so that we may enjoy it now.<a name=160:21></a> And then the work of gathering, but this latter carried on on the side of the ways of God more upon earth, but in general according to the rights of the Person of Christ, the Jews, except the remnant, being set aside.<a name=160:22></a> Christ, recognised by this remnant according to Psalm 2, passes on, and presents His place, according to Psalm 8, as far as that regards His Person; after which the espousals and their joy, as well as the judgment, are brought in.<a name=160:23></a> But it is by resurrection, in raising Himself from the dead, in raising His own body, God's true temple, that the demonstration of His title and power will be given.<a name=160:24></a> That which is subjective in us, and the work for us, follows; His reception, according to human conviction, founded upon miracles, was worth nothing; it was what was in man; whilst, to see the kingdom, and to enter into it in its earthly and Jewish form, one must be born entirely anew.<a name=160:25></a> But there were also the heavenly things which Jesus revealed.<a name=160:26></a> He came from heaven, He was there -- He alone could announce the heavenly things.<a name=160:27></a> And the natural man, too, was not fit to enter in; it needed that He who had undertaken his cause, whether for the glory of God, or for man's guilt (for the new birth does not purify the conscience), it needed that the Son of man, unless He should remain alone, should be lifted up.<a name=160:28></a> But then it was not merely entrance into the kingdom, and the enjoyment of the promises, which were thus found, but eternal life, that which is in Christ Himself.<a name=160:29></a> The blessed source of all is given to us after that; God so loved the world, that He gave His Son, that we might live eternally.<a name=160:30></a> Thus we find, first of all, the righteous necessity, that which the nature and rights of God over man demanded, accomplished by the Son of man, then God's infinite love revealed.<a name=160:31></a> The Son of God had become Son of man, but the Son of man could take this place, because He was Son of God.<a name=160:32></a> At the end of chapter 3 we find the testimony of John the Baptist carried to its highest point, a witness of the deep and perfect personal piety of him who bore it.<a name=160:33></a> Still, he was of the earth -- more than a prophet, yet always earthly; of dust, and speaking as being of the earth, belonging to that which was outside the veil, not yet rent.<a name=160:34></a> Christ came from within the veil, and His flesh was this veil.<a name=160:35></a> He spoke of that which He knew thus, and no one received His testimony.<a name=160:36></a> John had the joy of hearing the voice of the Bridegroom; he was not that; that which he said was given of God as testimony, but the testimony being borne, all on his part was accomplished.<a name=160:37></a> Christ was Himself the subject of the testimony, and, more than this, the words He spoke were God's words, for God did not give the Spirit by measure.<a name=160:38></a> All His words were God's words; He was above all.<a name=160:39></a> Finally, we find still one thing remaining to complete this revelation of Christ, and of God Himself, in the great elements which were in connection with Christ's Person and our state: the Father and the Son are presented to us.<a name=160:40></a> This is the crowning point of all in grace; He was the satisfying object of all the Father's divine affections, He in whom the infinite and perfect love of the Father found its delight: also to Him He had given all.<a name=160:41></a> As Son, come down here, Jesus receives all from the Father.<a name=160:42></a> But the Father and the Son do not remain alone in the plenitude of their perfection; we are brought into it to enjoy it, although, in a certain sense, they remain necessarily alone in their perfection.<a name=160:43></a> But he who believes in the Son has eternal life already, although down here in weakness; he possesses subjectively that which, later on, will be his glory with Christ.<a name=160:44></a> (Compare the first verses of chapter 1.<a name=160:45></a>) Now this revelation of the Father in the Son became the definitive test of man: he who did not receive this testimony, who did not submit to Him by faith, should never see life, but the wrath of God abode upon him.<a name=160:46></a> That which refers to the Holy Ghost, whom those only who had believed in Jesus should receive, is already found in verses 32-34 of chapter 1.<a name=160:47></a> The development of the subject is found in the Saviour's last discourses; the history of His presence is to be found in the Acts and the Epistles, and in the consciousness of His presence which believers possess.<a name=160:48></a>

		The rejection of the Messiah by the Jews is already stated in chapter 1; the judgment of the people, which results from this, shews itself clearly in the course of the Gospel, and in many of the chapters.<a name=162:2></a> The doctrine of each chapter is often in contrast with Jewish things, this contrast furnishing the occasion and basis of the doctrine.<a name=162:3></a> Another characteristic feature flows from it; the judgment bears on all the world (chapter 1) that had not known Him, and upon His own, the Jews, who had not received Him; it opens the way for the establishing and development of sovereign grace which alone produces the divine life in us.<a name=162:4></a> This implies the admission of the Gentiles into the enjoyment of the blessings of grace, and then the important fact that these blessings would be found in a world, and also in a state, altogether new, into which one enters by the resurrection.<a name=162:5></a> In the synoptical Gospels Christ is presented in His three characters of Jesus Emmanuel, the Messiah; of Prophet; and of Son of man; His history being traced in these three points of view, with the account of His rejection and death.<a name=162:6></a> In John, who shews us God manifest in flesh, His rejection is established at the beginning; for, being light, the darkness did not receive Him.<a name=162:7></a> The result is, that, unlike the three other Gospels, where Christ is presented historically to be received, and where His rejection is recounted to us, but in connection with man's responsibility, John though he affirms this responsibility as doctrine, presents to us the sovereign grace which, we have already seen, sought His sheep among Jews and among Gentiles, for life eternal.<a name=162:8></a> Finally, we must not let pass without notice, the feature, that in John all is individual; he never speaks of the church.<a name=162:9></a>

		After the introductory chapters, the Gospel of John begins by shewing us Jesus leaving Judea, and quitting the Jewish capital, the centre of the throne of God on the earth, the ancient seat of Him who, now come down in grace, could not find where to lay His head in an adverse world.<a name=163:1></a> The jealousy of the Pharisees gave occasion to the departure of Jesus.<a name=163:2></a> But here already we can perceive that the Lord, having the consciousness of an origin and of a purpose which went beyond all the thoughts even of those who had received Him, does not act to gather together those who received His word, according to the thoughts of the disciples who surrounded Him with affection: Jesus Himself baptised not, but His disciples.<a name=163:3></a> The Word made flesh, Son of God, Saviour of the world, Redeemer, Son of man, He could not baptise in order to attach them to Himself as Messiah, although He was the Messiah; for He knew too well His rejection, and, as Peter expresses it, the sufferings which were to be the portion of Christ, and the glories that should follow.<a name=163:4></a> As to what was outside His position, Jesus could but allow His disciples to baptise thus; for them it was the truth, even the whole truth, although they had learned to add "living" to His title of Son of God.<a name=163:5></a> But if He Himself had baptised, He would have been entirely below the consciousness which He had of the object of His coming, and of that which was going to happen: it was not the truth for Him; although He was truly the Messiah, He came not to take this place then, but to give His life a ransom for many.<a name=163:6></a> That which drove Him away from Jerusalem, hindered Him also from baptising.<a name=163:7></a> The city where formerly He had been seated between the cherubim, and whose children He had often desired to gather together, drove Him from its neighbourhood; He went away, the despised and rejected of men, without having where to lay His head, to carry the testimony of God's love elsewhere, and to display it in His Person.<a name=163:8></a> This supposed that He was rejected as Messiah; but more, God manifested in grace, and coming, according to the promises made to the Jewish people, He was the last test of the human heart, which was thus found to be enmity against God, and against God come in grace.<a name=163:9></a> It was a question, then, of God's sovereign grace when man would not have Him; it was necessary then that He should be found quite apart, that He should have nothing down here -- He who, coming amongst men to bring them love, a love which answered to all their necessities, was at the same time light for their consciences, put Himself within the reach of all, used their very necessities to gain them in love, but called them to the enjoyment of heavenly things, which He, and He alone, was able to reveal to them.<a name=163:10></a>

		But to arrest the attention of a soul, however useful this may be, is not to convert it: the moral communication between the soul and God is not yet established by the knowledge of oneself and of Him; the eyes are not yet opened.<a name=167:1></a> Thus the heart remains in its natural surroundings, absorbed, or at least governed, by the circle in which it lives.<a name=167:2></a> The poor woman, attracted by the Lord's manner, which had gained ascendency over her, asks Him to give her of this water, so that she need no longer come there to draw laboriously.<a name=167:3></a> All true intelligence was wanting to her: she was absorbed by her weariness and labour, and the circle of her thoughts went no further than her waterpot, that is to say, than herself, but herself possessed by her circumstances.<a name=167:4></a> This is human life, and people judge of revealed things by their relation to these circumstances; sometimes we find moral truth, as here; sometimes open unbelief.<a name=167:5></a> How can an entrance be found into the heart of man?<a name=167:6></a> This is easy for God, and for man this entrance is found when God is there, and reveals Himself, and man's conscience is touched.<a name=167:7></a> "Adam, where art thou?<a name=167:8></a>" He hid himself, because he was naked.<a name=167:9></a> All was out.<a name=167:10></a> The fig-leaves that could set him at ease in hiding him from himself were simply nothing when God was there.<a name=167:11></a> The first manifestation of this new faculty in man, conscience, this sad but useful companion that always goes with him now through his career, as a part of his being is, for God, the only door of entrance to the heart, and for man, of intelligence.<a name=167:12></a> Only here it is love, never weary, that acts.<a name=167:13></a> God and the sinner are found each in his true place; man, responsible entirely known of God, but feeling that all is known, and that He who knows him is there.<a name=167:14></a>

		I dwell a little on this point, because it is the opposite of the entrance of paradise; it is not paradise regained, or even that which is much better, but the soul receiving subjectively truth and grace in the Person of Jesus, who gives it the capacity for this.<a name=167:15></a> In either case its state of sin is revealed to the soul; but in paradise it was to judge, and begin a world where God was not, but where Satan reigned; here sin also is manifested, but God is manifested in this same world in love; formerly light and judgment; now, light and grace.<a name=167:16></a> All understanding as to the gift of God, of the Person of Christ, of eternal life, was wanting, and had no place in the woman's heart.<a name=167:17></a> "There is none that hath understanding.<a name=167:18></a>" But whilst, formerly, God had driven out man, here love remains perseveringly near the sinner; when it is God, love is persevering and patient.<a name=167:19></a> Only all must be real: "Go, call thy husband, and come hither.<a name=167:20></a>" "I have no husband," replies the woman.<a name=167:21></a> It is shame which, though speaking the truth, hides the evil; not an upright conscience before God.<a name=167:22></a> But patient love still carries on its work; it pursues it there, where entrance is found into the understanding -- or rather into the soul of man, which is thoroughly wanting in understanding as to divine things -- conscience.<a name=167:23></a> "Go, call thy husband.<a name=167:24></a>" Then, upon her answer, the Lord tells the woman enough of her history to make her know that she has to do with Him before whom all is naked and laid bare.<a name=167:25></a>

		The work was going on in this soul; her attention, we have said, had been arrested.<a name=168:1></a> The effect deserves to be well considered; the woman neither excuses herself, nor is astonished, nor asks, How dost thou know this?<a name=168:2></a> The word of God is for her the word of God.<a name=168:3></a> "Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.<a name=168:4></a>" She does not only say, That which thou sayest is true; no, the authority and source of the word of Jesus were for her divine.<a name=168:5></a> All He says comes from God, who reveals Himself by this means among men.<a name=168:6></a> This is a deep change in the soul's condition.<a name=168:7></a> God has spoken to her, and she has recognised that it is He; but more, that His word, as a whole, as a source, is of Him.<a name=168:8></a> What she thought was, not only that Jesus, in this particular case, spoke the truth, although that was the means by which her conscience was reached, but God was speaking to her conscience, and that always produces the effect we see here: He who was speaking was a true and sure source of divine communications.<a name=168:9></a> It was faith in the word of God, the soul brought into communication with Him: all that He said had for her a divine authority.<a name=168:10></a> Divine intelligence was there with regard to the things in which God was drawing near to man.<a name=168:11></a>

		Nevertheless the woman was still pre-occupied with that which filled her mind: Ought we to worship at Jerusalem, or on Mount Gerizim?<a name=169:1></a> It was the external aspect of what existed, and her mind had been exercised about these things: Where was God to be found?<a name=169:2></a> -- but in a way which did not go beyond what was in man.<a name=169:3></a> God takes the opportunity of revealing the true, the new worship, the worship of the Father, of God, in spirit and in truth.<a name=169:4></a> This change characterises the whole of the chapter, that is, the introduction of heavenly relationships in the place of the earthly Jewish system, a change which depended upon the revelation of the Father in the Son, a change but little known as yet, but which was necessarily connected with His Person, and of which consequently, He could say, "the hour now is" (verse 23).<a name=169:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Two things, based upon the revelation which was being made, characterised this worship; the nature of God, and the Father's grace.<a name=169:6></a> The worship of the true God must be a worship "in spirit and in truth.<a name=169:7></a>" God's nature required this; God is a Spirit; and the worship would not be according to what God is, if it were not "in truth," for what is false is not according to what He is, and the revelation of that which He is has come in Christ, who is Himself the truth, for "grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.<a name=169:8></a>" The law given by Moses told what man ought not to do, and the Lord knew well how to find in this law that which man ought to feel; to love God and his neighbour.<a name=169:9></a> But the law does not reveal what God is, it reveals what man ought to be.<a name=169:10></a> Now here was God fully revealed in the world, who, rejected as Messiah, object of promise, leaves His special connection with the Jewish people, although it had been (outside that which was earthly and legal) established by Himself, and comes to reveal Himself in the Person of the Son, substituting God amongst men, in grace, for all the forms in the midst of which, hidden behind the veil, He forbade all men to come near Him -- to reveal Himself I say, to all this ignorance, which worshipped she knew not what, and where there was no answer whatever to the needs of the heart.<a name=169:11></a> It was the Father seeking true worshippers in spirit and in truth, according to His own nature fully revealed; for "God is a Spirit, and they that worship him, must worship him in spirit and in truth.<a name=169:12></a>" But grace precedes; the initiative is with God; He comes Himself to seek such worshippers.<a name=169:13></a> We have seen that it was the gift of God; but God is Light, and He reveals Himself.<a name=169:14></a> It is, we have also seen, God revealed in goodness, but the conscience reached by the light, and God giving that which springs up unto everlasting life.<a name=169:15></a>

		Thus it is the grace of the Father which seeks, the light of God that acts on the conscience, grace which gives divine life, according to the presence in power of the Holy Ghost, and all the truth which unfolds itself in this: this is what produces true worship in spirit and in truth.<a name=170:1></a> All that belongs to Jerusalem and Samaria is necessarily left behind by the presence of God Himself, the Son revealing the Father, and communicating eternal life in connection with heavenly things; the Messiah being rejected, and the Father's heart being the source of all, which places us necessarily in connection with heaven, by Him who can reveal these things, Himself the Son of the Father.<a name=170:2></a>

		We may remark here that our Gospel speaks of the revelation of the Father in the Son; of what God is, who is the object of worship; of that which reaches the conscience; of eternal life; but not of that which purifies the conscience.<a name=170:3></a> This last subject is not that which John treats of in his Gospel, but John speaks of the revelation of God the Father in the Son; of this revelation for judgment, as to its result, and according to grace, as to its object; it is the Son in the world, to reveal His God and Father, and as eternal life.<a name=170:4></a> At the end of the Gospel, the Holy Ghost is introduced in place of the Son, that we may know Him as Man in heaven at the right hand of God.<a name=170:5></a>

		We find an example of the isolation of the Lord in the total want of intelligence in the disciples, when the Lord opens His heart, in the joy that the prospect of the conversion of sinners gave Him -- of the fruit of His ministry.<a name=170:6></a> Except communion with His Father, which He always enjoyed, the Lord had no joy upon earth but in the exercise of His love in the good that He did.<a name=170:7></a> that was worthy of God.<a name=170:8></a> Perfect whilst being truly Man in His communion on high, and exercising His love down here, He went about doing good.<a name=170:9></a> Such was His whole life, except the sufferings He endured at the hands of men, He, a Man of sorrows, and knowing well what languor was.<a name=170:10></a> Not that He was without human affection: He loved Martha, and Mary, and Lazarus; He loved him whose Gospel we are reading; but this does not appear till His hour had come.<a name=170:11></a> He defers all expression of it until then, explicitly as to His mother, and, as we see in the history, as to what concerns John and the family at Bethany.<a name=170:12></a> In His ministry He was wholly for His Father, and for the sinners of the world; His meat was to do the will of Him that sent Him, and to finish His work (verse 34).<a name=170:13></a>

		The result for the woman, who received a flood of fresh light in her soul, and who, even while being enlightened, had suddenly too much light to see distinctly, is, that she refers it to Christ.<a name=171:1></a> God had brought it about by a real work in her conscience.<a name=171:2></a> She thought that if only she had the Christ (for Him she believed in, and knew He was to come), He would tell her all clearly, and make her know all things.<a name=171:3></a> It is there that the woman was brought; and Christ was there before her.<a name=171:4></a> It is always thus.<a name=171:5></a> Many questions arise in an awakened and sincere soul, but when Christ is found, all comes out clearly, there is a full answer to all the soul's needs: all is found.<a name=171:6></a> But who was He who had acted upon the heart and conscience of this poor woman, and who had been good to her, when He knew all that she had done?<a name=171:7></a> When the word of God reaches the conscience, it is not the flesh that acts, it is the Saviour-God, who has been there all along.<a name=171:8></a>

		There is another interesting little circumstance to be remarked here.<a name=171:9></a> We have seen the isolated woman bowed down under the burden of life, whose ill-requited labour was represented by the pitcher: she was absorbed by it, her heart could not throw it off: now (and it is not for nothing that the Holy Ghost presents to us these little touches) the pitcher is entirely forgotten.<a name=171:10></a> The woman does not seek isolation any longer; she goes to announce to everyone what she has found; this Man was surely the Christ (verse 28, 29).<a name=171:11></a> No doubt she had to draw water again, but the burden that weighed upon her soul was taken off, the energy of a new life was there.<a name=171:12></a> What she said touched very nearly on her shame; but Jesus filled her heart, and she can talk of these things, in finding Christ there -- Christ who preoccupied her by the light of His grace: "Come, see a man who hath told me all things that ever I did; is not he the Christ?<a name=171:13></a>" When she got home, she could think of the gift of God, and of Him who had said to her, "Give me to drink"; but all her further life is lost in the splendour of the revelation of God in Christ.<a name=171:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may remark that the reapers gathered fruit unto life eternal, and also received their hire.<a name=171:15></a> The prophets had laboured (the woman was expecting the Christ), also John the Baptist.<a name=171:16></a> The disciples were only reaping, but the fields were white unto harvest.<a name=171:17></a> In the very worst times, when judgment even is close at hand, God has His good part, and faith sees it, and is consoled by it.<a name=171:18></a>

		The following episode, in which the illness of the courtier's son is related to us, begins, I think, to unfold to us the great elements of the revelation of God in the Person of the Son, first of all in healing that which remained in Israel, but ready to perish.<a name=172:7></a> Further on He shews that man is dead spiritually; but there were in Israel quickened souls, as we see indeed in the beginning of Luke.<a name=172:8></a> But all was going to perish; the nation was going to be judged, was going to terminate its existence under the old covenant, no longer to subsist in relationship with God as a vessel of blessing.<a name=172:9></a> But He who is the Resurrection and the Life was there, to awaken and sustain life individually, to be its bread, there, where faith received Him.<a name=172:10></a> He shewed this, too, at Jerusalem, but it began naturally in Galilee, in the midst of the poor of the flock, where He went when He was driven out of Judea.<a name=172:11></a> Faith receives the word of Christ, and He who is the Life and who brings it, re-animates it taking away weakness, and communicates life.<a name=172:12></a> This application that we make of physical restoration is fully sanctioned by the use the Lord makes of it in the following chapter.<a name=172:13></a> The principle and faith are equally simple here; the father believed in the power of Jesus, but his faith was like that of Martha, Mary, and the Jews; he believed that Jesus could heal<a href="#172:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> -- nothing more.<a name=172:14></a> He prays the Lord to come down before his son dies.<a name=172:15></a> Jesus would have men believe on a word, and not only in seeing signs; however He does not raise the question of the power to quicken, but He has compassion on the poor father, making everything depend, nevertheless, on faith in His word, when He says to the father, "Thy son liveth.<a name=172:16></a>" The father believes the word of Jesus, and goes away; on the way he meets his servants, and they announce to him that his son is healed, and that this was so at the very moment when Jesus said the word.<a name=172:17></a> "And he believed, both he and all his house.<a name=172:18></a>" The power of death had been arrested by the power of life come from above, and the man that had profited by it believed in Him who had brought it, and who was it; for in Him was life.<a name=172:19></a> (Compare 1 John 1: 1-3 and chapter 5: 11, 12.<a name=172:20></a>)

		There were needs in Israel at that time, needs of the soul, as well as of the body, and a consciousness of these needs.<a name=173:7></a> The Lord could say, "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.<a name=173:8></a>" The poor paralytic man is the type and figure of this.<a name=173:9></a> In order that the object of the blessings which were enjoyed under the law should be able to profit by them, he must have power in himself.<a name=173:10></a> Whether it be to have righteousness according to the law, or whether to enjoy other blessings, there must be, in the man who wished to possess them, a subjective state fitted for this; there must be power in man.<a name=173:11></a> The paralytic man's disease had deprived him of that power which was necessary in order to profit by the means of healing.<a name=173:12></a> It is the same thing as to sin.<a name=173:13></a> The blessings and means which the law offers, demand strength in man.<a name=173:14></a> The desire to be healed is supposed -- "Wilt thou be made whole?<a name=173:15></a>" The Lord puts the question thus.<a name=173:16></a> Power was wanting, as in Romans 7, to will was present.<a name=173:17></a> Jesus brings with Him the power that heals; the good which He does, does not demand power in us.<a name=173:18></a> It was when we were deprived of all strength that His grace acted.<a name=173:19></a> (See Romans 5: 6.<a name=173:20></a>) In John, we must remember, it is a question of life; even when he speaks of the cross, it is for eternal life, not for pardon.<a name=173:21></a>

		We shall now see what this work is which the Father and the Son are doing, for it is of them that he speaks, of these names which John always uses in speaking of the operations of grace.<a name=175:1></a> He says, indeed, that <i>God</i> so loved -- which is the source and foundation of all; there the Son of man and the Son of God, and God Himself, are introduced as source and foundation of all blessing; but when the subject is the operations of grace, in John, we always find the Father and the Son.<a name=175:2></a>

		The Jews understood perfectly the position which Jesus took, and sought to kill Him.<a name=175:3></a> The Lord does not refuse this position which the apostle John recognises as His (for in verse 18 it is John who speaks); but He puts everything in its place.<a name=175:4></a> All that the Father does, He does it; but it is not as another, a second and independent authority, that He acts.<a name=175:5></a> He does that which the Father does, and He does nothing else: He acts in agreement with the Father, and moved by the same thought as He, and He does an things that the Father does.<a name=175:6></a> But having taken the form of a servant, He does not leave it, and whilst declaring Himself one with the Father (for before Abraham was He was the "I AM"), He receives all, in the position He has taken, in these operations of grace, and in their fruits in glory, from the Father's hand.<a name=175:7></a> This is striking in this Gospel, where the divine side of His Person is more fully brought out than in the others, although it be not more definitely affirmed.<a name=175:8></a> We find constantly that when He speaks of being on the same footing as His Father, He places Himself, nevertheless, ever upon the ground of receiving all from Him.<a name=175:9></a>

		Jesus then goes on here to the work which, in fact, was being accomplished, and is being still accomplished, whether by the Father, or by the Son only, and He does all that the Father does.<a name=175:10></a> There is one work which He does as Son of man, and which the Father does not.<a name=175:11></a> "Father" is the name of grace and relationship; "Son of man," that of conferred authority.<a name=175:12></a> If the Father and the Son work, it is a work of grace that is in question.<a name=175:13></a> But the Father has not been humbled; He remains in the unchangeable glory of the Godhead.<a name=175:14></a> All judgment is committed to the Son, so that those who shall have despised Him, will be compelled to recognise Him by this means.<a name=175:15></a>

		But let us take the instructions of the passage in their order.<a name=176:1></a> The Son does more than heal; "for as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them, even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.<a name=176:2></a> For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son: that all men should honour the Son even as they honour the Father.<a name=176:3></a> He that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father which hath sent him" (verse 21-23).<a name=176:4></a> Thus the Son's glory is maintained in a twofold manner, in that like the Father He quickens, and this we can understand, for we are in relation with the Father and the Son, as partaking of the divine life; then by judgment, for the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment to the San, that all may honour Him.<a name=176:5></a> Those who are quickened, honour Him with all their heart, and with goodwill; those who do not believe, judgment will compel to honour Him, in spite of themselves.<a name=176:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To which of these two classes do I belong?<a name=176:7></a> The 24th verse furnishes us with the answer to this question -- a simple, complete answer, and full of precious light.<a name=176:8></a> "Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment, but is passed from death unto life.<a name=176:9></a>" The word of Christ is that which is presented to the soul, to bring the glad tidings of grace: the effect produced, where this word is received, is faith in the Father as having sent His Son.<a name=176:10></a> But He who thus believes in the Father as sending His Son, grace and truth thus come in Him, has eternal life.<a name=176:11></a> That is one side of the answer; he who believes is quickened.<a name=176:12></a> We have seen that this is one means of ensuring the Son's glory: the other means is not mixed up with this one.<a name=176:13></a> If Christ has quickened, it is not to put His work to the test of judgment; that is impossible: Christ would judge His own work, and would call in question its efficacy; and who is the judge?<a name=176:14></a> The consequence is evident: the other means of ensuring Christ's glory is not employed; he who has received life does not come into judgment.<a name=176:15></a> I limit myself to what the passage before us says; otherwise we should remember that He who sits as Judge is the same One who bore the sins of all those who believe.<a name=176:16></a> But John does not treat this side of the subject: to judge him who believes, would be to call in question the quickening work of Christ, and that of the Father also.<a name=176:17></a>

		Here is what is precise and formal as to the two things by which the Son is glorified; that is, the quickening of souls, and judgment; the first which He accomplishes, in common with the Father; the second, which is entrusted to Him alone, because He is the Son of man.<a name=177:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is not all that is said here.<a name=177:2></a> He who has eternal life is "passed from death unto life.<a name=177:3></a>" It was not a cure: the soul had been spiritually dead, separated from God, dead in its trespasses and sins, and it has come out of that state of death by the quickening power of the Saviour.<a name=177:4></a> It is not merely that, being quickened, it escapes the consequences of its responsibility when the day of judgment shall come: the Lord has taken the other means, in grace, of glorifying Himself with regard to it.<a name=177:5></a> The soul was already dead: it is the teaching of the Epistle to the Ephesians: a new creation.<a name=177:6></a> The unrepentant sinner will come into judgment, if he who is under grace escapes it.<a name=177:7></a> But we are all dead now; it is the state of us all already: we are dead as regards God, without a single sentiment which answers to what He is, or to His call, and if it were a question merely of that which is found in man, it would be impossible to awaken any.<a name=177:8></a> But God communicates life, and the soul passes from death unto life.<a name=177:9></a> It is a new creation; we become partakers of the divine nature.<a name=177:10></a> At the same time it ever remains true that we shall give account of ourselves to God, that we shall all be manifested before the judgment-seat of Christ; but it is not a question there, for us who believe, of any judgment as to our acceptance.<a name=177:11></a> We are in the glory, like Christ, when we get there; Christ Himself will have come in person to seek us, that we may be there, and He will have changed the body of our humiliation into conformity to His body of glory.<a name=177:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us continue to study our chapter.<a name=177:13></a> The Father quickens; the Son also quickens and judges.<a name=177:14></a> The hour was coming, and had then already come, when it would not only be the Messiah, Jehovah Himself, who would heal the sick in Israel, in keeping with the promises and prophecies given to Israel according to the government and discipline of God in the midst of His people, working a cure which might give place to a more severe discipline; but from this time quickening power and eternal life in the Person of the Son, who revealed the Father in grace, were come, so that the dead should hear the voice of the Son of God, and those that should hear it should live (verse 25).<a name=177:15></a> This was the great proclamation as to life: it was there, and as the Father had life in Himself, He had given to His Son, a Man upon earth, to have life in Himself -- a divine prerogative, but here found in a Man, come in grace upon earth.<a name=177:16></a>

		I have already noticed that, while shewing us in Christ things which belong to God only, and that absolutely, in the Gospel of John, the Son, having become Man and Servant, never leaves the position of receiving everything.<a name=178:1></a> He has received authority also to execute judgment, because He was the Son of man.<a name=178:2></a> But one might be judged upon earth, and in fact the living will be judged there.<a name=178:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There still remains an important part of His power which belongs to the teaching of this chapter: the dead shall rise again, and, according to that which has already been declared in verse 24, life and judgment are not mingled here.<a name=178:4></a> Men were not to marvel that the souls who should hear His voice would live by the spiritual life which He could communicate: the hour was coming (and that hour was not yet come, and is not yet come) when <i>all</i> those who are in the graves shall hear His voice, and shall come forth .<a name=178:5></a>.<a name=178:6></a>.<a name=178:7></a> .<a name=178:8></a> It is no longer here, "those who shall hear shall live," but <i>all</i> shall hear, and shall come forth; those who have done well to the resurrection of life, those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment.<a name=178:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Notice carefully, that, although the judgment assigns to each one his place according to his works, it is not the judgment that separates the risen; the resurrection itself makes the separation.<a name=178:10></a> Those who have done well have not part in the same resurrection as those who have done evil.<a name=178:11></a> He does not here speak of the interval of time which separates the resurrection of the one from the resurrection of the other; that must be sought in the revelation that God gives of the dispensations.<a name=178:12></a> Here it is a question of the essence of things: there is a resurrection, which is that of the just, called thus; and another resurrection, distinct from the former, a resurrection of judgment, in which the living, glorified in the first, do not participate.<a name=178:13></a> Sometimes, indeed, a difficulty has been raised as to the word, "hour," which is employed here, but it is a poor argument, for the same expression is found again in verse 25, which presents to us as an "hour," a space of time which has lasted nearly two thousand years, and which comprises two distinct states of things -- one in which Christ upon earth acts personally, and the other, in which Christ glorified acts by the Spirit.<a name=178:14></a> These two epochs, nevertheless, make up but one "hour," from the point of view in the passage; it is the same thing here.<a name=178:15></a> The first <i>hour</i> is the period during which Christ quickens souls; the other hour, the period of verse 28, is that during which Christ raises bodies.<a name=178:16></a> This is quite simple; one of these hours, as I have said, has already lasted more than eighteen centuries.<a name=178:17></a>

		Having declared these great truths, which reach to the end of God's ways with men, in His Person, as to life, and as to judgment, Christ goes back to the great principle which was at the very beginning of His discourse; that is, that He could do nothing as an independent Person from the Father.<a name=179:1></a> If it had been otherwise, it would have been, indeed, the denial of that bond between Him and the Father in which they were one, and which was found in everything, with this additional fact, that He had the form of a servant, of One sent by the Father.<a name=179:2></a> He did nothing of His own will: according as He heard, He judged, and His judgment was just, for He sought not His own will in anything, but that of the Father who had sent Him (verse 30).<a name=179:3></a> No selfish motive whatever was to be found in His manner of viewing things, but the judgment which He formed, whatever it might be, flowed from the communications that the Father made to Him: this was divine perfection.<a name=179:4></a> He acted as Man, and as sent, but He did so according to the immutable perfection of God, not of Himself as a Man, which would not even have been human perfection, but forgetfulness of Him whose Servant He had become.<a name=179:5></a> Still, it was as Son of man, in this title of glory as of grace, of Him who had been humbled, that He executed judgment with authority.<a name=179:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The rest of the chapter treats of the question of man's responsibility as to life, as that which precedes presented to us the sovereign grace that gives life.<a name=179:7></a> Divine life was present in the Person of Jesus, and God had vouchsafed four testimonies to men that it was there: the testimony of John Baptist; the works which the Father had given Him to do; the Father Himself; and the Scriptures.<a name=179:8></a> They had been glad to rejoice in John the Baptist for a time, for the people held him to be a prophet.<a name=179:9></a> Now John had borne a clear testimony to the Lord on the part of God.<a name=179:10></a> Then the works of Jesus were an unexceptionable testimony that the Father had sent Him: the Father had given Him these works to do, and He did them.<a name=179:11></a> The Father Himself also had borne witness to Him: the multitude had thought they heard thunder; but His word did not dwell in them, for they believed not Him whom He had sent Finally, they had got the Scriptures; they boasted of this, they thought to find eternal life in them; and what they did was to bear witness to Christ, to Jesus, who was there before their eyes.<a name=179:12></a> The Life was there, living before them; they had these testimonies, but they would not come to Him, that they might have life.<a name=179:13></a> The life was there, but they would not profit by it (verse 40).<a name=179:14></a> It was not that the Lord sought glory from men; but He knew them, and knew that they had not the love of God in them.<a name=179:15></a> He was come in His Father's name, revealing what He was; they would not receive Him, alas!<a name=179:16></a> because He revealed Him perfectly.<a name=179:17></a> Another should come in his own name, with human pretensions, and adapted to man's heart, not to God's heart, him they would receive (verse 43).<a name=179:18></a> Terrible prophecy of that which shall happen to the people, as a consequence of their rejection of Jesus, and of the motives which impelled them to reject Him.<a name=179:19></a> The Antichrist will deceive them in the last days, because he will come with pretensions and motives adapted to the heart and desires of carnal men; the Jews will give themselves up to his deceptions and pretensions.<a name=179:20></a> The state of their souls hindered them from receiving the truth; they sought to receive honour and esteem from men, not the honour which comes from God alone.<a name=179:21></a> They were not following the path of faith, but quite the contrary; not that the Lord would accuse them before the Father: Moses, in whom they boasted, sufficed for that.<a name=179:22></a> He, in whom they placed their confidence, bore the most explicit testimony to the Lord.<a name=179:23></a> If they had believed Moses, they would have believed Jesus also: Moses had written of Him.<a name=179:24></a>

		It is important to remark one or two things here: first of all, the clear testimony which the Lord bears to the writings of Moses; the writings were the writings of Moses; he had written concerning Christ.<a name=180:1></a> That which he had written was the word of God; one must believe what he said.<a name=180:2></a> More, that which is written is authority pre-eminently, as Peter says: "No prophecy of scripture"; and Paul, "Every scripture is inspired of God.<a name=180:3></a>" Besides, it is evident that if men ought to believe in what Moses had written of Christ so many centuries before His coming, that which Moses wrote was divinely inspired.<a name=180:4></a> It is evident that what Jesus said had divine authority; but as to the form of communication, the Lord attaches more importance to that which was written, than to that which was communicated by the living voice: God had deposited it there for all times -- a very important testimony for these days of infidelity.<a name=180:5></a>

		CHAPTER 6
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The fifth chapter presented to us Christ quickening whom He will in common with the Father, then judging as the Son of man.<a name=181:1></a> It is Christ acting in His divine power.<a name=181:2></a> In the sixth chapter He is the food of His people, as Son of man come down from heaven, and dying.<a name=181:3></a> It is not His quickening power in contrast with the obligation of the law, but <i>who</i> He was, the history of His Person, if I may dare to say so -- that which He is essentially, that which He became -- a history which terminates by His entering again as Son of man there where He was before: it is essentially the humiliation of Jesus in grace, in contrast with that which He was in right of enjoyment, with that which was promised in the Messiah when He should be upon earth.<a name=181:4></a> The teaching of this chapter embraces all, from His coming down from heaven, until He enters it again, so that in descending and ascending, He fills all things; but this teaching rests especially on the Lord's incarnation and death, in connection with which He gives eternal life, and introduces His own into the glory of the new creation, far above and beyond all that an earthly Messiah could give.<a name=181:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Jesus went away beyond the sea of Galilee, and sat there upon a mountain with His disciples.<a name=181:6></a> Now the passover was near; and this fact gives the tone to all the discourse we have here.<a name=181:7></a> Lifting up His eyes, Jesus sees the multitude that had followed Him, and asks Philip where they should buy bread for all this people, knowing well what He would do.<a name=181:8></a> The disciples think, not according to the thoughts of faith, but considering the resources upon which man can calculate; one thinks of what would be needed, the other, of what there was.<a name=181:9></a> There was indeed an immense disparity between the five loaves of bread and the five thousand men.<a name=181:10></a> Now one of the promises made for the time of the Messiah, was, that Jehovah would satisfy His poor with bread (Psalm 132); and Jesus accomplished this promise, working a miracle, which had its effect on the crowds which surrounded Him; there was abundance, and there remained over and above.<a name=181:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This gives occasion (verse 14-21) to a kind of framework of the Lord's whole history, a history in which He replaces the Messianic blessings by spiritual and heavenly blessings which should be consummated in resurrection, upon which He insists four times in the course of the chapter.<a name=182:1></a> He is recognised as the Prophet who was to come; they wish to make Him a king; but He avoids that by going up to pray alone, and the disciples cross the sea without Him.<a name=182:2></a> They are looked upon here in the character of the Jewish remnant; still, it is this that has become the Christian assembly.<a name=182:3></a> But these few verses give us, as I have said, the framework of Christ's history, recognised as Prophet, and refusing royalty, to exercise priesthood on high, whilst His people cross the waves of a troubled world with difficulty.<a name=182:4></a> As soon as Jesus rejoins them, they arrive at the place where they were going; difficulties are over, their goal reached: here the disciples represent entirely the Jewish remnant.<a name=182:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The multitude rejoin the Lord on the other side of the sea, astonished to find Him there, knowing that there was not, where He had been, any other boat but that of His disciples.<a name=182:6></a> The Lord accuses them of seeking Him, not because they had seen the miracle, but because they had eaten the loaves, and had been filled, and He invites them to seek that food which abides unto life eternal, which the Son of man would give them; for Him had God the Father sealed (verse 26, 27).<a name=182:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the fifth chapter Jesus is Son of God; here, Son of man, and we shall see what faith in Him as such works.<a name=182:8></a> The legal question of the crowd (verse 28), rather vague and trivial, introduces this development.<a name=182:9></a> What shall we do (they say), that we may work the works of God?<a name=182:10></a> This is the work of God (the Lord replies), that ye believe on Him whom He hath sent.<a name=182:11></a> Thereupon they ask of Him a sign, led of God in their question, remembering the gift of the manna in the desert, as it was written: "He gave them bread out of heaven to eat.<a name=182:12></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This quotation introduces directly the doctrine of the chapter.<a name=182:13></a> Christ was the bread.<a name=182:14></a> It was not a question of shewing a sign to men; He was Himself the sign of God's intervention in grace, in His Person as Son of man come down here upon earth, and not as Prophet, or Messiah, or King.<a name=182:15></a> My father gives you the true bread which comes from heaven.<a name=182:16></a> The Father -- it is always He when it is a question of active grace -- gave them the bread of God.<a name=182:17></a> The true bread, in its nature, is He who cometh down from heaven, and giveth life to the world.<a name=182:18></a> This goes entirely outside Judaism: it is the Father, the Son of man, He who comes down from heaven, and whom God gives for the life of the world; not Jehovah fulfilling the promises made to Israel by the coming of the Son of David, although Jesus was this indeed.<a name=182:19></a> Like the poor Samaritan woman -- but impelled here by a vague need of the soul, they ask that the Lord would give them part in this bread of God which gives life.<a name=182:20></a> This furnishes the occasion for the full development of the teaching of Jesus.<a name=182:21></a> "I am the bread of life.<a name=182:22></a> He who cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth in me shall never thirst" (verse 35).<a name=182:23></a> If you would have bread for ever which is food indeed, come to Me; you shall never hunger.<a name=182:24></a> But, adds the Lord (for such was Israel's state, always thus looked upon in John), ye have seen Me, and ye believe not.<a name=182:25></a> If it be a question of you, and of your responsibility, all is lost: the bread of life has been presented to you, and ye would not eat of it, ye would not come to Me to have life; but the Father has counsels of grace, He will not allow you all to perish.<a name=182:26></a> "All that the Father has given me shall come to me"; for grace, sovereign and certain in its effects, is clearly taught in this Gospel: since it is the Father who has given him to Me, I will never cast out the one that comes to Me, however wicked he may have been, or insolent enemy of Myself.<a name=182:27></a> The Father has given him to Me, and I am not come to do My will, but the will of Him that hath sent Me.<a name=182:28></a> What a humble place the Lord takes here, although all was fulfilled at His expense!<a name=182:29></a> He had made Himself a Servant, and He accomplishes the will of another only, the will of Him who sent Him (verse 38).<a name=182:30></a>

		This will is now presented to us in a double aspect, and in a very striking manner: "This is the will of him that sent me, that of all that he hath given me, I should lose nothing.<a name=183:1></a>" Their salvation is assured by the Father's will, the fulfilment of which nothing can hinder.<a name=183:2></a> But it is in another world that the blessing will take place.<a name=183:3></a> It is no longer here a question of Israel and of the Messiah, but of the resurrection at the last day.<a name=183:4></a> The expression, "the last day," which we find four times in this part of the chapter, designates the last day of the legal dispensation in which the Messiah was to come, and will come.<a name=183:5></a>

		The course of these dispensations has been interrupted by the rejection of the Messiah when He came, which has given place to the introduction of heavenly things, which are brought in parenthetically between the death of the Messiah and the end of the weeks of Daniel.<a name=183:6></a> Those whom the Father gives to Jesus will enjoy as raised, the heavenly blessing which the Father's love keeps for them, and which the Son's work assures to them.<a name=183:7></a> Not one of them will be lost: all will be raised by the power of the Lord.<a name=183:8></a> Such are the unfailing counsels of God.<a name=183:9></a>

		The Jews murmur because the Lord said that He had come down from heaven.<a name=184:7></a> They saw the Son, and did not believe in Him: they knew Him after the flesh; He was, for them, Joseph's son.<a name=184:8></a> The Lord then insists upon the fact, that no one can come unto Him unless the Father draw him; He insists upon the necessity of grace to be able to come, not that every one was not free, as people say, to come, for whosoever should see the Son, and believe on Him, would have eternal life; but He shews that the mind of the flesh is enmity against God.<a name=184:9></a> There is the blinding of sin, of the flesh, and hatred of God, as far as He reveals Himself; there is none that understandeth, none that seeketh after God; so that the power of grace is needed to dispose the heart to receive Christ.<a name=184:10></a> Now when the Father draws to Jesus, it is by efficacious grace in the heart: the eyes are opened, one passes from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God; one passes into a salvation assured by Christ, who will raise up such a soul at the last day.<a name=184:11></a> It is the revelation of Jesus to the soul by the grace of the Father: the soul sees the Son, it receives eternal life, it shall never be lost, but raised up at the last day.<a name=184:12></a> It is important to observe, that he who is drawn by the Father will never be lost, and that at the last day he will have his part with the redeemed in an entirely new world, in an entirely new state.<a name=184:13></a> Such a soul is taught of God to recognise the Son; the Father has spoken to it; it has learned of Him; it comes to Christ, and is saved; not that any one hath seen the Father, save Christ Himself.<a name=184:14></a> Christ had revealed Him, and he who believed in Christ had everlasting life (verse 47).<a name=184:15></a> Solemn but precious assurance!<a name=184:16></a> Eternal life has come down from heaven in the Person of the Son, and he who believes in Him, possesses it, according to the efficacious grace of the Father, who draws him to Christ, and according to the perfect salvation that Christ has accomplished: his faith lays hold, as to life, of this Son of God, who will manifest His power later on, in raising the redeemed one from among the dead.<a name=184:17></a>

		As we have seen, the multitude, under the hidden direction of God, had alluded to the manna, asking some similar sign of the Lord.<a name=185:5></a> Jesus had said to them (a touching reply!<a name=185:6></a>): I am the sign of God's salvation, and of eternal life sent into the world; I am the manna, the true bread, which the Father, God acting in grace, gives to you: "He that comes to me shall never hunger, and he that believes on me shall never thirst.<a name=185:7></a>" I recall all this, although we have already spoken of the verses which follow, in order to bring together what is said about the bread, and I pass now directly also to verse 48.<a name=185:8></a> "I am the bread of life.<a name=185:9></a> Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.<a name=185:10></a> This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die .<a name=185:11></a>.<a name=185:12></a>.<a name=185:13></a> .<a name=185:14></a> If any one shall have eaten of this bread, he shall live for ever.<a name=185:15></a>" Here it is Christ come down from heaven, the incarnation, setting aside all idea of promise; it is the great and mighty fact, that, in the Person of Jesus, people saw Him who was come down from heaven, the Son of God become Man, as we see in the first chapter of the First Epistle of John: "that which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have contemplated, and our hands handled, concerning the word of life .<a name=185:16></a>.<a name=185:17></a>.<a name=185:18></a> the eternal life which was with the Father, and has been manifested to us.<a name=185:19></a>" It was as to His Person, not yet as to our entrance into it, the beginning of the new order of things.<a name=185:20></a> Come of a woman, so that, according to the flesh, He was connected with the human race, Son of man, but still come down from heaven, one with the Father, in order that we might have part in this life, that we might be of this new order of things, He must needs die; otherwise He remained alone.<a name=185:21></a> But He had taken this flesh; He had been made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, having taken this flesh, which He was going to give for the life of the world.<a name=185:22></a>

		The first great point, then, was the incarnation, Christ come down from heaven, the Word made flesh -- life in Him -- and to give eternal life to him who should eat Him.<a name=186:1></a> The second point is, that Christ gave this flesh for the life of the world.<a name=186:2></a> He must die, close all relationship with the world, and the lost human race, by death; and begin a new seed, that He would not be ashamed to call His brethren, because He that sanctifieth, and they that are sanctified, are all of one; then, redemption<a href="#186:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> being accomplished, He would introduce them, risen, into the glory of the Father's family, according to the counsels of that Father who had given them to Him.<a name=186:3></a> This arrests the Jews: How could this Man's flesh be eaten?<a name=186:4></a> But Jesus does not spare them.<a name=186:5></a> He is, thus known, eternal life.<a name=186:6></a> It was no longer a question of conciliating the Jews, but of giving salvation and eternal life to the world by faith in Him, who had come from heaven for this, and of presenting to the Father those whom the Father had given to Him, such as the Father would have them in His love, and in His counsels, according to His nature, if they were to be in His presence.<a name=186:7></a> If they did not eat His flesh, and drink His blood, they had not life.<a name=186:8></a> In themselves there was none for that new world of glory, that blessed race.<a name=186:9></a> For that, it was necessary that a divine and heavenly life should come down from heaven, and be communicated to souls, and that in a Man; it was necessary that this Man should die, and terminate all relation with the fallen race, and risen, should begin a new race,<a href="#186:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a> possessing the divine life (inasmuch as they had appropriated Christ to themselves by grace), and which should be raised again by the Saviour's power, when the moment should come, "at the last day.<a name=186:10></a>"

		This work is accomplished.<a name=187:1></a> Now it is not of its efficacy to redeem our souls that we are speaking at this moment, nor of the pardon which we enjoy in virtue of its accomplishment, precious as these truths may be, but of the connection which there is between these divine events and the possession of life, in virtue of which we have part in this redemption and in this pardon, with all the consequences which flow from them.<a name=187:2></a> Christ is received in His incarnation; but, though the incarnation preceded necessarily, historically, the Saviour's death, I do not think that one can really seize the bearing of this life of humiliation, unless one first enters into that of His death.<a name=187:3></a> Personally, the new thing, as we have already said, was presented in His Person -- a Man, God manifested in flesh, but He in whom was life, He who was this eternal life which had been with the Father, and which was now manifested to the disciples.<a name=187:4></a> But, in this state, the corn of wheat remained alone, however productive it should be; in order to introduce those whom God gave to Him into the position of the last Adam, of the second Man, it was necessary that He should die, that He should give up His life in this world, to take it again in the state of resurrection, beyond sin, death, the power of Satan, and the judgment of God, after having passed through all these things, and having taken again His life of Man, but in a spiritual and glorified body.<a name=187:5></a> Now His death was, morally, the end of man driven out of paradise; His resurrection, the beginning of the new state of man, according to the counsels of God.<a name=187:6></a> Now man in Adam had no life in himself; he had not the life of God, and, in order to have it, he must understand and receive not only the incarnation, or a promised Messiah, but the judgment on the first man, borne by Christ's death; he must enter, as to himself, into the conviction, the realisation of this state thus shewn forth, although in grace, in the Saviour's death.<a name=187:7></a> He who appropriated to himself the death of Christ, accepted this judgment with regard to himself, when sin (not sins) was condemned in another.<a name=187:8></a> Sin in the flesh, which is enmity against God, has been condemned for us.<a name=187:9></a> In receiving by faith Christ's death as the absolute condemnation of that which I am, I have part in the efficacy of that which He has done: sin has been before God, and has disappeared from before His eyes in the death of Christ, who, however, had not known it.<a name=187:10></a> I say to myself, That is I.<a name=187:11></a> I eat it; I place myself there by the operation of the Spirit of God, not that I believe that it is for me personally, but I recognise what His death signified, and I place myself in it by faith in Him.<a name=187:12></a> There, where I was, in death spiritually, by sin and disobedience, Christ entered in grace and by obedience, for the glory of His Father, in order that God might be glorified.<a name=187:13></a> I recognise my state in His death, but according to the perfect grace of God, according to which He took my place there; for it is in this that we know love, that He laid down His life for us.<a name=187:14></a> Now, if one died for all, then were all dead.<a name=187:15></a> By faith and repentance I recognise myself there, and I have eternal life.<a name=187:16></a> Now I can follow Jesus through the whole of His life, even the fact of His having been a Man down here, and I can feed upon this bread of life, upon all His patience, His grace, His gentleness, His love, His purity, His obedience, His humility -- upon all that perfection of every day, and all the day long, which ended only at the cross, where all was consummated.<a name=187:17></a> "He who eateth me shall live for ever.<a name=187:18></a>" I have everlasting life, and Jesus will raise me up at the last day.<a name=187:19></a>

		We have still some points to notice in this chapter.<a name=188:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The verb, "to eat," is employed in it in two different tenses.<a name=188:2></a> He who has eaten, has eternal life; he who, by grace, has taken his place in the death of Christ, outside of all promise, of all title of any kind whatsoever, feels that he depends upon the sovereign grace that has placed Christ there, and believes in it.<a name=188:3></a> He who shall have eaten of this bread, shall live for ever.<a name=188:4></a> But in verses 54 and 56 we have the character of the man, and his eating is a present thing.<a name=188:5></a> Two things are the consequence of it: first, he has eternal life, and shall be raised up; secondly, he who feeds upon this bread, dwells in Jesus, and Jesus in him: first of all, general blessing, with salvation present and to come; then communion, and the permanent presence of Jesus with us, and even in us.<a name=188:6></a> For as the Father, who has life in Himself, sent Jesus, and Jesus lived because of Him, as inseparable from Him, so he that eateth Christ shall live, because of the life that is in Christ.<a name=188:7></a> "Because I live, ye shall live also.<a name=188:8></a>" It is a union in life, by grace, with Jesus: life in us is inseparable from Him; we live because He lives.<a name=188:9></a> He is our life.<a name=188:10></a> As He is inseparable from the Father, and even as Man down here, living because of the life that was in the Father, this life in Him could not be separated from the Father, and our life should not be separated from Jesus.<a name=188:11></a> That is the bread which came down from heaven, that one may eat of it, and not die.<a name=188:12></a>

		We may also notice that the passage before us comprehends more than a single discourse.<a name=189:1></a> The beginning refers to the moment when the crowds met the Lord again after He had crossed the sea, whilst the last part was spoken in the synagogue at Capernaum (verse 59).<a name=189:2></a> The Jews were scandalised at it, taking what He said literally, and thinking that Jesus wanted them to eat His flesh; many of His disciples even said, "This is a hard saying, who can hear it?<a name=189:3></a>" The Lord appeals to the fact, that He was going to ascend up where He was before.<a name=189:4></a> He was not an earthly Messiah, but a heavenly Saviour, come from heaven into this world, come down into this world, in order to accomplish that which was necessary to make us ascend up there, to give eternal life to man, and to raise him up when the moment should come, to give him a part in the second Man, in the Man and in the world of God's counsels and grace, an eternal part in His favour, by redemption, according to His counsels in grace.<a name=189:5></a> It was not a succession of dispensations, a Messiah come in glory to terminate them, a Son of David according to the promises; but it is He (and that as a present thing) who came down from heaven to communicate eternal life, and to place the believer in heaven, as to the state of his soul, and finally, as to his body, fit for the light and the divine glory.<a name=189:6></a> But to have part in this, one must see Him who came down, not only in humiliation, as the bread come down from heaven, but who has been rejected, such as He was, by man, in order to enter into the presence of God, according to the true state of humanity which was enmity against God -- passing through death and judgment, when He was made sin for us -- and recommencing His life of Man in an entirely new state, beyond death and judgment.<a name=189:7></a> All relationship of God with the first man being impossible, save by the cross, where Christ in grace made a Substitute for the believing sinner met with God; man, dead in trespasses and sins, must know Him in this character, recognising there his own state; that is to say, in Christ dead, made sin, and sin condemned in Him.<a name=189:8></a> But the believer, in the fact that he died in thus identifying himself with Christ, as with Him who was made that which man is really himself, and who endured the penalty of it -- in this fact, the believer, I say, is dead unto sin, he who before was dead in his trespasses and sins, for he has known himself there where Christ died to sin.<a name=189:9></a> Christ died there in grace, as sin condemned before God; and the sinner says to himself, That is really myself; I am that in the flesh; and now, Christ having offered Himself for that, God has made Him sin for us; but Christ, in dying, has done with sin, and therefore I have done with it too.<a name=189:10></a> There is, then, no existing relationship between God and the race of the first Adam: the death of Jesus has made evident this fact, when God had tried everything, even to the gift of His Son.<a name=189:11></a> God has done with all this race of the first man upon the cross; and as for me, I have done with sin, which was the basis of all this.<a name=189:12></a> Oh, how marvellous and perfect are God's ways, full of infinite grace!<a name=189:13></a>

		I recall also that it is not here a question of our present heavenly position; John, as we have said elsewhere, hardly ever speaks of it.<a name=190:1></a> Christ will raise up the believer at the last day.<a name=190:2></a> He speaks of His own ascension to complete the truth: come from heaven, He will go back there; but He does not associate us with Himself in heaven as a present fruit of His work.<a name=190:3></a> For us, He passes from His ascension to the resurrection of our bodies.<a name=190:4></a>

		One remark more.<a name=190:5></a> I have spoken of the incarnation and of the death; and, as to that which is reached here, it is the knowledge of these things that sets us clear, and that delivers us.<a name=190:6></a> But the Lord says, in verses 40, 47, that He is come, that whosoever believeth in Him <i>may have</i> everlasting life, and that he that believeth on Him <i>hath</i> everlasting life; so that whosoever really sees the Son of God in the despised Man of Nazareth, has everlasting life.<a name=190:7></a> The Lord, however, does not hide the bearing of this fact; His rejection, His death, could but be the consequence of His presentation to a world such as the one in which we live, and of which we are according to the flesh; it is important we should know it.<a name=190:8></a>

		In answering the Jews, offended at the fact of His ascension, Jesus adds, that it is the Holy Ghost that quickeneth -- the flesh profiteth nothing -- that He did not speak as though they were to eat of His flesh in a material sense.<a name=191:1></a> The words He spoke to them were "spirit and life.<a name=191:2></a>" It was by the word that spiritual things were communicated; and by the power and by the action of the Spirit they become realities, and living realities, in the soul, a real part of our being.<a name=191:3></a> But the Lord knew well that there were, even amongst those who followed Him as His disciples, persons who believed not, and He told them so; He well knew, too, who it was who should betray Him.<a name=191:4></a> These were the branches that were to be cut off, and that have been.<a name=191:5></a> Jesus must walk in the midst of those whom He knew to have no root, of whom He knew even that they would betray Him, and He adds: "It is for this that I said unto you, that no man can come unto me, unless it be given unto him of the Father" (verse 65).<a name=191:6></a> From that time many of His disciples left Him, and walked no more with Him.<a name=191:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is striking to see how the Lord would have that which was true, divine, permanent, and nothing else.<a name=191:8></a> That which had led many to follow Him was not hypocrisy; there were, no doubt, hypocrites, but many had come under the influence of a passing impression, which wore off in presence of the difficulties of the way, and before the stumbling-block which was found in the truth, or rather in the prejudices which the truth offended.<a name=191:9></a> Jesus therefore said to the twelve, "Will ye also go away?<a name=191:10></a>" Simon Peter, always ready to put himself forward, prompted by a warm affection, but full of an ardour which sometimes betrayed him, and involved him in a path, out of which it could not take him with an undefiled conscience, this time becomes, happily, the mouthpiece of all to express true faith.<a name=191:11></a> There was with him -- with all of them -- (not to speak of Judas) a real need, to which Jesus alone answered.<a name=191:12></a> This is very important.<a name=191:13></a> It does not at all appear that Peter had understood what Jesus had said: he knew not how to accept the sufferings of his Master, who called him Satan on that occasion when the flesh shewed the supremacy it exercised over him.<a name=191:14></a> Still, the root was there with Peter; the need of possessing eternal life was awakened in him; he was conscious that this life was only to be found in Jesus, and that He was the sent One of God, come from God; Jesus possessed the words of eternal life.<a name=191:15></a> Whatever want of clearness might be in Peter's views, Peter thought of eternal life, with the need of possessing it himself; he believed and knew that Christ had the words which revealed it, and, by grace, communicated it, and that He was the Holy One of God, the One whom the Father had sanctified, and sent into the world.<a name=191:16></a> True faith was there, as well as the needs which God produces.<a name=191:17></a> There was not knowledge either of the deep truths which Christ was teaching, or of the persons for whom Peter answered, when he said, "we"; but the needs of the soul were there, as well as faith in the words and in the Person of Christ.<a name=191:18></a> Thus, through many falls, Peter was kept to prove himself to be faithful to the Saviour to the end, and the Lord confided to him the sheep and lambs He loved -- the apostle's ministry amongst the Jews -- and also gave him to be the first who should bring in a Gentile.<a name=191:19></a> It is interesting to see that if the knowledge of the truths taught in this chapter was wanting, if there was true faith in the words and in the Person of Jesus, as sent of God (not merely as a prophet who spoke that which God gave him to say, but as being personally <i>the</i> Holy One of God, who had the words of eternal life), one possessed this eternal life, one possessed all.<a name=191:20></a>

		CHAPTER 7
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The fifth and sixth chapters, which we have just been through, contain the doctrine of the Person of Christ: the fifth chapter presents Him as the life-giving Son of God, the sixth chapter, as Son of man come down from heaven, dying for men, and thus an object of faith.<a name=192:1></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the fourth chapter Jesus had left Judea, to go into Galilee: it was there that He stayed, and presented Himself to the people; He would not walk in Judea any more, for the Jews sought to kill Him.<a name=192:2></a> The occasion of this special hatred was His having healed the paralytic on the sabbath-day, and that He presented Himself as Son of God, making Himself equal with God.<a name=192:3></a> The first of these acts set aside the Jewish system -- not only according to the law, but in that which was the seal of the covenant, and the sign of the part which the Jews had in the rest of God; the second was the introduction, in His Person, of an entirely new system: later on, the healing of the man born blind excited their anger, as we shall see, God willing.<a name=192:4></a> A little remnant only attaches itself to Him, with a true, though ignorant, faith, receiving only that which was necessary to have salvation, namely, Christ and His words, as He presented Himself to them; but, I repeat, by a true faith given by God.<a name=192:5></a>

		We find therefore now, in the seventh chapter, the Lord's refusal to present Himself to the world, His brethren's unbelief, and the declaration that the time was not come for Him to celebrate the feast of tabernacles.<a name=193:1></a> But this needs some development.<a name=193:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There were three great feasts of the Jews: every male who was a grown up man had to go to Jerusalem to celebrate them; these were, the Passover, Pentecost, and the Feast of Tabernacles.<a name=193:3></a> The antitype of the Passover is found in the cross; that of Pentecost, in the descent of the Holy Ghost; but the antitype of the Feast of Tabernacles is still wanting: no event answers to it.<a name=193:4></a> Nevertheless, the ordinances established for this feast throw light upon that which should be its antitype.<a name=193:5></a> The Feast of Tabernacles derives its name from the fact, that the Israelites, once entered into the land of Canaan, ought, according to the law, to live during eight days in huts, made of branches of trees, bearing witness thus that they had been pilgrims in the desert, but that God, in His faithfulness, had brought them into the promised land.<a name=193:6></a> Moreover, this feast was celebrated after the harvest, and after the vintage, two events employed everywhere in Scripture as figures of the judgment: the harvest, of the judgment, which separates the good and the bad upon earth; the vintage, of the extent of vengeance on enemies, when Christ shall tread the wine-press.<a name=193:7></a> The fulfilment of this feast will take place when Israel shall no longer be dispersed, but shall enjoy the effect of the promises which God has made to them, after the judgment which will separate the tares from the good grain, and after that vengeance has been executed, the wine-press of God trodden, according to Isaiah 63, by the Lord Himself.<a name=193:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the time for these things was not yet come when Christ was upon the earth; it was needful for their accomplishment that He should be manifested in glory.<a name=193:9></a> To give life as Son of God He could; to suffer as Son of man, it was what He had before Him; but to shew Himself to the world, to fulfil in power all the promises made to Israel, after having judged and destroyed His enemies; for that the moment was not yet come.<a name=193:10></a> What He was going to do, but after His rejection and death down here, was, being glorified, to give His Spirit to believers (verse 37-39).<a name=193:11></a> The bread come down from heaven He was; as to dying and shedding His blood, that was soon to happen to Him; but if it were a question of judging, of accomplishing the promises down here, and of shewing Himself to the world, it could only take place later on, when He would take His great power, and act as a King.<a name=193:12></a> In the meantime, having ascended on high, He was going to give His Spirit, until He returned.<a name=193:13></a>

		Such is the teaching of this chapter: we are going to consider some details of its contents.<a name=194:1></a> Times are of God, as well as facts.<a name=194:2></a> It was not then for Jesus the time to shew Himself to the world, nor to observe the feast of Tabernacles.<a name=194:3></a> All times suit those who are of the world to profit by that which is worldly They are of the world, and float with its current.<a name=194:4></a> The world does not hate them: there, where God's testimony is, is the object of its hatred.<a name=194:5></a> An upright mind may be struck by the testimony that God bears to the truth, but there is not in this, sufficient motive to break with those who desire opposition, and it is this that the intelligent leaders of evil always desire.<a name=194:6></a> Besides, in the world there are opinions for or against a thing, not a conviction of heart and conscience, and thus a need for oneself: it is there that the soul meets with God, and braves the world (chapter 6: 68).<a name=194:7></a>

		The Lord does not go up to the feast, but when His brethren had gone up, then He also went up, and He taught in the temple (verse 9, 10).<a name=194:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us notice, in passing, that we must not confound the people and the Jews.<a name=194:9></a> The people were composed of Galileans and others, who had come to take part in the feast; the Jews were those of Jerusalem itself, or at least of its environs.<a name=194:10></a> Thus, in verse 20, the people did not know that they wanted to kill Jesus; those of Jerusalem, on the contrary, well knew what they were plotting there against Him (verse 25).<a name=194:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Jews, accustomed to listen to the rabbis, were astonished that Jesus, an illiterate Man from their point of view, could teach as He did.<a name=194:12></a> His doctrine was of the Father, not human.<a name=194:13></a> The means of understanding it was a state of soul answering to such a mission; the desire to do the Father's will would recognise the word which came from Him (verse 14-17).<a name=194:14></a> The moral state of the soul, the single eye, is the means of receiving, of intelligently discerning, the doctrine that comes from the Father; the conscience is open, the heart quite ready to receive the truth.<a name=194:15></a> Many things in the teaching may go beyond the knowledge possessed by such a soul; but the teaching answers to its needs; it bears to it the impress of truth, of holiness; it suits God; there is not self-seeking; the good of souls is sought, the conscience is sounded, however dealing in grace.<a name=194:16></a> Now there is a conscience in all men; and here the desire to obey is supposed.<a name=194:17></a> Such a man discerns that which is of God, when God speaks.<a name=194:18></a> It is not reasoning which convinces the mind: reasoning never convinces the will; but the desire being there, it is God who adapts Himself in His teaching to the wants and to the heart of man.<a name=194:19></a> It is the truth here, the words of God Himself.<a name=194:20></a> But amongst the Jews, and in the mass of the people, all was in confusion.<a name=194:21></a> Without scruple as to circumcising, and thus as to violating the sabbath by working, the divine power which healed by a word exercised no influence over them, unless that of producing in them the desire to put to death Him who had given this proof of the goodness and of the power of God, whose rights were beyond even the sabbath.<a name=194:22></a> This confusion amongst the unbelievers is striking.<a name=194:23></a> Those who came from a distance jeered at the thought that some wished to kill Jesus: those of Jerusalem, who wished to kill Him, on account of the miracle He had done, were astonished that He spoke thus freely, and asked themselves if the rulers had then recognised Him as the true Christ; nevertheless, said they, "when Christ cometh, no one will know whence he is" (verse 27).<a name=194:24></a> Further, they wished to take Him; but, says the evangelist, no one laid hands upon Him, because His hour was not yet come.<a name=194:25></a> God's ways are sure.<a name=194:26></a>

		Some details of the Saviour's teaching mark out His position, before He speaks of the promise of the Holy Ghost, and after the discussion which took place about the desire to kill Him, when they made the remark, that they knew not whence the Christ would come.<a name=196:2></a> Jesus formally declares that they knew whence He came, but that they did not know the Father who had sent Him (verse 28).<a name=196:3></a> Terrible accusation!<a name=196:4></a> The proof was there in their conscience: they would not have wished, as they did, to get rid of Him, if they had not had the inward consciousness that He came from God.<a name=196:5></a> The proofs were there: the testimony in their conscience.<a name=196:6></a> The multitude (verse 25-27) seem to have had the same conviction in the main, although they excused themselves by the fact that they knew whence He came; to which the Lord replies, but in words the bearing of which went far beyond the application that the crowd, taught by tradition, could make of them to the Messiah's character.<a name=196:7></a> "Ye know me, and ye know whence I am.<a name=196:8></a>" Terrible testimony, the truth of which we see in the words of Nicodemus that are related to us, and which, although they do not go so far, attest the conviction that the miracles of Jesus were producing in hearts.<a name=196:9></a> It was their will that opposed itself to this condition, and if Pilate was able to discern the surface of their motives (they had delivered Him up through envy), he was not able to understand a hatred against God which decided to kill Lazarus, rather than allow the people to believe the coming in grace of the God, who had so often wished to gather them under His wings.<a name=196:10></a> They were disputing confusedly about the Messiah, and their God was there in grace, the Son sent by the Father.<a name=196:11></a> Their leaders knew very well, at bottom, that He who was doing these miracles, did them not by human power; they might attribute them to Beelzebub, but certainly not to man.<a name=196:12></a> The character of the miracles of Jesus, and the power that was manifested in them, confirmed His words: these shewed the source from which they came, and words and miracles shewed who He was, and whence He came.<a name=196:13></a> But they had no knowledge of the Father, of Him from whom Jesus came; they were not of those who desired to do His will, and they sought to blind others.<a name=196:14></a> The ignorant people strove, in the confusion, with some passing convictions; their leaders resisted, with an intelligent conviction that He who came from God was there, but decided not to receive Him.<a name=196:15></a> All this is developed further on, and affirmed by the Lord Himself (chapter 15: 22-24).<a name=196:16></a>

		It is important, painful though it be, to bring out clearly the state of this poor people, whether as to the leaders, or as to the mass: the mind of the former made up to reject Jesus; the moral, and, alas!<a name=197:1></a> wilful, blindness of the multitude.<a name=197:2></a> Jesus had no longer any place amongst them as Messiah; He must take a place far otherwise important and excellent -- that of Man at the right hand of God.<a name=197:3></a> Still, He was the Good Shepherd, and the porter opened to Him; and, accomplishing His will, He went through the dangers, and His sheep heard His voice.<a name=197:4></a> So it was at this moment; a great number, "many amongst the multitude," believed on Him, saying, "When Christ cometh, will He do more miracles than this man hath done?<a name=197:5></a>" (verse 31).<a name=197:6></a> Then the Pharisees send officers to seize Him, which becomes the occasion of a touching answer of Jesus, an answer which clearly sets forth the situation, "Yet a little while I am with you," says He, "and I go to him that sent me.<a name=197:7></a> Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me; and where I am ye cannot come.<a name=197:8></a>" You have no need to be in a hurry to seek Me, to get rid of Me; you will have Me for a little time longer, and then all will be over; it will no longer be a question of the Messiah; you will seek Me then, but you will not find Me.<a name=197:9></a> I go unto My Father; there you have no access.<a name=197:10></a> All will be changed; it will be all over as to the Messiah; the Son, as Man, will go to sit at the Father's right hand -- there you will not be able to come.<a name=197:11></a>

		At the beginning of our chapter 8, the law in man's hands, raised against outward immorality, but without uprightness, without life, and without grace, is put in a striking manner, in contrast with the word of God, that searches hearts, that turns the sword of the law against every one, and leaves room for grace, not quickening, or pardoning grace, but the grace which at least does not give its force to the law to condemn; that was not the Saviour's mission.<a name=201:1></a> The whole world was placed under condemnation by the law, if God were to apply it; God had not come for this; but in shewing them to be all condemned, without exception, on this ground, entire humanity disappears under the sentence of the law, at least the humanity which takes the law as a means of righteousness, and the ground is cleared to bring in the light of life, from God.<a name=201:2></a> The position of the adulteress is only negative; it is quite a different case from that of the woman that was a sinner, in Luke 7, where the full grace which saves is established.<a name=201:3></a> All were guilty, but the Lord was come to reach the conscience of all, not to apply the law to the guilty.<a name=201:4></a> He does not condemn -- only every mouth is stopped.<a name=201:5></a> The conduct of these men was wretched; sinners, like the accused one without mercy, and without pity, they desired to expose this woman, so that the Saviour might find her guilty; for, if He condemned her, there was no advance upon the law, He was neither Messiah nor Saviour; if He did not condemn her, He put Himself into opposition with the law of Moses.<a name=201:6></a> The scribes and Pharisees did not know with whom they had to do.<a name=201:7></a> The penetrating voice of God needs only a word to reach the conscience: "Adam, where art thou?<a name=201:8></a>" or, "Let him that is without sin among you cast the first stone!<a name=201:9></a>" -- suffice to lay bare the conscience, because the power of God is there, and man is found necessarily revealed to himself in the presence of Him who is light.<a name=201:10></a> But the will is not changed, and man avoids that presence; one takes refuge amongst the trees of the garden; others, rather with shame than with a sincere conscience which leads to confession, slink away, each one alone, to preserve his reputation; the eldest first, but fearing, even to the last, that presence which pierces them through, and ashamed of finding themselves in each other's presence.<a name=201:11></a> Then, having given the law its full force upon all, Jesus allows the poor woman to go away, according to divine mercy.<a name=201:12></a>

		After this, we have the doctrine with regard to the Saviour, which is connected with the preceding fact: "I am the light of the world" (verse 12), not yet here the Messiah of the Jews, but the presentation, on the part of God, of light in the world, light which manifested everything, but which remained alone, for the whole world was darkness, far from God, and the heart of man himself darkness.<a name=202:1></a> This light manifested the effect of even the law, it shewed where man was, as placed under it.<a name=202:2></a> But it was far more; if man followed it, it was "the light of life" (compare chapter 1: 4), that which made manifest as the revelation of the divine nature, but that which communicated life to those who received this light.<a name=202:3></a> It was an entirely new thing come into the world, God Himself, in the power of grace, become Man; rejected, all was morally judged; but, received by grace, it was the new life, the life eternal, for Christ is eternal life come down from heaven; 1 John 1: 1, 2.<a name=202:4></a> As light and life, it was for us, for it was communicated to us; the new man is created according to God in righteousness and holiness of truth, and there is also the renewing of knowledge according to the image of Him who created us.<a name=202:5></a> But it was the word of life, and it was a question of receiving that word; and here it is the light in conflict with darkness.<a name=202:6></a> All depends, as we shall see, on the Person of Him who speaks.<a name=202:7></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#204:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>This title of Son of man, which Jesus always takes, goes a great way further than that of Messiah. It is taken from Psalm 8 and Daniel 7; Jesus always takes it in contrast with that of "Christ," which He only gives Himself once, that is, at Sychar, in chapter 4; but He constantly adds to it His death upon the cross. (See Luke 9: 21, 22.) It is the second Psalm that regards Jesus as Messiah, and shews Him to us rejected as such, but established in glory and authority later on by God.

		That which this chapter puts forward most distinctly, is, the divine character of Jesus, demonstrated by His words, and the diabolical character of the Jews manifested in the way in which they had received Him.<a name=205:1></a> Already, in verse 23, the Lord announced it, with the terrible testimony, that that which was of this world was from beneath, that is to say, of the devil, whilst He was from above, and not of this world.<a name=205:2></a> That which He said expressed His nature, His divine character.<a name=205:3></a> He reveals the Father: His words are the words of God; that which He said revealed Him to the world (verse 26, 27; chapter 1: 10; chapter 3: 32, 33).<a name=205:4></a> That which follows, on the other hand, throws into relief the character of the Jews.<a name=205:5></a>

		The Lord declares to those who had been brought to believe in Him, that, if they remained firmly attached to His word (for it is a question of His word), they should be His disciples indeed, they should know the truth, and the truth should set them free (verse 31, 32).<a name=205:6></a> The truth supposes the full revelation of that which is divine and heavenly, that which was revealed in His Person, and in His words, and would be fully made evident when He should be glorified, and the Holy Ghost should have come.<a name=205:7></a> I do not think that those of whom verse 23 speaks were those who believed in Jesus, but the Jews in general.<a name=205:8></a> They trust to their outward position according to the flesh: they had never been in bondage, they say, forgetting, however, all their history, and their position at that very moment.<a name=205:9></a> The Lord passes over all that, to present the ground of the truth as to the state of man before God, and the effect of the law; for He identifies these two things -- being a slave of sin, and being under the law, as the man of Romans 7 "Every one that practises sin, is the slave of sin," captive of that terrible law of sin that is in his members; but being a slave, he may be sent away from the house, and sold.<a name=205:10></a> The Jews, sinners under the law, would be sent away from the house of God; but the Son belonged to the house, and dwelt there always, and necessarily; if He made them free, they should be free indeed, free from sin, and free from the law.<a name=205:11></a> The Son, the revelation of the Father, as object, and power of life in him who shall have received Him, acting by the word, takes the place of the principle of sin in man, and the law which in vain forbade man to commit it.<a name=205:12></a>

		Outwardly the Jews were indeed the children of Abraham; but the word of Christ had no place nor entry into their hearts, and they sought to kill Him.<a name=206:1></a> Here the contrast becomes formal: Jesus spoke (for it is always His word) that which He had seen with His Father, Himself the Son who revealed Him, and announced that which was heavenly and divine; but this brought out of their hearts the Satanic hatred against God which fills the heart of man.<a name=206:2></a> Here, then, the two great principles of sin which characterise the adversary, manifested themselves in them -- murder, and the absence of the truth (verse 44, 45).<a name=206:3></a> This opposition between the revelation from above, and that which is in the world and from below, characterises the chapter, and forms its basis.<a name=206:4></a> Their descent from Abraham is for the Lord but a circumstance of no value.<a name=206:5></a> If, in the moral sense, the Jews had been the sons of Abraham, as the believer is, they would have done the works of Abraham; but instead of that, they sought to kill a Man who had told them the truth He had received from God.<a name=206:6></a> The Jews take still higher ground: Abraham no longer suffices for them, it is God who is their Father (verse 41).<a name=206:7></a> They are conscious that the words of Jesus come more home to them and they retire into the stronghold of their privileges.<a name=206:8></a> The Lord follows up the side of moral and essential truth, whilst avoiding, so to speak, to declare everything openly at once; but He is obliged, as it were, to say it, both as to them, and as to Himself.<a name=206:9></a>

		Until now we have had the revelation of the thing heavenly and divine, in itself, in a positive way, outside and above all that was Jewish; here we are come to the conflict between man's heart and this revelation, and there, where the privileges of a religion which was composed of the elements of the world (separated from Him who, all earthly as was this religion, was its centre), only blinded the more the hearts which made their boast in it.<a name=206:10></a> The divine word, in the Person of Jesus, the Father's word, which was in His mouth, pierced through all this religious drapery, and manifested man's heart.<a name=206:11></a> The Lord, in His answer to the assertion of the Jews that God was their Father, shews that the rejection of His Person gave the lie to such a pretension.<a name=206:12></a> The question was raised and decided by His presence and by His word: if they had had God as their Father, they would have loved Jesus, for He came from God; He did not come of His own will; God had sent Him.<a name=206:13></a> It was necessary to speak openly, for things were being fulfilled: truth, and hatred against the truth, against God, are found in presence of one another.<a name=206:14></a> The Jews did not understand the words, because they did not understand the things, a very important principle in divine things: in human things, words are explained, in order to learn what the things are; thus we but designate by a word things which come under the senses, or things of the intellect, for these things are within man's grasp; divine things are not so.<a name=206:15></a> If I say, "born again," to understand the words, I must know what it is to be born again.<a name=206:16></a> Let us remember this.<a name=206:17></a>

		The Lord allows no uncertainty to remain here any longer: you have the devil for your father, and you will do his works; and "he is a liar, and the father of lies" (verse 44).<a name=207:1></a> As we have said before, the double character of Satan and of sin, is to be "a murderer" and "a liar"; man has added to it corruption.<a name=207:2></a> Such was the character of these poor Jews.<a name=207:3></a> They did not believe Jesus, because Jesus spoke the truth, and they were going to kill Him.<a name=207:4></a> They claimed, indeed, to be of God -- sad and blinding effect of an official religion; but if they had really been, they would have listened to the words of God.<a name=207:5></a> There is a certain perception which belongs to the life of God, which recognises that which is of Him, and especially His words.<a name=207:6></a> It was, for a Jew, a monstrous thing, subversive of all his pretensions, of the whole divine history of the ages, to say to Jesus that He was not of God.<a name=207:7></a> Who, then, was He?<a name=207:8></a> A Pagan, a Samaritan?<a name=207:9></a> This was enough to shew whence Jesus was.<a name=207:10></a>

		Note here, that Jesus gave eternal life by His word; He was the accomplishment of the promises; but, again, He was God in this world; life and truth were on one side; murder and falsehood on the other.<a name=208:1></a> It is this that makes this chapter so solemn.<a name=208:2></a> That which, grace excepted, was the whole life of Jesus in the midst of this people, in this world -- the truth, the life, the sent One of the Father, God manifest in flesh -- in the presence of hatred of the truth and of God, are concentrated in this chapter, and are in presence of one another.<a name=208:3></a>

		It is important also to remark, that it is a question, not of miracles, but entirely of the word of Jesus.<a name=208:4></a> The Jews do not ask for a sign, as they often did: it is not the ordinary current of incredulity that we have here before us; but the truth, the light, are in direct conflict with the darkness which does not understand them, but which, at the same time, is troubled by them; for the light shines even when it is not received.<a name=208:5></a> It is not in man's heart; and that makes itself felt in the heart: nothing can be imputed to the witness which weakens the testimony; no one could convince the Lord of sin; they did not believe, because He told them the truth.<a name=208:6></a> Here it is the pure opposition of man's heart to the truth, because it was the truth.<a name=208:7></a> Light may reach the conscience, and if the will is not changed, this only produces hatred, as in the case of Stephen; but here, I repeat, it is the truth itself and the light that are in conflict with the darkness, He who came from above, with whom the Father was, and then men, who alas!<a name=208:8></a> were from beneath.<a name=208:9></a> What could be more solemn than such a meeting?<a name=208:10></a> God, in the presence of men, to be rejected, and that for ever and ever!<a name=208:11></a>

		It may be useful here to notice some details: the Lord begins by announcing Himself, personally and distinctly, as the light of the world.<a name=209:1></a> In John, it is always a question of the world; also, it is not a question of the Messiah according to the promises, but of what the Lord is in Himself, of what He is, He only, in the midst of the darkness.<a name=209:2></a> In following Him, one would have the light of life; for the life was the light of men.<a name=209:3></a> We see how this chapter reproduces that which is said in chapter 1; only here it brings out historically the contrast and the conflict between the light and the darkness, for the world was in it, and Satan was the prince of the world.<a name=209:4></a> The Lord having thus announced Himself as light (and light manifests itself, and manifests everything), His testimony is rejected, as being that of a Man who bore witness of Himself (verse 13).<a name=209:5></a> They do not see the light, they reject it; that which is divine is hidden, although it is light.<a name=209:6></a> He was the light, and His words were the expression of what He was; but He had not come to judge, as the case of the woman shewed, however just His judgment would have been, for the Father was with Him.<a name=209:7></a> But the law was their law; then Jesus was the revelation of God Himself in that which He was as light: it was Himself and the word of testimony, the Father being with Him.<a name=209:8></a> If that were rejected, it was not disobedience to a commandment, but the rejection of divine life and light, so that those who rendered themselves guilty of it should die in their sins.<a name=209:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		All chapter 8 is the expression of the divine light by the testimony of the Lord; but the chapter treats of more than one subject, where this testimony is given in more than one aspect.<a name=209:10></a> The first part is to be found from verse 12 to 20, which present the position in itself: the Lord is the divine light; He is not come to judge, but the Father is with Him; God and the truth are presented to men; He is rejected by the darkness of man's heart, but His hour is not yet come.<a name=209:11></a> Then (verse 21-29) He goes away.<a name=209:12></a> In John His death is never what is spoken of, but He goes away, and the Jews would know when He had been lifted up as Son of man, that it was He; it would then be too late to find Him again.<a name=209:13></a> After that (verse 30), many having believed in Him, He announces to them what their position should be, if they persevered; the Son would make them free, and they would be free indeed; this in contrast with the Jews.<a name=209:14></a> There was a complete change of position.<a name=209:15></a> Man committed sin -- he was the slave of it: the Jews, no doubt, were in God's house, but by the law as slaves; for to be under the law, and to commit sin, is the same thing.<a name=209:16></a> The Jews, therefore, had no sure place in the house; and they would even lose the one which they had: but Christ then would have His place as Son over God's house, and those who believed in Him, who persevered in His word, made free by Him, should possess true divine liberty.<a name=209:17></a> As to the promises, they were indeed, according to the flesh, the seed of Abraham; but they were not sons of Abraham according to God.<a name=209:18></a> Being come personally as light, the Lord would have what is true, not merely dispensations; they were, in reality, sons of him who was a murderer and a liar; they were rejecting the truth, they were going to put Christ to death, and did not believe Him, because He spoke the truth.<a name=209:19></a> Finally, for He was the life as well as the truth, he who should keep His word, would never taste death (verse 51); He was not only the light, but the light of life.<a name=209:20></a> Besides, not only was He the object of the promises which Abraham's faith had realised, but He existed with an eternal existence, God -- "I am," before Abraham was.<a name=209:21></a> Then the hatred of unbelief burst out.<a name=209:22></a> Before, they had maliciously sought to turn away the truth, and to justify themselves before one another in rejecting Him, but as soon as what He was is fully revealed, their murderous hatred shews itself by violence.<a name=209:23></a>

		In the eighth chapter we had the testimony given, the divine word of the Saviour: the ninth chapter relates to the testimony of His works.<a name=210:1></a> The Lord sets aside the entire governmental system of the Jews; He speaks, too, of Himself as being only a little longer of this world; but so long as He was, He must do the works of His Father who had sent Him, for although He was God present in this world, He always takes the place of a Man subject to God, and He does so specially in John's Gospel, where His Person is set in relief.<a name=210:2></a> It is this position Satan sought to get Him out of, in the temptation in the wilderness, a position in which He remained firm and perfect.<a name=210:3></a> He is always the sent One, although He be Son of God, and one with the Father.<a name=210:4></a>

		Crossing this poor world, the Lord meets with one born blind, a picture of man, and specially of the Jews.<a name=211:1></a> Here He is truly the light of the world, while announcing, as I have just said, that He was going to leave the world.<a name=211:2></a> But there is more; He works in grace, He gives life.<a name=211:3></a> Not only is He the light of the world as long as He is in it, for this is only for a time; but He is powerful in grace to give the capacity of enjoying the light.<a name=211:4></a> Nevertheless, although it be divine power that communicates it, He must be received as the sent One of the Father; He never leaves His position.<a name=211:5></a> His presence, without His work, only blinds the more, at least presents an outward difficulty; He is a stone of stumbling.<a name=211:6></a> The spittle (verse 6) presents the efficacy which came from Himself; the earth, the humanity which He had taken.<a name=211:7></a> But that, in itself alone, only made the blind man doubly blind: a positive obstacle was added to natural blindness: but it was necessary that this object should be before his eyes.<a name=211:8></a> Jesus sends the poor man to the pool of Siloam.<a name=211:9></a> The text itself gives the meaning of this word: it signifies "Sent.<a name=211:10></a>" The moment this truth is connected with the Person of Jesus, in the blind man, all is accomplished; the man sees clearly, with a clearness which is according to the power of God: "I washed, and I see" (verse 11).<a name=211:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the eighth chapter it was a question of man's responsibility, a responsibility connected with the testimony of the word of God: here it is its powerful efficacy to give sight to the blind man, in revealing the Son sent by the Father.<a name=211:12></a> Man's folly, his religious blindness, are made manifest: for him, Jesus was not of God, because, although He did works of power and of divine goodness, He did not keep the sabbath.<a name=211:13></a> Now, the sabbath was the sign of God's covenant with Israel, the sign of the rest of God.<a name=211:14></a> But in Jesus, God was there, and the Son of man was Lord of the sabbath, and the rest of God was not for those who rejected Him.<a name=211:15></a> Further, this rest became heavenly at that moment.<a name=211:16></a>

		What is striking in this passage is the perplexity of religious people, and they instructed in their religion, characterised by the elements of this world, when they are in the presence of divine power.<a name=211:17></a> "He does not keep the sabbath!<a name=211:18></a>" What a subterfuge!<a name=211:19></a> Others said, "How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles?<a name=211:20></a>" The evidence was too strong: there was a division among them.<a name=211:21></a> Then they would not believe that the man had been born blind, until they had called his parents.<a name=211:22></a> These feared to compromise themselves, but bear the only testimony that it was of consequence to hear from them, that is, that the man was really their son, and that he was born blind.<a name=211:23></a> The Jews call back the man himself for the second time, and seek to cover up the whole question by their religious authority.<a name=211:24></a> They are quite willing to recognise the fact that the man had been blind, and that now he saw, and they invite him to give glory to God for that; but, as to owning the truth and the Son of God, they will not do that; it is with them a foregone conclusion.<a name=211:25></a> The poor man is indignant at their blindness, wise as they were, and guardians of their religion, for he had personally experienced the powerful efficacy of the word of Jesus.<a name=211:26></a> His testimony is clear and simple: "he is a prophet," and taught of God, he does not understand how the Jews can hesitate to receive the brilliant proof of it, that was there before their eyes; for simple faith, that had experienced the power of God, does not understand the difficulties which religious learning opposes to it, when will does not want the truth and Jesus.<a name=211:27></a> This man did not know what governed the hearts of those who were questioning him; but, as for them, they well knew that they were resisting the light of divine power.<a name=211:28></a> Disgusted at his bold frankness, which wonders at their unbelief, they arrive exactly at the conclusion that the Lord had condemned; that is, that the man's blindness was the effect of his sin: and they cast him out.<a name=211:29></a>

		In the first place, all those who, before Him, had pretended to be the shepherds and leaders of Israel; all those, whoever they might be, who did not enter by the door, were thieves and robbers, climbing over the wall, forcing an entrance by violence or cunning; thus they betrayed their true character.<a name=214:2></a> The sheepfold was Israel.<a name=214:3></a> These men sought to get possession of the sheep for their own profit, for their own glory: they were neither Messiahs, nor servants of God, nor sent by Him, very far from being one with the Father.<a name=214:4></a> I say this in order to establish the Lord's position more distinctly.<a name=214:5></a> The second verse presents to us this position in its first features: "He who enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.<a name=214:6></a>" He entered in by the door; He came by the way chosen by Him who had established the sheepfold, there, where the porter was; he who could open the door, or keep it shut; thus He attracted the attention of him who was the keeper of the fold.<a name=214:7></a>

		The first mark that characterises the sheep of Jesus, and that we so often find here, is, that they listen to His voice (verse 27, see verse 3, 4, 5, 16); then come two other marks which belong to them: the Good Shepherd knows them (compare verse 14, and for the sense, verse 3), and they follow Him.<a name=220:9></a> (Compare verse 4.<a name=220:10></a>) Then the Lord declares plainly to us what He gives them; that is, eternal life, in the full assurance of the faithfulness of Christ, and of the power of the Father Himself.<a name=220:11></a> Already had He declared that His object in coming was, in grace, to give life, and life in abundance; not to seek booty, like a robber, but to give life from above, in grace.<a name=220:12></a> We have here the nature and character of this life, in grace: it was eternal life, that life of which Christ was the source and representative in humanity (compare 1 John 1: 2, and also John 1: 4), that life which was essentially in the Father Himself, which was in the Person of the Son down here, the life that God gives us in Him (1 John 5: 11, 12), and by Him, which we possess in Him; for He is our life (Colossians 3: 4; Galatians 2: 20); which bears the impress of Christ, new position of man, according to the counsels of God.<a name=220:13></a> For us -- first character of this life, for we were dead in our trespasses and sins, and under the power of death -- down here -- Christ is, then, the resurrection and the life, a life which ought to manifest itself in us now, and which breathes, so to speak, by faith in Him (Galatians 2: 20; 2 Corinthians 4: 10-18), and will be fully developed when we shall be with Him, and glorified (Romans 6: 22), but which subsists in the knowledge of the Father, the only true God, and of Jesus Christ whom He has sent.<a name=220:14></a> (John 17: 2, 3; see 1 John 5: 20.<a name=220:15></a>) It is the gift of God, but it is real and moral: we are born of water and of the Spirit.<a name=220:16></a> (John 3: 5, 6.<a name=220:17></a>) Of His own will He hath begotten us by the word of truth (James 1: 18).<a name=220:18></a> Thus it is that that which was in Christ reproduces itself in us, according to the word which is the expression of it.<a name=220:19></a> (1 John 2: <i>5-</i>8; chapter 1: 1; 1 Peter 1: 21 -- 25.<a name=220:20></a>) This word nourishes the life (1 Peter 2: 2), and thus we can say of this life, or rather the Lord says it: "Because I live, ye shall live also" (John 14: 19).<a name=220:21></a> Here it is the life itself; but to complete the character of this life in the Christian, we must add, "the "Spirit of life": then that becomes "the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus" (Romans 8: 2); then, according to John 4, with heavenly objects before it, it is a source of living water springing up into everlasting life.<a name=220:22></a>

		Lazarus, a member of a family beloved of Jesus, was sick.<a name=223:7></a> Jesus Himself, away from Jerusalem, had withdrawn to the side of Jordan.<a name=223:8></a> The sisters of Lazarus, one of whom, when He frequented the house, had remained sitting at His feet to hear Him, whilst the other was preoccupied with household service, and had complained that she was left alone, sent to tell the Lord that their brother was sick.<a name=223:9></a> Jesus answered: "This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified thereby" (verse 4); after this, He remained two days in the place where He was; then He said to His disciples, "Let us go into Judea again.<a name=223:10></a>" The disciples raise the objection that the Jews, a little before, had sought to kill Him.<a name=223:11></a> The answer of the Lord reveals to us the principle which governed all His conduct.<a name=223:12></a> During these two days He had received no direction from His Father to go to Bethany, and, in spite of the affection He had for this family, of which He was reminded by the two sisters, He remains there where He was, without stirring.<a name=223:13></a> Then, His Father's will being revealed to Him, He goes away without hesitation to the place of danger He had left.<a name=223:14></a> The light of day was on His path, the light of His Father's will.<a name=223:15></a> There He always walked.<a name=223:16></a>

		After this, Jesus said to His disciples, "Lazarus, our friend, is fallen asleep; but I go that I may awake him out of sleep" (verse 11).<a name=224:1></a> Jesus spoke thus, because death took this character in His eyes, the power of resurrection and of life being in Him.<a name=224:2></a> The apostles apply His words literally to natural sleep, upon which He explains them to them.<a name=224:3></a> How many things passed in the heart of Jesus which did not come out!<a name=224:4></a> For His walk, the will of His Father was enough, and He had the discernment of that will.<a name=224:5></a> But His own death was before His eyes, the dominion of death over man, the power of life in Himself, the glory of God manifested in the exercise of this, the fact that He was the Son of God in whom the resurrection and the life had come, the ways of God that brought Him back there, where, in effect, death awaited Him, the affection of the family of the deceased man, which, real as it was, did not for a moment set aside His waiting upon the will of God, His isolation -- for His disciples did not understand Him -- all the immense consequences of this journey, where the dominion of death over man, the presence of the Resurrection and the Life, the subjection to death of Him who was both one and the other, and that for man -- all this weighed upon the Saviour's spirit, His spirit alone in the midst of the world!<a name=224:6></a> But for Him, I repeat, His Father's will was sufficient to light His path; He needed but this.<a name=224:7></a> Invaluable teaching for us, and for our feeble hearts, but which have divine power with them in that path.<a name=224:8></a> One does not stumble there.<a name=224:9></a> The precious Saviour never failed in it, either in life or in death; He led a hidden life with His Father, a life which shewed itself in obedience and perfect love for Him, but which made up His life where hatred and death reigned, these, however, only leading Him to the end He was pursuing, namely, perfect obedience to, and the absolute glory of, His Father.<a name=224:10></a> Oh!<a name=224:11></a> may we be able to follow Him; and, if it be afar off, at least may it be Him that we follow while walking in His footsteps, in the inner life which looks to Him, and in obedience, and seeking what He wills!<a name=224:12></a>

		"Let us go to him," said Jesus (verse 15).<a name=224:13></a> He goes to meet death as a power that exercises its dominion over man; and to undergo it Himself, He who was the Resurrection and the Life, in view of our salvation, and for the glory of God.<a name=224:14></a> In His walk of obedience down here, the Father always hears Him, and He exercises thus divine power, even to raising a dead man; but He walks in this path of obedience to obey to the end, finding that He could not be heard until the cup, of which He had a holy fear, had been drunk; that cup that He was going to drink, in being abandoned of God in His soul, then heard, doubtless, and glorified, but after having experienced to the end what it was not to be heard.<a name=224:15></a>

		The news of the arrival of Jesus reached Bethany, and Martha heard of it, and arose immediately and went to meet the Lord (verse 19, 20).<a name=226:1></a> Martha's heart was governed by circumstances, and the tardy arrival of the Lord sets her at once in action.<a name=226:2></a> What would Jesus say?<a name=226:3></a> What would He do?<a name=226:4></a> There was with Martha confidence in Him, but nothing was weighed.<a name=226:5></a> Mary was more serious; she was accustomed to sit at the feet of Jesus, to listen to the divine testimony that issued from His mouth; there was, perhaps, more perplexity in her heart as to why the Lord had not come earlier, but with more reverence for His Person, she was more influenced by the sense of His divine character; she remains quietly in the house waiting until God ordered for her that she should be found with Jesus; her heart full, ready to burst forth, still counted upon Jesus and relied on Him, cast down I have no doubt, but knowing that there was in the Lord a heart more deep, more full of love than her own.<a name=226:6></a> Martha, having come to Jesus, is quite ready with a word; she recognises Him truly as Lord, she believes in Him truly, but with a faith that knows little what He is.<a name=226:7></a> "Lord, if thou hadst been here," she says, "my brother would not have died," but still she knew that as Messiah, what Jesus asked of God, God would give Him.<a name=226:8></a> It is not here a question of the Father, of the Son who had life in Himself; but Martha had known too well what Jesus had done to suppose that God would not hear Him.<a name=226:9></a> All this passage is interesting, for it shews us a soul that believed in Jesus, a soul that loved Him, but a faith -- one sees many thus -- where all was vague, a faith that recognised in Jesus a Mediator, whom God would hear, but that knew nothing of His Person as come into this world, nor of the quickening power which was found in the Son of God, come into the midst of the scene where death reigned.<a name=226:10></a> The Lord's answer raises this question and gives room for the public testimony of God on this subject.<a name=226:11></a> "Thy brother shall rise again," said Jesus.<a name=226:12></a> Martha, an orthodox Pharisee, answers, "I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day"; she might have said as much of the greatest enemies of Christ.<a name=226:13></a> These will certainly rise again, the power of God will effect it.<a name=226:14></a> Martha's answer did not say more of it, did not say one word of what the Saviour was.<a name=226:15></a> Jesus says, "I am the resurrection and the life" (verse 25).<a name=226:16></a> As in the whole Gospel, we have here what Jesus is as light and life, in His Person, as come into the world, in contrast with all the promises made to the Jews, even though they had been justly appreciated.<a name=226:17></a> They were scarcely so here, they were at least in a very vague manner.<a name=226:18></a>

		The Lord speaks here (verse 25, 26) as already present to accomplish the great result of His power, still hidden in His Person, but of which He was going to give the proof in the resurrection of Lazarus.<a name=227:1></a> When He shall exercise this power, he that believeth<a href="#227:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> in Him, even though he be dead, shall live; and whosoever liveth, and believeth in Him, shall never die.<a name=227:2></a> Power is in His Person; the present proof of it was found in the resurrection of Lazarus; the accomplishment of it will be when He shall come back to exercise this power in its fulness.<a name=227:3></a> In the meantime the thing is realised according to the place that Christ has taken; He raised up Lazarus for life in this world where He was.<a name=227:4></a> Now that He is absent, the soul that is quickened by His power goes to Him where He is; when He comes back, He will raise the believing dead in glory; believers who are alive will not die.<a name=227:5></a> Evidently we find in this the power of life that is in the Person of the Saviour, in contrast with Martha's vague thought, so common among Christians, too, that God will raise up all men at the end of time.<a name=227:6></a> The words of the Lord apply only to believers.<a name=227:7></a>

		Before going further, I wish to draw attention once more to this solemn bringing together of the power of death over man's heart, over the first Adam, and the power of divine life in the Son of God, present in a man in the very heart of the dominion of death, destroying this dominion, and He who possessed it in His Person, giving Himself up to death, in order to deliver from it those that were subject to it.<a name=233:4></a> That Jesus had this in view is apparent: (See chapter 10: 31, 40; chapter 11: 16, 53, 54; chapter 12: 7.<a name=233:5></a>) He had it on His spirit when He came back to Jerusalem, and when He spoke with Martha and Mary; He must Himself undergo death for us.<a name=233:6></a>

		The next day (verse 12, etc.<a name=233:7></a>) the people, having learned that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, struck by this great miracle of the resurrection of Lazarus, go forth to meet Him with branches of palm-trees, and salute Him as the King of Israel that cometh in the name of Jehovah, according to Psalm 118.<a name=233:8></a> It is the second character in which God would have Jesus recognised, notwithstanding His rejection.<a name=233:9></a> The resurrection of Lazarus had shewn Him as Son of God; now He is owned Son of David.<a name=233:10></a> Here the event is in direct connection with the resurrection of Lazarus, and the title of Son of God; in Luke, and even in Matthew and Mark, this circumstance is connected rather with the title of Lord, and we find there the details of the manner in which Jesus found the ass's colt.<a name=233:11></a> In these three Gospels too, although this difference is less striking in Matthew, the disciples are put forward, whilst here it is more the people, moved by the noise which the resurrection of Lazarus had caused.<a name=233:12></a> It is the prophecy of Zechariah, but leaving out that which, in the prophet, refers to the deliverance of Israel.<a name=233:13></a> John and Matthew mention it, for it was only after that Jesus was glorified, that the disciples could connect the prophecy with that which they had themselves done to honour Him, and to cause Him to enter in triumph into Jerusalem, Jesus, however, having given the order about the ass's colt.<a name=233:14></a>

		After this the Greeks, from amongst those who had gone up to worship during the feast, arrive and desire to see Jesus.<a name=234:2></a> They come to Philip, who tells Andrew, and then Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.<a name=234:3></a> Although coming to worship at Jerusalem, they were strangers to the covenants of promise; an entirely new order of things was needed to introduce them into it.<a name=234:4></a> They had no right to the promises; Jesus must die to lay the foundation for this new order of things.<a name=234:5></a> Jesus is here, not the promised Messiah, but the second Man, head of all things that God had created, that He had Himself created: but He must receive them by redemption, and especially His co-heirs.<a name=234:6></a> "Except a grain of wheat fall into the ground and die, it remains alone; but if it die, it bears much fruit" (verse 24).<a name=234:7></a> He must redeem the co-heirs in order to have them with Himself.<a name=234:8></a> If He were King of Israel and Son of God according to Psalm 2, He was, as Son of man, Lord of the whole creation; only He must die that His co-heirs should have part in the inheritance that He had acquired.<a name=234:9></a> "The hour is come," said He, "that the Son of man should be glorified" (verse 23).<a name=234:10></a>

		It is well to remember the testimonies that the Old and New Testament furnish on the bearing of this title of <i>Son of Man</i>.<a name=234:11></a> The Psalms and Daniel speak of it.<a name=234:12></a> We find it in Psalm 80: 17, where the point is, the blessing of the Jews, when they will return to Jehovah; in Psalm 8, after having been rejected in Psalm 2 as Son of God and King of Israel, the Son of man appears as Lord of all; it is still here, when the name of Jehovah, the God of the Jews, is "excellent in all the earth," but His glory exalted also above the heavens, that Man, at the same time the Son of man, is set over all the works of God.<a name=234:13></a> This Psalm 8 is quoted by the Lord to justify the cries of the children when He entered into Jerusalem (verse 2); and by the apostle Paul (Ephesians 1: 21, 22; 1 Corinthians 15: 27), in view of Christ's position as Head over all after His resurrection; and in Hebrews 2, to shew His glory in this position above angels (chapter 1 of this epistle having presented this position as a consequence of His divinity), but when this human supremacy had not yet taken place, although He was crowned with glory and honour.<a name=234:14></a> These three passages develop clearly the position of Jesus as Son of man; one other (Daniel 7: 13, 14) completes the picture of the place of the Son of man in the government of God.<a name=234:15></a> In this passage the Son of man is brought to the Ancient of Days in order to take up the government, not of the Jews only, but of all kingdoms, exercising from on high, from heaven, the universal dominion of which He holds the reins, by it replacing all the powers that have held a more or less universal sway after that the throne of God had left Jerusalem on the Babylonish captivity.<a name=234:16></a>

		Now to take this position of dominion not only over Israel and over the nations, but over all the works of God, over all that He Himself had created, Jesus must die, not to have right to everything, but to possess on the ground of redemption, all things reconciled to God, and then to have co-heirs, according to the counsels of God, He being the Firstborn among many brethren.<a name=235:1></a> This death is the first thought that comes to the mind of the Lord when the arrival of the Greeks brings forward His dignity as Son of man.<a name=235:2></a> Death and the curse were man's inheritance; Jesus must undergo them, to raise man from the state in which he was found, and to place him in the lordship which had been destined for him according to the counsels of God.<a name=235:3></a> He was the second Man, the last Adam; but sin having entered into the world, He must redeem the co-heirs, purify them, that they might have a place with Him; He must take away all right from the enemy, so as to deprive him later on of his power over the heritage that he had acquired by man's sin, and even by the judgment of God, and to reconcile all things to God having made peace by the blood of the cross.<a name=235:4></a> In this path of death, for it was indeed the death of the cross, if any one serve Him, he must follow Him.<a name=235:5></a> Whosoever loves his life shall lose it, and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.<a name=235:6></a> Solemn word!<a name=235:7></a> But we have already seen that His rejection must, according to Psalm 2, be associated with His character of Messiah and Son of God: He should be no more of this world.<a name=235:8></a> His position as Son of man, Head over all things, only comes afterwards in Psalm 8.<a name=235:9></a>

		From the tenth chapter, we find ourselves historically in the shadow of His death, which made thus an absolute breach between Him and the world, and was also death in all its terror as the judgment of God.<a name=236:1></a> He has borne the judgment in our place; but it was there the judgment of a world that should see Him no more.<a name=236:2></a> The friendship of the world henceforth would be enmity against God; it had been always so in reality, but now the fact was publicly manifested; it is the rejected Lord who is the Saviour.<a name=236:3></a> It is He whom man has crucified, that God has raised to His right hand.<a name=236:4></a> He had fully revealed the Father, and they had seen and hated both Him and the Father, as He says (chapter 15: 24), and in appealing to the judgment of God, "Righteous Father, the world hath not known thee.<a name=236:5></a>" To be a Saviour, He had to be lifted up from the earth; the Son of man had to suffer and die; a living Christ was for the Jews.<a name=236:6></a> The shadow of death only grew thicker up to Gethsemane, where its deepest shades enveloped the soul of Jesus, and where He took in His hand the cup which contained that which had thrown its shadow on His soul all along the way, but which now penetrated it with its most profound darkness.<a name=236:7></a> One only thing remained to Him up to the cross, and even in the sufferings of perfect obedience -- communion with His Father; at the cross, obedience was accomplished, and the communion was lost, to make His obedience and His perfection shine the more.<a name=236:8></a> It was man's hour and the power of darkness which only drove Him on towards the judgment of God, more terrible than the subordinate instruments that darkened the path of obedience and of sufferings, in which He perfectly glorified God, there where He has been made sin for us, and has blotted out our sins for ever.<a name=236:9></a>

		The Lord speaks in an abstract way, as of a rule or principle, the ground of which He Himself was going to lay for all; only He was giving Himself that others might have eternal life; and He could have delivered Himself, or have obtained twelve legions of angels; but then, how would the scriptures have been fulfilled?<a name=237:1></a> The thing could not be; He had not come to deliver Himself.<a name=237:2></a> He would have remained in heaven, and have left us exposed to God's righteous judgment; but that could not be either: His love did not allow Him to do this.<a name=237:3></a> He had also too much at heart the accomplishment of the counsels of God, and the glory of God His Father, which should thus be made evident in a remarkable and perfect manner.<a name=237:4></a> The Saviour's rejection on the part of the world has been the rejection of the world on the part of God.<a name=237:5></a> The last effort to find or arouse good in man's heart had been made, and they had "seen and hated both me and my Father.<a name=237:6></a>" God could save out of this world, in grace; but the world was lost, it was in a state of enmity against God.<a name=237:7></a> He therefore who attaches himself to this world, who seeks his life in it, or who keeps it as a life to which he clings, in contrast with the rejected Christ, loses it.<a name=237:8></a> We are not always called upon to sacrifice our lives outwardly, although this might take place, and has often happened; but morally this applies always: he who loves his life, who cleaves to it as if it belonged to this world, loses it.<a name=237:9></a> It is a life of vanity, alienated from God as the world itself to which it attaches itself, a life which ends only in death; for here Jesus does not speak of judgment.<a name=237:10></a>

		The Lord adds, to that which precedes, a most important principle of conduct: "If any man serve me, let him <i>follow</i> me" (verse 26).<a name=237:11></a> It will be in principle, through death, that we must follow Him -- death to sin and to the world; but the consequence of such a path is simple; where the Saviour is, there shall His servant be.<a name=237:12></a> Such an one follows Him through death into the heavenly glory where He has entered, and "If any man serve me, him will my Father honour.<a name=237:13></a>"

		But the heart of the Lord, if He exhorted others to take the narrow road in which one was to deny oneself, and the world that was enmity against God, whilst losing a life identified with the world which rejected the light when it had come into it in grace -- His heart, I say, realised what was before Himself, for He was going to meet death, death armed with its sting -- the judgment of God against sin, and the power of Satan -- but a death in which we find all the more the perfection of Jesus.<a name=237:14></a> "Now," He says, "is my soul troubled; and what shall I say?<a name=237:15></a> Father, save me from this hour; but for this cause came I unto this hour"; it was for this that I came into the world.<a name=237:16></a> Then the Saviour goes back to the true motive of everything, a motive always present to His heart: "Father, glorify thy name!<a name=237:17></a>" Cost what it might, this was what He desired always.<a name=237:18></a> There was no delay in the answer of the Father: "I have both glorified it, and I will glorify it again.<a name=237:19></a>" I have no doubt that this "I will glorify it again" was to be accomplished in resurrection.<a name=237:20></a> The Father had glorified His name in the resurrection of Lazarus, a resurrection in this world; He was going to do it again in Christ Himself, in a better resurrection, a true answer to death, where the sovereign power of God in grace, and towards Christ in righteousness, has been manifested; a new state in which man had never been, but which was, according to God's counsels, the expression of what He is in Himself, and perfect blessing for man: "Christ (says the apostle) was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father.<a name=237:21></a>"

		The multitude did not know what to think of this voice that it had heard; they said it was a clap of thunder; others, that an angel had spoken to Him.<a name=238:1></a> Jesus answers: "This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes"; the Father's voice was in His heart; for the people, it was necessary to have that which was sensible; grace gave it to them.<a name=238:2></a> But the Lord explains this solemn sign, by that which was in His heart, and that He knew to be taking place at that moment: "Now is the judgment of this world.<a name=238:3></a>" Then, indeed, took place the judgment of the world, which is condemned absolutely and finally in rejecting the Lord; but in this also is accomplished the work that has broken for ever the power of Satan, prince of this world; and, on the other hand, a Saviour has been manifested, point of attraction for all men, instead and in place of a Messiah of the Jews, for these things He said to signify by what death He should die.<a name=238:4></a> The multitude (verse 34) oppose to Him that which was written of the Messiah, and ask: "How sayest thou that the Son of man must be lifted up [from the earth]?<a name=238:5></a> Who is this Son of man?<a name=238:6></a>" The Lord answers by warning them that the moment was approaching when the light, He Himself, would be put out for them, and when they would lose it for ever: they would walk in darkness, not knowing whither they went; for them, wisdom was to believe in the light before it went away, that they might be sons of light; then He went away.<a name=238:7></a>

		The rest of the chapter is a summing up of the position.<a name=239:5></a> In the first part, it is the evangelist who records the obstinate incredulity of the people, and the sad motives that governed their minds, preoccupied with the approbation of men, rather than looking to God.<a name=239:6></a> In the second part, Jesus Himself shews two things; first of all, that in rejecting Him thus, those that did it, rejected the light itself, come into the world, that those who believed on God should not remain in darkness; then, that in rejecting Him, they rejected the Father, for what He said were the Father's words.<a name=239:7></a> Thus He did not judge him that heard His word, but did not keep it, for He was not come to judge the world, but to save it; His words would judge them at the last day.<a name=239:8></a> Now, that which He said was the Father's commandment, and this commandment (He knew it, He had faith in it, the certain consciousness in Himself) was eternal life.<a name=239:9></a> All that He said then, He "spoke" it, as the Father had spoken to Him.<a name=239:10></a>

		In chapter 13 the instructions begin that relate to a heavenly Saviour.<a name=240:1></a> Although He was upon earth, He was the Light come from heaven, the eternal life that was from heaven; but, rejected upon earth, He now takes His place in heaven -- not God manifested in human humiliation down here, but Man glorified in the glory of God above; and He exhibits and develops what He is for us in this position, before entering into it.<a name=240:2></a>

		From this thirteenth chapter, then, the Saviour presents Himself as having finished His testimony upon earth, and going to the Father.<a name=240:3></a> This leads Him to speak of His position and of His service on high in heaven, of the position of the disciples, and of the other Comforter, that He -- and the Father in His name -- would send from on high.<a name=240:4></a> He was seated at supper with His disciples, their friend and companion at table down here, one of them, whatever might be His glory, and their servant in grace.<a name=240:5></a> But He must leave them and go to His Father; solemn moment for them: what would become of them, and what would be their relationship with Him?<a name=240:6></a> Their thoughts hardly went further than this with regard to Him; they thought that they had found the Messiah who was going to set up the kingdom of God in Israel, although the Holy Ghost had attached them to His Person by a divine power.<a name=240:7></a> They knew that He was the Son of the living God, He who had the words of eternal life.<a name=240:8></a> But He was going to leave them: He had been among them as one who serves; must His service of love come to an end?<a name=240:9></a> The Father had given all things into His hands, He knew it; He was come from God, and was going to God; could the link of His service of love with His own continue?<a name=240:10></a> If it should, it was necessary that they should be fit for the presence of God Himself, and for association with the One to whom all things were committed.<a name=240:11></a>

		It will be well to notice here the difference that there is between the Priest and the Advocate.<a name=242:5></a> In practice the difference is important.<a name=242:6></a> Both offices have to do with intercession; but the Advocate is for sins that have been committed; the Priest is there that we may not sin, and that goodness may be in exercise in respect of our weakness; I speak of the Priesthood in heaven.<a name=242:7></a> Upon the cross Jesus was Priest and Victim (the goat Hazazel); but there the priest <i>represented</i> all the people, confessing their sins on the goat's head.<a name=242:8></a> This was indeed the work of the priest, but not properly a priestly act; and, as I have just said, the priest acted there as the representative of all the people, these latter being looked upon as guilty.<a name=242:9></a> This work is accomplished by the offering of the body of Jesus Christ, made once for all: by His one offering He has perfected for ever those that are sanctified, so that we have no more conscience of sins.<a name=242:10></a> But Christ intercedes for us, in order that we may obtain mercy, and that we may find grace in time of need; so that, in our weakness, we may be the objects of the care of God's goodness, and that we may not sin.<a name=242:11></a> The Advocate intercedes, when we have sinned, to re-establish the interrupted communion, for it is a question of communion in 1 John 1.<a name=242:12></a> Righteousness and propitiation remain always perfect, and form the basis of that which is done for us when we have failed; 1 John 2: 1, 2.<a name=242:13></a> The effect of this grace in Christ is, that the Spirit applies the word (the water in figure), humbles us in convincing us of sin, and brings us near to God.<a name=242:14></a> The red heifer (Numbers 19) is a very instructive development of this renewing of communion.<a name=242:15></a> Notice here, that the Advocate does His work in order that we may be cleansed, not when we have been: also, we do not go to Him that He may do it; it is He who takes the initiative in grace, as He did for Peter, that His disciple's faith might not fail, when He should be obliged to leave him to himself for a moment, that he should make experience of his weakness.<a name=242:16></a>

		The Lord, in speaking here to His disciples, makes an exception of Judas, for He knew that Judas should betray Him, and He warns the disciples of it, that it might not be a stumbling-block.<a name=243:9></a> Still, in receiving one sent of the Lord, as sent of Him, they received Him; and in receiving Him, they received the Father Himself that sent Him.<a name=243:10></a> But although the Lord knew who should betray Him, the feeling that it was one of His own companions grieved Him; He even opens His heart before them: "One of you shall betray me.<a name=243:11></a>" (verse 21).<a name=243:12></a> Sure at least of the truth of His words, of the certainty of them, they look at one another with the sincerity of innocence.<a name=243:13></a> Now John was near the Lord; Peter, always ardent, wishes to know who it is, and makes a sign to John to ask Jesus, for he was not himself near enough to Him to ask the question.<a name=243:14></a> Peter loved the Lord, a sincere faith attached him to Him, but he lacked that concentration of spirit that would have kept him near the Lord, as Mary, the sister of Martha, was kept there.<a name=243:15></a> John had not placed himself near Jesus to receive this communication; he received it because, according to the habit of his heart, he kept near Him, glorying in the title, "the disciple whom Jesus loved.<a name=243:16></a>" Thus John was there where he could receive the Lord's communication.<a name=243:17></a> This is our secret, too, in order to have the intimate communications of the Lord.<a name=243:18></a> Blessed place, where the heart enjoys the affections of the Saviour, and where He communicates to us what His heart contains for those whom He loves.<a name=243:19></a>

		But nearness to Jesus, without faith in Him, if the heart overcomes the influence of His presence, hardens in a terrible manner; the morsel which shewed that one was eating of the same dish, the morsel which Judas received, dipped by His hand, is but the sign of Satan's entering into his heart.<a name=244:1></a> Satan enters into this heart to harden it, even against every amiable sentiment of nature, against every remembrance of that which could act upon the conscience.<a name=244:2></a> There are many unconverted persons, who would not betray an intimate companion by covering him with kisses; many wicked people that would have remembered the miracles they had seen -- perhaps done themselves.<a name=244:3></a> Covetousness had been there, it had never been repressed; then Satan suggests to Judas the means of satisfying it.<a name=244:4></a> For myself I have no doubt that Iscariot thought that the Lord would escape out of the hands of men, as He had done, when His hour was not yet come: his remorse, when he knew that Jesus was condemned, makes me think it -- a remorse which only found other hearts as hard as his own, and indifferent to his misery; an appalling picture of man's heart under the influence of Satan.<a name=244:5></a> Then, almost the final phase of this influence, Satan hardens Judas against all feeling of humanity, and of man towards the man of his acquaintance, and finishes all by abandoning him, giving him up to despair in the presence of God.<a name=244:6></a>

		Morally all was over when Judas had taken the morsel that had been dipped: and Jesus charges him to do quickly that which he was doing.<a name=245:1></a> The disciples did not know why the Lord said this; they thought of the feast, or of the use which might be made of what was in the purse; but in the heart of the Lord, all the import of this solemn moment is realised.<a name=245:2></a> As soon as Judas had gone out, He declares it: "Now is the Son of man glorified.<a name=245:3></a>" It is no longer affection, wounded by the treachery of one of His own, that expresses itself in the anguish of His heart; His soul rises, when the fact is there, to the height of the thoughts of God in this solemn event, which stands alone in the history of eternity, and on which all blessing depends, from the beginning, to the new heavens and the new earth.<a name=245:4></a> It rises even above the blessings, to the nature of God, and to the relations of God and of Christ, founded on His glorious work.<a name=245:5></a> This passage is thus of great importance; the cross makes the glory of the Son of man.<a name=245:6></a> He will appear in glory, the Father will subject all things to Him; but it is not this glory that is here in view; it is the Saviour's moral and personal glory.<a name=245:7></a> He who is man, who (although in a miraculous way, so that He was without sin) was, on His mother's side, of the nature of Adam, has been in suffering, the means of establishing and bringing to light all that is found in God, His glory.<a name=245:8></a> God is righteous, holy, and hates sin; God is love: it is impossible to reconcile these characters in any other way, than by the cross.<a name=245:9></a> There, where the righteous judgment of God is in exercise against sin, infinite love is manifested towards the sinner.<a name=245:10></a> Without the cross, it is impossible to reconcile these two things, impossible to manifest God such as He is: in it, holiness, righteousness, love, are manifested as a whole; then obedience and love towards the Father were accomplished in man, in circumstances that put them to the test in an absolute manner.<a name=245:11></a> Nothing was wanting in this test, either on the part of man, of Satan, or of God Himself.<a name=245:12></a> It is in Christ, made sin, that obedience has been perfect; it is in Him, forsaken of God, that His love for God was at its height.<a name=245:13></a> The forsaking of man and his hatred, the power of Satan, had been fully realised, so that when He appealed to God, He found no answer, but that in the solitude of His sufferings, He had the occasion of shewing perfection in man, and of bringing out the glory of God Himself in all that God is, the foundation in righteousness, of the blessing of the new heavens and new earth, in which righteousness dwells -- a righteousness that has already placed the Son of man, in the glory, divine righteousness that cannot but recognise the value of this work, by setting already at His right hand, the Man who has accomplished it, until all shall be manifested in the ages to come.<a name=245:14></a>

		CHAPTER 14
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 14 the Lord presents to His disciples the consolations which were suited to make them accept the revelation He had made to them of His approaching departure.<a name=247:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thing that He declares to them, in His grace, is, that if He was going away, it is not to abandon them, but to prepare them a place elsewhere, that is, in His Father's house.<a name=247:5></a> There, there was not room for Him alone (perhaps He alluded to the temple?<a name=247:6></a>) but abodes for them also; and then He Himself would come for them, so as to have them with Him where He was Himself.<a name=247:7></a> He could not dwell with them down here, but they should be with Him; and He would not send to seek them, but He would come Himself to take them to Himself.<a name=247:8></a> Precious and tender love that associated His own with Himself, according to the place they had in His heart, and according to the eternal counsels of the love of God.<a name=247:9></a> Instead of the kingdom of an earthly Messiah, they would have the eternal and divine glory of the Son of man in heaven, to be like Him, and with Him.<a name=247:10></a> Man having entered there, consequent upon redemption, the place was prepared for them.<a name=247:11></a> It was not a question of preparing them for the place (that is the subject of chapter 13), but of preparing the place for them.<a name=247:12></a> The presence of their Forerunner, where He was going, accomplished it.<a name=247:13></a> The blood made peace according to divine righteousness, the water prepared them to enjoy it.<a name=247:14></a> The entrance of Christ left nothing to be done that they might enter; only the co-heirs must be gathered, and till then, the Lord remains seated on His Father's throne.<a name=247:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The return of the Saviour is therefore the first consolation given them, and it would introduce them, where Jesus was, into the Father's house, being themselves made like Him in glory, instead of His remaining with them down here -- which, moreover, was not possible, since all was defiled, and unfit for the Lord's continuance with His own.<a name=247:16></a> Jesus will come again, and take us to Himself, that where He is, we may be also (verse 1-3).<a name=247:17></a>

		But there was more.<a name=248:1></a> The Lord says, "And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know" (verse 4).<a name=248:2></a> Thomas objects that they did not know where He was going, how therefore could they know the way?<a name=248:3></a> In His answer, Jesus shews them that what they had possessed during His stay upon earth, would furnish an immense blessing when He should have left them.<a name=248:4></a> He was going to the Father, and the Father had been revealed in His Person down here.<a name=248:5></a> Thus, having seen the Father in Him, they had seen Him to whom He was going, and they knew the way, for in coming to Him, they had found the Father.<a name=248:6></a> He was the Way, and, at the same time, the Truth of the thing, and the Life in which it was enjoyed.<a name=248:7></a> No one came to the Father but by Him; if the disciples had known Him, they would have known the Father, and from henceforth said He, "Ye know him, and have seen him" (verse 7).<a name=248:8></a> Philip says, "Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us"; for the disciples, although they were attached to Jesus, always had in themselves a reserve of uncertainty.<a name=248:9></a> The Lord blames Philip for his want of spiritual perception, after His having been so long with them; for they had not really known Him in His true character of Son, come from the Father, and revealing the Father.<a name=248:10></a> The words that He spoke were not as coming from Himself as man; and the Father, who dwelt in Him, was He who did the works; that which He said, that which He did, revealed the Father.<a name=248:11></a> They ought to trust His word, if not, on account of His works; and not only so, but glorified on high He would be the source of greater works than those which He did Himself in His humiliation, for He was going to ascend to His Father.<a name=248:12></a> All that they should ask in His name, He would do it, that the Father might be glorified in the Son.<a name=248:13></a> He was the Son of the Father; His name should avail for all that they could desire in their service; and the Father, to whom He referred everything, would be glorified in the Son, who would do all that they should ask in His name.<a name=248:14></a> His power had no limit: "and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, I will do it.<a name=248:15></a>" In fact, the apostles gave proof of a greater power than the Lord when He was down here.<a name=248:16></a> Peter's shadow healed the sick; one single discourse of his was the means of converting three thousand men, and the napkins, carried to the sick from Paul's body, drove away the sickness from them, and cast out the evil spirits.<a name=248:17></a>

		It is well to remark here, that the disciples never did any miracles to save themselves from suffering, or to heal their friends when they were ill.<a name=249:1></a> Paul left Trophimus sick at Miletus; it was only God's mercy that healed Epaphroditus.<a name=249:2></a> The miracles performed by the apostles were the confirmation of the testimony, of which Christ glorified with the Father was the object and source.<a name=249:3></a>

		In the next place, obedience would be the proof of love when the Lord should be gone away.<a name=249:4></a> This introduces the second principal revelation of this chapter; that is, the effect for them of the presence of the Holy Ghost, the other Comforter.<a name=249:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verses 4-11 had given the revelation of that which Jesus had been for the disciples during His stay upon earth; but the Holy Ghost would teach them more still, and would procure advantages for them that they could not have during the stay of Jesus down here; whilst, at the same time, that which they had possessed by this means, would remain always true, and be understood in quite another manner.<a name=249:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is a difference between these two Comforters.<a name=249:7></a> To begin with, there was no incarnation in connection with the second; the spiritual power of God was in Him, and the power of the truth, but not an object for the soul.<a name=249:8></a> He was characterised as the source of truth and revelation, there where He acted; but He was not presented to the world as an object to be received by it.<a name=249:9></a> The world cannot receive Him.<a name=249:10></a> The world would not receive the Lord, but He had been presented to it to be received, and He had manifested the Father; He could say of those amongst whom He came, "They have both seen and hated both me and my Father.<a name=249:11></a>" As to the Holy Ghost, the world could not receive Him; it did not see Him, neither know Him; He presented the truth, and acted by this means.<a name=249:12></a> But He should be given to believers; they should know Him, for He would dwell with them, and not leave them, as He [Jesus] was doing, and He should be in them.<a name=249:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here also we find the other Comforter, in contrast with the Lord.<a name=249:14></a> Jesus was going away at that moment, then He had been with them; but the other Comforter should be in them.<a name=249:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The presence of the Comforter is the grand present fact of Christianity: its basis is the revelation of the Father in the Son, then the accomplishment of the work of redemption by the Son; but the fact that man in His Person has entered into the divine glory, has given occasion to the descent of the Holy Ghost down here, given to believers to dwell with them and in them, that they may realise the fulness of this redemption, their relationship with the Father, the fact that they are in Christ, and Christ in them, and the heavenly glory where they will be like Him; and that He may lead them across the desert, with spiritual intelligence, and having their conversation in heaven, till they arrive there.<a name=249:16></a> The Spirit also gives us to realise the presence of Jesus with us here below.<a name=249:17></a> Jesus does not leave us orphans; He comes to us, and manifests Himself to us.<a name=249:18></a> Strengthened in our hearts by faith, the joy of His presence makes itself felt to our souls during our pilgrimage below.<a name=249:19></a>

		Soon the world would see Him no more (verse 19); His relations with the world were ended, save as Lord of all, but they were not with His own; they would see Him, not yet with their natural eyes, but by faith, and revealed by the Spirit -- sight far clearer and more excellent than that which their natural eyes had given them.<a name=250:1></a> It was a sight that became identified with the possession of eternal life.<a name=250:2></a> Their eyes had seen Him bodily here, but they would have the sight of Jesus glorified, and who had accomplished the work of redemption, and that by the power of the Holy Ghost, that other Comforter.<a name=250:3></a> The sight of the life of faith identified itself with a real union with Him, so that if He lived, they should live also; He Himself would be their life.<a name=250:4></a> Rather than that they should die, it was necessary that He Himself, such as He is in the glory, should die, and they would have by the presence of the Comforter, the consciousness of being thus in Him.<a name=250:5></a> "In that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.<a name=250:6></a>" The disciples ought to have seen the Father in Him, and to have recognised that He was in the Father during His sojourn upon earth, however little intelligent they might have been.<a name=250:7></a> Now, in that day, when the Holy Spirit should have come, they would know Jesus as being in the Father (the Father in Him is omitted, because it was no longer a question of His manifestation in Him down here).<a name=250:8></a> Thus Jesus would be in the Father in His own deity; but, more, the disciples should know that they themselves were in Him, Jesus, and He in them.<a name=250:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		After that, the Lord establishes, as in all this part of the Gospel, man's responsibility, here that of the Christian, "He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me" (verse 21).<a name=250:10></a> This supposes that we pay attention to what the Lord says: one listens to the voice of divine wisdom, as a child who seeks to please its parents, or a wife her husband, observing the words of the parents or the husband, without even their having the form of a commandment, and knowing what they wish.<a name=250:11></a> Thus the Christian attends to the words of Jesus; he is familiar with that which the Lord wills, and desires to do His will.<a name=250:12></a> This is the proof of true affection.<a name=250:13></a> Now, he who is thus attached in heart to Christ, and obeys Him, shall be loved of the Father, and Christ will come, and will manifest Himself to him.<a name=250:14></a> The manifestation of which He speaks here is a manifestation of Himself, and from Him, to the soul which He causes to realise His presence and makes him sensible of it.<a name=250:15></a> This is what Jude does not understand; he does not perceive how Jesus could be manifested to His own, without being manifested to the world (verse 22).<a name=250:16></a> Alas!<a name=250:17></a> it is just what too many Christians do not understand.<a name=250:18></a> Jude, too, was only thinking of some outward manifestation, of which the world could necessarily take knowledge; but the Lord was speaking of a manifestation such as we have just shewn, adding still something more permanent; that is, that if any one loved Jesus, he would keep, not only His commandments, but His words, so that the Father would love him, and that the Father and Son would come, and make their abode in him (verse 24).<a name=250:19></a>

		We see everywhere here responsibility.<a name=251:1></a> It is not sovereign grace which first loves the poor sinner: here the Father loves the soul which shews its affection for the Saviour in keeping His words.<a name=251:2></a> It is fatherly government, the satisfaction of the Father's heart because the Son is honoured and obeyed.<a name=251:3></a> "If a man love me, he will keep my word," and then -- precious words -- "my Father will love him, and we will make our abode with him.<a name=251:4></a>" The Father and the Son come to dwell in the loved person; and this does not take place merely by the Holy Ghost, as every divine activity; but by the Spirit we enjoy the presence of the Father, and of the Son, their dwelling with us; and the Spirit does not leave us, so that we enjoy constantly in our hearts the presence of the Father and the Son.<a name=251:5></a> The kind of communion, of the realisation of the presence of the Father and the Son, is of all-importance, and gives an ineffable repose and joy.<a name=251:6></a> We shall dwell in the Father's house, and we shall find there the Son in glory; but, till then, the Father and the Son come, and reveal themselves in us, and make their abode in us.<a name=251:7></a> All is done by the Spirit, but it is the presence of the Father and the Son that makes their presence felt in this character of Father and of Son; and the Son is Jesus, who loved us, and gave Himself for us.<a name=251:8></a> The Son had revealed the Father, for him who had eyes to see; and now the Holy Ghost makes us enjoy the presence of the Father and Son, but "in us," if we keep the Saviour's words.<a name=251:9></a>

		We may remark that the scripture employs two different words here: "commandments" and "word.<a name=252:1></a>" Both have their importance, in that the first speaks of authority and obedience, the second of attention to what the Lord says, each having thus a special bearing.<a name=252:2></a> To the soul that has the commandments and keeps them, the Lord manifests Himself, and it is the fruit of obedience; but the blessedness of the abiding of the Father and Son in the heart, is the fruit of the word of Jesus, exercising its rightful influence in the heart.<a name=252:3></a> Now he that does not love Him, he, whose heart is not governed by this personal affection, does not keep the words of Jesus; and the word that they heard was not their Master's word, as of a man, of a teacher who spoke on his own account, but the word of the Father who had sent Jesus.<a name=252:4></a> All the work of grace is indeed the Father's work, but the Son's work also, the Spirit having His place in it in immediate operation in the soul.<a name=252:5></a> Thus the miracles of Jesus were really His own works, but it was by the Spirit of God He cast out demons; the Father also, who dwelt in Him, did the works.<a name=252:6></a> Here the Spirit would teach the disciples and would call to their remembrance that which Jesus had said to them; but that which Jesus had said to them was from the Father; He spoke the words of God, for the Spirit was not given by measure.<a name=252:7></a> Here again we find the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.<a name=252:8></a>

		Finally, if the Lord leaves His own, He leaves them peace, which He could not have done had He remained with them, for peace would not have been made; but He defines this peace in a way that gives it a perfection which the fact of the purifying of the conscience would not have procured for them.<a name=253:8></a> That indeed took place by His blood: the disciples would be perfect as to the conscience.<a name=253:9></a> His conscience was always perfect; ours is made perfect by His blood.<a name=253:10></a> But, with the exception of the cross, and the anticipation of the cross, the heart of Jesus was ever with God.<a name=253:11></a> Feeling everything in love, nothing distracted Him, nor weakened His communion with His Father.<a name=253:12></a> Perfect obedience and confidence maintained in Him a peace which flowed from a walk with God, and from communion with His Father that never belied itself.<a name=253:13></a> The current of the life that He lived on the part of the Father was uninterrupted: there were no breakers in the life of Jesus.<a name=253:14></a> The difficulties He met with were but the occasion of the shewing forth of divine life in the heart of a man, of the peace which the consciousness of being always with God gave Him.<a name=253:15></a> Thus His words and actions were words and actions that came directly from God, in the circumstances in which He found Himself as man.<a name=253:16></a> A perfect sensibility, a perfect measure and characterising in His mind of all that acted upon Him, gave occasion to the answer, to that which the presence of God and the divine impulse produced in man.<a name=253:17></a> What could trouble the peace of Jesus?<a name=253:18></a> When it was a question of being made sin, and of bearing our sins before God, it was another thing; because that was taking place, the answer of God in His soul was not the effect of His perfect and blessed presence, but the being forsaken, according to the perfect opposition of His nature to sin.<a name=253:19></a> But here we approach sufferings that no one can fathom.<a name=253:20></a>

		The Lord had then spoken to His disciples of His Person, above all dispensations, and of their place in Him when the Holy Ghost should have come down, and He had told them how He would make Himself known to them when afar, adding that He left them peace, even the peace He Himself possessed.<a name=255:1></a> Now, in chapter 15, He comes to the truth of His position down here in contrast with Judaism, of their position in relation to His, of their service following upon this position; then of the testimony rendered by the Holy Spirit of promise to the glory into which He was entering on high; and of their testimony as eye witnesses of that which He had been down here.<a name=255:2></a>

		Judaism is thus entirely set aside, and its place taken by Christ Himself.<a name=256:1></a> This is what has happened with regard to all that God had established: the first man himself has been replaced before God by the second; the priesthood of Aaron by that of Christ; the king, son of David; Israel the servant (Isaiah 49: 1), by the Christ (verse 5); even the earthly tabernacle by the true heavenly tabernacle, as well as all its service.<a name=256:2></a> Thus here, Israel was not the true vine, although it had been transplanted as God's vine out of Egypt into Canaan; Psalm 80: 8-16.<a name=256:3></a> Christ was upon earth the true vine of God, the disciples were the branches.<a name=256:4></a> They still thought that Israel was God's vine, and Christ the long-expected Messiah, the principal branch.<a name=256:5></a> But it was not so; Jesus was the vine, they were the branches; His Father, the husbandman.<a name=256:6></a> And they were already clean through the word He had spoken to them.<a name=256:7></a> The passage has occasioned difficulties to many souls, because they have applied these words to the church,<a href="#256:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> but the union of the church with Christ takes place when He is glorified on high, and then we are complete in Him.<a name=256:8></a> There it is no question of bearing fruit, nor of being pruned, but as it is said in 1 John 4: 17: "As he is, so are we in this world.<a name=256:9></a>" In our chapter, Jesus is the true vine upon earth; and there, although Christ could declare them to be clean, their responsibility is developed, in order that they may bear fruit.<a name=256:10></a> They were already clean by the word He had spoken to them.<a name=256:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The union which is in question here is association with Him as disciples.<a name=256:12></a> He no doubt knew them, but they are looked at as being in a position of responsibility.<a name=256:13></a> It is a question of fruit-bearing; if a branch did not bear any, the Father removed it entirely; if it bore fruit, He purified it, that it should bear more.<a name=256:14></a> Not that it was Judaism, far from that; it is Christ, on the contrary, who takes its place.<a name=256:15></a> We see this more than once in the word.<a name=256:16></a> Thus in Isaiah 49, Christ is the true servant in place of Israel.<a name=256:17></a> He is the Son called out of Egypt, a position that Israel occupied: "Let my son go"; Jehovah said by Moses.<a name=256:18></a> In the same way, He is the true vine.<a name=256:19></a> Consequently, the Father is introduced: He is the husbandman.<a name=256:20></a> Thus we find the true moral position that the disciples occupy, as well as the important principles upon which it is founded, but which are connected with that which we have already found as characterising this Gospel.<a name=256:21></a> That which had cleansed the disciples was the word that Jesus had spoken to them; but this cleansing is the same as the Father's.<a name=256:22></a> The Father can use the pruning knife.<a name=256:23></a> He does so evidently as to the branches that do not bear fruit; He does so as to those that bear it.<a name=256:24></a>

		Now, all this is in connection with the revelation of the Father by the Son.<a name=257:1></a> The word that He had spoken to His disciples, was not the revelation of the Son glorified, by the Holy Ghost, but of the Father by the Son.<a name=257:2></a> It was this entirely new things; not what man ought to be according to the law, but what Christ was: grace and truth come by Jesus Christ.<a name=257:3></a> It was the communication of that which was divine, the words of God realised in the life of a man.<a name=257:4></a> The words of Christ were Himself (chapter 8: 25); but they were the words of God (chapter 3: 34), although of a man, by the Spirit without measure; they were of God, revealing the Father in sovereign grace by the Son, sent according to that grace.<a name=257:5></a> (Compare chapter 14: 11.<a name=257:6></a>) It was in the name of holy Father that the Lord kept them during His stay down here: now the Father Himself becomes the husbandman.<a name=257:7></a>

		Now this chapter (except the last verses) does not speak of the testimony of the Holy Ghost, but of that of the disciples (with the help of the Holy Ghost, chapter 14: 25); and it is a testimony, not to His glory on high and the consequences which follow from it, but to that which He had been, and to what He had revealed being down here, to the subjective state of the divine life in a man in this world.<a name=257:8></a> This is what the Gospels essentially present to us; the epistles, in general, have the glory as a starting-point.<a name=257:9></a>

		Thus the first three verses give the position as to detail: then come the exhortations founded upon this.<a name=257:10></a> The first, is to abide in Him.<a name=257:11></a> Let us remark; here that it is always the side of man's responsibility that comes first.<a name=257:12></a> It is not: "I will abide in you, and you will be able thus to abide in me"; but "Abide in me, and I in you.<a name=257:13></a>" The second thing is the effect of the first: there is no verb in the second part of the phrase; it is not that which He would do, but the consequence, the effect stated.<a name=257:14></a> If a soul dwells in Christ, Christ dwells in that soul.<a name=257:15></a> Now a soul dwells in Christ, when it lives in uninterrupted dependence upon Him, and assiduously seeks to realise that which is in Him, that which His presence gives to us, for He is the truth of all that is come to us from the Father, and one lives in it in dwelling in Him.<a name=257:16></a> That which is in Him is communicated to us, as the sap flows from the vine into the branches.<a name=257:17></a> All comes from Him, but there is activity in the soul to cleave to Him, and it is thus that fruit is produced in the branch.<a name=257:18></a> Now we do not dwell in Christ that there may be fruit, but fruit is produced because we dwell in Christ.<a name=257:19></a> We dwell in Christ in the consciousness that we can do nothing without Him, but it is for the love of Christ.<a name=257:20></a> This is the first exhortation, and the first statement of that which we have to do.<a name=257:21></a>

		In the sixth verse, He says no longer "you"; but "If a man," for He knew them, although this be not the subject treated in the passage, yet once one is really in Christ, one is there for ever.<a name=258:1></a> Here, also, it is as in chapter 13, "Ye are clean"; then He adds: "but not all"; for Judas was still there.<a name=258:2></a> If a man did not cleave to Christ, even though associated with Him by profession, he was cut off as a branch to wither and be thrown into the fire.<a name=258:3></a> There is another very important principle found in verse 7.<a name=258:4></a> If the disciples dwelt in Him, and His words dwelt in them, they should have at command the power of the Lord without limit.<a name=258:5></a> Always in the spirit of dependence, it is true, they should ask what they would.<a name=258:6></a> This is the true limit of answers to prayer.<a name=258:7></a> The request is produced in a heart formed by the Saviour's words, and according to the desires created by these words, that is to say, of God Himself who should dwell in the heart.<a name=258:8></a> We never find that the apostles healed, or prayed for the healing of persons who were dear to them, although it be perfectly lawful in such a case to present our requests to God.<a name=258:9></a> But Paul says: "I have left Trophimus sick at Miletus.<a name=258:10></a>" And again: "Epaphroditus was sick, very near to death, but God had mercy on him.<a name=258:11></a>" The works of power they accomplished, had the confirmation of the word as their aim; but it was an immense privilege, in their work of faith, to be assured of the intervention of God when they should ask for it, and that, when the wisdom of God had formed their thoughts, His power should add [to it] His efficacious working.<a name=258:12></a> Christ is the wisdom of God, and the power of God.<a name=258:13></a>

		It will be asked how far we can apply this now.<a name=258:14></a> I do not expect miracles, I do not think that we ought to have them, except lying miracles from Satan; but I believe that if we dwell in Christ, and His words form the heart, if we live by every word that comes from the mouth of God, then when we find ourselves in the conflicts of faith, God gives faith for the circumstances of the service.<a name=258:15></a> He will answer to the faith given, and will hear us, He who disposes of all by means unknown to us, of all hearts -- of the unrighteous as well as of those of the righteous.<a name=258:16></a> But it is important for us (first, so as not to make mistakes; and secondly, to seize the thoughts of God in all their import) to understand the true limits of this promise.<a name=258:17></a> God will never fail of His promise.<a name=258:18></a> The fulfilment of the promise is sure for faith, but the words of the Saviour form the thought of faith to which the promise answers.<a name=258:19></a> It is thus the Father should be glorified, in that they should bear much fruit -- fruit of souls saved by their means, by the revelation of the Father in the Son, that the words of Jesus, words of God in grace, should communicate to them.<a name=258:20></a>

		It is not here a question of the Father's eternal love for the Son, nor of the unchangeable love that God bears to His children, but of the path in which these should enjoy divine love.<a name=259:11></a> Jesus, as man here below, never got out of the enjoyment of that love of the Father.<a name=259:12></a> His obedience had been absolute and perfect, and no cloud had ever found place between His soul and His Father.<a name=259:13></a> His life was a life of perfect obedience and of communion.<a name=259:14></a> They should keep His commandments, and thus they should dwell in His love, even as He dwelt in the Father's love.<a name=259:15></a> He told it them in order that His joy, the joy He had possessed down here, might abide in them, and that their joy should be full.<a name=259:16></a> Here it is Christ's love in a direct way; we are in contact with the Vine, not with the Mediator; with Him in whom we are, not with the Father.<a name=259:17></a> It is a human love, although divine, a love consequently full of sympathy, which comes in in all the details of human life, and of the service of ministry.<a name=259:18></a> This is what took place at the time of His sojourn here below.<a name=259:19></a> It was impossible for the Father to forget Christ one moment in His service down here.<a name=259:20></a> He took knowledge of it; He was there.<a name=259:21></a> It is the same thing with Christ towards us, as far as we keep His commandments.<a name=259:22></a>

		CHAPTER 16
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the Lord goes on to speak with them, not of the position they had enjoyed with Him upon earth, adding promises with regard to the Holy Ghost, but of what was about to take place, of the presence of the Comforter, and of the testimony He would bear.<a name=263:1></a> He had spoken of Him indeed in connection with the relations in which they should be with the Father: there this Comforter replaces Him, and it is the Father that sends Him.<a name=263:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Although the Lord comes spiritually to reveal Himself to them, and, with the Father, to comfort and strengthen them in making their abode with them in chapter 14, the Holy Ghost rather takes the place of the Lord.<a name=263:3></a> In chapter 15 the Saviour speaks of the testimony that the Comforter would bear.<a name=263:4></a> The apostles, with His help, should bear testimony to what Jesus had been down here.<a name=263:5></a> They could not be eye-witnesses of what He is above.<a name=263:6></a> The testimony they would have to bear to His life down here, should be of a much more living character, more rich than a pure revelation from on high would have been, on account of the relations they had found themselves in with Him, all unintelligent as they had been.<a name=263:7></a> But it was a part of His life down here not to be understood by any one.<a name=263:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The testimony they have given to us is indeed that of the Holy Ghost (chapter 14: 26), who has chosen the incidents suitable to communicate the true character of the Saviour, the divine life in Him.<a name=263:9></a> But the grace which manifested itself in Him was exercised every day towards them, or at least in the midst of them.<a name=263:10></a> Always Himself, in a life that He lived on account of the Father, He adapted Himself nevertheless (and could do it because His life was inseparable from the Father) to all the weakness of the disciples, to all that grace required from Him.<a name=263:11></a> It was not purely and simply a divine testimony, but as His own Person, never losing its divine perfection.<a name=263:12></a> His unalterable purity took all the colours that the circumstances which surrounded Him gave to this life in His grace.<a name=263:13></a> The account is a wholly divine account, but which, in that which it relates, expresses itself, by human hearts who have passed through it.<a name=263:14></a> That which Christ is on high would not be expressed thus.<a name=263:15></a> There all is perfect, His personal glory is accomplished.<a name=263:16></a> Patient gentleness, unshaken firmness, divine wisdom in the midst of evil, and of adversaries, are no longer in place; it is the glory that is revealed.<a name=263:17></a> And who shall reveal it, if not He who came from it, and who is ill it?<a name=263:18></a>

		In chapter 14 the Father sends the Holy Ghost in the name of Jesus, and gives us the consciousness of our place before Himself, as sons with the Son.<a name=264:1></a> Here, it is Christ, the Son of man, who sends Him from the Father, from whom the Holy Ghost proceeds, and He bears witness to Christ Himself.<a name=264:2></a> He is the "Spirit of truth," a purely divine testimony of the things that are above; the Spirit that is of God, that we may know the things that are freely given to us of God.<a name=264:3></a> The testimony borne to the life of Christ down here, is a testimony fully divine, but that is borne through the circumstances through which Jesus passed, and by persons who were themselves in them, so that we may know what God was in the midst of fallen humanity; immense grace that awakens all the affections of a heart taught by the Holy Ghost, and engrosses it.<a name=264:4></a><a href="#264:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>

		But whatever might be the privileges of which they were going to partake by the Holy Ghost's presence, they would have to undergo at the same time the consequences of their Master's rejection, a rejection which was not merely that of an enlightened reformer who was not liked, but the expression of the enmity of man's heart against God, and against God manifested in goodness.<a name=264:5></a> He was going on high, and was going to make them partakers of the Spirit; they remained down here, furnished no doubt, with that spiritual power up to the point of doing miracles, which would bear testimony to the source whence they came; but the continuance of the testimony and of the power, would bring against them the same hostility which had been manifested against Jesus.<a name=264:6></a> If they had called the Master of the house Beelzebub, much more would they treat those of the household in the same way.<a name=264:7></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#264:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>If we examine with spiritual intelligence the different accounts of the gospels, we perceive at once a purpose that is not expressed in so many words, but by means of the circumstances themselves, although in relation with men. For instance, John does not speak of the agony of Jesus in Gethsemane, although he was nearer to Him, and of the number of those that Jesus awakened from their sleep. It is, that in John, the Holy Ghost gives the divine side of this touching history. Thus here also the band of men is spoken of, who, coming to take Jesus, were thrown down at His presence. Matthew, who, nevertheless, saw it, does not speak of it. For him, Christ is the Victim, suffering and put to death; for John, He is the One who offers Himself without spot to God. It is the same everywhere.

		And more, it was a religious hatred.<a name=265:1></a> If a religion adapts itself to the world, and costs the selfish principle nothing, it is held to; one prides oneself upon it still more if, by the truth that is recognised, one can raise oneself above others.<a name=265:2></a> Now this hatred, whilst recognising indeed its object -- that is, the revelation of God in this world -- was an ignorant hatred, especially for the multitudes.<a name=265:3></a> The hatred of the leaders was more moral, more positively diabolical, as the Lord had said to them.<a name=265:4></a> (chapter 8).<a name=265:5></a> The masses were jealous for their religion, as Paul acknowledged (Acts 22: 3); the leaders detested that which was manifested, because it was the light.<a name=265:6></a> Terrible state!<a name=265:7></a> But what can a state be that opposes itself with a resolute will, with animosity, to such a Saviour?<a name=265:8></a> The Lord says that he who should kill His disciples would think to do God service.<a name=265:9></a> It is what Saul of Tarsus was doing.<a name=265:10></a> But the leaders, the Lord said, "had both seen and hated both me and my Father.<a name=265:11></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But here some practical truths come out of what is said.<a name=265:12></a> It is by the revelation of a new truth that the heart is exercised and tested; I say new, at least for the heart that finds it.<a name=265:13></a> One gains credit by an old truth; the Jews believed in one only true God, and they were quite right.<a name=265:14></a> It was a privilege, a moral advantage of immense bearing.<a name=265:15></a> In truth, there was but that God; as far as there was reality in Paganism, the gods of the pagans were demons.<a name=265:16></a> But, although the pious Jew acknowledged this true God, obeyed Him and trusted in Him, it was the glory of the nation to have this God for God, and the Jew without piety boasted also in Him.<a name=265:17></a> But alas!<a name=265:18></a> he saw the power that bore witness to God's presence, elsewhere than in the temple, its earthly abode.<a name=265:19></a> The house, fine as it was, was empty; and a double hatred broke out against that which was the proof of it.<a name=265:20></a> God had brought in quite a new thing; the Father had sent the Son in grace, and had manifested Himself in Him, and this grace could not be limited to a Jew alone.<a name=265:21></a> It penetrated as light to the bottom of the heart of man, whether Jew or Gentile.<a name=265:22></a> The one and the other were sinners.<a name=265:23></a> The Jew had manifested it in the rejection of this Son, and sovereign grace extended itself to the Gentiles.<a name=265:24></a> The Jewish sinner had just as much need of it; the partition wall had fallen down at the cross.<a name=265:25></a> It was God and man now, not Jew and Gentile.<a name=265:26></a> In vain God had recognised the privileges of the Jews; in vain had He sent His Son, according to the promises, to the lost sheep of the house of Israel; Israel would have none of it; they desired their own glory.<a name=265:27></a> From this comes that for them, the Jews, he who would destroy such a testimony, the testimony of an infinite grace, of the Father sending the Son into the world, of grace exercised in salvation towards sinners, Jews or Gentiles -- he who would destroy it, I say, would do God service.<a name=265:28></a> He would think to render service to God, to his own God, the God who made his glory.<a name=265:29></a> As to the Father and Son, he did not know them; this was the new truth that put to the proof the state of his heart.<a name=265:30></a> A good Protestant can boast in rejecting the deification of the host, and in believing in justification by faith as a dogma: that is his glory as a Protestant.<a name=265:31></a> But where is his soul as to the presence of the Holy Ghost, and the expectation of the Saviour?<a name=265:32></a> New truths always confirm the old, judging at the same time superstitions; but faith in the old, which make our own glory, is not a touchstone for the state of soul, although we are to maintain them carefully.<a name=265:33></a>

		There is another remark of the Saviour which merits our particular attention.<a name=266:1></a> It is simple, but exposes the state of our souls.<a name=266:2></a> "Now," He says, "I go unto him that hath sent me, and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?<a name=266:3></a>" Sorrow had filled their heart.<a name=266:4></a> It was very natural, and in a certain sense very right.<a name=266:5></a> They felt the present and actual effect of the departure of Jesus.<a name=266:6></a> This touched them very closely, but they judged of the circumstances entirely in connection with themselves.<a name=266:7></a> They had given up all for the Lord, and they were going to lose Him; and not only that, but they must give up all, that for them was connected with His presence down here; all their Jewish hopes were fading away.<a name=266:8></a> They felt the effect of the circumstances upon themselves, but did not think of the purposes of God which were being accomplished in those circumstances, for the Son of God was not going out of this world by an accident.<a name=266:9></a> It is the same thing in our most minute circumstances: not a sparrow falls to the ground without our Father.<a name=266:10></a> That which troubled them was in reality the work of redemption.<a name=266:11></a> Moreover, that which constitutes our cross in this world answers to glory and happiness in the other.<a name=266:12></a> Preoccupation with the circumstances, hid from them heavenly things, and the glory into which the Lamb was entering.<a name=266:13></a>

		But this remark introduces, not the heavenly glory of the Lord -- though what He says depends on it -- but the consequence for them down here, which is what should occupy us now.<a name=267:1></a> It is the coming down here of the Comforter, of the Paraclete.<a name=267:2></a> His presence in this world should have for its object to convince of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment.<a name=267:3></a> It is not the question here of demonstrating to a man's conscience the sins of which he is guilty, but of a testimony as to the state of the world, and that by the very presence of the Holy Spirit, though He bore it also to men.<a name=267:4></a> Sin had been manifested for a long time in the world; the law had been transgressed; but now God Himself was come in grace.<a name=267:5></a> All His perfections, His goodness, and His power, which were in exercise to deliver from the effects of sin, had been manifested in this world, and all in grace towards men, with a patience which remained perfect to the end; and man <i>would</i> not have God.<a name=267:6></a> God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto Himself, not imputing their trespasses to them; but man would none of it.<a name=267:7></a> This is sin: not the conviction of disorderly lusts, nor of transgressions against God's law, but the final and formal rejection of God Himself.<a name=267:8></a> The Holy Ghost would not have been there if that had not taken place.<a name=267:9></a> Moreover, we have the solemn spectacle of the only righteous One, who had glorified God in everything, and had been obedient to Him in every trial, abandoned by God, when, persecuted by men, He appealed to Him, and all is over for the world.<a name=267:10></a> No righteousness is seen, except in the judgment of sin in the Person of Him who had not known sin, but who had been made sin before God, having offered Himself to God for that, that God might be glorified in it.<a name=267:11></a>

		But with regard to the disciples, the Spirit would reveal the truth fully to them, and lead their minds into the knowledge of all the truth.<a name=270:1></a> The truth is the manner in which God regards all things, and what He reveals of Himself, of His own thoughts, and of His own counsels.<a name=270:2></a> Now Christ is the expression of it on the positive side, as being God manifested to man, and Man perfect before God.<a name=270:3></a> Being the light, He manifests all that is not according to God's thoughts.<a name=270:4></a> The veil too, being rent, and Christ having entered into heaven as Man, and seated at God's right hand, that which was not within the province of human knowledge, "that which eye hath not seen, nor ear heard," the Spirit reveals, and He reveals even the deepest things of God.<a name=270:5></a> All, from God's eternal throne down to hades, and from hades up to the throne of God, and redemption which is connected with it, all is disclosed.<a name=270:6></a> And it is in Christ that all this revelation is made to us; but also, all that is revealed on God's part belongs to Him.<a name=270:7></a> "All that the Father hath is mine," He says; and it is not only that which is of God, as God, as creation for example, but all that which, in the counsels of grace, forms the new creation in relationship with the Father; that belongs to Him.<a name=270:8></a>

		These words then (verse 16, etc.<a name=272:5></a>), although their full and entire accomplishment should only take place when Christ returns, refer to events of all importance, which, in His death and resurrection, shewed, in a characteristic way, what He was doing and who He was.<a name=272:6></a> First of all, He was going to leave His own, and to put an end by His death, to all the relations of God with Israel and with man: "A little while and ye shall not see me" -- He was going to die.<a name=272:7></a> "And again a little while and ye shall see me.<a name=272:8></a>" He was not going to stay like other men in the dust of the tomb; He would be with them again.<a name=272:9></a> But once more they should not see Him, for He came not to be a Messiah upon earth, but He was going to His Father who ruled over death, and who, after having raised Him, according to His glory, would take Him to Himself in the glory that was His.<a name=272:10></a> It was a series of events, which, while they constituted the disciples eye-witnesses of the fact of His resurrection, belonged to His personal glory and to redemption, to the setting aside of all that is connected with the first man, to the glory that He, the Son of God, had had with the Father before the foundation of the world, and into which He was about to enter again as Man to order all things at the suitable time, according to the glory of God and His counsels with regard to the Man in whom He would glorify Himself.<a name=272:11></a>

		The Lord answers the hidden desire of the heart of His disciples, who sought in vain to solve the enigma lying in His words, and who feared to ask Him anything; but it is by shewing them first of all, the feelings that would possess their hearts, and then the true character of His coming and of His departure.<a name=273:1></a> Their hearts would be deeply afflicted; they were going to lose Him for whom they had left everything: hope founded upon Him was fading away.<a name=273:2></a> The world, on the contrary, would be quite happy to be rid of Him who troubled it by the testimony of the truth.<a name=273:3></a> But Jesus tells His own that He would see them again, and that their sorrow should be turned into joy, as when a woman brings forth.<a name=273:4></a> And in fact it was the child-birth of the new creation.<a name=273:5></a> Thus the joy with which they should be filled in seeing Him again would be an eternal joy -- a joy that nothing could take from them.<a name=273:6></a>

		Thus far for the human details; but the ground of the truth is that the Son had come forth from the Father and come into the world, and that He left the world and went to the Father.<a name=273:7></a> This was a declaration of incalculable importance, and before which both the disciples' sorrow at the loss of their Messiah, Son of David, and their joy at seeing Him risen again, faded entirely, real and important as they were.<a name=273:8></a> Indeed, it was the revelation of God Himself in grace, and in the accomplishment of all His ways; Man in Christ was the object of them, and the heavenly glory into which He was now entering was the result, the real fact that was taking place.<a name=273:9></a> The Son, Man in this world; the Father, perfectly and fully revealed; those who had received Him set in the place of sons with the Father, co-heirs with the Son; and the Father's house the place of their dwelling and blessing: this is what the presence and departure of Jesus meant.<a name=273:10></a> It was laying the foundation of the whole of eternity; the full revelation of the Father and of the Son.<a name=273:11></a>

		This terminates the Lord's discourses addressed to His disciples.<a name=274:4></a> He, in presence of that which His soul experienced, could think of them and tell them that which was suited to comfort them and to strengthen them in the time of His absence; it was the spiritual knowledge of Himself; the seeing Him after His resurrection, which would strengthen their faith powerfully; the presence of the Holy Ghost; and finally, that in going to the Father, it was not to abandon them, but that He was going there to prepare for them a dwelling-place on high.<a name=274:5></a> Spiritually He would be with them.<a name=274:6></a> If they confessed His name, this would bring upon them persecutions.<a name=274:7></a> In this world they should have tribulation, but in Him they had peace.<a name=274:8></a> Blessed thought!<a name=274:9></a> In the circumstances and in the things that were passing, they would have testing, painful no doubt, but which would detach them from the world, and make them feel the contrast between what was such and their position.<a name=274:10></a> Inwardly they should have peace, divine peace in Him who appeared to them spiritually, yea, who should dwell in them.<a name=274:11></a>

		CHAPTER 17
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The key to this chapter is the word "Father.<a name=275:1></a>" At the commencement, the Lord lays the great foundations of the position that He was taking at that moment, and then those of the position of the disciples.<a name=275:2></a> After that, He states what is their relationship with the Father, and their place before the world, and He closes by making known their place with Him in heaven, and the power of the Father's love during their stay here below.<a name=275:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord, here, as in the whole of John's Gospel, is regarded from the point of view of His divine nature, the Son of the Father, but at the same time never leaving the place of service.<a name=275:4></a> He receives everything, and appropriates nothing to Himself.<a name=275:5></a> Once only, in contrast with an empty temple, He presents Himself to the Jews -- at least He presents His body -- as the true temple which, as God, He would rebuild in three days.<a name=275:6></a> But in His teaching, in the personal expression of relationship with the Father, He never leaves the subordinate place that He had taken in His service.<a name=275:7></a> Satan, in the desert, had tried, but in vain, to make Him leave it.<a name=275:8></a> He would obey, and He was obedient unto death.<a name=275:9></a> Here also, He does not appropriate to Himself the glory, but the hour being come, He asks His Father to glorify Him.<a name=275:10></a> It is the Son of the Father who is glorified, it is His personal glory; it is not the Son of man glorified according to the counsels of God.<a name=275:11></a> It is the Father who does it.<a name=275:12></a> In chapter 13, Jesus speaks of Himself as the Son of man who has glorified <i>God</i>, and that in His work on the cross.<a name=275:13></a> Then God, as God, having been glorified, the Son of man enters, according to the value of His work, into the glory of God, which He has established on earth where sin reigned.<a name=275:14></a> There, man made sin, and the power of Satan, the judgment and love of God met together, and God has been fully glorified; what He is has been manifested and made good In the obedience of man.<a name=275:15></a> Here, it is the Son, who, having perfectly manifested the Father and glorified Him, re-enters, being Man, into the glory that He had had with Him before the world was, in order to glorify Him in this new position also.<a name=275:16></a>

		His position as Son, and what belongs to Him being Man, is then stated.<a name=276:1></a> His rights are twofold: He has power over all flesh, but with the object of giving eternal life to those whom the Father has given Him.<a name=276:2></a> His title to power with regard to man is universal.<a name=276:3></a><a href="#276:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> If the first man should have power according to nature, the Son, become man, has it in a supernatural manner.<a name=276:4></a> But here, in the words of the Saviour, one of the most precious truths for us comes to light.<a name=276:5></a> There are those whom the Father has given to the Son.<a name=276:6></a> It is the thought and settled purpose of the Father.<a name=276:7></a> They are given to the Son; the Father has committed them to His hands, in order that He may bring them into the glory, in order that He may fit them for the presence, the nature, and the glory of God, for all that was in this settled purpose; and that He may place them, according to God's infinite love, in a position which should satisfy this love, and which is that of the Son, become Man to this effect.<a name=276:8></a> We can add that it is a position that answers to the value and efficacy of the work of the Son to place them there, not only externally (which, however, would be impossible), but in endowing them with a nature fit for such a position.<a name=276:9></a> Marvellous grace, of which we are the objects!<a name=276:10></a> This position is <i>eternal life</i>, a word of which we must examine a little the meaning.<a name=276:11></a> It is spiritual and divine life -- a life capable of knowing God and of enjoying Him, as answering morally to His nature, "holy and without blame before him in love.<a name=276:12></a>" Eternal life, that is to say, a life not merely immortal, but which belongs to a world that is outside the senses; for "the things that are not seen are eternal.<a name=276:13></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is something more precise than that.<a name=276:14></a> In 1 John 1 we see definitely what eternal life is: it is Christ.<a name=276:15></a> That which they had seen, contemplated, and handled from the beginning, it was Christ, the eternal life which was with the Father and had been manifested to them.<a name=276:16></a> Thus again, in chapter 5: 11, 12: "This is the testimony, that God has given unto us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.<a name=276:17></a> He that hath the Son, hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God, hath not life.<a name=276:18></a>" Paul, in the Epistle to the Ephesians (chapter 1: 3, 4) presents to us this life in its double character.<a name=276:19></a> In the first place, that which answers to His nature, that which Christ was and is personally; and secondly, our relationship with the Father; that is to say, sons, and that in His presence.<a name=276:20></a> We participate in the divine nature, and we are in the position of Christ: sons according to the good pleasure of the Father's will.<a name=276:21></a> That is the nature of this life.<a name=276:22></a>

		Here it is presented objectively.<a name=277:1></a> In fact, in our relations with God, that which is the object of faith is the power of life in us.<a name=277:2></a> Thus Paul says: "When it pleased God to reveal his Son in me"; but in receiving, by grace, by faith, the Saviour that he was to preach to others, he received life, for Christ is our life.<a name=277:3></a> But, as I have already said, it is the name of the Father that is the key to this chapter.<a name=277:4></a> God is always the same; but neither the name of Almighty, nor that of Jehovah, nor that of Most High, carries life in itself.<a name=277:5></a> We must have it to know God thus, but the Father sent the Son that we might live through Him, and he that has the Son, has life, and he only.<a name=277:6></a> But the Son has fully manifested the Father; so that the Son being received, the Father was also; and the life displayed itself in this knowledge, faith in the mission of the Son, and by Him, faith in the Father in sending the Son, in love, as Saviour.<a name=277:7></a> The glory of Christ Himself will be the full manifestation of this life, and we shall participate in it, we shall be like Him.<a name=277:8></a> Still it is an inward life, real and divine, by which we live, although we possess it in these poor earthen vessels.<a name=277:9></a> It is no longer we that live, but Christ that lives in us.<a name=277:10></a> Infinite and eternal blessedness which belongs to us already as life, according to these words: "he that hath the Son, hath life.<a name=277:11></a>" But this places us also in the position of sons now, and brings us, later on, to bear the image of Christ.<a name=277:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Note also that all the fulness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily.<a name=277:13></a> However, this is not what is presented to us here, but the ways of God as Father in grace, and source of all in blessing; it is the Father who sends the Son.<a name=277:14></a> (Compare 1 John 4: 14.<a name=277:15></a>) No doubt, it is the Holy Ghost that makes us to know the Father thus, and who renders us capable of having communion with Him, and with His Son Jesus Christ.<a name=277:16></a> In this development of grace, He is the power that works in us.<a name=277:17></a> The Father, who had in His grace the thought of sending, and who in fact has sent, His Son into the world; then the Son thus sent, in whom this grace is known; such are the effects that we know.<a name=277:18></a> The Father, in His divine and eternal thoughts, is the source of all this infinite grace, and the Son is the One in whom these thoughts are realised, who gave Himself to accomplish all, and that we might have part in all.<a name=277:19></a> He gave Himself, in order to accomplish all that was needed to bring us to the Father according to these thoughts; fit for God's presence, like unto Him who has brought us there.<a name=277:20></a> "A body hast thou prepared me; lo, I come to do thy will, O God!<a name=277:21></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		Observe also, that it is not the essence of His nature that is presented here, but the development of grace.<a name=278:1></a> Although He had had, with the Father, before the world was, the glory into which He was going to enter again, nevertheless, as we have seen everywhere, He is the sent One of the Father; He receives all from Him, and takes the initiative in nothing of His own will, except in undertaking the work that He should accomplish; but comes to do the Father's will.<a name=278:2></a> He empties Himself of this part of the divine rights, free then to undertake all, having the same will with the Father.<a name=278:3></a> But the work that He undertook was, from one end to the other, a work of pure obedience.<a name=278:4></a> It was at His expense that the work was done, but according to the thoughts and will of the Father.<a name=278:5></a> He never left this position.<a name=278:6></a> He could say "I am" John 8: 58); but He lived by every word that came out of the mouth of God.<a name=278:7></a> The perfection of the work was obedience in love.<a name=278:8></a> Adonai (the Lord) whom we see in Isaiah 6: 1, this Jehovah whose glory fills the earth, it is Christ; John 12: 39-41.<a name=278:9></a> He is Adonai, at Jehovah's right hand, Adonai who smites the kings in the day of wrath; Psalm 110: 5.<a name=278:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such then are the relationships in which we know God now.<a name=278:11></a> It is not simply a supreme God, the Most High; it is not only He "who is, who was, and who is to come," He who, always the same, accomplishes His promises; nor any more the mighty God, the all-powerful who keeps His own.<a name=278:12></a> All this is true; but these titles are connected with God governing the world, accomplishing His promises, and keeping His own down here.<a name=278:13></a> Here it is God Himself who reveals Himself, as the Father who has sent the Son, to bring us to Him according to the full manifestation of what He is in Himself, partaking morally of His nature, His own sons, and destined to be like Christ.<a name=278:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the Son had fully glorified the Father down here; He had finished the work that the Father had entrusted to Him, and He asks to be re-admitted into the glory that He had had with the Father before the world was.<a name=278:15></a> The Father had sent Him, He had glorified the Father and finished the work He had to do, and now He was going to return into His former glory, the glory of the Son, but He re-entered it as man.<a name=278:16></a>

		Up to this the foundations are laid; Christ ever seeking to glorify the Father, even when He should have re-entered into the glory that belonged to Him.<a name=279:1></a> All was accomplished with regard to His mission.<a name=279:2></a> Sent on the part of God, and from Him, become man to glorify Him down here, He had done it; for he who had seen the Son had seen the Father.<a name=279:3></a> Then He receives the glory from the Father, and sits on His throne, a glorified Man, but Son, in the eternal glory He had had.<a name=279:4></a> But the object of His mission was also to give eternal life to those whom the Father had given Him.<a name=279:5></a> Now, those who knew God thus, the Father, and Jesus, the Christ whom He had sent, possessed this life.<a name=279:6></a>

		This part of the Saviour's words (verses 6-10, and even up to verse 19, although this last portion treats of the disciples from another point of view) applies to the eleven, as companions of Christ upon earth.<a name=281:1></a> He had revealed the Father's name to them; He was placing them in the relationship in which He was Himself with the Father, as Son, but dwelling upon earth.<a name=281:2></a> The communications which He received were made to Him as being there, and were those that He communicated to them.<a name=281:3></a> I have no doubt whatever that Jesus spoke of what He knew, and bore witness to what He had seen; nor that the fact that He could say of Himself, "the Son of man that is in heaven" (John 3: 13), bad an essential influence upon His ministry.<a name=281:4></a> But He was the manifestation of grace and truth down here, and up to the time that He was speaking, it was not a question of giving the disciples the consciousness that they were in Him in heaven; that was about to take place.<a name=281:5></a> In verse 24, this thought, not yet of union, but at least of association with Him in heaven, begins to dawn.<a name=281:6></a> His object assuredly was not to maintain Judaism, but to present that which manifested the Father, grace and truth come in Him, the character of God in a Man down here shewn out fully.<a name=281:7></a> It was not, either, to develop the counsels of God and the mysteries of grace, as Paul teaches them to us; that is a fruit of Jesus being glorified.<a name=281:8></a> The sun had shone behind the clouds in the previous dispensations; even now it is faith that lays hold of it; at the end, its manifestation will have an earthly character; but here the clouds disperse, and the sun itself appears.<a name=281:9></a> The Father in the fulness of grace, sends the Son; the Son manifests the Father perfectly, and glorifies Him, and the disciples understand that all that the Father had given to Jesus was the gift of the Father to the Son down here (not, as I have said, of Jehovah to the Messiah), that the Father had sent Him in sovereign grace, and that He had come from the Father.<a name=281:10></a>

		The first motive is found in these words: "I pray for them, because they are thine.<a name=282:6></a>" For the beloved Son, the Father was everything; He lived to glorify Him, and He prays that the Father may be for those who are His, such a Father as He Himself knew Him.<a name=282:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The second motive is the Son.<a name=282:8></a> The Father cared for the Son's glory; because of this, He was to take care of His disciples, for now that Jesus was going back to the Father, it is in them that He was to be glorified.<a name=282:9></a> The Father would keep them because they belonged to Him, and that in them the Son should be glorified.<a name=282:10></a> It was necessary that they should be kept if the Father cared for the glory of the Son.<a name=282:11></a> Now there was no separation between the interests and glory of the Father and the interests and glory of the Son.<a name=282:12></a> All that belonged to the Father belonged to the Son, and all that belonged to the Son belonged to the Father.<a name=282:13></a> What a bond between the Father, the Son, and the disciples?<a name=282:14></a> They belonged to the Father, the Father had given them to the Son, and it was in them that the Son was to be glorified.<a name=282:15></a> Their present position, which gave occasion to the request, was that Jesus was going away from the world to the Father, and that He was leaving His disciples down here.<a name=282:16></a>

		Now for the accomplishment of this sanctification in them, an object is introduced in the Person of Christ Himself -- Christ, I believe, glorified; however, His Person remains the same.<a name=285:1></a> One might have supposed that the Son, eternally One with the Father in His divine nature, and who had been Son down here, introducing this relationship into human nature, but always able to say: "I and my Father are one"; one might have supposed, I say, that He would have laid aside this human garb in leaving this world, in order to enter again into His simply divine position.<a name=285:2></a> But no!<a name=285:3></a> He keeps it in the glory.<a name=285:4></a> He sets Himself apart in the glory as Man; always Son, but in the glory that He had with the Father before the world was, in order that this relationship with the Father, in which man is placed in His Person, might be effectively revealed in its perfection and in its fulness to the hearts of the disciples, that these hearts filled with what He was, might be at the same time sanctified according to this perfection, and thus made fit to be the vessels of it in their testimony.<a name=285:5></a> Thus the truth of what the Father is -- the truth that sanctified them -- was not, so to speak, a dry doctrine, applied to their souls to form them, judging evil and communicating that which was suitable, but a living reality which placed them in this position, with all the affections which were connected with a Person, in whom they were and who was in them, a Saviour known and beloved, who had been bound up with them in grace.<a name=285:6></a> All the fulness of the result of this relationship, established in its perfection in heaven, formed their heart according to this perfection.<a name=285:7></a>

		This is what completes that which Jesus asks for the disciples before the Father, and in testimony before the world: the revelation of the name of the Father known in the Person of the Son, Man in this world and in the glory.<a name=285:8></a> But His prayer does not stop there; blessed be His name for ever!<a name=285:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Jesus prays also for those who were to believe through their means; but the request is not the same as that which He made for the disciples, although it depends upon it.<a name=285:10></a> For them He asked a unity analogous to that which existed between the Father and the Son in the work of redemption; the same thoughts, the same counsels, the same truth.<a name=285:11></a> The Son accomplished the Father's thoughts in the unity of the same nature.<a name=285:12></a> They were, by the absorbing power of the Holy Ghost, to act in the work of testimony, as being absolutely and entirely one.<a name=285:13></a> No divergence existed between the thoughts, the counsels, the will of the Father, and the testimony and obedience of the Son; and, by grace, the disciples became the depositary, one and all together, of the testimony of the revelation of the Father in the Son.<a name=285:14></a> Also, the Father's word having been confided to them, their function was to communicate it to others.<a name=285:15></a> They were communicators of these truths; the others, for whom the Saviour now prays, received this testimony, and thus entered into communion with those who were in the unity of this grace.<a name=285:16></a> (Compare 1 John 1: 1-4.<a name=285:17></a>) They enjoyed all that of which the disciples were the depositaries.<a name=285:18></a> The Lord prays that they may be one with them, the Father and the Son.<a name=285:19></a> It is always the Father revealed in the Son that is the basis of their union.<a name=285:20></a> Now this revelation gave them a heavenly object, one only and the same object that absorbed the heart's affections, and thus destroyed the influence of the earthly objects that would have tended to divide them, such as their social or national position, and even what was still more difficult, their religious position.<a name=285:21></a> They were Christians, sons of the Father, associated with Christ; their fatherland was heaven.<a name=285:22></a> Pilgrims and strangers down here, they declared plainly that they sought their native country.<a name=285:23></a> Now, in this, they were necessarily one; one in their origin, one in their object, and that with Christ Himself, the Son of the Father.<a name=285:24></a> He that sanctified and they who were sanctified were all of one.<a name=285:25></a> (See Hebrews 2: 11.<a name=285:26></a>) They formed part of the company of those to whom the Saviour had said: "I ascend unto my Father and your Father, unto my God and your God.<a name=285:27></a>" In this spiritual position, they were one in the Father and in the Son, who were one in themselves, and all together lived in this communion.<a name=285:28></a> Thus in 1 John 1, we read: "that ye may have fellowship with us: and our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ," and then we have fellowship "one with another.<a name=285:29></a>"

		Thus, inasmuch as Christians, brought to the knowledge of the Father in the Son, the motives that animate and govern the world, had disappeared: "As is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.<a name=286:1></a>" In this case John never speaks of the inconsistencies that may be shewn in the walk, nor the Saviour either, but He speaks of the thing in itself.<a name=286:2></a> Now the world was to see this unity (compare Acts 2 and 4), and the disappearance of all the motives that govern this world, a clear testimony to the revelation of the Father in the Son.<a name=286:3></a> It was the testimony that the Father had sent the Son into the world; for there is seen a people there formed by a power that was not at all of the world, and which, in overturning all human barriers, would give them but one heart and one soul, so that they were irrefragable witnesses of the reality of that which governed them.<a name=286:4></a> Such are Christians, led by the word of the Father, subject to the influence of this word, and living by it.<a name=286:5></a>

		We have seen that the doctrine of the chapter, even eternal life, is the knowledge of the Father, and Christ sent by Him.<a name=287:6></a> Now this is accomplished in the glory.<a name=287:7></a> First of all, Christ a man, Son of God, in glory, is the source of the sanctification of His own according to that knowledge, the disciples and those that believed, being introduced by their means in spirit into the position where Christ was.<a name=287:8></a> In the second place, this relationship of association with Christ is transferred into the glory before the Father; not as now, realised by faith, but they themselves are transformed in this glory.<a name=287:9></a> It is union, perfect in nature, thoughts, and state -- "as we are one"; Christ in them, so that their position was fully realised, and the Father in Christ, so that the spiritual connection that we have seen all through the chapter -- the Father revealed in the Son, and Christ revealed in the disciples and believers -- was now not only spiritually known, but gloriously realised.<a name=287:10></a>

		But let us here notice what is striking and important.<a name=287:11></a> The three unities relate to the world.<a name=287:12></a> First, the word of God had been confided to the disciples, conjointly depositaries of the truth, so that the world hated them (vers.<a name=287:13></a> 11-14); then, secondly, we have the unity of communion, that the world might <i>believe</i> (verse 24) in seeing the effect and the power of the present testimony; then, thirdly, the disciples and believers are made partakers of the glory given to the Son as Man; He in them, and the Father in Him, so that the whole of these thoughts, of grace so infinite which unites the Father, the Son as Man, and believers, being manifested in glory, the world will know (and not believe) that the Son had been sent from the Father, and that believers were loved by the Father as the Son Himself.<a name=287:14></a> The proof of it will be there: the Son manifested in glory, and believers in the same glory as He.<a name=287:15></a> This will be the visible accomplishment of the doctrine, of the marvellous truth with which the chapter is taken up: the Father in the Son as Man, and believers glorified with Him.<a name=287:16></a> But whether it be a scene of testimony or of glory, it is the world that is before our eyes.<a name=287:17></a>

		In what follows, this is not the case, and it is this that gives quite another character to these last verses.<a name=288:1></a> "Father, I will that they also whom thou hast given me be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me, for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.<a name=288:2></a>" We see here, as we have seen throughout, that Christ speaks of Himself as man, though also as Son of the Father; as man, divested outwardly of the divine glory in which He had been -- "the form of God" as we read in Philippians 2 -- and having taken "the form of a servant" in humanity.<a name=288:3></a> The Father has given the glory on high to the Man Christ.<a name=288:4></a> He had had, He says in this same chapter, this glory with the Father before the foundation of the world, but He was going back into it as man, for as man it is clear that He had never had it.<a name=288:5></a> He was not yet glorified.<a name=288:6></a> Never, down here, though He said and shewed that He was one with the Father, and "I am" (John 8: 59), and said to the Jews: "Destroy this temple [His body where God was], and in three days I will raise it up"; never would He go outside this position of servant: He took a body in order to be obedient to His Father; Psalm 40.<a name=288:7></a> Moreover, a man who had not been so, would have been by the very fact, in evil: it was this that Satan sought to lead Him into; Matthew 4.<a name=288:8></a> The Father had proclaimed: "This is my beloved Son"; and in the first temptation, Satan says to Him: "If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones become bread"; but the Lord withstood his wiles, refusing to leave the place of obedience: "Man," He says, "shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.<a name=288:9></a>" Thus, in speaking as Man in the midst of His own, He speaks of the glory into which He was going to enter, as being given Him of God.<a name=288:10></a> Nevertheless He presents it here objectively as His personal glory.<a name=288:11></a>

		But this request relates also to another solemn truth.<a name=289:11></a> He was going to suffer; the history of His sufferings begins with the nest chapter.<a name=289:12></a> The world had rejected Him; the Father must decide between Him and the world.<a name=289:13></a> He had fully revealed the Father, and the world had not known Him who had manifested Himself in Christ.<a name=289:14></a> It was moral blindness that only saw the carpenter's son there, where the Father had been manifested in all His grace and all His goodness.<a name=289:15></a> But Jesus, as man in the world, had known the Father, and the disciples had known that it was the Father, who had sent Him.<a name=289:16></a> Now the end had come, the close of His earthly career; the result was to declare itself.<a name=289:17></a> The Father's righteousness was about to place Him in His house, and the world was left without God, who had been there in grace, and without the Saviour.<a name=289:18></a>

		The world will know objectively the love wherewith we have been loved, when we shall appear in the same glory as Christ; we ourselves know it, as being the conscious objects of it; knowing this love in the Father, in the Son as being its worthy and infinite object, and we -- He being in us -- participating in it in the manner in which He enjoys it as Man.<a name=291:1></a> God alone could have such thoughts.<a name=291:2></a>

		CHAPTER 18
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have been through the wonderful chapter, in which is presented to us the touching development of the communion of the Son with the Father with regard to the object of their common interest, the children, believers put into relationship with the Father by His revelation in the Son.<a name=291:3></a> The more we think of it, the more we feel how marvellous it is to be admitted to hear such communications.<a name=291:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But let us continue our study of the Gospel.<a name=291:5></a> That which follows, is the account of the last events of the life of Christ, as also of His death, of His resurrection and all that belongs to them.<a name=291:6></a> The sufferings of Christ are not the subject of John's Gospel, but His divine Person, and this character is found again here.<a name=291:7></a> We do not find suffering either in Gethsemane or upon the cross, but a direct testimony borne to His divinity, as to His perfect human obedience.<a name=291:8></a> There is another element less important, but which comes out in a clear light; it is, the moral setting aside of the Jews, a subject of sorrow for the Saviour Himself and for us, for which the sovereign grace of God will provide a remedy; but here they fall into marked contempt, even from the Gentiles.<a name=291:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The sufferings of Christ not being related, there is far less detail.<a name=291:10></a> It is great principles, great facts, that are put in the foreground in the account, or at least spring out of it.<a name=291:11></a> I hope it will not be hazarding too much for souls, to pass in review the different accounts found in the Gospels of what took place in Gethsemane and upon the cross.<a name=291:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Matthew, Christ is the Victim; there is neither comforter nor consolation, but the sleep of His own, and betrayal with kisses in Gethsemane; and upon the cross: "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?<a name=291:13></a>" Mark gives very much the same facts in this respect.<a name=291:14></a> In John, we shall soon see, it is not a question of sufferings, either in Gethsemane, or upon the cross; it is the Son of God who gives Himself.<a name=291:15></a> In Luke we have more human anguish in Gethsemane, but none upon the cross.<a name=291:16></a> We will speak further on of what is related in John's Gospel.<a name=291:17></a> In Matthew's Gospel it is simple: it is the Lamb led to the slaughter, the Lamb that opened not His mouth, except to own Himself such, and forsaken of God for us.<a name=291:18></a> In Luke, I see the Son of man, and each circumstance answers to the character of the Gospel.<a name=291:19></a> Thus, as Man, His genealogy goes up to Adam; He is the Man who is always praying; in Gethsemane, in sight of the terrible cup that He had to drink, He is the Man realising beforehand that which He would have to suffer, as being made sin.<a name=291:20></a> He was in an agony (which is in Luke alone) but that only served to shew His perfection; He prayed the more earnestly; He was as a man with God; He went through all the anguish in His soul.<a name=291:21></a> Upon the cross, no sufferings at all.<a name=291:22></a> All the rest (that which we see in the other Gospels) remains true, but it is seen from another side; it is in another aspect that the precious Saviour is presented.<a name=291:23></a> The sufferings are past; He asks forgiveness for the Jews; He promises paradise to the thief; then, when all is finished, He gives up His spirit to His Father.<a name=291:24></a> It is grace and peace in His soul, when He has realised all.<a name=291:25></a> The forsaking of God had taken place, but this is not the side of the history that Luke presents.<a name=291:26></a>

		It is well to remark too, that the three other Gospels (Matthew, Mark, and Luke) relate His controversy with the different classes of the Jews at His last entrance into Jerusalem, the unbelief of whom is set in clear light.<a name=292:1></a> In John, when this unbelief as to His word (chapter 8), as to His works (chapter 9), has been made manifest, and He has declared that He is come to seek His sheep, Jews or Gentiles, and God has borne witness to Him as being Son of God, Son of David, and Son of man (but as such He must die), then it is not controversy with the Jews, a matter already settled, but communications to His disciples about the privileges and the position they should enjoy when He would be away.<a name=292:2></a> This brings us back to the history.<a name=292:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The few verses that tell us of Gethsemane, present to us the Saviour in His divine power, then giving Himself for His own, and finally perfect in obedience as man.<a name=292:4></a> Nothing is said of what passed before the arrival of Judas.<a name=292:5></a> but then the whole band, upon His voluntary avowal that He was Jesus of Nazareth, fall to the earth, confounded by the divine power which was revealed in Him.<a name=292:6></a> He could go away, to escape from them; but He was not come for that, and declaring again that He was the One whom they sought, He adds: "If therefore ye seek me, let these go their way"; that that word, so precious for us also, might be fulfilled: "Of those whom thou hast given me, I have lost none.<a name=292:7></a>" He puts Himself in the breach, that His own may be sheltered from harm.<a name=292:8></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In that which follows, we find, it seems to me, that Jesus hardly takes account of the high priest.<a name=293:4></a> He does not give account of His teaching to him, but refers him to those who had heard Him: what He had spoken was in public.<a name=293:5></a> In the other Gospels, we see indeed that Jesus replied, when He was asked who He was.<a name=293:6></a> But here the high priest's authority disappeared.<a name=293:7></a>

		Pilate would have liked to have left the matter to the Jews; he saw well that it was only envy and hatred without cause; but the Jews were to be the instrument of Christ's being treated as a malefactor, and not even stoned as a blasphemer, as Stephen was.<a name=293:14></a> In God's wonderful counsels, His Son was to be put to death as a malefactor among the Gentiles -- cast out of the vineyard, but the guilty ones, those who were the authors of it, were the Jews (verse 29-32, 35).<a name=293:15></a> What terrible blindness was theirs!<a name=293:16></a> They did not want to defile themselves that they might eat the passover (verse 28), at the very moment that they were giving up the true Passover Lamb to be sacrificed.<a name=293:17></a> Scruples are not conscience.<a name=293:18></a> We must not violate scruples, if we have them, but conscience looks to God and to His word.<a name=293:19></a> Conscience did not prevent the Jews buying the blood of Jesus for thirty pieces of silver; but a scruple forbade their putting into the treasury of God in the temple, the money rejected by Judas, because it was the price of blood.<a name=293:20></a> (Compare Romans 14.<a name=293:21></a>)

	<div class="paragraph">
		In reality the judgment of the Saviour has been pronounced.<a name=295:8></a> He had been give up to the outrages of the Roman soldiers.<a name=295:9></a> The details of this part of the history are found in Matthew 26: 24-31.<a name=295:10></a> The Jews, notwithstanding Pilate's timid resistance, had chosen Barabbas the robber and rejected the Son of God; and Pilate, yielding to their solicitation, had given up in an unprecedented way his position as judge, to please a turbulent people.<a name=295:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But he was not easy.<a name=295:12></a> The majesty of the ways of Jesus gave the accused ascendency over the judge.<a name=295:13></a> There was in Christ something superhuman that made Pilate afraid; besides, we know that he had received warnings that God had sent to him in a way such as a Gentile could receive them; Matthew 27: 19.<a name=295:14></a> But the relations of the Jews, not with Christ -- that is found more clearly and in a more terrible manner in Matthew -- but with Gentiles, and those of the Gentiles with God, were to be manifested with more evidence.<a name=295:15></a> Pilate brings Jesus back, and He is presented to us hated and rejected of the Jews, and condemned solely by Pilate upon words known to all: "Behold the Man.<a name=295:16></a>"

		From that moment, Pilate seeks to deliver Jesus; but to avoid a tumult amongst the Jews who reproach him with being unfaithful to Caesar, since Jesus called Himself King, he resists no longer, but irritated, he derides the Jews whom he despised, and not concerning himself as to either the truth or as to Jesus, says, "Shall I crucify your King?<a name=296:6></a>" -- hiding thus his uneasiness, his vexation, his weakness, and want of conscience.<a name=296:7></a> This is the occasion of the public apostasy of the Jews, who declare, "We have no king but Caesar!<a name=296:8></a>" The counsels of God are being fulfilled; Pilate's hands are stained with the blood of the Son of God; the Gentiles who had the authority, are guilty of His death; the Jews abandon all the privileges that they had from God, and Jesus, with His innocence judicially owned, occupies alone the place of truth and faithfulness, and gives Himself up (for He might have escaped as in the garden, or indeed at any moment) to fulfil the counsels of grace.<a name=296:9></a> The Gentiles are compromised without resource, the Jews lost for ever upon the ground of their own responsibility, and that not only as to the law, but as having renounced all right to the enjoyment of the promises; and if God fulfil them later on for His own glory, they will be compelled to receive the enjoyment of them as poor lost sinners from among the Gentiles.<a name=296:10></a> Jesus, condemned purely and simply for the testimony that He bore to the truth, as had also been the case before the high priest, stands alone in His dignity and integrity in the midst of a world that ruined itself in running counter to Him, to the grace and truth come from God by Him who was in His bosom.<a name=296:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In this chapter, the history of the resurrection, or rather of the manifestations of the Lord to His own, is full of interest and of important principles.<a name=300:15></a> The first person who is presented to us is not even the Christ: it is those who were to surround Him spiritually, and who had in fact surrounded Him down here.<a name=300:16></a> It was good and suitable that the state of their affections -- and affections nourish faith -- that this state, I say, as confidence in Him and attachment to His Person should be manifested, and that then He, revealed in resurrection, should be the answer to this state, and should lead them on further.<a name=300:17></a>

		The first person that presents herself, and whose history is of profound and touching interest, is Mary Magdalene.<a name=301:1></a> Her name has become the expression of a bad life, or at least that of a woman come out of licentiousness, but there is nothing to justify the tradition.<a name=301:2></a> But that she had been completely under the power of the demon is no tradition; the Lord had cast seven demons out of her.<a name=301:3></a> Her state therefore had been most miserable, and she loved much.<a name=301:4></a> We find her with a woman constantly called "the other Mary" (Matthew 23: 1), accompanying the Lord with others, and rendering Him the assiduous services of a devoted affection.<a name=301:5></a> But sincere as the affection of these women was for the Saviour, it was more so for the heart of Mary Magdalene than for all the others.<a name=301:6></a> They were fully prepared, buying aromatic spices and perfumes to embalm Him, to do all that was necessary to honour their Master; but Mary Magdalene thought of Him.<a name=301:7></a> They waited therefore the suitable time, and arrived at the sepulchre at sunrise.<a name=301:8></a> But Mary Magdalene's heart was devoid of everything save the grief of having lost Him whom she loved so much, and she was at the sepulchre whilst it was still night.<a name=301:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord was already risen, and the great stone rolled away from before the entrance into the sepulchre.<a name=301:10></a> She did not seize the import of what she saw, but went to Peter and John.<a name=301:11></a> These, to see what had happened, ran to the sepulchre that was supposed to be carefully guarded.<a name=301:12></a> John looks into the sepulchre and sees the linen clothes in which Jesus had been wrapped, left there upon the ground.<a name=301:13></a> Peter, arriving directly after, enters in and sees the linen clothes also, and the napkin in which the Lord's head had been wrapped, folded apart.<a name=301:14></a> All bespoke tranquillity; nothing indicated haste or precipitation.<a name=301:15></a> It seems that Peter was astonished at what he saw (Luke 24: 12), and hardly knew what to think of it.<a name=301:16></a> Then John, in his turn, entered; he saw and believed, but his faith rested upon what he saw, and not upon the word.<a name=301:17></a> They knew not the scriptures which declared that thus it must be.<a name=301:18></a> Alas!<a name=301:19></a> Jesus did not possess their heart, nor the word their understanding.<a name=301:20></a> They go <i>to their own home</i>; they look no further; they are astonished, John at least convinced; divine intelligence did not enlighten them, affection for Christ did not move them: they went to their own home.<a name=301:21></a>

		It is not thus with Mary Magdalene.<a name=302:1></a> For her without Jesus the whole world was nothing but an empty sepulchre; her heart was more empty still.<a name=302:2></a> She stays there at the sepulchre, where the Lord whom she loved had been.<a name=302:3></a> As it is said of Rachel; she could not be comforted, because He was no more.<a name=302:4></a> Stooping down into the sepulchre hewn in the rock, she sees two angels, who ask her: "Why weepest thou?<a name=302:5></a>" God allows the full expression of this strong affection.<a name=302:6></a> It is no longer, "They have taken away <i>the</i> Lord," as she said to the apostles, but, "They have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.<a name=302:7></a>" But Jesus was not far from a heart thus attached to His Person.<a name=302:8></a> Mary hears someone moving behind her.<a name=302:9></a> She turns and sees a man whom she takes for the gardener.<a name=302:10></a> He asks again: "Why weepest thou?<a name=302:11></a> whom seekest thou?<a name=302:12></a>" Then we see the affection that appropriates to itself the lost Saviour, as if He belonged to her, and that does not imagine that the gardener can think of any other object than that which occupies it.<a name=302:13></a> "Lord," she says, "if thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.<a name=302:14></a>" If I had a sick friend, I should ask at his house, "How is he?<a name=302:15></a>" and all would understand what I meant, of whom I was speaking.<a name=302:16></a> Mary supposes that everybody thinks of the Lord, as she does herself, and that her affection gives her full right to dispose of Him.<a name=302:17></a> It was not intelligence; He had said that He would rise again, and she sought among the dead Him who was living.<a name=302:18></a> But the Lord was everything for her heart.<a name=302:19></a> It is what Jesus seeks, and He makes Himself found as living.<a name=302:20></a> He acts in His divine and human affection, and calls His sheep by her name; "Mary," He says.<a name=302:21></a> This was enough, and a single word from a satisfied heart answers to the call.<a name=302:22></a> His sheep hears His voice, and mistakes it not.<a name=302:23></a> "Rabboni!<a name=302:24></a>" she says.<a name=302:25></a> That was all; Mary had found Him, and found Him living, and He had brought out in Mary's heart all the affection which His love would satisfy.<a name=302:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now intelligence comes, and it is Mary, she who sought the living among the dead, but with a heart that belonged to Him, a heart attached to His Person, she it is whom the Lord employs to communicate to the apostles themselves the knowledge of the highest privileges that belong to Christians.<a name=302:27></a> We see clearly the importance of this devotedness.<a name=302:28></a> It was not knowledge that characterised Mary, but her affection brought her spiritually near to the Lord, and made her the fitting vessel for communicating what He Himself had in His heart.<a name=302:29></a> She possessed, as a vessel, this knowledge, but better still, she possessed the Lord.<a name=302:30></a>

		As to her position, Mary Magdalene represented the Jewish remnant attached to the Person of the Lord, but ignorant of the glorious counsels of God.<a name=303:1></a> She thought to have found Jesus again, risen no doubt, but come again into this world to take the place that was due to Him, and satisfy the affections of those who had left everything for Him in the days of His humiliation, despised of the world, and denied by His people.<a name=303:2></a> But she could not have Him thus now.<a name=303:3></a> A glory far more excellent, of far greater extent, was in the thoughts of God, and blessing for us far more precious.<a name=303:4></a> In receiving Christ, she could not rightly receive Him, but according to the thoughts of God with regard to the Saviour.<a name=303:5></a> Only her attachment to the Lord opened this blessed path to her.<a name=303:6></a> "Touch me not," the Lord says, "for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God.<a name=303:7></a>" She could not have the Lord, even when risen, as come again as Messiah upon earth.<a name=303:8></a> He must first of all ascend to His Father and receive the kingdom, then return: but there was much more.<a name=303:9></a> A work had been accomplished that placed Him, as Man and Son always, with the Father in glory, Man in this blessed relationship; but it was a work of redemption that set His own, redeemed according to the value of that work, in the same glory and in the same relationships as Himself.<a name=303:10></a> And this was based upon the sure foundation of that work, in which God Himself and the Father had been fully glorified, and had made themselves known according to all their perfections.<a name=303:11></a> (Compare John 13: 31, 32 and chapter 17: 4, 5.<a name=303:12></a>) According to these perfections, the disciples are introduced into the position and according to the relationship of Jesus Himself with God.<a name=303:13></a> This was the necessary fruit of the work of Jesus; without this, He would not have seen of the travail of His soul.<a name=303:14></a>

		Mary having communicated these things to the apostles, the course of the outward development founded upon this revelation, is related.<a name=304:4></a> The disciples met that same day in the evening, and Jesus, the doors being shut because of their fear of the Jews, appeared personally, but in a spiritual body, in their midst, bringing them the peace that He had made by His blood.<a name=304:5></a> Divine peace, the gathering together, and the presence of the Lord, characterised their meeting.<a name=304:6></a> The apostles were to be eye-witnesses, and He shews them His hands and His side, irrefutable evidence that it was truly the same Jesus they had known, and they rejoice when they see Him.<a name=304:7></a> Then they were to be His missionaries or apostles (sent ones), and He lays down divine peace as the point of departure: "Peace be to you," He says to them; "as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you.<a name=304:8></a>" Then, as God breathed into Adam's nostrils the breath of life, the divine Son, the same God -- here a risen Man -- breathes upon them, communicating to them the Holy Ghost.<a name=304:9></a> Although symbolising the gift of the Holy Ghost, He was not yet sent, for Jesus was not yet ascended on high; but He was communicated as power of life by the risen Saviour, divine life -- life according to the position in which He was, and which was its power.<a name=304:10></a> They lived by the divine life of the Saviour, and according to the state He had taken in rising.<a name=304:11></a> The Holy Ghost, descended from heaven, was to reveal to them the objects of faith, and lead them.<a name=304:12></a> Here, that which they receive is the spiritual and subjective capacity to enjoy them, making them personally capable of running the race in which the Holy Ghost was to lead them.<a name=304:13></a> They were fit for the service of their mission: He who should guide them was the Holy Ghost, who was going to descend from heaven.<a name=304:14></a>

		Verses 19-23 of our chapter resume the position of service, in which the Lord places His disciples, as well as the gathering together of the children of God.<a name=305:10></a> Notice here that He said, in His life upon earth before resurrection, "Fear not": and if, as Immanuel, the Messiah, He disposed of everything in favour of His own when He sent out His disciples, here, on the contrary, they fear the Jews, and the Lord does not take away that fear, but replaces the power of His presence as Emmanuel the Messiah, by His presence in their midst, and by the peace He had made and that He conferred.<a name=305:11></a>

		Thomas was not there.<a name=305:12></a> Eight days after, that is to say, on the following Lord's day, Thomas was with the others, and Jesus came into their midst.<a name=305:13></a> Responding to the doubts that Thomas had expressed before Jesus came, the Lord convinced him, by shewing him and making him touch His hands and His side.<a name=305:14></a> Thomas's doubts disappear.<a name=305:15></a> It is the expression, in this remarkable <i>resume</i> or sketch of the dispensations of God, of the position of the Jewish remnant in the last days.<a name=305:16></a> They will believe when they see Him, and Jesus makes the difference between believers who have not seen Him -- our position -- and those who will believe when they see Him.<a name=305:17></a> The blessing rests upon us.<a name=305:18></a> Thomas's confession, true and just as it was, shews, it seems to me, the Jewish position.<a name=305:19></a> It is not the glorified Son of man, Jesus on high, but it is what the Jews will own when He returns; that is to say, that the Jesus whom they had rejected was their Lord and their God, their Deliverer and Saviour, the Jehovah who was to deliver them.<a name=305:20></a> The testimony of the others will not have convinced them.<a name=305:21></a> They will see and look upon Him whom they have pierced.<a name=305:22></a> Thus we find, in this chapter, besides the resurrection of Jesus, the epitome of the dispensation of grace from that event up to the Saviour's return: first of all the Jewish remnant, represented by Mary Magdalene, but introduced by a risen Christ into the knowledge of the Christian position and privileges -- privileges that she announces to the disciples.<a name=305:23></a> Following upon this communication, the assembled disciples find the Lord Jesus in their midst, pronouncing upon them the peace that He had just made: then He sends them forth, founding their mission on the peace given, and putting in their hands the administration of the forgiveness of sins, communicating the Holy Ghost to them.<a name=305:24></a> Finally, the Jewish remnant at the end, which believes when it sees, but which does not enjoy the same privileges as those who believe during His absence, at a time when we do not see.<a name=305:25></a> Thomas (the remnant) would not receive the testimony that had been borne to him of the resurrection of Jesus.<a name=305:26></a>

		In Romans it is not a question of the <i>counsels</i> of God, except in three or four verses of chapter 8, and then only to prove that the work of His grace is unchangeable, and that, when once it has been appropriated by the call of grace, it is stable and sure, and is carried on until the glory.<a name=310:6></a> The work of Christ is accomplished, and those who believe in Him will be conformed to His image.<a name=310:7></a> Thus all is perfectly secure.<a name=310:8></a> Possessing the life of Christ, so that we suffer with Him, we shall be also glorified with Him.<a name=310:9></a> The epistle contains nothing more relative to the counsels of God.<a name=310:10></a> If we want to learn about them we must turn to the Epistle to the Ephesians; while the Epistle to the Colossians instructs us as to the life of a man who to faith is risen.<a name=310:11></a> But in Romans we find the work of God in grace for the justification of the ungodly by the death and resurrection of Christ, and their acceptance in Christ, believers being looked at as in Him.<a name=310:12></a>

		As already intimated above, the doctrine of the Epistle to the Romans divides into two parts, the first of which, up to chapter 5: 11, treats of <i>sins</i>, the putting away of these, and the grace of God therein unfolded.<a name=310:13></a> From thence up to the end of chapter 8, the second part is taken up; namely, <i>sin in the flesh</i>, the condition in which we are found consequent on Adam's sin, as well as our deliverance from the same, and our new condition in Christ.<a name=310:14></a> Then follow as an appendix three chapters explaining how the doctrine of the universal condition of sin in which man is found, and of the reconciliation by faith of all with God, can be compatible with the special promises made to the Jews.<a name=310:15></a> The conclusion is made up of exhortations and the rehearsal of certain important principles.<a name=310:16></a> The exposition of the doctrine of the reconciliation of man with God by faith, contained in the first part of the epistle is introduced by a preface in which the gospel is founded on the Person of Christ, and is presented as the revelation of the righteousness of God.<a name=310:17></a>

		We see then in this epistle how God has met us in perfect grace, when, according to our responsibility as men and according to His righteousness, we were totally lost; how out of pure grace He has provided for us salvation and eternal life, when we were alienated from Him by sin; yea, when, according to the flesh, we were in enmity against Him.<a name=311:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But before considering more closely the doctrine of the epistle, and the order and contents of its different parts, we may say a word about the apostle himself.<a name=311:2></a> He had never been at Rome; but, endued with divine authority, he was the apostle of all the Gentiles, and for this reason he could write to the Romans, although he had not been the instrument of their conversion.<a name=311:3></a> Some of them, indeed, he knew, for Rome itself being the metropolis of the known world, people from all countries met there.<a name=311:4></a> This, however, gives a special character to the epistle, different from that of most of his other writings.<a name=311:5></a> It is more of a treatise than a letter from the apostle to one of the assemblies founded by himself.<a name=311:6></a> Personal relations are omitted to leave room for positive doctrine, although at the close of the epistle Paul salutes many saints whom he knew, as at its commencement he sought to establish a link of affection with the Christians at Rome; still his <i>apostleship is</i> primarily the basis of his communications to the believers at Rome.<a name=311:7></a> No apostle had founded the assembly at Rome.<a name=311:8></a> Paul had not yet been there; and if later on Peter went there to offer up his life in testimony for the Lord, until then he had had nothing to do with Rome, being the apostle of the circumcision.<a name=311:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul begins the epistle with a reference to his office.<a name=312:1></a> He was the servant of Jesus Christ, a called apostle, separated unto the gospel of God; that is, so to speak, his title.<a name=312:2></a> He served the Lord, and to this end he had been called and separated, in quite a special way; he was not amongst those who had followed the Lord on earth; he did not know Him thus.<a name=312:3></a> On the contrary, he had been the most violent enemy to the name of Jesus on earth, and sought to exterminate this new doctrine -- that is, faith in Jesus -- from the midst of Israel, and to punish every adherent of it.<a name=312:4></a> This path was put a stop to by the Lord, who revealed Himself to him in glory, and now this very glory became the starting-point of Paul's service.<a name=312:5></a> It was the most signal proof of the work of reconciliation being accomplished, that He who had suffered for sins was now in glory; and not only that, but the persecuted Christians were acknowledged by the Lord, not as disciples, but as united to Him -- the glorified Man, the Son of God in heaven.<a name=312:6></a> Thus Paul was <i>called</i> in an entirely special way; but he was separated also in a special way.<a name=312:7></a> The revelation of the Lord in glory separated him first of all from Judaism, yet not that he should turn to paganism; but, acknowledging Christ in divine glory as Lord, he was taken out "from amongst the people and the Gentiles" (Acts 26: 17), and was sent into the world by the glorified Man, the Lord of glory, to proclaim an accomplished redemption, to deliver from sin all who should believe in Him, and the Jews from the yoke of the law.<a name=312:8></a> Therefore, henceforth, he knew no one after the flesh, not even the Lord Jesus; that is, not as the carnally-minded Jews desired to have Him here in the world, as Son of David, although fully recognising that He had come as such, and that He had a perfect right to this title.<a name=312:9></a> But the Lord had been rejected as Son of David, and now all should be pure <i>grace</i>, as well for the Jews as for the Gentiles, since the first had lost every title to the <i>promises</i> through their rejection of Him in whom they should have their fulfilment.<a name=312:10></a> God will assuredly make good His promises; but now all is of pure grace, and, through the risen Man, whom Paul had seen in glory.<a name=312:11></a> This point is clearly established further on in the epistle.<a name=312:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		For the better understanding of the epistle, it may be well to remark, that Paul, although the Lord Jesus in glory was the starting-point and foundation of his ministry, goes no further in the doctrine of this epistle than the <i>resurrection</i> of the Lord.<a name=312:13></a> It is quite true that the position of the Lord in glory is assumed, and in the few verses which set forth the order of the counsels of God, the glory of the children of God is also not wanting; it is part of these counsels that the elect should be conformed to the image of His Son (chapter 8: 29, 30).<a name=312:14></a> Nevertheless, when the apostle speaks of the groundwork of salvation, how one is justified and saved, he goes no farther than the Lord's resurrection; for what Christ has <i>acquired</i> for us is another thing from the answer to the question, How can a sinner be accepted by God, and how is he brought into the position of an heir of God?<a name=312:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=313>[Page 313]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the Epistle to the Romans we find precisely this position of the heir, as made fit in Christ to stand before God, and to inherit with Christ as man, according to righteousness, as a new quickened man accepted by God; but the glory and the inheritance itself are mentioned but briefly.<a name=313:1></a> As soon as Christ, as a dead man, had been raised, <i>man</i> was brought into an entirely new condition, quickened according to the power of the Spirit and of resurrection.<a name=313:2></a> The work which abolished sin had been accomplished; our sins had been borne and made an end of by death; God had been glorified in the place where sin was; the strength of him who had the power of death had been annulled, even as death itself.<a name=313:3></a> There was a new man over whom death had no power.<a name=313:4></a> I do not speak here of the Person of Christ, of what He was in His nature, but of the new position of men into which we are brought by the resurrection of the man Christ Jesus -- of man in his new condition according to the counsels of God.<a name=313:5></a> It is there that we see the proof of the acceptance of the finished work of Christ according to the righteousness of God, as well as the pattern, if not yet of the glory, still of the normal condition of every believer in Christ.<a name=313:6></a> They are, so to speak, on the other side of death -- of Satan's power, sin, and the judgment of God -- because God had been perfectly glorified in Christ: they stand in the favour of God according to righteousness.<a name=313:7></a> That is the importance of the resurrection of Christ as the fundamental doctrine of this epistle, His death being presented as the basis of His resurrection, and that which gives to the latter its value -- "Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again.<a name=313:8></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus Paul was called and separated from all men to preach the glad tidings of God, the message of this work of His love.<a name=313:9></a> This gospel had already been promised beforehand by the prophets in holy scripture, but now the announcement was no longer a promise.<a name=313:10></a> We have, it is true, precious promises for the path we must tread through this world, but the gospel is no promise.<a name=313:11></a> It is rather the <i>fulfilment</i> of the promises of God, in so far as they relate to the Lord's incarnation, His finished work, His resurrection (1 Peter 1: 11, 12), and to His being glorified, although this last point is not treated in the Epistle to the Romans.<a name=313:12></a> It should be observed here that the "holy scriptures" are the promises of God, and that the prophets by whom they were given are prophets of God.<a name=313:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=314>[Page 314]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In what, then, do these glad tidings consist?<a name=314:1></a> They are "concerning his Son" (the Son of God), "Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=314:2></a>" The Person of Christ is the primary subject of the gospel; it announces His having come into the world.<a name=314:3></a> But here we have two things: First, the promises are fulfilled; inasmuch as He is Son of David according to the flesh; secondly, He is "marked out Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by resurrection of the dead.<a name=314:4></a>" These are the two great accomplished facts which constitute for man the value of the coming of the Lord into the world.<a name=314:5></a> The promises are fulfilled; the Son of David was there.<a name=314:6></a> The Jews would not receive Him, and have thus lost the fruit of the promises, although these had their accomplishment, inasmuch as the Lord had come.<a name=314:7></a> But then the power of God has been revealed in the fact that the Lord, after having submitted Himself to death, has by resurrection been proved to be Son of God.<a name=314:8></a> Although the strongest proof of the power of God has been given in Christ's resurrection, yet we see already in the raising of Lazarus a manifestation of this divine power, as well as later on in the resurrection of all saints.<a name=314:9></a> "This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby," John 11: 4.<a name=314:10></a> He was, and is, the resurrection and the life.<a name=314:11></a> The power of resurrection is the proof that He is Son of God.<a name=314:12></a> This is not a fulfilment of promises, but the power of God there, where death had intervened as the consequence of sin.<a name=314:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With regard to the expression, "the Spirit of holiness," I would notice that the Holy Spirit is, so to speak, the operative power in the resurrection as in everything that God has created or done.<a name=314:14></a> Thus Peter says, with regard to the Lord's resurrection, "Put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit" (1 Peter 3: 18); and of the believer it is said, "But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you," Romans 8: 11.<a name=314:15></a> But why is it spoken of as "according to the Spirit of holiness"?<a name=314:16></a> Because the Holy Spirit is, as it were, the operative power of God for producing in man all that is well-pleasing to Him.<a name=314:17></a> This power is, of course, always in God.<a name=314:18></a> By it He created the world; by it He wrought in the instruments of the Old Testament and in the prophets.<a name=314:19></a> But now He had been acting in the human life of Christ, and in the production of the new form of humanity, according to this divine power.<a name=314:20></a> The prophets uttered what was given them to say, and with that the divine inspiration ceased; besides, what they announced was not for themselves.<a name=314:21></a> John the Baptist was filled with the Holy Spirit from his mother's womb.<a name=314:22></a> But Christ as Man was born of the Holy Spirit; His life, though human in every respect, was the expression of the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=314:23></a> He cast out devils by the Holy Spirit.<a name=314:24></a> His words were spirit and life.<a name=314:25></a> The fulness of the Godhead dwelt in Him bodily, but His humanity was the expression of that which was divine by the Holy Spirit, in love, in power, and specially in holiness.<a name=314:26></a> He was the Holy One of God.<a name=314:27></a> By the Holy Spirit He offered Himself without spot to God.<a name=314:28></a> In all things He served His Father; but His service was the perfect presentation of what was divine, of the Father Himself, in the midst of men -- He, as to His humanity, by the Spirit, at every moment answering to the Godhead, the expression and effulgence of it without spot or blemish.<a name=314:29></a> All the offerings of the Old Testament are types of Christ; but in this connection the meat-offering is the corresponding and most striking type.<a name=314:30></a> Cakes of fine flour, unleavened, mingled with oil, anointed with oil, parted in pieces, and oil poured upon them.<a name=314:31></a> What a striking type of the humanity of Christ, which, as to its nature, was of the Spirit, and anointed with the Spirit, every part being characterised by the outpoured Spirit, and by which all the incense of His perfections was offered up to God as a sweet-smelling savour!<a name=314:32></a> So He had to be tried by fire, in death, to shew that all was a sweet savour, and nothing else.<a name=314:33></a> Finally, the power of the Holy Spirit was shewn in the greatest and most perfect way in the Lord's resurrection.<a name=314:34></a> Being put to death in the flesh, He was quickened by the Spirit.<a name=314:35></a> The Spirit, who in divine power had been energetic in His birth, and in His whole life, and by whom He at length offered Himself to God, manifested all His power in quickening Jesus from death.<a name=314:36></a> It is true indeed that He was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father; also that He Himself raised up His body, the temple of God (John 2: 19); but the Holy Spirit was the immediate agent in His resurrection (1 Peter 3: 18); the body also of the risen One is a <i>spiritual body</i>.<a name=314:37></a>

		Thus man has been brought by resurrection in the Person of Christ into an entirely new condition, beyond death, sin, judgment, and the power of Satan; and it was thus that Christ was proved to be the Son of God according to the Spirit of holiness by resurrection.<a name=316:1></a> This Spirit was the power of holiness throughout His whole life; for "by the eternal Spirit he offered himself without spot to God," and according to this Spirit He is proved to be Son of God, and by Him was, even on earth, justified.<a name=316:2></a> As all was accomplished for God's glory by a man, who was the Son of God, and who, as man, had manifested His perfect obedience and love to His Father, man, according to the value of this accomplished work and the quickening power of the Holy Spirit, has been brought into an entirely new position in the Person of the Son of God, so that by faith <i>we</i> are accepted and are <i>sons</i>.<a name=316:3></a> Christ, who, as Son of David, was the fulfilment of the Old Testament promises, being rejected on earth, after He had accomplished the work entrusted to Him by the Father, entered as the risen One, beyond death which He endured as the fruit of sin, into the position of the second Man, the last Adam.<a name=316:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we have here presented in the Person of Christ the two main points in the ways of God -- the fulfilment of promise (although the Jews by His rejection have lost all right to it), and the revelation of the Son of God, proved to be such according to the quickening power of the Holy Spirit in a risen Man.<a name=316:5></a> Thus the power of God is manifested, not in the fulfilment of a promise, but in the present life and position of the second Man in connection with an accomplished redemption.<a name=316:6></a> But here the divine power of life and the new position brought about by resurrection are specially connected with the relationship of man to God, as put into this position, yet in the Person of the Lord Himself in power.<a name=316:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How blessed is the thought, that the eternal Son of God, become Man, has taken up this new position of which we have spoken, and that, as pattern and Firstborn among many <i>brethren</i>, who will be perfectly like Him according to the living power of the Holy Spirit, and in the glory itself.<a name=316:8></a> "For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren," Hebrews 2: 11.<a name=316:9></a> The subject here, indeed, is not the glory; but the Lord could say, after His resurrection, when all was accomplished (not before), "Go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father, and unto my God, and your God," John 20: 17.<a name=316:10></a>

		Thus the subject of the gospel, to which Paul was separated, is Jesus Christ our Lord as Son of David for the fulfilment of the promises, and declared to be Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by resurrection from the dead.<a name=317:1></a> It is true, the apostle speaks in this epistle of righteousness, and sets forth all clearly and fully; but the principal object which he has in view is the Person of Christ Himself, and what He is as the fulfilment of the promises and as Son of God in power and in resurrection -- that which the Holy Spirit presents as God's own object in the gospel.<a name=317:2></a> From Him, as already glorified, Paul had received grace and apostleship, for obedience of faith among all the nations for His name.<a name=317:3></a> The Romans were amongst these nations.<a name=317:4></a> He does not address them as an assembly, as he usually did when writing to an assembly he had founded, but he addresses his epistle to all the beloved of God, called saints, which are in Rome.<a name=317:5></a> As apostle of the Gentiles, he could write to all with the authority of Christ.<a name=317:6></a>

		The apostle would have wished to visit the Christians at Rome sooner, but had been hindered by Satan; for the work of the Lord is always pursued in presence of the enemy, who seeks to stay its progress, be it through persecution, or through stirring up evil in the assemblies, with which the labourer must be occupied; be it through heresies, which absorb his time, or through all sorts of other devices.<a name=317:10></a> It is important for the labourer to observe this.<a name=317:11></a> He thereby learns dependence, and that the strength and energy of <i>the Lord</i> are absolutely needed.<a name=317:12></a> Therefore Paul, while giving thanks to God for the faith of the believers at Rome, which was spoken of in all the world, besought in his prayers that God would open his way to them.<a name=317:13></a> He longed to see them, that he might impart unto them some spiritual gift, to the end that they might be established; but in the same breath he takes his place in love among them, by saying, "That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.<a name=317:14></a>" He was an apostle, and should act in love; as an apostle then, he should come down to the weakest, to raise them up to divine confidence.<a name=317:15></a> Often he had purposed coming to them, that he might have some fruit among them also.<a name=317:16></a> He was under obligation to all nations to bring the grace of God to them; and so, as far as depended on him, he was ready to preach the gospel to <i>them also that were at Rome</i>.<a name=317:17></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This leads the apostle to the doctrine of the epistle.<a name=318:4></a> He was ready to preach to those who were at Rome because he was not ashamed of the gospel; "for," said he, "it is the power of <i>God</i> unto salvation, to every one that believeth.<a name=318:5></a>" Power of man it is not -- this he explains afterwards still more distinctly and fully -- not even for acquiring <i>human</i> righteousness.<a name=318:6></a> It is a salvation <i>brought</i> to man -- a holy, a righteous salvation -- but a salvation from God, by <i>the power of God</i>, and this, because the righteousness of <i>God</i> was therein revealed, in contrast to <i>human</i> righteousness.<a name=318:7></a> It is God's own righteousness in which we participate by faith; His righteousness on the principle of <i>faith</i>.<a name=318:8></a> All as to it is already perfect, before we believe in it.<a name=318:9></a> By faith we have part in it.<a name=318:10></a> This righteousness is not by the works of man, nor by the law, else it would be only for the Jews, who alone had the law.<a name=318:11></a> It avails rather for all men, because it is by faith, and so the Gentiles, if they believe, have part in it.<a name=318:12></a>

		It will perhaps be of use to say a word as to the meaning of the expression, "Righteousness of God.<a name=318:13></a>" Although it is quite simple, much misapprehension prevails as to its meaning.<a name=318:14></a> The Lutheran translation has instead, "The righteousness which avails before God.<a name=318:15></a>" Now man's righteousness, according to the law, avails before God; none such may be found, it is true, but it avails before God; but it is not the righteousness of God, were it ever so perfect.<a name=318:16></a> In John 16: 10 we see wherein the righteousness of God has been shewn; namely, that God has set Christ at His right hand in His own glory, because Christ has perfectly glorified Him.<a name=318:17></a> The righteousness consists in this, that the Father has exalted Christ as Man to His own glory -- the glory which He had with Him before the world was; and God, as a <i>righteous</i> God, has glorified Him because <i>He</i> has been glorified in Christ on the cross; John 17: 5; chapter 13: 31, 32.<a name=318:18></a> In the above-cited passage (John 16: 10), the Lord says: The Spirit "will convince the world of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more.<a name=318:19></a>" By the rejection of Christ, the world has for ever lost Him as come in grace; but God has accepted and glorified Him.<a name=318:20></a> When the Lord speaks of the world, in John 17: 25, He says, "<i>Righteous</i> Father!<a name=318:21></a>" on the other hand, in His prayer for His own, He says, "Holy Father!<a name=318:22></a>" (verse 11).<a name=318:23></a> Thus the proof of the righteousness of God lies in His having glorified Christ.<a name=318:24></a> When God was in Christ in the world, it had either to accept or reject Him.<a name=318:25></a> It has rejected Him, and is thereby judged, and will see Him no more until He come in judgment; but Christ, as Man, has perfectly glorified <i>God</i> in all that He is, and God according to His righteousness has glorified <i>Him</i>.<a name=318:26></a> Now the gospel announces this righteousness of God; namely, that Christ, in what He has done for us, having glorified God, has been glorified as Man, and is seated at God's right hand, clothed with divine glory; moreover, that our position before God is the consequence of what Christ has accomplished.<a name=318:27></a> Our justification and being glorified are a part of the righteousness of God; because what Christ has done to glorify God, has been done for us.<a name=318:28></a> We are the righteousness of God in Him; 2 Corinthians 5: 21.<a name=318:29></a> Christ would lose the fruit of His work if we should not be with Him in glory as the fruit of the travail of His soul, after He has glorified all that is in God, although in ourselves we are absolutely unworthy.<a name=318:30></a>

		The apostle then sets forth why such a righteousness, the righteousness of God Himself, was necessary, if man was to be saved.<a name=319:1></a> Human righteousness was not to be found on earth, and yet righteousness was necessary.<a name=319:2></a> But since it is God's righteousness, and certainly not by our works, it must be reckoned to us through faith, on the principle of faith; for if the <i>works</i> of man contributed towards it, it would not be the righteousness of <i>God</i>.<a name=319:3></a> But if it is through faith man participates in this righteousness, then believers from amongst the nations had part in it just as much as the Jews.<a name=319:4></a>

		We see, then, that as the Person of Christ was placed in the foreground as the first, the second main subject of the epistle is <i>the righteousness of God</i> revealed upon the principle of faith, so that it is for <i>all</i>, and to be received through faith, and thus appropriated by the soul.<a name=320:1></a> What made this righteousness necessary is the universal sinfulness of man, for the wrath of God has been revealed against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who possess the truth in unrighteousness.<a name=320:2></a> With regard to the heathen, the apostle gives two reasons for this wrath.<a name=320:3></a> First, the testimony of creation (vers.<a name=320:4></a> 19, 20); and, secondly, that, knowing God, they did not wish to retain Him in their knowledge but preferred idolatry (verse 21-24).<a name=320:5></a> For the invisible things of Him are seen, that is, His eternal power and Godhead, perceived by the things that are made from the creation of the world; so that what can be known of God is manifested among them, and consequently they are without excuse (verse 20).<a name=320:6></a> This does not imply that they know God according to His nature, but that they should have known Him as <i>Creator</i>; unless one is blind, a Creator is seen in the creation.<a name=320:7></a>

		But God has not only revealed Himself as Creator.<a name=320:8></a> Noah did not only know Him as such, but also as a God with whom man as a responsible being had to do, as a God who had judged the world for its wickedness, who took note of man's ways, and who would not have unrighteousness and violence.<a name=320:9></a> At the building of the tower of Babel they had learnt to know Him as a God who had scattered them, because they desired to become independent in their own wisdom, and powerful in their own strength.<a name=320:10></a> Such a God, however, the heathen would not retain in their knowledge or acknowledge; they made themselves gods such as man could make, gods which favoured their passions; and instead of glorifying the true God, or being thankful to Him, they relapsed into the darkness of their own hearts.<a name=320:11></a> "Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, and changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like unto corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things.<a name=320:12></a>" And because they would not maintain the glory of God, but gave it up for their lusts, God gave them over to these lusts.<a name=320:13></a> He gave them up to shameful passions in which they did things unbecoming nature itself, and filled with all ungodliness and controlled by their passions, they not only did such things themselves, but with deliberate wickedness they found pleasure in those that did them.<a name=320:14></a> There were, it is true, some who judged these infamous ways (chapter 2: 1), but they did the same, and thus condemned themselves, and became subject to the just judgment of God, while also they despised the riches of His goodness and patience, not perceiving that this goodness led them to repentance.<a name=320:15></a> Instead of yielding to this leading, with a stubborn and impenitent heart, they treasured up unto themselves wrath against the day of wrath.<a name=320:16></a>

		The apostle comes now to an important principle, simple indeed, but throwing clear light upon the whole subject.<a name=321:1></a> Now that God is revealed, He deals with man according to his actions.<a name=321:2></a> In the day of judgment He will render to every one according to his deeds, be he Jew or Greek; for there is no respect of persons with God.<a name=321:3></a> He had indeed chosen a people, and brought them near to Himself, to put man to the test, and to maintain the truth that there is but <i>one</i> God; but fundamentally there was no difference amongst men.<a name=321:4></a> All were sinners by nature, and all had sinned.<a name=321:5></a> We see also that God with regard to His people, although He had given them a law, always remained behind the veil without revealing Himself.<a name=321:6></a> But now the veil is rent, and man -- first the Jew and then the Greek -- must be manifested before Him, each one according to what he is in his walk and actual moral condition; and here there is no question whether his position be that of Jew or Greek.<a name=321:7></a> God, according to His righteousness, takes into account only the measure of light which each possesses.<a name=321:8></a> The apostle when he speaks of those who seek for glory and honour and immortality, supposes Christianity, for the knowledge of these things depends upon a revelation.<a name=321:9></a> God will give eternal life, without distinction between Jew or Greek, to those who by patient continuance in well-doing seek these things.<a name=321:10></a> God would have the reality of divine life, not a mere external form.<a name=321:11></a> Those who do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, must expect "indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile; but glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile.<a name=321:12></a>" All will be judged, every one according to his works, according to the light which he has possessed, without respect of persons.<a name=321:13></a> "For as many as have sinned without law, shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law, shall be judged by the law .<a name=321:14></a>.<a name=321:15></a>.<a name=321:16></a> .<a name=321:17></a> In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ.<a name=321:18></a>" "For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.<a name=321:19></a>" If one from the Gentiles does what the law requires, he is accepted, and has the advantage over one who possesses the law and does not observe it.<a name=321:20></a> As we have said, it is no longer a question, now that God has been revealed, of external relationships, according to which some are "near" and others "afar off," but of what is just in the sight of God.<a name=321:21></a> In reality, one of the Gentiles who in spirit walked in love, did that which the law commanded; while a Jew, who had the law and walked in sin, could not be accepted of God.<a name=321:22></a> It is no longer a question of outward relationship with God, of His government of the world and of His people -- in a word, of the government of God upon earth -- but of the condition of the soul before God, and of the day of judgment, when the secrets of the heart will be brought to light, and man will be judged according to his works.<a name=321:23></a>

		After the apostle has clearly laid down these great and important principles, he goes on to describe the actual condition of the Jews, as he had done with regard to the Gentiles in chapter 1.<a name=322:1></a> The Jews boasted of the law, and of the privileges they possessed; they knew the will of God, and were able to teach the ignorant; yea, they even boasted of God.<a name=322:2></a> But did they also teach <i>themselves</i>?<a name=322:3></a> On the contrary; they did all that which in their wisdom they taught others not to do.<a name=322:4></a> They dishonoured God whilst bearing His name.<a name=322:5></a> The one true God was blasphemed amongst the Gentiles through them, as it is written.<a name=322:6></a> They possessed privileges, but if the law to which those privileges belonged was broken, their circumcision became uncircumcision.<a name=322:7></a> And the Gentiles, if they observed the law, condemned those who, possessing the letter and circumcision, transgressed the law.<a name=322:8></a> For he was not a true Jew who was one outwardly, but he whose heart was circumcised, who was a Jew in heart and spirit, not in the letter; "whose praise is not of men, but of God.<a name=322:9></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle now begins to meet the Jews on their own ground.<a name=323:1></a> Their advantage was great; the profit of the circumcision was "much every way," chiefly because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.<a name=323:2></a> The apostle certainly believed this, and rightly.<a name=323:3></a> It is not a question, in this respect, of their all being individually converted; they enjoyed the privileges of the people of God which were nowhere else to be found; and if they did not believe, their unbelief could not set aside the faithfulness of God.<a name=323:4></a> (It is just the same now with professing Christianity.<a name=323:5></a>) The promises of God will be fulfilled through His faithfulness to His people Israel, although they have lost every right to them.<a name=323:6></a> But the apostle does not speak of this until later on (chapter 11).<a name=323:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, it might be said, man's unbelief, then, brings out only the more conspicuously the infallible faithfulness of God.<a name=323:8></a> And does not this fact of man's unbelief, causing the faithfulness of God to come out more plainly, do away with God's right to judge man?<a name=323:9></a> By no means; for according to this principle He could judge <i>no one</i>, because the wickedness of the nations also brings out His faithfulness all the more clearly.<a name=323:10></a> The Jews are just as responsible as the others for their unbelief, and that these would be judged the Jew did not in any way doubt.<a name=323:11></a> Thus, in spite of their privileges, the Jews also have fallen under the judgment of God.<a name=323:12></a> The apostle does not stoop to reply to the wicked insinuation of some -- "Let us do evil that good may come" -- but merely says, "Whose damnation is just.<a name=323:13></a>" Christians were, indeed, accused by the world of speaking thus.<a name=323:14></a> Grace is always the occasion of accusation, as long as the soul is not convinced of sin; but as soon as the conscience comes to the knowledge of sin, grace becomes the occasion of heartfelt gratitude.<a name=323:15></a>

		If, then, the Jew had such privileges, was he not better than the Gentiles.<a name=323:16></a> No, in nowise.<a name=323:17></a> The apostle had before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they were all under sin.<a name=323:18></a> And now he cites a number of passages to prove that the Jews in their own scriptures are considered as being under the guilt and power of sin.<a name=323:19></a> With regard to the heathen there could be no doubt of it; they were entirely alienated from God, sunk in idolatry and the service of false gods, and living in lawlessness.<a name=323:20></a> But the Jew thought quite otherwise of himself.<a name=323:21></a> He had been brought near, and made to participate in all privileges.<a name=323:22></a> The apostle had himself acknowledged it as the greatest privilege of the Jews, that to them were committed the word of God, the oracles of God.<a name=323:23></a> But now what said these oracles, which related to the Jews, and in which they boasted as belonging solely to them?<a name=323:24></a> They said, "There is none righteous, no, not one.<a name=323:25></a>" A whole series of passages, quoted by the apostle from the Psalms and Isaiah, demonstrate the thoroughly sinful condition in every respect of those of whom they speak.<a name=323:26></a> And that they speak of the Jews, they themselves must allow, according to their universal principle; for "we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law.<a name=323:27></a>" Thus <i>every</i> mouth is stopped, and the <i>whole</i> world guilty before God.<a name=323:28></a> The Gentiles are wholly <i>without</i> God; but the Jews are <i>condemned</i> by this very word of God in which they boast.<a name=323:29></a> So that by works of law shall no flesh be justified in His sight; "for by the law is the <i>knowledge</i> of sin.<a name=323:30></a>" The law, that they accepted as the rule of righteousness, proved that man was a sinner; it convicted and condemned him, and that expressly in his conscience, producing at the same time the consciousness of sin in him.<a name=323:31></a>

		When the apostle had in this way proved that all men are sinners, he returns to what he had already laid down in chapter 1: 17, as the principle of the gospel; namely, the revelation of the righteousness of God.<a name=324:1></a> All that comes between chapters 1: 18 and 3: 21 forms a parenthesis to shew that the righteousness of God is necessary because there is none in man.<a name=324:2></a> After this is done, the apostle enters more closely into the subject of the righteousness of God and its application to man.<a name=324:3></a> This righteousness stands in no relation to the law, which was only the perfect rule for man.<a name=324:4></a> But God cannot measure His righteousness by the standard of man's righteousness, or his responsibility.<a name=324:5></a> It is according to this standard that He <i>judges</i> those who have had the law.<a name=324:6></a> <i>His</i> righteousness must be measured according to His own nature, and His nature is revealed in what He does.<a name=324:7></a> He must glorify Himself; that is to say, manifest Himself; for with God to be manifested is also to be glorified.<a name=324:8></a> If He judges, He judges man according to his human responsibility; if He acts, it is in accordance with His own nature.<a name=324:9></a> The law knows nothing of this nature; it says we ought to love God, but what is He?<a name=324:10></a> The law is adapted to man and his relationship towards God.<a name=324:11></a> The righteousness of God stands entirely outside all question of the law, of every description of law, unless the nature of God be regarded as such.<a name=324:12></a> He is a law for Himself, perfect in His nature.<a name=324:13></a> His righteousness is now shewn in what He has done with regard to the Person of Christ, by having set Him at His right hand as the result of His finished work.<a name=324:14></a> The law and the prophets testified of it.<a name=324:15></a> The righteousness of God has been exercised in the acceptance and glorifying of Christ in virtue of His work, and in this acceptance we share by faith, because He accomplished this work for us.<a name=324:16></a> Precisely because it is the righteousness of <i>God</i> founded on the work of Christ, in that He died for <i>all</i>, it has to do with the whole world and with all men.<a name=324:17></a> All who believe on Christ, whether Jews or heathen, have part in it, and in all the privileges which flow from it.<a name=324:18></a> Were it human righteousness it would have to be according to the law; were it according to the law only the Jews would have had part in it, because they alone had the law.<a name=324:19></a> But as it is the righteousness of <i>God</i> it is manifested for all, and righteousness is reckoned to all who believe.<a name=324:20></a> Thus the righteousness of God by faith of Jesus Christ is manifested for all sinners; it rests on all who believe in Him.<a name=324:21></a> "For there is no difference: for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.<a name=324:22></a>"

		By nature, then, all are found in <i>the same</i> condition, because all alike are in sin; but likewise grace also is the same for all, because the righteousness is <i>God's</i> righteousness, and is <i>the same</i> for all believers, and, in consequence, all believers stand accepted in this righteousness on the <i>same</i> ground before God.<a name=325:1></a> God has openly set forth Jesus Christ as a mercy-seat, through faith in His blood, and has thereby shewn His righteousness in regard to the sins of the Old Testament saints, which in His forbearance He had passed over.<a name=325:2></a> But now, inasmuch as Christ has died for them, His righteousness in thus passing over is shewn.<a name=325:3></a> By reason of this expiatory death which God had in view He could pass over those sins.<a name=325:4></a> Further righteousness is also declared at this present time.<a name=325:5></a> It not only throws light upon the ways of God in the past, but is also, for the present time, the manifestation of the ground of justification of believers through an accomplished work; it is therefore a present thing realised in the justification of all believers, according to the righteousness of a righteous God.<a name=325:6></a> God is just, and justifies in virtue of the work of Christ; yea, He shews His righteousness in doing so.<a name=325:7></a> Not as though we deserved it; but in justifying us God recognises the value of the work of Christ.<a name=325:8></a> Thus justification is a manifest known thing, because the work is accomplished.<a name=325:9></a>

		But there was yet another proof that righteousness does not come from works of the law; namely, the example of Abraham, who had the promises before the law was given or promulgated.<a name=326:19></a> The apostle makes use of this part of Israel's history and privileges in order to establish his main principle.<a name=326:20></a> "What shall we then say of Abraham?<a name=326:21></a>" he asks.<a name=326:22></a> "For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not before God.<a name=326:23></a> For what saith the scripture?<a name=326:24></a> Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.<a name=326:25></a>" Thus the principle of justification by faith is fully established in the example of Abraham.<a name=326:26></a> It is not of works; were it so, then the reward would have to be regarded, not as of grace, but of debt.<a name=326:27></a> But to him that worketh not, but <i>believeth</i> on Him that justifies the ungodly, faith is reckoned for righteousness.<a name=326:28></a> And it was with David as with Abraham.<a name=326:29></a> (The apostle adduces the example of these two men, because they form the chief sources of Israel's blessing.<a name=326:30></a>) David also describes the blessedness of the man whom God justifies without works, saying, "Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.<a name=326:31></a> Blessed is the man to whom the Lord doth not impute sin.<a name=326:32></a>" Acceptance in Christ goes farther, it is true; but here, with regard to man's responsibility, we have the truth expressed, that for those who believe in Christ all is accomplished.<a name=326:33></a> Sin is not imputed to them at all; they are free from all guilt; there is no more any charge against them for ever.<a name=326:34></a> Of our position in Christ the apostle speaks later on.<a name=326:35></a> To be accepted in a new position in Christ, according to the value and acceptance of <i>Christ</i> before God, goes farther than justification.<a name=326:36></a> But this justification is perfect for us as responsible men.<a name=326:37></a>

		Moreover, the promise that Abraham should be the heir of the world was not given through the <i>law</i> either to him or to his seed, but through the righteousness of <i>faith</i>; for the law came much later.<a name=328:1></a> Thus the whole history of Israel proves that it is not through the law that one participates in the blessing, but through faith.<a name=328:2></a> For if they which are of the law, as such, are heirs, then the promise is annulled, and faith by which Abraham received it is in vain and without result.<a name=328:3></a> More than this, the law worketh wrath; for where no law is, there is no transgression; sin indeed exists, but one cannot <i>transgress</i> what is not commanded or forbidden.<a name=328:4></a> But the apostle further develops from the Scriptures this fundamental principle of the blessing of believers from the Gentiles.<a name=328:5></a> He says, "Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed, not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us <i>all</i>" (believers of the Gentiles as well as of the Jews), "before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were" (verse 16, 17).<a name=328:6></a> These words contain a new truth.<a name=328:7></a> They point to the power of resurrection, to the power of giving life where all lies in death, to creative power.<a name=328:8></a> This power admitted the Gentiles also.<a name=328:9></a> Abraham counted upon it when his body was in a manner already dead, and Sarah's womb likewise.<a name=328:10></a> All depends for faith upon the activity of this power which brings about what God wills.<a name=328:11></a> It is not only that there is presented a mercy-seat for all those who draw nigh through faith in the blood of Christ to the place where God meets with the sinner, but there is a power which there, where there was nothing, creates children for itself out of dead souls.<a name=328:12></a> Still there is a difference between Abraham's faith and ours.<a name=328:13></a> He believed, and rightly so, that God <i>could</i> raise the dead; we believe that God <i>has done it</i>.<a name=328:14></a> And this is a very important difference.<a name=328:15></a> Abraham was right in believing God's own word; we have the same faith, but it is founded upon a <i>finished</i> work, and there the soul finds rest.<a name=328:16></a> Christ is risen.<a name=328:17></a> He, who was once offered for our offences, has been raised again that we may believe and be justified.<a name=328:18></a>

		The first part of chapter 5 (vers.<a name=329:17></a> 1-11) summarises all the features of this infinite grace of God.<a name=329:18></a> Let us briefly consider the contents of these precious verses.<a name=329:19></a> The work is accomplished; faith knows that God has accepted it, because He has raised up Christ and seated Him at His right hand.<a name=329:20></a> Nothing remains between the man, born again and sanctified, and God, but the value of the work of Christ, and the acceptance of His Person.<a name=329:21></a> The blood of Christ is ever before the eye of God, and He Himself appears in the presence of God for us.<a name=329:22></a> This gives us, in the present, the most blessed privileges, as well as the hope of glory for the future which we shall enjoy with Him.<a name=329:23></a> We will not, however, go outside our chapter, but confine ourselves to the consideration of the perfection of the grace of God, so wondrously developed in it.<a name=329:24></a> We find here what God is for us, whilst our position before Him in Christ is only taken up later on.<a name=329:25></a>

		The first eleven verses contain the development of grace and the ways of God in grace; they speak first of what grace gives, and then of the experiences of those that are the subjects of grace.<a name=330:1></a> Christ having been delivered for our sins, and raised again for our justification, we are justified by faith; it is a complete justification; our sins are blotted out, our conscience is purged, and since the value of this work is immutable and for ever before the eye of God, so our justification is valid for ever.<a name=330:2></a> Consequently we are in possession of unalterable peace with God.<a name=330:3></a> No sins can be imputed to us, for they have been already borne, so that we can have no more conscience of sins.<a name=330:4></a> We are, it is true, conscious of the presence of sin in the flesh, but there can be no question of sins that Christ has already borne for us.<a name=330:5></a> We have indeed to humble ourselves, when anything occurs to remind us that we were guilty of the hateful fruits of sin, and have brought the load of them upon the beloved Saviour; but in the presence of God, where Christ and His blood are for ever present, we can never question whether all is forgiven.<a name=330:6></a> It is important that I should not confound the state of my soul with the value of a work accomplished outside me, with the accomplishment of which I had nothing to do, unless by my sins.<a name=330:7></a> But if my sins were laid there on Christ, they cannot any longer be before God.<a name=330:8></a> Christ has not got them on Him in heaven.<a name=330:9></a> If I come before God, I find there, on the one hand, because Christ is there, infinite, unchangeable love; and, on the other, nothing but perfect and divine righteousness in Him, also because He is there.<a name=330:10></a> Infinite love, perfect and divine righteousness, and unchangeable favour, have become the believer's portion in Christ before God.<a name=330:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This leads us a step farther in the consideration of the fruits of grace.<a name=330:12></a> Not only are our sins put away through grace, so that we have peace with God, but we can also <i>enjoy</i> the grace of God by which peace is made, grace which is now ever in the heart of God for us.<a name=330:13></a> Grace has not only set aside every obstacle through the work of Christ, but it remains unchangeably the same in the heart of God.<a name=330:14></a> His eye rests on us with the same love as on Christ.<a name=330:15></a> Through Christ we have peace, through Him also access by faith into the grace and favour in which we stand in Him before God.<a name=330:16></a> We enjoy this favour in the presence of God.<a name=330:17></a> Not only does the heavenly <i>Judge</i> justify us, but a heavenly <i>Father</i> receives us; the light of His gracious countenance, beaming with a Father's love, illumines and gladdens our souls, and comforts our hearts, so that with perfectly restful hearts we are in His presence and walk in His ways; we have the precious consciousness of standing in favour.<a name=330:18></a> As regards our sins, they are all put away; as regards our present condition before God, all is love and favour in the bright light of His countenance; as regards the future, glory awaits us; it is our portion, although we do not yet enjoy it.<a name=330:19></a> Peace, divine favour, the glory in expectation, such is the portion of the believer, the blessed fruit of God's love.<a name=330:20></a>

		Here it might, then, be said, We have all, for past, present, and future.<a name=331:1></a> The apostle has still, however, something to add.<a name=331:2></a> The glory being still a thing of the future for us, we have yet a path to trace to reach it, and God does not forget us in the path also.<a name=331:3></a> Therefore the apostle says, "Not only so, but we glory in tribulations also.<a name=331:4></a>" The wilderness is the place where the experiences of the redeemed are gone through with regard to their actual condition and the ways of God in government.<a name=331:5></a> Redemption is accomplished; we have been brought to God, as it is written: "I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself.<a name=331:6></a>" This is a fact, determined beforehand in the counsels of God, and now accomplished.<a name=331:7></a> The glory forms part of the counsels of God, and this also must have its fulfilment for those who are justified.<a name=331:8></a> The wilderness forms no part of these counsels, but it is the place where we learn His ways with us.<a name=331:9></a> Assuredly the thief on the cross went the same day to be with Christ in paradise, to dwell with Him there.<a name=331:10></a> His condition was fit for such a position.<a name=331:11></a> If on the part of man he has to suffer the consequences of his misdeeds, on the part of God Christ bore for him all that he was guilty of before God, and the justified sinner follows Him the same day into the mansions of bliss, but had not therefore to enter upon a long pathway of experiences.<a name=331:12></a> But in general, the believer has to tread his pilgrim way through a world where difficulties and temptations encounter and surround him on every hand.<a name=331:13></a> Christ has gone before us through this world, and we are called to walk in His footsteps; but our condition is thereby tested.<a name=331:14></a> Redemption does not here come in question, for it is just that which brought us into the wilderness.<a name=331:15></a> But we are responsible according to the calling and position in which redemption has placed us, to walk "worthy of God who has called us to his own kingdom and glory.<a name=331:16></a>"

		But we have yet to consider some other and very important points.<a name=332:12></a> We find the Holy Spirit mentioned here for the first time.<a name=332:13></a> The Holy Ghost shed abroad in the heart is quite another thing from the new birth.<a name=332:14></a> We must, of course, be born again to be able to receive the Holy Ghost, but the sinner needs something more than the new birth.<a name=332:15></a> In this passage the Holy Ghost is looked upon as the seal given to the believer of the value of the blood of Christ, and of the perfect purification in which he participates by the application of this blood.<a name=332:16></a> Washed from his sins, he becomes the <i>habitation</i> of the Holy Spirit.<a name=332:17></a> He is the unction, the believer's seal, and the earnest of glory.<a name=332:18></a> By Him we cry, "Abba, Father," Galatians 4: 6.<a name=332:19></a> By Him we know that we are in Christ, and Christ in us; John 14: 16-20.<a name=332:20></a> And here, in this passage, we learn that by Him also the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts.<a name=332:21></a> The ordinance of God for the purification of the leper (Leviticus 14) furnishes us with a striking type of what takes place now with the believer.<a name=332:22></a> The leper was first washed with water, then sprinkled with blood, and finally anointed with oil.<a name=332:23></a> So now, also, a man is first converted, then made a partaker of the perfect purification wrought by the blood of Christ, and finally he receives the seal of the Holy Ghost.<a name=332:24></a> It is by Him we have the full assurance of our participation in an accomplished redemption by virtue of our blessed relationship with God and with Christ, and He is the earnest of the future glory.<a name=332:25></a> But all is the result of the sprinkling of the blood of Christ.<a name=332:26></a>

		The consideration of this question begins with chapter 5: 12.<a name=334:7></a> The apostle speaks no longer of what we have <i>done</i>, as in the first part of the epistle, but of what we <i>are</i>, and that in consequence of Adam's sin.<a name=334:8></a> By the disobedience of <i>one</i>, the many (that is, all who are by birth connected with him as their father) were made sinners.<a name=334:9></a> "Wherefore as by <i>one</i> man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned" (verse 12).<a name=334:10></a> The continuation of this statement is found in verse 18.<a name=334:11></a> Verses 13-17 form a parenthesis, the object of which is to shew in what relation the law stands to this question, and to prove that man, without having received a law from God, is under the yoke of sin, and subject to judgment.<a name=334:12></a> Death is the proof that sin reigns over all men.<a name=334:13></a> Adam was under a law; he was forbidden to eat of a certain tree.<a name=334:14></a> The Jews, as we all know, were placed as a people under the law of Moses.<a name=334:15></a> Now, if Adam did not observe the original commandment, nor the Jews the law of God, they were definitely guilty in those points wherein they had disobeyed.<a name=334:16></a> They had done that which the law had forbidden.<a name=334:17></a> Verse 14 refers to what is said of Israel in Hosea 6: 7: "They, like Adam, have transgressed the covenant.<a name=334:18></a>" Adam, like Israel, stood in relation with God by a positive law.<a name=334:19></a> With the heathen it was otherwise, they possessed no law.<a name=334:20></a> They had conscience, indeed, and obedience to God was obligatory, but one could not say that in this or that point they had transgressed a known commandment of God, because there was none.<a name=334:21></a> No law existed for them, so what they had done could not be reckoned to them as <i>transgression</i>.<a name=334:22></a> But <i>sin</i> was there; conscience took cognisance of everything that was done against its voice, and death reigned over them.<a name=334:23></a> The reign of death accordingly demonstrated the existence of sin, of which it was the consequence.<a name=334:24></a> Each one, even if not placed under law, had defiled his conscience, and death was the constant proof of the existence of sin.<a name=334:25></a> The Gentiles, who had no law, died just as much as the Jews.<a name=334:26></a>

		Were the operations of grace to be limited, then, to the narrow circle of Judaism, because the Jews alone possessed the promises and all the privileges of a revelation, specially the word of God?<a name=335:1></a> On the contrary.<a name=335:2></a> Christianity was the revelation of God Himself, not merely of the will of God with regard to man; therefore this revelation necessarily reached far beyond the limits of Judaism.<a name=335:3></a> In Christianity there is no nation singled out with a law given to them.<a name=335:4></a> To Israel a law was given which taught what man ought to be, but it did not reveal God.<a name=335:5></a> It was accompanied, it is true, by promises, but promises which were not yet fulfilled; and at the same time it precluded man from approach to God.<a name=335:6></a> But Christianity brought in a revelation of God in love in the Person of His Son; it announced an accomplished redemption through His death, a perfect, present, justification by faith, in virtue of His death.<a name=335:7></a> It testified that the veil which precluded access to God was rent, so that access became perfectly free, and the believer can draw near with boldness by this new and living way.<a name=335:8></a> Thus eternal blessing is not in the <i>first</i> and sinful man, nor yet through the law.<a name=335:9></a> For this, as applied to him, could not do otherwise than condemn him, because it formed the perfect, divine, rule of conduct for man; and since man is a sinner, it puts all under the curse who were placed under the law.<a name=335:10></a> The blessing of God is in the <i>last Adam</i>, the <i>second</i> Man and that as glorified, after having been <i>previously</i> made sin for us -- in Him who met the power of Satan and subjected Himself to death, although He could not be holden of it; who underwent in His soul the curse and the forsaking of God, and whom God, having been perfectly glorified by His work, raised from the dead and seated as Man at His own right hand.<a name=335:11></a> A God who has revealed Himself in such a way could not be God of the Jews only.<a name=335:12></a>

		In verses 15-17 the apostle shews that grace far surpasses sin.<a name=336:1></a> If (verse 15) the consequences of Adam's sin did not remain limited to him, but extended also to his descendants, how much more the consequences of the work of Christ extend to those who are His!<a name=336:2></a> According to verse 16, by Adam's sin all his descendants are lost; but grace, the free gift, is not merely efficacious for the lost condition, but also for <i>many offences</i>.<a name=336:3></a> The superabounding of grace comes out in special relief in verse 17, where it says, "For if by one man's offence <i>death</i> reigned by one" -- one would expect the corresponding thought to be "much more <i>life will</i> reign"; but no, "much more <i>they</i> which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.<a name=336:4></a>"

		The parenthesis closes with verse 17, and the apostle resumes in verse 18 the train of thought interrupted at verse 12.<a name=336:5></a> The consequences of Adam's fall concern <i>all</i>; in the same way the free gift through the work of Christ concerns <i>all</i>.<a name=336:6></a> The gospel can thus be applied to all; it addresses the whole world, all sinners.<a name=336:7></a> In verse 19 we have the actual application.<a name=336:8></a> By the disobedience of <i>one</i> man, the many connected with him, that is to say <i>all</i> men are found in the condition of this <i>one</i>, which is a sinful condition.<a name=336:9></a> By the obedience of <i>one</i> man, all who are connected with him, that is, all Christians, are found in the position of this One, namely, in a position of righteousness before God.<a name=336:10></a> Adam was the figure of the Man that was to come.<a name=336:11></a> In the one we were lost, in the other all those who are connected with Him are saved, righteous before God.<a name=336:12></a> The guilt of a man depends upon what he <i>has done</i>; his actual condition, on the contrary, on what <i>Adam</i> has done.<a name=336:13></a> Adam and Christ are the heads of two races; the one of a sinful, and the other of a race righteous before God, and here life and standing are inseparable.<a name=336:14></a> The law came in by the way between the first and second Adam.<a name=336:15></a> The root of the fallen human race was Adam, the first man.<a name=336:16></a> The Head and the root of life of the blessed and saved race is Christ.<a name=336:17></a>

		But "the law came in by the way," as the measure of what fallen humanity should have been, but never actually was.<a name=336:18></a> The law was never the means of life or of salvation, but the rule of what man ought to have been down here, connected with a <i>promise</i> of life: "the man that doeth them shall live in them" (Galatians 3: 12); but it commanded <i>sinful man</i> not to <i>sin</i>.<a name=336:19></a> Its object was, as the apostle here says, to make the offence abound, not <i>sin</i>, for God can do nothing to augment sin; but when sin was already there, He could give a rule to bring the fruits of it to light.<a name=336:20></a> Thus, although the law formed the perfect rule of conduct for a child of Adam, yet as a matter of fact it was always something by the way.<a name=336:21></a> Man was already a lost sinner, and the law brought out the fruit of the rotten and corrupt tree.<a name=336:22></a> We shall see, further on, that it did more than this In this passage we are only told that it made the offence to abound.<a name=336:23></a>

		Thus the important truth here set before us is not the guilt brought about by wicked works, and the grace by which it has been put away, but <i>the condition of the fallen children of Adam</i>, as a general principle.<a name=337:15></a> (This is why the law is set aside as a secondary thing, although it was valid for the conscience of the Jew, and remains always a perfect rule of human righteousness, and also represented that rule wherever, supported by the authority of God, it was applied.<a name=337:16></a>) In connection with this there is the introduction of a new or second root of <i>saved men</i>, and this in the risen One, just as Adam is the root of <i>fallen man</i>.<a name=337:17></a> Adam did not become the head of a race till he became sinful, and Christ was not in fact the head of a new creation (although God from the beginning had wrought by His Spirit) until divine righteousness had been manifested in His being glorified.<a name=337:18></a> Now when the righteousness of God had been revealed, and indeed become applicable to us, in that Christ was glorified after He had borne our sins, and perfectly glorified God when He had been made sin -- not till then did Christ become the life-giving Head of the new race, accepted of God; and all, from first to last, is the fruit of the unfathomable, infinite, and unutterable grace of God.<a name=337:19></a> Grace reigns, but being founded on the work of Christ, reigns through righteousness.<a name=337:20></a> The end is eternal life, and that in its full and true character, according to the counsels of God, in the glory where Christ, according to this righteousness, has already entered as Man.<a name=337:21></a> Righteousness does not yet reign; it will reign in the day of judgment.<a name=337:22></a> But then human righteousness, namely, that which was due from man, will form the measure of judgment; man will then be judged according to the duties towards God and towards his neighbour, which were imposed upon him by the righteous claims of God.<a name=337:23></a> But the original source of salvation for man is grace, because God is love and we are sinners; for grace is the exercise of love towards those who have no desert, no merit.<a name=337:24></a> And love has therein been manifested, so that the angels learn to know it by God's ways towards us.<a name=337:25></a> But God is also righteous, and must maintain righteousness, and His holiness cannot for ever tolerate sin in His presence.<a name=337:26></a> He has proved that all men lie under sin and are guilty, and then He has acted in His infinite love, not merely in forgiving sins (of which we have already spoken), but in providing an entirely new position according to His eternal counsels, and for His eternal glory, according to what He is in His own nature.<a name=337:27></a> The carrying out of this counsel, and that too in virtue of the work of Christ according to His perfect righteousness, is the expression and the manifestation of His infinite love.<a name=337:28></a> <i>Love is</i> therein manifested, in that He sent His Son and gave Him up for us to death and the curse.<a name=337:29></a> <i>Righteousness is</i> manifested therein, in that He has set Christ, who had glorified Him perfectly, at His right hand in divine glory -- in that glory which as Son of God He had already with the Father before the world was, but to which He had won His title as Son of man, so that divine righteousness must of necessity give Him this place.<a name=337:30></a> And we have part in this glory of God, because the work by which God has been perfectly glorified was at the same time accomplished <i>for us</i>.<a name=337:31></a> We form part of the glory of Christ for eternity.<a name=337:32></a> He would not see of the fruit of the travail of His soul, if He had not His redeemed people with Him in glory.<a name=337:33></a>

		CHAPTER 6
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But here the flesh, which wants to have its own righteousness, and the world, which affects to be the guardian of morality, brings forward an objection in order to resist the truth and grace which shew man to be lost on account of sin.<a name=339:1></a> They say, if by the obedience of one we are constituted <i>righteous</i>, it is then just the same whether we be obedient or disobedient.<a name=339:2></a> This objection only proves that he who makes it knows nothing of the truth, that he has no apprehension whatever of his own lost condition, nor of the new life which the believer has received, and which, because it is of God, cannot tolerate sin.<a name=339:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us observe here what important truths are involved in the change of ground on which man's relation with God rests.<a name=339:4></a> The turning-point is the cross, the death of Christ.<a name=339:5></a> The old man, Adam's race, has been tested without law, under law, and then under the revelation of grace and truth when the Son of God was in this world as Man.<a name=339:6></a> God Himself was come, manifest in the flesh, not to impute sins, but "reconciling the world unto himself"; and if the blessing of the race of the <i>first</i> Adam had been possible it ought to have taken place then; but it was impossible.<a name=339:7></a> Much is said of a connecting link found between God and man, but even God manifested in <i>grace</i> and <i>truth</i> found none.<a name=339:8></a> On the contrary, the death of Christ is the positive, definitive, and absolute <i>breach</i> between man and God.<a name=339:9></a> It was not only that man <i>without</i> law was under sin, nor that under law he was openly disobedient to it, but in rejecting Christ he refused the <i>grace</i> of God which shone forth in Him.<a name=339:10></a> The Lord said (John 12: 31), in speaking of His death, "Now is the judgment of this world"; and in John 15: 24, "They have both seen and hated both me and my Father.<a name=339:11></a>" Therefore it says, in Hebrews 9: 26, "Now once in the <i>end</i> of the world hath he appeared.<a name=339:12></a>" The cross was morally the <i>end</i> of man; but at the same time, and by the same fact in the death of Christ, was laid the foundation of the new creation according to the righteousness of God.<a name=339:13></a> The same fact which on God's part has made an end of the first Adam, inasmuch as his race rejected the Son of God, has also laid the foundation of the new condition of man in the <i>second</i> Adam.<a name=339:14></a> Christ was made sin on the cross; sin was there judged, and the old man for ever set aside.<a name=339:15></a> Now access to God through faith has been made possible; in the resurrection, the <i>new life</i>, even for the body, has been actually brought to light, and the second Man has taken His place <i>in glory</i>.<a name=339:16></a> Just as the first man was driven out of the garden, to become the root of a sinful and lost race, so the second Man has entered the heavenly paradise as root and head of the saved race, as the righteousness of God which is valid for man; and so <i>life</i> and <i>righteousness</i> have become inseparable.<a name=339:17></a> Forgiveness through the blood of Christ is the most powerful motive for an upright walk; the resurrection of Christ in itself unites righteousness and life; it is a "justification of life" (chapter 5: 18).<a name=339:18></a>

		The truth that we are risen with Christ is not further developed in the Epistle to the Romans.<a name=340:1></a> As to the part we have in His death and resurrection, it only says that by faith we reckon ourselves dead to sin, that the glorified Christ is our life, and the Holy Spirit is given to us.<a name=340:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If, then, by the obedience of the One we are constituted righteous, and if there, where sin abounded, grace did much more abound, "shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?<a name=340:3></a>" "Far be the thought," says the apostle.<a name=340:4></a> But in his answer to this question, he does not place us again under law.<a name=340:5></a> That would be nothing short of recognising the old man, the flesh, and, when we are already lost, to introduce afresh responsibility and condemnation; for the flesh is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.<a name=340:6></a> The answer of the Spirit points, on the contrary, to <i>the death of Christ</i>; but all that He has done is valid for us.<a name=340:7></a> The old man has proved itself irremediably bad, and this was, in fact, shewn in the <i>death</i> of Christ.<a name=340:8></a> It is impossible for me now, who am crucified <i>with</i> Him, to recognise the very man that put Christ to death -- I am come to Christ, because man (I myself in my old condition) was such -- and because I have now received a new life, Christ risen from amongst the dead.<a name=340:9></a> But we must consider this somewhat more closely.<a name=340:10></a>

		In having been baptised unto Christ Jesus (our true confession of faith), we were not baptised to a Christ whom the world has received, or who found a connecting link with the first Adam.<a name=341:1></a> On the contrary, the world, man, rejected Him, and drove Him out of the earth; and in this way, as already said, it was shewn that a union between God and man as a child of Adam was perfectly impossible.<a name=341:2></a> Therefore God has begun afresh; we are born <i>anew</i>; Christ has, thanks be to God, as the rejected One, accomplished the work of atonement; He has acquired for those who believe on Him, justification, forgiveness, and glory.<a name=341:3></a> But He is the <i>second</i> Man, and in Him man is found in an entirely new position before God, as well as in an entirely new condition.<a name=341:4></a> A <i>risen</i> Christ is our life, a <i>risen</i> Christ our righteousness; the <i>old</i> man is for ever condemned.<a name=341:5></a> He who possesses Christ as his life shares in all this, because he has part in His death and resurrection.<a name=341:6></a> In Romans the first part only is developed -- we are dead with Him, have died with Him.<a name=341:7></a> He is indeed presented also as our life; but our resurrection with Him is not treated of, because the Holy Spirit here looks at Christians as men living on the earth.<a name=341:8></a> Christ is dead and risen; we are baptised unto His death.<a name=341:9></a> We have part in His death, inasmuch as He is our life.<a name=341:10></a> He, who is my life, died, and He died to <i>sin</i>.<a name=341:11></a> I recognise Him alone as my "I," and as this new "I," I reckon my old "I" as dead.<a name=341:12></a> According to this new life I am alive to God; but as regards my old man I have died with Christ.<a name=341:13></a> How could I still live the life of the old man, if as such I have died?<a name=341:14></a> Therefore, buried with Christ by baptism unto death, it behoves us to walk in <i>newness</i> of life.<a name=341:15></a> If we have part in His position, as dead to sin, we shall also have part in His resurrection.<a name=341:16></a> The apostle does not say that we <i>have</i> part in it, but that we <i>shall</i> have part in it.<a name=341:17></a> This resurrection life will be perfect in glory; but it expresses itself now already in a new walk; just as the power of the life of Christ, which, in a positive way, came out in His resurrection, was also actually manifested in His walk on earth.<a name=341:18></a> "Knowing this," says the apostle, "that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed" (that is to say, that sin in us as a whole might be annulled), "that henceforth we should not serve sin" (verse 6); "for he that is dead is freed [or justified] from sin.<a name=341:19></a>" But this requires fuller explanation.<a name=341:20></a>

		First it is important to seize clearly that the Christian has not yet to die to sin, but that he <i>has</i> died inasmuch as he is crucified with Christ; now that he has received Christ as his life, he reckons the old man dead.<a name=342:1></a> It is not only particular sins or lusts from which he has been delivered, but the old man as a <i>whole is</i> set aside, dead, and to be held for dead by faith which acts according to the new man.<a name=342:2></a> It is true that the nature of the old man is still present in us; our having died with Christ does not result in its having no longer any existence in us, but it has no more <i>dominion</i> -- "that henceforth we should not serve sin.<a name=342:3></a>" There is no necessity to have even a <i>single</i> evil thought, although the nature which produces them still exists; but we do not in any way <i>serve</i> this nature, not even in thought, when the new life and the power of the Holy Spirit are active in us.<a name=342:4></a> The Christian is made free, not because his sins are for ever pardoned, but <i>because he is dead to sin</i>, crucified with Christ.<a name=342:5></a> As dead with Christ he is <i>justified</i> from sin, just <i>because he is dead</i>; but he is also <i>alive</i> in Christ.<a name=342:6></a> It is not only true that sin has no longer dominion, but the Christian is also free to yield himself up; he possesses a new nature, a new holy life.<a name=342:7></a> But to whom shall he now yield himself?<a name=342:8></a> -- to righteousness and to God.<a name=342:9></a> This yielding of oneself is not the act of the <i>sinner</i>, as is very often falsely affirmed, but that of the delivered soul.<a name=342:10></a> The Christian, because he is purified, justified, assured of the love and favour of God, and in possession of a conscience made perfect through the blood of Christ, in that no sin can any more be reckoned to him, is free, has boldness before God.<a name=342:11></a> The same blow that rent the veil removed also all his sin.<a name=342:12></a> Now through the rent veil the light of God shines openly upon him, to shew that his garments are white as snow.<a name=342:13></a> He is set free from the <i>power</i> of sin, because Christ is his life, and, crucified with Christ, and now living by Him alone, he reckons himself dead as regards the flesh.<a name=342:14></a> He is free before God, and also freed from sin.<a name=342:15></a> In this liberty he yields himself to God.<a name=342:16></a>

		Thus the new life, walking with God, gains already something along the way.<a name=343:1></a> We have <i>fruits</i>, even before we reach the glory, and this fruit is holiness.<a name=343:2></a> Blessed fruit!<a name=343:3></a> Beginning with being made partakers of the divine nature, we grow also in <i>practical communion</i> with God, by the growth of holiness in us.<a name=343:4></a> This growth does not set aside the truth that the new nature which we have received is perfect in itself.<a name=343:5></a> We belong absolutely to God, are bought with a price, separated from sin and the world.<a name=343:6></a> We belong to God, according to the value of the sacrifice of Christ, according to the new nature, and the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=343:7></a> After the inward man we already belong to the new creation, although "we have this treasure in earthen vessels.<a name=343:8></a>" We are in Christ, and in Him we are perfectly accepted.<a name=343:9></a> He is our righteousness, a righteousness which is fit for the glory; for He is in the glory according to this righteousness.<a name=343:10></a> But He is also <i>in us</i> as our life, and according to the power of the Spirit.<a name=343:11></a> This life in itself is perfect, and cannot sin; but we must also have a sanctifying object before us.<a name=343:12></a> Therefore the Holy Spirit takes what is in Christ and reveals it to us; yea, He reveals to us all that is up there where Christ is, and where the Father is also.<a name=343:13></a> By this we grow objectively in that which is heavenly; we are weaned from the world, live in spirit in the heavenly places, enjoy the Father's love, and become thus holy in practical ways.<a name=343:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are sanctified according to the counsels of God the Father, through the sacrifice of Christ, by His blood; we are so, as to our being, because we possess a new nature, a new life; we are so by the presence and operation of the Holy Spirit; and we may add, by the word of God.<a name=343:15></a> The sanctification of the Spirit is brought about by our being born of God.<a name=343:16></a> But we must, as I have said, have an object, and the divine nature, the life which we have received, is capable of enjoying this object, God Himself.<a name=343:17></a> By the word the Holy Spirit communicates to us the objects that are holy and divine.<a name=343:18></a> We are first born anew by the word through faith; then we are nourished by the same, and the heart is purified also by faith; and, indeed the one as well as the other by the revelation of Christ in the heart -- "Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth .<a name=343:19></a>.<a name=343:20></a>.<a name=343:21></a> .<a name=343:22></a> And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth," John 17: 17-19.<a name=343:23></a>

		If we would be accurate, we could not say that the new man, the life which we have received from God, <i>is being</i> sanctified; for the new life itself <i>is</i> holy, and inasmuch as we have received it, <i>we</i> are sanctified for God; therefore it is that in the apostolic epistles believers are called saints.<a name=343:24></a> But holiness in us is relative; that is to say, it refers to God, because we cannot be independent.<a name=343:25></a> No doubt an actual condition is thereby produced in us; but we are not holy as independent; for it is sin for a creature to be independent, nor is it possible to be really independent.<a name=343:26></a> Thus holiness in us is objective; this is an important principle.<a name=343:27></a> All that the Holy Spirit has revealed to us -- the love of the Father and of Christ, the holiness of God, the perfection of Christ, His Person which has been given to us and delivered up for us, His being glorified now in heaven -- all this operates in us, and forms the heart, the thoughts, the inward and thereby also the outward man, according to the object that we contemplate.<a name=343:28></a> All that Christ has done and suffered is concerned in it, not only because His walk and His ways are a pattern for us, but because they engage the heart with Him.<a name=343:29></a> The affections of the heart are occupied with Christ and with His perfection, and He fills our hearts.<a name=343:30></a> That is sanctification; for this also fills the Father's heart.<a name=343:31></a> "Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life," John 10: 17.<a name=343:32></a> The Father appreciates what Christ has done, and what He was in doing it, and it was done for us.<a name=343:33></a> We have holy thoughts in loving and appreciating what He has done, and what He was.<a name=343:34></a> Thus we have in us the mind which was in Christ.<a name=343:35></a> It is one side of the Christian character.<a name=343:36></a>

		But the power of sanctification is wrought in us especially by the contemplation of <i>the glory of Christ</i>.<a name=344:1></a> The heart is indeed nourished by all that He was down here; we eat His flesh and drink His blood, enjoy also the bread which came down from heaven; but what transforms us into His image (2 Corinthians 3: 18; 1 John 3: 2, 3) is the glory in which He now dwells.<a name=344:2></a> Beholding this glory we are changed into the same image.<a name=344:3></a> The <i>glory</i> of Christ produces in us the energy of life, because we count all else for loss.<a name=344:4></a> The <i>life</i> and the <i>sufferings</i> of Christ engage the heart with Him.<a name=344:5></a> (See Philippians 2 and 3.<a name=344:6></a>)

		With regard to holiness we learn further, in Hebrews 12: 10, that the <i>discipline</i> of God has for its object to make us partakers of His holiness.<a name=345:1></a> In this passage we discover not only the unceasing care of God, but we learn also the precious character of this holiness.<a name=345:2></a> We have deserved death as the mournful wages of our sad work; eternal life, the gift of God, has become ours through Jesus Christ our Lord; and this is pure grace.<a name=345:3></a> Who else could give us life -- eternal life, divine life, but God Himself?<a name=345:4></a> Christ Himself is this life, sent from the Father into the world, and here revealed in manhood.<a name=345:5></a> Now "he that hath the Son hath life"; "he that believeth on him hath everlasting life," 1 John 1: 2; chapter 5: 12; John 3: 36.<a name=345:6></a> Although in the last verse (of our chapter) the reference is more to the result in glory, because in the counsels of God eternal life means perfect conformity to Christ in glory; yet it is none the less given to us now as life, although we are not yet in the glory.<a name=345:7></a> It is important for us to remark that it is the gift of God.<a name=345:8></a> Man had through sin earned death for himself; life, eternal life, in which we are capable of having fellowship with God, must be given of God.<a name=345:9></a> This life is Christ Himself; I John 1.<a name=345:10></a> He is the life which was with the Father, and came down here.<a name=345:11></a> In Him was life; he that hath the Son hath life, and this life will be fully manifested in glory.<a name=345:12></a> That is the principle of the new standing.<a name=345:13></a> We have died with Christ to the old standing, and Christ is become our life.<a name=345:14></a>

		CHAPTER 7
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle treats a new question in this chapter: What is the effect of the <i>law</i> in relation to our new position?<a name=345:15></a> The principle is simple.<a name=345:16></a> We have died with Christ; but <i>law</i> has dominion over a man only so long as he <i>lives</i>.<a name=345:17></a> If a murderer is condemned to death, and suffers death according to the sentence, the judicial authority has nothing more to do with him.<a name=345:18></a> Now we have died; yet if it were only by the law that we were put to death, we should be not only dead but condemned also.<a name=345:19></a> But now we have died <i>with Christ</i>, and He has borne for us the consequences of sin, as guilt.<a name=345:20></a> Thus we are dead, and the law, therefore, exercises no more authority over us.<a name=345:21></a> Christ has taken the place of the law.<a name=345:22></a> Instead of a law which forbade sins and lusts, and must of necessity condemn us (because the flesh, to which the law addressed its claims, was not subject to it, nor could be), we possess a new life in Christ; while by faith we reckon the flesh dead, which is disposed to sin.<a name=345:23></a> The apostle makes use of marriage as an illustration; death dissolves the tie between husband and wife.<a name=345:24></a> Thus we are dead with respect to the law, and are connected with another husband; namely, the risen Christ.<a name=345:25></a> The figure is employed here inversely.<a name=345:26></a> Not the <i>law</i>, but <i>we</i>, as having had our life in the flesh, have died.<a name=345:27></a> Such is the <i>doctrine</i>.<a name=345:28></a> In what follows, the apostle speaks of <i>experience</i>.<a name=345:29></a> This in no wise annuls the important principle, but rather confirms the deliverance of the soul from the law by having died with Christ, who is now become our new life.<a name=345:30></a> According to the figure of marriage employed by the apostle, we are connected as by marriage with Christ, and thereby are brought into an entirely new position -- that of relationship.<a name=345:31></a> Therefore it says, "When we <i>were</i> in the flesh.<a name=345:32></a>" Being "in the flesh" means standing on the ground or in the position of the first Adam before God, and being responsible to Him according to this position.<a name=345:33></a> It is not a question here of <i>guilt</i>, but of the deliverance of the soul from the <i>yoke of sin</i>.<a name=345:34></a> When one is lawless, and seeking nothing but pleasure, the conscience can indeed be awakened for a time, but the power of sin is not felt.<a name=345:35></a> He goes with the stream, and is not aware that he is under the dominion of sin.<a name=345:36></a> When one is converted one is first occupied with guilt, with the burden of sins.<a name=345:37></a> Even when one has learnt to know the forgiveness of sins, and to believe that one is a child of God, the form of experience may indeed be changed because it is no longer a question of justification; but the soul is none the less troubled so long as, in the path of experience, it is not delivered from the power of indwelling sin.<a name=345:38></a> The question ever afresh arises, "How can God accept me, or how can He delight in me, when sin, which I cannot overcome, is still present?<a name=345:39></a>" As long as forgiveness is not known, the question is, "How can I obtain forgiveness?<a name=345:40></a>" If it has been found, the question still remains, "What <i>am I</i> before God?<a name=345:41></a> How can such an one as I be accepted?<a name=345:42></a> May I not really have deceived myself?<a name=345:43></a>" In a word, the eye is solely directed to that which we are in ourselves before God.<a name=345:44></a> We see that sin is still there, and yet a Christian ought to obtain the victory over sin.<a name=345:45></a> Such an one is in fact, or in the condition of his mind and thoughts, still in the flesh.<a name=345:46></a>

		We have already remarked that the <i>position is</i> found in the first four verses.<a name=346:1></a> The fifth and sixth verses lead us on to <i>experience</i>.<a name=346:2></a> In the flesh we were connected as by marriage with the law.<a name=346:3></a> This gave neither life, nor strength, nor confidence in God; it forbade sins, and imputed them to me.<a name=346:4></a> Not only that, but it gave occasion to sin in the flesh to become active so as to bring forth fruit unto death.<a name=346:5></a> It brought sins and lusts before the heart by forbidding them.<a name=346:6></a> If a heap of money lie on the table, and I am told not to take any of it, immediately the desire to do so is awakened in me.<a name=346:7></a> Or if I say, "I have something here in this drawer, but no one must know what it is," instantly every one, small and great, feels a desire to open it.<a name=346:8></a> The passions of sins are in no way <i>of</i> the law, but by it.<a name=346:9></a> It supposes, however, the existence of the flesh, and that we do not possess the strength of Christ.<a name=346:10></a> But now (in Christ) we are delivered from the law, being dead to that wherein we were held.<a name=346:11></a> In the flesh we were under the yoke of the law; the flesh was the source of sins, and now for faith it is dead, that we may serve in newness of spirit.<a name=346:12></a> The death of the flesh, of the old man, forms the basis of the transition from bondage in the flesh to liberty in the Spirit.<a name=346:13></a> At the same time this death stands in connection with redemption.<a name=346:14></a>

		But how is this end to be attained?<a name=347:1></a> This is quite another thing from desiring it.<a name=347:2></a> The doctrine is presented very clearly and simply in the word of God.<a name=347:3></a> But there are many who, according to this doctrine, know that the Christian is dead with Christ, and even raised with Him; who believe also that they have died with Him, because the word of God so plainly declares it; who do not doubt that they are children of God, and that such a position belongs to the child of God, and who, in spite of all this, are not delivered.<a name=347:4></a> There are even upright souls, who, seeing that they do not walk as they would wish, begin to doubt, and to ask if they are not hypocrites, if they have not deceived themselves.<a name=347:5></a> They believe, and rightly, that God looks for something in them other than He sees.<a name=347:6></a> They make everything depend on what they are in themselves before God.<a name=347:7></a> But that is law, and not grace.<a name=347:8></a> The answer to the question, how the condition of liberty is reached, is developed from verse 7 onwards.<a name=347:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In order to be truly delivered, one must learn, and that by experience, that one is captive to the power of sin, and has no power to deliver oneself, even when desiring to be free.<a name=347:10></a> To this end God makes use of the law, and the desire of the new man to be free from the yoke of sin that he hates.<a name=347:11></a> Thus the Christian learns, not that he has sinned -- this is not here the subject under consideration -- but that while he would like to attain to holiness, a principle of sin is at work in his flesh.<a name=347:12></a> The law teaches him that God cannot permit this; his renewed mind recognises that God could not allow it; neither does he himself desire it.<a name=347:13></a> And yet this principle of sin exists, powerfully active, too strong for him to be able to free himself from it.<a name=347:14></a>

		On this account the law has not only established with divine authority, the duties for all human relationships, but has also added, "Thou shalt not lust.<a name=348:1></a>" That is a touchstone for man, bringing clearly to light what his <i>state</i> is, even if he has not outwardly sinned, even when through conversion his will is directed to holiness.<a name=348:2></a> This holiness after which he seeks he cannot attain.<a name=348:3></a> When he was without law, the sentence of death was not felt, if he had not done anything against the voice of his conscience.<a name=348:4></a> He lived on at ease, not carrying about with him the sense of condemnation.<a name=348:5></a> But the law came, and pronounced condemnation on lust.<a name=348:6></a> Experience teaches that this lust exists in the heart, and now conscience feels the sentence of condemnation; lust itself is awakened, and all comes to light.<a name=348:7></a> Conscience feels the sentence.<a name=348:8></a> One would like to do good, but finds that evil is constantly present.<a name=348:9></a>

		In verse 13, the apostle goes on to describe the effect of the law on the experience of the soul who thus desires what is good.<a name=349:1></a> In the previous verse it is recognised that the law is holy, and the commandment holy and just and good.<a name=349:2></a> The question now naturally arises, "Was then that which is good made death unto me?<a name=349:3></a>" In nowise.<a name=349:4></a> But <i>sin</i> worked death <i>by</i> that which is good (the law) in order that sin might be fully manifested, might assume its true character, and become exceeding sinful, in that it has made use of what is good to bring about death.<a name=349:5></a> The evil does not manifest itself only as evil in itself, but also as <i>disobedience</i>, because it is forbidden, and thus through the prohibition becomes exceeding sinful.<a name=349:6></a> Sin in man has a strong will; in that he <i>wills</i> to do what is evil, even when God has forbidden it.<a name=349:7></a> If my child runs out to amuse himself instead of doing his tasks, it is a bad habit; but if I forbid him to run out, and he still goes on with the bad habit, it is disobedience besides.<a name=349:8></a> By the commandment sin has become exceeding sinful.<a name=349:9></a> It shews that in me not only were there evil lusts, but that self-will which commits the evil, in spite of God's prohibition, is also there; God and His word are despised.<a name=349:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This deliverance stands in the closest connection with redemption, not so much with regard to forgiveness as with regard to our having died with Christ.<a name=351:1></a> We have already seen that there are two main points in redemption: namely, the forgiveness of sins, or justification, and deliverance: liberty before God, and liberty from the yoke of sin in the flesh.<a name=351:2></a> Now if we have died with Christ, we have died to <i>sin</i>, and are no longer in <i>the flesh</i> before God.<a name=351:3></a> Life in the flesh is no more our position, because Christ, after having <i>died</i>, has become our life.<a name=351:4></a> Sin in the flesh is judged, condemned -- not forgiven -- and that in the <i>death</i> of Christ on the cross.<a name=351:5></a> The power of the life of Christ is in me, is my life; yet not only that.<a name=351:6></a> Sin in the flesh, which was my torment, is already judged, but in another; so that there is for me no more condemnation on account of the flesh.<a name=351:7></a> Death has entered in where this condemnation, the judgment of the flesh, has been executed, and those who are in Christ Jesus have died with Him, so that there is no more condemnation for them.<a name=351:8></a> What has happened to Him has happened to us; He died to sin, and the condemnation is passed.<a name=351:9></a> This is our condition with respect to sin in the flesh.<a name=351:10></a> If the first part of the epistle has shewn clearly how sins are taken away, we find here as clearly how sin in the flesh and condemnation are taken away; yea, for faith the flesh itself is done away with, since we are <i>dead</i>.<a name=351:11></a>

		This condition is described in the first three verses of chapter 8.<a name=352:1></a> The Christian is in an entirely new position: he is in Christ.<a name=352:2></a> Not only has the grace of God been manifested in the sins of the old man being forgiven, but his position also is an entirely new one; <i>we</i> are redeemed.<a name=352:3></a> It does not say, "There is therefore now no condemnation for those whose sins are forgiven," but "to them which are <i>in Christ Jesus</i>.<a name=352:4></a>" This position is the result of the work of Christ, of redemption.<a name=352:5></a> The Christian is delivered with Christ from his position in the flesh because he has died with Him, and has part in the life of the risen and glorified Christ.<a name=352:6></a> Thus he no longer stands before God as a child of Adam responsible in the flesh, but as one who has actually, by death, left this position, and who is alive in Christ.<a name=352:7></a> The flesh is considered as dead, as condemned, as no more to be seen, but as vanquished in the death of Christ.<a name=352:8></a> The Christian is alive in Christ; he is no longer in the flesh.<a name=352:9></a> (Compare Galatians 2: 19, 20.<a name=352:10></a>)

		The expression, "The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus," in the second verse of our chapter, may appear strange to many readers.<a name=352:11></a> It means, I believe, that the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus operates constantly, unceasingly, according to one and the same principle, in order that, since the flesh has been condemned in another, it should be dead in the believer.<a name=352:12></a> Through the life of Christ and the Holy Spirit the believer is <i>in Christ</i>.<a name=352:13></a> How could there be any more condemnation there?<a name=352:14></a> God has already occupied Himself with sin in the flesh at the cross, and now, if one may say so, is done with it.<a name=352:15></a> The new life and the Holy Spirit give to the quickened believer his place in Christ; he is redeemed and alive before God in Christ.<a name=352:16></a> It is not a question here, as already said, of forgiveness of the sins of the old man, but of a new living position in Christ.<a name=352:17></a> This is what is presented in the first three verses of chapter 8.<a name=352:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		After that, in chapter 7, the experience of the first position, as well as deliverance through redemption in Christ, and the continuance of the two natures as an actual fact, have been described, the first three verses of chapter 8 give us the new position in Christ in contrast with the position in the flesh, or in the first Adam.<a name=352:19></a> In the first verse, no condemnation; in the second, the power of life; in the third, the judgment of sin in the flesh in Christ on the cross.<a name=352:20></a> The second verse is characterised by life in Christ according to the power of the Holy Spirit, and that as a principle unceasingly in operation.<a name=352:21></a> The judgment of sin in the flesh in the sin-offering of Christ marks the third verse.<a name=352:22></a> Sin is, indeed, still there, and, if we are not faithful, if we do not practically bear about with us the dying of the Lord Jesus, it is active in us; we lose communion with God, and dishonour the Lord by our behaviour, in not walking, according to the Spirit of life, worthy of the Lord.<a name=352:23></a> But we are no longer <i>under the law of sin</i>, but, having died with Christ, and become partakers of a new life in Him and of the Holy Spirit, we are delivered from this law.<a name=352:24></a> We are in a new position, in the <i>second</i> Adam before God, and our normal walk is according to the Spirit, not according to the flesh.<a name=352:25></a> Thus the law of God and its requirements are fulfilled in us.<a name=352:26></a> The doctrine does not go beyond that, because it is a question of one who desired the law.<a name=352:27></a>

		But the law is not the measure of Christian walk; it only says that he who walks according to the Spirit fulfils it.<a name=353:1></a> When I was in the flesh I could not fulfil it, because the flesh is not subject to the law, nor can be, but only follows its own will.<a name=353:2></a> But the Spirit will assuredly not lead us into that which is contrary to the law of God.<a name=353:3></a> The law is practically fulfilled, while we are not under the law, but under the guidance of the Spirit.<a name=353:4></a> We are under the influence of the Spirit and it is not a question of a law <i>outside us</i>, but of a nature <i>in us</i>, which possesses an object suitable to it.<a name=353:5></a> They who live after the Spirit, according to the new man, desire the things of the Spirit; but they that are after the flesh set their minds on the objects of their fleshly lusts.<a name=353:6></a> We have not to do with an imposed law, but a new mind, the mind of a nature which is born of the Spirit, and which seeks what is spiritual; a holy liberty, in that the man, as having died with Christ, is delivered from the yoke of sin possesses a holy nature born of God, has holy objects before him, and is the habitation of the Holy Spirit, who produces holy thoughts in the heart, and reveals the things that are above.<a name=353:7></a> The minding of the flesh is death to the soul; it bears no fruit, and separates the soul from God, now and for eternity.<a name=353:8></a> But the minding of the Spirit is life, a well in us which springs up into everlasting life, and fills the soul with peace.<a name=353:9></a> The mind of the flesh rebels against the authority of God.<a name=353:10></a> Inasmuch as it makes up the activity of the natural man, it has to do with the law, which is the expression of this authority of God over man, and the rule of his responsibility as a creature of God.<a name=353:11></a> But it is not subject to the law, neither indeed can be, because self-will will go its own way; besides it has no love whatever for what pleases God.<a name=353:12></a> Thus they that are in the flesh, who are found before God in the position of the first Adam, and walk according to the life of the first Adam, cannot please God.<a name=353:13></a>

		This liberty is presented and developed very clearly in the Epistle to the Romans, but only so far as that the believer is there looked at as having died with Christ, and possessing Christ as his life, whereby he has been delivered from the law of sin, as well as from the law of Moses, because this has dominion over a man so long as he lives, and cannot go further.<a name=355:1></a> The epistle, however, does not take up the counsels of God and the glory of our new position, though this doctrine is approached in chapter 8: 29, 30.<a name=355:2></a> But in general the epistle treats of man's responsibility, as well as of what God has done to cleanse and to justify us from our guilt, teaching us at the same time how we have been delivered from the law of sin and death by our death with Christ.<a name=355:3></a> The above-mentioned verses open out a somewhat more extended view; but the new position is not further developed.<a name=355:4></a> The epistle does not go beyond the truth that we have been quickened by Christ; it does not speak of our resurrection with Him.<a name=355:5></a> This, the starting-point of our new position, we must look for in the Epistle to the Colossians.<a name=355:6></a> That to the Ephesians develops this doctrine yet further, from another point of view, however.<a name=355:7></a> There we do not find that a child of Adam must die, and rise again, and that the believer has died, although he is represented as risen with Christ.<a name=355:8></a> The unconverted man in the Ephesians, is looked at rather as <i>dead</i> in sins, and all is a <i>new</i> creation.<a name=355:9></a> We find there all the counsels of God, both as to believers raised with Christ, as to Christ Himself, as to the children of God, and our union with Christ as His body.<a name=355:10></a>

		This gives the apostle occasion to speak of the position of those led by the Spirit of God, and in the first place of their relationship to God.<a name=357:14></a> The Spirit that they have received is the Spirit of adoption; they possess Him because they are children.<a name=357:15></a> But extensive results in blessing flow from this relationship; if they are children, they are also heirs -- heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ.<a name=357:16></a> Meanwhile the condition of the creation around us here below, and particularly that of our own bodies, is not yet restored.<a name=357:17></a> The mind of the <i>flesh</i> is enmity against God, just as also the friendship of the world is enmity against Him.<a name=357:18></a> The principles of the flesh, as of the world, are opposed to us; both are subject to the bondage of corruption.<a name=357:19></a> Moreover the world through which we have to pass as pilgrims, being alienated from God, and under the dominion of Satan, furnishes us with innumerable sources of sorrow and pain.<a name=357:20></a> The Lord Jesus was in this world "a Man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief.<a name=357:21></a>" A world of <i>sin</i> in contrast with His holiness, a world of <i>sorrow</i> and suffering in contrast with His love, could not but be for His heart a source of sorrow and pain.<a name=357:22></a> He found Himself isolated and alone in such a world, and not even His disciples understood Him.<a name=357:23></a> Full of sympathy for all, He found sympathy nowhere for Himself.<a name=357:24></a> If such did once break through the darkness of man's heart, it was something so wonderful that the Lord says, "Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her," Mark 14: 9.<a name=357:25></a>

		But this doctrine, complete in itself, still left a difficult question unanswered; that is, in respect to the condition of the Jews.<a name=365:15></a> The apostle has clearly demonstrated that the Jew is guilty because he has transgressed the law, and that consequently there is no difference between the Jews and the heathen; all have sinned, are guilty before God, and subject to His judgment.<a name=365:16></a> The Jews could not deny that they had transgressed the law; but they could appeal to the unconditional promises made to them in Abraham and their other forefathers.<a name=365:17></a> Now chapters 9-11 meet these difficulties.<a name=365:18></a>

		There are undoubtedly <i>unconditional</i> promises made to the Jewish nation.<a name=365:19></a> But, in the first place, they are not all Israel that are of the stock of Israel; and what is still more important, they have rejected Him in whom these promises were to be fulfilled, and in whom their fulfilment was offered to them, thereby losing all right to such fulfilment; "they stumbled at that stumbling-stone.<a name=365:20></a>" But then, after that all blessing, for them no less than for the heathen, is become a matter of pure mercy, the apostle shews that God, who is unchangeably faithful, will in grace accomplish all that He has promised.<a name=365:21></a> We find the proof of these principles in chapters 9-11.<a name=365:22></a>

		In the first place, the apostle gives expression to his unalterable love for his people.<a name=366:1></a> His heart was filled with sorrow at their rejection; yea, so far was he from being indifferent as to this, that he would rather have seen himself accursed, separated from Christ, than the beloved people.<a name=366:2></a> As Christ Himself, when from the summit of the Mount of Olives He saw Jerusalem stretched out before His eyes, wept over it on account of the hardness of heart of the people, or as Moses once (Exodus 32: 32) interceded for the idolatrous people, so here we find the apostle giving expression to the same feelings of love and sorrow.<a name=366:3></a> This wish was not the expression of serious and calm deliberation, neither did it belong to the moment then present; but it had arisen from a heart deeply oppressed by the thought of the rejection of the people beloved of God -- his kinsmen according to the flesh.<a name=366:4></a> It was the exclamation of a heart unable to repress its overwhelming feelings.<a name=366:5></a> He enumerates their privileges up to the Messiah descended from them according to the flesh, for his heart was yet full of all that appertained to them in connection with God.<a name=366:6></a> Moreover, he does not speak as if the word of God had failed in its object, "For they are not all Israel which are of Israel, neither because they are the seed of Abraham are they all children.<a name=366:7></a>" In Isaac only had the seed the children's place before God.<a name=366:8></a> The children of the flesh are not on that account children of God, but the children according to the promise are alone counted for the seed.<a name=366:9></a> Ishmael did not belong to this seed of God; for the word, "At this time will I come, and Sarah shall have a son," is a word of promise, and does not refer to Ishmael.<a name=366:10></a> If it be objected, "But Hagar was only a bondwoman, a concubine," such, however, was not the case with Rebekah; and to her it was said concerning the children which should be born of her -- of her only, and at the same time, and that before they were born, or had done either good or evil (that the purpose of God according to the election of grace might stand) -- "The elder shall serve the younger.<a name=366:11></a> As it is written: Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.<a name=366:12></a>" If, then, the Jews would not recognise God's sovereignty, but desired to take their stand upon their descent from Abraham after the flesh, they must also allow the Edomites and Ishmaelites to have part in the promises; this, however, they would not tolerate.<a name=366:13></a>

		However, important as this may be, it is not all that the apostle has to bring forward as proof of his position.<a name=367:1></a> He asks, "Is there unrighteousness with God?<a name=367:2></a> Far be the thought.<a name=367:3></a>" According to His divine title He can without doubt shew mercy to whom He will, as He says also to Moses, "I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy.<a name=367:4></a>" "So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.<a name=367:5></a>" And what was the occasion on which God spoke thus to Moses?<a name=367:6></a> When Israel had made the golden calf, at a time when God, if He had not retreated into His own sovereignty in which He was free to shew <i>grace</i>, must have destroyed the whole nation except Moses and Joshua; so that then, according to the carnal Jewish principle, the Ishmaelites and Edomites must have become heirs of the promises, while Israel would have been shut out.<a name=367:7></a> We find the same principle in Israel's deliverance out of bondage in Egypt.<a name=367:8></a> God had not made Pharaoh's heart <i>bad</i>, it was so already; but He <i>hardened</i> it, that He might glorify His name and power in all the earth.<a name=367:9></a> Thus He shews mercy to whom He will, and whom He will He hardens.<a name=367:10></a> His ways with Israel were a clear and indisputable proof of it; for otherwise their enemies would have become heirs of the promises, but they themselves would have been excluded, and the glorious beginning of their history would have been falsified.<a name=367:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Further, the apostle proceeds to consider the doctrine which is connected with this exposition, and applies the whole to the ways of God with Israel and with the heathen of that time, anticipating the objections of the flesh.<a name=367:12></a> What becomes, then, of man's responsibility?<a name=367:13></a> Why does God still impute sin to man?<a name=367:14></a> Who hath resisted His will?<a name=367:15></a> The apostle answers these questions in a threefold manner.<a name=367:16></a> First, as creatures of God we have not the right to judge His actions; that which is formed cannot say to Him who formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?<a name=367:17></a> This absolute right of God forms the foundation of the apostle's argument.<a name=367:18></a> If the rights of the <i>creature</i> must be maintained, how much more then must the <i>Almighty God</i> have His own?<a name=367:19></a> He judges men, but men are not competent to judge Him.<a name=367:20></a> The apostle here comes to facts, and shews how God had endured the wicked with much long-suffering, in order to make known His power despised by them, and has revealed His wrath against hardened wickedness in them; how, on the other hand, He makes known the riches of His glory in the vessels of mercy which He had afore prepared unto glory.<a name=367:21></a> God is not subject to the opinions of men; but the order of His revealed ways is, that He endures the wicked for whom judgment is meet, and prepares the vessels of mercy for glory, that is to say, Christians from among the Jews and Gentiles.<a name=367:22></a> The force and bearing, thus, of the apostle's argument is this: If God is not entirely free to act according to His election and His determinate purpose, and the Jews would rely upon their natural descent (as they actually did), then they must admit the Ishmaelites; but if they refuse their admittance on the pretext that Ishmael was the son of a slave, on no pretext can they reject the Edomites.<a name=367:23></a> Not only so, but with the single exception of the family of Moses, and perhaps that of Joshua, the Jews themselves would have had to be excluded, because it was only by the will of God that they were spared at Sinai.<a name=367:24></a> Since, however, God does what He wills, He also saves souls from amongst the Gentiles, as it is written in Hosea.<a name=367:25></a> The apostle says, in verse 24, "Us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles.<a name=367:26></a>" Accordingly verse 25 has its application to the people of Israel; verse 26, however, to the Gentiles, who are not called His people, but "sons of the living God.<a name=367:27></a>" Peter, writing to the Jews, quotes only the first passage.<a name=367:28></a> Paul brings forward besides a passage from the prophet Isaiah, in proof of God's having foreseen and predicted the setting aside of Israel.<a name=367:29></a> A remnant only should be spared; had this not been the case they would have "been as Sodom, and been made like unto Gomorrha.<a name=367:30></a>"

		The Gentiles, who followed not after righteousness, had then attained to righteousness, but the righteousness which is of faith; whilst Israel, following after the law of righteousness, missed the mark.<a name=368:1></a> And why?<a name=368:2></a> Because they sought righteousness by means of the law, and not by faith.<a name=368:3></a> "For they stumbled at that stumbling-stone; as it is written, Behold, I lay in Zion a stumbling-stone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.<a name=368:4></a>"

		The apostle then enters more fully into this subject -- the difference between legal righteousness, and that which is by faith, the righteousness of <i>God</i>.<a name=368:5></a> This is of the utmost importance.<a name=368:6></a> Legal righteousness is <i>human</i> righteousness.<a name=368:7></a> True, there is no such thing; but conscience feels, and rightly so, that man must have righteousness.<a name=368:8></a> Where there is confidence in self, one presumes to accomplish this righteousness, and to be able to offer it for God's acceptance.<a name=368:9></a> That man is responsible is perfectly true; but not only has he never fulfilled his responsibility, but he has not even made a beginning, because the flesh is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.<a name=368:10></a> The carnal man is contrary to God.<a name=368:11></a> The righteousness of God is in God Himself, in His being; it is exercised in grace towards men, and imputed to them through Christ.<a name=368:12></a> One's own righteousness is nothing but pride and want of conscience; it is only found where the heart is not divinely enlightened.<a name=368:13></a> For the light of God gives us clearly to know that we are sinners, and brings this upon the conscience before God.<a name=368:14></a> In this light the law also, applied by the Holy Spirit, can convince of sin, but it cannot produce righteousness for us; for the ministry of the law is the ministry of death and condemnation; 2 Corinthians 3.<a name=368:15></a>

		The righteousness of <i>God</i> is revealed in the gospel (Romans 1: 17); and we have become this righteousness in Christ; 2 Corinthians 5: 21.<a name=369:1></a> Let us examine how this has taken place.<a name=369:2></a> On the cross Christ was made sin for us, and there bore all the believer's sins.<a name=369:3></a> In this position He perfectly glorified God -- His majesty, truth, righteousness against sin, His love to sinners, yea, all that He is; and that by having proved His obedience unto death, and His love to His Father in perfect self-sacrifice.<a name=369:4></a> The <i>proof</i> of the righteousness of God, and that with regard to what He is in Himself, to what sin is, and what it is in relation to Him, is now shewn in God's having glorified Christ, who perfectly glorified Him in all that He is, in this place of sin, where by man's sin, all this had been dishonoured; and His having set at His own right hand the Man who died -- His own Son -- and crowned Him with divine glory.<a name=369:5></a> This is what the Lord says in view of His death after Satan had entered into Judas.<a name=369:6></a> "Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.<a name=369:7></a> If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him," John 13: 31, 32.<a name=369:8></a> The Son of man has glorified God on the cross, and God has glorified Him with Himself.<a name=369:9></a> A man is ascended into the glory of God.<a name=369:10></a> (See John 17: 4, 5; Philippians 2: 5-11.<a name=369:11></a>) The righteousness of God has been revealed in that He has given Christ, who glorified Him, a place with Himself in divine glory.<a name=369:12></a> In John 16: 10 this is expressly declared.<a name=369:13></a> The descent and presence of the Holy Ghost upon earth is the proof of righteousness, because, since it did not believe on the Son, but had rejected Him, there was none in the world.<a name=369:14></a> The presence of the Saviour in heaven at the right hand of God is, likewise, the proof of the righteousness of God: the same Person who was rejected by the world, has been accepted by God, and is now, as come in grace, for ever separated from the world.<a name=369:15></a>

		The apostle then quotes a passage from the Book of Deuteronomy (chapter 30: 12-14), on which I would say a word.<a name=371:1></a> Moses had in this book declared the commandments of God, to the observance of which was attached the possession of the land into which Israel should be introduced.<a name=371:2></a> He had presented the blessings as consequent upon obedience, and the curse as consequent upon disobedience.<a name=371:3></a> Then in the chapter quoted (chapter 30) it is presupposed that Israel, in consequence of their disobedience, would lose the land; and a promise is given as to what the mercy of the Lord would do, after the people, languishing in captivity, are through grace brought to repentance.<a name=371:4></a> As this promise will be fulfilled in Christ, the apostle applies verses 12-14 to Christ.<a name=371:5></a> It is impossible for Israel to fulfil the law in a strange land; but when the people return in heart and in obedience to Jehovah, then God will bless them, although the law could not be observed.<a name=371:6></a> And since the <i>doing</i> of the law was impossible, this blessing will take place on the ground of a righteousness which is of faith, as Paul shews in verse 6.<a name=371:7></a> Therefore Christ, being Himself for the Jew the object of hope, is here introduced as the restorer of the nation.<a name=371:8></a> The apostle says it is not necessary to go far, to ascend or descend, to find Christ.<a name=371:9></a> If the word, which, according to the power of the Holy Ghost, reveals Christ as risen from among the dead, is in the heart; if in sincerity of heart one confesses Him, one is saved.<a name=371:10></a> "For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth [that is to say openly] confession is made unto salvation.<a name=371:11></a>" And this applies to the Gentiles quite as much as to the Jews, for "whosoever believeth on him [whoever he may be] shall not be ashamed.<a name=371:12></a>" There is no difference between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich in grace towards all that call upon Him.<a name=371:13></a> How beautiful this verse is when one compares it with chapter 3: 22, 23.<a name=371:14></a> There, there is no difference, for all have sinned; here, no difference, for the same Lord over all is rich in grace towards all that call upon Him.<a name=371:15></a> "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved" (verse 13).<a name=371:16></a> But to be able to call upon Him one must believe on Him; and to be able to believe on Him, one must have heard of Him; but to hear of Him, He must be preached, and for that there must be a preacher.<a name=371:17></a> As it is written: "How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!<a name=371:18></a>" (verse 15); that is to say, divine blessings.<a name=371:19></a> But all have not obeyed the gospel, as Isaiah says: "Lord, who hath believed our report?<a name=371:20></a>" So then, faith is by a report, the report is by the word of God.<a name=371:21></a>

		Israel is the subject of God's counsels.<a name=372:11></a> God does not cast away what He has foreknown and appointed to blessing.<a name=372:12></a> This rests upon positive grace; God does not change His counsels though Israel have no righteousness.<a name=372:13></a> The righteousness of God will save him.<a name=372:14></a> God is faithful, if all men are liars.<a name=372:15></a> "I say then," says the apostle, "God hath not cast away his people.<a name=372:16></a>" The apostle gives three proofs of this truth.<a name=372:17></a> First, there was a remnant according to election; next, salvation is come unto the Gentiles to provoke the Jews to jealousy: thirdly, the Deliverer shall come out of Zion to turn away the ungodliness of Israel.<a name=372:18></a>

		We have here much to consider.<a name=372:19></a> The first proof was that there was a remnant.<a name=372:20></a> The apostle gives the instance of Elijah.<a name=372:21></a> The faithful prophet believed that he alone remained of godly men.<a name=372:22></a> Faithful though he was, this was pure unbelief.<a name=372:23></a> God had reserved for Himself seven thousand that had not bowed down to Baal.<a name=372:24></a> The eye of God better knew how to discern His own, was more faithful in taking account of them, than was the faith of the prophet, dismayed by the threats of Jezebel, to seek them out and find them.<a name=372:25></a> And so at the time of the apostle there was a remnant according to the election of grace.<a name=372:26></a> But if it was according to grace, it was not according to works, otherwise grace was no more grace.<a name=372:27></a> Thus Israel had not obtained what he sought for.<a name=372:28></a> The election had obtained it.<a name=372:29></a> The others were blinded, and that according to the words of the prophet; Isaiah 29: 10.<a name=372:30></a> What David had said was confirmed by the words of the prophet.<a name=372:31></a> Their table would become a snare and a trap unto them.<a name=372:32></a> Did they then stumble that they should fall?<a name=372:33></a> By no means.<a name=372:34></a> Rather through their fall salvation had come unto the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy.<a name=372:35></a> Now, if their fall had become the riches of the Gentiles and of the world, how much more their fulness!<a name=372:36></a> Consequently the apostle of the Gentiles magnified his office, because it served to provoke Israel to jealousy.<a name=372:37></a> He sought thereby to constrain some of them to this jealousy.<a name=372:38></a> For if the casting away of them were the reconciling of the world, what would the receiving of them be?<a name=372:39></a> For they shall certainly be brought back.<a name=372:40></a> But this gives occasion to the statement of the relation borne to the Jews by the Gentiles that were accepted, and of the responsibility of the latter in the position in which they were placed: a statement covering principles of the highest importance.<a name=372:41></a><a href="#372:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>

		ROMANS 7 AND 8
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To understand well any part of Scripture we must not take an isolated passage (though, when understood, such may be rich in edification) but read, as we should in every writing, each passage with its context, and in its place.<a name=374:1></a> It is with this view that, in treating of Romans 7 and 8, I take a rapid survey of the structure of the whole Epistle.<a name=374:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		After an introduction, stating what the Gospel of God is about, and his interest in the Romans, the apostle proves and dissects the sinful state of Gentiles, philosophising moralists, and, finally, Jews; admitting the external advantages possessed by the latter, but using even these to bring them in guilty, and thus have every mouth stopped, and all the world guilty before God.<a name=374:3></a> This guilt he shews to be met by the blood of Christ.<a name=374:4></a> All that the old man is or has done, Jew or Gentile, lawless or under law, is met by the work of the Redeemer on the cross, whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in His blood; accounting thus, in righteousness, for the remission of past sins, and setting forth, as a present standing, the righteousness of God thus declared.<a name=374:5></a> The great roots of Jewish hope and glory, Abraham and David, testified to the same truth of justification by faith.<a name=374:6></a> But another principle is now brought in: faith, not in a dying Saviour, but in God that raises the dead -- not the meeting the sins of the old man by propitiation through blood, but God coming in, as perfectly glorified by that work, to deliver completely from that state, and shew us Christ raised from the dead.<a name=374:7></a> Abraham believed that God could so perform His promise; we believe <i>He has</i> raised up Christ, who was delivered for our offences and raised up again for our justification (chapter 1-4).<a name=374:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The resurrection of Christ, His being raised by the power of God after being delivered for our offences, forms the ground of the following chapters.<a name=374:9></a> It is not only atonement for sin, but bringing man into a new state by the power of God, perfectly accepted, consequent on Christ's being delivered for our offences.<a name=374:10></a> But in this Epistle the apostle only sees the fact in Christ, not our being raised with Him.<a name=374:11></a> Thus, however, we have peace with God through faith, and have our portion in the glory of God, being reconciled to Him by the death of His Son.<a name=374:12></a> The blessing flows to men from the Second Adam through faith, as the judgment from the first through sin.<a name=374:13></a> The law came in by the bye, that the offence might abound; chapter 5.<a name=374:14></a>

		Chapter 6 applies the same principle to Christian life.<a name=375:1></a> The flesh pretended, being (it would make us believe) very jealous for God's holiness, that if <i>Christ's</i> obedience was the one means of righteousness before God, we might continue in sin.<a name=375:2></a> This, while pretending to care for holiness, is the confession, that, if not restrained by fear, and if God shews man grace, man is so irreparably bad that he will only seek evil.<a name=375:3></a> I admit it; but God would have hearts; and the spirit of bondage again to fear is not His way of sanctifying.<a name=375:4></a> What then is the answer?<a name=375:5></a> You are dead with Christ; but one who is, cannot be alive in that to which he is dead.<a name=375:6></a> "In that Christ died, he died unto sin once; in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.<a name=375:7></a> Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=375:8></a>" Thus Christ's resurrection had been applied to justifying and to newness of life, we being accounted, and to account ourselves, dead unto sin.<a name=375:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 7 applies this principle to the case of law.<a name=375:10></a> It is that we have now to consider.<a name=375:11></a> Law has dominion over a man as long as he lives; but we have died in Christ, and its dominion is closed with our life.<a name=375:12></a> We are to another, Christ raised from the dead.<a name=375:13></a> This is the principle.<a name=375:14></a> The chapter is divided into four parts.<a name=375:15></a> The first is the great principle we have just stated (vers.<a name=375:16></a> 1-3); the second is its actual application to those under law (vers.<a name=375:17></a> 4-6); the operation of law on a man under it, man having <i>lusts</i> (vers.<a name=375:18></a> 7-12); the experience of a man under law, though renewed in the desires of his mind, viewed in the light of Christian knowledge, that is, by a person out of that condition (verse 13-24).<a name=375:19></a> The last verse arrives at the deliverance, and the abstract principle brought to light by all this.<a name=375:20></a>

		Nothing, after all, can be simpler than the principle the apostle lays down, and which he exemplifies under the figure of marriage.<a name=375:21></a> Law has power over a man as long as he lives; has he died?<a name=375:22></a> the law binds him no longer.<a name=375:23></a> Thus, a woman is bound by the law under which she is to her husband, as long as he lives; but if death comes in, the bond has ceased, and she is free.<a name=375:24></a> Now we have died in Christ, that is the theme of chapters 6 and 7.<a name=375:25></a> We have died therefore to the law by the body of Christ (that is, in Christ's death), that we should have another husband, Christ raised from the dead.<a name=375:26></a> The two -- law and a risen Christ -- cannot have authority over us together, and this second marriage is alone fruitful.<a name=375:27></a> The Christian, then, is distinctly held to have died, and thus to have ceased to be under the law, and <i>that</i> by the body of Christ; and to be to another, the risen Christ.<a name=375:28></a>

		Consequently he is not in the flesh -- in the first Adam -- and the responsibilities which attach to him; nor under law, even if he had been, because the bond of the law ceased with the life it had its claim over.<a name=376:1></a> Hence the next paragraph turns back as to a past time, when it speaks of the state of man under the law, and still alive in the bond of the first husband.<a name=376:2></a> "My brethren, ye are become dead to the law .<a name=376:3></a>.<a name=376:4></a>.<a name=376:5></a> for <i>when we were</i> in the flesh the motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members.<a name=376:6></a>" When we were in that condition, as alive in the first Adam state and under law, the motions of sin were working, set in activity, as an occasion, by the law.<a name=376:7></a> Flesh and law are correlatives, save in the case of mere wicked lawlessness.<a name=376:8></a> But <i>now</i> we are delivered from the law, having died in that (not that being dead) in which we were held.<a name=376:9></a> We <i>were</i>, as thus alive, under the bond of our first husband -- law.<a name=376:10></a> But we have died and the bond has ceased -- cannot exist, for we are to another.<a name=376:11></a> Thus we have the doctrine and its application to us, the cessation of relationship with the law, its bond and authority over us, by our having died in Christ, and this state brought more strongly out by our being to another, Christ risen from the dead; but hereby the character of our service changed, it is in newness of Spirit, not in oldness of the letter.<a name=376:12></a>

		The apostle now proceeds to discuss the operation of law on man in the flesh.<a name=376:13></a> Is the law to be charged with being sin because the motions of sin, as he had said, were by it?<a name=376:14></a> That is not it all; but this is true, he would not have known sin but for the law.<a name=376:15></a> No doubt, if he had been a criminal, natural conscience might have pressed on him.<a name=376:16></a> But he would not have known lust unless the law had said, "Thou shalt not lust.<a name=376:17></a>" Crimes, sins against natural conscience, he might have felt; but sin would have been hidden from him -- inward sin, lust, his state of sin.<a name=376:18></a> For of this the apostle specially speaks as the real question.<a name=376:19></a> In his own case he was blameless.<a name=376:20></a> Often the work is much deeper and more painful when there is only inward sin.<a name=376:21></a> A wicked sinner stops at the outward fruits, sees his guilt, and that it is gone.<a name=376:22></a> The man in whom evil is more refined sees it more twisted round his heart and difficult to overcome.<a name=376:23></a> The wicked man, no doubt, will have to judge lust; but often, if he is tempted by it and resists, he is happy in victory: the other is desolate because he finds it there.<a name=376:24></a> The inward man is far more exercised than in the case of positive wickedness.<a name=376:25></a> However, to have solid peace, the principle and root must be judged, and with this especially we have to do here.<a name=376:26></a>

		Chapter 3 had judged sins and applied the blood; we have now the discovering of sin in the flesh, a still more terrible enemy, one which presses on the spirit more than past sins, where the heart is in earnest.<a name=377:1></a> Through the precious blood of Christ we can understand that a God of love has forgiven the sins that are bygone and now not loved; but to have it still there as a principle, working in the shape of lust, this is a burden and a grief.<a name=377:2></a> How am I forgiven, how accepted, if this be so?<a name=377:3></a> Yet the flesh lusts.<a name=377:4></a> Natural conscience takes little heed of this.<a name=377:5></a> But the law comes and says, "Thou shalt not lust.<a name=377:6></a>" Sin profits by this prohibition, attacks the conscience; it says to us, There, you have broken the law, you are under the curse.<a name=377:7></a> And so, as far as that goes, we are.<a name=377:8></a> The conscience was easy, felt no judgment of death on it, till the law came; but when the commandment came, sin took fresh vigour -- took the commandment as a base of attack against the conscience, and brought the sentence of death upon the soul.<a name=377:9></a> And the law which was to life -- for it said, Do this and live -- the soul finds to be to death.<a name=377:10></a> These two, then, are the effects of law upon living man, man in the flesh.<a name=377:11></a> It provokes concupiscence, it brings death on the conscience.<a name=377:12></a> Sin profits by the commandment, which, by restraining, rouses the will and suggests the lust, to deceive and slay the soul.<a name=377:13></a> Was it then the fault of the law?<a name=377:14></a> No; the law was holy, just, and good.<a name=377:15></a> Was that which was good the cause of death?<a name=377:16></a> No; but it brought out into evidence the true character of sin, that turned what was good into death; and sin by the commandment became exceeding sinful.<a name=377:17></a> Such is the operation of law on a man having lusts and self-will, that is, on every child of Adam who comes under it.<a name=377:18></a> Such is man in the flesh under law.<a name=377:19></a>

		The apostle now turns to the way the actual experience of one in this condition presents itself to him who, being free, can calmly estimate the working of a soul in that state; can read aright what passes in it; who knows what law is, being partaker of divine teaching in a spiritual nature; and can judge what flesh is, because he is not under its influence.<a name=377:20></a> We, we Christians, know that the law is spiritual, but he does not say "we" (that would be saying Christians were carnal, as such, whereas they are spiritual men), but "I am carnal [he puts the case], sold under sin.<a name=377:21></a>" That is the man in the flesh under law.<a name=377:22></a> What the reader has to remark here is, that the whole subject is the law, and that Christ and the Spirit are not mentioned.<a name=377:23></a> He consents to the law that it is good, delights in it after the inner man, but knows nothing of redemption or the Spirit.<a name=377:24></a> His husband is the first one -- the law; not the second -- the risen Christ.<a name=377:25></a>

		But we have fuller detail than this, experimental discovery of the truth of his state by the conflict that was going on.<a name=378:1></a> First of all, he has found a carnal "I," sold under sin; that is, captive to it as a slave, for he did not allow what he did, nor do what he would, but did what he hated.<a name=378:2></a> But if he would not do it, it was consenting in his will to the law that it was good; but if he did so consent, it was not that he was doing it, for he <i>would</i> not do it though he did.<a name=378:3></a> It was sin dwelling in him.<a name=378:4></a> Here the apostle teaches him the meaning of his experience.<a name=378:5></a> There is an "I" distinct from the sinful principle: an "I" that was not his flesh; and he could look at the sinful working of the flesh as being from sin that dwelt in him, not from the "I," which he was conscious was his own inmost will.<a name=378:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But he learnt another truth.<a name=378:7></a> In him as born of Adam, that is, in his flesh, there dwelt no good thing at all; for even when he willed to do good, the other was only a hindrance.<a name=378:8></a> To will was present with him, but how to perform that which was good he found not.<a name=378:9></a> But this brought out a second truth: he had no strength to do good when he willed to do it.<a name=378:10></a> For the good he willed he did not do, and the evil he hated that he did.<a name=378:11></a> In verse 20, the "I," in "I would not," is emphatic.<a name=378:12></a> So it is in "no more I that do it.<a name=378:13></a>" He now sees he does more than consent to the law in his conscience, he delights in it after the inward man, but another law in his members brings him into captivity.<a name=378:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But in all this he only thinks of law and self (I would, I do not; I hate, I do), not of Christ at all.<a name=378:15></a> But this serves, under the divine teaching which the apostle here gives us, to lead him to the discovery of, first the two natures; then that he is without strength, led captive by a law of sin which is in his members.<a name=378:16></a> There all his efforts end.<a name=378:17></a> But it is a great deal to learn: to get the knowledge of self, one's total want of strength, of the effect of being under law; to know enough of "I" to be glad to get rid of it.<a name=378:18></a> This is the process of Romans 7.<a name=378:19></a> Peace, by progress or by victory, so as to be content with self, is found to be impossible.<a name=378:20></a> One has to own one's sinfulness, and submit to the righteousness of God.<a name=378:21></a> It is not contentedness with one's state, but the discovery that one needs <i>deliverance</i>, the work of another.<a name=378:22></a> "O wretched man that I am!<a name=378:23></a>" Man is here emphatic -- such is the condition of <i>man</i>.<a name=378:24></a> If he be renewed in will and heart, with the sense of what he as man ought to be by the law, he is a man, and that is a being with evil lusts, under sin, led captive by it; one without strength for victory.<a name=378:25></a> But if our God has brought us to this consciousness of what we are -- has wrought this work of truth in us, the grace which has wrought it will not fail in completing its work, to give peace and rest of spirit in confidence and communion with God.<a name=378:26></a>

		I will say a few words on chapter 8, which we did not quite finish last week.<a name=389:1></a> We considered the three subjects it contains.<a name=389:2></a> First, The living work wrought in us connected with no condemnation.<a name=389:3></a> Second, Not merely the work that is wrought in us by the Holy Ghost, but the presence of the Holy Ghost Himself in us, as distinguishing between that which is born of the Spirit, and the personal indwelling of the Holy Ghost.<a name=389:4></a> Third, Not only what God has wrought, or is in me, but what God is for me in His outward operations.<a name=389:5></a>

		It is the third point which forms the subject of the closing part of chapter 8, which omits the work in us altogether, and brings forward the <i>security</i>, that is to say, what God is <i>for us</i>; which introduces the sovereign power of God acting in grace for us -- "whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate.<a name=389:6></a>" In this passage, sanctification and the whole work of the Spirit is therefore omitted (while it is fully brought out in other parts of chapter 8) and the apostle turns to God's foreknowledge, and what He is and does for them whom He foreknew.<a name=389:7></a> And mark, the foreknowledge here is that of <i>persons:</i> it is not said "what he foreknew" in them, or that, because of that, they should be predestinated; but "whom he did foreknow, he has also predestinated to be conformed.<a name=389:8></a>"

		In verse 29 we see what the wonderful thought of God about us is, that we should be conformed to the image of His Son.<a name=389:9></a> There is a spiritual conformity, even here, in the saints; but it does not stop at spiritual conformity, for the predestinating purpose of God was to conform them to Christ Himself.<a name=389:10></a> In the wonderful purpose of God He had set up the man Christ Jesus, in whom He took all His delight, in His presence in glory.<a name=389:11></a> Looking then at Christ as the second Man, we find that He has sanctified Himself, set Himself apart as the One to whom we are to be conformed.<a name=389:12></a> He has gone up into glory, and has sat down at the right hand of God, before the church is gathered; and although we do not yet see all things put under Him, we see the Man Jesus crowned with glory and honour.<a name=389:13></a> Now, "as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly"; for God's wonderful thought about us is, not only to bring us into His presence, but that our very bodies even should be conformed to the likeness of the glorious body of His dear Son, "that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.<a name=389:14></a>" For, as I have remarked before, it is not exactly the church, as a body, that is presented in Romans, but the individual relationship of the saint with God.<a name=389:15></a> As the brethren of the Lord Jesus, God has not only foreknown them, had His purposes and thoughts about them, but God has called them, and, through grace, they have listened.<a name=389:16></a> God called them -- they became partakers before Him in blessing -- not by ordinances, nor yet by descent, but by His calling them; and here comes in another feature of God's character -- the activities of His own love in calling souls out of this evil world.<a name=389:17></a> "Whom he called, them he also justified"; for if God had foreknown these people, He has called them; not to reject them -- God Himself has done it; for I am not only justified before God, but it is God that justifies me.<a name=389:18></a> He will not have us in His presence with one sin upon us.<a name=389:19></a> It is His doing, to have us with Himself according to the purposes of His love and the holiness of His nature.<a name=389:20></a> If I am justified in His sight, it is God who justifies me, according to the perfectness with which He does everything.<a name=389:21></a> He speaks of it as a great fact (the inward working being left out here), as the wondrous basis on which He rests this justification -- it is on what <i>God is</i>, and in His own work.<a name=389:22></a> Indeed, it is observable in a most remarkable way all through this Epistle, how everything is made to rest on what <i>God is</i>.<a name=389:23></a> Man having been tried in every way, without law, under law, under grace, is brought out and proved to be good for nothing: then God comes in and acts in His own sovereignty, according to what He is.<a name=389:24></a> This shuts out the possibility of anything whatever, be it sin or Satan, coming in against us -- God is for us.<a name=389:25></a> This is the grand result which the soul discovers, and the Holy Ghost reasons from.<a name=389:26></a> The heart may argue, Why then am I finding all this tribulation if He so loves me -- if He be for me?<a name=389:27></a> But faith interprets the tribulation by the certainty of God's being for us, and is more than conqueror.<a name=389:28></a> Everything is made to rest on what God is; on this great leading truth, proved in His sovereign ways to us as sinners, ways rehearsed in the preceding verses, which shew what God is for us; and if God be for us, who can be against us, for who can put himself in competition with God?<a name=389:29></a> -- "is not this a brand plucked out of the burning?<a name=389:30></a>" If you ask a proof of God's being for us, the proof is, He gave His Son.<a name=389:31></a> If I come to God, and say, What will He do for such a wretched sinner as I am?<a name=389:32></a> why, He has done more than the greatest sinner can ask, more than the greatest saint could think of, for He has given His Son for me; therefore, not only have we done with everything that was against us -- Satan, every accuser -- but the very sin that made me tremble, becomes a witness of the extent of the love of Him who is "for us.<a name=389:33></a>" There it is I have learnt it: for He has shewn Himself for me in justifying me.<a name=389:34></a> But if God be thus for us about our sins, we may count freely for all the rest.<a name=389:35></a> "He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him freely give us all things?<a name=389:36></a>"

		The great secret in the Epistle is, that man is reduced as low as he possibly could be, that is, to his own real level, being proved to be everything that is bad, feeble, and good for nothing; and then God comes in in grace, and says, That is what God is for you; and this gives the heart quietness, and sets the conscience in full liberty, in virtue of the resurrection of Jesus, and closes it up from all questionings by shewing that that on which it rests is outside man altogether -- based on the stability of God Himself; and brought out in the work and Person of Christ; though a real work be wrought in the soul to enable it to enjoy it.<a name=392:1></a> God is in us, and for us, and has brought down everything to meet our daily need in Christ; and we can only adore, and wonder; and yet it ceases to be wonderful when we see it is God's doing: we know He must do something superlatively great to shew the exceeding riches of His grace; what He does returns up to Him again in adoration and praise: yet goodness, acting in its own sovereignty, must do something which is above all praise.<a name=392:2></a> As in Psalm 84, where we get the double blessing, "blessed are they that dwell in thy house, they will be still praising thee.<a name=392:3></a>" In the house -- there where God is -- is the first and proper blessing; there there is nothing but praise.<a name=392:4></a> Then, "blessed is the man whose strength is in God" -- the strength needed by the way -- "in whose heart are the ways of [that is, the way to] God": for having learned grace here, we shall learn glory there.<a name=392:5></a> Let us now turn to chapter 9.<a name=392:6></a>

		The first thing in the Epistle to the Romans is, that the apostle reduces man to his true level as a sinner, whether under or without law; and this is met by the bloodshedding spoken of in chapter 3.<a name=393:1></a> Then chapter 4 brings out faith in God who raiseth the dead -- not my working to meet God, but believing in God who had come in with power and raised the One who was under the power of death and set Him at His own right hand.<a name=393:2></a> In chapter 5 we get this faith applied to justification; the results of His being delivered for our offences and raised again, are given -- we are saved; thus assured of love we are able to joy in tribulation, and, the grand result of all, in God Himself.<a name=393:3></a> In chapter 6, we are dead to sin.<a name=393:4></a> In chapter 7, dead to the law: and in chapter 8, we have the full liberty of the Christian.<a name=393:5></a> Chapter 8 being the summary of the whole Christian position, the result for the believer of the work of God in grace.<a name=393:6></a> God acting in the power of His love, brings us into His presence in the Person of Christ; being justified we get liberty, and God, in His own sovereign power of grace shuts us up in the ark -- I mean, in Christ -- in the security of His own grace.<a name=393:7></a> But then comes in a difficulty: what becomes, not merely of the broken law, but of the special promises made to the Jews?<a name=393:8></a> If Jews and Gentiles are thus reduced to one moral level, how are we to reconcile the fact of the unconditional promises made to the Jews, such as those made to Abraham in Genesis 15, 17 and 18?<a name=393:9></a> This difficulty is met in chapters 9, 10 and 11.<a name=393:10></a>

		In chapter 9, the apostle speaks of the absolute sovereignty of God.<a name=393:11></a> The potter may do what he pleases with the clay.<a name=393:12></a> The question is, not what God has done, but His title to do what pleaseth Him.<a name=393:13></a> The close of chapters 9 and 10 brings out how the Jews' own prophets had forewarned them of what would come to pass.<a name=393:14></a> It was a known scriptural thing, Israel's failure and consequent rejection.<a name=393:15></a> But though it is the will of God to deal thus with them, He will never give them up; as we see in chapter 11, that Israel are still God's beloved earthly people.<a name=393:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The sovereignty of God being asserted does not affect the apostle's love to Israel; as he says, "I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost, that I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart: for I could wish myself accursed," or, "I have wished myself accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh"; for this is the force of verse 3; that instead of despising his brethren, a charge the Jews were perpetually bringing against him, the real impulse of his heart had led him -- not in cool reflection, for the thing was impossible, but in the earnestness of his soul in love to them -- to express a feeling that never could be accomplished indeed, though spoken in earnestness, but which proved that Paul loved them quite as much as Moses ever loved them, and was willing, as far as affection went, to be like Christ, an anathema "for his brethren, his kinsmen according to the flesh.<a name=393:17></a>"

		Here you see the power of divine love, which is willing to be and do anything and everything for those whom it would serve.<a name=394:1></a> It seeks all the good it can find in its true object -- affection must do so; though the same affection may make it earnest in reproof.<a name=394:2></a> Just as the same Paul says to the Corinthians, who were convicted of sin not found among the Gentiles, "I thank my God on your behalf, that in everything ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge; so that ye come behind in no gift, waiting for the coming of the Lord.<a name=394:3></a>" Yet when he visits them, he will not spare; he will come with a rod.<a name=394:4></a> He gets at their consciences by opening their hearts to their privileges, and then he can rebuke them, when the will has been broken down by the sense of the love.<a name=394:5></a> You will be ready to say yourselves, However can such a favoured people act thus?<a name=394:6></a> And they felt that if he had not been forced to rebuke them, he would never have rebuked them at all; and thus what he said came home with additional weight and power on the conscience.<a name=394:7></a> So here Paul speaks to them of all that he can, "Ye are Israelites, to whom pertain the adoption, the glory, and the covenants.<a name=394:8></a>" Do not you suppose that I want to undervalue your promises: I hold them up.<a name=394:9></a> You Israelites do not value them as you ought, you do not know them; you do not know that you have God over all, blessed for ever, for your Messiah.<a name=394:10></a>

		It is thus, I believe, we should deal with poor Jews now.<a name=394:11></a> "God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew.<a name=394:12></a>" For a time, indeed, they are set aside as a nation, in order to reconcile the world; and they are considered in their nature and condition of sinners as levelled to the condition of the Gentiles, the apostle having proved in chapter 3 that they are both alike under sin.<a name=394:13></a> But here the apostle reconciles the fact of the unconditional promises made to the Jews, with this doctrine as to their common sinfulness with the Gentiles, and he proves that they will have the promises in a much higher way than they could have had them at first; and while bringing both Jew and Gentile alike under sin, he raises up God above His promises (though He will accomplish them, of course, though Israel had forfeited all title to them, for it had rejected them when their accomplishment was presented in the Person of Jesus), and shews Israel from their own history that they must leave God to His sovereignty, or else they must lose their promises; and then that in the exercise of this sovereignty He will let in the Gentiles, as well as the Jews.<a name=394:14></a> They would have them by descent, which, of course, excluded the Gentiles.<a name=394:15></a> If, says Paul, you Israelites will take your promises by descent, we will just see what comes of it.<a name=394:16></a> You say, we be Abraham's seed, and have a right to the promises by descent; for these Gentiles are but dogs, and have no right to share with us in God's promises.<a name=394:17></a> Well, if God has His sovereignty, He will in grace let in these Gentile dogs.<a name=394:18></a> But now I will prove to you that you cannot take the promises by descent.<a name=394:19></a> In the first place, "they are not all Israel which are of Israel"; yet if it is by descent you must take in all Abraham's seed.<a name=394:20></a> And if you take in Abraham's children, then you must take in Ishmael -- those Arabians.<a name=394:21></a> Oh no, say they, we cannot allow that; what!<a name=394:22></a> Ishmaelites in the congregation of Israel, and heirs of promise?<a name=394:23></a> Yes, if by descent.<a name=394:24></a> If you do not take it by descent, you must take it by grace; and if it is by grace, God will not confine this grace to you, but will exercise it toward the Gentiles.<a name=394:25></a>

		When Moses pleads with God for Israel, notwithstanding all their departure from God, yet Moses identifies them with God, and says, "Thy people which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt"; while God calls them the mediator's people.<a name=397:1></a> Remark here, in passing, one thing most beautiful to observe: God, after first threatening to consume them, by coming up into the midst of them in a moment, (chapter 33: 5), had said (verse 3), "I will not go up in the midst of thee, for thou art a stiff-necked people.<a name=397:2></a>" Yet Moses says in chapter 34: 9, "If now I have found grace in thy sight, O Lord, let my Lord, I pray thee, go up amongst us, for it is a stiff-necked people.<a name=397:3></a> Grace had come in in the interval, God's goodness had passed before him.<a name=397:4></a> This changed all, and the people being so stiff-necked, Moses says, we cannot do without God; so that Moses, when once the foundation of grace is laid, makes the very condition of the people, which would have led God to consume them, or at least not go amongst them, the reason for God's going up amongst them.<a name=397:5></a> It is a question of who is to go up; therefore Moses says, Do thou, O God, go with us.<a name=397:6></a> Grace had come in and therefore he could say to God, Go with us; thus bringing in God for us.<a name=397:7></a> The moment grace is brought in, even in the way of government (and here the question is one of government), we feel that our very sinfulness is a reason why the presence of God cannot be dispensed with.<a name=397:8></a>

		We will now turn again to the subject of descent.<a name=398:1></a> We have seen Paul saying, If you Jews will have the promises by descent, then you must let in the Ishmaelites and Edomites; and, on the other hand, if you say you will have them by righteousness, you know that if God had dealt with you in righteousness there would not have been one of you here at this moment; say now (and you, my reader, ask yourself the question), will you be willing to be dealt with in righteousness?<a name=398:2></a> No, you would not; then do not you talk about it, until you can go to God on that footing.<a name=398:3></a> But if, says Paul to Israel, you still say, We will have the promises by righteousness, the golden calf has proved, at the very outset, that you cannot have them on that ground, and that your mouth must be for ever closed.<a name=398:4></a> But if you have such a conviction of sin as stops your mouth about righteousness, and so excludes all boasting, you will rejoice in the "mercy" and "compassion" of God, who retreats into His own sovereignty, that He may know how to spare; because in thus sovereignty He can shew mercy.<a name=398:5></a> If I am convicted in my heart of sin, I shall be glad enough to hear of grace, be it ever so sovereign: "So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.<a name=398:6></a>" God is not bound up to righteousness; He can shew mercy, and "whom he will he hardeneth.<a name=398:7></a>"

but if we do not let God have His right and proper place, who is to set things in order when sin has brought in disorder?<a name=399:2></a> The mark that a soul is right, morally right, is saying, I am a sinner, deserving everlasting destruction, and all my trust is in sovereign goodness.<a name=399:3></a> Faith says, I was bringing on myself "swift destruction," but God's grace stopped me;

but the passage simply asserts His prerogative, His title to make of the same lump what He pleases, and that unqualifiedly and fully.<a name=399:7></a> But God does bear with these wicked men, as He said to Israel, by the mouth of the prophet Isaiah, "thou hast made me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities" (chapter 43: 24).<a name=399:8></a> Then again by the prophet Amos, "behold I am pressed under you, as a cart is pressed that is full of sheaves" (chapter 2: 13).<a name=399:9></a> Thus God "endures with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction," willing to shew His wrath and make His power known.<a name=399:10></a> But when speaking of mercy, the apostle instantly brings God in; "that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory.<a name=399:11></a>" It is moral dealing here, and not mere cold barren doctrine.<a name=399:12></a> We see how God deals with these vessels which He had afore prepared unto glory, and then how He endures with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction.<a name=399:13></a> And again, mark, that it does not say that these vessels of wrath were afore prepared for destruction, neither does it merely say that the vessels of mercy were fitted unto glory.<a name=399:14></a> No; for the vessels of mercy were afore prepared of God unto glory, while the vessels of wrath are fitted to destruction by their iniquities having come to the "full.<a name=399:15></a>" But whatever there is of good must come from God, and God only; the evil, alas!<a name=399:16></a> is already in us.<a name=399:17></a> But if the question still be put, Why has God been bearing with this wickedness, and only at last shewn out His wrath in those vessels fitted to destruction?<a name=399:18></a> The answer is, that after He has proved the ways of men, and shewn all shut up under judgment, He then comes in with mercy, sovereign mercy; and so the apostle applies it.<a name=399:19></a> Cannot He then let in the Gentiles?<a name=399:20></a> Surely; for if God is setting up vessels of mercy, He can prepare a Gentile as well as a Jew.<a name=399:21></a> If the Jews, in their folly, arraigned God's sovereignty -- very well, says the apostle, let them have righteousness, and where then will they be?<a name=399:22></a> and having proved that law and descent have both failed as a title, he shews, if you Jews will not let in the Gentiles, you must yourselves be shut out.<a name=399:23></a> For if, they will not bow to God's sovereignty, let them take Sinai, where they have lost all title to all the promises, and are thus necessarily thrown on the ground of God's doing what He pleases, or on judgment.<a name=399:24></a> God forces them to own this, that He may call in the Gentiles; as God says in Hosea, "and it shall come to pass, that in the <i>place</i> where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, there shall they be called the children of the living God.<a name=399:25></a>" Romans 9: 25 is the call of the Jews, and verse 26 the call of the Gentiles.<a name=399:26></a> Verse 25 calls the Jews from the Lo-ruhamah and the Lo-ammi state of Israel.<a name=399:27></a> (See Hosea 1: 6, 9.<a name=399:28></a>) But in verse 26 it is the call of the Gentiles; it being the special and proper privilege indeed of the Gentiles to be called the sons of the living God, but not to be His people as a specific title.<a name=399:29></a> Thus in the very place where Lo-ammi was universally applied, the blessed title of the sons of the living God -- for indeed it was by spiritual life -- became the portion of the called, according to Hosea 1, latter part of verse 10.<a name=399:30></a> And this is confirmed by the fact of Peter's only quoting, in his writing to the dispersed of Israel who believed, the closing part of verse 23 of Hosea 2; the very same that is quoted in Romans 9: 25; because Peter refers to the Jews only, and therefore only takes up those who, having been Ammi (my people) had become Lo-ammi (not my people); and though Ruhamah (mercy) had become Lo-ruhamah (no mercy) -- but having obtained mercy, have become Ammi and Ruhamah, which they will continue to be in the millennium, after being as a nation brought back to God.<a name=399:31></a> While Paul, speaking of the Gentiles as well as the Jews, quotes in Romans 9: 26, the latter part of Hosea 1: 10 also; "and it shall come to pass in that place," etc.<a name=399:32></a>; so that these verses are taken by Paul to shew the whole bearing of the argument as to the calling of Jews and Gentiles, as well as peculiar mercy to Israel.<a name=399:33></a> In verse 27, Isaiah is introduced, clearly shewing the actual setting aside of the people as a body by the judgment of God, whatever mercy might be in store for them.<a name=399:34></a>

		To us, all this is very simple, having become familiar to our minds; but to them, it must have been a tremendous and inexplicable thing that God's people should be set aside as to the actual administration of God's government on the earth.<a name=401:1></a> While God has no earthly people, He gives up the earth, as to immediate law (while providentially watching over events, of course).<a name=401:2></a> While Israel were God's people, on the earth, there was a direct interference of God as to executive government on the earth; but now God is not dealing with His people on the earth as for the earth, but as a heavenly people -- a mystery.<a name=401:3></a> God's power was shewn on the earth, but now God has given up the government of a people on the earth, and taken up a heavenly people -- "blest with all spiritual blessings, in heavenly places in Christ.<a name=401:4></a>" Israel for a season is set aside; and Christ, the only door by which any can be saved, being exalted on high, the calling is that of a distinct people, not for the earth, but for heaven; and therefore the word is, "If any man will come after me, let him take up his cross and follow me.<a name=401:5></a>" The idea of Christ having members on earth while He, the Head, is in heaven, no Jew would have understood; and before the Jew will own this in his conscience, they must be brought to see that they have been cut off for rejecting their Messiah.<a name=401:6></a> And the earth also is guilty; as having rejected God's Son; and for this, God, "will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness, because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.<a name=401:7></a>" Well, dear friends, are you prepared for God to make a short work on the earth?<a name=401:8></a> But we know it will not be till after the last elect one of the church is gathered in; and if we are "keeping the word of his patience," He will keep us from the hour of temptation; and, meanwhile, He has set before us an open door, that no one can shut.<a name=401:9></a> In verse 32, "they sought it not by faith" -- "Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness: wherefore?<a name=401:10></a> because they sought it not by faith.<a name=401:11></a>" Israel did not keep the law; and when the object of faith came, Him they crucified, so that, although to Israel the promises were given, we have seen how they were forfeited by them, as far as their title went to the promise.<a name=401:12></a> And here is the wonderful wisdom of God shewn out in bringing failing Israel, and the poor Gentile dogs, both in alike on the ground of <i>sovereign grace</i>.<a name=401:13></a> One had not got the promise, the other refused it when presented to them in Christ; so that both should be objects of mere mercy.<a name=401:14></a>

		In principle, all these great truths are for our own souls.<a name=403:1></a> The history of the world is the history of an individual soul.<a name=403:2></a> And God has taken pains to detail elaborately that wherein we may read ourselves as in a glass, and see that we are shut up to grace; and having come to that, nothing can separate us from the love of God.<a name=403:3></a> It depends on sovereign goodness; therefore I lean on what God is for me, and not on what I am for God.<a name=403:4></a> The moment our souls are brought to God, we find that Christ has more than overcome in love and put away all the evil we have learnt of ourselves, bringing His love into it.<a name=403:5></a> The ways, purposes, counsels, and power of God for man can never fail.<a name=403:6></a>

		The Lord give us understanding, a divine understanding, of all His thoughts and ways; and let not our thoughts and affections be running out after the world, that does not know Him, nor yet the hidden mystery which He reveals to those who love Him; but may our hearts and souls know God Himself in all these things!<a name=403:7></a> They are precious and valuable, because they are the various parts which make up the glory of the Lord Jesus: therefore valuable because they belong to Him.<a name=403:8></a>

		NOTE ON THE APPLICATION OF THE TYPES OF THE RED SEA AND JORDAN
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>April</i>, 1881.<a name=404:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To the Editor of "THINGS NEW AND OLD," <p>I do not doubt that your whole desire is to put things scripturally, and that you will bear with me in stating that I think what you say in the article of Correspondence, entitled J.<a name=404:2></a>H.<a name=404:3></a>, Fenihirst, is not scriptural.<a name=404:4></a> It is possible that you might find a similar statement in some of my former writings where the points were not so clear to my mind.<a name=404:5></a> Yet I think I ever held the Red Sea to be Christ dead and risen for us, and Jordan we dead and risen with Christ.<a name=404:6></a> I took this ground in the Archer Street conference and it was resisted on ground like your article, and I examined it afresh.<a name=404:7></a> Only, in my case, if it were so, it was merely want of being clear, while a whole system is now made to hang upon what is not correct.<a name=404:8></a> The theory is that the passover was Christ's dying for us, the Red Sea our death with Christ, and Jordan our death and resurrection in Him.<a name=404:9></a> All this, except the first, is wrong.<a name=404:10></a> First, there is no dying in Christ, nor such a distinction as with Him and in Him.<a name=404:11></a> If a person long exercised said, 'O, I see I died in Christ,' I should be delighted.<a name=404:12></a> He has seen his deliverance, though he expresses it wrongly.<a name=404:13></a> But the difference is real and practical.<a name=404:14></a> When we die with Christ, it is we, "I am crucified," a real experimental thing, not judicial, though we get liberty by seeing it accomplished in Christ.<a name=404:15></a> So we are always dead to something, dead to sin, to the rudiments of the world, dead to the law.<a name=404:16></a> Scripture does say that we are <i>alive</i> in Christ, because that is an actual, subsisting thing; He is our life, we <i>are</i> in Christ.<a name=404:17></a>

		In the passover, there was one simple truth, God was passing through as a judge, and passed over, was shut out as such.<a name=404:18></a> The Red Sea is Christ's death, and resurrection -- more than mere non-imputation; Exodus 15: 13.<a name=404:19></a> It is redemption absolute and accomplished.<a name=404:20></a> God is a Saviour and deliverer; Exodus 14: 13.<a name=404:21></a> The Egyptians were to be seen no more.<a name=404:22></a> It was nothing done in us, but for us; the command was, "Stand still and see the salvation of the Lord.<a name=404:23></a>" Death and judgment were for God's people's deliverance, and the result was, "Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation"; and afterwards, "Ye have seen how I bare you on eagle's wings, and brought you unto myself.<a name=404:24></a>" As a type, all was closed for Egyptians and Israel.<a name=404:25></a> The latter were not in glory (Canaan), not in the wilderness, not in Egypt, but brought to God -- not their subjective state, in any respect.<a name=404:26></a> That was experimental; this, judicial and final.<a name=404:27></a> This was returned to at the end, whatever the exercises and "ifs" of the wilderness.<a name=404:28></a> Concerning Jacob and Israel it shall be said as at this time, "What hath God wrought?<a name=404:29></a>" whatever Moses, that is the Spirit of God, might give the conscience of among them.<a name=404:30></a> But from the mountain where they came to meet God, their journey was an experimental state, to humble them, and to prove them, and know what was in their hearts.<a name=404:31></a> And so was the crossing of Jordan, though in another way.<a name=404:32></a> The priests' feet must touch the water, the ark is with them, they with it in the passage.<a name=404:33></a> There was association.<a name=404:34></a> Moses did the work of authority at the Red Sea.<a name=404:35></a> The people stood still and saw the salvation, and when the work was done passed over dryshod.<a name=404:36></a> Death had lost its power in Jordan, but in the ark's going through it with them.<a name=404:37></a> It is Christ's death, but not redemption; it was going in to what was promised, not going out to God.<a name=404:38></a> Hence the stones of death are set up in Canaan; Gilgal comes in.<a name=404:39></a> It is experimental, though of faith.<a name=404:40></a> At any rate we have no dying in Christ, but with Him.<a name=404:41></a> The nearest to it is Colossians 2, where we have the true circumcision in Him, but this is in nowise the same, not even saying how, save by His circumcision, we have the true thing in Him, not the mere Jewish figure.<a name=404:42></a> There is a connection between the Red Sea and Jordan.<a name=404:43></a> Both are Christ's death and resurrection, but one is for us, where we stand still and see; the other, our having part in it, we have died with Him and risen with Him.<a name=404:44></a> The passages (Colossians 2: 12; Ephesians 1 and 2) are entirely misapplied.<a name=404:45></a> There is no dying at all there, but sovereign power comes in, and, when we are dead <i>in sins</i> takes us and puts us into Christ, as it raised up Christ when He <i>was</i> dead, and put Him into glory.<a name=404:46></a> Many other truths connect themselves with these points, as the character of the wilderness, with which the conditional "ifs" of the New Testament connect themselves: and the confounding Ephesians 2 and Colossians 2: 12, with Romans 6, two totally different systems of doctrine, has given rise to wild wanderings of fanaticism; but this would lead me too far.<a name=404:47></a>

		I crave the forbearance of my brethren, my excuse for criticising their explanation being the immense practical importance for souls.<a name=406:1></a> For mark the effect, you have God shut out by the blood on the door posts, and that is all as to Him, and <i>no redemption in the scheme at all</i>; for if the Red Sea be our resurrection with Christ, that clearly is not redemption, that which is designated by "our" as the ones engaged in it.<a name=406:2></a> By redemption I do not mean here the forgiveness of sins by blood, but as used for the operation of God's power in freeing Israel from Egypt.<a name=406:3></a> That involves the blood-shedding and the forgiveness, but went much further.<a name=406:4></a> It was the accomplishment of the statement to Moses (Exodus 6: 6, 7), when the power and title of Pharaoh were destroyed by judgment, as Satan's for us.<a name=406:5></a> So Exodus 3: 8.<a name=406:6></a> So Christ (Galatians 1) gave Himself for our sins, to deliver us from this present evil world.<a name=406:7></a> (1 Peter 1: 18-20; Psalm 106: 10.<a name=406:8></a>) That sin in the flesh was condemned when Christ was a sacrifice for sin, is blessedly true for us, but that was between Him and God; God sending His own Son did it; our coming into it is another thing.<a name=406:9></a> Its being perfectly done there when it was God's work alone, and hence perfect, is our comfort now.<a name=406:10></a> One is God for us, the other -- our death and resurrection is wrought in us, in receiving Christ, that we may be rightly before God.<a name=406:11></a> <br>J.<a name=406:12></a> N.<a name=406:13></a> D.<a name=406:14></a>
