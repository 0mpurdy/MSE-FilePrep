		It has been the profoundest joy to me that the truth giving the scope and true character of Christianity, and the special truths which compose it, learned from Scripture because it was there and was the truth about man, and the truth as to God and His ways, learned for its own sake in grace, has met every part of the system, infidel and erroneous, which has sprung up in these last days.<a name=1:1></a> How it shows, and makes one feel it was divine teaching!<a name=1:2></a> May one be kept simply there.<a name=1:3></a> -- 1878.<a name=1:4></a>

		If I open the Old Testament anywhere -- the Gospels, the Epistles -- what different atmospheres I find myself in at once.<a name=1:5></a> In the old -- ways -- dealings -- government -- man, though man and the world governed by God -- piety no doubt, but piety in that scene; and even in the Gospels and Epistles the difference is quite as great -- in certain respects, more important.<a name=1:6></a> In the Epistles (so the Acts) one active to gather -- souls devoted to Christ, valuing Him and His work above all -- power shown more than in Christ on earth, as He promised -- it is gathering, then caring power.<a name=1:7></a> I get back, though now in the power of the Holy Ghost and grace in a saving, gathering way, to man, and it soon fails.<a name=1:8></a> But in the Gospels I find a Centre where my mind reposes, which is Itself, always Itself, and nothing like It -- moves through a discordant scene, attracting to Itself through grace (what no Apostle did or could do) and shining in Its own perfection, unaltered and unalterable in all circumstances.<a name=1:9></a> It is the thing about which all service is occupied, as its point of departure, and to which all under divine influence is attracted, for it is God.<a name=1:10></a> I was struck with this on the wide Atlantic, my head weary with long storms, on turning to my title -- that blessed Book.<a name=1:11></a>

		It is a blessed thought that Christ will Himself introduce us into the Father's house -- into heaven.<a name=1:12></a> What an entrance will that be, when He leads us in, the fruit of the travail of His own soul -- His own -- and glorified according to His worth -- and all His heavenly company there!<a name=1:13></a> And we await that day.<a name=1:14></a>

		As witnesses of what God is to a sinner, it is evident the Christian should be at peace, and in the consciousness of grace, as well as righteous in his ways, for thus he is, to sinners, an evidence of what God is to sinners, for he was one himself; and he is witness of the efficacy and enjoyment of that grace.<a name=2:1></a>

		As the Pharisees opposed the intrinsic righteousness of Christ, and the Sadducees the doctrine of His resurrection, so the principle of Pharisaism became anew the great source of public trouble in the Church, and sought to add to, and to legalise the truth which it could not deny, so that Christianity should cease to be grace.<a name=2:2></a>

		Had the saints of apostolic times waited for the fulfilment of various events, before the coming of the Lord, they must have waited for the dispersion of the Jews, and a whole series of events, of long duration, connected with that dispersion, as well as their bringing back again.<a name=2:3></a> It would have come in as an historical event, in a series, not as a living expectation; but they were the Church -- not Jews -- and the Lord was precious to them.<a name=2:4></a>

		Promises, precious promises there are for the wilderness way, and indeed the glory at the end, but properly for the way.<a name=2:5></a> But without promises we know God in redemption -- rejoice in what He is, through what He has done, "We joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ through whom we have received the reconciliation".<a name=2:6></a> This is perfect blessedness, not what He has given, but what He is; this was the ground of the Syrophenician woman -- He would have had to deny Himself.<a name=2:7></a> We get not at promises, but at God Himself, and that by what is manifested and wrought in Christ.<a name=2:8></a> Promises are things given to us, but this is the Giver -- this runs all through Christianity in its nature.<a name=2:9></a>

		I think the fact, that we have no Psalms in the New Testament, but a direction to sing them, is very significative of the presence of the Holy Ghost.<a name=3:1></a> The Church sings its own -- has its own joys, and its own relationships.<a name=3:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Note that the angels, not sang, but shouted for joy at the Creation; then at the birth of Jesus, not then man; and in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#5">Revelation  5</a>the saints praise, the angels celebrating the Lamb outside.<a name=3:3></a>

		I have noticed incidentally, but not sufficiently, that the sealing is connected with the Gospel of our <i>salvation</i>; this makes what has perplexed many pretty clear.<a name=3:4></a> It is when the Gospel of simple salvation is received that we are sealed -- so indeed with Cornelius; <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10">Acts  10</a>.<a name=3:5></a>

		I apprehend that practically, the sealing of the Spirit connects itself, in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1">Ephesians  1</a>, with the calling, i.<a name=3:6></a>e.<a name=3:7></a>, stamps us and marks us out, and consciously so, for it; while, as earnest, it is connected with the inheritance.<a name=3:8></a> The anointing would connect itself with verses 17, 18.<a name=3:9></a>

		THE CROSS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is that in which the Cross stands alone.<a name=4:1></a> In Christ's glory I shall participate, and though God is One, and above all, so that there can be no comparison, yet in divine excellency in Person, Christ participates in the divine nature with the Father and the Spirit, and They are one with Him; but in the Cross, though the Father's love is revealed in it, and that He offered Himself through the Eternal Spirit, yet in the suffering proper to the Cross He was alone -- wholly alone.<a name=4:2></a> It is in this sense, morally, more than the glory -- <i>that</i> others can have -- on the Cross what was excellent and glorious, none had share in accomplishing with Christ.<a name=4:3></a> He is the Lamb slain above -- we reap the fruit, but He accomplished this glorious work Himself, and was alone in accomplishing it.<a name=4:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The full bringing out of good and evil on the Cross is very striking.<a name=4:5></a> God (speaking reverently, for the expression is incorrect, it was manifestation, yet to make myself understood), God was fully tested, and He was above sin, and there was absolute righteousness against it, and perfect love.<a name=4:6></a> Man was tested, and he was enmity against God -- that was all his history, unless we add details of evil fruits.<a name=4:7></a> Christ, blessed be His name, was tested, and it was a perfect savour of love and obedience -- there remained nothing to bring out (for faith); all was fully -- good and evil -- perfectly brought into the light; even Satan was there fully manifested, against the manifestation of love in Christ, and as god of this world.<a name=4:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That it was indeed necessary that the death of Christ should intervene, in order that the love of God could satisfy itself in flowing out in unhindered blessing, is easily understood in grace; but what depth of love is in the expression "how am I straitened till it be accomplished!<a name=4:9></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What endless wondrous outgoing of love in all the life and actings of Jesus!<a name=4:10></a> We should think it infinite, for it never failed; but He -- such was the depth, the power, the divine fulness of that which was within that He was straitened -- His love wrought in such power, in such necessity to itself to bless, that to Him, His heart was straitened till all that saving power, in which God was fully revealed and glorified, could go forth to bless.<a name=4:11></a> This tells us clearly what He was.<a name=4:12></a> It is a wondrous expression -- and such was the work upon the Cross; <i>it</i> was sufficient to let flow out all this love -- wondrous work too!<a name=4:13></a>

		POWER IN THE MIDST OF EVIL
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a danger of being disheartened and "vexed" through the prevalence of evil, "Because of the abounding of iniquity, the love of many shall wax cold".<a name=5:1></a> How perfect the blessed Lord was in this!<a name=5:2></a> All was iniquity around Him, yet, in perfect communion with God, His spirit walked in peace, so that He could notice and recognise even all that was naturally lovely -- the lily of the field -- God's care of ravens -- all that was of God here.<a name=5:3></a> But this is because He was perfectly near God (I speak of His mind as Man), but, for the same reason He judges perfectly man and all his thoughts and intents of heart.<a name=5:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But marriage is owned from the beginning -- a child, in which simplicity, confidence and undistrusting readiness of heart to believe, guilelessness as not having learnt the world nor its vanity -- beauty of character, when He looked on the young man, who had displayed that character, He loved him; this is lovely, but the presence of God must try man -- where was his heart?<a name=5:5></a> He went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.<a name=5:6></a> With the best dispositions and readiness to be taught, and plenty to make good use of, the state of the heart is found; "who then can be saved?<a name=5:7></a>" With man it is impossible, but then with God all things are possible.<a name=5:8></a> At the very outset, the Lord had shown him he was all on the wrong tack, seeking goodness in man -- God only was good; the heart was detected -- the Cross alone would do, those who follow Him must take it up -- death to what man was, the only path.<a name=5:9></a> But then there was a blessed starting point for this, "He came to give his life a ransom for many", <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#10">Mark  10</a>.<a name=5:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Cross was first redemption, then the death of the flesh; and we are, for ourselves, to take up the Cross, and, for others, to serve as Christ did.<a name=5:11></a> He had in this character, as now calling souls, only the cup to give -- His baptism and His cup, though there was large, ample reward for those for whom it was prepared.<a name=5:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then comes the reference of this question to the disciples' path.<a name=5:13></a> Where the flesh is not crucified, the world and Satan have power -- they followed trembling, when He steadfastly set His face to go to Jerusalem.<a name=5:14></a> There can be sincerity and blessing -- Christ, the Son, revealed and holding fast by Him, but the flesh not subdued to the measure of that which we really believe, then there is fear and weakness, and it goes

		even to the point of being called Satan by the Lord.<a name=6:1></a> See the difference of Paul by the Holy Ghost -- his righteousness which was a gain to him, was loss to him, he needed it not; had he anything of this world?<a name=6:2></a> It was dung and dross, and followed -- this one thing I do.<a name=6:3></a> If he had forty stripes save one, or despaired of life, he had the sentence of death in himself; he looked to a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory -- a bright example of the power of grace and the Spirit, so as to have an undivided and so undistracted heart, and power with him as in Christ, a perfect example of the good which Paul had to imitate -- a heart perfectly free in its own self; tested indeed, but perfect, and so perfect with God that it could, as above all the evil around it, deeply as it was felt, see and recognise all that was of God.<a name=6:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is wondrously full of instruction to see man's heart sifted, yet all good of God owned; that edge of the divine word, of the word of Christ, which can run its edge through all that to us is so mixed up; nature and fallen nature -- nature from God, and nature from man -- and in perfect goodness in the midst of all, yet tell us plainly of the needed Cross, and the grace of a needed redemption.<a name=6:5></a>

		LEVITICUS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Leviticus, though connected with Sinai, <i>quod nota</i>, in the wilderness of it, is spoken from the Tabernacle -- this is its character.<a name=7:1></a> Then, after the offerings in order, of which sin-offering is special, the covenant and worship was founded on burnt-offering -- sin-offering found to be needed, and then the law, manner of use and order of them; then comes Aaron's consecration, according to <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#28">Exodus  28</a>and 29.<a name=7:2></a> In chapter 9 their hands are filled, but note here no blood is brought into the holy place for sin; though there might be evil to be atoned for, relationship is not yet supposed to be broken.<a name=7:3></a> But all went wrong; first in Nadab and Abihu, and then in not eating the people's sin-offering by the others, and though Moses was content, yet it altered all the order of approach.<a name=7:4></a> Then -- though there had been failure -- from chapters 11 to 15 inclusive, clean and unclean are to be discerned by the anointed, consecrated priests.<a name=7:5></a> Chapter 16 on the fault of Nadab and Abihu, etc.<a name=7:6></a>, the necessity of reconciliation, and that the way into the holiest (Moses, the heavenly man, always went there) was not yet made manifest, was declared, and the manner of entrance there by Aaron prescribed in atonement.<a name=7:7></a> Thereon, i.<a name=7:8></a>e.<a name=7:9></a>, after chapter 16, defiling wickednesses are gone through, connected with the people's relationship with God; this to chapter 20 inclusive.<a name=7:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the holiness of the priests in separatedness to God, and in approach to Him; then of the people's offerings.<a name=7:11></a> Chapter 23 contains the whole course of feasts, chiefly of joy, typical feasts, the history of the Lord's ways, the whole period of dispensation with them -- a long gap, or interval left where the Church comes in.<a name=7:12></a> We have then what belongs to the holy place, save the altar of incense, which in effect was for the most Holy, the passing of the mind out of the holy place, i.<a name=7:13></a>e.<a name=7:14></a>, we have the perfectness of the connection, of Christ's connection with Israel, and of the Spirit's (in this latter we know the Church has a place) -- the double mystic perfection of 12 and 7.<a name=7:15></a> Twelve loaves, Christ's incarnate connection with Israel I believe, and then the sevenfold perfection of the Spirit shining on the candlestick that was of beaten gold (compare also <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#8:1">Numbers  8:1</a> - 4) but here it was before the Lord.<a name=7:16></a> This is the full mystic perfection of Israel; for us the

		<a name=8>[Page 8]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Lord has taken it up into a higher sense.<a name=8:1></a> Then the Word reverts to the terrible legal sanction of all on which it actually stood, noticing any connection with a Gentile, a profane person, and the spurious offspring.<a name=8:2></a> Then, having given the people's mystic place in God's design and purpose, with the sanction of their present standing in it, the Land's portion as God's is mentioned -- the sabbaths and the jubilee, and the portion of the people as the Lord's servants in it; chapter 25: 23 and 55.<a name=8:3></a> In chapter 26 His warnings and threatened dealings with them, as to the Land, first in it -- then in turning them out of it -- and restoration on Abraham's covenant, verse 42; this the Law.<a name=8:4></a> In chapter 27 are voluntary vows; up to chapter 26 are statutes the Lord made between Him and the children of Israel.<a name=8:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Numbers is their history in the wilderness -- written, too, for our admonition, on whom the ends of the world are come -- and what was connected, in God's dealings with that.<a name=8:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		NOTE.<a name=8:7></a> -- The three first chapters of Leviticus go together under the same "the Lord spake unto Moses"; the sin-offerings are another category of offerings.<a name=8:8></a> The meat-offering was most holy, and for the males only among the priests, as the sin- and trespass-offerings.<a name=8:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the offerings it is formally the sons of Aaron to whom the sacrifices were brought, not to Aaron.<a name=8:10></a> I do not call to mind any sacrifices Aaron or the anointed priest offered (save for personal sin) except the great day of atonement, and his consecration -- indeed in public service only the former.<a name=8:11></a> It was Christ's one great sacrifice.<a name=8:12></a> But the estimate of Christ, the handling of Him in the soul can only be by those who are priests, who are Christians.<a name=8:13></a> One only can do the work, and represent us, but we are with God, and in certain cases feed on, and that as priests, according to what Christ has been and has done when here -- in Himself solely offered to God, glorifying Him, as made sin for us, but fed on in His perfectness and death.<a name=8:14></a> The unfolding of this in Leviticus is most precious.<a name=8:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The day of consecration was the day of the acceptance of the whole service by God, but as to the sacrifices, did not go within the veil.<a name=8:16></a> Aaron was in his garments of glory and beauty -- he offers a sin- and burnt-offering, the two essential kinds; the people, every kind.<a name=8:17></a> Sin- and burnt-offerings are that in which Christ is accepted of God for us.<a name=8:18></a> It was the great general public act, and fire came out from God and consecrated and

		<a name=9>[Page 9]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		accepted both.<a name=9:1></a> The people enjoyed all that Christ was in life, and death besides, founded on the sin and burnt-offering.<a name=9:2></a> On the great day of atonement, he had special garments, and the service referred essentially to sin which was there; but to God's very nature within -- the blood was carried within the veil.<a name=9:3></a> Before he offered anything else, he changed his garments, the burnt-offering was subsequent and consequent on the other.<a name=9:4></a> The service of <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#9">Leviticus  9</a>was not consequent on actual sin and defilement.<a name=9:5></a> It gave the full character of Christ's sacrifice and Israel's part in it, or ours as regards responsibility.<a name=9:6></a> The day of atonement was in view of actual sins and defilement, and that in a twofold way -- God's throne and guilt.<a name=9:7></a> The rest was apart.<a name=9:8></a> In this sense it was only a sin-offering and sin-bearing.<a name=9:9></a> In both cases, i.<a name=9:10></a>e.<a name=9:11></a>, chapters 9 and 16, it was in view of men, not intrinsic and its own character with God; hence the sin-offering comes first, as the burnt-offering in chapter 1.<a name=9:12></a> They were for us, but Christ came to put away sin; God's character and majesty and love and righteousness and holiness called for its putting away according to them.<a name=9:13></a> It was necessary that it should be put out of the universe, and Christ stood, who knew no sin, as made sin before God; it was about sin, man's sin, as he stood before God.<a name=9:14></a> This was the great fact which stands alone in eternity's history, and is finished.<a name=9:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So in the meat-offering, the perfect, proved man; then communion, and as a distinct thing, the sin-offering.<a name=9:16></a> But in the burnt-offering, the man brings it; it was on the part of man, sin being there, in view of sin in man, but the priestly estimate of all that it was to God.<a name=9:17></a> It was what it is for faith.<a name=9:18></a> Both that and the meat-offering are complete in themselves (compare <a href="../bible/John.htm#6">John  6</a>, only there we eat) under God's eye, not for actual sins to bear them and clear us.<a name=9:19></a> In the day of atonement this was so, even Godward it was a sin-offering, the goat, and because of iniquities -- compare <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#9">Hebrews  9</a>, "put away sin", "bear the sins of many".<a name=9:20></a> Hence in this estimate of divinely taught faith, it is not the High Priest, but Aaron's sons.<a name=9:21></a> He gives too the reason why these two are the occasions on which Aaron offers.<a name=9:22></a> There remains the special case of Eleazar the priest, with the red heifer, which, though done once, was not in the sanctuary.<a name=9:23></a> In the post-consecration services, there was no going into the sanctuary in connection with the sacrifices, they were at the altar.<a name=9:24></a> Then Moses and Aaron, king and priest, go in and come out.<a name=9:25></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#9">Leviticus  9</a>only refers typically to Israel.<a name=10:1></a> The work does not go within, though effectual to forgive according to the judgment of God; and its efficacy is revealed only when the king and priest come out -- when Israel sees the Lord.<a name=10:2></a> The priest may bless from the sacrifice before manifestation, and so it is, but the worship is when Christ is seen, and the worth of His sacrifice known.<a name=10:3></a> For us, the Holy Ghost is come out while He is within; the fact of going in and coming out, only, is noticed here.<a name=10:4></a> On the day of atonement, the blood is carried within.<a name=10:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a difference in our enjoyment of Christ, our enjoyment of blessings in communion, <i>sha-lom</i> (peace) founded on the blood and fat being offered to God, (and this was eaten by every clean Israelite) and the enjoyment of the perfectness of Christ in Himself, which is for us of course through the blood of the holocaust, and, as a rule, accompanied it -- we read of <i>its</i> meat-offering.<a name=10:6></a> This was in the meat-offering only for priests.<a name=10:7></a> This was offered to God intrinsically in its own perfection, not atoningly for others without; this last, man could not eat, but it was its own perfectness, as suited to God -- all the incense offered to God -- the expression of pure unleavened human nature, presented to God and burned for a sweet savour, but human nature expressing what was divine, but in a man; kneaded with oil, and anointed with oil as a whole, and in all its parts.<a name=10:8></a> Here, while the incense was all burned to God, priests, there consecrated to God, eat of it.<a name=10:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the peace-offerings, there was, whether thanksgiving or voluntary, joy in the effect of Christ's work, and connected with it (if separated, it was not accepted) and fellowship one with another.<a name=10:10></a> In the light as God is, cleansed from all sin by the blood, we have this fellowship.<a name=10:11></a> But in the meat-offering, there was no fellowship with others; it was the enjoyment of Christ Himself, that of which the sweet savour is gone up to God, as a memorial, but of which I eat by grace.<a name=10:12></a> In the peace-offering too, there were leavened cakes.<a name=10:13></a> In the meat-offering it was not to be heard of -- <a href="../bible/John.htm#6">John  6</a>does not, I think, go with this; it is all manwards as in general.<a name=10:14></a> No doubt when so come, He was all this in perfect blessing, but here it is His incarnation and death that we might have life, blessed truth too, but not the offering of what He was in Himself towards God.<a name=10:15></a> Indeed this is only seen in Christ, when actually so in result, <a href="../bible/John.htm#6:62">John  6:62</a>; and our share in it also actually, verses 39,

	<div class="paragraph">
		I apprehend that we have first, as in the first kind of all, the divinely conceived human nature of Christ -- He was conceived of the Holy Ghost; but then He was, at the close of His life, broken to pieces -- every element of His nature was broken up by trial -- desertion of friends on which a heart could lean, and worse than desertion -- giving up what He loved, the Jerusalem He would have gathered -- the compassion He looked for refused by every eye -- denial by one He dearly loved -- exposure to ignominy and shame before a heartless world -- sleep, the refuge of His friends, when He would have one to watch by Him; but where, in every pang, in laying bare every feeling, was the power of the Holy Ghost, spiritual perfectness and power, not shewn?<a name=19:2></a> He was poured out like water, all His bones out of joint, but never was the power and action of the Holy Ghost so shewn -- every part was anointed -- and this breaking up was only the occasion of shewing it.<a name=19:3></a>

		In the three first Gospels, in general, we have more of the breaking in pieces -- in John, of power, though not exclusively, for in Luke we find the power too.<a name=19:4></a> In Luke, He states to the thief, he shall be with Him in Paradise -- in Luke, He commends His Spirit to the Father; yet in Gethsemane, in John, we have only the manifestation of the anointing.<a name=19:5></a> This I cannot here pursue further, but waiting on Scripture for it, it is full of interest -- was not the suffering of His obedience, the display, or occasion of the display, of His spiritual power, and in a much more intimate manner?<a name=19:6></a> His life, though both were necessarily and always true, gave the whole cake -- the outward, and, in this sense, superficial or outwardly manifested power of the Holy Ghost; but the breaking up every element of His nature in death -- and it was absolute -- shewed every inward part, all His moral nature, as the complete exhibition of the power of the Holy Ghost in inward perfectness.<a name=19:7></a> Hence, more than miracles -- a creature imperfect at other times can work them; but who could have been what Christ was, when the fountains of the great deep were broken up over His soul?<a name=19:8></a> I can here only imperfectly suggest it.<a name=19:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The atonement is laid as the great central ground of all God's ways in righteousness.<a name=68:1></a> God is perfect love to us there -- He is Love; but then, where no hiding, excusing or patience with sin because of weakness was in question, where One who could bear it was, was made sin, all God was, in His necessary antagonism, horror of, judgment against sin, went out against sin, as such, in Him who was able to bear it.<a name=68:2></a> God being glorified, purpose, government, as death or chastening His children, can all come out and have their place.<a name=68:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The worth of that, according to which righteousness is obtained, is such that the purpose of God righteously unites us to Christ, and gives a place where He is in glory like and with Him -- we are children, holy and without blame before Him in love.<a name=68:4></a> He gives to the Jews a place on earth, and deals with them for the display of His government down here; so with us as His children -- God deals with us in chastisement and discipline, but all this supposes righteousness and non-imputation.<a name=68:5></a> There could be no government without this -- God's forbearance before the Cross was justified by this.<a name=68:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is evident there are two kinds of righteousness -- justice as against evil, and adequate appreciation and even recompense of good.<a name=68:7></a> "Vengeance is mine, I will recompense saith the Lord" is a different thing from "The righteous Lord loveth righteousness, his countenance beholds the upright"; though both are abstractedly the just estimate of good and evil.<a name=68:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards the former, and the controversy we have had, when God has the character of a Judge, my adversaries are all wrong, because God's righteousness as Judge is in Scripture connected with blood, as in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3">Romans  3</a>; so in the Passover.<a name=68:9></a> But as to the principle, no man could ever plead a part in the second dealing of righteousness save Christ Himself, for "all are sinners"; Christ, even as a Man down here, could be accepted as perfectly agreeable to God.<a name=68:10></a> But then Christianity, and even Judaism in its figures, goes a great deal further -- for grace reigns through righteousness, and sinners were to be justified or accounted righteous.<a name=68:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To be justice, in the common sense of the word, it must be the just estimate of conduct itself, or adequate satisfaction for the fault -- thus, a man serves me in a thing, renders due service, I am just in recognising this, I own him in the place

		wherein he stands; if he owes me money and another pays it, or has done a wrong and another repairs it, he is also clear.<a name=69:1></a> In the case of material service, another's doing a man's duty may suffice, though, if the service be owed by the man, I am not bound to accept it; still, in material service, if the service only be due, and the man not in responsible relationship to me, I may be justly satisfied.<a name=69:2></a> But in relationships and moral right and wrong, this is not so, I cannot accept another's doing what my son owes me and be satisfied with my son; righteousness here requires the duty to be fulfilled, or is not satisfied.<a name=69:3></a> To be atoned for and put away as guilt can be rightly, because the guilt is owned, but not a doing the work or duty so that there should be no guilt.<a name=69:4></a> The latter weakens the personal obligation, sets it aside, the former owns and atones for it.<a name=69:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in Christianity there is more, for God is to be displayed, grace reign, and man to be brought to God Himself.<a name=69:6></a> Hence the measure is God's glory and in itself unveiled, not man's duty -- of this anon.<a name=69:7></a> But any attempt to meet responsibility in relationship by another's fulfilling the claims, tends to destroy the sense of guilt in it, and is morally heinous -- if another has done my duty, and it is as if I have done it, or better, the claim satisfied, then I have done it as to justice and I am not guilty.<a name=69:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If it does not meet the case thus, the idea turns what is due into a material debt and destroys the moral nature of failure -- becomes doing, not conduct.<a name=69:9></a> I ask if another's doing my child's duty would in any way affect the relationship of my child to me?<a name=69:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This I see in the figures -- reconciliation must have an altar and blood-shedding; wrongs may be repaired toward man or toward God, and so it was ordained under the law, but in questions of obedience and relationship not so.<a name=69:11></a> There is guilt, and atonement must come in; omission or commission is all one here.<a name=69:12></a> Do I fail in worship to God -- can another worship for me?<a name=69:13></a> Now all our questions with God are questions of obedience and relationship.<a name=69:14></a> But then according to principles I have noticed before, though all be done according to the glory of God, for indeed it is one act -- the death of Christ -- yet the application of the work to man is different; the brazen altar met man's sin coming as such -- the mercy-seat was introduction into the presence of God.<a name=69:15></a> It was a golden throne; it was judgment against sin, and righteousness to enter into

		<a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#16">Leviticus  16</a>is thus quite apart on another ground from the consecration of Aaron which was properly Jewish.<a name=75:3></a> Chapter 8 gives this regularly in consecrating Aaron in connection with them, in which there was no entering in within the veil, though the bodies of the sin-offering were burned without the camp; and then, in the application, there is the same as to Aaron, but then Aaron should, as to application to Israel in respect of God's dealings, have eaten the goat of the sin-offering which indeed he had not done.<a name=75:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But I question whether chapter 16 did not put Israel in connection with the most holy place in blessing from thence through a priest who had entered in there, though the veil subsisted and none but Aaron went in; and this in connection with judgment for sin -- Nadab and Abihu, i.<a name=75:5></a>e.<a name=75:6></a>, the failure of blessing on any other ground in any case.<a name=75:7></a> Hence, even on the inauguration day, Moses and Aaron go in and come out -- King and Priest -- and bless the people, and the glory appears, and then the fire consumes the sacrifice as from within, i.<a name=75:8></a>e.<a name=75:9></a>, its acceptation by God as within, in respect of judgment, is publicly known to the people.<a name=75:10></a> This is, I apprehend, the position and doctrine of the Hebrews, only adding the heavenly calling, and abiding peace, and going within, i.<a name=75:11></a>e.<a name=75:12></a>, the contrast of our present place, as we have already seen, but then reserving Israel's place in the last days.<a name=75:13></a>

		It is evident that a priest, so minded, would have had profound joy in the thought that in virtue of Christ, the grace of God by a sacrifice of perfect reconciliation and expiation, the Israelite who had failed was placed in perfect acceptance with God.<a name=75:14></a> The eating of the sacrifice was thus in spirit the sense that one, beloved of God, was brought back morally and according to God's glory, to His favour through the perfect work of Christ.<a name=75:15></a>

		THE OLD TESTAMENT
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The fullest moral teaching of the Old Testament has a peculiar character natural to the character of the then relationship to God, but in that goes most pure and deep, indeed I think has it more fully and deeply than the New -- it is that of responsibility, but going to entire integrity and purity of heart.<a name=87:1></a> In the New Testament we get far more grace and fruits of love, no doubt the other is supposed or laid as a subjective ground, and out of which divine fruit is to grow, as Christ who was in nature and person holy -- was the winning display of love and grace among men; the Holy One came down, He was holy, He lived in grace (of course not ceasing to be holy, I need not say) so holy that He could be in love without stint in the midst of all, and thus go down to the vilest.<a name=87:2></a> But the Old Testament looking from Adam upward was to enquire how man could draw near, not the display of God to man in man; I think in the Sermon on the Mount, with the exception of merciful which God showed Himself -- and the opposite is hard selfishness and cruelty -- it will be found that Old Testament principles in this are pursued to their full inward power, only, I think, with more calmness as became Christ, not so much in requirement and exercise of heart, as in the Psalms, as a model and perfect expression of what it is in its blessedness.<a name=87:3></a> The government of God with the Christian applies itself fully to this subjective state, and it is (as it was perfectly so in Christ) that subjective condition in which, as in unhindered communion with God, the other flows forth from Him whom I know in love; see, for example, <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3:12">Colossians  3:12</a> - 14.<a name=87:4></a> This is the natural consequence of the distinction of position -- the Old Testament was the new life of a sinner with whom the question was "How shall I come to God?<a name=87:5></a>"; the Christian is come to God, and is of God then in the world.<a name=87:6></a>

		The main points are noticed in the Synopsis, but I note the whole here as important.<a name=123:1></a> The worship is characterised by the open declaration, and founded in its nature and character of the present possession of and standing in the blessing which grace and redemption had brought the people into, and this it is I note as important.<a name=123:2></a> They are in the land, as we "in Christ" in heavenly places, "blessed with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ", and we come with the joy, thanksgiving and praise, the worship that is, the first-fruits of that.<a name=123:3></a> It is the rising up by the Spirit of the return and effect of being in and enjoying the fulness of God's blessing.<a name=123:4></a> Then it is in the place where God is fully revealed, and where He dwells -- the place in which He has put His name, which He has chosen to this end.<a name=123:5></a> He gathers the people, and so the soul with its first-fruits -- the first-fruits of its privileged blessings -- into the place which He has chosen to dwell in, and where He fully reveals Himself; we know where and the way.<a name=123:6></a> For us it is the Father's house, "My Father and your Father, my God and your God".<a name=123:7></a> Then not as without, hoping to get it, but as within, in the enjoyment of all spiritual blessings, as that in which we are, we offer our first-fruits to God.<a name=123:8></a> What we were surely comes in and greatly enhances the blessing, as redemption necessarily does, and such a redemption!<a name=123:9></a> But it enhances it, not alters or diminishes it, "A Syrian ready to perish was" -- not "is".<a name=123:10></a> The first principle is the present full enjoyment of the blessing itself, and that is sufficient -- characterises it -- only we do remember how grace has given us such a place.<a name=123:11></a>

		Though we start from death and resurrection, I do not think that Colossians takes us out of the wilderness; it is not however Hebrews truth, but a condition between.<a name=128:12></a> It takes up the Red Sea, but not for the wilderness, but in view of Canaan.<a name=128:13></a> The wilderness was no purpose of God (see <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#3:8">Exodus  3:8</a> and chapter 15) but His ways.<a name=128:14></a> In Colossians the hope is laid up for us in heaven.<a name=128:15></a> When we are said to be risen, it is only the administration of Christ's resurrection in baptism (not so in Ephesians); it is "we are buried with him in baptism, wherein also we are risen with Him through faith of

		What is more remarkable is that, while Romans and Colossians have also Christ in us according to <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>, in Ephesians this is not found, save in the wish that He may dwell in our hearts by faith, which is quite another thing, and could not be applied to His being in us.<a name=129:9></a> It is clear Colossians is only a state on earth, but dead and risen with Christ and looking up to heaven.<a name=129:10></a> As heretofore remarked, we have not the Holy Ghost here, but life.<a name=129:11></a> The Colossians, too, is exclusively to Gentiles, not the union of both Jew and Gentile in one body, though the Church and Body be specifically named.<a name=129:12></a> Hence also state and condition, not relationship, is fully developed; not relationship either to the Father or to Christ.<a name=129:13></a> It is not the plan or counsel of God, but the state of the Colossians.<a name=129:14></a> Hence in Ephesians we have no "if"; in Colossians we have "if" in the first chapter -- as they were on earth, the question remained.<a name=129:15></a> But it is not through the wilderness, but holding fast the hope, for the position is in chapter 1: 27; so verse 5, the condition is in verses 10 - 14.<a name=129:16></a> So <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:4">Ephesians  1:4</a> is counsel; <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:22">Colossians  1:22</a> is what is to be.<a name=129:17></a> So the result in Ephesians is the showing forth the exceeding riches of God's grace; in Colossians we have "a hope laid up in heaven".<a name=129:18></a> "Resurrection" in the Colossians is after burial to death (we had lived in sin); in Ephesians, it is when we were dead in sins.<a name=129:19></a> After this in Colossians we have no resurrection.<a name=129:20></a> "Quickening" makes the essential difference, resurrection and heavenly places in Christ the place.<a name=129:21></a> Had He taken man living on the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But Colossians goes farther than Peter; in Peter, Christ having suffered, we arm ourselves with the same mind, have faith in the Red Sea work, and so arm ourselves with the same mind, begotten again to a lively hope through His resurrection.<a name=130:7></a> That we have in Colossians but we have more; we were dead in sins and the uncircumcision of the flesh, and are quickened with Christ.<a name=130:8></a> But that goes no further here.<a name=130:9></a> It is life, Christ as our own life in the wilderness, and our hope and affections in heaven; dead with Him in baptism gives occasion to resurrection, not quickening when we were dead, i.<a name=130:10></a>e.<a name=130:11></a>, chapters 2: 20 and 3: 1, refer to chapter 2: 12, not to verse 13.<a name=130:12></a> It is life, and life in the power of Christ's resurrection to whose death we have been baptised, and by faith in the operation of God, are therein risen, so that our profession here is resurrection and risen life -- we are not alive in the world, i.<a name=130:13></a>e.<a name=130:14></a>, Egypt, Christ is our life but it is hidden; we are on earth.<a name=130:15></a> Hence it is Christ's appearing that is brought forward -- the hidden life manifested, and here.<a name=130:16></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards figures, Ephesians, though it recognise the fact of sins and redemption, yet in its teaching sets us wholly in Canaan, as once dead and a new creation, and Christ Himself as so risen from the dead.<a name=131:4></a> All is in heaven.<a name=131:5></a> We have no wilderness, or man proved here.<a name=131:6></a> Man is looked at as non-existent morally for God, and no feeling there, and none to be awaked.<a name=131:7></a> The Red Sea as redemption and Jordan coalesce -- indeed the Red Sea comes in by the bye, that is, though redemption through blood be fully recognised (chapter 1: 7), yet our sitting in heavenly places is the beginning of our history along with Christ.<a name=131:8></a> It is our state, and we begin from over Jordan, i.<a name=131:9></a>e.<a name=131:10></a>, as out of it; or Israel is looked at as in a lost dead state in Egypt, and, as I have said, the Red Sea and Jordan coalesce, and we, as far as the type corresponds, are out of Jordan or death.<a name=131:11></a> Redemption is just noticed, but the purposes of God are before us, and that is in Canaan and with Christ or in Him now -- the Red Sea and Jordan -- Christ's death and resurrection, and especially Jordan (ours with Him), supposes we have to die, and of this there is nothing in Ephesians, being in heavenly places.<a name=131:12></a> In Colossians this is hope, and death to sin through Christ's death is brought in.<a name=131:13></a> Man lived in sin.<a name=131:14></a> A new creation is no part properly of the types; we may see where it comes in, but it stands by itself.<a name=131:15></a> Hence the calling in Ephesians is before the redemption, the inheritance after.<a name=131:16></a> Redemption supposes a people, object of God's favour, to redeem, though in Ephesians only forgiveness is spoken of.<a name=131:17></a> In one we are associated with Christ before God according to His nature, chapter 1: 3 - 6 (redemption); but having put us there, we are trusted with the knowledge of Christ's glory in purpose, and so made heirs with Him.<a name=131:18></a>

		The baptism was the baptism of repentance; now for the remission of sins to those that presented, Paul has a new commission.<a name=151:3></a> He is not dealing in the midst of a known people who have promises, calling souls out of it to repentance, and they should receive remission, separated from the untoward generation.<a name=151:4></a> He takes up man as man (owning the Jews) and brings him into God's presence in light.<a name=151:5></a> He was delivered from men wholly, from the people and from the Gentiles to whom he was sent, but belonged to neither but to a glorified Christ, to open men's eyes, and to turn men from darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive remission of their sins, and an inheritance among them that are "sanctified by faith that is in me".<a name=151:6></a> He is not sent to baptise at all, and though he called men everywhere to repent and turn to God, for this is the essence of his work everywhere, yet it is not presented in his mission under the form of repentance -- self-judgment in respect of a place we are already in, and inconsistencies with it, and advantages offered as the Law and Christ presented to Israel -- but a change and deliverance from human blindness and Satan's power, to light and God for the remission of their sins and an inheritance by faith in Christ.<a name=151:7></a> This made him, first in Damascus, then in Judea, then to the Gentiles, call men to repent and turn to God.<a name=151:8></a> But for the Gentiles it was, even in testimony, a wholly new state, and baptism forms no part of it, no more than the mission in John; and he tells us himself, he was not sent to baptise.<a name=151:9></a> It went on; but practice, not commandment, is what we have in Scripture.<a name=151:10></a>

		The connection of the Levitical service with priesthood leads, I think, to some blessed instruction; because priesthood, in its full sense, is the connection of man with all that is revealed of God in redemption.<a name=158:1></a> Only there is another element to be taken into consideration now -- the Father revealed in the Son.<a name=158:2></a> The Levites were first wholly given to God, according to the efficacy and cleansing power of Christ's sacrifice.<a name=158:3></a> Then, for their service, they were given to Aaron, and accomplished their appointed tasks.<a name=158:4></a> Now, it is only under the hand, and at the disposition of the priest they can act, though their service be appointed; so we, the priesthood is for man, but to God, and is based on all that in which Christ, in connection with man's lost estate, has glorified God, and in which all that God is in love, grace, righteousness, majesty, truth, and holiness is glorified, and that in bringing man to Him in knowledge of all He is, and formed into blessing for God's glory according to it, of which Christ is the fulness -- the veil now rent, and the way into the holiest open -- we entering in there -- He appearing in the presence of God for us.<a name=158:5></a>

		PROMISE AND GRACE

		There are three things in Scripture which go before God's work and grace in Christ, and to which His coming applies.<a name=160:1></a> First, conscience -- man fell in sin into the knowledge of good and evil; next came full and absolute promise before law -- law put the promise on condition, and brought in the curse; then Christ purged the conscience, giving God's own holiness as the proper measure of it -- accomplished and put us in possession of the promise, and took the curse of the law, working out a better righteousness.<a name=160:2></a> Yet He has not simply met them, for he has raised conscience to the height, not of what fitted man as a creature, but to the height of God's holiness by the blessed revelation of it.<a name=160:3></a> He has given the promise in His Person, and added union with Himself, which, while it accomplished, was beyond all promise -- this is the great truth of the Church -- and has brought in a far better righteousness, God's righteousness.<a name=160:4></a> And the great difference is this -- the former things were in relationship with men, and though the promise was God's, and as sure as His Word could be, yet it was in connection with, and could have and will have its accomplishment in men (through Christ) on the earth; but the fulfilment was in the revelation of God accomplishing His own thoughts, and revealing His own nature.<a name=160:5></a> It had its character and fulness necessarily in connection with and measured by Himself and His thoughts.<a name=160:6></a>

		THE HUMILIATION OF CHRIST
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The humiliation of Christ opens out to my mind in a very full and blessed character.<a name=166:1></a> The essential being of Godhead cannot change, as is evident -- the Absolute, as men speak -- and whatever His humiliation, all the fulness of the Godhead (<i>theotetos</i>) dwelt in Him bodily.<a name=166:2></a> His emptying Himself (<i>ekenose</i>) applied to the <i>morphe</i> (form).<a name=166:3></a> He was in the <i>status</i>, condition of Godhead, of which, not to speak of outward glory, will and acting from His own will (though one with the Father, see <a href="../bible/John.htm#5">John  5</a>) was proper and essential.<a name=166:4></a> But the full purpose of His will in free devotedness, and always so, was to give up His own will, and this according to eternal counsels; <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#40">Psalm  40</a>.<a name=166:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was not a lowly being, to whom it is evil to have a will of its own, who had none -- that would have been nothing; nothingness was the place of nothingness.<a name=166:6></a> But He who in His essence could will, gives up His place, or condition as such, and says "Lo, I come to do thy will".<a name=166:7></a> It was a divine act, always so, but a divine act of <i>kenosis</i> (making empty).<a name=166:8></a> He was thus relative to the Father, not only as Son but as Servant -- an immense truth!<a name=166:9></a> He gave up, not Godhead -- that could not be -- but the <i>status</i> and position of it, and came not to do His own will, but the will of Him that sent Him.<a name=166:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Man answered to this place according to the counsels and glory of God, as the angels, the obedient administrators of power, witnesses of a sustained creation, but he who had been made in God's image, and now fallen, was in the condition to be the sphere of the display of all God's moral glory, mercy, grace, righteousness, above all, love, for God is Love; in a word -- redemption.<a name=166:11></a> Christ was a Man.<a name=166:12></a> And now, in the same perfectness, He takes no will, not even of man, not even to eat when He was hungry -- He lives by every word out of the mouth of God.<a name=166:13></a> He humbles Himself and is obedient even unto death, and that of the Cross -- no resistance -- no escape, though legions of angels would be ready at His call.<a name=166:14></a> He perseveres in submitting to all -- a tested obedience, even to death.<a name=166:15></a> Not merely obedience in peace, as Adam innocent might, or an Angel (though doubtless they must feel the ruin) but tested by unvarying giving up of self and where evil was.<a name=166:16></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in His own personal place, in which He is in connection with us, or rather we with Him, He never gives up the serving place -- He takes it now; <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>.<a name=167:6></a> In <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#12">Luke  12</a>, He takes it in glory, but in the heavenly blessedness connected with us -- those His Father has given Him.<a name=167:7></a> And finally, when the reigning and subjecting process is complete, and He gives up the kingdom whose power was needed for that, He takes the simple subject place as Man in the eternal blessedness of God -- still "God over all, blessed for ever more", One with the Father -- but His place as the subject Man perfect, and we with Him.<a name=167:8></a> Wondrous thought!<a name=167:9></a> The Firstborn among many brethren, <i>metochoi</i> (companions), not, note, <i>koinonoi</i> (common equal sharers) we could not be that, compare <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:14">Hebrews  2:14</a>, consequent on verse 11.<a name=167:10></a>

		God -- and no mediatorial kingdom and power -- being all in all -- His <i>kenosis</i> (emptying) is no more undone than His Godhead.<a name=167:11></a> He always was and is Son with the Father -- was and is always God; and now is and ever will be Man <i>kenosas heauton</i> (who emptied Himself), it was, and so ever is, His own divine act; only He has a temporary kingdom according to eternal counsels in this character, a kingdom which He gives up.<a name=167:12></a> The apostle John enters largely into this; his Gospel is the expression of it, but it comes out elsewhere in connection with the names of God, Light and Love, both of them essential names of God, yet with some difference, for Light has something of quality in it belonging to a person -- Love is more absolutely personal.<a name=167:13></a> God is purity and manifests all things.<a name=167:14></a> But we are light in the Lord; as partakers of the divine nature, we partake of this quality.<a name=167:15></a> In <a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#1:4">2 Peter  1:4</a>, we are <i>theias kotnonoi phuseos</i> (partakers of divine nature), not <i>tes</i> (of the), and it is by promise our own state.<a name=167:16></a> But we are not love, for Love is sovereign

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in Christ's <i>kenosis</i> (emptying) of Himself, and the course of His humiliation unto death, we find this love exercised -- it is divine love expressed -- we have seen the Father in Him -- love brought to need -- love active; "Hereby know we love, because He laid down his life for us".<a name=168:2></a> So that the revelation of God, that in which His Being acts, according to what He is, was in this way <i>kenosis</i> and self humbling of Christ; only we add "He gave his only-begotten Son", when we speak of it historically in its external action.<a name=168:3></a> And Christ, thus the expression of Love, i.<a name=168:4></a>e.<a name=168:5></a>, of God, in the world, God manifest in the flesh, was also necessarily Light in the world -- purity, and showing what all was, but showing sovereign goodness to it when thus manifested.<a name=168:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Formally, grace and truth came by Jesus Christ -- He was the love of God in the world, and light in it.<a name=168:7></a> The darkness comprehended it not.<a name=168:8></a> But it was in Man, and it became thus impartitive, the Word of life, "He that hath the Son hath life", they that received Him being born of God; and being cleansed, the Holy Ghost could dwell in them in order to power of realisation.<a name=168:9></a> Thus the Apostle prays that they "may be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man, that Christ might dwell in their hearts by faith", not merely be life and righteousness, but dwell there in the power of the realisation of faith -- He who is the expression and revelation of love -- that we may be rooted and grounded in it.<a name=168:10></a> We dwell in love and in God, or rather here He in us, and thus are at the centre of the display of glory; the more external thing, and so far finite that it is in that which is created, but the display of God's glory in it, though not without love as its source and sustaining, for it is in redemption.<a name=168:11></a> Christ thus takes in all -- first descended then ascended that He might fill all things -- but then the Saints, and this is their wondrous place, are associated with Him personally here, and we "comprehend with all saints"; for they are indeed His <i>metochoi</i>, loved as He is loved, however personally infinitely above them.<a name=168:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ has taken this place in the same divine, perfect love, self being gone, that He might put us in the same place with Himself -- whom the Father had given Him -- and even now, His peace, His joy, the Father's words, the Father's love, and

		the glory given to them -- gone to His Father and our Father, His God and our God -- to be with Him where He is; for in emptying Himself and becoming a Man, it was to associate us, the joint heirs in the same place, though ever Firstborn.<a name=169:1></a> Hence the Apostle adds "and to know the love of Christ" -- not abstract here, "rooted and grounded in love", through His dwelling in our hearts, who is the divine fulness of this love -- Himself; but now He has entered into the counsels of actual glory, length, depth, etc.<a name=169:2></a> -- it is the love of Christ, the actual manifested, exercised love, yet still divine, "it passes knowledge", that we may be thus filled into all the fulness of God Himself, which indeed dwelt in Him bodily; compare <a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:20">1 John  5:20</a>.<a name=169:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Colossians does not enter on this ground, only touching it in "Christ in you, the hope of Glory".<a name=169:4></a> It is blessed to see how the highest being of God is exercised in grace towards any poor sinner.<a name=169:5></a> It is there it is, though afterwards perfected in us, see <a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:12">1 John  4:12</a>, 13.<a name=169:6></a> This has partly led us in this enquiry into the counter part, that "as he is, so are we", because it is thus we enter into and understand it; "we are in him that is true, i.<a name=169:7></a>e.<a name=169:8></a>, in his Son -- he is the true God and eternal life".<a name=169:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the gospel of John gives us large communications on this humiliation of Christ.<a name=169:10></a> His Godhead shines in every page of all the gospels, but John, as every one knows, in a peculiar way gives us the Person of Christ -- the Word made flesh.<a name=169:11></a> Now I have remarked elsewhere the fact of the way in which He is everywhere One with the Father, yet receives all.<a name=169:12></a> But it is the direct expression of the truth we are studying -- He is God, He is one with the Father, He is I Am.<a name=169:13></a> Everywhere He speaks to His Father on a divine footing of unity; "I have glorified thee, now glorify me".<a name=169:14></a> But He has taken the form of a Servant, never "now I will glorify Myself".<a name=169:15></a> "My Father is greater than I"; "The glory thou hast given me" -- yet it was a glory He had -- "with the Father before the world was", "Thou hast given him power over all flesh" -- "I receive whoever comes, for I came not to do my own will, but the will of him that sent me".<a name=169:16></a> He finishes the work the Father gave Him to do -- it is the Father that sent Him; so chapter 8: 26.<a name=169:17></a> But it is in this chapter the Lord says: "Before Abraham was, I am", which the Jews well understood.<a name=169:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus it becomes the clearest exposition of this unspeakable truth, the result of that, when in the form of God <i>ekenose heauton</i> -- His own act -- divine all through, at every moment.<a name=170:12></a> How true it remains "No man knows the Son but the Father"; but we adore Him.<a name=170:13></a> He is not ashamed to call us brethren, for now we are <i>ez enos</i> (of one).<a name=170:14></a>

		But the point my mind rests on is, the <i>kenosis</i> of Himself; the rest is consequence, however blessed; <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#45:6">Psalm  45:6</a>, 7; <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:8">Hebrews  1:8</a>, 9.<a name=170:15></a> Christ <i>ekenose heauton</i>, and took upon Him the form of a Servant.<a name=170:16></a> Our best delight will be to be hidden behind Him and see Him have all the glory.<a name=170:17></a> It is interesting to see that whatever depth the Person of the Lord may give to this, the blessing itself, which has its very character from its adaptation to our state, is enjoyed by the simplest faith, and the more simple the more it is enjoyed.<a name=170:18></a> Christ dwelling in our hearts by faith is enjoyed by him in whom He dwells, not by him who can explain it, though it be true it must be enjoyed in order to be able to explain it.<a name=170:19></a>

		It is to be noticed that though Jehovah was known, the name did not in general enter into the habits of popular thought till it was a national God, and then it did, and this is a proof of the antiquity of the Pentateuch.<a name=203:3></a> The names are not compounded with <i>Elohim</i>, but with <i>El</i>.<a name=203:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Further, there is no evidence in Chronicles of any names compounded with the name of <i>Jehovah</i> or <i>Jah</i> before that name was taken in covenant by God.<a name=203:5></a> The earliest is that of "the sons of Ethan; Azariah", verse 8.<a name=203:6></a> In what generation he was is not shown; Ethan was in the same generation with Achan's grandfather, and Achan was in Canaan, so that Azariah was quite probably after the Exodus.<a name=203:7></a> The notion that genealogies give all the steps is notoriously unfounded, and in Chronicles it is merely the gathering up of memorials.<a name=203:8></a> In this case it is more than probable he does not say "the son of Ethan" but "the sons" -- Azariah was the only one who represented the family.<a name=203:9></a>

		There is no proof that Caleb was the son of Hezron, son of Pharez; if it was the same Caleb as in Numbers, he was the son of Jephunneh.<a name=203:10></a> One thing is certain, the Hezron in question died in Canaan in Caleb Ephratah, and it was after this that Abiah bore a son.<a name=203:11></a> Hence we see there were no early names in Chronicles with "<i>jah</i>"; Abijah was the grandson of one who died in Canaan.<a name=203:12></a> In general the names are after the Exodus.<a name=203:13></a> Carmi and Hur are given as sons of Judah because they were directly descended from him, for they were clearly not his sons, nor was Shobal; verse 50 shows that Shobal was at least great-grandson of Judah's grandson, and Reaiah was his son, i.<a name=203:14></a>e.<a name=203:15></a>, there were at least six generations.<a name=203:16></a>

		Further we have the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost which He shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour, that being justified by His grace we should be heirs according to the hope of eternal life.<a name=228:8></a> The renewing (<i>anakainosis</i>) of the Holy Ghost is not merely "regeneration" or a new life; it is objective bringing into the sphere we are introduced into by Christ and redemption, the <i>kainos</i> state of things -- new creation (<i>kaino ktisis</i>), the <i>neos</i> regeneration is more subjective, essential but subjective and in application does not, that I see, go beyond earthly things, but earthly things with God -- the desert now (not Canaan) and the desert to blossom as a rose but not Canaan.<a name=228:9></a> So in <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:22">1 Peter  1:22</a>, 23, it is subjection "you have purified your souls in obeying the truth, being born .<a name=228:10></a>.<a name=228:11></a>.<a name=228:12></a> of the Word".<a name=228:13></a> No doubt heaven is here full in hope, but the regeneration, the being born is subjective condition.<a name=228:14></a> The strongest point of connection, for that is what it is, is in <a href="../bible/James.htm#1:18">James  1:18</a>, but it does not in fact reach out of the sphere down here, though the sort of nature for that according to the purpose of God.<a name=228:15></a> Peter is "hath begotten again" (<i>anagennesas</i>).<a name=228:16></a> In <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#19:28">Matthew  19:28</a>, the regeneration (<i>paliggenesia</i>) is clearly earthly and a state of things.<a name=228:17></a> So that what I get in regeneration is a subjective state "born of God", "of the Spirit", "of water", "of the Word", and as a sphere merely, so far as earth, only the foundation of relationship with God.<a name=228:18></a>

		The whole sphere of relationship is changed and the hope of eternal life comes in.<a name=229:1></a> So in Colossians and Ephesians, the <i>palaios anthropos</i> (old man) is put off.<a name=229:2></a> This is general, the former man now grown old and rejected, but then we have distinctly the <i>neon</i> and the <i>kainon</i>; here <i>neon</i> is in connection with regeneration and subjective, and <i>kainon</i> new in nature and character, and, brought into a new sphere, its relationships are in question -- <i>neos</i> begins, <i>kainos</i> is different, and so lives in a new sphere.<a name=229:3></a> Thus, Colossians, we have put on the new -- it is a new man now beginning, but it is <i>anakainoumenon</i> into knowledge according to the image of Him that created it.<a name=229:4></a> This is the renewing of the Holy Ghost shed on us, <i>anakainosis</i>.<a name=229:5></a> The nature is proper -- capable -- but it is in a wholly new scene and there developed in power.<a name=229:6></a> So <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4">Ephesians  4</a>we are <i>ananeousthai</i> in the spirit of our minds.<a name=229:7></a> This is subjective again, in contrast with the corrupt old man -- what it is -- and we have put on the <i>kainon anthropon</i>, one new in character, different, created according to God in righteousness and holiness -- neither corrupt nor innocent, but according to the character of God Himself.<a name=229:8></a> The sphere is not entered into; he had largely done this, and his object here is character, still it is objective (<i>kata</i>).<a name=229:9></a> The washing of regeneration cleanses subjectively, and what is born of the Spirit is spirit -- has Its essential nature and characteristics -- but the renewing of the Holy Ghost leads us into the whole sphere of that new state of things into which Christ is entered as risen and now gone up on high.<a name=229:10></a> And though we must be born to have life, and have life if born, yet eternal life is only known in redemption, and the scene and state into which redemption brings.<a name=229:11></a> Hence though we have put on the new man (<i>kainon</i>) in putting on the risen Christ, yet there is an <i>anakainosis</i> through the Holy Ghost in bringing us into the apprehension of the new creation (<i>kaine ktisis</i>) where all things are new (<i>kaina</i>).<a name=229:12></a>

		But there is another point, I think, which comes out from the end of John's gospel.<a name=230:7></a> I have said for us it must be by death and resurrection, but in itself it is in Christ, and this leads to another and more intimate apprehension of what it is, though always on this ground.<a name=230:8></a>

		It appears that not only "Kingdom of Heaven", but so far as I find "Kingdom of my Father", or "their Father's Kingdom" is peculiar to Matthew; and it would seem to meet the notion of the Jews expecting Messiah, King upon earth.<a name=246:1></a> They would not be subjects of Messiah's kingdom upon earth, but they would have something much better -- they were to be sons, and Jesus ascended (refusing to be touched or worshipped by them as King upon earth then in resurrection, in which character He would reign over the Jews and world) to His Father and their Father, His God and their God.<a name=246:2></a> Declared, however, Son of God with power according to the Spirit of holiness by the resurrection from the dead, they then were not to be reigned over by the Son Messiah, but were to be sons, "Behold what manner of love", etc.<a name=246:3></a>, therefore in the kingdom of their Father, Jesus appointing a kingdom to them, as the Father to Him, they sitting in His throne as He is in His Father's now.<a name=246:4></a> In this then, as a Son, He is with the Father and we with Him as sons in His, i.<a name=246:5></a>e.<a name=246:6></a>, the Father's, kingdom.<a name=246:7></a> To the Son shall be given the positive kingdom over all under the whole heaven -- we being with Him in the Father's sitting there -- He as Son with us, for it is the Son of whom we speak, and we sitting on thrones in His kingdom over the world.<a name=246:8></a> It is therefore, I believe, never called "the Father's kingdom" -- but "My", "Their" -- "Your".<a name=246:9></a> It is called "His inheritance in the saints", and so "The Father of glory", "Called to his own kingdom and glory".<a name=246:10></a> It exalts us then to a very special place, as to us, in our persons.<a name=246:11></a> All shall then be subjected to Him, and the glory will be perfect to Him of redemption as regards us, and therefore with us He, as Son, will be in the Father's kingdom as individuals, while He yet reigns in an undelivered kingdom -- His earthly kingdom, in which there are yet things which remain to be subjected.<a name=246:12></a> In this we are now upon earth, and therefore it is its patience (see Apocalypse), and this is the force and explanation of the latter part of <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>.<a name=246:13></a>

		THE CHRISTIAN POSITION
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There have been three characters in which God has been revealed -- God Almighty -- Jehovah -- "Our Father which art in heaven"; all most important.<a name=252:1></a> The first inclusive, and, in one sense essential, attached to the name of God.<a name=252:2></a> The others bringing into closer affiance, into closer applicability to, the character of God -- names of more direct personal relationship.<a name=252:3></a> While the glory is maintained, and the blessedness enhanced of the Lord God, we have these definitely set out in Scripture -- to Abraham, the representative of all at Sinai, and in the Lord Jesus "Thy holy child Jesus".<a name=252:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But what I would now notice is that in learning the character of God as "Our Father which art in heaven" -- the Christian relationship to Him therefore in the New Testament said "Thee, the only true God" -- we are not to lose the others.<a name=252:5></a> In truth they were all centred in the Lord Jesus as God manifest in the flesh, and there we learn it, and, in proportion to the measure of the Spirit, exercise the faith in it, though the Father is the specific relationship "Our Father", He in whom we know Him being the Son, but we also know the Lord -- He was the Lord.<a name=252:6></a> "No one can call Jesus Lord but by the Spirit of God".<a name=252:7></a> His Almighty Person indeed is not fully manifested, described until <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#4">Revelation  4</a>and 11: 17 -- yet He was so.<a name=252:8></a> Hence it is manifest we have in presence them all; but see farther in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#4">Acts  4</a>, that while our relationship is with the Father and to dwell in the Father's house, still we act on the faith of these also "Lord, Thou art God which hast made", etc.<a name=252:9></a> Here we have the sovereign <i>pantokrator</i> (Almighty) -- men gathered against the Lord, "For of a truth against thy Holy Child Jesus" -- here is the fulfilment addressed as to the Father, as to the realised act, but recognised as being the God who made heaven and earth, etc.<a name=252:10></a> It was against Jehovah -- it all was -- but in fact owned as the present Father.<a name=252:11></a> Here also we find the accuracy of the scripture Word, for these two are characteristic in fact, or general subjection -- this is personally in relationship, "They shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty".<a name=252:12></a> It is our duty thus practically to recognise these things, be perfect in them, though specially as children.<a name=252:13></a> Jesus shows them, "The same yesterday, today and for ever" -- "All power in heaven and on earth" -- and "The Son, the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we find the rejection of the Wisdom of God in John the baptist, and in Christ in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#11:16">Matthew  11:16</a> - 19, and then the justification of the children of Wisdom -- the thoughts of the Lord upbraiding them for rejection as manifested -- His calling the children of Wisdom.<a name=253:2></a> Further the comfort of Christ in submitting to the will of God in seeing the counsel of God as to all things, and the call of babes -- His actual and moral purpose -- upon the trouble, and apparent failure, of the rejection by the world; for His sovereignty and moral character are brought out together, and not one without the other, though the general character also, and the Sovereignty in title of Christ was hence by His coming to the world -- all this is wonderfully brought out in the faithful feelings of our Lord's mind at the close of this chapter.<a name=253:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But it leads to something further as to the universality of Christ's work.<a name=253:4></a> All Christ's work, as done by Him, must have reference to, must embrace the world -- He could take nothing less as His due.<a name=253:5></a> The whole was His title -- He came as Man to men, and as Son and so heir He had right to all the world.<a name=253:6></a> The work of Christ as presented, as what He should expect as the Man of promise, was therefore to have the world.<a name=253:7></a> The Heir of the world was the promise -- Christ was the seed to whom it was confirmed everyway, therefore, in His responsibility as Man, in His title, and in His dispensation of promise, the world and nothing less was the portion of His work as Man, His title as Son, His inheritance as Heir of promise -- in a word, Christ had title to the world, and He came in love -- that title He must be conscious of, and He came in love about it, "For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world", etc.<a name=253:8></a> Hence as present in humiliation, this was true, and when He takes the inheritance in Person it is equally true -- He could have no less expectation as then manifested, for the witness of the love, the necessity was such, "God sent his Son into the world".<a name=253:9></a> He will have nothing less when He appears.<a name=253:10></a> This was shown in Adam also, in the history, see <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2:18">Genesis  2:18</a>, 19.<a name=253:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But here was the greatest, the grand hinge of Christ's submission, "Though he were a Son", and therefore Heir of all things, "Yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered".<a name=253:12></a> He came in love -- He came in title -- and the "world knew him not", and "His own received him not";

		"Then have I laboured in vain, saith He, and spent my strength for nought".<a name=254:1></a> This was His deep anger against the scribes and Pharisees in the Gospel of Matthew -- this His upbraiding in this chapter.<a name=254:2></a> He had to bear the rejection of the world, not only in the patience of suffering, but as the disappointment of all the purpose for which He was manifested as alive in the flesh, "While I am in the world, I am the light of the world".<a name=254:3></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the sovereignty of love in giving certain, in spite of universal rejection, to Him as the Church of the risen Christ; for it was Christ, the Anointed One of the Holy Ghost, who loved the Church which He saw in Spirit when rejected by the world, and the exercise of this speciality of love in dying for them, "Having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end".<a name=254:13></a> He learned this before, in His rejection, He could teach it to others and does teach it to others.<a name=254:14></a> In the meanwhile the Church was given to Him, on His rejection by the world, as His comfort and fulness in the world, and in the Lordship of all things in heaven and on earth, in which He should be ruling over it when He bringeth the only begotten into the world.<a name=254:15></a> This explains too "The fulness of the Gentiles" -- this makes us know what "His yoke" means; see <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#50">Isaiah  50</a>, and read <a href="../bible/John.htm#12">John  12</a>too.<a name=254:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now our Lord teaches us, from having experienced the blessing of submission, and the bright prospect of love which the submission to this Sovereignty brought in, to take His yoke and learn of Him, for He is "Meek and lowly in heart".<a name=255:8></a> This is the point of instruction, though it rested on all things as given.<a name=255:9></a> No man knoweth who the Son is, and His ineffable dignity and Person, nor the Father, save the Son and He to whom the Son will reveal Him.<a name=255:10></a>

		There can be no doubt that a Christian, with Christ's Spirit, desires the salvation of everybody with whom he is brought into intercourse in that Spirit, and seeks it in Spirit; at the same time he may be conscious, knowing that none but God's elect may come in, that this person may prove a very hater of Jesus, and, when he does so, he abhors him utterly, and he endures all things for the elect's sake that they may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.<a name=256:6></a> I am quite conscious of the two feelings -- in weakness surely -- as distinctly and as knowing them to be of God, as I see them in Scripture.<a name=256:7></a> The Spirit of God walks in love through the world, but it endures and labours in the consciousness that the elect are the portion which it shall bring in blessing to God.<a name=256:8></a> Thus it is said that "Christ loved the Church", not "Jesus", not simply "God", but "Christ", i.<a name=256:9></a>e.<a name=256:10></a>, He, anointed with the fulness of the Spirit in which He entered into and felt with the mind of God, He, as the Bridegroom, and knowing this place in the Spirit in which as risen He was to be, gave Himself for it.<a name=256:11></a> The great point is, in seeing our Lord, to recognise the distinction of His acting -- of His earnest desire in acting, and in the highest point of acting, acting from Himself, and yet acting in perfect and sole obedience -- Christ did in the Spirit and the Person of the Son.<a name=256:12></a> He acted <i>aph e(m)autou</i> (from him [my] self) and so laid down His life, yet He did it as <i>tauten ten entolen elabon</i> (this commandment have I received) in simple obedience.<a name=256:13></a> He came to do the will of Him that sent Him, not His own; now this was reconciled in suffering.<a name=256:14></a> If I willingly put myself in a place of suffering, I put myself into the place of patience or obedience -- so did the Lord, and said "Therefore", as a man, "Not my will but thine be done".<a name=256:15></a> Different parties have taken up either of these separate from the other, and both have marred Christ, and this is the real point between the Irvingites and anti-Irvingites <i>quoad hoc</i>, and while both have one end of truth, it appears to me that they neither know the real truth of the

		THE LORD'S COMING AND THE CHURCH

	<div class="paragraph">
		If there be a spiritual coming of the Lord, it was clearly the first coming, for though He came truly in the flesh, He was not so known save spiritually -- none could come to Him, as so come in the flesh, save the Father which had sent Him drew them; "It is the Spirit that quickeneth, the flesh profiteth nothing, the words that I speak unto you they are Spirit and they are Life".<a name=275:1></a> Accordingly He spake and was known in testimony -- He was known as the Word by His words, they had the power in which He appeared, to draw to Himself then; "He that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life".<a name=275:2></a>

		It was only spiritually He was known, though He was manifested in the flesh -- it was only in the word which He spake that He was received, for they which believed on Him by miracles He would not commit Himself to.<a name=275:3></a> In a word, as it was hearing the word and keeping the word which was the sowing of the Son of Man, so it was not manifestation to men, but veiled, and manifested to be the Person (though men ought to have known Him) only to those whose eyes were opened by His word to see Him through the Father's grace.<a name=275:4></a> This is argued in <a href="../bible/John.htm#6">John  6</a>, and its principles opened out in chapter 8.<a name=275:5></a> So John came in the spirit and power of Elias, though he was that very, true one of whom the prophets had testified.<a name=275:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The real personal coming, if we should distinguish, of the Lord Jesus, though the same true one then, is then in manifestation clearly the second, when it shall not be merely a revelation to believers of Him; for the point of <a href="../bible/John.htm#6">John  6</a>is that it was as really so when He was present in the flesh as when exalted and hid with God -- but "every eye shall see him, they also which pierced him".<a name=275:7></a> It is clear this is far more thoroughly personal, than appearing as the carpenter's son revealed only to those who were drawn of the Father as given unto Him.<a name=275:8></a> Christ is spiritually present now; so effectually He was when in the days of His flesh, for He then came not judging or executing judgment, which He must do in Person, but testifying in the word of testimony -- spiritually received then indeed in Person in the execution of judgment -- the great governing ordinance of God, in which He Himself is honoured in the execution of it.<a name=275:9></a>

		The Lord, after saying He was the "bread come down from heaven to give life to the world", tells us "Except ye eat the flesh and drink the blood of the Son of Man, ye have no life in you", making the realisation of His death essential to having life, for the blood separate from the flesh is the state of death; to which He adds, "What and if ye shall see the Son of Man ascend up where he was before".<a name=291:9></a> This is the more definite because in the preceding chapter He presents Himself as giving life with the Father, "Quickening whom he will" -- here as the Object of faith, incarnate, dead, and going back to heaven, only the last in a new state in which man never was before.<a name=291:10></a>

		THE SON OF MAN
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The use of the term "Son of Man" is worthy of closer remark.<a name=296:1></a> Christ never calls Himself "the Christ" save to the woman of Samaria, outside Judaism; <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>.<a name=296:2></a> He confesses it before the chief priests, that He is the Christ the Son of the Blessed, but then His own testimony is "Moreover" (<i>plen</i>) "I say unto you, Henceforth" (not hereafter) "ye shall see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of power" -- so Stephen saw Him (but that was a vision for one "full of the Holy Ghost") and yet standing -- and "coming in the clouds of heaven", i.<a name=296:3></a>e.<a name=296:4></a>, they would from that out only see Him in that way.<a name=296:5></a> He calls Himself "Son of Man" continually -- it is His name of predilection in the first three Gospels -- in John more frequently "Son of God".<a name=296:6></a> In John it is used as to the place He has already taken, for He comes into the world, and the Jews are rejected, and His Person as divine while on earth and as to the Cross, see chapter 3; in chapter 4 for His Body given for the life of men and ascending up -- Christ on earth; in chapter 5 judgment given to Him because He is such.<a name=296:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Men never call Him "Son of Man", save Stephen as seeing Him in heaven, which after what He said to the Jews is very significant, as is His not being yet set down.<a name=296:8></a> Save these cases, the term is used as suffering -- as Lord of all -- forgiving -- in grace seeking and saving what was lost -- or coming again in power and glory; as a general rule suffering and rejected, or coming again in glory.<a name=296:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the Old Testament the name is only used in respect of future glory and power, in <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#7">Daniel  7</a>and <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8">Psalm  8</a>.<a name=296:10></a> The "made a little lower than the angels" of the latter is used in Hebrews as being in order to be able to suffer death.<a name=296:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The term is used in Revelation, "One like unto the Son of man", as judging in the midst of the Churches, and as coming in the clouds of heaven.<a name=296:12></a> In one Psalm (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#80">Psalm  80</a>) He is viewed as the future Deliverer of Israel, who is to come.<a name=296:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This explains the character of John's Gospel also, where the divine nature of Christ and His oneness with the Father is so clearly stated -- having taken already the place of Son of man, He is always divine, but always recipient and dependent.<a name=297:4></a> It is not the Kingdom but the Person -- a divine one -- the Son one with the Father, but the Son of man who has taken the subject place, as we have often seen, all through.<a name=297:5></a> This is most important in itself, and for the understanding of John's Gospel, and most blessed.<a name=297:6></a> The whole of chapter 17 brings it out very strikingly, where He brings the disciples into His own place, and having brought the Son into Man, He brings men to be sons with Him -- by Him, but with Him.<a name=297:7></a> This is very lovely.<a name=297:8></a> And this is His eternal place consequently, only then glorified of course, as He demands in chapter 17, "Glorify thou me".<a name=297:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		His Person comes out strikingly in such passages as "The Son of Man who is in heaven".<a name=297:10></a> But although John distinctly uses it in the way and for the reason mentioned in connection with His Person -- the Man down here, yet "The Son of man who is in heaven" -- "That meat .<a name=297:11></a>.<a name=297:12></a>.<a name=297:13></a> which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed" -- yet the death and future glory are not lost sight of in connection with it, only it holds fast the Person as a present thing.<a name=297:14></a> We have it in chapter 6, and we have it when the Greeks come up, adding that the corn of wheat must fall into the ground and die or it abode alone.<a name=297:15></a> "The Son of man must be lifted up"; and this goes further than "The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation".<a name=297:16></a> In John it is directly connected with God -- His nature and Christ's work -- yet on the part of man towards God, the other side following under the title of "Son of God".<a name=297:17></a> But in John it has a most blessed and revealing character, which is indeed the gist of the whole Gospel, adding "The other Comforter".<a name=297:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In John the "Son of Man" is first seen in chapter 1 with the Angels of God serving Him as their special object.<a name=298:4></a> Then He is "Son of man who is in heaven", but came down from it.<a name=298:5></a> He "must be lifted up, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life".<a name=298:6></a> This "lifting up" is always in connection with the Son of man.<a name=298:7></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		After chapter 3, chapter 6 next takes up the Son of man.<a name=298:10></a> There He is the One "sealed of the Father", but again "come down from heaven" -- His flesh and blood to be eaten (to go up where He was before).<a name=298:11></a> If "lifted up" He was to draw all men.<a name=298:12></a> This "lifting up" was clearly His death, but His death as "lifted up", and this word seems to me of importance -- His death as rejected and cast out of the earth, but thereby connected with heaven, and the Object of faith to the earth, i.<a name=298:13></a>e.<a name=298:14></a>, to men on it as consciously lost then, but no longer of it.<a name=298:15></a> Hence connected with the Son of man, and contrasted by the people with Christ (Messiah) abiding as they thought ever, according to the law; as "Christ" and "Son of man" are contrasted in themselves in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#9">Luke  9</a>.<a name=298:16></a>

		He is "lifted up" in chapter 3, in connection with dying men, like the brazen serpent, and as introducing to heavenly things; He is "lifted up" in chapter 8 in connection with the utter rejection of the Jews; He is "lifted up" in chapter 12, drawing all men unto Him -- the wide sphere of application here below -- all this by His death.<a name=299:8></a> These are the only cases of the use of the word regarding Christ.<a name=299:9></a>

		The same truth is brought out as to our future condition and present realisation of it, in Jude: "Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy".<a name=303:22></a> So in 1 Peter: "In whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory".<a name=303:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we have to connect the heavenly character of Christ's priesthood with its care of our earthly state, of which it takes account.<a name=304:2></a> The way of this in Hebrews is evident -- not as the Jewish priests compassed with infirmity while priests, but "tempted in all points like as we are" on earth, sin excepted, and perfect in heavenly glory when exercised on high where He is.<a name=304:3></a> But we are connected with both.<a name=304:4></a> Such a High Priest became us, holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, higher than the heavens, but withal One that can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, as passing through this world of sin and trial.<a name=304:5></a> But this shows in a wonderful way our place -- "For such a High Priest became us".<a name=304:6></a> We are called to association with what is undefiled and higher than the heavens, and yet experience a care which applies to infirmities, weakness and need.<a name=304:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But this, as association, calls up into heavenly things, and identifies us spiritually with them, but at the same time morally with every heart-exercise in which, while it brings us into dependence, the deepest and fullest sympathies are woven into our hearts in One who has been and who is divine in His love and human in His sorrows, and touched with the feeling of our infirmities, in a grace which knows them and was perfect in them.<a name=304:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a great thing to have the heart met where it is, and to be taken from where it is to brighter and better scenes where He is who perfectly knows both, but belongs to the highest though He has descended to the lowest for our sakes.<a name=304:9></a> And that makes it all sweetness in the sorrows, and yet our hope and life where all is bright in the holiness of God, and the love is found which has been the source of all the grace.<a name=304:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How infinite, how perfect on every side is the grace, not one element wanting up to God Himself, and Him we call our Father!<a name=304:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Note, there are three ways in which the priesthood of Christ is presented in the Epistle to the Hebrews.<a name=304:12></a> First, in His sympathy with those He is not ashamed to call His brethren as in chapters 2 and 4; then as that on which the whole religious system depends; thirdly as representing the people -- not so much a priestly act but as the High Priest represented

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is however this difference between chapters 2 and 4 as to the priesthood; chapter 2 while showing Christ made higher than the heavens, insists on His being made like unto His brethren -- truly a Man in flesh and blood so as to feel as a man for the saints in their trial.<a name=305:2></a> Chapter 4 on the other hand specially looks at Him as gone up on high, a High Priest who has gone up through the heavens, and speaks only of "was" as to His suffering being tempted.<a name=305:3></a> This was needed to give the place and exercise of His priesthood, the former (chapter 2) to show how He came down, and was Man to be qualified for it.<a name=305:4></a> In chapter 5 as in chapter 4 it is the exalted place in priesthood, only again He had, in the days of His flesh, passed through the trial so as to pass thence, fitted in compassion, into the place of its exercise.<a name=305:5></a>

		The government of God, however imperfectly manifested outwardly, is yet exercised at any rate as to His children, and is in result with the world.<a name=306:1></a> It is exercised according to His judgment of what is right and what is wrong.<a name=306:2></a> He makes good His righteousness in government though all be not yet apparent; and so Job and Elihu reasoned, but not with adequate present witness, of which we can judge, and what modifies it apparently, with all patience and long-suffering it is not "speedily executed".<a name=306:3></a> Through this, when His saints err from Him, they must go; He maintains His true character.<a name=306:4></a> Hence they are difficultly saved.<a name=306:5></a> God must, after His patience, bring the trial which expresses what He is and proves what man is.<a name=306:6></a> And when it comes, it sweeps on to its results dragging on men with its stream.<a name=306:7></a> How are the righteous to get through this?<a name=306:8></a> This is the point, in Peter, of the difficulty -- as Lot and Sodom, the just and the ungodly and the sinner in Peter.<a name=306:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But then while the government of God maintains its own principles and respects not persons, and meets His children in an erring path and overthrows them, it maintains His way and overthrows them if they cross it.<a name=306:10></a> But then with the saint He goes through this -- much deeper into the soul.<a name=306:11></a> He does not merely correct the way, but lets His mind in as to the spirit that led to it.<a name=306:12></a> The will is broken -- we find what we are -- the soul, which had gone its own way, finds itself again with God, though sorrowfully, and God is known -- the state of the soul is changed, it is not the free exercise of will, but the siftings and subduedness of a soul that has to say to God, and the happiness that accompanies it, though this last way be regained through trial.<a name=306:13></a> If there be any motive which has led astray, or any evil, and not merely levity and estrangement of heart from God, any false confidence in the soul, it is judged, of course.<a name=306:14></a>

		The connection and place of peace in Luke, and as to the last or application to us, in John also, is extremely interesting.<a name=308:1></a> As soon as Christ is born, the unjealous delight in the divine glory in man's blessing celebrates His birth.<a name=308:2></a> They pass over man's fault in putting the Saviour born into the manger, and, filled entirely with the divine thoughts in it, celebrate His praise.<a name=308:3></a> And what was this?<a name=308:4></a> "Glory to God in the highest, on earth peace, good pleasure in man".<a name=308:5></a> That was the result in its own nature of the birth of the Saviour.<a name=308:6></a> This presence of the Lord, the fruit of infinite grace, was in itself, if received, peace and blessing -- carried it necessarily in what it was in itself -- and will produce it finally.<a name=308:7></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the end of Luke, the Kingdom is celebrated, which will indeed bring in peace on the earth.<a name=308:10></a> There it is said: "Blessed be the King that cometh.<a name=308:11></a> Peace in heaven and glory in the highest".<a name=308:12></a> All that God had done on earth had been marred and spoilt by Satan, and as long as these wicked spirits were in heavenly places, thus it must be.<a name=308:13></a> But there is war in heaven, and the devil and his angels are cast out, and there is no more place for them.<a name=308:14></a> Then there is peace in heaven -- Satan is bound.<a name=308:15></a> Now there can be peace on earth, and under the Lord's rule there will be peace.<a name=308:16></a> But between these two we stand.<a name=308:17></a> And in that same Gospel of Luke, the Lord comes after His resurrection and pronounces "Peace" on His disciples.<a name=308:18></a> But this was a peace of a far deeper and fuller character, not peace on earth, governmental peace, but peace made with God.<a name=308:19></a> He had made peace, perfect peace, so that the soul might enjoy cloudless communion with Him -- all that is of the world or of this scene, as alive in it, being shut out.<a name=308:20></a> He had brought them, or had done what brought them into this peace by His death, and now He pronounced it.<a name=308:21></a> And if we turn to John, this will shine out with the brightest evidence.<a name=308:22></a> The Lord had warned His disciples that He did not come to bring peace, but a sword; so that the peace on earth was not there, but the fire already kindled.<a name=308:23></a> But He had ineffable peace of soul as not of the world -- He was in, and His soul in

		The peace of the Christian is not the same as being justified -- "Being justified, we have peace with God".<a name=309:5></a> This must be according to His nature; hence completely what He is, which makes it very blessed, and though in us connected with our being alienated and enemies by sin, yet in itself is only measured by what He was before sin existed -- the outgoing of His own nature in itself before sin, and we in absolute harmony with its full display and proper nature.<a name=309:6></a> Sin has been the means of bringing us to know what holiness, righteousness, love are, but they are all in God -- the last is His nature.<a name=309:7></a> Thus in seeing what Christ says, we learn what it is.<a name=309:8></a> "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you".<a name=309:9></a> Now His peace was consonance in every way with the divine nature, and the consciousness of communion with it -- that it rested on Him unclouded, but that was not by sin put away.<a name=309:10></a> It was in itself divine and, though now in a Man, eternal consonance.<a name=309:11></a> Now for us, of course, it had to be made -- "He has made peace by the blood of the Cross", and this was so perfect, as to the whole nature and character of God, that He was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father -- is glorified with God in virtue of that work in which He glorified God perfectly and in respect of what we are as sinners, but glorified God perfectly.<a name=309:12></a>

		WALKING WORTHY
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My attention has been drawn to the use of "Walking worthy".<a name=311:1></a> In Ephesians we see clearly its connection with the noticed force and character of the Epistle.<a name=311:2></a> This treats of the Christian and then of the Church's privileges, and the saint is to "walk worthy of his vocation" here, especially in Church place, and the worthiness to be of that.<a name=311:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Colossians, where the glory of the Person of Christ is brought out as they were slipping away from the Head -- I do not say His headship, but the glory of Him who is Head -- they are to "walk worthy of the Lord".<a name=311:4></a> It is in this part that God and Father, the Lord and the Spirit are brought out.<a name=311:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the Thessalonians, who, from being heathens, had been brought to know the one true God, the Father -- "The Assembly of the Thessalonians which is in God the Father" having not intermediate and indeed demon powers, but being in direct, immediate relationship with the one true God, they are called to "walk worthy of God who has called us to his own kingdom and glory" -- so they were "turned to God from idols, to serve the living and true God".<a name=311:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Philippians, in which we have the experimental condition of the Christian, and the Gospel is spoken of as in conflict in the world (Paul being in the bonds of it) they were to "walk worthy of the Gospel".<a name=311:7></a> So Paul was "set for the confirmation and defence of the Gospel" -- he speaks of the "beginning of the Gospel" -- Timothy had served with him "for the Gospel" -- the women had "contended with him in the Gospel" -- Paul was set "for the defence of the Gospel" -- they had fellowship "in the furtherance of the Gospel".<a name=311:8></a> So it will be seen that when they are called to walk worthy of it, conflict is also spoken of, for which a right walk was needed, but they were not to be terrified by their adversaries.<a name=311:9></a> The true Gospel was as a cause, as a person in conflict in the world -- they who stood by it as one they contended along with, were to walk worthy of it.<a name=311:10></a> They were "striving together with the faith of the Gospel", contending along with the faith of the Gospel in the world -- not "for" the faith, but "with" it, as an associate with it in its conflicts.<a name=311:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is thus in the three "walkings worthy", I think, a practical difference though essentially the same.<a name=311:12></a> In Thessalonians it is the essential measure and its nature -- "Worthy of

		CONSCIOUSNESS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would say a word on consciousness.<a name=315:1></a> It is used, I think, in two senses -- consciousness, properly speaking, and reflection on "I", or the conscious person.<a name=315:2></a> They are so closely connected, it is no wonder; but the difference is important, for I apprehend it is just the difference between a beast and a man in this respect.<a name=315:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The living "I" is always a will in thought or for act, and consciously wills -- wills, knowing it wills -- so does even a beast.<a name=315:4></a> If it wants to get out of a room, it knows it wants it.<a name=315:5></a> Will is always conscious of itself, but it does not set about to reflect therefore on itself as I am doing now (<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#36:315">footnote</a></i>).<a name=315:6></a>

		This reflective self-consciousness is man's distinctive prerogative, as having a spirit.<a name=315:7></a> "I" has the power of using the upper faculty to reflect on the workings of "I".<a name=315:8></a> I reflect, but the capacity is in the spirit of man.<a name=315:9></a> "There is", says Elihu, "a spirit in man".<a name=315:10></a> But how was this before the fall?<a name=315:11></a> I mean as to "will".<a name=315:12></a> And here I have to remark that I think "will" is used in two ways -- intention, the tendency of nature or "I", towards something, and the determination of "I" to go out towards that something, and where this question is raised in a moral ground.<a name=315:13></a>

		All will is sin, because it is not obedience, i.<a name=315:14></a>e.<a name=315:15></a>, is assumed independence of God, and much more.<a name=315:16></a> Now unfallen Adam had no such will as this.<a name=315:17></a> It was tested in the tree, and he ought to have said "I can have no will -- I obey" -- but he distrusted and willed.<a name=315:18></a> But in the place where God had set him, as dressing the garden and keeping it, nature was free in the sphere God had given it authority in; and so as to animals.<a name=315:19></a> Here God had given authority, and will was in its place while the whole man was subject to God.<a name=315:20></a> But he used a will in the sphere of testing obedience and was lost -- Christ in the most perfect testing said "Not my will but thine be done".<a name=315:21></a> His tendency of nature and "I" to escape suffering was right -- that suffering eminently so.<a name=315:22></a> He had, being a perfect Man, a will of nature and morally too, but no will which willed when God's will was there.<a name=315:23></a> This is commonly, in its grosser form, called "Self-will".<a name=315:24></a> It is the determination of "I" to have its own way.<a name=315:25></a>

		Now the determination of Christ's "I" was to have God's will absolutely -- that will from heaven down (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#40">Psalm  40</a>) was His only motive for acting.<a name=316:1></a> He was the obedient Man.<a name=316:2></a> We have a will which strives (not merely suffers) and it is checked -- right it should be -- but that was not Christ's case.<a name=316:3></a> His whole moral being was obedience, "I come to do thy will" -- "Not my will but thine be done".<a name=316:4></a> The desire and intention of nature not to suffer was there, rightly there, but His determination, His only and perfect one, was to do God's will, suffering bring what it might.<a name=316:5></a> Save the testing point, there was with Adam no determination of will called for or <i>in posse</i>.<a name=316:6></a>

		THE HEADSHIP OF CHRIST
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The question has been raised how far Christ gives up the glory and headship spoken of in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1">Ephesians  1</a>, drawn, as in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15">1 Corinthians  15</a>and <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2">Hebrews  2</a>, from <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8">Psalm  8</a>.<a name=317:1></a> He gives up the kingdom, that is certain, when He has subdued all principalities and power.<a name=317:2></a> His divine glory into which He has taken manhood is immutable, that is also clear.<a name=317:3></a> It is a question of His relative place, not His Person.<a name=317:4></a> We must, I think, distinguish between our relative place and conferred authority.<a name=317:5></a> This last Christ gives up.<a name=317:6></a> He is exalted now, but He has not yet taken to Him His great power and reigned, nor is He sitting on His throne yet, but on His Father's.<a name=317:7></a> He is become so much higher than the angels, having by inheritance a more excellent name than they -- this is His place.<a name=317:8></a> Angels, principalities and powers being subject to Him -- that is relative authority, though not yet the reign.<a name=317:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We have a place above angels, as united to Him, and as the fruit of redemption, and shall be made like unto Him.<a name=317:10></a> All this, I apprehend, continues -- "Glory in the Church by Jesus Christ, world without end".<a name=317:11></a> It must be in Him.<a name=317:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I see in Ephesians two things -- "Exalted him above every name", and "Put all things in subjection under his feet"; just as Adam was quite above the creatures, and besides had dominion over them, which was God's will, not a necessary consequence nor the same thing, only the second Adam has companions though He be anointed above them.<a name=317:13></a> This subjection of all things to His personal authority He will give up, not merely the kingdom looked at as a millennial reign, but the "all things" subjected to Him.<a name=317:14></a> He has not to put down angels and saints who delight in His glory, but those who oppose it and who are rebellious against God, and the fruit of creature-will and sin; but administrative authority is given up -- not only Godhead of course, but, I suppose, personal exaltation remains.<a name=317:15></a> I do not mean merely personal pre-eminence as Son of God, for that too cannot be otherwise.<a name=317:16></a> It is not merely the "Son of Man is set", but "This is my beloved Son".<a name=317:17></a> But His relatively taken place remains.<a name=317:18></a>

		He gives it up and is subject; but He does not cease, as to His place taken as Man, to be superior to the angels, even when there is no question of His throne, for that is conferred rule -- is given up, as we know from Corinthians, and He takes as Man the place of subjection, the perfect personal place -- for rule is not.<a name=318:1></a> That refers to what is below us, here even to what has to be subjected -- "Head over all things", in this sense, is given up.<a name=318:2></a> But the raised Son never ceases to be the Centre of the whole company of heaven, and the saints with Him, "the firstborn among many brethren", "the only begotten".<a name=318:3></a> As God He of course possesses all things with the Father, but, as to His place as Man, He is not only the Head of all principalities and powers, but far above all principality and power, and by the necessity of His Person and title always will be -- it is His place, when righteousness dwells, when it no longer reigns; He is always "Firstborn", when He no longer reigns in His conferred dominion.<a name=318:4></a> Though in another sense we shall reign for ever and ever.<a name=318:5></a>
