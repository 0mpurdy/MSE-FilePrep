		MAN FALLEN AND THE SEED OF THE WOMAN

	<div class="paragraph">
		Genesis 3
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not only Scripture which makes known to us that there is sin and misery in the world.<a name=1:1></a> There they are, even if Scripture or a Saviour did not exist.<a name=1:2></a> The world is a ruin.<a name=1:3></a> Man knows well that iniquity and defilement are in him; and nobody is satisfied with his portion here below, because his heart is ill at ease.<a name=1:4></a> The word of God explains, as nothing else can, how Satan entered the world, and reveals the consequence of sin in man's relations with God.<a name=1:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thing the old serpent did was to put something between the creature and the Creator, to put himself between God and man.<a name=1:6></a> This was subtle, and ruinous if successful, as it was; for the only thing which makes us happy is that there is nothing between -- that God loves us.<a name=1:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Satan begins then by producing distrust in God, and so stirring man's will into activity in lust and disobedience.<a name=1:8></a> Never does the enemy lead one to think of the goodness of God nor of man's obedience.<a name=1:9></a> The woman knew right well that she ought not to eat of the tree, and that mischief must be the result; yet she ate, and gave to her husband with her, and he did eat (verse 1-6).<a name=1:10></a> Thus sin is the self-will that sprang from the unbelief which doubted God.<a name=1:11></a> By this means Satan made a breach; he persuaded Eve that God kept something for Himself, for fear that His creature should be too happy and too blessed.<a name=1:12></a> But Eve was wrong in listening to Satan; she ought not for a moment to have attended to the voice which insinuated distrust in God.<a name=1:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God has warned man of the consequences of sin, as Adam, "in the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die.<a name=1:14></a>" But Satan, who seeks always to deny the righteousness of God, says to the woman, "ye shall not surely die; for God doth know that in the day that ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.<a name=1:15></a>" Nor was this altogether untrue.<a name=1:16></a> The fall has rendered man much more intelligent relatively to good and evil.<a name=1:17></a> But Satan hid from man that he should be separated from God and have a bad conscience.<a name=1:18></a> "And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig-leaves together, and made themselves aprons" (verse 7).<a name=1:19></a> They acquired a knowledge that shewed them their nakedness, which they strove to conceal from the eyes of themselves and each other.<a name=1:20></a> All that is brought near us appears to us more important and greater than what is still far off.<a name=1:21></a> The forbidden tree being near Eve, and the judgment of God being distant, she took of the fruit, and ate.<a name=1:22></a>

		So the spirit of falsehood tells men at this day that they shall not die, and that the threats of God shall not come to pass.<a name=2:1></a> He conceals the warnings of God, and then men do what Satan and their own lusts urge them on to do.<a name=2:2></a> If a Christian even is not watchful, his conscience will lose its activity, and, in place of seeing God, he sees his nakedness.<a name=2:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Man, besides, takes leaves to cover his nakedness.<a name=2:4></a> He does his utmost to conceal from himself the evil which has happened to him; but when God is revealed, it is quite otherwise.<a name=2:5></a> God draws near, as if nothing had occurred; then the nearness to God, which would have been a joy for man without sin, becomes on account of sin a source of immense terror, and insupportable.<a name=2:6></a> "Adam and his wife hide themselves from the presence of Jehovah Elohim amongst the trees of the garden.<a name=2:7></a>" They had succeeded in veiling their nakedness from their own eyes; they were terrified at the voice of God, and strove to hide from Him.<a name=2:8></a> What a horrible thing for man to be in such a case as to wish concealment from God!<a name=2:9></a> (verse 7, 8).<a name=2:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Adam "was afraid," as he confessed to Him who called him from his hiding-place.<a name=2:11></a> Conscience trembles at the presence of God.<a name=2:12></a> Every hope of enjoying life is taken away when His voice is heard.<a name=2:13></a> Man is self-convicted of departure from God because of sin.<a name=2:14></a> God "drove out the man"; but man had himself fled from His presence first.<a name=2:15></a> His own conscience told him that he could not stand before God; and God made this evident by the words of His call to Adam, "Where art thou?<a name=2:16></a>" (verse 9).<a name=2:17></a> He was gone from God, banished by conscience before God drove him out.<a name=2:18></a> Is he then the one to complain of unrighteousness, whose own heart condemned him similarly before God's sentence was pronounced?<a name=2:19></a> The relations of man were thenceforth broken, and in a manner irreparable, as far as man is concerned.<a name=2:20></a> "I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself" (verse 10).<a name=2:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Self-justification is as vain as seeking to hide from God.<a name=2:22></a> "And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked?<a name=2:23></a> Hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?<a name=2:24></a> And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat" (verse 11, 12).<a name=2:25></a> How is the mighty fallen!<a name=2:26></a> The head of creation stooping, in order to excuse himself of his sin, to cast the fault on his wife -- yea, on God Himself!<a name=2:27></a> How debasing is evil once allowed, and dominant!<a name=2:28></a> No slavery more degrading, none so immediate and all-corrupting in its effects.<a name=2:29></a> Was man then the weaker vessel?<a name=2:30></a> or this the way of natural affection?<a name=2:31></a> The hardest thing for a sinner to do is to confess his sin truly and thoroughly; to judge oneself is only the fruit of grace through faith.<a name=2:32></a> A bad conscience dreads God and the consequences too much to confess, while it knows its sin too well to deny it.<a name=2:33></a>

		But God will have sin out, and trace it to its source.<a name=3:1></a> "And Jehovah Elohim said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done?<a name=3:2></a> And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.<a name=3:3></a> And Jehovah Elohim said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life: and I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.<a name=3:4></a> Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.<a name=3:5></a> And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken; for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return" (verse 13-19).<a name=3:6></a>

		If you had full confidence in God, and you were perfectly sure that God loved you, you would be very happy.<a name=3:7></a> But Satan is active, and his power consists in producing distrust, and this where there is happiness and intimate relation with God -- to darken, and, if possible, destroy all in the heart.<a name=3:8></a> He takes advantage of men who trust their own will and their efforts for their happiness, distrusting God, and neither willing nor knowing how to confide the care of their happiness to Him, and to give themselves up to His mighty love in Christ.<a name=3:9></a> And this he does now as ever.<a name=3:10></a> He persuades men that God is too good to condemn us because we are sinners; and man, spite of his sins and his conscience, hopes and persuades himself that he will not be condemned.<a name=3:11></a> It is the voice of the old serpent.<a name=3:12></a>

		But God has proved, even by the death of His Son, that He will not endure sin, and that its wages are death, as it will be judgment after death for all who believe not.<a name=4:1></a> The conscience being bad, all the effort of man is to hide from himself his nakedness before God.<a name=4:2></a> He would put out of the world gross and outward sin, drunkenness, murder, robbery.<a name=4:3></a> He seeks by laws and by philanthropic efforts to blot out the exterior effects of sin which shock the world.<a name=4:4></a> But these are but the aprons of fig-leaves, which root out nothing whatever, but serve for the moment to conceal from ourselves our nakedness and misery, and to avoid thinking of the righteousness of the condemnation God has pronounced from that day on our sinful state.<a name=4:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that sins have come between our consciences and God, one wishes at least that there should be something to hide us before God; and it is with this view that man employs what he calls innocent things.<a name=4:6></a> Thus the trees were innocent enough, but what use did Adam make of them?<a name=4:7></a> To hide behind them from God.<a name=4:8></a> God had given to man all that is in the world; but man now perverts it all to escape from the presence of God, pretending the while to be innocent in such an application of what is good in itself.<a name=4:9></a> When the voice of God awakens the conscience, one wishes still for something to hide us from Him; but this is impossible.<a name=4:10></a> "Where art thou?<a name=4:11></a>" said God to Adam, who had no means of concealment longer.<a name=4:12></a> If God were to say so to each of your souls, would it be your joy to be in His presence?<a name=4:13></a> God is really the only resource and refuge when we have sinned.<a name=4:14></a> It is only God who, by imputing nothing to the believer, takes away all guile from the spirit; Psalm 32.<a name=4:15></a> But if you hide away from God, how do you then stand for your souls?<a name=4:16></a> God had not yet driven from His presence Adam, who had fled away from Him.<a name=4:17></a> Conscience tell us that, if we have sinned and He is a righteous God, there are no leaves or trees to hide us in His presence.<a name=4:18></a> Man is miserable in his conscience, and he cannot be happy in sin, save only that there is no God.<a name=4:19></a> All the hope of incredulity is that there is no God, or, what comes to the same thing, that He is not righteous or holy.<a name=4:20></a> Adam wished to excuse himself, as if he had lusted after nothing himself -- he had only followed the voice of his wife, instead of keeping to the prohibition of God.<a name=4:21></a> But if there was no lust in us, no sinful act would result.<a name=4:22></a> He had disobeyed the word of God, for which he was responsible.<a name=4:23></a>

		In the midst of all the goodness of God, who has given His Son for poor sinners, if you have no confidence in God, there is the proof of your sin.<a name=5:1></a> No matter how it may be manifested, is not this ingratitude and distrust?<a name=5:2></a> Eve listened to and believed Satan, in place of listening to God and believing Him; and this is just what man is ever doing, while he hopes for salvation and eternal life, though he sins.<a name=5:3></a> All the efforts you make to be happy prove you are not.<a name=5:4></a> The immediate effect of God's presence in your hearts and consciences would be to stop your pleasures: if all your pleasures are thus incompatible with the presence of God, what will they be for you in eternity?<a name=5:5></a> Will they carry you to the foot of His throne who is holy and righteous, to shew Him that you have passed many innocent hours far from Him?<a name=5:6></a> What is there but disobedience, distrust, falsehood, self-will, unless it be a still worse thing, the state of soul which wishes to divert its thoughts away from the presence of God.<a name=5:7></a>

		Man may withdraw himself from the presence of God while grace lasts, but he cannot when God will judge him.<a name=5:8></a> Satan will help you to hide; your best friends following the world will help you also to keep away from the presence of God, to forget and deny it; but this will certainly not go beyond the time of grace which is granted you.<a name=5:9></a> Therefore, while it is called today, if you hear His voice, harden not your hearts.<a name=5:10></a>

		God knows that you are sinners; He knows that it is the subtle iniquity of Satan, which would make man his prey.<a name=5:11></a> But there is to that an answer, of which Satan knew not, any more than poor, guilty, fallen man: the revelation of the Seed of the woman (verse 15).<a name=5:12></a> The question is really between the serpent and the second Man -- not the first.<a name=5:13></a> It is neither a promise to Adam and Eve from God, nor a hope of improvement in their children; but God pronounces judgment on the enemy, and in the midst of it the revelation is made of the Saviour, child of the woman who had ensnared the man to be ruined of the devil.<a name=5:14></a> The woman's Seed shall bruise the serpent's head, but He is bruised Himself first.<a name=5:15></a> What grace, yet righteousness!<a name=5:16></a> What humiliation, yet victory!<a name=5:17></a> If Adam exalted himself as a robbery to be as God, He who was God emptied Himself to be a man, and became obedient unto death, as the other was disobedient unto it.<a name=5:18></a> To lost Adam, the first man, there was, and could be, no promise.<a name=5:19></a> All the promises of God are yea and amen in the second Man; but they become the portion of every believer.<a name=5:20></a> Faith finds and enjoys the promise, not sin and unbelief.<a name=5:21></a> To Eve and Adam God only speaks of the actual consequences of sin (verse 16-19).<a name=5:22></a> It is in judging the serpent (verse 15) that He reveals the coming Seed of the woman, and the way of His victory.<a name=5:23></a> Thenceforward the only hope of lost man is in this revealed Saviour; and before he is driven out he hears of what Jesus was to suffer in destroying the power of the devil; yet not a single sign of repentance appears in Adam after his sin.<a name=5:24></a> He had shewn terror of God, cowardly selfishness as to his wife, as much dishonesty in his own case as dishonour done to God.<a name=5:25></a> But God occupies Himself only with His counsels of grace in the woman's Seed, whose person and work and glory are developed in all the Scriptures.<a name=5:26></a>

		THE BLOOD OF THE LAMB

	<div class="paragraph">
		Exodus 12
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On the paschal night, when Jehovah struck the firstborn of the Egyptians, and passed over those of Israel, a groundwork was laid for the deliverance of Israel from their bondage to Pharaoh, a lively image of Christ, the Passover sacrificed for us; for we were slaves of Satan, as Pharaoh, king of Egypt, was prince of this world, and the people of God his bondsmen.<a name=8:1></a> But God was taking notice of the state of His people, visiting them, and about to deliver them.<a name=8:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In one sense Satan has rights over us as sinners, and the justice of God is against us, because He had said, "In the day that thou eatest [of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil] thou shalt surely die.<a name=8:3></a>" Thus Satan can accuse man, though he had said on the contrary, "Ye shall not surely die"; your case is not so utterly desperate as these Christians say.<a name=8:4></a> Satan is always the same liar as he was.<a name=8:5></a> God cannot say to the sinner as such, Thou shalt not die; but to deliver He must take notice of sin, and lay a righteous foundation, of which faith can avail itself by grace.<a name=8:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Pharaoh had power enough to keep the Israelites, and the more as they were accustomed to slavery, and latterly of the bitterest kind.<a name=8:7></a> Pharaoh had no real rights, any more than Satan.<a name=8:8></a> Meanwhile he deceives.<a name=8:9></a> Such is the state of the world.<a name=8:10></a> This is so true, that the higher one's place is in the world, the more one is really enslaved.<a name=8:11></a> A poor man may do many things in the street without any one taking notice of it: the rich man dares not to wound its conventionalities and usages.<a name=8:12></a> Our will contributes also to our slavery.<a name=8:13></a> If one were to tell us that we are directed, led, retained by Satan, we should not agree to it.<a name=8:14></a> In fact he employs the things of the world to drag us into sin.<a name=8:15></a> Judas was drawn into his sin because he loved money.<a name=8:16></a> Satan entered into his heart to harden his conscience, and to strengthen him in sin, by taking away from him all hope of the mercy of God.<a name=8:17></a> Thus there is first the lust, or desire; next the enemy furnishes the occasion or means of satisfying it; then he enters into us.<a name=8:18></a> Satan tries to retort the sin on others, and teaches us to do the same.<a name=8:19></a> So Adam said, "The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat," making of his heart an excuse for what his hand had done.<a name=8:20></a>

		In Egypt Israel became the object of controversy between God and Pharaoh, who represents Satan.<a name=9:1></a> The enemy says God has no right to claim them, for they are sinners.<a name=9:2></a> It is true that they are sinners; and it is necessary that man should completely bow to the justice of God which condemns him.<a name=9:3></a> If one is convinced of being lost, it is impossible that one should not seek salvation, perhaps blindly; still one seeks it every time that conscience is awakened.<a name=9:4></a> Without this, people content themselves with saying that God is good, that is, that He must take no account of sin.<a name=9:5></a> But ought God to make heaven like what the world is?<a name=9:6></a> And is not this just what would be if sin were to enter heaven?<a name=9:7></a> Could one give a measure to indicate up to what, and how much, people might sin?<a name=9:8></a> But our consciences also accuse and tell us that we cannot get rid of sin; and sin begets death.<a name=9:9></a>

		The fact that the Passover was to be eaten at night, and burnt, or nothing left to the morning, seems to intimate that it was entirely apart from the whole course and scene in which nature and sense are conversant, a matter between God and the soul, abstractedly in the undistracted claim and holiness of the divine nature.<a name=11:1></a> No circumstances entered into it, no question of compassionate apprehension of sin and misery.<a name=11:2></a> It was sin, and the holy judgment of God, where nothing else was.<a name=11:3></a>

		CHRIST A SWEET SAVOUR TO GOD FOR US

	<div class="paragraph">
		Leviticus 1, 2
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first sacrifice offered was one of sweet savour.<a name=12:1></a> For this there had to be taken of the cattle, from the herds or the flocks, a male without blemish representing Christ without sin.<a name=12:2></a> On its head the offerer laid his hand when brought before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, that it might be favourably received for him before Jehovah: not taking from the offerer his iniquities but transferring to him its sweet savour when wholly burnt on the altar, yet making atonement for him.<a name=12:3></a> If of fowls, the offering was to be of turtle doves or of young pigeons.<a name=12:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 2 we have a meat or rather a cake-offering of fine flour with oil poured on it and frankincense, which like the burnt-sacrifice was consumed on the altar, though not wholly, for the priest took from it his handful of the flour and of the oil with all the frankincense.<a name=12:5></a> Christ alone is unleavened.<a name=12:6></a> He was conceived of the Holy Ghost as well as Son of Mary, Matthew 1; Luke 1.<a name=12:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God has accepted the offering that Christ presented to Him, not only the sacrifice for sin, which comes afterwards in chapter 4, etc.<a name=12:8></a>, but also the sweet savour of His life which was perfect.<a name=12:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ accepted the will of His Father in all its extent, going down, so to speak, from humiliation to humiliation, going on from obedience to obedience, always perfect but perfect as He grew up a man.<a name=12:10></a> He advanced in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and men (Luke 2); not that His obedience was ever less than perfection, but that it became ever more painful and difficult, till it went even up to death -- death of the cross.<a name=12:11></a> The world rejected Him always more and more.<a name=12:12></a> There was found in the world only a sepulchre for Him.<a name=12:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ perfectly glorified His Father.<a name=12:14></a> He rendered testimony to the holiness of His will by accepting it altogether.<a name=12:15></a> We on the contrary seek but too often to exalt ourselves even among our brethren; we want their esteem and their respect.<a name=12:16></a> Christ sought but "one thing," the glory of His Father, and not His own.<a name=12:17></a> For it, and so for us, He always went lower and lower down in this world.<a name=12:18></a> Wherefore also God highly exalted Him.<a name=12:19></a> He is accepted fully and on high; and if God is satisfied with Christ, we also ought surely to be satisfied with Him.<a name=12:20></a> We can find all repose for our hearts in Christ.<a name=12:21></a> Are you tired of the world, weary of the desert of sin, of strife?<a name=12:22></a> Well then look to Christ, where only is rest, perfect rest for conscience and heart.<a name=12:23></a> He is the sacrifice and the offering of good savour.<a name=12:24></a>

		Christ was perfectly holy, though He took part in blood and flesh, as the children had their common lot in the same, and was tempted in all things (sin excepted) in like manner with us.<a name=13:1></a> He fulfilled all righteousness; Matthew 3.<a name=13:2></a> He was Himself baptised, when the penitents flocked to John confessing their sins.<a name=13:3></a> If He thus put Himself on a level with the Baptist ("thus it becometh <i>us</i>," etc.<a name=13:4></a>), He puts Himself also on a level with Peter (Matthew 17) when the temple tribute was demanded, whilst displaying His divine wisdom and power in making the most unruly and inaccessible of creatures serve His good pleasure.<a name=13:5></a>

		But it was not allowed to burn cakes which contained leaven or honey; Leviticus 2: 11.<a name=13:6></a> Oil was there, the Spirit of God; and also the salt of His covenant; but leaven represented the sin we have in us which gives its character to our bodies as they are; and God could not accept it as being corrupt.<a name=13:7></a> Neither could honey any more be offered, representing the sweetness of nature which God gives to us by the way, in which our hearts can find some refreshment.<a name=13:8></a> So literally did it happen to Jonathan when faint; 1 Samuel 14.<a name=13:9></a> All that man has at his disposal is spoilt and cannot be offered to God; nothing can but the life of Christ as the meat-offering, and His death as the burnt-sacrifice, to say nothing here of His suffering for our sins and trespasses.<a name=13:10></a> In His perfection throughout God the Father finds His pleasure.<a name=13:11></a> Christ is all and in all.<a name=13:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As a new creation in Christ we are called to manifest what God is, not in miraculous power, but in doing and suffering all the will of the Father, owning and proclaiming it as alone good in obedience.<a name=13:13></a> It is only Christ who has thus absolutely glorified the Father.<a name=13:14></a> Even when He poured forth His deepest expressions of grief such as He alone knew, not a murmur escaped Him.<a name=13:15></a> Yea, when forsaken of His God and acknowledging it, He adds, "But thou continuest holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel," Psalm 22.<a name=13:16></a> Job on the other hand, though he had not his equal on the earth, could only say, "Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived .<a name=13:17></a>.<a name=13:18></a>.<a name=13:19></a> .<a name=13:20></a> Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life to the bitter in soul, which long for death, and it cometh not," etc.<a name=13:21></a> Such on the one hand was a perfect and an upright man; not such on the other was Christ.<a name=13:22></a> In all things He has the pre-eminence.<a name=13:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This and Psalm 16 give us two great principles of divine life -- trust and conscious righteousness.<a name=28:1></a> We find them running all through the Psalms, and any godly person's life as well as that of the Jew.<a name=28:2></a> But it is worthy of remark that it does not give the foundation fully on which we stand; according to the New Testament our position is different.<a name=28:3></a> You do not find in it the foundation of God's righteousness at this time.<a name=28:4></a> Souls in the condition of having divine life, but not knowing their standing in divine righteousness, find the suitability of the Psalms to their experience.<a name=28:5></a> Psalm 16 is the first that brings in Christ's own experience: for the first time here He takes His place in humiliation amongst them.<a name=28:6></a> Psalms 2 and 8 are prophetic of Him as King and as Son of man.<a name=28:7></a> In Psalm 16 He is taking His own place amongst these excellent of the earth.<a name=28:8></a> The first characteristic of the divine life is Christ putting His trust in Jehovah; as a man He does it.<a name=28:9></a> Hence in Luke, where we see Him more as a man, we see Him praying, the true expression of dependence.<a name=28:10></a> "Preserve me, O God," etc.<a name=28:11></a>; there is the principle of trust.<a name=28:12></a>

		Then another principle of divine life is the consciousness of integrity.<a name=28:13></a> In Peter there was the same when he said, "Lord, thou knowest all things, thou knowest that I love thee" There may be both these things -- trust in God and consciousness of integrity -- without peace with God.<a name=28:14></a> Job said, "Though he slay me, yet will I trust him"; and he pleaded his own righteousness against God -- "Till I die, I will not remove mine integrity from me.<a name=28:15></a>" He had the consciousness of sin and the sense of righteousness, integrity in himself, at the same time.<a name=28:16></a> The soul cannot be at peace in this state.<a name=28:17></a> Job was entirely wrong in making a righteousness of his integrity; his friends thought him a hypocrite, but he had the distinct consciousness of not being one.<a name=28:18></a> The second principle you have in Psalm 17.<a name=28:19></a> God stays up the souls that are trusting in Him until they see Christ.<a name=28:20></a> Having got a promise they trust, but cannot say, I have the righteousness of God.<a name=28:21></a> Christ having taken up their condition and borne it, they have the consciousness of integrity through Him, and it is the stay of their souls, but not peace.<a name=28:22></a>

		There is another thing in the Psalms -- mercy always going before righteousness; and they never meet till Christ appears at the end to the remnant.<a name=29:7></a> I cannot say righteousness and peace have kissed each other until I know the perfectness of redemption.<a name=29:8></a> I may get hope, but I cannot have peace until I get righteousness.<a name=29:9></a> It may be said, "Righteousness and peace have kissed," etc.<a name=29:10></a>, when Christ comes again (this for the Jew).<a name=29:11></a> A Jew under law would put righteousness before mercy; this is the law, and Israel never stood on that ground.<a name=29:12></a> They had made the golden calf before the law was given to them.<a name=29:13></a> Then God retires into His own sovereignty, and, to spare any, mercy comes in.<a name=29:14></a> It was the resource of God when wickedness came in.<a name=29:15></a> They were going about to establish their own righteousness and would not have Christ, who is the end of the law for righteousness; but when they come back, it will be on the ground of mercy and hope.<a name=29:16></a> How many Christians are on this ground instead of in the certainty of possessing righteousness!<a name=29:17></a> It is mercy and hope, instead of righteousness the ground of hope.<a name=29:18></a> They think of the throne of mercy, and promises coming out to help them, not being founded on righteousness.<a name=29:19></a> Of course they could not be saved without it; but the state of their souls is that they have not got into it.<a name=29:20></a>

		In Psalm 1 (which, with the second, is a sort of preface to the book), it is the distinction between the godly and ungodly man.<a name=38:5></a> The godly are called the righteous, and the ungodly are always called enemies.<a name=38:6></a> That the Lord should not spare any wicked transgressors is not the grace of the gospel.<a name=38:7></a> There are many passages where there is the call for judgment, because there must be the destruction of the enemy to allow of the deliverance of the Jewish remnant who seek rest on the earth.<a name=38:8></a> We could not consistently use this language, just as it is in itself, and say, "spare not any transgressor.<a name=38:9></a>" Having received grace we cry, "Spare them, pity them, save them, O Lord.<a name=38:10></a>" But judgment will be executed another day -- when the church is out of, and the Jews are in, the scene.<a name=38:11></a> If they have taken the place of adversary against the Lord, then it must be judgment.<a name=38:12></a> When the patience of God has been fully exercised, and the continuance of mercy would only be to sanction and perpetuate iniquity in the earth, "the master will rise up and shut to the door.<a name=38:13></a>" Then will be a time, not of grace as now, but of judgment.<a name=38:14></a> And then it will be seasonable.<a name=38:15></a> The Holy Spirit will warrant their looking for the deliverance which will cut off the enemies.<a name=38:16></a> The distinction in Psalm 1, and so throughout the whole book, is between the righteous and the wicked.<a name=38:17></a> "Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly," etc.<a name=38:18></a> "The ungodly are not so," etc.<a name=38:19></a> "Therefore the ungodly shall not stand," etc.<a name=38:20></a>

		In Psalm 2 the heathen are raging, the kings or rulers of the earth set themselves against Jehovah and His Christ.<a name=38:21></a> But God asserts and will enforce the rights of His Son on earth.<a name=38:22></a> Wherever the Spirit of God is working, there is the cry of the Spirit in the soul which must meet an answer.<a name=38:23></a> Now is a day of unmingled grace; but here the Spirit of Christ speaks of them as enemies, and is looking forward, as the only remedy, to their being cut off in judgment, unless they bow.<a name=38:24></a> Christ Himself is interested in this remnant, and is brought in as bearing their burdens.<a name=38:25></a> "They parted my garments among them" is a direct prophecy about the Lord.<a name=38:26></a> He joins Himself with their sighs.<a name=38:27></a> He has been with them for their sins, and He will deliver them from their foes.<a name=38:28></a> The tone and character of this book gives us the expectant blessings to Israel in letter: the spirit of it we take to our soul's comfort.<a name=38:29></a> I find in my soul certain anxiety and distress -- no doubt very imperfectly expressed -- but it is more or less the same in us as in the remnant; I look up to the Lord, but it may be my own fault brought me into the trouble, and I do not know what to say: then the Spirit gives me in the Psalms an inspired feeling of what is right under such circumstances.<a name=38:30></a> Thus I hear God's expression of my sorrow.<a name=38:31></a> It is a great comfort to the soul, but it must be understood how far they apply.<a name=38:32></a> Then again there is sin or Satan.<a name=38:33></a> In either case it is wrath against sin which is the source of wrath on our departure from God.<a name=38:34></a> Here is the power of Satan and the wrath of God.<a name=38:35></a> Christ had to come under the power of death, and therefore He had to come under the sin, I do not say morally, but substitutionally, as bearing the whole burden of our sin; to deliver us He must take it on Himself.<a name=38:36></a> He had to drink up the cup of wrath for us -- whether for Israel for earthly blessing, or for Christians for heavenly blessing.<a name=38:37></a> It is important to see the special bearing.<a name=38:38></a> Yet there are certain principles, immutable and that always apply, eternal truths that never vary -- whether earthly people or heavenly people are concerned.<a name=38:39></a> Only Christ can put us into blessing.<a name=38:40></a> The displayed ways may change, but the fundamental principle must always be the same.<a name=38:41></a> Sin is at bottom the same, and love is the same too; though the development of both may not be so.<a name=38:42></a>

		The word of God presents to us this very precious fact, that we do not only find there certain truths and doctrines, but also every relation between God and man fully developed on earth, and each day we can clearly see all these things in the Person of Jesus.<a name=52:1></a> It is a great mercy of God to have brought Him so near to us, as so to make known to us those relationships in the circumstances in which we are ourselves found.<a name=52:2></a> At bottom the life of Jesus was like ours.<a name=52:3></a> He was in all things tempted in like manner as ourselves.<a name=52:4></a> It was indeed God manifested in flesh; but it was also life, and the expression of a life; perfectly acceptable to God.<a name=52:5></a>

		It is always well to bear in mind that, in the former dispensation, God hid Himself, but that He sent certain messengers who were to reveal what was entrusted to them, but without making God known.<a name=53:7></a> The law did not manifest Him fully.<a name=53:8></a> It is true it says, Thou shalt love; but not, I love thee; it does not reveal a God of love.<a name=53:9></a> It does not shew us what God is, save that He is a just God and executes vengeance.<a name=53:10></a> It tells us nothing at all of what God is for man, nor of what He is in Himself.<a name=53:11></a> The law did indeed make known to men what they ought to be toward God, but it was silent as to what God is for them.<a name=53:12></a>

		The object of God is not only to cause sin to be felt, although that must take place, but to make Jesus known and to place the soul in the enjoyment of God Himself -- to act in grace towards it in order that it may forget itself and be filled with the thought of Jesus.<a name=56:20></a> This is the way God does it.<a name=56:21></a> He presents the Lord "as a root out of a dry ground.<a name=56:22></a>" There is in Him no beauty for man, as there was in the temple; nay, nothing of that which attracts the flesh and might tempt it -- nothing of all that.<a name=56:23></a> It is on the contrary, a root that none "should desire.<a name=56:24></a>" To the eyes of flesh there is absolutely nothing to render Him lovely.<a name=56:25></a> Who is it then?<a name=56:26></a> It is a poor man who goes preaching!<a name=56:27></a> He "hath not where to lay his head.<a name=56:28></a>" He is a man condemned by every clerical authority, by all the wise men and all the Pharisees.<a name=56:29></a> The Sadducees condemn Him, the priests condemn Him.<a name=56:30></a> Thus was Jesus received.<a name=56:31></a> In Him is "no beauty that we should desire him.<a name=56:32></a>" It was needful He should present Himself thus, that it might be shewn if the heart could discern God, and because He would not supply food to fleshly feeling.<a name=56:33></a> He must put the heart to the test, to prove whether God is enough for the heart, and whether the moral beauty that is in God -- His love, His holiness, His word that penetrates within the heart; whether, in a word, all that is infinitely precious in the divine nature -- can be discerned by man.<a name=56:34></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such is the position Jesus takes.<a name=60:14></a> He manifests His grace in testimony to man when he is in his sins.<a name=60:15></a> He adapts Himself to the circumstances of the sinner in his lowest state; He identifies Himself with him in the first step he takes under grace, but at the same time we see as to Himself that there is a voice "saying, This is my beloved Son.<a name=60:16></a>" This is the perfect Man in the presence of God -- the friend of poor sinners, and the expression of all that God loves to see in man in the midst of the world.<a name=60:17></a>

		But further (Matthew 4), if we are the children of God, His beloved children, as we believe, loved as Jesus is loved (as He said Himself: "That the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them"), we are through grace in the same position as Himself in the sight of God.<a name=60:18></a> But it is needful that this perfectly beloved Person should be tested, and we, not merely to know if we are children of God, nor as sinners; as such, we have already been tested, and we know we are lost.<a name=60:19></a> It is needful that grace should work; and when it is a question of grace, it is always the perfect grace of God toward sinners.<a name=60:20></a> All that is good must be on God's side, for in man there is nothing.<a name=60:21></a> The light manifests that in God there is nothing but that which is good, and in us no good thing.<a name=60:22></a> This love of God, in us, produces a new life.<a name=60:23></a> We are in the position of children of God, like Jesus; but then, the Spirit of God being in us, we must be put to the test.<a name=60:24></a> There are many things which hinder us from enjoying the love of God.<a name=60:25></a> There is selfishness, self-love, levity: therefore we must be put to the test, as Jesus Himself was.<a name=60:26></a> Paul says, "We glory in tribulations also .<a name=60:27></a>.<a name=60:28></a>.<a name=60:29></a> and hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts.<a name=60:30></a>"

		The true affection of Martha and Mary leads them to beg of Jesus to come, saying to Him, "He whom thou lovest is sick.<a name=62:14></a>" This appeal was very touching; but the Lord does not respond to it immediately: He had received nothing from God, and He does not go.<a name=62:15></a> He does not listen to His natural affections.<a name=62:16></a> He had indeed healed others that were sick; but if He had healed Lazarus, Martha and Mary would have learnt nothing more.<a name=62:17></a> Jesus then suffers Lazarus to die, and allows their heart to feel all the bitterness of death, that they may learn that the resurrection and the life are there.<a name=62:18></a>

		But this perfect submission of the Son gave rest, and brought His Person out to light.<a name=65:12></a> If He was thrown entirely on the Father, it was because He was Son, and because of His entire rejection in that character, in which, while perfect and shewing who He was, He had not taken His glory, and would have taken but the earthly dominion.<a name=65:13></a> The secret was that this was but "a light thing.<a name=65:14></a>" <i>All things</i> were delivered to Him of His Father, and by reason of the very glory of His Person, being Son of God, no man knew the Son but the Father His service now was to reveal the Father in the prerogative of grace.<a name=65:15></a> For none knew the Father save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal Him.<a name=65:16></a> "Come unto me," says this only patient witness of love -- "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.<a name=65:17></a>" Here I am, the rejected One, to whom in sure title all things are delivered of my Father; but One whose heart has bowed in all long-suffering of love, who has learnt submission, who has felt what it is to be pained and scorned and outwardly to find no refuge but submission.<a name=65:18></a> Come to Me.<a name=65:19></a> Men may have rejected Me, but I am the Son, and none knows the Father but as I reveal Him.<a name=65:20></a> Whosoever is burdened and passes not on with this haughty world, whosoever labours and is heavy-laden, here I exercise My love.<a name=65:21></a> "Come to me, and I will give you rest.<a name=65:22></a>" I have learnt how to speak a word in season to him that is weary.<a name=65:23></a> (Compare Isaiah 50 and the end of Romans 8, with its full extent of blessing to us.<a name=65:24></a>)

		I feel some difficulty in speaking of the subject before us here, not as to the doctrine itself but simply for the excellency of it; for where Christ is presented in His own perfectness all our thoughts are so inadequate.<a name=68:1></a> The excellency of the Lord so surpasses all our thoughts.<a name=68:2></a> He is sufficient to be the Father's delight: surely He ought to be ours.<a name=68:3></a> But it is of importance that our hearts should be occupied with Him, and this in His low estate.<a name=68:4></a> He is at the right hand of God now: we should look at Him in glory that we may be changed into the same image; but when we look to be the same mind as Christ, we must look at Him down here.<a name=68:5></a> Thus in Philippians 2, "let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus" -- when was that?<a name=68:6></a> When He who being in the.<a name=68:7></a> form of God in all the glory up there thought it not robbery to be equal with God, made Himself of no reputation and took upon Him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men; then when He was a man, found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.<a name=68:8></a> There are the two steps as it were as He is descending: first, when being in the form of God He came down to be a man; and then when He who so humbled Himself became obedient unto the death of the cross.<a name=68:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is the way in which He came from the actual glory of God -- came down: nothing stopped Him even then.<a name=68:10></a> But here He is before men.<a name=68:11></a> Putting away sin He was alone with God.<a name=68:12></a> It was all darkness: man had done his worst, and Satan.<a name=68:13></a> It was what the twenty-second Psalm brings before us when He speaks of the bulls of Bashan (verse 11-18).<a name=68:14></a> "But be not thou far from me" -- it was an appeal to God in what I may call human trials; He was cast into that -- all this wickedness; His rejection in His perfectness cast Him upon God; and then to find He was forsaken of God!<a name=68:15></a> There we get the efficacy of the sacrifice in putting away sin.<a name=68:16></a> But it is the traits of Christ's character in the path I desire to speak of.<a name=68:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we come to the cross, we must come by our wants and sins; no one comes truly, unless he comes as a sinner whose sins brought him there.<a name=68:18></a> But when we pass through the rent veil into the presence of God in perfect peace through the efficacy of the work He accomplished, and look back at the cross by which we came, in contemplating it in a divine way we find that the cross then has in it a glory and excellency all its own, of which everything in God's ways is the result -- even the new heavens and the new earth.<a name=68:19></a> God was perfectly glorified in it.<a name=68:20></a> It was the climax of good and evil: all was met there.<a name=68:21></a> We must come to the cross as sinners to find the good of it; but if we have found peace by it, coming into God's presence reconciled, it is everything we shall see for ever.<a name=68:22></a> We never shall forget the Lamb that was slain.<a name=68:23></a> But still we can contemplate it in a divine way.<a name=68:24></a>

		I get in the cross the perfectness of man's sin, positive enmity against God present in goodness.<a name=69:1></a> Nothing would do for man but to get rid of Him -- "Him ye have taken and by wicked hands have crucified and slain.<a name=69:2></a>" "If I had not come and done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin," then they would have been justified in rejecting Him, "but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.<a name=69:3></a>" There I get the extreme of man's wickedness: when God was presented in goodness, it only drew out his hatred.<a name=69:4></a> The power was present in Christ to meet all the effects of sin by His word: the manifestation of it drew out the enmity of man's heart against Him, and they crucified Him.<a name=69:5></a> There you get all that man is brought out in the presence of God.<a name=69:6></a> He had broken the law before; and now God had come in in perfect goodness and power (power that could remove all their distresses), but it was God's power; and they would not have it, they crucified Him.<a name=69:7></a> On the other hand we see there all the power of Satan: therefore it says, "Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the prince of this world be cast out": they were all led by him against Christ: "this is your hour and the power of darkness.<a name=69:8></a>" He had overcome him in the temptation in the wilderness; it is said in Luke he departed from Him for a season.<a name=69:9></a> Now He says, "The prince of this world cometh and hath nothing in me": he who had power over the earth (for Satan was really the prince of this world) had come back and succeeded in moving up the hatred of man's heart against Him.<a name=69:10></a>

		But now see the absolute perfectness of the second Man -- "But that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father gave me commandment, so I do.<a name=69:11></a>" I get in man (more than man) perfect love to the Father and perfect obedience, and when He had the dreadful cup to drink (mark the absolute need there was of it!<a name=69:12></a>) that perfect obedience and love to the Father made good in the very place where He stood as sin.<a name=69:13></a> On the other hand in the cross I find God's infinite love and grace abounding over sin: perfect love, giving His Son for us; and then at the same time perfect righteousness judging against sin, and God's majesty vindicated.<a name=69:14></a> "It became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.<a name=69:15></a>" I see thus perfect evil in man and Satan, perfect good in man (but He was God), and perfect love in God, and righteousness in God against sin when it was met as such, all brought out in the cross; evil and good meeting there.<a name=69:16></a> And it is what has laid the immutable foundation in righteousness for all that will come in in goodness and blessing in the new heavens and new earth, resting not upon responsibility but upon the accomplishment of the work the value of which never can be known.<a name=69:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The more we think of the cross (we have come as sinners needing it, but as Christians, reconciled to God, we can sit down and contemplate it), we see it stands totally alone in the history of eternity.<a name=69:18></a> Divine glory, man's sin, Man's perfectness, Satan's evil, God's power and love and righteousness, all were brought out and met there.<a name=69:19></a> Accordingly it is the immutable foundation of man's blessing, and of everything that is good in heaven and earth.<a name=69:20></a> Then, when our souls are reconciled, we look at Him and learn of Him: "Take my yoke upon you and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest.<a name=69:21></a>" He sees that the world had given Him up: there was no rest upon earth.<a name=69:22></a> He searched with wonderful patience for a place of rest, but there was no such thing to be found.<a name=69:23></a> He knew it, and had tried it; the Son of man had not where to lay (not merely outwardly) His head, but to rest His heart; no more than Noah's dove found rest for the sole of her feet.<a name=69:24></a> "I looked for some man to take compassion, but there was none.<a name=69:25></a>" Yet feeling this, it is just there He says, "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest: take my yoke," etc.<a name=69:26></a>, "and ye shall find rest unto your souls.<a name=69:27></a>"

		I desire then that, while we rest in the blessed efficacy of the sacrifice, our thoughts should be formed by the blessed One -- that is the practical secret of going through this world; "He that eateth me shall live by me.<a name=69:28></a>" No doubt the taste ought to grow continually in us.<a name=69:29></a> There are the two sides of Christian life; if it is to give courage, victory over the world, I look at His glory as in Philippians 3.<a name=69:30></a> There it is the energy that runs after to win Christ at the end, counting all else dross and dung.<a name=69:31></a> In the second chapter it is the other side, not the object, but His lowliness in coming down is set before us.<a name=69:32></a>

		I will now just look at the same scenes as they are presented in John and Luke.<a name=75:1></a> In John it is the other side of these truths; it is all through the divine side.<a name=75:2></a> When they come out to meet Him, He asks, "Whom seek ye?<a name=75:3></a>" and they went backward and fell to the ground.<a name=75:4></a> Looking at it as a Man, He had only to walk away.<a name=75:5></a> It is the divine side of power, while we see His absolute submission as man: "therefore doth my Father love me because I lay down my life that I might take it again.<a name=75:6></a> No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself; I have power to lay it down and power to take it again.<a name=75:7></a>" He says the second time, "Whom seek ye?<a name=75:8></a> And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.<a name=75:9></a> Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he; if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way.<a name=75:10></a>" He puts Himself freely forward, the divine Person giving Himself, and lets the disciples escape.<a name=75:11></a> There is no attachment to Himself manifest on their part; but He fills the gap, and they are safe.<a name=75:12></a> It is the same on the cross: there is no cry of "my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?<a name=75:13></a>" there; it is His divine perfectness above it all.<a name=75:14></a> "After this [having committed His mother to the disciple] Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.<a name=75:15></a>" Then He said, "It is finished, and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost.<a name=75:16></a>" When all that the Spirit of God had said would come was fulfilled and finished, He gave up His own spirit to His Father -- it is the divine side of it all you see in John.<a name=75:17></a>

		In Matthew we get the victim; He is the lamb going to the slaughter.<a name=76:1></a> But I must say a word on Luke.<a name=76:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Luke we get the perfect blessedness of the Lord and His sufferings in Gethsemane more fully than anywhere else, but on the cross not one expression of sorrow; He is fulfilling Scripture.<a name=76:3></a> Just as in John we have seen the divine side, here I find Him still more distinctly brought out as a Man.<a name=76:4></a> "Being in an agony," in deep affliction of soul, He is cast as man on His Father -- "he prayed more earnestly.<a name=76:5></a>" So great was His confidence, perfect in His agony.<a name=76:6></a> It is there we find "his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground," and an angel from heaven strengthening Him.<a name=76:7></a> So also in Luke you get Christ praying much more often than in the other Gospels, because the object is to present Him to us as Son of man.<a name=76:8></a> On the cross you do not get one expression of sorrow -- He had gone through it perfectly (I speak of the cup).<a name=76:9></a> "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?<a name=76:10></a>" is not in Luke.<a name=76:11></a> The sorrow was there, it is true, but it is not that side.<a name=76:12></a> We get then the perfectness of Jesus who had gone through it all with His Father in the garden.<a name=76:13></a> And so entirely is He above it that at the close occur the words, "Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said this he expired.<a name=76:14></a>" We have the blessed Lord thus presented in these various characters.<a name=76:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		John gives a divine Person: "as soon as he had said unto them, I am he, they went backward and fell to the ground"; He could have gone away, but it was not for that He had come: "If ye seek me, let these go their way.<a name=76:16></a>" You see divine power and the divine perfectness of love, not exercising the power, but putting Himself forward to stand in the gap that they might escape.<a name=76:17></a> And on the cross He gives up His own spirit.<a name=76:18></a> In Luke I find His own sorrow and suffering as man in Gethsemane, more than in the other Gospels: and on the cross above all the circumstances He commends His spirit to the Father.<a name=76:19></a> In Matthew He is the sheep going to the slaughter.<a name=76:20></a>

		The more we look to follow the blessed Lord in His path here, the more our hearts are bound in right affections to Him.<a name=76:21></a> He stood alone, ever as a man down here perfectly alone; and there is nothing more trying.<a name=76:22></a> "All ye shall be offended because of me this night.<a name=76:23></a>" Again He says, "Behold the hour cometh, yea is now come, that ye shall be scattered every man to his own and shall leave me alone, and yet I am not alone because the Father is with me" -- nobody else!<a name=76:24></a> He looked for compassion, and got none; for some to watch with Him, and they fell asleep: to stand by Him, and they all forsook Him and fled.<a name=76:25></a> He is betrayed with a kiss.<a name=76:26></a> He felt it all: it was not an enemy, but thou, a man, my companion; "yea mine own familiar friend in whom I trusted which did eat of my bread has lifted up his heel against me.<a name=76:27></a>" Follow Him all through: it puts down the pride of the heart; it sets us men very low, but it sets Him as man in a wonderful perfectness; not man in the glory, but a man going through everything that could test the heart in the purest possible way; a man tested in every possible way, bowing His head as a victim, feeling it so that His sweat was as it were great drops of blood, going through it all as man so that our hearts might follow Him -- going through every depth, and we poor creatures only standing by to look at Him.<a name=76:28></a> It is well if we are not asleep too!<a name=76:29></a> That is where it draws out the affections.<a name=76:30></a> It sifts the will.<a name=76:31></a> The will and affections never go together; will is self, affections rest necessarily in another.<a name=76:32></a> He is the perfect object -- "therefore doth my Father love me because I lay down my life that I might take it again.<a name=76:33></a>" To see Him in the meekness of His path giving Himself for us, never turning Himself aside, perfect in going through all, just as quiet with Him as if nothing had happened.<a name=76:34></a> He suffered it so with God.<a name=76:35></a> We want our hearts to get right; we want our wills to be broken down; if we go and look at Christ as thus presented to us in Gethsemane, can we seek to satisfy the will now?<a name=76:36></a><a name=77>[Page 77]</a>

		Thus I get what is outside myself as an object that sets my affections perfectly right, and that does not leave a possibility of my will working.<a name=77:1></a> Looking at One that is beyond me, I find One that does not leave the possibility of the working of my will, but that draws out the energy of the affections of my heart and sets my will aside.<a name=77:2></a> He could say, "Therefore doth my Father love me ": so blessed was it, so perfect was He in it, that it gave a cause to God to love Him.<a name=77:3></a> Only divine perfectness could give a cause for divine love.<a name=77:4></a> The heart knowing that He is now in glory gets filled.<a name=77:5></a> "I am the bread that came down from heaven," that we might abide in Him.<a name=77:6></a> "Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus.<a name=77:7></a>" We are to be like Him in this character -- He humbled Himself, He went always down till God took Him up.<a name=77:8></a> Are we content to follow Him?<a name=77:9></a> Looking at Him and seeing His perfectness, are we content to have all our affections filled with Christ, and no will at all?<a name=77:10></a> We are going to be with Him for ever; and we can enjoy what He is in heaven, in which His perfect blessedness is before our hearts and has been tested by us.<a name=77:11></a> How far have our hearts tasted of that bread, and how far are we kept, our wills subdued and occupied with Christ?<a name=77:12></a> It is what God the Father delights in.<a name=77:13></a> There is the efficacy of His work as the foundation; but how far is Christ Himself the object of our souls' delight, dwelling on Him so that they are kept awake?<a name=77:14></a> There is nothing that forms the heart, breaking down the will in us, like the delight that we have in Christ in fellowship with the Father.<a name=77:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is said that the Lord is the truth, "I am the way, the truth, and the life"; and He does bring out everything in a remarkable way.<a name=79:1></a> He shews out what God is in Himself, and what man is; and God's grace has come with Him: "grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.<a name=79:2></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this chapter we find truth first, truth as to man's condition; but there is also the grace of God's heart.<a name=79:3></a> It is a great thing to have the two together.<a name=79:4></a> If truth had come without grace, we could not have borne it a moment.<a name=79:5></a> Man is a sinner utterly unfit for heaven; but it is immense comfort that grace and truth have come together.<a name=79:6></a> God's two essential names are Love and Light.<a name=79:7></a> If we had not love with light, it would have condemned us; but we have perfect light in presence of perfect love.<a name=79:8></a> Our comfort is that light does come and reveal everything.<a name=79:9></a> Being in God's very nature, we cannot separate the two things, light and love.<a name=79:10></a> Just the same things appear in the details of the Christian's life.<a name=79:11></a>

		In many instances in Scripture we see how light penetrates: but there is an attractive power along with it.<a name=79:12></a> There is never real working in man's soul without attractive power.<a name=79:13></a> The Christian stands "accepted in the beloved"; but the light of God comes in on all his ways.<a name=79:14></a> Take the prodigal: the light shines in and shews that he is a lost sinner, but there is attractive power too.<a name=79:15></a> "I will arise and go to my father.<a name=79:16></a>" Take the woman that was a sinner.<a name=79:17></a> There was a sense of sinfulness because light comes in; but the measure in which light shone into her soul cannot be separated from the love that came with it.<a name=79:18></a> Take Peter, falling at Jesus' knees, and saying at the same time, "Depart from me.<a name=79:19></a>" Wherever the blessed God reveals Himself to our souls, nothing is left in the dark.<a name=79:20></a> If anything is not completely revealed it may come out in the day of judgment; but all is revealed.<a name=79:21></a> We have a perfect revelation of God as light and as love; and both are working in the soul.<a name=79:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Mark 14

	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two sides in the sufferings of the Lord Jesus; the sufferings which, during His career, He endured from men, and the sufferings which He knew when, taking the cup He had to drink, He bore the weight of the wrath of God.<a name=84:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The extent of man's iniquity appears in two ways; directly in all that man did in opposing and rejecting Jesus, but, above all, in the weight of sin the Lord Jesus had to bear when He drank the cup which the Father had given Him.<a name=84:2></a> For Him this was no light thing.<a name=84:3></a> He "began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy; and saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death" (verse 33).<a name=84:4></a>

		Among those who may read this, are there not several who have never been saddened because of their sins?<a name=84:5></a> Is there anything which more lays bare the folly and levity of the heart of man?<a name=84:6></a> We who by sin have made so bitter and awful the cup which Jesus drank, we may consider sin as trifling in the eyes of God!<a name=84:7></a> But it is He -- it is Jesus who found how horrible it was.<a name=84:8></a> If our hearts, miserable as they are, feel not sin, Christ felt it when He drank the cup for us and bore sin for us.<a name=84:9></a> If the heart does not understand the gravity of sin, not to the same point as Jesus knew it, but at least in some degree -- if, feeble as it may be, the feeling of the gravity of sin is a stranger to us -- we have not at all entered into the mind of Jesus.<a name=84:10></a>

		It is very different to have the heart touched by these things, or merely to have the knowledge of them; for it is not of this knowledge that I would speak here.<a name=84:11></a> To have the knowledge of the gravity of sin, of what sin cost Jesus, and not to have the heart touched by it, is even worse than to know nothing about it whatever.<a name=84:12></a> The state of the heart is, in one of these cases, even worse than in the other.<a name=84:13></a>

		THE WORD MADE FLESH
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		John 1:1-13
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is one remark that furnishes a most important key to the Gospel of John, which is illustrated very simply and manifestly in this first chapter.<a name=95:1></a> The object of the Holy Ghost is to assert the personal glory of Jesus; and hence it is that there is not perhaps a single chapter in the New Testament that presents our Lord in so many different aspects, yet all personal, as this opening chapter of his Gospel.<a name=95:2></a> His divine glory is carefully guarded.<a name=95:3></a> He is said in the most distinct language to be God as to His nature, but withal a man.<a name=95:4></a> He is God no less than the Father is, or the Holy Ghost; but He is the Word in a way in which the Father and the Holy Ghost were not.<a name=95:5></a> It was Jesus Christ the Son of God who alone was the Word of God.<a name=95:6></a> He only after a personal sort expressed God.<a name=95:7></a> The Father and the Holy Ghost remained in their own unseeable majesty.<a name=95:8></a> The Word had for His place to express God clearly; and this belonged to Him, it is evident, as a distinctive personal glory.<a name=95:9></a> It was not merely that He was the Word when He came into the world, but "in the beginning was the Word" when there was no creature.<a name=95:10></a> Before anything came into being that was made, the Word was in the beginning with God; not merely <i>in</i> God, as if merged or lost in God, but He had a distinct personal subsistence before a creature existed.<a name=95:11></a> He "was in the beginning with God.<a name=95:12></a>" This is of immense importance, and with these truths our Gospel opens.<a name=95:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then we find His creation glory stated afterwards.<a name=95:14></a> "All things were made by him.<a name=95:15></a>" There is nothing which more stamps God to be God than giving existence to that which had none, causing to exist by His own will and power.<a name=95:16></a> Now all things exist by the Word: and so emphatically true is this that the Spirit has added, "and without him was not anything made that was made.<a name=95:17></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there was that which belonged to the Lord Jesus that was not made: "In him was life.<a name=95:18></a>" It was not only that He could cause a life to exist that had not before existed, but there was a life that belonged to Him from all eternity.<a name=95:19></a> "In him was life.<a name=95:20></a>" Not that this life began to be: all else, all creation, began to be; and it was He that gave them the commencement of their existence.<a name=95:21></a> But in Him was life, a life that was not created, a life that was therefore divine in its nature.<a name=95:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=96>[Page 96]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was the reality and the manifestation of this life which were of prime importance to man.<a name=96:1></a> Everything else that had been since the beginning of the world was only a creature; but in Him was life.<a name=96:2></a> Man was destined to have the display of this life on earth.<a name=96:3></a> But it was in Him before He came among men.<a name=96:4></a> The life was not called the light of angels but of men.<a name=96:5></a> Nowhere do we find that eternal life is created.<a name=96:6></a> The angels are never said to have life in the Son of God.<a name=96:7></a> They were kept by divine power and holy.<a name=96:8></a> Theirs is a purely creature life, whereas it is a wonderful fact of revelation that we who believe have the eternal life that was in Jesus Christ the Son of God, and are therefore said to be partakers of the divine nature.<a name=96:9></a> This is in no way true of an angel.<a name=96:10></a> It is not that we for a moment cease to be creatures, but we have what is above the creature in Christ the Son of God.<a name=96:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And this "light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehendeth it not.<a name=96:12></a>" It is striking to remark here the entire passing over of all the history of the world of which we are apt to make so much, yea, even of the dispensational dealings of God with men.<a name=96:13></a> All is passed by very briefly indeed -- those ages that man thinks all but interminable, in which God gave being to the creature and in which He may have changed over and over again the various forms of the creature, where science is endeavouring to pursue its uncertain and weary way.<a name=96:14></a> All this is closed up in the few words, "All things were made by him.<a name=96:15></a>" Scripture, and this chapter in particular, summarises it with striking brevity.<a name=96:16></a> "All things were made by him.<a name=96:17></a>" The details of it were left completely aside.<a name=96:18></a> What was good for us to know we are told in Genesis 1.<a name=96:19></a> There is nothing like that chapter even in cosmogonies which borrowed from it.<a name=96:20></a> And all that man has thought or said or written about a system of the world is not to be named with it for depth or certainty, as well as for simplicity, in the smallest compass.<a name=96:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is a reason why all such matters vanish after two or three words.<a name=96:22></a> It is because the Lord Jesus, the Word of God, is the object that the Holy Ghost is dwelling on.<a name=96:23></a> The moment that He is brought out creation just pays Him homage, owning Him to be the Creator, and is then forthwith dismissed.<a name=96:24></a> "All things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made.<a name=96:25></a>" It is enough to say that He created all.<a name=96:26></a> He remains in His own grace.<a name=96:27></a> Now we learn what is the Spirit's object in this.<a name=96:28></a> It was not to give us details of the creation; it was to acquaint us with Jesus as the light of men.<a name=96:29></a>
	</div>

		<a name=97>[Page 97]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In what condition then did He find men?<a name=97:1></a> Were there not great differences among them, as was thought?<a name=97:2></a> There were some, most indeed, idolaters, yet wise and prudent, worshipping stocks and stones; and others who were not idolaters but very zealous for the law as given by Moses.<a name=97:3></a> Not that a word is said yet about the law, nor about any differences, but that the Word of God was the light that manifested everybody: whether Jews or Gentiles, they were only darkness.<a name=97:4></a> It is not therefore only that the physical creation is passed by most curtly, but the moral world is closed with almost equal brevity.<a name=97:5></a> "The light shineth in darkness," and whatever the boasting of the Gentiles, and the law of the Jews (which was real as compared with the Gentiles), here all is measured and put out, as it were, by the true light, the Word of God.<a name=97:6></a> Jew or Gentile, they are but darkness, and the light shines in darkness, and spite of all its pretension and pride, the darkness comprehended it not.<a name=97:7></a> "The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God.<a name=97:8></a>" When the Holy Ghost is come down, things are also tested and convicted by Him; and He is brought forward by Paul somewhat as John here introduces the Son of God.<a name=97:9></a> It shews how poor all of man is in comparison with God, and how little he is capable of appreciating the truth in the Son or by the Spirit.<a name=97:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then we find John brought in.<a name=97:11></a> The reason why he is singled out from all others I believe to be this: he was the immediate forerunner of the Lord Jesus.<a name=97:12></a> He would surely not have been named here if it were not, because he was the moon that derived its light from the sun -- from the Lord Jesus just about to come.<a name=97:13></a> His was only a derivative light, and he seems brought in here because of that peculiarity.<a name=97:14></a> Other prophets were too distant from Christ, but John was near enough to be an immediate precursor of the Messiah.<a name=97:15></a> "There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.<a name=97:16></a> The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the light, that all men through him might believe.<a name=97:17></a>" It is no question of law-testing or proving.<a name=97:18></a> All this was very important in its place; but the glory that the law had is completely eclipsed by a brighter glory.<a name=97:19></a> Scripture therefore takes pains to say, John "was not that light, but was sent to bear witness of that light.<a name=97:20></a>" He might be a burning and a shining lamp (as it ought to be in chapter 5), but he was only an earthly and derived light.<a name=97:21></a> "He was not that light.<a name=97:22></a>" "That was the true light"; Jesus is the light, the true light, which (as rightly rendered) on coming into the world lighteth every man.<a name=97:23></a> It is speaking of the effect of Christ's coming into the world.<a name=97:24></a> It is not every man that cometh into the world; but that, when He comes into the world, He is the One that casts His light on every one here below.<a name=97:25></a> There had been a time when, as it is said in the Acts, God winked at the ignorance of men; but now everything must appear in its own light or rather darkness, because the true light was come; and therefore when He comes into the world He lights every man there: all are brought out just as they are and none can escape.<a name=97:26></a> "He was in the world, and the world was made by him"; and the awful result of this darkness was that "the world knew him not.<a name=97:27></a> He came unto his own, and his own received him not.<a name=97:28></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		The world was guilty enough, it was so dark that it did not even know Him; the Jews had abundance of truth by which they might know Him, but their will was still more set against the Son of God than even the poor Gentiles.<a name=98:1></a> "His own received him not.<a name=98:2></a> But as many as received him, to them gave he power [title or right] to be children of God, even to them that believe on his name: which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.<a name=98:3></a>" What a blessed place!<a name=98:4></a> and blessed to know that this is our place to which grace has entitled us now in His name!<a name=98:5></a> May we seek to make Him known to every creature with all our hearts in the measure of power the Lord has given us, honouring thus, and in every other way, the Lord Jesus, whom the Holy Ghost loves to honour.<a name=98:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have other glories of His brought out afterwards.<a name=98:7></a> We hear of Him as the Son, the Lamb of God, the Baptiser with the Holy Ghost, the King of Israel, and the Son of man.<a name=98:8></a> All these are successively unfolded to us in this chapter.<a name=98:9></a> Indeed it would be difficult to say what glory of our Lord is not presented here except that of Priest and of Head of the church.<a name=98:10></a> John never gives us the priesthood of Jesus.<a name=98:11></a> He touches what is close on it, when He speaks in his first epistle of advocacy with the Father; but the business of John was to shew His divine personal glory, yet as man on earth.<a name=98:12></a> Priest was what He was called to be in heaven; and as Head of the church He is there also.<a name=98:13></a> But John shews us what He was in Himself as coming from heaven, and that He does not lose one whit of His glory by becoming a man.<a name=98:14></a> In His being Priest and Head of the church we see special glories which He received on going up to heaven, and these Paul develops fully.<a name=98:15></a> John's point is God and the Father manifested on earth in the Person of Jesus Christ His Son.<a name=98:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		John 1: 29-34
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This chapter is remarkable inasmuch as it brings before us the various titles or names of Christ, almost all that He is in His varied titles, unless indeed the relative ones.<a name=100:1></a> You do not see Him as Head of the church, nor as priest, nor Christ; but you get Him as only-begotten Son of God, who reveals the Father, Son of and King of Israel, the Lamb of God, Life, the Light, the Word, the Creator, the Son of man, the Baptiser with the Holy Ghost, all the names that tell what He is in His own Person.<a name=100:2></a> In an abstract way you have what His nature is, His personality, light, life: only that, when John brings in man's condition with the testimony to what man is as rejecting Christ, "The light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not.<a name=100:3></a>"

		The three other Gospels present Christ to man to be received, and close with His rejection, but this Gospel takes up His rejection from the very beginning, "He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not; he came to his own and his own received him not," and you then have what grace does and the objects of grace distinct.<a name=100:4></a> After the abstract statement of what He was comes the testimony, not of what Christ was, but what He became.<a name=100:5></a> "The Word became flesh and dwelt among us.<a name=100:6></a>" There His Person, as incarnate, is brought out, not what He was abstractedly but "became flesh.<a name=100:7></a>" Then, in the verses I read, you get His work.<a name=100:8></a> You have thus what He is essentially and in His nature, then what He became -- incarnation in a word, and also His revealing the Father -- "No man hath seen God at any time: the only-begotten Son which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him"; and also we receive of His fulness.<a name=100:9></a> He becomes the source, and He is the fulness of which we have all received; and then in the verses read we get the work of grace from the very starting-point of the Gospel.<a name=100:10></a>

		You get this work in two parts; it is the second I shall chiefly speak of; but the first is Christ as the Lamb of God, and then He is the Baptiser with the Holy Ghost.<a name=101:1></a> It is not that He does not exercise also His priesthood -- He does; but it is not the subject here.<a name=101:2></a> I guard this because it is important to remember that He is Priest.<a name=101:3></a> But here He is the Lamb of God, and He that baptiseth with the Holy Ghost.<a name=101:4></a>

		We had an innocent world, paradise: this was soon over; then a sinful world, though with grace working in it; but we shall have, not an innocent nor a sinful world, but a righteous world; and it will be founded on that which can never lose its value so that itself never can be touched.<a name=101:13></a> It is the immutable basis of God's new creation, which is therefore immutable in its blessings where all His ways are manifested.<a name=101:14></a> That will be the full result of the work of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=101:15></a> The first world was set in blessing, but it depended on the faithfulness of Him who was placed at the head of it; the final one rests secure on the value of that which is perfected, coming after a work finished and done, a work in which God has perfectly glorified Himself.<a name=101:16></a> The basis of the new creation on which it is founded is finished, finished completely and absolutely.<a name=101:17></a>

		But then I get a second thing, which is that in order to do all this He became a man, and, consequent upon His going up to God, risen from the dead, the Holy Ghost is now come down.<a name=103:14></a> The presence of the Holy Ghost on earth is consequent upon Christ's exaltation to the right hand of God.<a name=103:15></a> His presence here is that which puts a man down here who has the Holy Ghost into association and relation with Christ in heaven.<a name=103:16></a> And so, further, you get the great truth that God now dwells down here on earth.<a name=103:17></a> And this is an immense truth; it never was the case before redemption.<a name=103:18></a> God never dwelt with Adam though He came down to visit him innocent, nor with Abraham.<a name=103:19></a> But the moment that Israel was redeemed out of Egypt, He says, in Exodus 29: 45, 46, "And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God, and they shall know that I am Jehovah their God, that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them.<a name=103:20></a>" And all this was written for our admonition, and God shewed Himself in the shekinah glory of the tabernacle dwelling between the cherubim upon the mercy-seat.<a name=103:21></a>

		Now, however, it is the Holy Ghost who is come down, and who dwells either in the individual believer or in the assembly of God, the temple of the living God; and the consequence of this to me is that I have the knowledge of the whole value of the work that is done, and I have got, through the Holy Ghost here, complete and entire association with Christ where He is, and I rejoice in hope of the glory of God.<a name=104:1></a> Until that comes, God dwells already in those who believe in Christ.<a name=104:2></a> Mark how it comes in; He was anointed with the Holy Ghost; "And I knew him not, but he that sent me to baptise with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and remaining on Him, the same is he which baptiseth with the Holy Ghost.<a name=104:3></a>" Before I get the baptising (Christ is not said to be baptised but anointed and sealed) on the day of Pentecost, Christ had been anointed and sealed.<a name=104:4></a> He had taken this place as a man, as the pattern of it all; as Son, as a man here, the place into which He introduces us by redemption, the relationship in which He is with the Father and into which He introduces us.<a name=104:5></a>

		I speak of the thing in itself, not of the accomplishment of the results, for the present effect was not peace but division; but, when His people take the first step in the right path in obedience to the word, He falls in with them, they indeed confessing sin, He fulfilling righteousness.<a name=105:1></a> And thus, at His baptism I get the blessed Lord, coming as a man, as He did publicly then, in full obedience, entering by the door; and He then receives the Holy Ghost, who comes down on Him as such.<a name=105:2></a> And how could He receive the Holy Ghost?<a name=105:3></a> Because He was righteous in Himself, and we through His work.<a name=105:4></a> He was both anointed and sealed, and thus we find Him attributing His works to the Spirit: "If I by the Spirit of God cast out devils.<a name=105:5></a>" It is remarkable how the Trinity is brought before us in this.<a name=105:6></a> The Son wrought on earth, cast out demons by the Spirit, and the Father that dwelt in Him, He did the works.<a name=105:7></a> His work shewed how the Trinity is brought out in specific connection with that purpose in man, through which the Son became man.<a name=105:8></a> It is first fully revealed in the passage in Matthew 3.<a name=105:9></a> Christ the Son was there, the Spirit descended upon Him, and the Father owns Him, a man on the earth, as Son.<a name=105:10></a> So through the eternal Spirit He offered Himself without spot to God.<a name=105:11></a> God anointed Jesus of Nazareth, says Peter, with the Holy Ghost and with power.<a name=105:12></a>

		Thus it is we get the double character of Christ manifested down here: God in grace towards us; and man made sin before God, but as putting it away for us by His work in drinking the cup His Father had given Him to drink; and, mark, the only part that we have in that work is the sins that put Him to death; and the hatred that did it, when He gave Himself up to it in love.<a name=108:1></a> But this is all finished; and when Christ had by Himself purged our sins, He sat down at the right hand of the majesty on high; and thereupon not only is it the fact that the Holy Ghost comes down, but Christ receives it again, "being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this which ye now see and hear.<a name=108:2></a>" And I find this, that in virtue of that work of putting away my sins, and having cleansed me and washed me and justified me and redeemed me to God, the Holy Ghost also is given that I may go and understand and enjoy all that Christ is, all that Christ has done, and that He has made my portion in consequence.<a name=108:3></a> True, I am here in weakness, a poor earthen vessel that the excellency of the power may be of God; all quite true.<a name=108:4></a> But I have the relationship.<a name=108:5></a> I am a child, I want to be taught by my Father; and alas!<a name=108:6></a> it may be sometimes a naughty child and I want to be whipped by my Father, but I am a child, a partaker of the divine nature.<a name=108:7></a>

		A man must be born again -- born of water and of the Spirit, if he has to say to God.<a name=131:4></a> This is what has to be presented to the sinner: "Ye <i>must</i> be born again"; while at the same time we know it must be God's work.<a name=131:5></a> Not that it is said in a legal sense, "<i>Ye must</i>," etc.<a name=131:6></a>, because we know a man cannot accomplish it of himself.<a name=131:7></a> But there is a moral necessity for it, because, until born again, the sinner cannot have one desire or anything in him suited to God.<a name=131:8></a> It is the requisite flowing from what God is, and what the sinner is.<a name=131:9></a> But there is no such necessity for the indwelling of the Spirit in the believer.<a name=131:10></a> Instead of being requirement, it is the expression of pure grace; not so much necessary to man, as it is given by God.<a name=131:11></a>

		This chapter is an answer to the distress of the hearts of the disciples, and in it we get two things set before them: first, the glory of Christ's Person with His coming again; and, secondly, the coming of the Comforter.<a name=151:1></a>

		The first great truth that He brings out is that they belong entirely to another place.<a name=151:2></a> This world is not good enough for them.<a name=151:3></a> He was going away from them, and this was something to trouble their hearts.<a name=151:4></a> Therefore He brings before them Himself, as the object of comfort, "Ye believe in God, believe also in me.<a name=151:5></a>" By believing in God, you get comfort; so it will be by believing in Me.<a name=151:6></a>

		The great broad principle set forth in answer to this is comprehended in what He is.<a name=151:10></a> And it is as though He said, Do not suppose I am going away to be alone in heaven.<a name=151:11></a> No, it is for you I am going.<a name=151:12></a> "In my Father's house are many mansions.<a name=151:13></a> I go to prepare a place for you.<a name=151:14></a>" There is "room enough and to spare.<a name=151:15></a>" This was another thing to comfort them -- a place in the Father's house.<a name=151:16></a> The home of the Christian is there where Christ is.<a name=151:17></a> He was not going for Himself only, just to relieve Himself from the desolateness of the world.<a name=151:18></a> He was going to His home as the Firstborn among many brethren, and all the rest will have their place there too at His coming.<a name=151:19></a> "And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto myself.<a name=151:20></a>" This is the language of affection.<a name=151:21></a> He does not say, I will send for you.<a name=151:22></a> No, that would not satisfy the heart -- "I will come.<a name=151:23></a>" He would not be content without having them where He is, and without coming to fetch them.<a name=151:24></a> He could not leave them down here in this polluted world.<a name=151:25></a> "Where I am, there shall my servant be.<a name=151:26></a>" And there will be the word for them, "Well done, good and faithful servant, enter," etc.<a name=151:27></a> He takes their hearts out of this world altogether -- not their persons yet indeed, for they were to be left without Him for a season.<a name=151:28></a>

		The Gospel of John brings out specially that which refers to the Person of Christ in contrast to all that is Jewish.<a name=155:1></a> At the beginning of it we see Him presenting Himself in divine right and power to "his own," while "his own received him not"; and towards the close we see Him leaving those who had thus rejected Him, and the Comforter coming to take His place -- to take of the things of Christ, and testify of Him to the world, and to be the guide and support of those whom He was leaving behind.<a name=155:2></a> In this chapter we see the twofold character of the work of the Holy Ghost: His way with the world, and His way towards the saints.<a name=155:3></a>

		Verse 2.<a name=155:4></a> The first thing the Lord shews the disciples here is, that they are to have the same position as their Master: opposition and rejection.<a name=155:5></a> The opposition of the world often comes from entire blindness.<a name=155:6></a> "Whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.<a name=155:7></a>" Such is the blinding power of unbelief!<a name=155:8></a> It was so with Saul.<a name=155:9></a> He thought he "ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth," Acts 26: 9.<a name=155:10></a> Man walks in darkness, because he is darkness, his conscience is darkness, and in consequence of false instruction his mind is blinded too.<a name=155:11></a> What a man does conscientiously, he always does with earnestness, though he may be acting wrongly with a blinded conscience.<a name=155:12></a> A person may be very conscientious in resisting the truth.<a name=155:13></a> What is called conscientious acting is often nothing in the sight of God but the conduct of one who is thoroughly blinded by Satan.<a name=155:14></a>

		Verse 3.<a name=155:15></a> "These things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.<a name=155:16></a>" God had given them every evidence of who Christ was, but, in spite of all that God could give, they rejected Him.<a name=155:17></a> "This is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness .<a name=155:18></a>.<a name=155:19></a>.<a name=155:20></a> .<a name=155:21></a>"

		What a wonderful blessing the presence of the Holy Ghost must be, when it needed that the Lord Jesus Christ should go away in order that He might come!<a name=156:22></a> It is well for us to ask ourselves whether we do really believe in the personal presence of the Holy Ghost down here.<a name=156:23></a> A soul might say, "Ah, if I had the Lord here to direct me, how well should I do and bear!<a name=156:24></a> "But if we know redemption-deliverance through the death and resurrection of Christ, we have Him still with us, and in the best and nearest way.<a name=156:25></a> For the Holy Ghost dwells in us to unfold Him to our souls, to teach us the glory of Him who has loved us and shed His blood for us, who has all power, Head over the Jews, Head of the Gentiles, Lord over everything.<a name=156:26></a> Nor is it only the glory of His Person, but our union we learn.<a name=156:27></a> "At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.<a name=156:28></a>" We have the Holy Ghost too as the guide; and the Lord would have us guided not ignorantly but in intelligence.<a name=156:29></a> The presence of the Holy Ghost presupposes judgment having passed upon the flesh, which naturally resists guidance, and the flesh must not be allowed place in the Christian, if he would be guided of the Spirit.<a name=156:30></a>

		It is very natural that Jesus should have deeply felt, before leaving this world, all the circumstances in which His disciples were about to find themselves.<a name=161:1></a> At the moment when the Son had accomplished His work, and completely glorified the Father in the midst of all the difficulties and all the malice of Satan (a moment which has not had, and which will not have, its equal, whether in time or in eternity), it was natural, I say, that He should put all before the Father.<a name=161:2></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He said these things in the world, where He had been the Man of sorrows, and where He had suffered much.<a name=161:6></a> In virtue of the work He accomplished, He can enjoy all the privileges of His work; but He takes this into consideration, that His disciples are left in the world.<a name=161:7></a>

		JESUS THE WILLING CAPTIVE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		John 18: 1-10
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Two points attract and fill our hearts in this passage.<a name=170:1></a> First, the perfect willingness with which Christ gives Himself up, the unhesitating way in which He presents Himself to the armed band come out to seek Him, fully knowing what was to befall Him.<a name=170:2></a> "Jesus, therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, I have told you that I am he.<a name=170:3></a> If, therefore, ye seek me, let these go their way," proving that, while He offers Himself, there is a full and perfect deliverance for us.<a name=170:4></a> "Of them which thou gavest me, I have lost none.<a name=170:5></a>" The Lord presents Himself, that none of us might even be touched with the power of the enemy.<a name=170:6></a> It was the same self-devotion on the cross; though here it was the power of Satan, but He had gone through it.<a name=170:7></a> When led into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil, He bound the strong man, and introduced present blessing into the world; but we as men were unable to profit by this, because of a moral inward incapacity to receive the blessing that came.<a name=170:8></a> Outwardly it was received in healing diseases, etc.<a name=170:9></a>, but men had no heart to receive Him.<a name=170:10></a> If He turned out the legion of devils from him that was possessed, men turned Him out.<a name=170:11></a> The hearts of men in such a condition were glad to get rid of Him; and this shews another and a deeper evil to be remedied -- that man morally has departed from God, and that he is himself irremediable -- that nothing will do but a new creation: "If any man be in Christ, he is a new creation.<a name=170:12></a>" Thus here the Lord has not only to conquer Satan, but to underlay man in his moral departure from God.<a name=170:13></a> "This is your hour" -- "My soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death "
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Satan brings all this darkness and death to bear on the soul of the Lord, his object being to get between His soul and God.<a name=170:14></a> So, the more pressed by Satan, the nearer to God He is.<a name=170:15></a> Therefore it is said, "being in an agony, he prayed more earnestly"; and in consequence He receives nothing at the hand of Satan, but of His Father.<a name=170:16></a> "The cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?<a name=170:17></a>" Before He left Gethsemane, the whole power of Satan was morally destroyed.<a name=170:18></a> He had gone through the hour with His Father, and now takes the cup at the hand of His Father, as an act of obedience.<a name=170:19></a> He is now as calm as when doing any other miracle (healing the servant's ear), as if nothing had happened.<a name=170:20></a> It was their hour, and the power of darkness was upon them, not on Him.<a name=170:21></a> "Whom seek ye?<a name=170:22></a>" -- "I am he.<a name=170:23></a>" "As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground"; but He presents Himself again (as He says in John 14: 31: "But that the world may know I love the Father .<a name=170:24></a>.<a name=170:25></a>.<a name=170:26></a> Arise, let us go hence") saying, "Whom seek ye?<a name=170:27></a> .<a name=170:28></a>.<a name=170:29></a>.<a name=170:30></a> If therefore ye seek me, let these go their way," and they were not touched, as a token of the complete deliverance of us all.<a name=170:31></a>

		It is to be remarked here that the disciples had leaned on Jesus as the Messiah; their thoughts had been that He should have redeemed Israel (that is, lead them on to comfort and blessing).<a name=176:9></a> There was this character of trust in Messiah, through whom, while with them, they lacked nothing, for He gave them power and blessing; but to the disciples at that time all this was gone.<a name=176:10></a> Jesus on whom they rested, to whom they looked for support and strength, was not there; and to them that knew Him not as risen, everything was gone.<a name=176:11></a> So we may hear of Jesus' name and His love, and this may please and attract the mind when the Lord is working in grace; but, at the same time, it is like the disciples resting on a living Saviour, but with no knowledge that we are lost.<a name=176:12></a> Jesus may have so attracted our minds, that the world may appear to us but loss, and nothing but Jesus valuable; and we may say even as the disciples, "Lord, to whom shall we go?<a name=176:13></a> thou hast the words of eternal life"; but this is not seeing that we are lost, or knowing the power of the resurrection.<a name=176:14></a>

		CHRIST AND THE SPIRIT
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1 Corinthians 2
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We get two things very distinctly here: the wisdom of God in a mystery, the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world to our glory (and that in the Person of the Christ), which the princes of this world did not know, or they would not have crucified the Lord of glory; and then we are told that, as "no man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of a man which is in him, so the things of God knoweth no man but the Spirit of God.<a name=204:1></a>" Therefore the world is in total ignorance of the things of God.<a name=204:2></a> And so we find with men as such.<a name=204:3></a> They may be very learned and clever; but they do not know them.<a name=204:4></a> Nay, it is rather their boast that man can know nothing but what he sees, together with a few conclusions which he may thence draw.<a name=204:5></a> And it is perfectly true too, and therefore one of the most fashionable infidelities of the day at the same time.<a name=204:6></a> Of all that is outside sense they are utterly ignorant; and so they must be.<a name=204:7></a> With all the learning and talent that is in man, if he meddles with things beyond these, he puzzles himself hopelessly.<a name=204:8></a> He only comes either to say, there is no God; or if there is, he does not know what that God is, just as Pilate asked, "What is truth?<a name=204:9></a>" He will make quantities of speculations and very clever ones, but can go no farther.<a name=204:10></a> Yet he has a conscience.<a name=204:11></a> There is a sense of being responsible to some one.<a name=204:12></a> There is a knowledge of the judgment of God (kept out greatly, it is true, by man's will; but God took care when man fell, that he should carry a certain knowledge of good and evil with him after eating of the forbidden fruit).<a name=204:13></a> So he does carry a conscience -- hardened perhaps, but there it is to get hardened and perverted.<a name=204:14></a> You may see it in the case of the poor woman taken in adultery: all her accusers went out one by one convicted by their own consciences.<a name=204:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So it has always been, whether God gives man a law, or man is lawless, still there it is -- a knowledge of good and evil.<a name=204:16></a> And so there is an instinctive sense that there is a judgment, but utter ignorance of what God is, except that He takes account of what man does.<a name=204:17></a> There is some feeling, too, at times, that He is good and must be good; but there is no knowledge of the Spirit of God or of His intentions.<a name=204:18></a> Of course, beyond this, there is Christianity in its general truths floating about us.<a name=204:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=205>[Page 205]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But it is wonderfully expressed here; the wisdom of God in a mystery, hidden wisdom, which none of the princes of this world knew.<a name=205:1></a> There cannot be a more wonderful expression than that, for Christ is the wisdom of God as well as the power of God, and Christ they crucified.<a name=205:2></a> The first thing we learn is, that these counsels of God were before the world.<a name=205:3></a> I am now speaking not of election, but of the plans and thoughts of God <i>before</i> the world was.<a name=205:4></a> There is the distinct contrast in this verse, thoughts and counsels of God ordained for our glory before the world in which we are now living with all its responsibilities.<a name=205:5></a> Now these counsels, which were before the world, had been brought out consequent upon the death of Christ.<a name=205:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would insist for a moment on this, that there is a world which has its own thoughts and objects; but that world crucified the Lord of glory.<a name=205:7></a> All that had the wisdom of this world and its power were found in opposition to Christ.<a name=205:8></a> The governor Pilate, the chief priests and elders of the people, Jew and Gentile, the secular power and the religious power, refused the Lord of glory.<a name=205:9></a> And also there is a world in which we are living which has through the cleverness and skill of man under Satan formed round man a wonderful scene so far as man's thoughts go, pleasures, sciences, and the development of the things given in creation; developing again the talents of man amid these things; wonderful combinations exhibited; great skill in turning things to man's use; beautiful music with rich harmonies: all constituting just Cain's history again.<a name=205:10></a> He had built his city, he had his artificers in brass and iron (and so have we now); he had harp and organ (and so have we now); pleasing himself without thinking of God, shutting God out and making the world pleasant to the natural feelings apart from Him.<a name=205:11></a> It was then and is now alike.<a name=205:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Christians are apt to go along with this world and all these things because they have natural powers to appreciate them.<a name=205:13></a> There is nothing wrong in these things of the world themselves; it is in the use man makes of them the right or the wrong consists.<a name=205:14></a> There is no conscience in these things, no spiritual affections in them, no moral good in them (all God's creatures, of course).<a name=205:15></a> Nor are the things evil.<a name=205:16></a> Why, in heaven we read of the harpers harping with their harps.<a name=205:17></a> It is the use that is made of these things that is wrong; and Christians are very apt to slip into the world's way, and not see the value of what they do, from mere natural delight in things here.<a name=205:18></a> It is a world that is forming pleasures for itself out of what God did create; but it does not care for God, for it rejected Him.<a name=205:19></a> It did not know the Lord of glory, for it is a Cain-world, with plenty of music of its own of course; and Christians take it up as something good that they can share; whereas it was nothing but Cain's world to begin with and Cain's world to go on with.<a name=205:20></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But mark there is another thing altogether -- a reality that was before the world and which is known only by faith.<a name=206:1></a> It is the more solemn because human responsibility began only with this world.<a name=206:2></a> The first Adam was the responsible man, and he failed, and all are sinners since.<a name=206:3></a> This is what came in; it was not the counsel of God (in a sense a counsel known to Him of course), it was not a definite design.<a name=206:4></a> My responsibility is not God's counsels, and <i>that</i> came in after <i>these</i> counsels were formed.<a name=206:5></a> And this is the way of God's dealings and the way He always dealt -- He has a thought which He will bring about; but in the meanwhile things are trusted to man, just as in the case of Adam.<a name=206:6></a> God had the intention of having the second Man and all His glory set up in Him.<a name=206:7></a> This is what God had in His mind.<a name=206:8></a> It was purposed in Christ before the world existed.<a name=206:9></a> After that God set up the first man Adam; and he -- Adam -- is the man of responsibility -- not the man of God's counsels.<a name=206:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And you find the two great principles in the garden at the beginning in the two trees there -- grace that gave life, and responsibility to obey or disobey.<a name=206:11></a> The law took up the same two, but put the responsibility first -- this do and live.<a name=206:12></a> Again a breach followed.<a name=206:13></a> Man made a golden calf at once.<a name=206:14></a> Then when God set up the church, all went to sleep, wise as well as foolish, or said, "My Lord delayeth his coming.<a name=206:15></a>" Then God brings out His counsel ordained before the world -- that He will bring man into His own glory as well as sinless into His presence in Christ.<a name=206:16></a> He forms the church to reign with Christ in that glory.<a name=206:17></a> And nothing of this will He fail to accomplish in result; but first He puts man in responsibility, and man has to learn his total failure in himself, being powerfully convinced by the Spirit and the word of God, so as to be cast upon grace, and find glory.<a name=206:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now it is the place we get into thus that I desire to touch upon.<a name=206:19></a> You may find it in the scheme of God, but yet a soul must go through the question of responsibility for himself.<a name=206:20></a> He must own failure and the way in which he has failed -- that in his flesh there is no good thing at all -- and then, entirely cast on grace, find Christ.<a name=206:21></a> Now Christ as a Saviour meets this position and need by putting Himself in charge of the glory of God which we had compromised.<a name=206:22></a> He came in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, and has met responsibility completely and perfectly, both as regards our sins and the glory of God.<a name=206:23></a> "He bore our sins in his own body on the tree"; and again, "now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.<a name=206:24></a>" He has completed the work, sins are gone, and God's glory is perfectly accomplished; so that all is finished, and the foundation laid, not on the responsibility of the first man, but on the accomplishment of God's work by the second Man, and thus the whole question is ended.<a name=206:25></a> And Christ meets the other want also.<a name=206:26></a> He is the life; He is both the trees; for the ruin that came in is met by Christ on the cross, and infinitely more, by Christ becoming our life.<a name=206:27></a> It is all met now before the things are accomplished in glory, while, as regards the peace of the soul and the redemption of the sinner, and his meetness to be a partaker of the inheritance of the saints in light, it is now a settled thing -- perfectly settled; for he now has life not of the first Adam, but of the Second.<a name=206:28></a> In his mortal body it is now the life of Jesus that is to be manifested; it is Christ who is our life.<a name=206:29></a> This shews that the first thing is judged totally; if any man be in Christ, not only is <i>he</i> a new creature but <i>all</i> is new.<a name=206:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=207>[Page 207]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And you find this borne out through scripture.<a name=207:1></a> In Ephesians it is not a man living in sins but one dead in sins, so that he is not there meeting sinners in their condition as such, but regards them as created in Christ Jesus, God's workmanship.<a name=207:2></a> Consequently there we have the whole full result -- ourselves set in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus brought out.<a name=207:3></a> In Romans we have the condition of the sinner most completely met.<a name=207:4></a> And so the whole thing is settled.<a name=207:5></a> There is a world that Satan has formed round the first man, and the question is whether a believer is to go on with it.<a name=207:6></a> We have to go through it with this testing us -- shall the glory revealed by the Spirit of God, or the world Satan has formed round us in nature, possess our hearts?<a name=207:7></a> I am not talking now of sins; but it is a solemn question whether this world possesses our hearts or not.<a name=207:8></a> The character of things now is not gross immorality; but is the first man to be exalted, or the Second?<a name=207:9></a> Of course there is immorality; but you find persons boasting of a general improvement of society, and with some ground it may be, yet it is all beside the point.<a name=207:10></a> Externally it may be something less gross than in times that have passed, but which man is exalted in your hearts -- the first, or the Second?<a name=207:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the thought and counsels of God, in Christ first as centre, are ordained for our glory that we may be practically drawn out from the world (in spirit altogether).<a name=208:1></a> He has called us in Christ and by Christ, and has made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light.<a name=208:2></a> And are our hearts there?<a name=208:3></a> -- bodies not of course yet, but our hearts?<a name=208:4></a> "Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God; and we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.<a name=208:5></a>" "If so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together" -- suffer truly as regards this world, though at the same time we find <i>it</i> too is all ours, while it does not yet appear what we shall be.<a name=208:6></a> Then how far are our hearts set upon that which we are going to be?<a name=208:7></a> It is wonderful how the scripture insists upon this with Christians.<a name=208:8></a> See in Colossians how it is declared we are dead and our life hid with Christ in God: we get the same share with Him.<a name=208:9></a> God has associated the Christian with Christ.<a name=208:10></a> Now as to your hearts, beloved friends, are they associated with Christ or does the world and its fashion get hold of you?<a name=208:11></a> It touches us all: we all have to go through it; and it is the purpose of God that you should walk by faith and not by sight.<a name=208:12></a> If a man saw God, the greatest sinner in the town would not go and sin in His face.<a name=208:13></a> Like children in a school, it is when the master's back is turned that they fall into mischief.<a name=208:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But mark again this -- God begins by a perfect redemption: you must not have the slightest cloud upon that part of the truth.<a name=208:15></a> Trial of you and your responsibility have nothing to do with judgment and acceptance: on this there is no question.<a name=208:16></a> "There is none righteous, no, not one"; and if God enter into judgment with us, no flesh should be saved, no, not one of you: if you have anything to do with judgment, you have certainly to do with condemnation, and nothing short of it.<a name=208:17></a> And yet we shall appear (be manifested) at the judgment-seat of Christ -- that remains quite true; but to the believer it is not judgment; John 5.<a name=208:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now God, anticipating all this, brings down the full testimony that you are total sinners, and that in your flesh dwelleth no good thing.<a name=208:19></a> God will shew you it all, that He may bring it home to you, by your fears even, if Christ is coming; for you would not feel easy if He came.<a name=208:20></a> But God will bring you to <i>this</i> point if you are to get peace.<a name=208:21></a> He has done with flesh, He has condemned it; and so you can have nothing to do with looking for good in it, because He has condemned it.<a name=208:22></a> The body is dead because of sin.<a name=208:23></a> If it is life, it is alive in sin!<a name=208:24></a>

		It is not a question of amiable qualities -- you find them in a dog; but it is a question whether you like to do your own will; for if you do, you are in rebellion against God.<a name=209:1></a> But God has perfectly redeemed the believer out of all this.<a name=209:2></a> He has gone through the whole scene of man's responsibility, without law, and under law; lastly He sent His Son who was only rejected and then declared "now is the judgment of this world.<a name=209:3></a>" And <i>there</i> is <i>your</i> judgment; you are of that world and belong to it, and you have been judged in its judgment on the cross.<a name=209:4></a> Stephen charges the Jews that they had received the law by the disposition of angels and had not kept it -- "which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted?<a name=209:5></a>" As your fathers resisted the Holy Ghost, so do ye -- killed the prophets; rejected God's Son; resisted the Holy Ghost, and this of God's people on the earth!<a name=209:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, it is all judged.<a name=209:7></a> And if through grace we have been individually brought to a consciousness of it in our own souls, then we are cast exclusively on Christ, and the question is not whether you have failed in your responsibility, but whether God has failed in His work.<a name=209:8></a> This is all the question; and herein too is the truth of the gospel.<a name=209:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What ruined the church (that is, as a thing in man's hand, not of course God's work) was, that the sense of complete redemption was quite lost; the fact, I mean, that man does not stand before God in his condition as a child of Adam at all, but in Christ, after Christ has done God's work for him.<a name=209:10></a> And each one must learn this in his own consciousness for himself.<a name=209:11></a> Christ has borne the things God must have judged man for; and yet more: He becomes our life.<a name=209:12></a> Consequent on this work which He has done, we can say we have died with Him; and He is our life.<a name=209:13></a> The tree is ended, as well as the fruits.<a name=209:14></a> The body of sin is gone for faith; and therefore one can say, "I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.<a name=209:15></a>" This is "I" now.<a name=209:16></a> I do not admit the flesh to be "I" any more.<a name=209:17></a> <i>He</i> is my life; "Christ liveth in me.<a name=209:18></a>" This is what deliverance means -- not forgiveness only but deliverance.<a name=209:19></a> Deliverance is that we are not in the flesh at all, not in that which has man's responsibility before God.<a name=209:20></a> There is therefore no question of meetness.<a name=209:21></a> Christ is meet for heaven; and whosoever is in Christ is also meet for heaven.<a name=209:22></a> You must add to the value of Christ's work before you can add to the title of your meetness for heaven.<a name=209:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then comes another thing.<a name=210:1></a> The moment the Christian is seen in Christ -- that not merely He has borne my sins, but I am in Christ -- there is one who can be sealed with the Spirit of God.<a name=210:2></a> If he is born again and washed by the blood of Christ, the Holy Ghost can dwell in him.<a name=210:3></a> We must never confound the quickening of a soul with the presence of the Spirit which seals Christ's work.<a name=210:4></a> The Holy Ghost quickens my soul, and brings me under the blood of sprinkling whereby I am as white as snow: after this the Holy Ghost comes to dwell in me as thus washed clean.<a name=210:5></a> God sees me perfectly cleansed and the Holy Ghost is the seal of it and of me -- all in virtue of the efficacy of Christ's blood.<a name=210:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The presence of the Holy Ghost is a consequence of redemption.<a name=210:7></a> When Christ had by Himself purged our sins, He sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high, and "being by the right hand of God exalted and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this which ye now see and hear"; and further, "because ye are sons God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into our hearts whereby we cry, Abba Father," and then you see at once this gives me a capacity to enjoy whatever God opens up to me.<a name=210:8></a> But Paul says, "we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery"; but even a crucified Christ was a stumbling-block to a Jew and foolishness to a Greek.<a name=210:9></a> Ah!<a name=210:10></a> you may be a Jew or a philosopher; but are you not a sinner?<a name=210:11></a> This is all God knows about you.<a name=210:12></a> You must all meet God at the cross of Christ, or be judged.<a name=210:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having brought this in, the apostle goes on to say, "we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our glory; which none of the princes of this world knew, or they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.<a name=210:14></a>" Now here we find Christ in the glory -- a man there; and, connected with Him, God can bring out all these counsels.<a name=210:15></a> Christ, who is the centre of it all, is actually a Man in heavenly glory; and, further, the Holy Ghost can come down and unfold all this.<a name=210:16></a> Man is in the glory of God, as Stephen shews at the very turning-point of man's depravity in resisting the Holy Ghost.<a name=210:17></a> Then the mystery comes out.<a name=210:18></a> The Holy Ghost having been sent down, associates us with it on the footing of a place in Christ (the old man is set aside -- "ye are dead").<a name=210:19></a> We stand in a righteousness in Christ which is God's righteousness, when man had none.<a name=210:20></a> Now the Holy Ghost can bring in all the heavenly glory, and this is what He is doing for the Christian.<a name=210:21></a> We have the life and the righteousness of God in Christ.<a name=210:22></a>

		INDWELLING OF THE HOLY GHOST

	<div class="paragraph">
		1 Corinthians 6
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is nothing, perhaps, more striking in reading either the Gospels, or the Epistles, the sayings of the Lord Jesus Himself, or what, in some respects, are more wonderful, the statements of the apostles, than the entire familiarity that appears in them, with the highest divine things.<a name=215:1></a> It is never, of course, nor could it be, that familiarity which, in human things, because of their imperfection, takes away reverence.<a name=215:2></a> But the nearer we are to God, the more we see His blessedness, while there will be the reverence that becomes His presence; at the same time there is perfect familiarity with the highest divine things.<a name=215:3></a> It stamps the one born of God; it stamps the divine revelation that we have.<a name=215:4></a> I can tell that the Father loves the Son -- nothing can be simpler than the expression; but what a thing to know His divine affections in themselves!<a name=215:5></a> It is not merely that He loves me, as is very true; but the Father loves the Son.<a name=215:6></a> So with the divine counsels.<a name=215:7></a> He hath "made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure, which he hath purposed in himself.<a name=215:8></a>" It is all brought out; as it is expressed in that word, "Ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things.<a name=215:9></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not that simply certain testimonies have come out; this was the case with the prophets; or that certain commandments have been given which are the most perfect expression of what man ought to be, as in the law; but God has revealed Himself, and that in the perfectness of His own love, that He might be known.<a name=215:10></a> Along with this, and especially characterising Christianity, there is not only the perfect revelation of Himself in His own nature as God, as light and love, revealing the Father, Son, and Spirit; but He has given us the Spirit.<a name=215:11></a> Having made us "partakers of the divine nature," that we might be capable of enjoying what He is; He has also given us the Holy Ghost, that we might know what He is.<a name=215:12></a> You get, first, our being set before God in perfect acceptance, "accepted in the Beloved.<a name=215:13></a>" And then, beyond that, the truth that God has not only revealed Himself to us, that we might have confidence in coming to Him in Christ, but that He reveals Himself in us after having set us in Christ there, that the conscience should be placed in His presence.<a name=215:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=216>[Page 216]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		At the same time we read in Ephesians of being "strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man"; it is also said in the same Epistle, "that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith.<a name=216:1></a>" So that He who is the centre of all the thoughts and counsels of God, of all His glory as revealed, the Son Himself dwells in us, and sets us thus in the centre of all this glory, that we should comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height.<a name=216:2></a> It is not only that there has been a revelation to us of the Father and Son and the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ, but that He has so associated us with Christ as dwelling in us, and that by the power of the Holy Ghost, that He sets our souls in the centre of all these affections, and of all this knowledge and glory.<a name=216:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Therefore the apostle cannot exactly say what it is, but only says "what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height," and adds, "and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.<a name=216:4></a>" He has been a man, and dwelt among us, yet He dwells in us, and His love passes knowledge.<a name=216:5></a> This brings us into such blessed intimacy, though ever more adoringly; for the more we know Him, the more we shall see that He is God.<a name=216:6></a> So even with Christ Himself.<a name=216:7></a> We are there in the same glory with Himself; but this only brings us into the capacity to know the infinite blessedness of His Person.<a name=216:8></a> We see this in the scene of the transfiguration.<a name=216:9></a> The moment there was the thought in the heart, "Let us make three tabernacles, one for thee, one for Moses, and one for Elias," the Father says, "This is my beloved Son: hear him.<a name=216:10></a>" Christ stands alone.<a name=216:11></a> Yet we now by the grace which associates us with Him, are brought into that which is divinely blessed and perfect; such is the peculiar blessedness of Christianity.<a name=216:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not now merely sending out a law to shew what man ought to be, but it is eternal life given, in the true knowledge of the Father and Son, and this in the power of the Holy Ghost.<a name=216:13></a> Therefore the affections of the heart are of the Spirit, and are filled with the Spirit, and they have their play in all true Christian affection.<a name=216:14></a> Being brought into such a place, all our ways, the condition of our soul and our conduct of course are looked for to be conformed to that of which Christ Himself is the perfect expression.<a name=216:15></a> It is not merely that there is a certain rule of conduct, as in the law, but it is Christ dwelling in our hearts by faith; so that our thoughts, and feelings, and affections should flow from that source through the Holy Ghost.<a name=216:16></a> That is what is meant by being "filled with the Spirit.<a name=216:17></a>" We all have the Spirit, but we are not all "filled with the Spirit.<a name=216:18></a>" He is the one source of everything where the heart is filled with Him.<a name=216:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		That which is here brought before us is not only the blessedness of the place we are put in, but the conduct of the Christian suitable to it in every respect.<a name=217:1></a> And it is that which suits the presence of the Holy Ghost dwelling in him.<a name=217:2></a> Whatever is not fit for His presence is not fit for the Christian.<a name=217:3></a> It will come down to the most ordinary things of life, because there is a path which is pleasing to God in this world -- there is one way for a person to walk, and no other.<a name=217:4></a> Supposing a son has left his father's house, and has gone off to a strange country; he may not be outwardly given up to what shocks the conscience, but he cannot, as long as he is there, do right; he must go back in order to do what is right; until he does this, in all he does there is not one thing that is right.<a name=217:5></a> This is the way with man in the world.<a name=217:6></a> He has left God, and cannot do anything right, never can do anything positively right, till he gets back.<a name=217:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we are in our right place, we do not want a way.<a name=217:8></a> Adam wanted no way in the garden of Eden; his business was to stay where he was.<a name=217:9></a> In the world, where wickedness is, we want a way; but there is no way really, because we have departed from God.<a name=217:10></a> But when the Spirit of God has come into it, He has created a path for him that believes.<a name=217:11></a> For the Jews in the wilderness, where the cloud went, there was a way directly.<a name=217:12></a> God can make a way for Himself, no matter how wicked the world.<a name=217:13></a> If I injure a man, it is wrong; and if he revenges himself, it is wrong; but Christ can make a way through it all.<a name=217:14></a> He can give me to walk with wisdom and patience in all circumstances.<a name=217:15></a> He can bring in motives and principles for every difficulty of this world; and that is where the Christian has to walk.<a name=217:16></a> "He that saith he abideth in him, ought himself also so to walk even as he walked.<a name=217:17></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The life of Jesus should be manifested in us.<a name=217:18></a> Our life ought to be the expression of this new thing -- that is, divine life in the midst of a world that is away from God.<a name=217:19></a> Nothing but Christ can do that, and it is Christ in us.<a name=217:20></a> The power of it is by the presence of the Holy Ghost acting upon "the new man which after God is created in righteousness and in true holiness.<a name=217:21></a>" It is not the old thing corrected at all, because the old man never can have the divine motives, but its own motives.<a name=217:22></a> It may be corrected in an outward thing, for people are not all thieves and robbers; but it never can have the motives that belong to the divine nature, and therefore, though it may be decent and respectable, it never can be right.<a name=217:23></a> It is the nature that has departed from God, and it cannot be right before Him.<a name=217:24></a> We read that that which we have (the new man) is "after God, created in righteousness and in true holiness.<a name=217:25></a>" And in another part it is said that it is "renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him.<a name=217:26></a>" The measure of spiritual knowledge, as to the walk and affections, is the image of Him who created us; and where do I see this perfectly?<a name=217:27></a> In Christ.<a name=217:28></a> He is "the image of the invisible God.<a name=217:29></a>" The power of that life was shewn in the resurrection; the character of that life was shewn in all His path on earth.<a name=217:30></a> He was "declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead.<a name=217:31></a>" The declaration of the power of the life was in resurrection; the character of it we see in the Son of God walking in this world; and Christ is our life.<a name=217:32></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two characters of relationship into which we are brought: one is our union with Christ; and the other our relationship along with Christ to God as our Father, He being the firstborn of many brethren.<a name=222:1></a> "As is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.<a name=222:2></a> And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.<a name=222:3></a>" This last is the result in glory, but it is founded on the great truth of "As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy, and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.<a name=222:4></a>" It flows from our connection with the second Man (He, Head of a spiritual race, as the first Adam was head according to the flesh).<a name=222:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is a different thing from His relationship to the bride, and the headship of the body.<a name=222:6></a> It teaches us how the whole of the Old Testament scripture looks at our history in the first Adam, closing that history entirely, and then brings in a new One.<a name=222:7></a> This is not brought out until the second Man is raised from the dead.<a name=222:8></a> He was in Person the same before, but He was not head of a spiritual race until He was raised.<a name=222:9></a> "Except the corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone," etc.<a name=222:10></a> It was only then that He could take such a position with His disciples as to say, "I go to my Father and your Father.<a name=222:11></a>" All thought of any union as man, with Christ, is wrong.<a name=222:12></a> He could not unite Himself with us in sin: He could shew compassion, but it was impossible there could be any connection between us in the flesh, as men in nature, and God.<a name=222:13></a> When Christ takes a new position, outside every position in which flesh could be taken account of, we are united to Him in spirit; but the whole history of man shews the impossibility of connection between man in nature with God.<a name=222:14></a> "Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.<a name=222:15></a>" "And as I said to the Jews, even so say I to you, Whither I go, ye cannot follow me now.<a name=222:16></a>" Flesh, corrupt and corrupting, cannot enter into glory.<a name=222:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		True, flesh works in the believer; but Scripture goes deep and brings out this truth, "in me, that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing.<a name=222:18></a>" So the apostle afterwards says, "When we were in the flesh.<a name=222:19></a>" I do not know whether you would be able to say that -- when I was in the flesh.<a name=222:20></a> If we can say so, our responsibility now is to walk as men in the Spirit.<a name=222:21></a> A Christian is not to walk as a man, but as a Christian.<a name=222:22></a> There are duties of husbands, wives, children; and the relationships between man and man have to be sustained of course; but before God I am not looked at as a man in the flesh at all.<a name=222:23></a> The flesh tries to hinder.<a name=222:24></a> It comes to be a hostile power to what I have from the last Adam; but if you walk merely as men, you are lost.<a name=222:25></a>

		Flesh shewed its weakness.<a name=223:1></a> The word to Adam did not provide for sin, and supposed no lust in man.<a name=223:2></a> In the garden of Eden lust came in, sin came in, and the separation was complete between God and man.<a name=223:3></a> Adam then became head of an excluded race.<a name=223:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Law, given afterwards, supposed men needing life, but invoked responsibility.<a name=223:5></a> Man left to himself became corrupt before God.<a name=223:6></a> The earth was filled with violence.<a name=223:7></a> Then a flood came.<a name=223:8></a> Then came the law as a trial of man.<a name=223:9></a> Promise was not a trial of man, but it manifested grace without a question of man.<a name=223:10></a> There was no promise to Adam, the promise was to the second Adam, the Seed of the woman.<a name=223:11></a> God cannot promise to sin.<a name=223:12></a> There was no question of responsibility in promise.<a name=223:13></a> He gave it to man and left it.<a name=223:14></a> Afterwards the question of righteousness is raised.<a name=223:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We too often may little weigh what the terms of the law imply.<a name=223:16></a> Were I to say, If you do this, you will get a fortune, this implies that you have not a fortune without.<a name=223:17></a> You cannot say, Do this and live, if you have life.<a name=223:18></a> When God said to man, "Do this and live," it implied his being dead.<a name=223:19></a> Man did not think so, but it was the ministry of death and condemnation, because it demanded obedience, which man could not render.<a name=223:20></a> Law does bring out man's guilt; he cannot be subject to the law of God.<a name=223:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there was another thing that proved his guilt far more thoroughly.<a name=223:22></a> Will they accept God's terms when He came to them in grace?<a name=223:23></a> Christ came, and in His life was the perfect manifestation of goodness.<a name=223:24></a> He came amongst men to do them good, healing the leper, etc.<a name=223:25></a> But could flesh find anything attractive in Him?<a name=223:26></a> He was an outcast among the people to whom He brought home the goodness and love of God.<a name=223:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When law was given, they were not subject to it; and when Christ came, they would not have Him.<a name=223:28></a> Therefore the Lord said, "Now is the prince of this world judged.<a name=223:29></a>" "They have both seen and hated both me and my Father.<a name=223:30></a>" Man, tried in every way, is proved to be bad.<a name=223:31></a>

		In other circumstances, namely, that of the Christian, there is the flesh lusting against the Spirit, and the same impossibility of its pleasing God.<a name=224:1></a> All flesh shews utter rejection of God Himself, and is proud of itself all the time.<a name=224:2></a> Before God executes judgment, man has entirely cast God off.<a name=224:3></a> The wonder of the cross is that He came -- the sinless One came into the very place where flesh is.<a name=224:4></a> "He who knew no sin was made sin for us.<a name=224:5></a>" He finds Himself in the fully revealed position of man before God; He puts Himself there in grace and in obedience too.<a name=224:6></a> There was more than that: "He bore our sins in his own body on the tree.<a name=224:7></a>" He was "made sin," and put it away by giving up the life in which He bore it.<a name=224:8></a> God deals with Him about sin, and the very life ceases in which He takes it, and then He rises up.<a name=224:9></a> God had dealt with it, putting an end to it entirely on the cross.<a name=224:10></a> There was an end of the old man; and now it is said, "Reckon yourselves to be dead," etc.<a name=224:11></a> "He that is dead is freed from sin.<a name=224:12></a>" Christ has taken the place of the first Adam in sin.<a name=224:13></a> All that I was in, Christ has stepped into and borne.<a name=224:14></a> He rises up, and I have an entirely new position.<a name=224:15></a> I am now in Christ.<a name=224:16></a> He has closed for ever the history of the flesh (we have it as an enemy -- but its history is closed for ever before God) and commenced a place for us in Himself, the second Adam.<a name=224:17></a> "Father, glorify thy Son.<a name=224:18></a>"

		AN EPISTLE OF CHRIST
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2 Corinthians 3
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle, in the beginning of this chapter, tells us what a true Christian is.<a name=227:1></a> He calls him an epistle of Christ.<a name=227:2></a> He is a person upon whose heart God has written Christ, as Moses wrote the law on tables of stone.<a name=227:3></a> This the apostle opens out; but first he states what Christians are in contrast with the law.<a name=227:4></a> A Christian is a person on whom Christ is engraved, not on tables of stone, but on the fleshy tables of the heart.<a name=227:5></a> If the heart is serious, one must see that many have not this.<a name=227:6></a> We see many persons very amiable, and others with a trying nature.<a name=227:7></a> But here it is not difference of mere natural character.<a name=227:8></a> This is not the point.<a name=227:9></a> Natural amiability of character is not Christ graved on the heart.<a name=227:10></a> It has nothing to do with being a Christian, which is a positive real work of God.<a name=227:11></a> It is the Holy Ghost engraving Christ on a man's heart, putting Christ into his thoughts, his words, and his ways, just as the law was put upon stones.<a name=227:12></a> Now a person may get angry at this; but nevertheless Christ is the object of a Christian's life, and your own conscience must judge if it is so with you.<a name=227:13></a> It is not that there is not failure.<a name=227:14></a> A man who is seeking to make money does not always succeed; but everybody knows what his object is.<a name=227:15></a> Just so <i>Christ is the object of a believer's life</i>.<a name=227:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God gave the law, not to make men righteous, but to prove that there were none righteous.<a name=227:17></a> The law condemns every one.<a name=227:18></a> It was the ministration of death.<a name=227:19></a> But after men had broken God's law, He sent His Son.<a name=227:20></a> "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son.<a name=227:21></a>" "When the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son.<a name=227:22></a>" God's Son has been in the world.<a name=227:23></a> How comes it that He is out of it?<a name=227:24></a> The world would not have Him.<a name=227:25></a> Men spit in His face.<a name=227:26></a> This is what the world has done.<a name=227:27></a> Now I do not ask you about duties; but I ask, is Christ engraven on your heart?<a name=227:28></a> We cannot kill Him now; but our hearts can reject Him as much as ever the Jews did.<a name=227:29></a> An honest man -- I do not speak of a Christian -- will own that from morning to night Christ is not in his heart.<a name=227:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now what was the apostle doing?<a name=227:31></a> When a Christian went from one place to another, it was customary to give him a letter of commendation.<a name=227:32></a> But, says the apostle, Do I want a letter?<a name=227:33></a> If one came to him to ask what he went about doing, he would say, Look at these Corinthians (for they were going on well then): they were his letter.<a name=227:34></a> How so?<a name=227:35></a> <i>Because they were Christ's</i>.<a name=227:36></a> Now I leave it with you as to whether Christ is on your heart.<a name=227:37></a> I do not ask if you love Him as you ought; for if you love Him at all, you will not say that; He is too precious for that.<a name=227:38></a> But if you are a Christian, you are sure there is not anything that you would not give for Christ.<a name=227:39></a> You may not be able to govern yourself, still Christ is the object of your heart.<a name=227:40></a>

		Notice now another thing: "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.<a name=228:1></a>" It is not liberty to be fearing and trembling before God.<a name=228:2></a> "Liberty" is to be happy with Him.<a name=228:3></a> When the Holy Ghost begins to shew me my sins, I have anything but liberty.<a name=228:4></a> I begin to be afraid of my sins; I do not know whatever to do with them.<a name=228:5></a> False liberty is taken away, and true liberty is not given.<a name=228:6></a> And this will always be the case until the perfect love of God is seen.<a name=228:7></a> Now law will never teach me that.<a name=228:8></a> Suppose I command my child to love me, and threaten him if he does not; will that make him love me?<a name=228:9></a> Why, it will make him tremble.<a name=228:10></a> This is what the law does.<a name=228:11></a> It cannot produce the love, it can but command.<a name=228:12></a> What is the effect?<a name=228:13></a> I cannot stand in its presence.<a name=228:14></a> When Moses had been up on the mount, his face shone.<a name=228:15></a> He had been with God.<a name=228:16></a> And when he came down with the two tables of the law, the children of Israel were afraid to come near him.<a name=228:17></a> He had to put a veil on his face for the glory of his countenance.<a name=228:18></a> After being in the presence of God's glory, they cannot bear to look on him.<a name=228:19></a> The only effect of the revelation of the glory of God is to drive me away as far as ever I can get from Him against whom I have sinned.<a name=228:20></a> There is not a pleasure in the world that the presence of God would not blast in a moment.<a name=228:21></a> There is not a happiness of man, as man, that is not spoiled by the very mention of the name of God.<a name=228:22></a> Now think what a terrible state that is to be in.<a name=228:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle calls this claim of God by the law the "ministration of death and condemnation"; because it claims righteousness, and does not produce the thing it claims.<a name=228:24></a> Whenever a person is looking to his conduct for what he ought to be, he is under the ministry of death and condemnation.<a name=228:25></a> That is not the way to get Christ written on the heart.<a name=228:26></a>

		Before we turn to look at Christ as He is now, let us look at what He was, God manifest in the flesh.<a name=228:27></a> In what state did He find men when He came?<a name=228:28></a> He found them "all under sin.<a name=228:29></a>" And what does Job say of himself, as being in this condition?<a name=228:30></a> "If I wash myself with snow-water, and make my hands never so clean, yet thou shalt plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me.<a name=228:31></a> Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his hand upon us both.<a name=228:32></a> Let him take his fear away, then would I speak; but it is not so with me.<a name=228:33></a>"

		It is good for our souls to dwell on what it is to be an epistle of Christ, though I am sure none of us can express the greatness of the calling.<a name=231:1></a> Any gathering of the saints is the epistle of Christ, "to be read of men.<a name=231:2></a>" They are His letter of recommendation to the world.<a name=231:3></a> The world needs to ascertain what Christ is from the lives of the saints; although they might learn it, it is true, from the word.<a name=231:4></a> And the great importance of this place of witness is brought out by the tacit contrast with the law, "written in tables of stone.<a name=231:5></a>" Just as the ten commandments were the declaration of the mind of God, under the dispensation of the law; so now the church is the engraving of Christ, "written, not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart," to shew forth the virtues of Him "who hath called us out of darkness into his marvellous light.<a name=231:6></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		I would refer to one great thing in the life of Christ, namely, that He never, in one simple act, word, or movement of His heart, did a single thing to please Himself.<a name=231:7></a> "Christ pleased not himself"; and so "we ought not to please ourselves"; for "none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.<a name=231:8></a>" Jesus said, "that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do.<a name=231:9></a>" This was obedience flowing out of love, and manifesting love.<a name=231:10></a> Nothing ever moved Him from that.<a name=231:11></a> The temptation to move from obedience to a commandment might come in a very subtle form, with all the ardour of affection; as when Peter said, in answer to the Lord's word about His sufferings and death, "This be far from thee, Lord.<a name=231:12></a>" It was affectionate in Peter; but the Lord would not own it, for this would have been to turn from the Father's commandment.<a name=231:13></a> And what does He answer?<a name=231:14></a> "Get thee behind me, Satan; thou art an offence unto me, for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.<a name=231:15></a>"

		Another thing I would remark.<a name=231:16></a> Not only was Jesus heavenly in His nature, but, as Son of man, He lived in heaven -- as He said, "the Son of man which is in heaven.<a name=231:17></a>" The whole spirit of His mind, the tone of all His feelings and thoughts, was heavenly.<a name=231:18></a> So if there is any motive in my heart which I could not have if I were in heaven, I am not like Christ.<a name=231:19></a>

		Again, all the grace that was in Him was brought out to meet man's sorrow and misery, and to bear on every earthly circumstance.<a name=231:20></a> In this we often find our failure.<a name=231:21></a> Even when the motive is right, the manner is wanting in graciousness.<a name=231:22></a> But it was never so with Christ.<a name=231:23></a> He was always seeking to promote the glory of God; but never did He in manner, on any occasion, depart from the spirit of grace.<a name=231:24></a> We often are not close enough in our communion with God to have confidence in Him.<a name=231:25></a> We become impatient, and resort to means that are not of God, as Jacob did, who had not confidence enough in God to say, "He will secure the blessing.<a name=231:26></a>" Would not God have made Isaac give the right answer?<a name=231:27></a> Surely He would.<a name=231:28></a> So we often fail by not waiting upon God, who will bring the thing to pass most surely, though we know not how.<a name=231:29></a> So it was in the sorrowful case of Saul.<a name=231:30></a> He would not wait; yet Samuel came at the end of seven days, and Saul lost the kingdom.<a name=231:31></a> And those who really are the children of God always sustain loss when they depart from confidence in Him.<a name=231:32></a> Christ was always trusting in God, and always waiting upon Him; and so He was ever ready for every sorrow and misery; ever ready to bring out the resources of God to meet every necessity.<a name=231:33></a> It is touching to read Matthew 5.<a name=231:34></a> Every beatitude is a lively portrait of Christ.<a name=231:35></a> Who so poor in spirit as Christ?<a name=231:36></a> Who mourned as Christ?<a name=231:37></a> Who so meek?<a name=231:38></a> so hungering and thirsting after righteousness?<a name=231:39></a> His whole life was hungering and thirsting after righteousness.<a name=231:40></a> "The life was the light of men.<a name=231:41></a>"<a name=232>[Page 232]</a>

		In the latter part of the chapter, the apostle tells us how we may be acting as the epistles of Christ -- ministers, not of the letter, but of the spirit.<a name=233:1></a> The letter refers to the requirements of God from man, which necessarily was a ministration of death.<a name=233:2></a> But the gospel is the manifestation of God, not from Sinai, requiring righteousness; but from His own throne revealing the accomplishment of His own righteousness, and sending a message concerning it to draw our hearts to Himself.<a name=233:3></a> To those who submit themselves to this righteousness, the Holy Ghost is given on the foundation of the righteousness, and He is in them a Spirit of power.<a name=233:4></a> So now we can use great plainness of speech, because we are speaking of grace.<a name=233:5></a> We can tell men that they are wicked, wretched, and helpless.<a name=233:6></a> We can speak all things plainly, because we are not expecting anything from them, but telling them of God's grace to just such as they are.<a name=233:7></a> We can speak plainly of God, for it is of the God of all grace.<a name=233:8></a> Israel could not look at the reflection of the glory in the face of Moses, poor though it was; but now man can look plainly -- wonderful to say -- at the full glory of God, because it is now in the face of Jesus.<a name=233:9></a> It is this very glory that tells me of the putting away of my sin.<a name=233:10></a> I see the glory of God, not dimly, but as of one who put Himself in my place as a sinner, and who could not be in that glory If He had not put away all my sins; for my sins are enough to dim any glory.<a name=233:11></a> What a glorious thing, not only to see God visiting my soul in grace, but that, so to speak, the glory has taken the place of my sins!<a name=233:12></a> The transition from the cross has left nothing between them!<a name=233:13></a> Thus we get righteousness in our Head, and the Spirit goes with the message, so that there is power, for "where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.<a name=233:14></a>"

		The soul that submits to the righteousness of God becomes the epistle of Christ, because he is looking at Christ in the glory.<a name=233:15></a> This cannot be while only looking at Him down here; but when the eye is fixed on the Lord Jesus in glory, we are changed into the same image.<a name=233:16></a> The heart living in the glory counts all things else but dross and dung in comparison.<a name=233:17></a> This is the real victory -- when all of this world surrounds me, to say, I do count them but dross and dung.<a name=233:18></a> This is being like Christ.<a name=233:19></a> We soon learn the weakness of the flesh in this, but the faith that thus looks to Christ is the true victory.<a name=233:20></a> The apostle said, "I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.<a name=233:21></a>" We sometimes say this too lightly, for we have not proved it.<a name=233:22></a> We may say a believer can do all things, but he could say, I can do all things through Christ, for he had proved it by deep experience and arduous conflict.<a name=233:23></a><a name=234>[Page 234]</a>

		It has struck me latterly in the last verse, we never attain the glory while down here, yet are always looking at it as an object, and "changed into the same image," but we are not actually in any sense the same.<a name=234:8></a> Still we are daily growing up into Him who is the Head -- who is in the glory.<a name=234:9></a> Paul says, "I press towards the mark .<a name=234:10></a>.<a name=234:11></a>.<a name=234:12></a> if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection," at the end rather than at the beginning of his course; yet he had attained a great deal, if you look at him as to the realisation of power.<a name=234:13></a> Now, that is what the individual Christian is called to, founded on the ministration of righteousness: glory and righteousness go together.<a name=234:14></a> It is not now merely that God forbears -- this He did before; but He declares His righteousness; it is a righteousness now obtained, not a future thing.<a name=234:15></a> The law required righteousness from man, but that is a different thing from the administration of righteousness to man.<a name=234:16></a> Now He, Christ, is giving it unto us.<a name=234:17></a> The law was called the ministration of condemnation.<a name=234:18></a> The ministration of righteousness is also called the ministration of the Spirit, because the Spirit is here in virtue of accomplished righteousness in the Person of Christ, who is up there in the glory.<a name=234:19></a> "He that ministereth to you the Spirit.<a name=234:20></a>" Since redemption God ministers to each saint the Holy Spirit.<a name=234:21></a>

		Righteousness is shewn by God in two ways: first, in setting Christ at His own right hand; secondly, in not letting the world see Him any more, whom it rejected and cast out.<a name=235:1></a> The Spirit now convicts the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment: "of sin," in rejecting Christ; "of righteousness," because Christ is gone to the Father; "of judgment," because the prince of this world is judged.<a name=235:2></a> If I receive the demonstration, I partake of it, and the demonstration of righteousness placed Christ on the throne at the right hand of God.<a name=235:3></a> "I go to my Father.<a name=235:4></a>" In verse 7: "So that they could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance," etc.<a name=235:5></a> There was no veil, but the state of Israel was such that they could not bear a sight of the glory, "which glory was to be done away.<a name=235:6></a>" So in verse 13, Moses put a veil over his face, that the children of Israel might not look to the end of that which was abolished; shewing, I believe, the moral condition of the people, for Moses had no veil when he went to God, but they could not get beyond the outward thing.<a name=235:7></a> The veil was over Moses' face, and all was veiled to them, so that they could not see to the end.<a name=235:8></a> He is here giving the meaning of the act: they could not see to the end, but stopped short in the things given.<a name=235:9></a> The veil is now not on the things but on their heart, which is done away in Christ; "nevertheless, when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away.<a name=235:10></a>" In Christ everything is fully revealed in the reality and truth of it, not in mere types and shadows.<a name=235:11></a> They could not see to the end; it is always because of the hardness of their hearts, though the veil is at one time on the glory, and at another on their hearts.<a name=235:12></a> Moses put a veil over his face, but it was God's purpose being fulfilled.<a name=235:13></a> Now we are not as Moses, but use great plainness of speech.<a name=235:14></a> It is not now about the people, but about the ministration.<a name=235:15></a>

		It is of the utmost importance that we should thoroughly get hold of what the church is and its identification with the Lord Jesus.<a name=238:21></a> Its importance may be gathered from the very many and various ways the enemy seeks to attack that truth, and it is always liable to be let slip, for it is easily lost.<a name=238:22></a> To have the one truth, that I am in and associated with Christ, uppermost in my thoughts, is a most difficult thing, and the easiest lost of any, because it is a thought, of course, of the Spirit, and nature will always sink the soul down into something in which it is to satisfy God.<a name=238:23></a> I am to understand that the power working in my soul is "according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places.<a name=238:24></a>" And it will not do if the soul has not taken up its position with Christ.<a name=238:25></a> One need not speak of hypocrisy, but sincerity will not do.<a name=238:26></a> I ought to crucify the world, and the heart should settle down easy and happy.<a name=238:27></a> This puts Satan out.<a name=238:28></a> I do not mean that there would be no conflict with him, but we must keep him outside.<a name=238:29></a> Satan always acts on the flesh; he has no power over the new man.<a name=238:30></a> If we are in the light, all things are made manifest.<a name=238:31></a> What a wondrous thing to say we are "one spirit with the Lord!<a name=238:32></a>" "He that is joined to the Lord is one spirit"; and what persons we should be if abiding under the power of that one spirit with the Lord in heaven!<a name=238:33></a> What great peace we should enjoy, now that nature is duly judged!<a name=238:34></a> The knowledge of righteousness, without the present power of the Holy Ghost, has led many into Antinomianism.<a name=238:35></a> They have turned to the flesh to keep down the flesh; and it is impossible, if a man is so occupied with himself, to keep him from self-importance.<a name=238:36></a> A danger exists that, when some have seen the truth of the church being in heavenly places, and there has been the labour and working of the soul itself, they may get a great many ideas of the blessedness of the glory, without having got peace, because they have not got their souls on the ground of righteousness, by which alone we are enabled to crucify the flesh.<a name=238:37></a> If, all of a sudden, the question were seriously put, Are you safe and ready to be taken?<a name=238:38></a> they would be all aback; the ground of the heart is not so thoroughly ploughed up as that they know they are made the righteousness of God in Him.<a name=238:39></a> Job said, "I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye seeth thee; wherefore I abhor myself," etc.<a name=238:40></a> Was that the first time Job had seen God?<a name=238:41></a> Yes, in that way.<a name=238:42></a> God will have nothing but good in His presence, and the soul finds itself nothing but evil, and says, "then I cannot have it.<a name=238:43></a>" But it is His grace that is working.<a name=238:44></a> The soul, brought into the presence of God in that way, rests in His perfect grace, and has done with itself; then all the bright place into which it is brought is enjoyed; and we eat the corn of the land.<a name=238:45></a>

		THE CHRISTIAN A REPRESENTATIVE OF CHRIST
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2 Corinthians 3
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This chapter brings out the way in which the power of the truth works on our souls to bring us into the presence of the Lord.<a name=241:1></a> It begins with the effect of this in testimony to others; and then lets us know <i>how</i> the effect is produced -- what a Christian, and so what the church, really is.<a name=241:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Corinthians had been calling in question the apostolic authority of Paul.<a name=241:3></a> How does he meet this?<a name=241:4></a> He appeals to themselves, to their own calling of God when they were turned from idols to Him, "as the <i>seal</i> of his apostleship.<a name=241:5></a>" It is as though he said, "If Christ has not spoken by me, how is it that you are Christians?<a name=241:6></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So chapter 12: 3-5 is not at all a precept to doubt, to examine and call in question their own Christianity.<a name=241:7></a> The apostle is shewing the absurdity of their doubt of him.<a name=241:8></a> "If you want to examine me, examine yourselves: you commend my ministry, because you commend Christ.<a name=241:9></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then he goes on to tell us what a Christian is.<a name=241:10></a> He is a representative of Christ, just as much as the tables of stone were the representation of the law.<a name=241:11></a> Only in that case the writing being with the Spirit of the living God, not with ink, Christ is engraven on the heart by the power of the Holy Ghost, and they known and read of all men.<a name=241:12></a> The world ought to see Christ engraven on the heart of a Christian, just as much as Israel could see the letter of the law on the tables.<a name=241:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is written on the "tables of the heart," by the "Spirit of the living God.<a name=241:14></a>" Thus merely outward conduct (though there must be that for the world to see) will not do, but Christ <i>within</i>, as the motive and end of all we do.<a name=241:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a certain external respect for right and wrong as the result of the Bible and professed Christianity in these countries, which we do not find among the heathen.<a name=241:16></a> Thus a man may be following lawful pursuits, and be all that is correct outwardly and morally, yet, if Christ is not the motive, it is all good for nothing.<a name=241:17></a> God did not send His Son into the world to bring in a negative Christianity.<a name=241:18></a> There must be that result which is worthy of the work.<a name=241:19></a> It must be evident through the power of the Holy Ghost.<a name=241:20></a> There will be failure, for we are poor feeble creatures; but the world will see where we are going by the road that we take.<a name=241:21></a> A man may get on slowly or stumble, but it is evident what road he is going.<a name=241:22></a>

		We have to look to ourselves and see how far we are devotedly following Christ, with full purpose of heart -- how far we can say, This one thing I do; but we must take care at the same time not to get into legal bondage by this standard.<a name=242:1></a> If I say, "Here is a rule of conduct: follow it," this cannot reach the heart, the affections.<a name=242:2></a> The ministration of the letter brings only failure, condemnation, and death; for it prescribes a rule which man, being a sinner, can never follow.<a name=242:3></a> It does not <i>change</i> man, but it puts him under death; it proves him "ungodly and without strength.<a name=242:4></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may turn even Christ into that letter of condemnation; we may take His life, for instance, and make it our law.<a name=242:5></a> Nay, we may turn even the love of Christ into our law; we may say, "He has loved me, and done all this for me, and I ought to love him, and do so much for him, in return for this love," etc.<a name=242:6></a> Thus if we turn His love into a rule of life, it becomes the ministration of death; for the only thing a rule can do is to condemn.<a name=242:7></a> With the children of Israel Moses put a veil upon his face, for they could not bear the sight of the glory -- it condemned them.<a name=242:8></a> Man tries either to hide his condemnation from God, or his conscience from His condemnation.<a name=242:9></a> He excludes himself from God -- from the glory of His holiness and from His glory as seen in Jesus; and when His glory shall be revealed in the end, it will only bring out condemnation more fully.<a name=242:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In contrast with this ministration of death and condemnation, we see the ministration of the Spirit and of righteousness.<a name=242:11></a> Now have we this?<a name=242:12></a> It is not Christ down here.<a name=242:13></a> The Holy Ghost here supposes Christ to be gone: and now it is the power of the Spirit of God revealing the glory of Christ to the soul.<a name=242:14></a> What has the Holy Ghost to tell us of Christ?<a name=242:15></a> He reveals Him not only as the pattern of godliness, but as always manifesting grace.<a name=242:16></a> The Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of vile, miserable sinners: and Christ says "him that cometh unto me I will in nowise cast out.<a name=242:17></a>" "They that are whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.<a name=242:18></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The whole life of Jesus was a manifestation of grace.<a name=242:19></a> He laid Himself aside for others.<a name=242:20></a> He gave Himself to all who came to Him.<a name=242:21></a> He "had no time so much as to eat"; in the midst of a world of wickedness He was the perfect manifestation of the goodness of God.<a name=242:22></a> And this was not all.<a name=242:23></a> He died for sin, put Himself under the whole power of God's wrath for sin -- He was laid in the grave -- He ascended into heaven; and sent down the Holy Ghost as a witness to His glory, and as the minister of righteousness.<a name=242:24></a> So it is now God ministering, not requiring.<a name=242:25></a>

		If I am brought to look at Jesus, I can say, He bore my sins -- I did them, but He bore them -- He gave His soul an offering for my sins; He has taken the whole charge of my sin.<a name=243:1></a> I trace my sins up to the cross and there I have done with them.<a name=243:2></a> They are all gone.<a name=243:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Where, then, do I see the glory?<a name=243:4></a> Is it on Sinai; or in the face of Jesus Christ who has put away all those sins which were revealed and condemned at Sinai?<a name=243:5></a> He has entered into heaven, because they are put away.<a name=243:6></a> In Philippians 2 we see Christ in heaven, not only in virtue of the glory of His Person, but because of the work He has accomplished.<a name=243:7></a> "Wherefore also God hath highly exalted him," etc.<a name=243:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are thus able not only to bear the sight of that glory of God, but to rejoice in it.<a name=243:9></a> Our souls rest in it.<a name=243:10></a> We do not ask to have it veiled, but that we may see every ray of it.<a name=243:11></a> Our hearts can satiate themselves there, because it is the testimony to the love of God, and the perfect putting away of sin.<a name=243:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is also the ministration of righteousness.<a name=243:13></a> "Seeing then we have such hope, we use great boldness of speech.<a name=243:14></a>" It is not a little hope here and a little despair there, but it is a message of perfect righteousness to the vilest.<a name=243:15></a> "By the obedience of One many were made righteous.<a name=243:16></a>" Now, it is God putting in fruit, and not requiring righteousness.<a name=243:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		What is the practical effect of this work of Christ received in the heart?<a name=243:18></a> Not to make a man careless about sin.<a name=243:19></a> Not to give him liberty to sin because Christ has borne the wrath due to it.<a name=243:20></a> The last verse shews how we are made this living epistle.<a name=243:21></a> Contemplating Christ we become like Him.<a name=243:22></a> If the Spirit takes of the things of Christ and shews them to me, I can say, "What a Christ I have!<a name=243:23></a>" and there is the spirit of holiness at once.<a name=243:24></a> I long for Christ, and look at Christ, and thus I get like Him.<a name=243:25></a> The very thing which brings an accomplished righteousness to my conscience makes me like Him.<a name=243:26></a> Then, mark, there is no veil on the heart or on the glory.<a name=243:27></a> The Holy Ghost dwelling in us has taken it away.<a name=243:28></a> And it is said of Israel, "When they shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away.<a name=243:29></a>" When Moses went in to the Lord, he always took off the veil; but the children of Israel could not bear the sight of the glory; so he put it on when he appeared to them.<a name=243:30></a><a name=244>[Page 244]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		For believers, there is no veil anywhere.<a name=244:1></a> They can look at the glory because it tells of salvation, not of judgment -- accomplished salvation and effectual righteousness.<a name=244:2></a> What perfect liberty to be in the presence of God and enjoy Christ in all His fulness!<a name=244:3></a> (verse 17).<a name=244:4></a> "The Lord is that Spirit"; that is, Christ is the mind of the Spirit in all these Old Testament things.<a name=244:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then what is the consequence of this ministration of the Spirit?<a name=244:6></a> What follows my knowing that I am the righteousness of God in Christ?<a name=244:7></a> that God delights in me?<a name=244:8></a> I have a constraint upon my heart to serve Him and follow Him.<a name=244:9></a> If I think of His love, have I any fear?<a name=244:10></a> I do fail constantly: has God any afterthought about me, or about my sins?<a name=244:11></a> There is no uncertainty: nothing is between me and God but the love which has placed me there; without spot and in perfect freedom, for He has given Christ for me.<a name=244:12></a> It is now, not God requiring anything from me, but God giving things to me; and this, that His Son may be glorified in me: not that man may be glorified, but His Son Jesus glorified.<a name=244:13></a> God is making a marriage for His Son.<a name=244:14></a> We have to be the epistle of Christ We have this privilege -- to glorify and manifest Christ.<a name=244:15></a> We should be delighted to be this epistle, cost what it may.<a name=244:16></a> Christ died for me, and I have to represent Him.<a name=244:17></a> Of course I may fail, often and again; but the heart at liberty before God will run in the way of His commandments; and this because the affections are set upon God and the glory of Christ.<a name=244:18></a> My life, my daily path, must be an answer to the love of God.<a name=244:19></a> I am debtor to Christ, for He loved me and gave Himself for me.<a name=244:20></a> What an amazing privilege to be permitted to glorify Him in any little way in our path down here!<a name=244:21></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2 Corinthians 4 and 5
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle speaks here of the ministry that he had received.<a name=245:1></a> A man of like passions with us, he was one who in a wonderful manner lived with God so as to carry out this ministry; he laboured more abundantly than they all.<a name=245:2></a> Still what he ministered we receive; only he was a vessel filled in a more than ordinary degree.<a name=245:3></a> But this same blessed truth, as it especially regards the testimony, is committed to us, whatever the measure, whether the greatest as an instrument or the least, and therefore the thing that he ministered is ours; so that we are vessels each one in his own little measure of that with which he was filled.<a name=245:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The ministry of the Spirit, contrasted with that of the Old Testament prophets, shews that the things must be possessed for ourselves before they can be ministered to others.<a name=245:5></a> Now this is not characteristic of the prophetic ministry; for the prophets found that it was not to themselves that they ministered.<a name=245:6></a> There are three steps in 1 Peter 1: 10-13 as to this.<a name=245:7></a> First, the Spirit of Christ which was in the prophets testified beforehand of the sufferings of Christ, and of the glories that should follow.<a name=245:8></a> Next, these things are now reported unto us by the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven, that is, after Christ was glorified.<a name=245:9></a> Then we are to have girded loins and "hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto us at the revelation of Jesus Christ.<a name=245:10></a>" We stand between the sufferings and the glories, with the Holy Ghost sent down, waiting for the revelation of Jesus Christ, in the distinct confession therefore of what the sufferings of Christ have wrought; and our loins are to be girded while here.<a name=245:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle here shews how the testimony is carried out; it is not "thus saith Jehovah," but it is carried out in the place in which we stand as possessing the things ministered.<a name=245:12></a> "God who commanded," etc.<a name=245:13></a>, hath "shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.<a name=245:14></a>" Paul had had a revelation of Christ in him, "when it pleased God to reveal his Son in me.<a name=245:15></a>" The revelation of Christ in him was that by which he might preach Him, and it was not only to him but in him -- this latter of course in a remarkable way; but in every one of us according to our measure.<a name=245:16></a> To Paul it was the revelation of Christ in glory; but He was revealed as Son of God, and this is the character of the testimony.<a name=245:17></a> It is the expression in the power of the Holy Ghost of what we have in Christ.<a name=245:18></a> It is the ministry of the "gospel of the glory of Christ," "the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.<a name=245:19></a>" We may see its character and where it sets us.<a name=245:20></a> God speaks from heaven; it is not law.<a name=245:21></a> His voice then shook the earth: only once more He will shake not earth only but also heaven, so that now we have the last things.<a name=245:22></a> It is the glory he is speaking of in contrast with Moses who put a veil over his face.<a name=245:23></a> His ministry was of death and condemnation, and even that reflection of glory man could not look at, because it came as a legal claim upon man, a demand or exaction from God.<a name=245:24></a> If it had come alone, man might have thought he could stand it; but, accompanied by the glory, it was impossible.<a name=245:25></a> The moment the glory of God, the light of God, shines into a man's heart, the conscience is awakened: the light once there, the man cannot stand in God's presence.<a name=245:26></a> Mount Sinai was the administration of it.<a name=245:27></a> The ministry of the law (2 Corinthians 3) was but the glory of the reflection; all was condemnation, because it was God requiring from men what they ought to be.<a name=245:28></a> Man must either hide himself from God when he hears His voice, or hide God from himself.<a name=245:29></a>

		2 Corinthians 5
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Redemption sets us at rest and in peace in the presence of God.<a name=260:1></a> The whole character of Christian life flows from being brought back to God, and thus we are called to walk with God.<a name=260:2></a> To believe that we are brought back into the presence of God is not presumption; it is faith.<a name=260:3></a> It is presumption to think that we can be saved in any other way.<a name=260:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The character of our life is that of constant dependence on divine power.<a name=260:5></a> If we are "troubled on every side" without being distressed, it must be because the power of God is working.<a name=260:6></a> If "perplexed" without being in despair, it is because the power of God is there.<a name=260:7></a> But then I must hold myself entirely as a dead man as regards nature, and in the possession of a new life in Christ.<a name=260:8></a> "Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body," 2 Corinthians 4: 10.<a name=260:9></a> With Paul the flesh was not allowed to interrupt the power of this divine life, so that it flowed on in an unhindered way.<a name=260:10></a> This is a blessed state, and we should know it in our measure.<a name=260:11></a> Whenever the life is in activity it always rests on its object; while the character of the life is that of perfect obedience and simple dependence.<a name=260:12></a> The obedience of Christ is very different from our thoughts of obedience, which often imply a will opposed to God, and moreover it involves in us much that is to be abstained from, as well as many claims to be yielded to.<a name=260:13></a> With <i>Christ</i> the Father's will was the motive, the only motive for whatever He did or suffered.<a name=260:14></a> Hence the motive I have in acting, as far as I am a new creature, is the doing of God's will.<a name=260:15></a>

		It is an important fact that sacred scripture never tells me to die to sin, for this I never could do.<a name=260:16></a> But the scripture tells me that I am dead, having died with Christ, and this is Christian liberty.<a name=260:17></a> I begin with being dead with Christ.<a name=260:18></a> For I cannot die to sin, when sin is the character of my whole life apart from Christ.<a name=260:19></a> But how then have I this death?<a name=260:20></a> I have <i>another</i> life; I am alive in Christ.<a name=260:21></a> I am to mortify the flesh most surely, but then it is only in the power of this life which I have in Christ that I am able to do that; and God's dealings with us will help us therein.<a name=260:22></a> But when I look at self, this is not faith: I cannot indeed see what the life is which I have got, it is all so marred.<a name=260:23></a> But when by faith I look at Christ, faith's object, I see it all -- love, joy, patience, obedience.<a name=260:24></a> And we are partakers of this life, as Christ said, "Because I live ye shall live also.<a name=260:25></a>" And again, "God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.<a name=260:26></a>" I thus get confidence with Him, and then His perfectness, which shines as light, shews me all my inconsistencies; and the more I see of them in the light of Christ's perfectness, the better.<a name=260:27></a>

		The life that I now live, I live by the faith of the Son of God; and hence I do not measure sin by breaking commandments merely, though that of course is sin, but rather by the presence of the Holy Ghost in me; as it is said, "Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.<a name=262:21></a>" If I grieve the Spirit I lose my discernment, and sin dims my power of sight, and deadens my spiritual senses; so that the Spirit of God is obliged to bring me to the miserable work of being occupied with my sin (as Peter was) instead of being occupied with all that is precious and joyous in Christ.<a name=262:22></a> It is very grievous that, instead of doing the work which it is His delight to do -- even revealing Christ -- He is obliged to reveal our sins to us, till we weep like Peter over our self-confidence and departure from the Lord.<a name=262:23></a> All is manifest unto Christ.<a name=262:24></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are some chapters in Scripture which contain so full and blessed a statement of some great truth of God that they acquire and retain a peculiar hold on the believer's mind.<a name=270:1></a> And though all Scripture is given by inspiration of God and has the same authority, yet this exceptional effect of peculiar passages cannot be blamed, because it is always found to be produced by some chapter which contains a special revelation of God and His ways, or the love of Christ towards us.<a name=270:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The chapter of which I would now speak can scarcely be said to have this character.<a name=270:3></a> But it contains so complete and remarkable a display of the extent and wondrous heights and deplorable depths to which saints may go; of the mighty principles for good or for evil which are at work in those natures, in which they have part in the highest associations on the one hand, and in the lowest degradation on the other; and of the way in which grace acts to give predominancy to good in us -- it presents such a view of the whole working of divine grace to give the perfect result in good and in blessing of the spiritual conflict now going on in us, through the knowledge of good and evil which we acquired in the fall, that I think it may be fruitful to the reader if I unfold it a little practically.<a name=270:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The way in which in this one chapter we find the highest state to which a Christian can be elevated, an exceptional one, no doubt, as an experience, and the lowest condition to which he can fall, and all the practical principles on which the divine work is carried on between these two extremes, is very striking.<a name=270:5></a> In the beginning of the chapter we find a saint in the third heaven, in paradise, where flesh could have no part in apprehension or in communication.<a name=270:6></a> He knew not whether he was in the body or out of the body.<a name=270:7></a> There was no consciousness of human existence in flesh: so he could not tell, nor could he utter, what he had heard when he returned to the consciousness of flesh again.<a name=270:8></a> Such is the saint at the beginning of the chapter.<a name=270:9></a> At the end we find one, perhaps, many fallen into fornication, uncleanness, and lasciviousness, and unrepentant yet of their sins.<a name=270:10></a> What a contrast of the highest heavenly elevation and the lowest carnal degradation!<a name=270:11></a> And the Christian is capable of both.<a name=270:12></a> What a lesson for every saint, as a warning, though he may reach neither extreme; and how suited to give the consciousness of what natures are at work and of the elements which are in conflict in him in his spiritual life down here!<a name=270:13></a> Another part of this chapter will shew us where power alone is to be found to carry him along his path upon the earth in a way consistently with the heavenly good to which he is called.<a name=270:14></a>

		Paul uses a remarkable expression as to himself when speaking of his elevation to the third heaven: "I know a man in Christ.<a name=271:1></a>" A few preliminary thoughts as to the law will facilitate our understanding this expression.<a name=271:2></a> The law gave to man a perfect and divine rule for his conduct upon the earth.<a name=271:3></a> But it never took him up into heaven.<a name=271:4></a> Heavenly beings indeed, such as the angels, act upon the abstract perfection of this divine rule as it is stated by the Lord Himself: they love God with all their heart and their neighbour as themselves.<a name=271:5></a> This is creature perfection.<a name=271:6></a> But it is their nature in which God has maintained them.<a name=271:7></a>

		To prescribe feelings and conduct by law is another thing.<a name=271:8></a> The contents of the law are perfect.<a name=271:9></a> It tells us what the right state of a creature is, and it forbids the wrong that flesh is inclined to.<a name=271:10></a> But why prescribe this?<a name=271:11></a> No doubt obedience is a part of perfection in a creature.<a name=271:12></a> Mere doing right would not suffice for a being subject to God to walk righteously, because God has absolute authority over him.<a name=271:13></a> Thus God can, and (we know) does, prescribe certain particular acts of service to angels; and they obey.<a name=271:14></a> But when a state of soul is prescribed, why is that?<a name=271:15></a> Because it is needed.<a name=271:16></a> It becomes necessary because of the state of the person to whom the command is addressed.<a name=271:17></a> He is otherwise inclined, in danger from other dispositions of doing otherwise.<a name=271:18></a> To command a person to do a thing supposes that he is not doing nor about to do it if without a command.<a name=271:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we add to this that nine of the ten commandments forbid positive sins and evil dispositions, because men are disposed to them, or there were no need to prohibit them, we shall find that the very nature and existence of a law which prescribes the good on God's authority supposes the evil in man's nature which is opposed to it.<a name=271:20></a> This is a deplorable truth, take either aspect of the case.<a name=271:21></a> You cannot command love, that is, produce it by commanding it, and you cannot put out lusts by forbidding them to a nature which has them as nature.<a name=271:22></a> Yet this is what the law does, and must do if God give one.<a name=271:23></a> It proves that what is forbidden is sin, and that it is in man to be forbidden; but it never takes sin away.<a name=271:24></a> It prescribes good in the creature but does not produce it.<a name=271:25></a> It shews what is right on earth in the creature, but how far is it from taking man into heavenly places!<a name=271:26></a> It can have no pretension to this.<a name=271:27></a>

		Man has now by the fall the knowledge of good and evil.<a name=272:1></a> The law acts on this amazing faculty, of which God could say, "the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil.<a name=272:2></a>" But how?<a name=272:3></a> Man is under the evil, and law requires good in him which is not, and shews him all the evil which is in him.<a name=272:4></a> It presses the evil on him and its consequences in judgment, and as to the good it requires in him, it only gives the consciousness that it is not there.<a name=272:5></a> Further, it shews no good to him as an object before his soul.<a name=272:6></a> I repeat, to make the distinction clear, it requires good in him, loving God and his neighbour for example.<a name=272:7></a> But it presents no good to him.<a name=272:8></a> There is no revealed object to produce good nor be man's good in him in living power.<a name=272:9></a> It works therefore wrath.<a name=272:10></a> Where no law is, there is no transgression.<a name=272:11></a>

		Now grace works quite otherwise; it does not require good where it is not, though it may produce good.<a name=272:12></a> It does not condemn the wicked, but forgives and puts away their sin; it presents to us an object, God Himself, but God come near to us in love.<a name=272:13></a> It does more, it communicates what is good.<a name=272:14></a> It is not a law.<a name=272:15></a> It does not require good where it is not, but produces it.<a name=272:16></a> It does not condemn the wicked, but it forgives and puts away their wickedness.<a name=272:17></a> It does not lead us to carry on the conflict between good and evil by pressing the evil on us, and making us feel it a burden not to be got rid of, and ourselves slaves to it, which the law does, making us feel "this body of death" as that under whose power we are, sold to sin, and, supposing we are born again, making us only feel more truly and deeply that even this does not make us meet its requirements so that we should be righteous by it, however much "to will is present with us," but the contrary.<a name=272:18></a> In a word, grace does not, in the knowledge of good and evil with which it deals, lead us to carry on the conflict by the sense of the power and dreadfulness of evil to which we are subject and its consequences, but by the possession of perfect and divine good through which we judge the evil as raised above it, by the possession of an object perfectly good and which is our delight as well as our life, by the possession of Christ -- being in Him and He in us.<a name=272:19></a>

		First, we may remark that no extent of knowledge, even where given of God, is in itself spiritual power in our souls.<a name=279:7></a> We cannot doubt that such revelations as Paul received in the third heaven strengthened his own faith, made him understand that it was well worth sacrificing for it a miserable life, such as this world's is, and gave him a consciousness of what he was contending for, a sense of the divine things he had to do with, which must have exercised an immense influence upon his career in this world.<a name=279:8></a> But it was not immediate power in conflict in the mixed state in which he found himself when he had to speak of "myself Paul.<a name=279:9></a>" He had, and so have we, to walk by faith and not by sight.<a name=279:10></a> The wickedest man would not sin while his mind had the glory of God Himself before his eyes; but that would no way prove the state of his heart and affections when it was removed.<a name=279:11></a> Like Balaam, he would turn to his vomit again.<a name=279:12></a> So in point of fact the Christian, however strengthened and refreshed by times on the road by what is almost like sight to him and by communications of divine love to his soul, has to walk by faith and not always in these sensible apprehensions of divine results in glory.<a name=279:13></a> Not that he is to walk in the flesh or lose communion, but he is not always under the power of especial communications of the glory conferred on him and of divine love to his soul.<a name=279:14></a> Paul knows a man fourteen years ago -- not every day in that state.<a name=279:15></a> He could rejoice in the Lord always.<a name=279:16></a> Some Christians are apt to confound these two things -- special joy and abiding communion, and to suppose, because the first is not always the case the discontinuance of the latter is to be taken for granted and acquiesced in.<a name=279:17></a> This is a great mistake.<a name=279:18></a> Special visitations of joy may be afforded; but constant fellowship with God and with the Lord Jesus is the only right state, the only one recognised in Scripture.<a name=279:19></a> We are to rejoice in the Lord alway.<a name=279:20></a>

		But there are cases where the will and natural reluctance of the flesh to suffer are in question; there are also those which are characterised by the danger of positive evil working, as pride or vanity in the case of Paul.<a name=283:1></a> As to all, death must be tasted.<a name=283:2></a> The nothingness and incompetency of all flesh must be felt where it would be disposed to think itself competent.<a name=283:3></a> It must find its pretensions arrested and set aside when it has such, or would be disposed to have them; it must find itself consciously weak where it might hope to be strong or capable of something.<a name=283:4></a> As to what sell would lean on, it must find itself a hindering flesh where it would pretend to be a helping one.<a name=283:5></a> It is really nothing in the work and path of God; but when it would be positively something, it must be made to feel itself a positive hindrance.<a name=283:6></a> This is not the end, but it is the way.<a name=283:7></a> We must be humbled when we are not humble, or even in danger of not being so.<a name=283:8></a> This work may come in preventively.<a name=283:9></a> But the flesh must be nothing if we are to have blessing; and in order that the new man, which is content that God should be all and knows its power is in Christ only, may be free and happy, and God, as it desires, may be glorified.<a name=283:10></a> The power of Satan and the power of death concur in ministering to our usefulness in Christ, because Satan wields this power to kill practically the flesh, and we have another life which lives in Christ and lives for Him.<a name=283:11></a>

		This question is first settled as regards righteousness, as we have seen.<a name=283:12></a> We are dead and risen again; but it has to be practically settled as regards life and power of walk also.<a name=283:13></a> So that we may say, whatever our little measure may be, "to me to live is Christ.<a name=283:14></a>" But the fact that the flesh is thus practically mortified is not in itself power: we must be positively dependent on another, glad to be so, if our heart is in Christ's service and that we find His help only can make us to serve Him.<a name=283:15></a> To have Him is joy in every way.<a name=283:16></a> This is what follows: "I will glory in my infirmities"; not sin, but what broke down the flesh in its will and hindered sin, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.<a name=283:17></a> Here is positive power capable of everything, of rendering us capable of everything in the path of obedience, giving no power at all out of it, but of fulfilling in power all the energy of love in obedience.<a name=283:18></a> For the Christian path is not mere legal obedience which submits to a will which arrests and stops our will, but an obedience which serves with delight in love and in which love is positively and energetically active in doing good.<a name=283:19></a> This path is regulated by the Lord's will and fulfilled by the Lord's power, but that power can have no adventitious aid.<a name=283:20></a> It must be the strength in us of a dependent nature.<a name=283:21></a> In this is the right condition of the creature, obedience and conscious dependence, and both delighted in, on one who has title and alone has title to all the praise, who loves us and on whose love we lean.<a name=283:22></a>

		In the path of service, the energy of Christ's love impels us, Christ's power sustains and enables us.<a name=284:1></a> Flesh, only a hindrance to that, must be put down, and practically annulled, that Christ may work freely in us according to the blessing of that love.<a name=284:2></a> We then say the love of Christ constrains us.<a name=284:3></a> I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me, the only true abiding state of the Christian, be he babe or father in Christ; only the thing he may have to do may be different and his temptations too.<a name=284:4></a> God in all cases is faithful not to suffer him to be tempted above that he is able.<a name=284:5></a> When a man is in Christ then, redeemed, quickened, and united to the Head, accepted in the Beloved, the work of God in order to power is to break down and bring the flesh to conscious nothingness wherever it is needed; not by mending, using, ameliorating, but, if needed by its will to be something, breaking it down, yea, making it for man's capabilities of acting a sensible hindrance.<a name=284:6></a> This is all that God makes of man as to his flesh and competency; but there is a deep lesson of blessing in it besides being the path of power in service.<a name=284:7></a> We are emptied of self; and Christ (that is, purity, and love, and blessing -- God known to us in grace) becomes everything to us, the more unhindered joy of the soul made practically like Him.<a name=284:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But we become now sensibly dependent, and Christ our power, I do not say sensibly power; for, though there may be a consciousness of His strength, the service and work is done indeed, but done without any conscious strength.<a name=284:9></a> It may be done with joy in communion with Christ, and thus with joy in the service itself.<a name=284:10></a> It may be done with fear and trembling, and hence with no joy though with confidence.<a name=284:11></a> That depends much upon how far we have to meet the sensible power of the enemy, always in weakness as to self, always in confidence as to Christ, though it is His work, and He the doer of it though He may use us as instruments.<a name=284:12></a> And this operation is not merely an effect in us, though there be one; it is the positive power of Christ, a real acting and working of His power, for which the sensible putting down of flesh was only preparatory, that it might be evidently not the power of flesh, and that there might be no mixture of the two in our minds.<a name=284:13></a> Hence the flesh is turned into positive sensible weakness.<a name=284:14></a> But the power of Christ rests upon us, so that it is joy to the soul because He uses us, connects Himself (so to speak) with us, deigns to make us the instruments and servants, willing and rejoicing servants of this power.<a name=284:15></a> It is His power, but it rests on us.<a name=284:16></a> This is not the man in Christ, but Christ with the man -- His power resting on him emptied of self.<a name=284:17></a>

		The path of strength then is the being made sensible of our own weakness, so that divine strength, which will never be a supplement to flesh's strength, may come in.<a name=285:1></a> Thus there is entire dependence, and the positive coming in of Christ's power to work by us.<a name=285:2></a> If Paul's bodily presence was weak, and his speech contemptible, and there was something which tended to make him despised, by whose power was it that such wondrous blessing for the whole world flowed forth on all sides from Jerusalem round about unto Illyricum?<a name=285:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One or two remarks more, and I will close my imperfect suggestions on this chapter.<a name=285:4></a> First remark that the humbling process with Paul was no depriving of the abundance of the revelations, or weakening the consciousness that he was a man in Christ.<a name=285:5></a> This would have been positive loss.<a name=285:6></a> These were fully maintained and gloried in.<a name=285:7></a> The use the flesh would make of them when consciously down here in the body, in the world, was met by an accessory humbling process carried on in the flesh itself.<a name=285:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next remark that it is not merely power which is gained by this process.<a name=285:9></a> The discernment of good and evil, in its more subtle characters, is greatly increased; the judgment and knowledge of flesh greatly strengthened and deepened.<a name=285:10></a> Hence the liberty of the new man with God, confidence in Him, the sense of the careful and gracious interest He takes in us, and intercourse founded on this confidence, are greatly increased.<a name=285:11></a> Further remark, that dealing with self, our own spiritual condition, is the secret of power, not the quantity of divine revelations we have to communicate, valuable as that may be in its place.<a name=285:12></a> For power Paul was dealt with in his own soul, its own dangers and state, and then Christ's power rested on him.<a name=285:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Lastly note, that our glorying in our position in Christ is all right.<a name=286:1></a> "Of such an one I will glory; yet of myself I will not glory but in mine infirmities.<a name=286:2></a>" When I think of my place in Christ, of the "man in Christ," of such an one we ought to glory.<a name=286:3></a> This is no presumption.<a name=286:4></a> It cannot be otherwise, whenever we know ourselves in Christ.<a name=286:5></a> Do you think I can do anything but glory in being in Christ, and like Christ in glory?<a name=286:6></a> Of such an one I will.<a name=286:7></a> Let no pretended humility deprive us of this.<a name=286:8></a> It is legalism.<a name=286:9></a> Of myself, of that of which I have the living consciousness as a man down here, I cannot glory, unless it be in those sufferings for Christ and infirmities, of whatever kind they may be, connected with them, which are used to put the flesh down, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.<a name=286:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would add to these one collateral observation.<a name=286:11></a> The Lord can unite discipline with positive suffering for Christ, though the two things are quite distinct.<a name=286:12></a> When Paul was subjected to contempt in his preaching it was for Christ's sake he suffered, yet the form of it was, we have seen, a discipline to prevent his being puffed up.<a name=286:13></a> This may be seen doctrinally in Hebrews 12: 2-11.<a name=286:14></a> In verses 2-4 we suffer with Christ, striving against sin, even to martyrdom and death.<a name=286:15></a> In verses 5-11 the same process is the discipline of the Lord, that we may be partakers of His holiness.<a name=286:16></a> How wise and most gracious of the Lord's ways to turn our needed discipline into the privilege of suffering for Christ's sake, so that we can glory in our infirmities!<a name=286:17></a> There is chastening which has not this character, being for positive evil.<a name=286:18></a> In this doubtless we have to thank God, but it is another thing.<a name=286:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In fine, before God we have the "man in Christ" -- blessed position -- which is perfection where we want it; and as to our place before men, besides Christ in us as life, the power of Christ, where we practically want it, in weakness and imperfection down here, resting on the man for walk and service before men.<a name=286:20></a> The first is the basis of all our walk, but it does not suffice for power.<a name=286:21></a> This is had in daily dependence in which we walk, as humbled in ourselves, that Christ may be glorified, and the flesh practically annulled.<a name=286:22></a>

		We need to be taught of God, what this "man in Christ" means.<a name=286:23></a> When we speak of a man in the flesh or a man in the Spirit, we mean his state or position; what characterises him before God.<a name=286:24></a> A man in Christ does not mean what he is in himself.<a name=286:25></a> It is the condition of every child of God "in Christ.<a name=286:26></a>" This chapter, in what follows, shews us much of what flesh is; but in this state -- "in Christ," flesh had nothing to do with it.<a name=286:27></a> The body had nothing to do with it.<a name=286:28></a> Paul could not understand it of himself.<a name=286:29></a> He says, "I knew a man in Christ, whether in the body I cannot tell," etc.<a name=286:30></a>; that is, it is not what he was as a man down here.<a name=286:31></a> It is the position of a believer contrasted with that of an unbeliever.<a name=286:32></a> "If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature.<a name=286:33></a>" This characterises him, and the value and import of it are unfolded in that passage.<a name=286:34></a> And again, "Ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you.<a name=286:35></a> Now if any man has not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.<a name=286:36></a> And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin.<a name=286:37></a>" It is quite evident it has nothing to do with anything he has out of Christ.<a name=286:38></a> Whatever he was before, he was in flesh; now he is in Christ, and all is measured by Christ: he has got his place in the second Adam, and not in the first.<a name=286:39></a> It will shew itself in its practical ways, but this refers to his standing.<a name=286:40></a>

		The way in which the law is placed in contrast with promise and faith in Galatians 3 is very striking.<a name=299:1></a> It is not merely that man is a sinner and that there is a judgment (a truth so solemnly revealed in Scripture), nor is it the operation of the law, experimentally known as spiritually bringing death into the conscience, as we find it opened out in Romans 7.<a name=299:2></a> The law and promise in grace are brought before us as two systems, both of God, but contrasted in their nature and opposite in their effects, and absolutely exclusive one of the other; existing at separate times, though the second could not disannul the first, and whose co-existence, as the ground of man's standing with God, is in their very nature impossible.<a name=299:3></a> Both are positive dealings and revealed ways of God with man, each of its own kind.<a name=299:4></a> Man had been turned out of paradise for sin, and he is an outcast from God and all intercourse with Him, such as he once had upon earth.<a name=299:5></a> This is his state; but it is no special revelation to him in that state.<a name=299:6></a> A judgment<a href="#299:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> awaits him too.<a name=299:7></a> This will hereafter shew God's righteous way with sin, and natural conscience bears the reflex of it within, in spite of all the sinner's efforts to get rid of it.<a name=299:8></a> It is to come, however; not a present dealing with man or a revelation by which he is placed in a special relationship with God according to the terms of that revelation.<a name=299:9></a> He has to answer as a fallen sinner for his conduct -- terrible but righteous truth!<a name=299:10></a> but he is in no present revealed relationship with God.<a name=299:11></a> Not so where the promise or the law has come in.<a name=299:12></a> Then man has as a present thing to do with God according to the terms revealed by Him.<a name=299:13></a> These are of two kinds, as here brought forward -- promise and law; only we have to add, that the Seed to whom the promise was made is now come, and has accomplished the work of redemption for the heirs according to promise.<a name=299:14></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#299:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>It is well to remark here, that judgment is always and necessarily condemnation, whenever it is entered into so as to pronounce on the acceptance, or otherwise, of a man in consequence of his conduct. For this reason God cannot judge His own work, as He created it. It would be judging His own competency as a workman or Creator. He saw it all, and behold it was very good. Now, if man has left his first estate and got away into sin by self-will, and has thus given occasion to the existence of judgment on him, what can judgment be but condemnation? That is, there is no judgment if man be not departed from the state God put him in. If he be, judgment as such must be condemnation. What grace may do is another thing. Hence the really awakened conscience says, Enter NOT into judgment with thy servant, O Lord, for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.

		The Galatians were not rejecting the promise or Christ; but they were adding the law to Christ as completing God's will.<a name=300:1></a> This it is that the apostle resists, and declares the incompatibility of the two.<a name=300:2></a> Not that the law was against the promises (for if a law had been given which could have given life, righteousness would have been by it); but that the one system was in fact opposite in its principle to the other.<a name=300:3></a> They were two distinct ways proposed for having life, righteousness, and the inheritance.<a name=300:4></a> One brings a curse and nothing else; the other a blessing after God's own heart, and nothing else.<a name=300:5></a> One is founded on man's responsibility, the other on God's gift, when man had failed altogether under that responsibility.<a name=300:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		First, then, as to the contrast, they did not obey the truth as to the cross if they annexed the law to Christ.<a name=300:8></a> The law applied to life in the flesh and its obligations.<a name=300:9></a> The cross declares its condemnation and end in death, and death to it.<a name=300:10></a> They had not received the Spirit by law but by faith.<a name=300:11></a> They had had the Spirit, had begun in it when they had not the law at all, and they were now looking to be made perfect through the latter, but this was by the flesh; for the law supposed flesh to be alive and applied to it.<a name=300:12></a> Further, he who shewed the power of the Spirit, and ministered it, did it, not by the works of the law but by the report of faith.<a name=300:13></a> But it was admitted by the few that the blessing was in Abraham.<a name=300:14></a> But he got it by faith, and was counted righteous by it without any law at all -- not only without it, but on a contrary principle.<a name=300:15></a> They which are of faith (that is, who stand on this principle before God) are blessed with faithful, that is, believing Abraham.<a name=300:16></a> Now the law is not on this principle.<a name=300:17></a> The law is not of faith but on the principle of doing -- getting the blessing by doing.<a name=300:18></a> But that is not faith.<a name=300:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And remark more than this: not only is the blessing by faith, not by law, not on this principle, and the accomplishment by oneself or another of the law, but as many as are on this principle -- as many as stand on the ground of their obligation to keep the law -- are under the curse.<a name=300:20></a> "As many as are of the works of the law are under the curse.<a name=300:21></a>" The works of the law are not bad works; they are right works, loving God and our neighbour, and not breaking the commandments which forbid sin.<a name=300:22></a> But they that are of the works of the law (that is, that are placed or place themselves under the obligation of the law, of doing these works) are under the curse.<a name=300:23></a> He does not say he who has broken the law, he who sins, he who has done evil, but he who is of the works of the law, who goes upon the principle of being under its obligation, and bound to accomplish it, is under the curse.<a name=300:24></a>

		Nor is there a hint of any one's keeping it for us, so that we should not be under the curse when we are under the law.<a name=301:1></a> All that are of the works of the law ARE under the curse; because, according to its declaration, everyone is so that has not kept it.<a name=301:2></a> And no man under it has kept it, for he is in flesh; and this is not subject to it nor can be.<a name=301:3></a> He must get off this ground to escape its curse.<a name=301:4></a> But this can be only by death.<a name=301:5></a> The Jew was under it, and all else would have been condemned as lawless had they not come under it then; but, for every one who believed of those who were, Christ took the curse on the cross.<a name=301:6></a> It is not pretended that He kept it for them, so that the curse was not needed for their breaking it, because another had kept it for them, for then He had not needed to bear its curse.<a name=301:7></a> No: the curse of its head remained there and was borne on the cross; and thus they were redeemed from it, and then, the whole system of God under law being closed and the middle wall of partition broken down, the blessing of Abraham (which was of faith) could flow forth on the Gentiles who had faith.<a name=301:8></a> It could not till then.<a name=301:9></a> While God maintained the obligation of the law as a dispensed system among men, the Gentile must have submitted to it and become a Jew as to law if not as to race, he must have submitted to its obligation, while God maintained it.<a name=301:10></a> But the dispensation of law had now closed by the death of Christ, and the blessing of the promise by faith could flow forth to them who believed.<a name=301:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This brings forward another point in the argument: the historical part of it.<a name=301:12></a> A subsequent act cannot disannul, even amongst men, a solemnly confirmed covenant.<a name=301:13></a> Now God had given the promise to Abraham without law, and confirmed it to Christ 430 years before the law came.<a name=301:14></a> This therefore could not disannul the previously confirmed promise, nor alter its terms.<a name=301:15></a> It could not be disannulled, and it could not be added to.<a name=301:16></a> It must be fulfilled as it was given.<a name=301:17></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#302:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>The following verses, which often perplex readers, when viewed in connection with this are easy to understand. God is one: the promise was to Christ the Seed. Its fulfilment depended therefore only on God.

Hence it did not rest simply on God's faithfulness to His promise, but on man's obedience.

		<a class="footnote" name="#303:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>It may be well for the reader to remark that "we" is often used for Jews here as in other parts of scripture. They were under the curse of the law. Christ was made a curse for them (Jewish believers) that the blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles. The legal curse being done away, which was connected with Jews and the law, the original promise could flow freely out on Gentiles that we (Jewish and Gentile believers) might receive the Spirit. <p>Hence in verse 23 he says, We were kept under the law; but in verse 26, Ye are all the children of God, for the Gentiles were too. The law had run up to the cross and the curse, but could go no farther. The promise and blessing flowed forth on Jew and Gentile through faith. Hence the statement of verses 27-29. So in the beginning of Ephesians 2. If any one now puts himself under law, they put themselves under the curse; for the law is not an arbitrary enactment, but a real moral one, so that its judgment is felt to be righteous in the conscience. But then it is condemnation and death, and there is no hope at all. They are fallen from grace. Christ is become of no effect for them. So far is He from fulfilling the law for us when we break it, that, for him who is under it, Christ is become of no effect.

		This was an immense fact.<a name=305:1></a> It is not man responsible and liable to judgment.<a name=305:2></a> It is not merely grace working, so that a man may have, individually, share in divine life, and divine favour, and heaven; but one called publicly out from the whole system of God, and made the head of a race (now a spiritual one), and all blessing deposited in him, and wholly in him.<a name=305:3></a> This was a new thing on the earth.<a name=305:4></a> In a general way one may look at Israel as the natural seed according to the promise, but the details of that part of the history need not detain us here.<a name=305:5></a> They were according to flesh, and the seed of promise was definitely to be accounted heir.<a name=305:6></a>

		But the obedience of Christ, spotless and blameless under law as He had been, went infinitely farther than law, and indeed was on another principle.<a name=308:1></a> It was the voluntary surrender of self and life to glorify God.<a name=308:2></a> That self and life, which law would direct, and the love of which became the measure of love to others, was wholly given up.<a name=308:3></a> The curse and wrath due under law and to sin were undergone.<a name=308:4></a> "Therefore," could Christ say, "doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life that I might take it again.<a name=308:5></a>" Of this the law knew nothing.<a name=308:6></a> It was absolute obedience in the total surrender and devotedness of self to God's glory and purposes and our salvation.<a name=308:7></a> And God was glorified in Him: God was, and hence God has glorified Him in Himself.<a name=308:8></a> And man is entered into the glory which the Son had with the Father before the world was, and is entered righteously.<a name=308:9></a> God has displayed His righteousness in setting Christ, the man who had glorified Him, at His right hand.<a name=308:10></a> Thus divine righteousness is established in giving Christ the glory which He deserved through His work for us.<a name=308:11></a> But then we must be in this place of glory, for it was for us He did it, and He must see of the travail of His soul in bringing into His own glory those whom His Father had given Him.<a name=308:12></a> We wait therefore for the hope of righteousness by faith, the hope that belongs to righteousness; and what that is we see in the glory into which Christ has entered, where the righteousness of God has placed Him as man.<a name=308:13></a>

		Thus grace could reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=308:14></a> It was a glorifying God in the giving up Himself, and that to death, and the curse, and wrath, through the Eternal Spirit offering Himself up without spot to God, and God in righteousness setting Him in glory at His right hand.<a name=308:15></a> Thus man took this place in righteousness, according to the purpose of God, we being made sharers therein by grace; and now, having seen the full result in glory founded on righteousness through Christ, let us see what the blessing is.<a name=308:16></a>

		This blessedness we have in the present sense of divine love; the love of God shed abroad in our hearts; God dwelling in us and we in Him; the consciousness, through the Holy Ghost, that we are in Christ and Christ in us; in the consciousness that we are sons, through the Spirit of His Son sent forth into our hearts, crying, Abba Father; the looking for glory, to be like Him and with Him; the consciousness of the Father's love resting on us as on Jesus.<a name=309:1></a> More than the promise of the Father to Christ, shewing His love to the Son, and having our place in Him before the Father and enjoying His own love, we cannot think of.<a name=309:2></a> God has made Christ as Man, and us in Christ, the pattern of what His blessing in love is.<a name=309:3></a> As it was said of Joseph, "In thee shall Israel bless, God make thee like Ephraim and Manasseh.<a name=309:4></a>"

		There is righteousness, but not man's, under the law, whoever has accomplished it, but God's in setting Christ at His right hand in glory, who had given up Himself and all promised, as come in the flesh, for God the Father's glory, according to the everlasting purpose of blessing and displaying Himself in blessing; of which Christ, the promised Seed, first of all was the object; then, if we are Christ's, we also are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to promise.<a name=309:13></a> And how the divine Person of Christ comes out to view in this!<a name=309:14></a> For God, in a certain sense, was debtor to Him for the maintenance of His glory -- yea, for the only full bringing it out in redemption.<a name=309:15></a> So that, as we have seen, He righteously enters into it as man.<a name=309:16></a> But to whom can God be debtor in any sense?<a name=309:17></a> Who can make a "therefore" for God to act upon or love?<a name=309:18></a> But Christ in the divine counsels has.<a name=309:19></a>

		SOVEREIGN GRACE IN CHRIST

	<div class="paragraph">
		Ephesians 1
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two ways in which we may look at our relationship to God, and rightly: firstly, our coming to Him; and secondly, sovereign grace in the dealings of God towards us.<a name=311:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Of Abel, it is said, by the Holy Spirit, God had respect unto his gifts; he came with his needed offering.<a name=311:2></a> We are looked at in the Epistle to the Hebrews as drawing near to God.<a name=311:3></a> Who could draw near unless he could bring Christ as an offering?<a name=311:4></a> We must have that sacrifice in order to bring us near; consequently in that case our relationship to God is measured by our need.<a name=311:5></a> We come near because we find we cannot do without it, and we accept that offering as needful to accomplish it.<a name=311:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In another way we never know the measure of God's blessing until we look on our relationship as measured by God's thoughts of us -- by all that which He loves to display when He satisfies His own heart of grace with His ways of shewing it out.<a name=311:7></a> We never enjoy our true blessing unless we see how He thus feels and acts.<a name=311:8></a> My mind must rise above what I am to what God is; then it is that one is formed by the revelation of what God is.<a name=311:9></a> To this we are called.<a name=311:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We must come in by our need, as the prodigal did.<a name=311:11></a> Man cannot by searching find out God.<a name=311:12></a> There cannot be any knowledge of God in grace by man's competency to know Him.<a name=311:13></a> There would be no need of grace if he could know God without it.<a name=311:14></a> If I can claim this grace, I do not need grace at all.<a name=311:15></a> The way a sinner must come in must be by his need.<a name=311:16></a> Thus must one begin to learn grace and love.<a name=311:17></a> But when I have got to God, it is another thing.<a name=311:18></a> Then He would form our minds and hearts by what He is Himself.<a name=311:19></a> I come as a sinner, because I need it -- just as a hungry man needs food; but when brought I have fellowship with the God who has brought me to Himself.<a name=311:20></a> The measure is given in this epistle -- "growing up into Christ, in all things.<a name=311:21></a>" It is a wonderful thing that God has called us into fellowship with Himself -- to have the same thoughts, the same feelings as God, and to have them together!<a name=311:22></a> All flows down from Him, and we are brought into it by grace, and we enjoy it just so far as we are emptied of self.<a name=311:23></a>

	<div class="heading">
		PART 1
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two ways in which we may approach the gospel of the grace of God: firstly, the conscience convicted, and seeing how God has met the condition of man, as in Romans 1-3; and, secondly, the counsels of God from which it all flows.<a name=344:1></a> We may trace Him up from the poor sinner in his need, or we may see the grace from Him flowing down.<a name=344:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this chapter we have much of God's thoughts about Christ Himself, as in Hebrews 1, where He is presented to us as "heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds," etc.<a name=344:3></a>, "upholding all things by the word of his power," "when he had by himself purged our sins.<a name=344:4></a>" It begins with this wonderful counsel of God in grace coming to meet the need, notwithstanding all He was in Himself.<a name=344:5></a> In the chapter before us in Colossians we have the glory of this work in Christ; then its extent is shewn; and what is so precious is that when we begin at the other end (conscience and the sense of need) we reach the same point; but there is a fulness and a strength gathered in looking at the place and purpose of God from all eternity, beyond what we get from the need of the sinner being met.<a name=344:6></a> It is quite needful in whatever way it is brought to us, that the conscience should be reached, because God cannot reveal His glory to unawakened man.<a name=344:7></a> Understanding must come through the conscience, as in the case of the woman of Samaria.<a name=344:8></a> Her spiritual knowledge was gained through the exercise of her soul with Jesus.<a name=344:9></a> Where there is not a living work in the conscience, there never can be a link between the soul and the living person of the Son of God.<a name=344:10></a> This always is the beginning.<a name=344:11></a> The word of God reaches the conscience, and sets it in the presence of the living God.<a name=344:12></a> He has made that one step essential to the sinner.<a name=344:13></a> This woman heard the Lord speaking to herself.<a name=344:14></a> That is the all-important thing, and there can be no truth in the soul till then.<a name=344:15></a> What is all the Bible worth to me if my soul is a stranger to God?<a name=344:16></a> If we bring in all the purposes of God, then they must bear upon the conscience this way.<a name=344:17></a> A sense of God's love to the soul, etc.<a name=344:18></a>, will never be truly realised till it is apprehended as flowing downwards from His glory.<a name=344:19></a>

		We will look into these verses which succeed the prayer relating to the saints' growth in grace, etc.<a name=345:1></a> (verse 12) (for it is well for sinners to see the state of the saints, if only to know that they are not saints), "Giving thanks unto the Father," etc.<a name=345:2></a> Here is the certain settled knowledge of being fit for the inheritance of the saints in light.<a name=345:3></a> Then we are fit for heavenly glory!<a name=345:4></a> This made us fit for that.<a name=345:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(1) The extent and nature of this fitness -- made light in the Lord.<a name=345:6></a> "Ye were darkness, but now are ye light": and there is the full consciousness of it, for there is thanksgiving.<a name=345:7></a> The saints themselves have that knowledge and apprehension of being fit.<a name=345:8></a> See the condition of the saints -- "Delivered from the power of Satan, and translated into the kingdom of God's dear Son.<a name=345:9></a>" The Christian, can say, I was darkness but am now in the place of Christ as to my standing before God.<a name=345:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(2) The means by which we have been brought into this condition: "Through his blood"; and not only redemption, but the sins forgiven.<a name=345:11></a> I was a slave, but am now a redeemed soul in the kingdom of the Son.<a name=345:12></a> It is accomplished between Him and the Father; a settled thing in bringing a poor lost sinner and setting him in the presence of God.<a name=345:13></a> Had I any part in it?<a name=345:14></a> No.<a name=345:15></a> He did it through His blood.<a name=345:16></a> When we simply believe, we always know it is by Christ's blood we are purged.<a name=345:17></a> You may not be sure you are a believer; I do not ask you if you know this: but do you believe that Jesus is the Son of God?<a name=345:18></a> If the soul rests on Jesus, there is not a cloud; but if on yourself, you may well be uncertain, because you have got into the mud of your own hearts.<a name=345:19></a> But in Jesus there is nothing but blessedness: light, nothing but light; every step of His path perfect light.<a name=345:20></a> Faith is believing what Christ Himself is; therefore it immediately breaks out in this passage about the glorious object, "Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature.<a name=345:21></a>" There are distinct parts of Christ's glory here brought out.<a name=345:22></a> The Lord Jesus created all, and therefore He is the Head of all; not only as Adam having dominion, and everything brought to him to name, but "by him were all things created"; and He must be above everything and everybody: "dominions, principalities, powers," etc.<a name=345:23></a> Then there is another character of headship in verse 18: "Firstborn from the dead.<a name=345:24></a>" None could go lower than death, but we see Him going down into it, and rising up from it, and He fills all things.<a name=345:25></a> Everything is created by Him and for Him; and, mark, He takes them as man.<a name=345:26></a> "What is man?<a name=345:27></a>" etc.<a name=345:28></a> (Psalm 8).<a name=345:29></a> Mark another thing also in this verse 18.<a name=345:30></a> He is Head of His body, the church; she is His helpmate, His bride.<a name=345:31></a>

		The next thing is, we find His inheritance defiled -- God dishonoured -- the world ruined -- and man guilty!<a name=346:1></a> The angels have not kept their first estate above, and man has not kept his state below -- none have kept it.<a name=346:2></a> But He must be glorified in bringing it all back again, and the first thing was for God to be honoured, for He has been dishonoured; therefore He must make peace through the blood of His cross.<a name=346:3></a> In making atonement there were in the type two goats to be taken, one lot for the Lord, and one for the people.<a name=346:4></a> The goat on which the Lord's lot fell was to be offered for a sin-offering; but the goat on which the lot fell on behalf of the people had to be presented alive before the Lord, so as to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness; and that goat was to bear upon him all their iniquities into a land not inhabited; and he shall let go the goat into the wilderness.<a name=346:5></a> Has God been glorified then?<a name=346:6></a> Yes, fully glorified, God's requirements more than met.<a name=346:7></a> And who do I find has come in to repair the breach?<a name=346:8></a> It is the Son of His love.<a name=346:9></a> I find it all done.<a name=346:10></a> And where could God ever have been glorified as in the work of His Son?<a name=346:11></a> He glorified God.<a name=346:12></a> "I have glorified thee on the earth.<a name=346:13></a>" Could Adam have so glorified Him in Paradise?<a name=346:14></a> Such love for a sinner could only have been shewn in the redemption of man.<a name=346:15></a> The mercy-seat is sprinkled with blood.<a name=346:16></a> God's lot, not the people's lot, is a token of perfect peace being made with God through the blood of the cross: yes, everything reconciled in heaven and in earth: it does not say under the earth, that is not mentioned here.<a name=346:17></a> Thus we have the basis of everything ransomed to be with God and for God for ever and ever.<a name=346:18></a> It can never stand on creation title; though heaven and earth will stand in the presence of God, but it will be in redemption title alone.<a name=346:19></a> "We, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth.<a name=346:20></a>"

		Besides the Person of the Lord coming out fully in this chapter as Head of His body the church, and Creator of all things, the main subject that is developed in the epistle is life, much more in its detail than in the Ephesians, where we have rather the glories of the church of God in contrast with the previous heathen, or even Jewish, state.<a name=349:1></a> Here, in Colossians, it is the life of Christ in us, and does not go as far in regard to privileges.<a name=349:2></a> The apostle gives us the saints risen with Christ, and then takes this life and shews what it is.<a name=349:3></a> But in doing so he puts the Christian fully in his place with God in that life.<a name=349:4></a> The Christian is taken as indeed risen, but yet on the earth, just simply having life yet not sitting in heavenly places.<a name=349:5></a> He puts the Christian in the power of resurrection, and the life of Christ in resurrection in the Christian.<a name=349:6></a> But heaven is looked at still as a matter of hope: you are looking up to it -- "your life is hid with Christ in God"; but you are not seated there yet; whereas in Ephesians we are there in Christ.<a name=349:7></a> In Colossians he looks at what the power of that life is, and the Christian as risen put in this place before God; and then he shews the power of this life in the details of daily life.<a name=349:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him.<a name=349:9></a>" The knowledge which we have in this new life is renewed after the image of God Himself.<a name=349:10></a> A life has come in which has overcome the world, and I get into the new place which Christ is in as man before God.<a name=349:11></a> Thus we have Christ's place, but still down here; then what the power and character of that life are practically, as passing through this world just as Christ did.<a name=349:12></a> He was properly a heavenly man passing through the world, overcoming everything, and having all His joy in His Father, and He puts us into that life, both as to its acceptance and as to its power.<a name=349:13></a> (You do not get here all the privileges that flow from it.<a name=349:14></a>) Consequently the only proper place of one looked at as risen with Christ is the place He has before God.<a name=349:15></a>

		There are three ways in which Christ's coming is put before our souls in Scripture.<a name=360:21></a> First, it is the fulfilment of our hope.<a name=360:22></a> We are waiting, our bodies to be raised, when we are to see Him and be like Him.<a name=360:23></a> This gives a strong living link that takes the heart out of present things -- one object before our souls, a living Man who is coming again.<a name=360:24></a> We are really waiting for something: for what?<a name=360:25></a> For the Person who has so loved us.<a name=360:26></a> This is connected with two great systems, the government of God, and the church of God.<a name=360:27></a>

		Government under Christ is going to be set up.<a name=361:1></a> All things are to be put under His feet.<a name=361:2></a> This applies to the appearing of the New Testament, the day of the Lord, if you look at it as to wrath -- "the brightness of his coming.<a name=361:3></a>" I shall be happy long before that.<a name=361:4></a> Why then do I long for His appearing?<a name=361:5></a> Because Christ will then have His rights.<a name=361:6></a> It will be the setting up of divine power in goodness, the setting up of divine righteousness too in goodness.<a name=361:7></a> This will be the liberty of glory.<a name=361:8></a> We have the liberty of grace now, but not His glory.<a name=361:9></a> We wait for that.<a name=361:10></a> The great centre of all is Christ taking His rights.<a name=361:11></a> He has not these now.<a name=361:12></a> He has all His personal glory; but He will come in His own glory and in His Father's and of the holy angels.<a name=361:13></a> This is the heavenly part of the government of God, but there is that on earth also which will be the manifestation of God's power to put everything in order where Christ has been crucified and cast out.<a name=361:14></a>

		Government also applies to the church, to the saints.<a name=361:15></a> Are we not under government?<a name=361:16></a> To be sure we are responsible.<a name=361:17></a> If we know to do good and do it not, we are guilty.<a name=361:18></a> We are to walk even as He walked.<a name=361:19></a> He was the display of divine life in a man.<a name=361:20></a> Not merely is there in Him the perfectness of a man before God, but the perfectness of God before man: therefore His example is far more than the law for us.<a name=361:21></a> Another thing is the Holy Ghost given.<a name=361:22></a> We are responsible for gifts bestowed by the Holy Ghost (as in the parable of the talents).<a name=361:23></a> If I have any service as a Christian, I must do it or I shall be chastened.<a name=361:24></a> He takes away what He has given if I do not use it.<a name=361:25></a> All this is connected with government.<a name=361:26></a> As His sons we are all alike saved; liable to judgment as regards our wrong ways, but in blessedness.<a name=361:27></a> The "day of the Lord" will be deliverance for all those waiting for Him.<a name=361:28></a> There will be the display of all previously gone through.<a name=361:29></a> We shall appear with Him.<a name=361:30></a> We always find responsibility connected with the appearing.<a name=361:31></a>

		Another, third thing, entirely distinct, is connected with the church's proper blessedness.<a name=361:32></a> He has taken it up and given it that same place as Himself.<a name=361:33></a> We are wrapped up with Christ as part of Himself -- entirely outside, or rather inside, the question of His kingdom.<a name=361:34></a> No question of government as to that, but the outgoing of the heart of Christ -- loved as Himself.<a name=361:35></a> It is as connected with this we are caught up to meet Him -- His heart identified with mine -- not a thought moving His heart that does not touch mine.<a name=361:36></a> This promise is given us in John 14.<a name=361:37></a> "I will come and receive you.<a name=361:38></a>" There is no thought of anything to do with the world, judgment, or government there, but one single thing, "I will come and receive you unto myself.<a name=361:39></a>" The secondary and inferior thing is the inheritance that we shall have.<a name=361:40></a>

		Caught up into the Father's house first, we get the inheritance as Christ, and with Christ.<a name=362:1></a> "We have borne the image of the earthy," and we "shall also bear the image of the heavenly"; no question of degrees of blessedness or rewards, but all conformed to His image -- He the "firstborn of many brethren.<a name=362:2></a>" The next thing is, we come into the Father's delight, as Christ is -- loved with the same love as He is (the full enjoyment in immediate presence); it is given us now in spirit -- "thou hast loved them as thou hast loved me.<a name=362:3></a>" We shall enjoy this blessedness along with Christ Himself, and be with Him for ever.<a name=362:4></a> "So shall we ever be with the Lord," 1 Thessalonians 4.<a name=362:5></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The consequence of all this is, that when He comes forth, the church, as the "armies which were in heaven," come with Him.<a name=362:14></a> They must be with Him before they come with Him.<a name=362:15></a> How have they got with Him?<a name=362:16></a> When He rises up from His present place, we shall go too.<a name=362:17></a> He is now hid in God, so are we.<a name=362:18></a> He is our life.<a name=362:19></a> When He shall appear, we shall also appear with Him in glory.<a name=362:20></a> He comes out, the Rider on the white horse, and we come with Him.<a name=362:21></a> We have the same portion as Himself.<a name=362:22></a> We are still waiting; but He is coming to take things into His hands.<a name=362:23></a> At His appearing everything must be in order.<a name=362:24></a> He cannot be in a world where all is disorder and going on in wilfulness.<a name=362:25></a> That will be "the day" -- the display of His power; but besides and within this we have our own portion.<a name=362:26></a>

		PROMISE OF LIFE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Titus 1
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is at the beginning of this chapter that the Spirit of God marks with an especial character that on which I desire to speak -- the eternal thought of God towards us which we find in verses 2, 3.<a name=364:1></a> Evil had come in, the Spirit takes notice of it, and the effect in a most remarkable way is to throw us back on the whole mind and thought of God from the beginning.<a name=364:2></a> As evil progresses and corruption comes in, the apostle turns back to the origin of all, and coming from the divine nature itself (and all that could meet the evil, and convey us on, must come from that); that is, the eternal life which God who cannot lie promised before the ages of time; <i>that</i> which was in the mind of God as to the thing itself before the foundation of the world; <i>that</i> which God had in His mind, the counsel of God for us, before itself was created.<a name=364:3></a> It just shews us what we are, and what man is, with and apart from that eternal life.<a name=364:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Ephesians we find it in connection with Christ (chapter 3: 3-7): a mystery hidden through all ages in God until Christ was raised up as Head of the body, the bride.<a name=364:5></a> It is not on this I would dwell.<a name=364:6></a> I am not going to speak about the church, but would turn back to what the life is and would dwell on this thought, the promise of life in the mind of God before the world began.<a name=364:7></a> Before that, I say, this life existed in a Person, <i>Christ</i>, the One who was in the beginning with God and was God; <i>that</i> is the Christ with whom my life is hidden with the Father.<a name=364:8></a> Being in Himself life, He came into the world as the life and manifested the life.<a name=364:9></a> The thing was embodied in the Person of the Lord as Man, and there it was, the life of man, not of angels: that which was specially God's divine thought towards man is shewn out when Christ becomes Man, and this life is communicated to us, the instrument used being the preached word of truth.<a name=364:10></a> This divine life had been manifested here in a man -- the Lord Jesus.<a name=364:11></a> He having given it to us, it is now manifested in our bodies.<a name=364:12></a> It has the character of godliness in its manifestation.<a name=364:13></a> It tells you what you are.<a name=364:14></a> It is in a poor vessel and where there is a wretched will, but it tells you what you are and what the world is; it throws out an additional light to shew what man is, as a creature totally departed from God.<a name=364:15></a>

		Morally speaking, the world has grown up in departure from God: that is, this world we live in -- all that we see around -- has sprung up from the creature having got away from God, but the life we have existed before the creation of the world, and this portion of Scripture is very full of the simple, quiet blessedness of what that life is, practically manifested and given in Christ.<a name=365:1></a> A great deal of evil had come in.<a name=365:2></a> Satan was corrupting the truth by the wild reasoning of man's mind.<a name=365:3></a> The apostle specially warns Timothy and Titus, and throws them back, not on common Christian profession, but on the faith of God's elect, the acknowledging the truth which is after godliness.<a name=365:4></a> They were to be as those who knew what were the thoughts and mind of God and were cast on Him.<a name=365:5></a> If I have got divine teaching, I can say, I know the Shepherd's voice, and if it is not <i>His</i>, I shall know that too.<a name=365:6></a> The truth which is after godliness is not only acknowledged, but is marked and stamped <i>as of God</i> by a man living to and for God.<a name=365:7></a> Godliness is what a man would do if instigated by God; and what a man would not do if God were close by him, it is clear, would certainly not be for God.<a name=365:8></a> A man daily taught by the knowledge of God how to be living for God would do everything to manifest the ways of godliness, knowing those ways because of knowing God.<a name=365:9></a> I speak not of doing right instead of wrong or of conscientiousness.<a name=365:10></a> A believer clearly ought to be righteous with regard to others; but I speak of godliness.<a name=365:11></a> You never can be for God without knowing what God is.<a name=365:12></a> I cannot walk worthy of God if I do not know Him.<a name=365:13></a> I cannot walk with God without that, though I may walk uprightly with man.<a name=365:14></a> Here it is walking worthy of God, the loins being girded (affections tucked up).<a name=365:15></a> This applies to all revealed to us in Christ.<a name=365:16></a> A believer, as to his motives and life, has Christ's mind revealed to him, to shew him how to guide himself through all circumstances.<a name=365:17></a> Christ was always Himself, never guided by circumstances.<a name=365:18></a> Sorrow could draw out His heart in divine love, but in motives and all circumstances He was always Himself (perfect, of course).<a name=365:19></a> It is the mind of Christ that believers are to have.<a name=365:20></a>

		What a wonderful place we have got!<a name=365:21></a> Only as we are taught of God can we get hold of this, that is, the hope of eternal life promised by God before the world began, mark that; for as to the Adam life, it never could be that, but a divine life in those who are saved, a life for heaven; we have got it now, and we shall be there on account of it; there will be its full manifestation, everything there, every word, and all praise will be according to the presence of God; as participators of the divine nature we shall be in fullest blessedness, there where nothing inconsistent with the divine nature can exist, but everything will be in accordance with that life and ourselves as possessors of it in the highest and most blessed perfection.<a name=365:22></a> We belong to that place now, whilst our bodies are down here; the life we have got came down from thence, and has its only full sphere of blessing there.<a name=365:23></a>

		2 Timothy 1: 9 shews the way it was given us in Christ.<a name=366:15></a> God connects the two things here: saved by Christ according to His own purpose and grace given us in Him before the world began.<a name=366:16></a> In this life we see a thing that has its display in heaven.<a name=366:17></a> We have got it now, and in a place where it is hindered.<a name=366:18></a> It leads my thoughts and feelings to be ever in heaven, where it is as before the world began.<a name=366:19></a> Though displayed in all perfection down here by Him who has abolished death, and has brought life and immortality to light, the life was in heaven before it was manifested here.<a name=366:20></a> Wonderful truth!<a name=366:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The law was not an arbitrary thing, but the commandment was holy, just and good.<a name=373:15></a> The apostle, as touching the righteousness which is in the law, was "blameless"; but the moment the law added this, "Thou shalt not lust," to the perfect rule from God for a man where he was, it might as well have said, You must not be a man, for man was already fallen and a sinner.<a name=373:16></a> God added that to the rule of ordinary relationships, and it reaches the conscience.<a name=373:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But Christianity tests man in another way, namely by the very revelation of God.<a name=373:18></a> God did come out in blessed perfect grace and unutterable goodness; His Son became a man.<a name=373:19></a> Still it was the revelation of God, and men would not have God, but they rejected and crucified Him.<a name=373:20></a> Now the condition of man is proved; the judgment of the world is pronounced.<a name=373:21></a> "If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloak for their sin.<a name=373:22></a>" "Now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.<a name=373:23></a>"

		The angels -- witnesses of God's glorious power in creation -- are in a certain sense passed over, but there is no jealousy in these blessed creatures, and when the Lord becomes man, they say, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good pleasure in men.<a name=383:16></a>" The first thing that caused the blessed Son of God to become man was the glory of God.<a name=383:17></a> Nothing but the cross maintains the glory of God.<a name=383:18></a> The more we look at it, the more we see that the cross stands alone in the history of eternity.<a name=383:19></a> "For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the Captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.<a name=383:20></a>" If the blessed Lord undertakes the work, He must go through it really.<a name=383:21></a> If we sinners are to be received to glory, Christ must suffer.<a name=383:22></a> It is only through the cross, morally speaking, that perfect righteousness and holiness and perfect love are reconciled.<a name=383:23></a> If God had cut off Adam and Eve when they sinned, where would have been His love?<a name=383:24></a> If sin had been passed over, there would be no righteousness in that; but the moment I get the cross, I get the fullest and most terrible testimony of God's righteousness against sin.<a name=383:25></a> The more you look at it, the more you see how all good and evil were brought to a complete climax there.<a name=383:26></a> You get sin and wickedness at their height at the cross.<a name=383:27></a> It draws out the complete absolute enmity of man against God.<a name=383:28></a> Then I get another thing, the full power of Satan.<a name=383:29></a> I see in the cross of Christ man's perfectness as well as man's absolute sinfulness; I see His perfect obedience to the Father and His perfect love where He was made sin for us; and I see God's perfect righteousness against sin.<a name=383:30></a> All that man was in wickedness; all Satan's power; all that God is in righteousness and love was brought out at the cross.<a name=383:31></a> "How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation?<a name=383:32></a>" The whole thing has been settled, and Christ is sitting down at the right hand of God because it is settled.<a name=383:33></a><a name=384>[Page 384]</a>

		I get another thing too in this chapter -- Satan's power destroyed; "that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is the devil.<a name=384:1></a>" His power is destroyed, though its effects are not yet gone.<a name=384:2></a> "Resist the devil, and he will flee from you," James 4: 7.<a name=384:3></a> We may listen to his wiles, but his power is destroyed.<a name=384:4></a> Satan put forth his whole power against Christ, and he was allowed to succeed apparently, but his power was broken in resurrection.<a name=384:5></a> "Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive," Psalm 68: 18.<a name=384:6></a> The results are not produced yet, but the work is done that will produce them.<a name=384:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a fourth thing in this chapter.<a name=385:12></a> Christ suffered that He should know how to succour them that are tempted.<a name=385:13></a> "For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.<a name=385:14></a>" The believer is looked at as a poor weak creature always in Hebrews.<a name=385:15></a> The priesthood of Christ in Hebrews is not about our sins (it could not be, because we "have no more conscience of sins"), but about our weakness.<a name=385:16></a> When faith has got hold of the fact, in the power of the Holy Ghost, that Christ has borne my sins, and I come to God by Him, I come in virtue of the work that has purged my conscience.<a name=385:17></a> What I do get in Hebrews is, that Christ can enter into all my temptations.<a name=385:18></a> I find temptations every moment, the world is a snare; if I want to live godly, I need His sympathy.<a name=385:19></a> Christ found none in this world.<a name=385:20></a> He, the most accessible and gracious of men, sympathised with everybody, but there was no one to sympathise with Him.<a name=385:21></a> He can understand the nature of all these trials and temptations of mine.<a name=385:22></a> He knows them a thousand times better than I can, because He has suffered a thousand times more.<a name=385:23></a>

		PURGED WITH BLOOD
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hebrews 9
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.<a name=389:1></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the latter part of this text we find an exclusive and distinct proposition -- that without shedding of blood there is no remission.<a name=389:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the flaming sword placed in the garden of Eden, after man's disobedience, we find his positive exclusion from the presence of God; in our being out of paradise, we see the existing fact, that we are in a state of exclusion from God.<a name=389:3></a> And the question now is, have we any access to God -- to that which is far above paradise?<a name=389:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not only that we are out of paradise, but that we stand in all the accumulation of our transgressions.<a name=389:5></a> In the first act of sin we find that the will of man is disobedience to God; and every act of his since has been treasuring up wrath against the day of wrath.<a name=389:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When our conscience is awakened, we learn how productive of fruit our evil nature is, and whenever we see that all is gone (for innocency once lost is lost for ever), then we find there is no competency in us to enter into association with God.<a name=389:7></a> That which was man's privilege in paradise has been lost, and we find ourselves not only evil, but daily accumulating transgressions.<a name=389:8></a> And can we then enter into the place of God's holiness?<a name=389:9></a> This is the only true question.<a name=389:10></a> Let me ask you -- Is there nothing your consciences own as needing remission?<a name=389:11></a> Murder and theft, etc.<a name=389:12></a>, which are the consequences of the condition man is in, through transgression, are owned by all as evil.<a name=389:13></a> The natural man may see the blessing of moral conduct as giving happiness on earth, but can discern nothing beyond.<a name=389:14></a> But when we look within the veil, it is altogether another thing.<a name=389:15></a> Our not wronging our neighbour may produce temporal happiness: but the revelation of the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ awakens the mind to a new inquiry -- its fitness for the presence of such holiness; and this question is soon settled: we find it utterly impossible.<a name=389:16></a> It is not fitting us for happiness in the world as it is (that is not the question); but making us competent to be associated with Christ in the glory He is in when He appears.<a name=389:17></a> Does the world know anything about it?<a name=389:18></a> Is this what they look for?<a name=389:19></a> Do they not rather say it is presumption to think any can have association and fellowship with God?<a name=389:20></a> The world is a witness to itself that it presumes no such thing.<a name=389:21></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God's testimony is, "There are none righteous, none understand, and none seek after God.<a name=390:1></a>" But suppose we have received an understanding to know Him that is true, then still the question is -- How are we to stand in the presence of the glory?<a name=390:2></a> Can one in a sinful condition abide in His presence?<a name=390:3></a> Can we say we are fit to be partakers of the glory?<a name=390:4></a> There is nothing in the world fit for this.<a name=390:5></a> It is vain to plead the highest morality, or the most refined amiability; they are not the things to qualify us for heaven.<a name=390:6></a> We may find the character of evil all around: all are guilty, for all come short of the glory of God.<a name=390:7></a> The evil of the root from which it springs may be easily discerned in the fruits.<a name=390:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now there must not only be a renewing, but a complete purging of the conscience.<a name=390:9></a> And I plead this, that without the shedding of blood there is no remission: all other ways are the efforts of man to depreciate the righteousness of God -- the substitution of something instead of God's way of salvation, which is most presumptuous and subversive of the great testimony of God, that without the shedding of blood there is no remission.<a name=390:10></a> The accumulated sins of our evil nature must be put away.<a name=390:11></a> The Spirit of God can have no part but bringing us to the knowledge of the hatefulness of sin, and the necessity of the blood shed; and whenever the soul is awakened to what sin is in God's sight, there cannot be peace until the Spirit which shews the necessity of holiness, and reveals that of God, thus teaches us that nothing but God's own efficient act can put away, by the shedding of the blood of Jesus, that which God testifies against.<a name=390:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The shedding the blood brings it to the actual power of death -- the taking away of the life of him whose life is given; and why?<a name=390:13></a> Because there is the forfeiture of life, and therefore the necessity of the life being given, the blood shed, to blot out the sin; and here we find Christ stepping in, and all the believer has entirely shut up in Christ, in whom we have a new nature whereby we can delight in God, and not forgiveness only; and this the consequence of the work of Christ alone, shedding His blood before God, offering His life as a ransom to God, presenting that which was adequate for the purpose, but without which there is no escaping the consequences of sin.<a name=390:14></a> "It pleased the Lord to bruise him.<a name=390:15></a>" The blood was shed, but it is manifested as His own voluntary act.<a name=390:16></a> At the same time His side is pierced that we might know the act complete.<a name=390:17></a> This is presented to our faith as a thing requisite, and which could be done in no other way.<a name=390:18></a> Christ had no associate, no companion; but once alone and for ever the thing was done; and the revelation of it by God to the soul is salvation.<a name=390:19></a> This is a transaction between God and the Son; the thing done is the ground of remission of sins to every one who believes.<a name=390:20></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have not peace in anything in which I take a part, but peace in that in which Christ acted alone.<a name=391:1></a> Man's part in it was only stretching out the sinful hands which crucified Him, and this is all he had to do with it.<a name=391:2></a> Is it, I ask, by any act to be done now that peace is obtained?<a name=391:3></a> No; it is simply by the blood which has been shed, the putting away of sin by the sacrifice of His death, which can give peace through faith.<a name=391:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If once we see ourselves morally dead in trespasses and sins, and that without the full forfeit of life there is no remission, we shall see, as regards the cleansing of the conscience, there is nothing but the blood for us.<a name=391:5></a> But who did this?<a name=391:6></a> It is the act of God to provide Himself a Lamb, by the shedding of whose blood the conscience of those admitted into the holy presence of God is effectually purged.<a name=391:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Can you say paradise is lost, and disobedience and sin are here, and yet I shall force my way back to God?<a name=391:8></a> What hope can those have who are not washed in the blood, taking a worse ground than that which excluded them from paradise (with thus accumulated sin upon them), treasuring up wrath against the day of wrath, and despising that blood which cleanses from all sin, counting it an unholy thing?<a name=391:9></a> He who seeks God's holiness and passes by Jesus, going to God in his sins, passes by the blood, rejects the testimony of God, and despises Jesus.<a name=391:10></a>

		THE WILL OF GOD, THE WORK OF CHRIST, AND THE WITNESS OF THE HOLY GHOST
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hebrews 10
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The basis of the argument of the apostle in this chapter lies more in the contrast than in the comparison between the law and the good things to come.<a name=392:1></a> The law, he says, had only a shadow, not the very image of things.<a name=392:2></a> For example, under the law the priests ministered in infirmity; now Christ ministers in glory.<a name=392:3></a> They offered oftentimes the same sacrifices, which could never take away sins; He one sacrifice -- once for all.<a name=392:4></a> Then there was a veil; now there is none.<a name=392:5></a> Then the priests could not enter into the Holiest; now we have boldness to enter in by the blood of Jesus.<a name=392:6></a> The law had a shadow of good things to come, not the very image.<a name=392:7></a> It was a mere figurative witness of the things that were to be spoken after.<a name=392:8></a> Just as the shadow of a man gives some general indistinct idea of him, but does not present a single feature clearly; so it was with the law.<a name=392:9></a> It could never make the comers thereunto perfect, as the repetition of its sacrifices shewed.<a name=392:10></a> Now the unity of the sacrifice proves its perfection; and the present position of the worshippers gives the most complete contrast possible to that under the law, though there is a certain measure of analogy.<a name=392:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are three things brought out in this scripture: firstly, the source from which all blessing springs; secondly, the means by which it is accomplished; and, thirdly, the testimony by which it is known.<a name=392:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This last is a most necessary part of the matter, in order to our communion; because, unless we know sin to be all put away, it would be absolute madness to attempt to enter into the presence of God: a Jew even would not have thought of such a thing, much less a Christian.<a name=392:13></a> If I am not as clean as an angel, the presence of God is no place for me; and the attempt to appear in it would be to follow the example of Cain, who thought to stand before God as a worshipper without blood.<a name=392:14></a> We may cry to Him from the depths, of course, and He will ever hear; but if the conscience be not perfect, we cannot go into His presence to worship.<a name=392:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With the Jews this perfection was of course only ceremonial; with us it is real: with them the veil hid God; now that it is gone, and that we enter into the holiest of all, there is the greater need of perfection of conscience.<a name=392:16></a> This is why the apostle insists so strongly on the word "once.<a name=392:17></a>" Indeed all the reasoning of the chapter depends on it.<a name=392:18></a> "Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many.<a name=392:19></a>" "Once, in the end of the world, hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.<a name=392:20></a>" "We are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.<a name=392:21></a>" If those sacrifices could have wrought perfection of conscience, would they not have ceased to be offered?<a name=392:22></a> Christ was once offered, thereby proving the perfect result of His word; it needed no repetition.<a name=392:23></a> That is why he says, elsewhere in this epistle, that, if this be rejected, "there remaineth no more offering for sin.<a name=392:24></a>" If that has not made perfect, there is no hope.<a name=392:25></a> If that be rejected, there is only "a fearful looking for of judgment.<a name=392:26></a>" In the repetition of sacrifice there was a remembrance made of sins.<a name=392:27></a> It was not God's saying, Their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.<a name=392:28></a> Christians now have often a mind to be in the same place still, and call their unbelief humility.<a name=392:29></a> With the Jews, of course, it must have been so, because it was not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats could take away sins.<a name=392:30></a> Therefore God changes the whole thing.<a name=392:31></a> "He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.<a name=392:32></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		This brings out the first principle to which I alluded, namely, the source of all blessing.<a name=393:1></a> It originates in the divine will.<a name=393:2></a> "Lo, I come to do thy will, O God.<a name=393:3></a>" It originates in the will of God, and not in the will of man: this is only sin.<a name=393:4></a> As a creature, man should have no will of his own, just as Christ had none.<a name=393:5></a> The principle of His obedience was not a controlling power, hindering the operation of His own will; but, "Lo, I come to do thy will, O God!<a name=393:6></a>" This was perfect obedience as a man.<a name=393:7></a> God's will was His; and that will alone brought salvation and life, where man's will had only brought sin and death.<a name=393:8></a> This gives stability and perfection to everything, to find its source and origin in the will of God.<a name=393:9></a> If it had been the result of my will, all would have been vacillating and changing as man's will is; and, moreover, if we had earned heaven by our own will, there would have been no love of God in the matter, and we should lose the sweetness of holding everything as the fruit of divine love.<a name=393:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This will of God is not presented to man to do; it is the Son of God who says, "Lo, I come to do thy will, O God!<a name=393:11></a>" Men could never have done the will of God; the second Adam does it.<a name=393:12></a> As belonging to the first Adam, our place is to confess that we have not done, and that we never could do, the will of God.<a name=393:13></a> When brought back to Him, of course we have nothing else to do, for we are sanctified unto obedience; but, as regards acceptance, it is the result of the work of another.<a name=393:14></a> "By the obedience of One shall many be made righteous.<a name=393:15></a>" God does all for us in grace, and leaves man out in both the will and work.<a name=393:16></a> Salvation is the result of God's will and Christ's work.<a name=393:17></a> And it gives quietness and confidence in this work, to see that it was not a work done to turn God towards us, as it were, but that from all eternity it was counselled by Himself.<a name=393:18></a> We have the source of all in the unchangeable purpose of God.<a name=393:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Secondly, we have the work itself.<a name=394:1></a> It is a wonderful thing for us to be thus let into what passed between the Father and the Son before the world was; and most blessed to see the freewill offering of Christ.<a name=394:2></a> If it were God's will to be the author of our salvation, it was equally Christ's to be the instrument of it; and whilst He, in order to be so, makes Himself a servant, His divine power is still evinced in the very expression, "Lo, I come to do thy will, O God!<a name=394:3></a>" That could be said by none but by one competent to execute any command of God.<a name=394:4></a> Supposing that command had been to make a world, instead of to save one, Christ was the only one who could do such a will; and in fact, both divine power and divine love were evinced in redemption and resurrection, in a higher degree than in creation.<a name=394:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In verse 5, where the quotation is from Psalm 40, the verbal difference is considerable, but the sense identical.<a name=394:6></a> "A body hast thou prepared me," and "Mine ears hast thou opened," or "digged," are both expressions of assuming the form of a servant.<a name=394:7></a> The ear receives commands, and the boring of the ear was making one a servant for ever.<a name=394:8></a> So when a body was prepared for Christ, He took on Him the form of a servant.<a name=394:9></a> Thus far we have the will of God working in grace, and Christ undertaking to accomplish it.<a name=394:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in verse 11 we have the contrast between the priest standing, and Christ sitting.<a name=394:11></a> His work is finished -- there is nothing further to do; and He sits down till His foes be made His footstool.<a name=394:12></a> "For ever," in verse 12, means "continually" or "constantly," not that Christ will never rise again; but as regards His sacrifice for sins He will never have to rise again to do anything more.<a name=394:13></a> Having offered one sacrifice for sins, He sits down till His foes be made His footstool.<a name=394:14></a> As regards His friends, all is done -- not as to intercession of course -- but as to acceptance and perfecting the conscience.<a name=394:15></a> But He has still to deal with His enemies; therefore is He waiting, still retaining His servant character, until God makes His foes His footstool.<a name=394:16></a> We too are expecting, till Christ rises up from the throne and judges His enemies.<a name=394:17></a> This is not done yet: else wickedness would be purged from the earth; and it explains the call for vengeance in the Psalms, which sometimes puzzles people, "Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered," etc.<a name=394:18></a>; and, "Of thy mercy cut off mine enemies.<a name=394:19></a>" These surely are not the cries of the church.<a name=394:20></a> She does not want to see her enemies judged but saved.<a name=394:21></a> She goes to meet the Lord in the air.<a name=394:22></a> Not so the Jewish remnant.<a name=394:23></a> It passes through great tribulation; and "except those days were shortened, no flesh should be saved.<a name=394:24></a>" So they call earnestly enough for deliverance.<a name=394:25></a> But such is not our part at all; we are associated with Christ while expecting; in grace now, and in glory by-and-by, but not in judgment.<a name=394:26></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In verse 12 we have seen that Christ's one sacrifice was such that He has sat down for ever; so in verse 14 we read; that "by one offering he hath perfected for ever" -- or "continually" -- "them that are sanctified.<a name=395:1></a>" Thus we are continually perfect; not practically here -- though the Spirit sanctifies the heart and affections as far as this goes -- but here the work of Christ makes the conscience constantly perfect.<a name=395:2></a> "The worshippers, once purged, should have no more conscience of sins.<a name=395:3></a>" Thus we are brought into the presence of God, never to have any more conscience of sins.<a name=395:4></a> "For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.<a name=395:5></a>" We are called so to know Christ's work, as to see that it is quite impossible for us to have sin on us before God.<a name=395:6></a> Sin cannot be in God's presence.<a name=395:7></a> There is nothing but perfection there; and we are there because perfected for ever by the one offering of Jesus.<a name=395:8></a> We are in God's presence because we are clean, as clean as He could wish us to be.<a name=395:9></a> "The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.<a name=395:10></a>" It is quite true we have to keep a conscience void of offence, and not to grieve the Spirit; but we are sealed of God unto the day of redemption; and there can be no mistake.<a name=395:11></a> The Holy Ghost could not dwell in us unless cleansed by the blood of Christ; and then He is the witness, not to the fruits, but to the virtue of that blood.<a name=395:12></a> The fruits could not be produced unless He were there of course, because they are "the fruits of the Spirit"; and when produced, the order is, first, the internal ones, then all the rest.<a name=395:13></a> "Love, joy, peace," precede the outward manifestations of the Spirit's presence.<a name=395:14></a>

		The Christian ought to keep himself in the present communion of his known place before God, because then, besides the joy, the Holy Ghost has its full flow in using him as a vessel to others, in God's service; whereas otherwise He must occupy us with ourselves.<a name=396:1></a> I have not only communion, but power, only as thus in immediate intercourse with God in His presence.<a name=396:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We now come to the third point.<a name=396:3></a> Having seen the source of all in the divine will, and the accomplishment of all in the divine work, we get the testimony to it all in the divine witness.<a name=396:4></a> "Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us; for after that he had said before, This is the covenant," etc.<a name=396:5></a>, then He said, "And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.<a name=396:6></a>" And here is the secret of settled peace.<a name=396:7></a> If I think that God will ever remember sin, I am denying the will, the work, and the testimony of God.<a name=396:8></a> In short, if a believer in Jesus, it comes to being a sin to have the least thought of God's ever imputing a sin to me.<a name=396:9></a> It is just as much a work of the flesh as to commit the sin.<a name=396:10></a> He does not now impute sin, and He never will.<a name=396:11></a> "Where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin," sweeps away every refuge of lies, and lays the blessed foundation for full confidence.<a name=396:12></a> "Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest, by the blood of Jesus," shews that the very way we enter into God's presence proves that the thing which shut us out is gone for ever.<a name=396:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Our bodies washed with pure water," refers to the priests, who were washed with water, sprinkled with blood, and anointed with oil.<a name=396:14></a> The latter is not mentioned here.<a name=396:15></a> After they were once washed, the priests needed only to wash their hands and feet.<a name=396:16></a> The anointing with blood of the ear, the thumb, and the toe, was the application of the work of Christ to the whole moral man.<a name=396:17></a> The work of Christ is always set first, then follows the work of the Spirit.<a name=396:18></a> In Ephesians it is said, "Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it, that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word.<a name=396:19></a>" Therefore in the tabernacle the first thing you meet is not the laver, but the altar.<a name=396:20></a> As a sinner, I must first meet the blood; then I am fitted for service, by the removal of all that is contrary to God: but I cannot skip the altar to reach the laver; I must there own myself a sinner first; then I can delight in the holiness of God, and understand it, too.<a name=396:21></a>

		The apostle then goes on, "Consider one another to provoke unto love," etc.<a name=397:1></a>, that is, having got to God in grace, we must be diligent in acting towards others in grace.<a name=397:2></a> He introduces "Not forsaking the assembling of yourselves together," to meet the tendency there was to avoid public testimony, and to think that private faith would do in times of persecution such as these were.<a name=397:3></a> This was their natural tendency; and, whether it be persecution or reproach, it is the same thing.<a name=397:4></a> The latter is perhaps our snare.<a name=397:5></a> "And so much the more as ye see the day approaching"; for judgment is surely coming.<a name=397:6></a> If the power of evil increases there is the more need to cling closely to Christ.<a name=397:7></a> And we must not suppose that the world is improving because the Spirit is working; on the contrary, this is just the proof that judgment is nearing.<a name=397:8></a> The more rapidly souls are gathered in, the more reason have we for believing the coming of the Lord to be at hand.<a name=397:9></a> Whilst the long-suffering of God is salvation, the hope should ever be a present one to the church.<a name=397:10></a> It was the wicked servant who said, "My lord delayeth his coming"; yet He did delay it.<a name=397:11></a>

		Then, in verse 26, it is as though he said, If you do not hold fast -- if you will give up, and abandon this perfect sacrifice, then there remains nothing further; there is no year of atonement to come round again with a new offering; but just as those who believe are eternally perfect, so he who refuses is left remediless.<a name=397:12></a> It was he who despised Moses' law who died without mercy, and not he who broke it; so it is he who counts the blood of the covenant an unholy thing, and does despite to the Spirit of grace, that shall be counted worthy of a sorer punishment; not he who fails.<a name=397:13></a> "If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous; and he is the propitiation for our sins"; such is the gracious provision for failure through infirmity -- advocacy, righteousness, and propitiation.<a name=397:14></a> But if a man, after having seen all the grace and fulness that are in Christ, deliberately choose sin as his portion; and, rejecting the blood of the new covenant as insufficient, turns back again, then he must take the consequence.<a name=397:15></a> God's grace is His last resource, so to speak, for winning man.<a name=397:16></a> If that does not suffice, judgment must take its course; and "it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.<a name=397:17></a>" On this ground the position is at once that of "adversaries," and we know Him that hath said, "Vengeance is mine, I will recompense.<a name=397:18></a>" "Let us, therefore, hold fast our confidence, which hath great recompense of reward"; and let us remember that we shall "have need of patience; but yet a little while, and he that shall come, will come, and will not tarry.<a name=397:19></a>"
