		ON GIFTS AND OFFICES IN THE CHURCH

		It is far more happy to be occupied in considering the riches of the grace of God and of the love of Christ than to be discussing questions of offices and of institutions.<a name=1:2></a> It is however at times necessary to speak about these also, when they are put forward with a view of troubling the peace of Christians and of exciting their minds, as if their Christianity were defective, as if they were walking disorderly, and as if, before God, something were lacking to them.<a name=1:3></a> It is, then, in order to clear up these contested points, and to tranquillize the minds of Christians, that I would say a few words upon offices and gifts.<a name=1:4></a> I do so, however, with the most fervent desire that each one, after being really enlightened upon the subject, may turn from these questions and leave them entirely alone, so as to be occupied with Christ, and His exhaustless love and immeasurable grace.<a name=1:5></a> For it is that which nourishes and edifies, while questions tend to dryness and barrenness of soul.<a name=1:6></a>

		There is a great difference between gifts and charges.<a name=1:7></a> Gifts flow down from the Head, which is Christ, among the members, so as to assemble, by their means, the Church outside of the world, and to build it up so far as thus gathered together.<a name=1:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Those to whom charges were entrusted, were as such "overseers," or "servants," established in each locality by the apostles, and who received from them their position and their authority.<a name=1:9></a> They might have gifts, and it was desirable that they should; but very often they had none.<a name=1:10></a> In either case, when they were faithful and devoted to their service, they were blessed of God.<a name=1:11></a> We will now examine the instruction of holy scripture concerning gifts.<a name=1:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Everything which is good is a gift, and comes from God.<a name=1:13></a> But here we speak of gifts in a rather more restricted and more limited sense; namely, the gifts bestowed by God for the gathering together of His Church and for its edification, according as it is written: "Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men," Ephesians 4: 8.<a name=1:14></a> That is, the gifts of which we speak

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Man, through sin, has brought many a thing to a close in ruin.<a name=2:2></a> Without law he was lost in dissoluteness, in independence, in towering violence and corruption.<a name=2:3></a> Under the law he became a transgressor and despiser of the authority of God.<a name=2:4></a> God visited man in mercy there where he was lying in misery, vile and disobedient; and man has rejected God.<a name=2:5></a> He was a sinner, driven out of the earthly paradise.<a name=2:6></a> God came down into this miserable world of man's; but, so far as it lay in man's power to do it, he drove God out of the world.<a name=2:7></a> There remains thus for man -- as altogether the servant of the prince and god of this world -- nothing but judgment.<a name=2:8></a> God will not however, in any, even the least respect, fail to accomplish His own designs.<a name=2:9></a> Every hope for the first man, as such, is lost.<a name=2:10></a> But God has glorified the second Man, Adam, even Him who was obedient (the Lord from heaven), and has taken Him up into the heavenly place predestined for Him.<a name=2:11></a> Yet He still acts in grace upon the hearts of the children of men to give them a new life, and to gather the objects of His grace outside of the world, uniting them to Christ glorified, so that they may enjoy, together with Him, all blessings, and, which is more precious than all else, that they may rejoice together with Him in the Father's love.<a name=2:12></a> Thus those that are born again are also members of Christ, of Him who is the Head of the body.<a name=2:13></a> But there is still another truth which connects itself with the object we have in view; namely, that Christ has won that position by the accomplishment of the work of redemption.<a name=2:14></a> We were captives of the devil and of sin: now we are set free.<a name=2:15></a> Christ has led captivity captive, and He fills those whom He sets free with the power of the Holy Spirit that they may serve Him.<a name=2:16></a> Having overcome Satan and finished the work of redemption, He is ascended up on high, and, as Head of the Church, He has received of the Father the Holy Spirit of promise for the members of His body.<a name=2:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Christian being redeemed receives the Holy Spirit in two manners.<a name=2:18></a> He is sealed with the Spirit, the earnest of our inheritance, and thus is one with the Lord, and united to Him; then he has received the Holy Spirit as power for service to Christ.<a name=2:19></a> Such is the way the gifts connect themselves with these truths.<a name=2:20></a> The work of redemption is accomplished; and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		believers are perfectly purified from their sins, so that, by virtue of the blood of Christ wherewith they are sprinkled, the Holy Spirit can dwell in them.<a name=3:1></a> Christ, having glorified God, His Father, upon earth, has sat down, as man, at the right hand of God, as Head of the Church, whose everlasting righteousness He is.<a name=3:2></a> As such, He has received the Holy Spirit for His members, that is to say, for those that believe in Him; Acts 2: 33; Ephesians 4: 8.<a name=3:3></a> We are the righteousness of God in Him; 2 Corinthians 5: 21.<a name=3:4></a> Already the Holy Spirit -- sent by the Father in the name of the Son -- and come down from the Son, dwells in believers as the witness of His glory and the Spirit of power, as the Spirit of liberty and adoption, on behalf of the Father, and as coming from the Father, in order to communicate to them the certainty of salvation, and also to accomplish on the earth, as power and wisdom, the work of the Lord, in the members of the body.<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All important and precious as is the first-named point, we will for the present leave it in order to say a few words on gifts.<a name=3:6></a> The Holy Spirit is upon earth, in virtue of the finished work of redemption, and of the session of Christ at the right hand of God.<a name=3:7></a> There He acts, by means of the gospel, so as to proclaim the love of God, to gather together the elect, and to form of them one body, the body of Christ.<a name=3:8></a> Every converted soul, which has received the life of Christ and been sealed with the Holy Spirit, is a member of Christ, of the heavenly Head.<a name=3:9></a> We can consider then the gifts as either the gifts of Christ, or as the operation of the Holy Ghost now upon the earth.<a name=3:10></a> The holy scripture gives us both of these aspects.<a name=3:11></a> In Ephesians 4 it speaks of the gifts of Christ.<a name=3:12></a> In 1 Corinthians 12 and 14 it speaks of the unity of the body, and of the gifts as produced by the Spirit in the different members.<a name=3:13></a> In each case, the gifts are in connection with the unity of the body, as may be easily seen by reading Ephesians 4.<a name=3:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before going farther, let it be remarked, that the gifts are of two kinds: first, such as serve to awaken souls, and to gather the Church; and, secondly, such as are signs to the world, signs of the presence of God in the Person of the Spirit in the Church.<a name=3:15></a> The Epistle to the Ephesians speaks to us only of the former; the Epistle to the Corinthians speaks of both.<a name=3:16></a> The word of God itself makes the above distinction, when it says that tongues are for a sign to unbelievers, and prophesyings are for believers (1 Corinthians 14: 22).<a name=3:17></a> This distinction is important,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		because it is impossible that anything should fail which is necessary for the conversion of souls, and for the building up of saints; whereas it is easy enough to conceive that God should withdraw that which was an ornament to the Church, and a token of its acceptability, when the Church is unfaithful, and when, instead of honouring God, she has grieved the Spirit.<a name=4:1></a> Nevertheless this external testimony remained, according to the wisdom of God in the Church, so long as it was needed, in order to confirm the preaching of the truths of the gospel.<a name=4:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All gifts proceed immediately from Christ the Head, and have their existence in believers by the energy of the Holy Spirit.<a name=4:3></a> Ephesians 4 and 1 Corinthians 12 present to us these two important truths very clearly and very explicitly, while at the same time they give us their principle and their development.<a name=4:4></a> Ephesians 4 treats exclusively of the gifts which serve for the gathering and edification of the Church.<a name=4:5></a> Christ is ascended up on high, and has received gifts for men, who, in the enjoyment by faith of the work of Christ in redemption, by the which they are completely delivered from the power of Satan, to which they were previously subject -- having also been made vessels of the grace and power, which flows down from on high, of Christ, who is the Head -- become instruments of the Christ who is absent, by means of the gifts which are communicated to them.<a name=4:6></a> The Lord laid the foundation by the apostles and prophets, who are (says the apostle Paul, Ephesians 2) the foundation, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief cornerstone.<a name=4:7></a> There yet abide evangelists, pastors, and teachers; and, so long as Christ loves the Church, and is the alone source of grace -- so long as He desires to nourish the members of His own body -- these same gifts will remain for the edification of the Church.<a name=4:8></a> But whereas -- while the healthful action of these gifts is by means of the presence and power of the Holy Spirit -- Christians are unhappily often unfaithful, and neglect His rebukes, it comes to pass that the development of the gifts, and their public efficacy, are little apparent, and their activity is diminished.<a name=4:9></a> This is true in general; and that both as to individual Christian life, and as to the practical state of the Church.<a name=4:10></a> But it is not the less true, that Christ always faithfully cares for His own body.<a name=4:11></a> On that care we can always count, though as to details we may be humbled on account of our own unfaithfulness.<a name=4:12></a> Also the Lord has said, The harvest is
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		plenteous, but the labourers are few; and that we should pray the Lord of the harvest to send forth more labourers.<a name=5:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Every one who has received a gift has thereby become servant of Him who communicated it to him.<a name=5:2></a> In every case we are the servants of Christ, who alone is Lord of our souls; but every Christian, in particular, is His servant, as to any gift He may have conferred upon him; and, because He has conferred it on him, each one is responsible both to use it and to trade with it -- I mean to trade with it, with the view for which Christ communicated it.<a name=5:3></a> Without doubt, each Christian is subject to the general discipline of the Church, or of the assembly, both as to his whole life and as to his service.<a name=5:4></a> But he serves Christ, and not men.<a name=5:5></a> He brings forth fruit for the assembly, because he serves Christ; he renders service to Christians, because he is the servant of Christ the Lord.<a name=5:6></a> Also, he must needs serve, because he is the servant of Christ, and has received, for that end, a part of his Lord's goods.<a name=5:7></a> Such is the doctrine of the parable of the three servants, whose lord went into a far country, and gave unto them of his goods; to the one more, to the other less.<a name=5:8></a> With what view?<a name=5:9></a> that they might be idle and listless?<a name=5:10></a> No; he committed to them the talents in order that they might trade with them.<a name=5:11></a> We do not commit materials and tools to men, in order that they may do nothing.<a name=5:12></a> Not only is such a thought senseless, but, if the love of Christ and His love to souls energize in our hearts, idleness and inaction are altogether impossible.<a name=5:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The presence and the activity of Christ's love in our hearts is thus, in truth, tested.<a name=5:14></a> If the love of Christ be active in my heart, would it be possible for me to remain inactive in any case in which I could be of use to one soul beloved of Him?<a name=5:15></a> Certainly not.<a name=5:16></a> The power to act thus, the wisdom needful to do it, in a way which would be agreeable to Him, comes always and directly from Himself, while the love of Christ in the heart is that which keeps the heart lively.<a name=5:17></a> In order to have courage for action, I must have confidence in Christ: otherwise the heart will say, "Perhaps He will not accept what I do"; "it may be He will not be content with me"; "would not this be too rash, too hasty?<a name=5:18></a>" "it might be proud to attempt that.<a name=5:19></a>" The sluggard says, "There is a lion in the way"; whereas love is not inactive but intelligent, because it confides in Christ.<a name=5:20></a> Love apprehends what love wishes; it yields itself to the will of Christ, and follows the example of Christ, its

	<div class="paragraph">
		guide.<a name=6:1></a> Such is the action of that very love which is in Christ, and which acts with humble and true wisdom.<a name=6:2></a> It is obedient and intelligent, understanding from grace its duty, and drawing out of the love of Christ courage to fulfil it.<a name=6:3></a> And whose conduct did Christ approve of and accept?<a name=6:4></a> Was it his who, out of a heart's confidence, laboured without any other commandment, or his who was afraid to do so?<a name=6:5></a> We all know the answer.<a name=6:6></a> The approbation of Christ suffices for the heart of the Christian, and suffices for his justification in his deed.<a name=6:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Brethren, when we have His acceptance manifest and declared, we may leave all the rest alone.<a name=6:8></a> This is just what to be faithful to Christ means.<a name=6:9></a> Let us have patience.<a name=6:10></a> He will judge everything ere long.<a name=6:11></a> Till then let us walk by faith: His word is enough for us.<a name=6:12></a> At the time appointed He will justify us before the world, and will put full honour upon His own word and our faith.<a name=6:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord Jesus has, then, received these gifts as Himself a man, and has given them to men, for the effectuating the work of the gospel and of the Church; those therefore who have received these gifts must needs turn them to their full profit, according to God, to Will souls, to edify Christians, and to glorify their Lord and heavenly Master.<a name=6:14></a> In Ephesians 4 we have seen the gifts of edification represented as being trusts made here below by Christ Himself ascended up on high, while the members of His body upon the earth are being gathered, and while, by means of an activity which acts the one upon the other, the body grows, and is at the same time kept from every wind of doctrine, until it come unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.<a name=6:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The gifts are looked at in 1 Corinthians 12 rather according to the energy of the Holy Spirit upon earth, who distributes them to each as He will.<a name=6:16></a> Therefore we find here, not only gifts of edification, but all those which are the result of the power of the Spirit and signs of His presence.<a name=6:17></a> This chapter examines everything which can be considered as a spiritual manifestation; and while it distinctly speaks of the action of the power of demons, it shews us the means of distinguishing these from divine gifts.<a name=6:18></a> It sets forth, in the very clearest manner, the doctrine of the body and members of Christ, drawing our attention to this: that there is but one only Lord, by whose authority those who have gifts labour -- whether in the world, or in the assembly of saints -- to accomplish the work

		of God by the efficacy of the Holy Spirit.<a name=7:1></a> Each member is dependent upon the action of the others, because all have been baptized by one and the same Spirit.<a name=7:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Romans 12 and 1 Peter 4: 10 the gifts are briefly enumerated.<a name=7:3></a> In Romans, again, as the members of the body of Christ, and, in general, with the object of exhorting those who possess gifts not to go beyond that which has been given to them, but to keep within the limits of their gift.<a name=7:4></a> In 1 Peter 4 the Holy Spirit exhorts Christians to use the gifts which have been bestowed upon them, as the immediate and faithful t stewards of God Himself; to speak as the oracles of God; to serve as by the ability received of God.<a name=7:5></a> In all this teaching, we find nothing about office; the subject is simply the members of the body of Christ who all take their part in the edifying of the body, and who are held responsible to do so.<a name=7:6></a> All do not speak -- all do not preach the gospel -- all do not teach, because all have not these gifts; but all are obliged, according to scripture, to do (according to the scriptural order of the house of God) that which God has given them to do.<a name=7:7></a> When once it understood that all Christians are members of Christ, and that each member has his own proper work -- his own service in the body, all becomes simple and clear.<a name=7:8></a> We have all a duty to fulfil, and that in the strength of God; and the less seen is perhaps the most precious, while exercising itself before God and not before man.<a name=7:9></a> But all have something to do.<a name=7:10></a> To say that all have office is to deny that there are special offices.<a name=7:11></a> Nothing can be clearer, if we examine history and the instruction of scripture upon this point.<a name=7:12></a> We see in it that, in that which concerns either the preaching of the gospel in the world, or the edification of Christians in gathering, the question is never about office, but that all depends upon gifts.<a name=7:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us turn to a few passages in proof of this assertion.<a name=7:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have already called attention to Matthew 25.<a name=7:15></a> In the parable of the talents committed to the three servants, the Lord lays down this principle, that two of them are worthy of praise because they had traded, without being otherwise authorized than by the fact itself that their lord had committed to them his money; while the third is blamed and punished for having expected a warrant, because he had not confidence in his lord, and had not dared to trade without some further obligation.<a name=7:16></a> This means, that the gifts themselves are, for the workman, a warrant or authorization fully sufficient to trade

		with the gift which he has, if the love of Christ constrain his heart; but, if this love is not there, he is under responsibility; and the proof that the love of Christ is not in action in him is, that he has not served by means of his gift -- he is a bad and a lazy servant.<a name=8:1></a> Christ gives not gifts with the object that we should not turn them to profit; He gives them, rather, that we may use them with energy.<a name=8:2></a> We find also, that, in point of fact, so it was among the early Christians.<a name=8:3></a> When the persecution which ensued upon the death of Stephen had dispersed the Christians, they went everywhere preaching the gospel (Acts 8: 4).<a name=8:4></a> And we read (chapter 11: 21) that the hand of the Lord was with them.<a name=8:5></a> But is it possible that if I know the means by which a soul may be saved, I ought not to announce that way, though God may have rendered me able to do so?<a name=8:6></a> In private anyone can do such a thing; but the ability to preach in public is precisely the gift of God in this respect.<a name=8:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul finding himself in prison at Rome, many of the brethren in the Lord waxed bold on seeing his bonds, and fearlessly dared to preach the word; Philippians 1: 13, 14.<a name=8:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When false teachers go forth to seduce the Lord's people, the receiving them or the not receiving them in no wise depends upon any office they have, or upon the absence of an official character.<a name=8:9></a> Even a woman is directed to judge for herself by doctrine (2 John).<a name=8:10></a> It did not for an instant come into the thought of the apostle to use such a means as the possession of office, in order to guard a woman on the occurrence of a time of difficulty; he simply writes to her to judge each according to his doctrine.<a name=8:11></a> It does not even come into his head to counsel this woman to ask of him who presents himself as preacher whether he has office, or is consecrated or ordained.<a name=8:12></a> On the contrary he praises the beloved Gaius, because he had received the brethren who were gone forth in the name of Christ; and he exhorts him to bring them on their way in a manner worthy of God.<a name=8:13></a> In so doing Gaius would become a co-labourer with the truth (3 John 8).<a name=8:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So far as the preaching of the gospel is concerned, the word of God then confirms this doctrine, that each, according to his capacity, and the opportunities which God in His grace affords him, is obliged to announce the good news.<a name=8:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The scripture is quite clear also as to the edification of believers.<a name=8:16></a> Not only does it present us with this general truth, that Christ has given gifts, and that the Holy Spirit acts thereby,

		in order that we may fulfil the work of God in every way (Ephesians 4 and 1 Corinthians 12); but, moreover, it speaks with exactness and clearness of the duty of those who possess gifts.<a name=9:1></a> The Holy Spirit says by the mouth of Peter (1 Peter 4: 10), "As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards.<a name=9:2></a> of the manifold grace of God.<a name=9:3></a>" Then in 1 Corinthians 14 we find the order according to which the exercise of gifts should take place, "Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.<a name=9:4></a> If anything be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace.<a name=9:5></a> For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.<a name=9:6></a>" James shews us distinctly the true limits of this service, without reference to office, when he says that believers should not be many teachers, because that the responsibility thereof would be all the greater, and that (since we all in various ways offend) they would suffer a so much the greater judgment.<a name=9:7></a> It is, then, perfectly certain that gifts, and the service which believers render by gifts, are completely independent of the possession of office; and that those to whom God has communicated these gifts are obliged to use them for the edification of the saints.<a name=9:8></a> The scripture gives the rules according to which the exercises of the gifts ought to take place; it requires that the spirits of the prophets be subject to the prophets, and that all be done unto edification, in such wise that there be no disorder in the assembly.<a name=9:9></a> As to office, the scripture says not one single word upon this subject in this respect.<a name=9:10></a><a href="#9:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, on this subject, we beg that it may be remarked, that between gift and office there exists a great difference, and that this difference depends upon the nature of the two things.<a name=9:11></a> The gift has its course, it is available everywhere.<a name=9:12></a> If I am an evangelist, I shall preach the gospel wheresoever God may call me.<a name=9:13></a> Am I a teacher?<a name=9:14></a> I shall teach believers according to my ability, wheresoever I may chance to find myself.<a name=9:15></a> Apollos teaches at Ephesus; he is also of use to believers at Corinth.<a name=9:16></a> But if any one has received an office, he fulfils the service which is connected with it in the determinate place where he has

		We find but little in scripture about the servants (or deacons).<a name=11:3></a> In Acts 6 we read that the apostles, not wishing to have any more to serve tables, require the Christians to choose seven from among themselves, who should fulfil the duties of deacons, though they are not called by the name; and, to say the least, they had in many respects the suited qualifications which are enumerated by the apostle Paul to Timothy and to Titus.<a name=11:4></a>

		It may be asked, Now that there are no apostles, what ought we to do as to elders?<a name=11:5></a> Our God, who has in all times foreknown the wants of His beloved Church, has given us the answer in the word, and has taken sufficient heed of these wants.<a name=11:6></a> We read, "And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you; and to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake.<a name=11:7></a> And be at peace among yourselves," 1 Thessalonians 5: 12, 13.<a name=11:8></a> At the same time, the apostle distinctly sets forth the common responsibility of all the saints.<a name=11:9></a> "Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men.<a name=11:10></a> See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men," 1 Thessalonians 5: 14, 15.<a name=11:11></a>

		The duty of deacons is also, as for the elders, expressed in their name.<a name=12:3></a> The Greek word <i>diakonos</i> signifies servant.<a name=12:4></a> They served the assembly as its servants; there were also sisters (as Phoebe) with the same title.<a name=12:5></a> If we examine Acts 6, the seven who cared for the poor widows as deacons had this service specially allotted to them for their portion.<a name=12:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Nevertheless all the elders had not gifts.<a name=12:9></a> "Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine," 1 Timothy 5: 17.<a name=12:10></a> The deacons, like all other Christians, had to exercise them when they possessed them.<a name=12:11></a> The deacons, where they fulfilled their charge faithfully and carefully, found also their own spiritual profit therein.<a name=12:12></a> "For they that have used the office of a deacon well, purchase to themselves a good degree and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus" (1 Tim 3: 13); as we may see most fully made good in the cases of Stephen and Philip; Acts 6, 7 and 8.<a name=12:13></a>

		We see too elsewhere how Christians, without losing their proper responsibility according to grace, had to be subject to those that were at the work.<a name=12:14></a> "I beseech you, brethren (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints), that ye submit yourselves unto such, and to everyone that helpeth with us, and laboureth," 1 Corinthians 16: 15, 16.<a name=12:15></a> The Christian can never lay aside his individual responsibility.<a name=12:16></a> The discipline of the assembly recalls to a walk according to that responsibility, when the Christian has forgotten so to walk.<a name=12:17></a> Brethren, then, who by the Lord's grace are called to the work, labour to maintain the Christian walk, to strengthen the feeble, to instruct the ignorant, to exhort and to encourage all, to nourish by the word and to render all able, by that divine nourishment, to honour God and the doctrine of the Saviour-in short, to be in every way a help, the common responsibility being in view.<a name=12:18></a>

		These two public offices then are now entirely wanting to us; no one can restore them officially according to holy scripture, after a divine sort, because no one has received, in order to do so, authority or commission on the part of God to do so.<a name=13:4></a> But the scripture provides morally for subjection to those whom God raises up to service: and inasmuch as Christ is infallibly faithful toward His body, and inasmuch as the Holy Spirit is always in the Church upon earth, the gifts necessary to the edification of the assembly are always there.<a name=13:5></a> The feeble state of the Church of God shews itself, it is true, in this respect as in every other; but Christ ever remains faithful, and cannot cease to nourish His members.<a name=13:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The doctrine of scripture as to gifts has been almost forgotten; or else it is altogether set aside by assigning the right to edify men to those who have been placed by men in their positions -- positions which men have for the most part invented for themselves.<a name=13:7></a> And when even it is conceded that God furnishes the gifts, it is not any the more permitted to those who possess them to exercise them without a sanction from man.<a name=13:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The confusion arising from the mixture of gifts and offices, which men have invented, has resulted in what is ordinarily called "clergy," and even worship; and it is carried so far as to maintain, that, if this confusion is not recognized, the service due to God is denied.<a name=13:9></a> But the true service to God is there, where each member of Christ serves God also (be it in the word, or be it for the edification of the brethren, and thus of the whole body of Christ) with the gift which Christ has communicated to him by the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=13:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If in the existing state of the Church the public re-establishment of the offices which scripture recognizes is not possible, God has nevertheless previously ordained all that is necessary, all that is good for such a state, sad as it may be; as also He will infallibly give all that is useful to those who ask it of Him.<a name=13:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The scripture is ignorant of any official ceremony for the administration of the Lord's supper, as men speak; and God nowhere therein declares, that it is the privilege of a person consecrated, or set apart, to administer it.<a name=14:6></a> "The disciples came together to break bread," Acts 20: 7.<a name=14:7></a> Probably those who were esteemed among them began the breaking of bread with prayer before distributing it, because it is evidently comely as a general principle that such should have this place and not a service, and charity does not behave itself unseemly: nevertheless scripture has said nothing upon the subject The blessing used in worship is but a giving of thanks, as we see in 1 Corinthians 14: 16, "Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?<a name=14:8></a>" Even the Lord gave thanks before breaking the bread.<a name=14:9></a> "And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me," 1 Corinthians 11: 24.<a name=14:10></a>

		You have asked of me some account of the historical development of a false notion on which I have often spoken, and already written briefly in the "Present Testimony.<a name=15:1></a>" The practical importance of this notion had caused my mind to be occupied with it, and led me to entertain the thought of pursuing its history.<a name=15:2></a> The false notion which I refer to is the confusion of two distinct aspects of the Church, given us in scripture: that of the house of God, and that of the body of Christ.<a name=15:3></a> Since I first proposed treating this point, the subject has been taken up in the "Bible Treasury.<a name=15:4></a>" But, having the wish to go farther into the statements of scripture than is there done, and, having long had my mind occupied with it, this does not hinder my pursuing it myself.<a name=15:5></a> The ground of the view there given, and of the following paper, I apprehend to be the same; but it will easily be seen how entirely independent they are one of another.<a name=15:6></a>

		The thought that admission into the house conferred the privileges of the body has been the root of the systematic corruption of Christianity, which has acquired the reverence of ages, was not shaken off at the Reformation, and is now corrupting the Protestant systems, which were thought to have freed themselves from its fetters.<a name=15:7></a> All the members of the body of Christ are living members, quickened of the Spirit, or born of God; they are forgiven all their sins, and perfected for ever by His one offering of Himself; they have received His Spirit, and are heirs of the inheritance of glory.<a name=15:8></a> If the body and the house are the same thing, then all that are admitted into the house, be they adults or infants, have part in the privileges which belong to the body.<a name=15:9></a> On the other hand, being true members of the body of Christ secures nothing; for its true members may perish.<a name=15:10></a> The very idea of being born of God is destroyed; for, after having been born of God, they lose what they had, and have to be born over again, without the alleged means of being so, or they enter the kingdom of heaven, as they say, without life; the abiding efficacy of

		The first general idea, that of which we are to speak, is the Church (<i>e ekklesia</i>).<a name=16:2></a> The word, however, I shall at once drop, and employ the literal rendering of the Greek word so translated: the Assembly.<a name=16:3></a> Technical words obtain a conventional meaning, which introduces great confusion into people's minds; for, though the local growth of thought produces language, in moral education, words become names, and create rather than express ideas.<a name=16:4></a> Take, as an instance, this word Church.<a name=16:5></a> It is applied, as all know, to buildings appropriated to ecclesiastical services.<a name=16:6></a> But the church is the house of God; and the building is treated as the house of God, though God has expressly declared that, under the Christian system, He will not dwell in temples made with hands; that where two or three are gathered together in His name -- the true church so far, and so called in the passage -- there Christ is in their midst.<a name=16:7></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#16:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>In this and a few other cases the charge of intentional departure from a plain translation, through prejudice, or a fear of doing mischief perhaps, cannot be escaped, in respect to the (generally-speaking) admirable translation which we possess in English. I know of none better, unless perhaps the Dutch, which, made about eight years afterwards, has evidently profited by the English; perhaps by Bengel's of the New Testament, which is done with very great care, but not in use. The reformed German translation of *Piscator* is a very good one. It has alas! even in the reformed churches, given place to Luther's, which is the very worst translation I know. The French are all very mediocre; Diodati's, the most exact, but old and even incorrect French; but the truth is, that the French language is singularly unfitted for the translation of scripture. It may be exact, and no doubt is; but it is the narrow exactitude of man's mind. Diodati's, being far more exact to the original, is consequently intolerable as French. I may cite as examples, not of mistaken translation, which human infirmity is, of course, exposed to, but of false. Acts 1: 22, "Must one be ordained to be": ordained to be, is not the original at all. Acts 3: 19, "When the times," instead of "So that." This may have been from not knowing what to make of it; but it is a false translation. 2 Thessalonians 2, The day of Christ is "at hand," instead of "is come," or, "come upon" [you]. The word is used more than once for "present," in contrast with things to come, and always for present. The whole teaching of the epistle, I hesitate not to say, here depends on it. Again, they have been afraid to put "heavenly places" in Ephesians 6: 12, in the text. The avoiding the word bishops ("overseers"), Acts 20, is of the same character. I mention only such as occur to my memory at the moment.

		The word Assembly is one known to Old Testament language and thought.<a name=17:1></a> Yet it had there a very different character and foundation.<a name=17:2></a> Two words are there employed, which, it seems to me, give somewhat different ideas, <i>hedah</i> and <i>kahal</i>.<a name=17:3></a> The former seems to me to present rather the corporate unity of the congregation; the latter, the actual gathering, pretty much the difference which we might understand between an Assembly and an Assemblage.<a name=17:4></a> <i>Moed</i> is another thought; the meeting, the tent of meeting; because there they met God, and, indeed, one another; but the thought in the word is an appointed place of meeting.<a name=17:5></a> Israel was the assembly of God, but they were it by birth; though excluded, if not circumcised.<a name=17:6></a> All this for the time was set aside we may say, by the death of Christ, though the patience of God lingered, by means of the intercession of Christ upon the cross over the beloved people (compare Acts 3).<a name=17:7></a> The prophets had indeed spoken of all this beforehand, and he among them who unfolded the destinies of Israel, and their several causes more fully than any one, Isaiah, tells all through of a remnant that should be spared, the children and disciples given to Messiah, when all was darkness in the nation, and the testimony of God shut up, save to that remnant, thus separated from the people, while God Himself hid His face from them.<a name=17:8></a> This remnant would in future days return; and for their sakes Israel be spared, and the glory of the nation be established in them (see Isaiah 6: 9-13; chapter 8: 15-18; chapter 10: 21, 22; chapter 65: 8, 9, and chapter 66).<a name=17:9></a> Chapter 8 shews us that, when the nation was set aside, this remnant came distinctively on the scene.<a name=17:10></a> They were for signs to both houses of Israel.<a name=17:11></a>

		Thus far, however, we have the assembly as built up by Christ on the earth (though for heaven; but it is not built in heaven, nor presented as connected with a head there), in contrast with the presenting Messiah to the Jews, on the ground of their own promises, as come in the flesh, the seed of David according to the flesh.<a name=23:4></a> Peter (in Acts 3) proposes, indeed, to the nation to come in and enjoy the promises on this ground, and Christ would return on their repentance.<a name=23:5></a> This is founded on Christ's intercession, "Father, forgive them"; but they resist the Spirit, as their fathers had done; and this part of their history closes.<a name=23:6></a>

		Hence we find, in the writings of the apostle Paul, very distinct additional light on other important aspects of God's assembly (Ephesians 1: 22).<a name=24:5></a> It is the body of which Christ is the Head, the fulness of Him who fills all in all.<a name=24:6></a> True Christians, viewed as a whole, are "the body of Christ, and members in particular.<a name=24:7></a>" This is fully unfolded in 1 Corinthians 12; "For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ.<a name=24:8></a>" We are taught also how this most important truth is made good: "For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body.<a name=24:9></a>" The apostle unfolds and insists on this in the following verses of the chapter.<a name=24:10></a> In Ephesians 4 we learn, that the body makes increase of itself to the edifying of itself in love.<a name=24:11></a> The mutuality of membership is dwelt on also in Romans 12.<a name=24:12></a> In a word, the assembly (which, remark, already existed, for Jesus had spoken to him of the saints he was persecuting) is looked at in its true living character, the body of Christ; and it is so through the baptism of the Holy Ghost.<a name=24:13></a> In the Ephesians, however, when the body is fully spoken of, the apostle refers to the elect saints, who are created again in Christ Jesus, and are sealed for the day of redemption; that is, he sees the assembly, when speaking of it as the body of Christ united to the Head, as God knows it; quickened, raised, and seated in heavenly places in Christ the Head.<a name=24:14></a> That which

		It is in this last way the assembly is viewed in Ephesians 1, as is the case in respect of the subjects of the whole chapter, though that which the true heirs and members of Christ possess meanwhile is doubtless stated, but only in view of this ultimate purpose of God, and not what refers to the sphere of their earthly responsibility: of that there is nothing in the chapter at all.<a name=29:3></a> The thoughts, purpose, and counsels of God are its subject.<a name=29:4></a> The beginning of chapter 2 shews that by which those once dead in trespasses and sins are brought into the blessed place which these counsels have bestowed on us.<a name=29:5></a> From verse 11 of chapter 2, though still addressing saints, he speaks of their actual condition and position in fact down here on the earth -- their present actual place.<a name=29:6></a> The Gentiles were made nigh, the middle wall of partition broken down in the cross, that Christ might reconcile Jews and Gentiles in one body to God; then the message of peace sent to both, so that we both have access by one Spirit to the Father.<a name=29:7></a> They are fellow-citizens of the saints and of the household of God, built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets of the New Testament, Christ being the corner-stone, in whom all the building, fitly framed together, groweth unto a holy temple in the Lord, in whom they also were builded together for a dwelling-place of God through the Spirit.<a name=29:8></a> Now doubtless the thought here presented is the normal state of the assembly upon the earth: scripture would thus, speaking of it in principle, so describe it (it could not do otherwise); but we are here on quite other ground than in the first.<a name=29:9></a> We have not the purpose and counsel of God, but facts wrought and a system established upon the earth, in which men have their part, such as they are here below.<a name=29:10></a> Those whom he addresses were builded together to be a dwelling-place of God on the earth.<a name=29:11></a> The temple had been such in another way.<a name=29:12></a> Now it is another, a Christian dwelling-place, which God has by the Spirit.<a name=29:13></a>

		I would refer the reader, in order to complete this review, to Ephesians 5; where the love of Christ towards the assembly, viewed as the object of divine counsels and the bride of Christ, with allusion to Eve's relationship with Adam, is unfolded: first, in its whole character and results He loved it, gave Himself for it that He might cleanse it for Himself by the word, and present it to Himself (as God did Eve, when formed, to Adam), glorious and spotless: secondly, in His tender care over it, He nourishes and cherishes it as a man would his own flesh.<a name=39:3></a> In chapter 4 we find the gifts coming down from Christ as Head; these gifts being represented as the members themselves ministering, first, to the perfection of the individual members; and, then, with a view to the work of the ministry and the edifying the whole body by the supply of every part.<a name=39:4></a> I would recall the triple unity heretofore spoken of: the body, the Spirit, and the hope; the one Lordship of Christ to which faith and baptism correspond; then, one divine being, God and Father of us all, who is above all, and everywhere, and in us all.<a name=39:5></a> Wonderful privilege!<a name=39:6></a> There remains the question, What has historically become of the assembly thus formed?<a name=39:7></a> and what form did the thoughts connected with it take in the minds of Christian men?<a name=39:8></a> Of this in another paper, the Lord willing.<a name=39:9></a>

		In essaying to accomplish the task which I had undertaken, of giving, in its main element at least, an historical view of the doctrines progressively held regarding the Church, the assembly of God, I was, I confess, hardly aware of the poverty of the resources to which I should be reduced when once I left scripture.<a name=39:10></a> As doctors, I had no great confidence in the Fathers; I had consulted them, at any rate, too much for that.<a name=39:11></a> But I thought that, on the subject of the Church, I should find (not surely what had the truth and depth of scripture, it would have been alike unjust and wrong, but), at any rate, an energy of thought and apprehension, which, if flowing in a channel traced out by human thought, and occupied with an earthly establishment of divine things, would still rise above temporary

It is, he says previously, the accustomed operation as to the salvation of men, which is in one faith; it may be effectual operation, as some read it. It is added, "Wherefore, those who do not participate in Him (the Spirit, who is truth) are not nourished by the mother's breasts into life, nor receive the bright fountain proceeding from the body of Christ." Here remark: Irenaeus, who is occupied with the heretics, states, that heretics are not the Church at all, and hence have not what is found in the Church; she alone nourishes into life. The good father reasons in an evident circle. The Church is where the Spirit is, and where the Spirit is is the Church; but there is the honest earnest consciousness of faith. They are not the Church, for they have not the faith; therefore, they have not the Spirit. But the faith was proved by the Church's traditions too.

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But all this would be always true, even if there were not a Church upon earth.<a name=76:10></a> That is, it is one thing that there are individuals saved, children of God, heirs of glory in heaven; quite another is their union with Christ, so as to be members of His body, of His flesh, and of His bones; and yet another it is to be the habitation of God through the Spirit.<a name=76:11></a> We will speak of these latter points.<a name=76:12></a>

		Now it is necessary, before speaking of the state of the Church as it was at the beginning, to notice a difference which is found in the word of God as to the house.<a name=80:12></a> The Lord said, "Upon this rock I will build my church.<a name=80:13></a>" It is Christ Himself who builds His Church; and consequently the gates of hades shall not prevail against it.<a name=80:14></a><a href="#80:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a> Here it is not man who builds, but Christ.<a name=80:15></a> Wherefore the apostle Peter, speaking of the spiritual house, says nothing of the workmen, "To whom coming as unto a living stone .<a name=80:16></a>.<a name=80:17></a>.<a name=80:18></a> ye also as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood," 1 Peter 2.<a name=80:19></a> This is the work of grace in the heart of the individual by which man approaches Christ.<a name=80:20></a> Accordingly, once more, in the Acts it is said that "the Lord added to the Church daily such as should be saved.<a name=80:21></a>" This work could not fail, being the work of God, efficacious for eternity, and manifested in its time.<a name=80:22></a> We read, moreover, in Ephesians 2, "Built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner-stone; in whom all the building, fitly framed together, groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord.<a name=80:23></a>" This building which grows may be manifested before the eyes of men; but if the effect of this work of efficacious grace is not manifested in its exterior unity before men, God will not for that fail to do His work, gathering His children for eternal life.<a name=80:24></a> Souls come to Christ and are built upon Him.<a name=80:25></a>

		The apostles John and Paul, and more particularly the latter, speak of a unity manifested before men in testimony to men of the power of the Holy Ghost.<a name=81:1></a> In John 17 we read, "Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word, that they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.<a name=81:2></a>" Here the unity of the children of God is a testimony borne to the world, that God has sent Jesus in order that the world may believe.<a name=81:3></a> Now this truth is, consequently, the evident duty of God's children.<a name=81:4></a> All know how the state opposed to this truth is a weapon in the hands of the enemies of this truth.<a name=81:5></a>

		The character of the house and the doctrine of the responsibility of men are still more clearly taught in the word of God.<a name=81:6></a> Paul says, "Ye are God's building.<a name=81:7></a> According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise master-builder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon.<a name=81:8></a> But let every one take heed how he buildeth thereupon.<a name=81:9></a>" Here it is men who build.<a name=81:10></a> The house of God is manifested on earth.<a name=81:11></a> The Church is the building of God; but we find there not only God's work (that is, those who come to God moved by the Holy Ghost), but also the effect of the work of men, who have often built with wood, hay, and stubble.<a name=81:12></a> Men have confused together the exterior house built by men and the work of Christ, which may indeed be identical with the work of men, but it may also differ widely.<a name=81:13></a> False teachers attributed all the privileges of the body of Christ to the great house composed of every sort of iniquity and of corrupt men.<a name=81:14></a> But this fatal error does not destroy the responsibility of men as regards the house of God, His habitation through the Spirit; any more than it is destroyed in respect of the manifestation of the unity of the Spirit in one body on earth.<a name=81:15></a>

		The evil of the heart of man soon appeared; and Ananias and Sapphira, as also the murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration, manifested that the sin of man's heart joined to the devil's work was still working in the bosom of the Church.<a name=82:6></a> But at the same time the Holy Spirit was in the Church and acted there, and was sufficient for putting out evil and changing it into good.<a name=82:7></a> The Church however was one, known by the world; and one could say that the apostles, having been let go, went to their own company.<a name=82:8></a> One only Church, filled with the Holy Ghost, bore testimony to the salvation of God and to His presence on earth; and to this Church God added all those who were to be saved.<a name=82:9></a> This Church was all scattered abroad because of the persecution, save the apostles who abode at Jerusalem.<a name=82:10></a> Then God raised up Paul to be His messenger unto the Gentiles.<a name=82:11></a> He begins to build the Church among the Gentiles, and teaches that in it there is neither Gentile nor Jew, but that all are one and the same body in Christ.<a name=82:12></a> Not only the existence of the Church among the Jews, but still more the doctrine of the Church, of its unity, of the union of Jews with Gentiles in one body, is proclaimed and put in execution.<a name=82:13></a> It was the object of the counsels of God already before the foundation of the world, but hidden in God; a mystery which had been hid from the ages in God, to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the Church the manifold wisdom of God:

		THE CHURCH -- THE HOUSE AND THE BODY
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It seems to me that a few words now as to the Church, though not bringing forward anything entirely new, will be opportune.<a name=91:1></a> The question of the Church is agitated in every sense; and those who favour the popish or high-church view of it profit by certain expressions which some find it difficult to explain.<a name=91:2></a> My notice of the subject will be brief.<a name=91:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two points to be considered which comprehend all that with which I am at present occupied.<a name=91:4></a> The first is one which I have heretofore noticed, and on which the confusion and discord rest that agitate believing protestantism; namely, the identifying the house with the body, or the outward thing here on earth (including all who profess Christianiy and all baptized) with the inward thing, or that which is united to Christ by the Holy Ghost.<a name=91:5></a> The other is taking the figure of a building (as scripture does), and then confounding what Christ Himself builds with what is the fruit of the work of building externally -- here on earth entrusted to the responsibility of man.<a name=91:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Confusion on the first point seems to me to have been the origin of the whole system of popery, in its leading feature; and the Reformation did not get clear of it.<a name=91:7></a> I mean the attributing the privileges of the body to every one who was externally introduced into the outward profession of Christianity -- to every baptized person.<a name=91:8></a> At the beginning it was so in fact: the Lord added daily to the Church such as should be saved.<a name=91:9></a> There was no principle involved in this.<a name=91:10></a> It was the Lord's own work; and, of course, was done really and perfectly.<a name=91:11></a> What He did with the spared ones at the close of the Jewish dispensation was, not to take them to heaven, as He will at the close of the present period, but to add them to the assembly which He had formed.<a name=91:12></a> There can be no reasonable doubt they were added outwardly by baptism, as it was the known regular way of doing so.<a name=91:13></a> These as introduced by the Lord, surely, had really part in all the privileges which were found in the body they were added to.<a name=91:14></a> The sacramental and the vital system remained undistinguished; and indeed in certain respects undeveloped, for there was no Gentile yet received, nor was the unity of the body taught.<a name=91:15></a> All was there that was given; for the Holy Ghost had come down, but was, as a fact,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But this soon ceased to be the case.<a name=92:4></a> The Simon Maguses and false brethren crept in unawares, and sacramental introduction and real enjoyment of privilege became distinct.<a name=92:5></a> All who were introduced by baptism were not members of the body of Christ nor had really eternal life.<a name=92:6></a> I do not say they enjoyed no advantages.<a name=92:7></a> They enjoyed much every way, but it only turned to increased condemnation, and, according to Jude, they were the seed of judgment as regards the Church: of this scripture is thus witness.<a name=92:8></a> Such remains as we have of the primitive Church shew that this question, or difference, was wholly lost.<a name=92:9></a> They contended for truth against heresy, as Irenaeus; for unity, in fact, in what existed, as Ignatius (though most of what is ordinarily read of his is clearly, I judge, spurious).<a name=92:10></a> Both were right in the main, but that doctrine which Paul upheld with difficulty against Judaizers, and, in general, the doctrine of one body (of which Christ was the head, and those personally sealed with the Holy Ghost the members), was lost; and, in general, the rights of the body were attributed to all the baptized.<a name=92:11></a> I say in general, for the true privileges of the body had disappeared from their minds altogether.<a name=92:12></a> If they kept the great elements of the faith, and Gnosticism (the denial of the humanity, or of the divinity, of Christ) were warded off, they were glad; while Platonism (through the means of Justin Martyr, Origen, and Clement) corrupted sufficiently within.<a name=92:13></a> But the effect was evident.<a name=92:14></a> The outward body became the Church, and whatever was held of privilege was attributed to all the baptized.<a name=92:15></a>

		The essential difference of the synoptical Gospels and John's is that the three former shew us Christ presented to the responsibility of man, and especially of the Jews in this world, with the result; while John's assumes the Jews to be reprobates, and developes sovereign grace and electing love in connection with the person of the Son of God as a man in this world, which, and not merely Judaism, is now seen as its sphere, and the gift of the Holy Ghost consequent on His going away.<a name=103:3></a> There is this peculiar to Luke amongst the first three, that in the first two chapters we have the deeply interesting picture of the godly remnant in Israel; then Christ traced up to Adam (not from Abraham and David) and grace comes out as revealed to man in Him more fully.<a name=103:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the Gospel of Matthew (which especially speaks of Christ as Emmanuel, Messiah), the narrative, which develops great principles more than facts in historical order, is arrived, in the chapter I refer to, at the point where the Jews had practically rejected the Saviour; so that (verse 20) He charges the disciples that they should no longer tell that He was the Christ, and proceeds to shew His disciples that He must suffer; and the substitution of the Church and the kingdom of heaven for the Jewish system (in chapter 16), and the coming glory of the Son of man in His kingdom (in chapter 17) are brought before us by the Spirit of God.<a name=103:5></a> The Church and the kingdom of heaven form, consequently, the weighty revelation of the Lord in chapter 16.<a name=103:6></a> On this let us dwell for a moment.<a name=103:7></a>

		This leads me to another point in connection with this passage.<a name=108:4></a> It is a personal matter with Simon the son of Jonas.<a name=108:5></a> He was blessed by the revelation from the Father, and the keys of the kingdom were given to him; he was Peter, he only so designated of the Lord.<a name=108:6></a> To him, and to him only were given the keys or administration of the kingdom of heaven; what he, Simon, bound on earth would be bound in heaven, what he should loose would be loosed.<a name=108:7></a> He was the first confidential and divinely guided servant of the Master of the house.<a name=108:8></a> That was wholly personal to him, as the revelation of Christ by the Father to him was.<a name=108:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But the sanction of Heaven on loosing and binding on earth is declared, in another place, to belong to another depository of power where it is not personal, which does not refer to the kingdom but to the Church, and which (if granted of God's grace) may be found at any time while Christianity subsists, namely, wherever two or three are gathered together in Christ's name, because Christ is there in the midst of them.<a name=108:10></a> This is no personal authority of any or all the members, but of an assembly because Christ is in their midst.<a name=108:11></a> The language of the passage is so plain that there would be no difficulty to any one, if habits of thought had not clothed it with a meaning which its language leaves no room for.<a name=108:12></a> If a brother should offend, the offended one was to seek to gain him; if this failed, he was to take one or two more, so that it might not rest on the injured one's statement alone, if it had to come into judgment.<a name=108:13></a> If this failed, he was to tell it to the assembly; if he refused to hear the assembly, he was to be counted as a heathen man.<a name=108:14></a> The Christian assembly took the place of the synagogue, and, where the assembly had acted, the judgment (till repentance) was final; the offender was held to be outside as a heathen.<a name=108:15></a> First, one was to go, then he with others, then the assembly to be informed of it.<a name=108:16></a> It was the discipline of the gathered saints in any given place; and, to make the matter precise, we are told that, wherever two or three are gathered in His name, Christ is in the midst of them.<a name=108:17></a> Nothing really can be simpler.<a name=108:18></a> There is not a word of clergy, nor ministers (however useful these latter may be by their gifts for service), nothing even of

		A special case in connection with this is that of forgiving sins, only collaterally connected, after all, with the general authority of binding and loosing conferred on Simon.<a name=109:9></a> Forgiveness is much more directly connected with the communication of the Holy Ghost and the mission of the apostles in John 20.<a name=109:10></a> Matthew 16 has no direct reference to it.<a name=109:11></a> In Matthew 18 it comes as necessarily administratively involved in it, of which anon.<a name=109:12></a> John 20 was the general mission of the apostles, which, as we have seen, had the forgiveness of sins for a principal object; indeed, as to the individual's state, repentance and remission of sins embraced the whole circle of its testimony, both of course in the name of Jesus.<a name=109:13></a> The apostles acted with the Lord's authority in this matter, Paul (as is fully declared by himself) coming in to partake of it from Christ Himself.<a name=109:14></a> But this forgiveness had a double character.<a name=109:15></a>

		I ought not to think of sinning in future; it is a misapprehension, leading to a reference to the time of the fault and the then change of the state of the individual needed for forgiveness, but shuns its meritorious cause, instead of seeing one perfect work accepted of God as its ground, a work perfect and complete as accomplished by Christ for believers before or believers after, before believed in a hoped for, now accomplished and believed in, righteousness, revealed and accomplished propitiation.<a name=110:1></a> If I will speak of time, all my sins were future when Christ bore them.<a name=110:2></a> But the true way is to see a complete work accepted of God, in the acceptance and sweet savour of which we always stand.<a name=110:3></a> God for Christ's sake (in Christ) has forgiven us.<a name=110:4></a> This was the grand testimony of Christianity.<a name=110:5></a> Called thereby to repentance, men had received the remission of their sins by faith in Christ and they were to be remembered no more.<a name=110:6></a> They were justified.<a name=110:7></a> But, besides reconciliation with God and man by the precious blood of the cross, there is the government of God's children.<a name=110:8></a>

		God withdraws not His eyes from the righteous, says Elihu to Job and then enlarges upon the ways of God in chastening the righteous, and their restoration to blessing on their humiliation under His hand -- just the lesson Job had to learn, and which is taught us in that book.<a name=110:9></a> The three friends insisted that this world was an adequate witness of the dealings of God with man as to good and evil, and hence that Job was a hypocrite.<a name=110:10></a> But we learn in it that when a man is righteous in God's sight, then it is that the dealings of God have their place for his practical profit and the acquirement of self-knowledge; that whom the Lord loves He chastens, and scourges every son whom He receives.<a name=110:11></a> This connects the idea of forgiveness or the contrary (not at all with imputation of sin as guilt, and condemnation as the consequence), but with the present infliction of chastisement, in displeasure doubtless, wrath if you please, in the righteous.<a name=110:12></a> If we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged of the Lord, but when we (Christians) are judged, we are chastened of the Lord that we might not be condemned with the world.<a name=110:13></a> When this chastening, or the forgiveness which is connected with relieving any one from it, is confounded with the forgiveness by which we are accepted and reconciled to God, redemption is not known at all: I do not say, intentionally denied, but not known at all.<a name=110:14></a> A conscience purged by the blood of Christ has no more to do

		Let us see what scripture says of forgiveness in respect of these dealings of God with the righteous, whether using the word forgiveness, or practically referring to the thing.<a name=111:7></a> The whole book of Job is a history of it.<a name=111:8></a> I quote particularly chapter 33, "He openeth the ears of men and sealeth their instruction, that he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man.<a name=111:9></a> He keepeth back his soul from the pit .<a name=111:10></a>.<a name=111:11></a>.<a name=111:12></a> he is chastened also with pain upon his bed .<a name=111:13></a>.<a name=111:14></a>.<a name=111:15></a> .<a name=111:16></a> If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand to shew unto man his uprightness, then he is gracious to him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom .<a name=111:17></a>.<a name=111:18></a>.<a name=111:19></a> He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him, and he shall see his face with joy.<a name=111:20></a>" Here the man is not spoken of as righteous; but the dealings are in grace for correction; and when set right, the hand of God is removed from upon him.<a name=111:21></a> In chapter 36 it is expressly the righteous man who is dealt with.<a name=111:22></a> Again then He opens their ear to discipline, and if they obey and serve Him, they shall spend their days in prosperity; if they obey not, they shall perish with the sword and die without knowledge.<a name=111:23></a> The Psalms are full of this principle; it is, so to speak, their main subject, though founded on atonement.<a name=111:24></a> "Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O Jehovah, and teachest him out of thy law; that thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity," Psalm 94.<a name=111:25></a> "Jehovah hath chastened me sore, but he hath not given me over unto death," Psalm 118.<a name=111:26></a> "Thou wast a God that forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions.<a name=111:27></a>"

		In the New Testament we have a positive intelligent intervention of the saints in the administration of this forgiveness.<a name=111:28></a> First, indeed, men are called upon to judge themselves that they may not come under chastisement (1 Corinthians 11: 31, 32).<a name=111:29></a> But we have two cases where other saints have to say to it, besides apostolic power: discipline, and the supplication of

		brethren, or the elders’ prayer of faith.<a name=112:1></a> And first, in respect of discipline, the wicked man had been put out from the midst of the assembly.<a name=112:2></a> This, while purifying the assembly from evil, had brought the offender to his senses, and he was profoundly humbled about his sin.<a name=112:3></a> The apostle directs the assembly to forgive him; the punishment had been sufficient, and they were again to shew their love to him.<a name=112:4></a> It was no question of his being the righteousness of God, or of his part in it, but of the government of the Church, and the maintenance of its holiness here below.<a name=112:5></a> The wicked man could not enjoy in his wickedness the blessed privileges that belonged to it.<a name=112:6></a> He was excluded; now, humbled and penitent, he was to be forgiven.<a name=112:7></a> It was the present administration and government of the Church down here, and sanctioned of heaven.<a name=112:8></a> At the same time the apostle uses his apostolic authority; and as he had judged the case himself, so now he forgives (2 Corinthians 2: 7, 10).<a name=112:9></a> He had the same authority as that given to the apostles in John 20, and the assembly at Corinth was to exercise concurrently its own in dealing with the case.<a name=112:10></a> The apostle was careful there should be no jar between the two.<a name=112:11></a> This is the force of verses 10, 11.<a name=112:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The intervention of any Christian, in favour of a sinning brother, we find in 1 John 5.<a name=112:13></a> A sin may bring death on a Christian, bodily death in this world, and that in a twofold way irremediably, so that he cannot be prayed for because of the character of the sin (such were Ananias and Sapphira); or, it may result in death, if he be not humbled; as we find in Job, "because there is wrath beware, lest he take thee away with a stroke.<a name=112:14></a>" If they obey not, they shall perish; that is, when He opens their ear to discipline.<a name=112:15></a> The Christian is expected here to discern where the sin has a character which draws out terror and indignation, not intercession.<a name=112:16></a> But if it is a sin not to death, though unrepented of, it may lead to the sinning brother's being cut off, taken away with a stroke; then prayer is to be made, and the life of the sinning brother will be spared.<a name=112:17></a> He is in this sense forgiven.<a name=112:18></a> The threatened result of His sin is turned aside by the intercession.<a name=112:19></a> So, in Job 42: 8, the effect of God's displeasure is to be averted by the intercession of Job.<a name=112:20></a> In James it is the elders’ prayer of faith.<a name=112:21></a> A Christian was sick, he was to send for the elders of the assembly, and they were, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord, to pray for him, and the prayer of faith would

		restore the sick to health, the Lord would raise him up, and, if he had committed sins, they would be forgiven him; evidently implying that if those sins had been the occasion of his sickness, it would not hinder the efficacy of the prayer, but the sins would be forgiven, and the man restored to health.<a name=113:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have thus the various phases of administrative forgiveness.<a name=113:2></a> God, in His government, no longer held the offender liable to judgment according to that government exercised here below, not as a question of acceptance in Christ, but the government of His children.<a name=113:3></a> It might be chastening from Himself, or it might be also the assembly's discipline.<a name=113:4></a> It does not refer to final judgment: the believer has boldness for the day of judgment, because as Christ is, so is he in this world; but he is (as calling on the Father, and knowing he is redeemed by the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without spot and without blemish) to pass the time of his sojourning here in fear, for the Father judges every man according to his works.<a name=113:5></a> Now, as regards the final judgment, the Father judges no man, but has committed all judgment to the Son; but there is the judgment of our ways in the path towards the glory obtained by Christ for us.<a name=113:6></a> There is a judgment of the ways of all.<a name=113:7></a> The unrepentant are heaping up wrath against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men, but God withdraws not His eyes from the righteous, and it is our God who is a consuming fire.<a name=113:8></a> Where true gold is, it purges away the dross.<a name=113:9></a> There may be tribulation for good, in which we can glory; there may be chastening for actual transgression, under which we have to humble ourselves; there may be discipline which applies correctively to our state, and even, as in the case of Paul, anticipates the evil for our blessing.<a name=113:10></a> We have to distinguish the absolute forgiveness and acceptance of the believer from the forgiveness which applies to divine discipline, or even church discipline when we are accepted, the effect of the eyes of God being on the righteous.<a name=113:11></a> The denial of the fulness of the former is the great plague of modern Christianity.<a name=113:12></a> It will be resisted and calumniated as every important truth will; but if the word of God be true, being justified by faith, we have peace with God, and are purged, have no more conscience of sins, by one offering are perfected for ever.<a name=113:13></a> This the Old Testament saints did not know.<a name=113:14></a> Christianity is the revelation of the righteousness of God.<a name=113:15></a> It is that that made the apostle boast of it (Romans 1: 17).<a name=113:16></a> It was then that righteousness was

		declared.<a name=114:1></a> God's discipline, and the assembly's judgment (for it judges those within), forgiveness as to present displeasure with the conduct of the children, come in when acceptance is perfect and apply to the righteous and accepted children.<a name=114:2></a> In the Old Testament these were not distinguished with the same clearness, because the full remission of sins was not yet revealed,<a href="#114:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> nor divine righteousness; so that this distinction could not be brought out, for it depended on that remission and standing in righteousness, our entrance into the holiest through the rent veil.<a name=114:3></a> Hence even protestants who have not the consciousness of this standing are at a loss as to forgiveness.<a name=114:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Some remarks may have their just place here.<a name=114:5></a> First, it may be remarked that all the chastening is from God's hand, even when wicked men are the instruments urged on by Satan God it is who has set Satan at work as an instrument, as we see in the book of Job.<a name=114:6></a> The interpreter, the man of prayer, may be the means of removing the evil, but no human authority imposes any.<a name=114:7></a> Chastening discipline is the judgment of the Lord, a Father's hand upon His child; it has nothing to do with the Church, nor the Church with it.<a name=114:8></a> The Church or assembly only acts on proof of evil by putting out from itself, and so clearing itself, and bringing back when the person is humbled.<a name=114:9></a> It judges those within, and forgives when there is just ground for it.<a name=114:10></a> The Lord chastens in love, to make us partakers of His holiness.<a name=114:11></a> He forgives and removes the chastening, when there is just occasion for that.<a name=114:12></a> An individual's prayer may avert death when wrath is there, or the prayer of the elders of the Church, if the prayer of faith may restore to health when sickness is discipline, and forgiveness be granted.<a name=114:13></a> God may see occasion to inflict permanent chastisement, as Jacob halted all his life.<a name=114:14></a> Full remission of sins was not known under the Old Testament; its announcement is of the essence of Christianity, and peace with God through justification.<a name=114:15></a> An unjustified believer is a contradiction in terms: all that believe are justified; but justification, if it be more, is certainly imputing no sin.<a name=114:16></a> Blessed is the man whose iniquity is forgiven, whose sin is pardoned; blessed is the man to whom the Lord imputes no sin; but to him that believes in Him that justifies the ungodly, his faith is imputed to Him for righteousness.<a name=114:17></a>

		Church in all ages, there are often things which the simple are taught which are hid from the wise and prudent.<a name=117:1></a> That the evils of a depraved nature are attached to and to be contended with by the "separating brethren" is certainly not new; that they have to contend with the snare of the enemy, who would take advantage of their ignorance and weakness but for One who helps them, is equally true, and they are in a measure conscious of it.<a name=117:2></a> Of this part of the subject the editor of the Christian Journal in all his writings seems to be profoundly ignorant; and it is not to be wondered at, as he continues in a system of which he has seen the evil -- which he has rejoiced at being shaken to the foundations, as a heretical system inconsistent with the progress of the gospel.<a name=117:3></a> The "separating brethren" believe this, and therefore they are dissociated from it.<a name=117:4></a> The editor of the <i>Christian Journal</i> believes it, and he is not dissociated from it.<a name=117:5></a> It cannot therefore be a matter of surprise to them if his eyes are dim to other and greater evils.<a name=117:6></a> Acting on what we know is the real power of faith.<a name=117:7></a> Could the editor of the <i>Christian Journal</i> condemn any one for not being subject to that which he declares to be "inconsistent with the progress of the gospel"?<a name=117:8></a> One would suppose the answer to be easy: to a simple Christian it would be easy -- he would not condemn them.<a name=117:9></a> The answer is, that he does condemn them, and approves of those who remain connected with it and supports that which he says is so.<a name=117:10></a> What can his "separating brethren" see in this but the spirit of the world?<a name=117:11></a> Nor is it anything else.<a name=117:12></a> And since the editor cast off so distinctly his "separating brethren," from whom he was not always so alienated, to throw himself into the hands of the worldly party in the Church, it has been quite manifest to a discerning eye that the spirit and character of the <i>Christian Journal</i> have quite changed, that it is become less spiritual and more worldly, less pressing separation from the world, and more sanctioning continuance in known evil; that it has ceased, comparatively, to press conformity to Christ in order to press conformity to the Church of England.<a name=117:13></a> The latter purpose it may do well, and we will not compete with him in the pursuit of it; we would desire in peace to seek the former: to this the <i>Christian Journal</i> has ceased to be available.<a name=117:14></a> We should not have had formerly as we have in the number, on the leading article of which I am now commenting, a sermon on the text, "Be ye [not] conformed to this world," signed "A Clergyman.<a name=117:15></a>" I do

		The "separating brethren" have felt differently as to the question, and acted differently; they have felt and sorrowfully felt, that they must (the necessity was not of their own making) leave the system the clergy sought to maintain, if they wished to leave the spirit of the world and to walk as Christians.<a name=118:9></a> They did so at cost and sorrow to themselves, the loss of friends and fortune, often of situations in life, and in many instances of home; and always at the cost of bitter and cutting reproach, none of which, but wisdom and prudence, is the character of those who remain: "so long as thou doest well unto thyself, all men will speak well of thee.<a name=118:10></a>"

		But there is a remarkable confession contained in the account: "In the majority of instances they are Israelites, in whom is no guile; and, like the beginners of all other Christian sects, they are more than ordinarily engaged in doing good.<a name=128:2></a>" The character given them I pass by here, though we might fancy there was a little of that sort of 'peevishness,' which is 'hard to please,' in the characteristics of "proud" Israelites in whom is no guile, who are more than ordinarily engaged in doing good; neither can we say that the <i>Christian Journal</i>, while hard to please if such Christians as these he describes do not satisfy it, is empty of expressions of discontent at the "separating brethren," though it may live more in expressions of self-satisfaction, and at the world which denied Christ around it.<a name=128:3></a> But it is not this I would dwell on but that the beginners of all other Christian sects are more than ordinarily engaged in doing good.<a name=128:4></a> Now this is surely an extraordinary circumstance -- that invariably those who leave the church are more assimilated to Christ than others, than those who do not.<a name=128:5></a> Is not this an appalling circumstance in the character of the Church of England, that those who are more than ordinarily engaged in doing good are somehow or other driven out of it, or, in other words, beginners of sects?<a name=128:6></a> Is the selfishness of the system insensible to the fact; that as men become in all ages animated by the Spirit of Christ, they cannot remain in it?<a name=128:7></a> They may have failed in continuing their system in the same character it began.<a name=128:8></a> So did the apostles, because their work hung on the presence of the Spirit of God, and the spirit of the world came in and the Church sank.<a name=128:9></a> So did not popery; so did not the Church of England, because in various degrees they joined the world, and were of its spirit: and the world owned them; and they went with the world, and continued as long as the world bore them, and was satisfied with them.<a name=128:10></a> Hence when the Spirit of God wrought, discontent arose, because it would not bear with the spirit of the world, men became more than ordinarily engaged in doing good, and the Church would not bear that (it was irregular), and they would not give it up, because the Spirit of Christ and the love of Christ constrained them; and <a name=129>[Page 129]</a>

		In the homily on "Common Prayer and Sacraments," we read, "And as for the number of them, if they should be considered according to the exact signification of a sacrament, namely, for visible signs, expressly commanded in the New Testament, whereunto is annexed the promise of free forgiveness of our sins, and of our holiness, and joining in Christ, there be but two; namely, baptism and the supper of the Lord.<a name=153:1></a> For although absolution hath the promise of forgiveness of sin; yet, by the express word of the New Testament, it hath not this promise annexed and tied to the visible sign (I mean laying on of hands), is not expressly commanded in the New Testament to be used in absolution, as the visible signs in baptism and the Lord's supper are, and therefore absolution is no such sacrament as baptism and the communion are.<a name=153:2></a> And though the ordering of ministers hath this visible sign and promise; yet it lacks the promise of remission of sin, as all other sacraments besides the two above named do.<a name=153:3></a> Therefore, neither it, nor any other sacrament else, be such sacraments as baptism and the communion are.<a name=153:4></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now here we have the annexing and tying of promised forgiveness to the visible sign, and this is habitual in the minds of most, as to the eucharist, where a man ought not to come except in full forgiveness.<a name=153:5></a> It is taught in the most objectionable way as to baptism.<a name=153:6></a> Thus "it is certain that children baptized, dying before they commit actual sin, are undoubtedly saved.<a name=153:7></a>"

	<div class="page-number">
		Now I am not here questioning the point of infant's salvation, but adduce it to shew that salvation is annexed to baptism by its own efficacy under all circumstances.<a name=153:8></a> Children who are baptized are undoubtedly saved: no wonder, if they are regenerate and have their sins forgiven them.<a name=153:9></a> As to both then we have the prayer, and the assertion, "Dearly beloved, ye have brought the child to be baptized.<a name=153:10></a> We have prayed that our Lord Jesus Christ would vouchsafe to receive him, to release him of his sins, to sanctify him with the Holy Ghost, to give him the kingdom of heaven, and everlasting life.<a name=153:11></a> Ye have heard also that our Lord Jesus Christ hath promised in gospel to grant all these things that ye have prayed for, which promise He for His part will most surely keep and perform": and then: "Seeing now, dearly beloved brethren, that this child is regenerate," etc.<a name=153:12></a>, and afterwards, "we yield thee hearty thanks, most merciful Father, that it hath pleased thee to regenerate this infant with thy Holy Spirit; to receive <a name=154>[Page 154]</a>

		And in the Catechism the statement is made broadly that the child was made a member of Christ, a child of God, and an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven, which last indeed is made a matter of hope in the baptismal service.<a name=154:3></a> So in confirmation, "Almighty and everlasting God, who hast vouchsafed to regenerate these thy servants by water, and the Holy Ghost, and hast given unto them forgiveness of all their sins.<a name=154:4></a>" And so much is this the case that in the sixteenth article we read, "not every deadly sin willingly committed after baptism is sin against the Holy Ghost and unpardonable.<a name=154:5></a>" Why after baptism, but that baptism was regeneration and the forgiveness of sins?<a name=154:6></a> The whole statement is utter confusion, but it shews the place baptism had in the system.<a name=154:7></a> The prayer in the eucharist service is equally strange.<a name=154:8></a> "Grant us therefore, gracious Lord, so to eat the flesh of thy dear Son Jesus Christ; and to drink His blood, that our sinful bodies may be made clean by His body, and our souls washed through His most precious blood, and that we may ever more dwell in Him, and He in us.<a name=154:9></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now these things really involve most important points of doctrine; they show a continuous system, by which though Christ has died "to reconcile his Father to us," the Church is still praying God may not be angry with it for ever, and seeking by the use of ordinances to make daily available to itself the security of averted wrath.<a name=154:10></a> I do not believe this is a correct view of the gospel, but puts the gospel and the Church in a false, an unchristian, position.<a name=154:11></a> It arises from the necessary sense of unknown and unascertained love and craving for mercy, which its identification with the unbelief of the world imposes on it.<a name=154:12></a> Let it have as much love towards the world as it pleases, but let it have the joy of forgiveness for itself.<a name=154:13></a> I repeat then, it is but the systematic perpetuation of unbelief, I do not say intentionally, but in fact.<a name=154:14></a> By asserting every one to be regenerate and in a state of salvation, it has lost for itself what it is to be regenerate and saved.<a name=154:15></a>

		I would ask godly Church of England men, why on every other occasion, they make use of what is called extempore prayer.<a name=156:6></a> Is the meeting of the saints, the Church, the only place where such guidance and assistance of the Spirit could not be?<a name=156:7></a> Or is it that indeed there is such mixture of the Church with the world that it cannot be; that is, that it is no meeting of the saints at all; and that dependence on the Spirit of God is given up, as in a place unsuited for His presence and help?<a name=156:8></a> The truth is, it is framed for meeting the world, and hence it is public worship: that is, of the world and the saints in the world, not the gathering into one, in any sort, the children of God which were scattered abroad.<a name=156:9></a> And here, while I acknowledge there are many saints in the Church of England, as we find Jonathan the beloved of David mixed up with Saul, I would notice what appears to me a very fatal consequence as to them, of this state of things, and of the whole position of the clergy -- an habitual disregard to convictions of mind.<a name=156:10></a> The system being inevitably and infallibly tied to all these things, they meet every conviction with the feeling, "If I give way to this, I must leave the whole system.<a name=156:11></a>" The consequence is, they endeavour somehow or other to repress, or else to quiet, the conviction by some subtle reasoning or general comforting persuasion -- "I shall do more good by being here" -- but the Spirit of the Lord is grieved, and the honesty of their conscience and judgment impaired in its principles.<a name=156:12></a> If we suppress our conscientious convictions in one thing, it is not in that alone we suppress it, but we suppress the conscience itself, and we weaken the godly spring of judgment in it.<a name=156:13></a> There is not the same nearness to God of our conscience, the surface of it is hardened by the resisted conviction, and nothing tells upon it as it did.<a name=156:14></a> It does not tell so speedily, as by the presence of the

		As to the Galatians, there was nothing corrupt in the Church at all: they received false doctrine from other teachers which the apostle corrected; so of the other evils which arose in the churches.<a name=169:7></a> The apostle corrected them, and so held them together -- an example in the matter, of course.<a name=169:8></a> When corrected, they had no need to separate.<a name=169:9></a> It would have been sheer madness to have corrected the evil, and told them to separate at the same time; a provision for separation, while the Church was planting in holiness, would have been simply denying His apostolic work, which was to form the churches on those principles which have now been departed from, so that which is called the Church is nothing but another aspect of the State.<a name=169:10></a>

		But the Seven Churches "furnish cases exactly in point.<a name=169:11></a>" They do no such thing.<a name=169:12></a> The Seven Churches exhibited churches formed thoroughly on sound principles -- principles of not allowing evil; and because they did not act upon them, they were to be judicially removed out of their place, which they were accordingly.<a name=169:13></a> They formed the next step in church history to the epistles of the apostles, the parting warning from the Lord.<a name=169:14></a> The Epistles afford the example of apostolic energy in maintaining churches rightly planted in their right position of separation from evil, the apostle warning that he knew, that after his decease things would go wrong, and evil arise.<a name=169:15></a> The Seven Churches’ epistles are the judgment of Christ on this subsequent state of things, the Son of man, but judging in the midst of the candlesticks -- churches rightly founded, having generally ceased to be rightly ordered and therefore removed out of their place by the Lord's judgment, making way for the apostasy as "things that should be.<a name=169:16></a>" Removal for practical corruption of a holy thing is the tenor of these epistles, the setting aside the church as standing in its first planting.<a name=169:17></a> But they were "things that are.<a name=169:18></a>" As prophecies, if such, they

		And now as to separating from the Jewish system, and the adherence of Christian Jews to it, we have seen the practice not to have been at all what the editor states it; but this is not all.<a name=171:4></a> There is upon the very ground of the Church being of a heavenly character, and having no portion in this world, a direct summons to go forth out of its now unacknowledged sanctity.<a name=171:5></a> "Christ, therefore [as the sin-offering was burnt without the camp of God] that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate "of what?<a name=171:6></a> of the world?<a name=171:7></a> Nay, of the holy city.<a name=171:8></a> "Let us, therefore, go forth to him without the camp, bearing his reproach.<a name=171:9></a>" It is, when the Church thus is worldly and not heavenly, bearing Christ's.<a name=171:10></a> reproach to go forth without the camp.<a name=171:11></a> The camp was not Egypt, nor the city the world in form; but it was in character; and they, being heavenly "partakers of the heavenly calling," could have no more to say to it.<a name=171:12></a> This then was the positive direction to the Hebrew: separation from evil -- separation from the world, both which are "enmity against God"; but we being "reconciled to God" is the essential character and meaning of the Church.<a name=171:13></a> It was for this Jesus suffered.<a name=171:14></a> "For their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also may be sanctified through the truth.<a name=171:15></a>" It is in this character He is our risen head and priest, "separate from sinners," "no more in the world.<a name=171:16></a>" It is in this people walk, for this the

		As to Jude, the editor's professed love to his "separating brethren" proves that he does not himself believe in its application to them; but our answer is this -- separation from the Church of God we admit not only to be an evil but a totally ruinous evil.<a name=172:6></a> It is to leave the only holy sanctuary of God in the world, and it is the reckless doing and blasphemy of this of which Jude speaks.<a name=172:7></a> Does the editor really believe that the passages in Jude or Peter apply to his "separating brethren"?<a name=172:8></a> If he does not, why does he quote them?<a name=172:9></a> If he does, let him fairly state so.<a name=172:10></a> Either we are not Christians but totally lost persons, or Jude and Peter do not apply at all.<a name=172:11></a> These are the passages he quotes to condemn separation.<a name=172:12></a> They condemn separation from the Church of God -- to mock, and walk after their own ungodly lusts and speak hard words against Christ.<a name=172:13></a> Does this apply to the guileless active Israelites?<a name=172:14></a> If not, it is entirely another conclusion which must be drawn from it -- that the Church of England is not the Church of God at all: if it were, the consequences in Jude would follow; but if not, separation from it, so far from being evil, is but a bounden testimony against the pretences to be such, by which the saints of God are so deceived.<a name=172:15></a> The editor has spoken a bold word in saying that all who separate from the Church of England "are sensual, not having the Spirit.<a name=172:16></a>" Is this his opinion of many of them?<a name=172:17></a> if not, is he not blaspheming them?<a name=172:18></a> much rather, incurring the charge of hard things spoken against Christ in His people?<a name=172:19></a> I count him much more a separatist in truth, who (when saints are trying to walk orderly, devotedly, and in grace) separates himself from them or them from him; because of lying and worldly ceremonies, most of which had long had the sanction of Satan in an evil world, but never that I could learn of God.<a name=172:20></a>

		As to things imposed till the time of reformation, it is hardly worth while to any Christian acquainted with scripture to refer to it.<a name=173:12></a> But I need only remark that, instead of sanctioning the Jewish Christians in the exact observance of their ordinances, the apostle (as is the tenor of the whole epistle) is pressing on them that they had no obligation on them at all, now Christ was come, their calling being heavenly in union with Him, as their High Priest not in this world at all: that they were merely carnal ordinances imposed on them till the time of reformation, figures for the time then present; and that they

		As to the degeneracy of the age, which is noticed and denied in this number, we believe the editor is most awfully and guiltily misleading the Church.<a name=174:7></a> As to Ireland, we have noticed the inconsistency of his statements; and (while it is against the direct testimony of scripture, declaring that things shall go on, as in Noah's days and Lot's days till the Son of man come, days in which men despised warnings as much as the editor does now) nothing but the grossest ignorance of the state of England could lead him to such a statement.<a name=174:8></a> He confesses that crime is largely increased, but he says it is among the rabble.<a name=174:9></a> Yet how comes wickedness to have increased so much among them?<a name=174:10></a> But, in truth, this is the least part of the evil; the universal degeneracy of principle with much profession, and the great progress of infidelity, of atheistical principles, and the spirit of rebellion against lawful power, which is identified with these principles, and the slight of testimony and judgment, the "where is the promise of His coming" (in which the editor takes his part), are far worse signs of apostasy and judgment than the petty acts of evil which are but accompanying results.<a name=174:11></a>

		My Dear Sir, <p>Though I might recount many other adequate causes of my silence since I received your last, yet I must say my chief reason for not being more prompt has arisen from the very uninteresting reply you have given to mine of December 12.<a name=178:2></a> It really appeared to me evasive of discussion.<a name=178:3></a> I asked you, in order that we might come to the argument of the subject at once, to allege your grounds of separation from the communion of the Church of England -- a very straightforward question methinks, and the import of which was very obvious.<a name=178:4></a> But instead of a plain answer, as might have been expected, you occupy a considerable portion of your letter in making reflections on me as "an adversary," as you call me, of whom you add "nothing" (Christian, I suppose, you mean) "is to be expected.<a name=178:5></a>" You then quarrel with my assuming that you have forsaken the Church of England, as though this was not the case (remember, I did not say the Church, but the Church of England); and, lastly, you give out your impressions against the character of the Church of England, erecting them into assertions, and dilating upon a new and better way, as you are pleased to think, adding in the meanwhile not one syllable, not even professing to do it, of argument to bear out your assertions.<a name=178:6></a> Now, my dear sir, I feel from this, as well as the loose character of your former communications to me, that it is vain to expect from you anything like an orderly and intelligible vindication of your views.<a name=178:7></a> In this respect you seem to write as you speak.<a name=178:8></a> I therefore propose for the future, without waiting for such, taking up just as they come your aspersions of the Church of England, and the peculiarities of yourself and brethren as dissenters, sifting them as the Lord may enable me, and bringing out the truth as distinctly as I can, for the perusal of all who may see our correspondence.<a name=178:9></a>

		You can now pretty well understand why I speak not of the world being in the Church of England, but of its being the world and not the Church at all.<a name=194:10></a> It is notorious that, if they be not actually dissenters, the population of a parish, town, or county, if they be in pitch darkness, are all members of the Church of England, so called.<a name=194:11></a> They would call themselves so.<a name=194:12></a> They are called so, and boasted of by their ministers as such.<a name=194:13></a> They are entitled to be received as such, if not notoriously profligate, though they may not be able to tell you who Jesus was, and deny in their ignorance every truth of the gospel.<a name=194:14></a> And that this is a fact, and not a fiction, is known to every one acquainted with the state of the country.<a name=194:15></a> That is, the world, behaving themselves so as not to shock public decency, are entitled to be received at communion, because the system rests on ordinances, not on faith.<a name=194:16></a> And a minister faithful as to the truth he preached would address the whole congregation in the services of the Church of England as his brethren and as the Church; and when preaching to them, perhaps honestly and faithfully tell them they were all unconverted, and unless they repented they would all perish.<a name=194:17></a> In a word, he would address them, when he told his own mind as faithfully serving Christ in the Spirit, as unbelieving sinners; and when he recited the church's forms, and told hers, as congregated saints.<a name=194:18></a> Which is right?<a name=194:19></a> But, first, which is true?<a name=194:20></a> Who is the faithful minister (I put it to your own conscience), the man who in a dark parish, or as to the great body of every parish, preaches the gospel to them as sinners, poor lost sinners, or the minister who treats them all as the congregated Church of God?<a name=194:21></a> The latter minister, on your own statement, and the clear avowal of the Prayer Book, acts in the mind of the Church of England.<a name=194:22></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there are other points connected with this point of theory and discipline, which are to me very important.<a name=195:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are habitually told not to judge, and this sounds well; but it is a very awful and anti-gospel, and at the same time a very hollow, principle.<a name=195:10></a> True it is that I am not to pass a human judgment on a brother, as regards God's final estimate of him; nor to speak, he being before me as such, as to God's present acceptance of him.<a name=195:11></a> This is clear; but to treat all as Christians, because they have been baptized in their infancy and connected with the formularies, is a very uncharitable deception, and you know that as a Christian minister you do not.<a name=195:12></a> The system of your church may do it, but I am persuaded your heart does not; it could not if the Spirit of Christ's love be there: neither then should our acts or words.<a name=195:13></a> They forget that Christianity begins with this, "The love of Christ constraineth us, because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead.<a name=195:14></a>" And if a system of ordinances have concealed these truths, if the Church has learnt to rest in the ordinances in lieu of life and its necessity, it is just in the practical state of apostasy from which I have to flee, in love to my own soul and that of others.<a name=195:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next, I believe that the notion that I cannot recognize brethren as such is an abominable delusion of Satan to the destruction of the grand witness of Christ on the earth.<a name=195:16></a> I am told not to judge who are and who are not.<a name=195:17></a> I answer, the practical recognition of them is the principle of the dispensation.<a name=195:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Knowing that all are dead, the recognition that any are alive is the joy of charity.<a name=196:1></a> Their corporate union and worship is Christ's witness in the earth, "that they may be one, that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.<a name=196:2></a>" And though the disregard of the unity of worship of the saints, known to each other as such, may seem to a carnal man as charity, it really destroys all the first springs of holy affection.<a name=196:3></a> What would come of family affections if all were reduced to uncertainty as to who was a brother and who was not?<a name=196:4></a> How can I greet with cordial affection as of one heart and one mind my brethren in the Lord, if I do not and am not to know who they are?<a name=196:5></a> Is there not, according to scripture, to be some set of people who are all of one heart and one mind?<a name=196:6></a> Is not charity injured, and God's witness of love from each injured and destroyed by this cold and heartless doctrine, that I am not to judge who are brethren and who are not?<a name=196:7></a> Love the brethren, says the Spirit of God.<a name=196:8></a> Nay, I am told you must not judge who are and who are not.<a name=196:9></a> The first precept of charity is annulled by this system, "Hereby shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.<a name=196:10></a>" How can this great witness and test of discipleship be manifested if there be not a mutual recognition by the disciples of the Lord as such?<a name=196:11></a> This fair form of worldly charity is, I believe, a very evil delusion of the enemy.<a name=196:12></a> And is it not the fact that you do judge, preaching to many as unconverted, and conversing with others as saints?<a name=196:13></a> You must do so if you have the Spirit of Christ.<a name=196:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		Further, as to discipline, there is not otherwise a body capable of discipline as led of the Spirit of God, by which alone it can be rightly exercised.<a name=196:15></a> Discipline by a body of unconverted persons is ridiculous.<a name=196:16></a> A remark of your friend Mr.<a name=196:17></a> M'Neil is an evidence of this.<a name=196:18></a> He says, speaking of those who complained of mixed communion, "Have you followed the scriptures?<a name=196:19></a> If your brother has driven you from participating in this ordinance, he has certainly trespassed against you.<a name=196:20></a>" This is a poor and strained way of taking a brother's trespass against me, and it is besides a piece of sophistry; for my difficulty is, not that my brother has trespassed, but that you have by your system gathered a heap of people who are not brethren at all, and would reject and scorn the title of saints in heart and life, so that it is a very poor sophistry.<a name=196:21></a> But let that pass.<a name=196:22></a> "Have you gone to him alone?<a name=196:23></a>" says Mr.<a name=196:24></a> M'Neil, <a name=197>[Page 197]</a>

	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		Now as to one or two objections you make.<a name=197:10></a> First, you refer to Israel.<a name=197:11></a> There was abuse, you say, but they were not to leave it.<a name=197:12></a> In the first place, we are not Jews but Christians.<a name=197:13></a> Judaism was an elect nation; there could be no such thing as leaving it: Christianity is not, but a gathering of saints.<a name=197:14></a> God has not recorded His name in the English nation; but wherever two or three are gathered together in His name, there is Jesus in the midst of them.<a name=197:15></a> What the temple was to a Jew, the gathering of the saints is to me.<a name=197:16></a> My complaint of the Establishment is that it is not, and never was, a gathering of saints.<a name=197:17></a> If a man ceased to be a Jew, he ceased to be of God's people altogether.<a name=197:18></a> That nation and its ordinances were wholly, solely, and exclusively God's people, sanctuary, and place: to leave them was to apostatize from God.<a name=197:19></a> They were gathered, not in spiritual worship, but to carnal ordinances, imposed not by conversion of heart but by Jewish parentage.<a name=197:20></a> The Church of God alone is analogous in one place.<a name=197:21></a> The Establishment has no pretence to be what Israel was as God's only place of abode.<a name=197:22></a> Where Judaism and Christianity are entirely different from each other in principle, in naturalism and obligation of carnal ordinances, there it has followed Judaism, and then uses this as an argument why it should not be left.<a name=197:23></a> If this argument proves anything, it proves its apostasy.<a name=197:24></a> Two or three gathered together in Christ's name have the authority of unity which Israel had of old, not a sorry imitation of that which the gospel treats as beggarly elements, and now equivalent to idolatry (see Galatians 4) and carnal ordinances.<a name=197:25></a> Israel, I repeat, was a national election; Christianity is not.<a name=197:26></a> The laws of the country <a name=198>[Page 198]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		were God's own laws, the presence of God was there, and the abuses and corruptions did not alter that.<a name=198:1></a> A person could not leave it, and be in the place of God's worship and God's ordinance.<a name=198:2></a> Now the place of God's worship and God's ordinance is where two or three are gathered together in Christ's name; and this the Establishment is not, but a provision of ordinances for the population in confessed imitation of Judaism.<a name=198:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next you refer to the seven churches.<a name=198:4></a> This there is more occasion to answer specially, as it is the common resort of argument on the question.<a name=198:5></a> The simple answer is, they were God's churches or assemblies in the place mentioned, and they could not be left; corruptions are no ground for leaving the Church of God.<a name=198:6></a> The Church of God cannot be left, and a man be in the path of salvation in so doing.<a name=198:7></a> These were the churches of God, the assemblies of God, in those different towns-gatherings of saints, although carelessness had introduced corruption.<a name=198:8></a> The Establishment is not this at all.<a name=198:9></a> Were the apostle to address an epistle to the Church of God which is at Liverpool, or London, there is no gathered body distinct from the world who could receive and act upon the letter.<a name=198:10></a> Where the epistle says, Ye have among you such and such, and calls for repentance, were they not to put them out, or would they otherwise have repented?<a name=198:11></a> Where is the body, then, which could act thus, when you are preaching to an indiscriminate heap of unconverted people?<a name=198:12></a> In a word, there was a known body which could act by the leading of the Spirit of God.<a name=198:13></a> There was no direction to leave these churches because they were churches.<a name=198:14></a> The Establishment has no such claim; and I do not leave it properly, but have nothing to say to it, because it is not one.<a name=198:15></a> The Establishment does not, nor ever did, stand on the ground of these churches or local assemblies of God at all, and has no principle of their structure, order, or constitution.<a name=198:16></a> I should think it a great sin to leave a church of God because corruptions were found in it; but the Establishment is a great national, secular system, and not the Church of God at all.<a name=198:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another assertion you make is, I have evil in myself, and that I cannot leave, and therefore it is a hopeless thing to seek purity.<a name=198:18></a> This (forgive me for saying it) is an ugly argument.<a name=198:19></a> There is no hope: we will continue to do evil.<a name=198:20></a> But it is a poor piece of sophistry.<a name=198:21></a> I cannot leave the evil in my flesh, so

		First, as you are aware, the child is pronounced regenerate by the Holy Spirit.<a name=208:3></a> Sometimes it is attempted to say that this is a change of state, not of personal condition.<a name=208:4></a> This is an idle effort.<a name=208:5></a> Were I told, according to the fathers, regenerate means baptized -- though abuse of words produces much mischief: if it were merely meant to say they are baptized, and thereby personally admitted into the pale of the visible Church -- my present argument would not hold.<a name=208:6></a> Baptized persons are certainly baptized.<a name=208:7></a> But I say this is an idle effort.<a name=208:8></a> The congregation are to pray that God will grant to the child that thing which by nature he cannot have; that he may be baptized with the Holy Ghost -- an expression itself full of confusion, but certainly something positive, and personally spiritual; again, that he may be sanctified with the Holy Ghost, that he, being delivered from God's wrath, may be received into the ark of Christ's Church, and being steadfast in faith, etc.<a name=208:9></a>; again, "Give thy Holy Spirit to this infant, that he may be born again, and made an heir of everlasting salvation.<a name=208:10></a>" The congregation are told they have prayed God to release him of his sins, sanctify him with the Holy Ghost, and give him the kingdom of heaven and everlasting life; and Christ, they are told, has promised to grant them.<a name=208:11></a> And passing by other consistent expressions, after the rite, it is stated, the child is regenerate; and they pray he may lead the rest of his life accordingly, and then give hearty thanks that it has pleased the Father to regenerate the infant with the Holy Spirit, and to receive him for His own child by adoption.<a name=208:12></a> What other terms could you use for a saint quickened by God, and made actual partaker of divine life?<a name=208:13></a> The prayer is changed when there has been previous private baptism into "that he being born again -- Give that he may be"; and it is then stated that he is by baptism regenerate.<a name=208:14></a> In the former service the expression is used, that he may receive remission of his sins by spiritual regeneration -- again, confusion of thought as to an infant, but definite in the extent of what is attributed to baptism.<a name=208:15></a> The baptism of such as are of riper years seems to me to seal the confusion, but that is not the question now to occupy us.<a name=208:16></a>

		member of Christ, a child of God, and that by baptism; and therein it was promised he should believe -- the scripture saying we are children of God by faith, not by ordinances.<a name=209:1></a> The child confesses he is bound to believe, and keep God's holy will and commandment, which he will, and thanks God he is in this state of salvation.<a name=209:2></a> Now here faith in certain articles, and keeping the commandments, are obligations on the child, he being (on the proxies undertaken for him) made a child of God by the baptism itself already, where he assented too unqualifiedly that he would keep the commandments.<a name=209:3></a> And the promise of faith afterwards they are stated to be bound to perform.<a name=209:4></a> The Sacrament also he is taught expressly was the means by which he received the inward and spiritual grace (are not these words plain?<a name=209:5></a>) of a death unto sin, and a new birth unto righteousness; and this, anomalous and inconsistent as it is, is clearly the doctrine of the framers of these services and this system; for the strict sense and definition of a sacrament is declared in the homilies to be, that the forgiveness of sins is annexed and tied to the visible sign.<a name=209:6></a> It is there said that absolution is not a sacrament, because though there is forgiveness of sins, there is no visible sign instituted by Christ; ordination is not, because though there is a visible sign, there is no forgiveness of sins; and that there are only properly two sacraments, because there are only two where the forgiveness of sins is annexed and tied to the visible sign.<a name=209:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let me call to your memory that I am not adducing these statements to prove the faults of the liturgy, but the principle on which the Establishment incorporates the whole population into Christian membership, believing or unbelieving, affirming them to be regenerate by the ordinance, and then making the belief of certain articles incumbent on them on another's promise.<a name=209:8></a>

		Next, the child is to be brought to be confirmed so soon as it can say the Creed, the Lord's Prayer, and the Ten Commandments, in the vulgar tongue, and is able to answer the Catechism set forth for that purpose.<a name=209:9></a> That Catechism sets forth and has taught him that he is a child of God by baptism already, and acknowledges he is bound to believe and to do as has been promised for him -- articles which, though of course containing facts of Christianity, tell him nothing really of the way of a sinner's salvation at all, for even in the interpretation he is taught that all mankind are redeemed, and clearly they are not

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would remark, in passing, that the instruction as to what he learns in the articles of his belief is objectionable even as articles, because creation is ascribed to the Father only as His act; and then redemption to God the Son, as if He had no part in creation, but had only a distinct act of redemption as His.<a name=210:2></a> But this by the bye.<a name=210:3></a> The instructions as to duty I have nothing to remark on, save that the knowledge of the Father, as His child should know, is nowhere found in the Catechism.<a name=210:4></a> In a word, what is properly Christian faith is found in it nowhere, though many topics of Christian truth are referred to.<a name=210:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The sacraments I have already spoken of, save to note that it is stated that the promises of God are made to them in the sacraments, and whatever articles may be given credence to, promises in a sacrament are the only personal resting-place which is proposed to the child: he is to believe in promises made in that sacrament.<a name=210:6></a> This preparation being made, he is to be brought to the bishop, he having there asserted that he is bound to believe, and that he will keep the commandments.<a name=210:7></a> It is repeated that they had been regenerated with the Holy Ghost, and been given the forgiveness of all their sins; and thus after Confirmation they are introduced to the Communion, being now in full membership (and why not, if they are regenerate of the Holy Ghost?<a name=210:8></a>) and now confirmed.<a name=210:9></a> And all her members are called upon by the Establishment as Christians, as Mr.<a name=210:10></a> M'Neil justly agrees, to partake of the Lord's supper -- the very people to whom the same person would preach, I believe very faithfully, as sinners to repent and turn to God, and to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, that they might be saved.<a name=210:11></a>

		Thus we have evidence as to the body, how the population -- the parishioners -- are fictitiously made the Church; and while individuals may preach the gospel, the body rests on a system of ordinances which makes the whole body, the whole population, by a fiction preserved to their burial, a body of regenerate Christians.<a name=210:12></a> If these services be compared with the system of popery, and the order of their administration, then not a

		moment's hesitation can be entertained of what (though doubtless purged of many details) the meaning and principles of them are.<a name=211:1></a> Of the fact that the body of communicants are not really Christians, no question is or can honestly be maintained: but the principle of the Establishment being that all parishioners should come, and orderly provision by her previous services being made that they should, it becomes not wrong that they should be there, but their positive fault and sin that they are not -- they are bound to come, believers or not; and thus is the principle of the Church of God laid prostrate altogether.<a name=211:2></a> And Mr.<a name=211:3></a> M'Neil presses it as the first act of obedience, should there have been previous disobedience all the week; and the rule of the Establishment would apply to an infidel who was not a notorious evil liver, and the fiction be kept up by his presence being taken as profession.<a name=211:4></a> This then is the principle of the Establishment as to the body; the effect is to scatter the saints of God, grieve and gall their consciences, and then reproach them with dissent and schism.<a name=211:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am now to refer to the documents, upon which I would only remark as to the former point that all the daily services go on the same principle of all the parishioners being good Christian people.<a name=211:6></a> It is vain to allege that a service is to be made, and must be for Christian people.<a name=211:7></a> The fact of the Establishment is, that they have made the Christian people for the service, which is a matter generally left out of sight in their plea for this.<a name=211:8></a> Who warranted them in doing this?<a name=211:9></a> or what does such a making amount to?<a name=211:10></a> A reference to the Homilies and Canons will abundantly confirm the statement that this is the principle of the Establishment.<a name=211:11></a> But to apply myself to the documents as to the ministry, we have seen, as I said, the facts (these are notorious) that the Crown and secular persons and bodies present to livings and bishoprics, and that young men are brought up to them as to a lucrative profession, and that they are bought for that purpose.<a name=211:12></a> And you cannot shew a single document by which these things can be shewn to be an abuse: they are strictly legal by the system of the Establishment.<a name=211:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I may be referred to the Ordination Service, where the person says he is called by the Holy Spirit.<a name=212:11></a> Be it so: but there are articles, on the one hand, to hinder anyone from acting on that, unless he has man's sanction and authority for doing it; and, on the other, if it be quite false, and the man a pretender, or careless, or a hypocrite, there are articles to maintain his authority, as of equal validity by Christ's commission, as if he really were; otherwise it would be clearly impossible to regard him as the minister of the parish, which by law they must, and treat those as dissenters and schismatics who have been perhaps called by the Holy Ghost, but have not submitted to avow their receiving the Holy Ghost from a bishop, whom the king or his minister has appointed.<a name=212:12></a> Do you believe every bishop the king appoints has power to confer the Holy Ghost?<a name=212:13></a> If not, surely it is an awful thing to pretend to receive it at his hands.<a name=212:14></a> We are told, first, the bishops are securities against any not really ministers intruding, and that we are liable to this

		evil; and then, where the fact is notorious that the vast body are not ministers, and are absolutely opposed to the gospel are not called by the Holy Ghost but enter it as a profession, we are told that, they having avowed they are led by the Holy Ghost through their own hypocrisy and fault, the Church has done all she can.<a name=213:1></a> Well, then, the plea of this security is folly -- save, observe, to authenticate as ministers, and the only lawful ministers, of the place those who are not ministers at all.<a name=213:2></a> This is all it does.<a name=213:3></a> The call of the Holy Ghost does in itself necessarily remain in the bosom of him who asserts it, but by his ordination the man is authenticated before the truth of his calling by the Holy Ghost is proved.<a name=213:4></a>

		I have now, I believe, dear sir, gone through what the documents of the Establishment present, and her legal authorized proceedings, which do not appear upon the face of her documents, but which are just her form and constitution as an Establishment, in order to judge as to my continuance within her pale as recognizing her as the Church of God.<a name=213:5></a> If you avow she is not the Church of God, then I feel no claim upon my soul on her part at all; but your assertion of schism or dissent in not being of her assumes a very important character indeed, because it pretends that she is.<a name=213:6></a> The framers of her canons and constitutions (who took, if unfounded, very clear and decided ground as to this) were well aware of this, and therefore honestly denounced and excommunicated all who questioned or impugned it.<a name=213:7></a> And this is the point you must meet, if you mean to hold the consciences of God's children.<a name=213:8></a> That party feeling, early habits, and natural associations, and in many cases personal attachment, may hold a multitude within her pale, I do not question.<a name=213:9></a>

To a person who has learnt to think with scripture "receiving the State into the Church" presents no conceivable idea. Put the assembly of believers, or "the assembly of God," in place of "the Church," and what is the meaning of receiving the State into the assembly of God"? God may add such as should be saved; three thousand souls may be added to the church; false brethren may creep in -- in a word, men or souls may be received in, but how the State can be received in it is impossible to conceive. And what is the interference naturally allowed to the State, when the Holy Ghost can alone really govern and act in the power of God? It is easy to talk of ecclesiastical arrangements, and "naturally allowed," when the title of Christ and the power of the Holy Ghost are forgotten; but that the State should interfere in the work of the Holy Ghost is very unnatural to those who are accustomed to look at the Church as the Church of God, where all that is real is of the Holy Ghost.

		<a class="footnote" name="#236:f2"><sup>++</sup></a>None of these passages traces spiritual life to baptism. They speak of the position in which believers were placed by baptism as their formal entrance into Christianity by a public confession, but none attributes life to baptism as its source: "Of his own will begat he us by the word of truth." It would be singular, if it were the case, that the apostle should thank God that he baptized none, God having sent him not to baptize (not therefore that life might be received) but to preach the gospel, the reception of which in the heart, it appears, by the quickening power of the Holy Ghost, does not communicate life, though it be the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth. "He that hath the Son hath life." It may be true that he who refuses to confess the Son in baptism, is not to be counted as having life; but to speak of baptism as the source of life would be quite a sufficient error to oblige the rejection of the Established system, as in its root papist and heretical; it is an essential and vital point. It is a source of life too, hypothetical on the secret of election it appears, without any action on the conscience, or testimony of the word of God. Hence also every case of conversion or regeneration of adults in these countries, at least in the pale of the Establishment, is absolutely false. Such a thing cannot exist, for being proved elect by their fruits and the seal of the Holy Ghost it is evident, according to the writer, that they have been regenerated at their baptism. All his preaching of the truth, that souls may be begotten to God by the word, is false from beginning to end, for all the elect who are there have been already regenerated in their baptism. Would he tell them so -- the drunkards, fornicators, avaricious -- that, if elect, they have been regenerated already really at their baptism, and of course cannot be so again? they have only to mend their ways? Where faith comes in it is hard to tell; but these regenerate persons are as to their hearts unbelievers, and perhaps oppose the truth of God strongly. But to what a labyrinth does error introduce us. Or would he say that these unhappy sinners, or the self-righteous, who are really just as bad, can never be regenerate, and cannot be among the elect? Alas, alas, where does systematic error lead him to whom the system is truth!

To apply figuratively -- and in the part of the passage quoted it is avowedly a figure -- the name of the thing signified to the sign is altogether another thing from affirming its efficacy in the individual who partakes of it. This latter is what the writer attempts to justify as to his use of the passage he here quotes for it, having omitted, as we have seen, the part relating to baptism. The Article of the Church of England itself will be a complete refutation; it takes pains to make the distinction Mr. Kelly would do away. Article 28 is entitled, "Of the wicked who eat not the body of Christ in the use of the Lord's supper." Although they carnally press the Sacrament with their teeth, yet in nowise are they partakers of Christ. The writer's view is merely the ex opere operato doctrine of the Papists applied to the elect -- not a tittle else. The passage in the Corinthians is to shew that men may partake of sacraments and not of life. Mr. Kelly uses it to shew that we may rightly affirm life of all those who partake of the sacraments. It is a singular perversion of the passage to the exact opposite of its intention.

But the Saviour gave Himself to gather into one the children of God which are scattered abroad, or dispersed through the world. The Lord does not speak there of gathering into one in heaven, for no question could be as to that; He speaks of an economy distinct from the nation. He gave Himself for the nation, and to gather the children of God into one. "There is one Spirit, and one body," which applies to this world, because the Apostle speaks of what the joints supply for the increase of the body, as elsewhere of the members suffering with each other. Also the passage in John is in contrast with the unity in glory; the Saviour prays that those that believe through their word may be one, that the world may believe, and then adds, "The glory which thou hast given me I have given them, that they may be made perfect in one, that the world may know."

In the national system young men are educated for the ministry, and afterwards called upon, when their life has received this direction as a profession, to declare that they are called of God. I find it hard to call this a reasonable precaution, if I believe the Holy Ghost to be the only real source of ministry. Besides, reasonable precautions are a very precarious ground, when our point is to follow the word of God. There is no precaution like obedience. All that this sentence means is, that when man has arranged things according to his own wisdom, then he will expect God to bless. That which is condemned by the writer puts God's blessing and will first, and looks to that as the source of comfort and edification. The fact is, that every one who wills enters on what is called the ministry of the Establishment, if he has a decent education in a college, and a decent character, or three persons to say he has; whereas what is condemned admits no ministry but that which flows from the gift, and presence, and power of the Holy Ghost.

	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#241:f3"><sup>+++</sup></a>It was not to such an officer that this task is allotted in the word of God. Next I deny that Titus was any constituted officer in the Church, or other than a temporary delegate of the apostle. Acts 20 proves that all application of the title of diocesan episcopacy to Timothy is utterly false, for the apostle puts the elders on their own responsibility, without the smallest reference, and to the exclusion of any such officer. Such delegate of apostolic authority does not exist, because the apostle is not here to delegate him, whatever the various measure of gift may be. Episcopal pretension to it is to be avoided for a very simple reason, that the power does not exist; and the kingdom of God is in power. If those who are called bishops in the Establishment, or in popery, examine the qualifications and source of mission of Timothy and Titus as given by the apostles, a very small share of modesty, not to say of truth, would make them resign all pretensions to being in the same position. Their service after all was very different in its character, but in both instances temporary. Do the archbishops or bishops seriously pretend to confer the Holy Ghost on men marked out by prophecy, when a bishop named by the prime minister is consecrated? It is serious trifling with these subjects -- a grave thing to pretend to give, or to have received, the Holy Ghost, and above all to take one's place in the Church of God as doing so. I tremble in thinking of the responsibility and the facts: the Lord keep me from judging.

		REVIEW OF A SERMON PREACHED BY THE REVEREND G. M. INNES, IN THE QUEBEC CATHEDRAL, ON SUNDAY, APRIL 5TH, 1868, AND PUBLISHED IN THE QUEBEC MERCURY, APRIL 9TH
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Dear Mr.<a name=243:1></a> Innes, <p>Had you confined your sermon to the church in which it was preached, I should never have taken any notice of it.<a name=243:2></a> You were within the sphere of your own labours.<a name=243:3></a> If you thought we were an evil people, you were right to warn your congregation against us.<a name=243:4></a> At any rate, I have no thought of answering the thousand-and-one attacks which are made upon us.<a name=243:5></a> The best way is to work on and take no notice of them.<a name=243:6></a> If we are according to God in our doctrine and walk, the Lord will answer for us; if not, it is well we should be judged.<a name=243:7></a> I am convinced that, though failing, as every Christian will own he does, in carrying his convictions out, and admitting that all who advocate the truth are not wise in their way of advocating it, I am convinced, I say, we are right in principle and practice; that our position is the only true scriptural one; but that it should be spoken against can neither surprise nor much distress me.<a name=243:8></a> It has been the fate of the most undoubted truth ever since truth was published.<a name=243:9></a> I have not even read the attacks in the <i>Record</i> and <i>Echo</i>; I never see them unless someone sends me some special numbers, and I go on my way and work quietly.<a name=243:10></a> But you have put your sermon in a common political journal, and made it public property, not a pastoral address.<a name=243:11></a> This paper has been sent me from Quebec; and some statements in it lead me to take notice of it, because truths important to all Christians are canvassed in it; and it does not merely consist of attacks on "Brethren," which I should have left unnoticed.<a name=243:12></a> I believe you to be a servant of God.<a name=243:13></a> I trust not a trace of unkind feeling is in my heart, I am not conscious of any; but as the truth of Christ is in question, I shall speak plainly.<a name=243:14></a> I cannot but think you have been misled by the flattering demand of hearers in thus bringing

		The controversy arose out of a statement of Mr.<a name=251:3></a> Molyneux, a clergyman, in Exeter Hall, that if a man was cleansed from his sin in the blood of Christ, and sanctified by the Spirit of God, he cannot then go to heaven; and that there was written up over the gate of heaven, "Do this and live!<a name=251:4></a>" To this I demurred.<a name=251:5></a> I hold, then, righteousness imputed without works to be a vital truth: Christ's work being of course the sole ground of it.<a name=251:6></a> I do not hold that a Christian is under the law, and that his keeping it is the righteousness which entitles him to heaven, but that, he not having kept it, Christ has kept that law for him, and thus has given him the title.<a name=251:7></a> I hold that he is in Christ, risen and Himself as man glorified according to the whole value of His work, and accounted righteous (the true sense of righteousness being imputed), according to the price of that blessed work in God's sight, and withal as in Christ Himself Yet I have no quarrel with any Christian who holds this legal righteousness to be his title.<a name=251:8></a> All I think is, he is not clear on this subject, and deprives himself of a very blessed and glorious privilege in connection with a risen and glorified Saviour.<a name=251:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next point is the Lord's prayer.<a name=251:10></a> Here, too, I have no quarrel with any; I leave every one perfectly free to use or not to use it.<a name=251:11></a> No Christian, in his senses, but thinks whatsoever the Lord did or said was absolutely perfect in its place.<a name=251:12></a> The question is, what is the place He gave it?<a name=251:13></a> I add, further, I think the argument against its use drawn from asking forgiveness is weak.<a name=251:14></a> The forgiven state is the witness of our being that in which we have forgiveness, like all other proof of life.<a name=251:15></a> But, for all that, the demand of it is generally a proof that true forgiveness is not known; but this is a question of spiritual perception and judgment.<a name=251:16></a> But Mr.<a name=251:17></a> Innes is singularly unhappy in his way of insisting on it.<a name=251:18></a> He takes the Lord's prayer, in Luke, because it is said: "When ye pray, say!<a name=251:19></a>" But nobody says the Lord's prayer as it is in Luke, but as it is in Matthew.<a name=251:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I repeat, no Christian in his senses, doubts of the perfectness of the Lord's words; and in principle every desirable thing is summed up in this prayer.<a name=252:6></a> But there is a very important feature in the nature of this prayer which Mr.<a name=252:7></a> Innes has overlooked -- it is not, and could not then be, in Christ's name.<a name=252:8></a> The Lord's own statement is distinct on this point: "Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name.<a name=252:9></a>" Now that Christ has accomplished redemption and gone up on high, as the Saviour who has finished His work, our Great High Priest, the essential character of true prayer is that it is in Christ's name.<a name=252:10></a> The Lord's prayer, as decidedly, was not, because it was perfect.<a name=252:11></a>

It was evidently not intended to be used as an exact, and far less as an exclusive, form. It is not given in the same words by any two of the evangelists. As it was given before the New Testament Church was set up, so it is strictly adapted to the old rather than to the new economy. It contains no clause asking for blessings in the name of Christ, which the Saviour Himself afterwards solemnly enjoined as indispensable. After the resurrection and ascension of Christ, when the New Testament Church was set up, we read nothing more in the inspired history of this form. And it is not till several centuries after the apostolic age that we find this prayer statedly introduced into public worship. Accordingly it is remarkable, that Augustine in the fourth century expresses the decisive opinion 'that Christ intended this prayer as a model rather than a form; that he did not mean to teach his disciples what words they should use in prayer, but what things they should pray for.'" <p>Poor unhappy Augustine!

		The difference is plain in the case put.<a name=301:3></a> A father's authority is admitted.<a name=301:4></a> Now if it be a matter of conscience, Christ's authority or the confession of His name, of course this cannot stand in the way.<a name=301:5></a> I am bound to love Christ more than father or mother.<a name=301:6></a> But suppose I reject my father's authority for everything my private judgment differs in as to what is right, there is an end of all authority.<a name=301:7></a> There may be cases of anxious enquiry as to what my duty is, where spiritual judgment alone can come to a right judgment.<a name=301:8></a> This is the case in the whole Christian life.<a name=301:9></a> We must have our senses exercised to discern good and evil -- not be unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is, and such exercises are useful.<a name=301:10></a>

		But the confounding a judgment I form simply as to right with conscience is, in result, confounding will with obedience.<a name=301:11></a> True conscience is always obedience to God; but if I take what I see as sufficient, confusion of a deadly character soon comes in.<a name=301:12></a> Does one not submit to a father's authority unless he can bring, even in an important matter, a text of scripture for everything he desires?<a name=301:13></a> Is there no setting up of self and selfwill in such a principle?<a name=301:14></a>

		There is another question connected with it -- one assembly's act binding another.<a name=302:1></a> I do not admit, because scripture does not admit, independent assemblies.<a name=302:2></a> There is the body of Christ, and all Christians are members of it; and the Church of God in one place represents the whole and acts in its name.<a name=302:3></a> Hence, in 1 Corinthians, where the subject is treated of, all Christians are taken in with the assembly of Corinth as such; yet this last is treated as the body as such, and made locally responsible for maintaining the purity of the assembly; and the Lord Christ is looked at as there; and what was done was done <i>in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ</i>.<a name=302:4></a> This is wholly ignored when one speaks of six or seven clever, intelligent Christians and a number of ignorant ones.<a name=302:5></a> The Lord in the midst of an assembly is set aside.<a name=302:6></a> The flesh, it is said, often acts in an assembly.<a name=302:7></a> Why assume it does and forget it may in an individual?<a name=302:8></a>

		Again, why speak of obeying the Lord first, then the Church?<a name=302:9></a> But supposing the Lord is in the Church?<a name=302:10></a> It is merely setting up private judgment against the judgment of an assembly meeting in Christ's name with His promise (if they are not, I have nothing to say to them); it is simply saying, I count myself wiser than those who are.<a name=302:11></a> I reject entirely as unscriptural the saying, "First Christ, then the Church.<a name=302:12></a>" If Christ be not in the Church, I do not own it at all.<a name=302:13></a> It assumes that the Church has not Christ, making them two parties.<a name=302:14></a> I may reason with an assembly, because I am a member of Christ and hence of it -- if it is one, help it.<a name=302:15></a> But if I own it as an assembly of God, I cannot assume Christ is not there.<a name=302:16></a> It is simply denying it is an assembly of God.<a name=302:17></a> The thought is wanting of what an assembly of God is.<a name=302:18></a> This is not surprising; but it necessarily falsifies judgment on the point, which is not "if the word" -- but if <i>I see</i> not the word for it.<a name=302:19></a> It is justly trusting one's own judgment as against others and the assembly of God.<a name=302:20></a>

		I find for my own spirit that the Christian has to watch against being brought under the pressure of what is going on around, if he give heed to it, even as a part of the ways or judgments of God.<a name=308:1></a> We are called to heavenly things, to have our conversation in heaven, to be occupied with Christ, sanctified by the truth, in that He has sanctified Himself, that we may be sanctified by the truth.<a name=308:2></a> We have to be simple concerning evil, and wise concerning that which is good; a blessed and most admirable precept, such as Christianity alone can bring about.<a name=308:3></a> We are warned that in the last days perilous times shall come.<a name=308:4></a> The terrible description of that state of things morally is given; but how simple the remedy when the perception of such a state exists!<a name=308:5></a> "From such turn away.<a name=308:6></a>" Turned away we are free to be occupied with Christ, and those heavenly things which sanctify us practically now and are our everlasting portion.<a name=308:7></a> No state of things can alter the word.<a name=308:8></a> We know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to purpose.<a name=308:9></a> We are purified to Christ to be a peculiar people -- a people appropriated to Himself.<a name=308:10></a> May we remember it!<a name=308:11></a> With this caution, which I find needed for myself as well as others, it is well to be aware (and the Spirit of God has made us aware) that there are perilous times, and this in the last days, in which we are.<a name=308:12></a>

		However unfeignedly one may rejoice in the prosperity of Christians, wherever they may be placed, as we clearly ought, and as I trust I do; however much we may desire the influence of Christian truth over the youths of a country, in contrast with the infidelity and popery now so influential and popular, and this is assuredly near my heart; yet in the volcanic heavings of the present day, when Christian bodies are so much mixed up with the world, and when, even among Christian professors, man and man's advancement are so displacing Christ, it is well to learn how to separate the precious from the vile, to learn what is the path in which the patient Christian should walk, and how far what is held out to us as good is good according to God.<a name=325:1></a>

		The paper I am now reviewing affords me an opportunity of examining principles whose activity I have seen displayed in other countries, and whose working it is of moment to inquire into, as very prevalent in the present day, and at the same time of investigating the claims of a system free from the grosser elements of ecclesiastical corruption, and hence not unfrequently affording a kind of asylum and resting-place for those whose consciences make it impossible for them to remain in what is in its fundamental principles popish, if not Roman, but who at the same time have not faith to walk on the water to meet Christ, if they cannot remain in the ship.<a name=325:2></a> It cannot be for a moment supposed that the working or success of the system I refer to in so distant a land can be an object of jealousy, or that there I can have any motive of attack, save as that system embodies principles which have their importance everywhere, and in these days especially come home to every conscience.<a name=325:3></a> It is as able a presentation of the system, in a brief compass, as I am acquainted with, and presents Presbyterianism in its fairest colours, and says as much for it as can well be said.<a name=325:4></a> As a general maintenance of the gospel and protestant truth against allied popery and infidelity, the system may have its value; and I can wish it success as a providential instrument.<a name=325:5></a> I believe that in the colonies Presbyterianism is the body which makes some counterpoise to Romanism and its infidel power and allies.<a name=325:6></a> The Episcopal body, having its distinctive importance from an ecclesiastical constitution analogous to Romanism, and not from truth of doctrine, forms

		none; or allies itself with only the popish influence, though for its own objects.<a name=326:1></a> I should therefore not write in the spirit of attack; but I shall discuss freely the pretensions and principles of the system advocated in the Moderator's speech to the General Assembly of New South Wales.<a name=326:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are some general principles more important to me than the ecclesiastical ones, which are taken for granted in the speech, but which I cannot pass over, as they are the key to a large movement among Christian men now, and involve most serious questions, trying to the heart even when they are clearly resolved to spiritual understanding and conscience by scripture.<a name=326:3></a> To a very great extent these have no more to do with Presbyterianism than with other denominations.<a name=326:4></a> They involve the mixture of the Church and the world.<a name=326:5></a> The true character of Christianity is in question in them.<a name=326:6></a> I am not here to call in question any needed improvement or culture when the will of God has placed us in the path of such culture.<a name=326:7></a> If it be an end, it is evil, it is not Christ.<a name=326:8></a> If it be a means of doing God's will, it may be a dangerous path, and is so; but it has its place, and if it be to be done, it should, as everything else, be done well; not in the case of a Christian, I repeat, as an object: Christ only can be rightly that -- the one motive for everything; but, as in everything we do according to His will, and to serve Him, we should do it diligently and well, heartily as unto the Lord.<a name=326:9></a> Thank God, we can!<a name=326:10></a> All these things are apt to become objects: faith looks beyond them and uses them as means when called for.<a name=326:11></a> A man in labouring for his children may work beautifully; but that is a different thing from having beautiful work artistically as his object.<a name=326:12></a> The question here is, Are we called by a heavenly calling, as a new creation belonging to heaven, though obliged to be pilgrims for awhile on earth?<a name=326:13></a> Are death and resurrection the basis of Christian life, or the improvement of the old man as an object in and of this world, because we are still of it?<a name=326:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The discourse of the Moderator does not take up the improvement of natural talents for needed service in this pilgrimage, but connects it with the Church -- makes it (as is so largely done in these days, more especially in new countries) a part of Christian life.<a name=326:15></a> Progress in the world, intellectual advancement, is a part, a large part, of Christian acting.<a name=326:16></a> The spirit of the age is to characterize Christianity, if Christ even lie as a germ at the bottom.<a name=326:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		My Dear Sir, <p>I consulted my brethren on the propriety of granting your request; they were strongly and unanimously opposed.<a name=350:1></a> I may say I cordially agreed with them.<a name=350:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The church is not ours, but the Lord's, and we would be glad to give it to any who were doing His work; but we believe you, and those of your mind, are endeavouring (not knowingly) to overturn divine institutions; we, therefore, cannot say God speed.<a name=350:3></a> The sabbath is a divine institution -- a relic of paradise -- a type of heaven -- a day that God commands us to keep holy -- no business, pleasure, or recreation -- a day that God's people have delighted in.<a name=350:4></a> Prophets and apostles have but one voice with regard to it "I love the Lord's day" a day that God has preserved as a standing miracle for religion, and honoured it above all days -- Pentecost, John in the isle of Patmos, etc.<a name=350:5></a> We believe that no sin does God oftener visit with His manifest displeasure so much as the violation of the sabbath.<a name=350:6></a> Therefore, with those who would take away this day, or bring it down to a level with other days, we can hold no fellowship -- we must look upon them as enemies of God and of righteousness.<a name=350:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, as to the law, we hold it to be the will of God that it cannot change, nor can our obligation to keep it ever cease.<a name=350:8></a> There is infinitely greater obligation upon us to obey the law than was upon Adam; and while the unregenerate hate the law, we believe God's people love it.<a name=350:9></a> "Oh!<a name=350:10></a> how I love thy law.<a name=350:11></a>" The law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good: we can give no sympathy to those who magnify one attribute of God, at the expense of another.<a name=350:12></a> We love the justice and righteousness, as well as the mercy, of God; and we believe that His law will be the rule of life in heaven as well as earth.<a name=350:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, as to the ministry, we hold it a divine appointment for the edifying of the body of Christ; and, therefore, any who intrude themselves into this office, or undertake the duties without being called to it, and set apart, as was Aaron, and in gospel times as Timothy (1 Timothy 4: 4), and, therefore, also enter by another way, and take the office, and perform the duties -- the same is a thief and a robber.<a name=350:14></a> Your views also of

		the truth on the points in question, as taught in the New Testament; and that the difference affects man's state, the nature of the gospel, the effect of Christ's death and resurrection, not as to fundamental orthodoxy, but as to its application to man.<a name=352:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am sure Mr.<a name=352:2></a> A.<a name=352:3></a> is quite unaware of it, but his view upsets man's total ruin, and the ground of a sinner's standing.<a name=352:4></a> Nor do I think he knows "what he says or whereof he affirms," while "desiring to be a teacher of the law.<a name=352:5></a>" For it is most certain that man under law, converted or unconverted, regenerate or not, is lost, unless Christ be a mere maker-up of deficiency -- a doctrine, I am persuaded, Mr.<a name=352:6></a> A.<a name=352:7></a> would repudiate.<a name=352:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		For the law must press a man for what he is himself, if he be under it.<a name=352:9></a> "As many as are of the works of the law are under the curse" -- not as many as have violated, but as many as are on that principle.<a name=352:10></a> (I am sure in Mr.<a name=352:11></a> A.<a name=352:12></a> it is merely ignorance.<a name=352:13></a>) They that be of faith are blessed -- this is not blessing in keeping the law, and curse in violating it.<a name=352:14></a> Were it so, all would be infallibly under the curse, for man is a sinner; the regenerate man, the flesh being in him, fails; if he is under the law, he is under the curse.<a name=352:15></a> No doubt, the law is abstractedly good; but man is a sinner in nature before he gets it, and is necessarily and wholly lost under it.<a name=352:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In vain he says he is regenerate; the law knows no such distinction; it asks, Are you such as I require?<a name=352:17></a> No, I am not, says the regenerate man (who indeed alone truly says so).<a name=352:18></a> Then, says the law, I curse you.<a name=352:19></a> But you say, I am not under you for justification, but as a rule.<a name=352:20></a> But, I curse you, says the law, because you have not kept the rule; and it will not and cannot do anything else.<a name=352:21></a> It is in vain to say we do not put man under it for justification.<a name=352:22></a> It puts him under itself for condemnation, if he has anything to say to it.<a name=352:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I quite admit that the law is the rule (not of life, indeed, so as to obtain it, but) of existence and joy in heaven; and that it would be on earth (taken in its highest character in the commandments the Lord extracts from the Old Testament, as that on which law and prophets hang), if man were not a sinner; but then his redemption would not be necessary.<a name=352:24></a> But he is a sinner; and hence, under law, he is under curse.<a name=352:25></a> It cannot be a rule of life to a sinner, because it is a rule of death; not because it is not holy, just, and good, but because

		it is, and man is a sinner.<a name=353:1></a> Viewed in his new nature, I do not doubt man fulfils the law as a new creature; for love is the fulfilling of the law; but this does not put him under it.<a name=353:2></a> The reasoning of the apostle is that you need not put him under it; for he alone who was not under it in spirit kept it; that, as an administered code, it was the strength of sin -- entered when man was already a sinner, that the offence might abound; that sin, taking occasion by it, wrought all manner of concupiscence, and rendered sin excessively sinful; in fine, that we could not have two husbands at a time, nor seek blessing on two principles; that we are not under law, but under grace; and if led by the Spirit, we are not under law, Christ having delivered us from it, being dead to the law by the body of Christ.<a name=353:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In a word, the scripture testifies, that put a man under the law, and he is (sinner or saint) a cursed, dead, condemned creature; that it is a ministration of death, and a ministration of condemnation.<a name=353:4></a> Mr.<a name=353:5></a> A.<a name=353:6></a> has not kept it; if he is under it, he is lost; it knows no mercy, and God's holiness can allow no mitigation of its terms.<a name=353:7></a> I cannot have the two husbands: dead to the one, we are married to another -- even to Christ risen.<a name=353:8></a> In His death, which infinitely magnified it, as in life He honoured it, I am dead to it -- risen, He is not under it, though as a new life He fulfils its principles in me, by having taken me from under it by redemption.<a name=353:9></a> He who says, I am under law, in principle denies the redemption of Christ.<a name=353:10></a> Fulfilling it, without being under it, yea, by not being under it.<a name=353:11></a> Scripture speaks of the Christian being under it never.<a name=353:12></a> In a word, the Christian, viewed as a new creature, accomplishes the law, for he loves and does no ill to his neighbour; but he is not placed under it (for if he were, he would be condemned by it); he sees that Christ alive on earth was, and in death bore its curse, and in the power of redemption delivered us from it; while He communicates a nature to us as risen, which delights in it and does it, but does not put the believer under it.<a name=353:13></a>

		Finally, as regards ministry, fewer words will suffice.<a name=355:7></a> I believe ministry to be an institution of God, and distinctively so, grace looking for spiritual testimony, whether evangelical to the world, or in edification to the church; as a people in covenant under the law, and unable directly to approach God needed a priesthood -- two points which Mr.<a name=355:8></a> A.<a name=355:9></a> confounds, as he did the two systems on the other two heads.<a name=355:10></a> But it is the ministry and manifestation of the Spirit; but if he holds that it depends upon man's appointment and man's call, he upsets the whole testimony of the New Testament, the point of which is, that a man traffics with his talents given, because he trusts his Master.<a name=355:11></a> But if Mr.<a name=355:12></a> A.<a name=355:13></a> makes the Presbyterian system the call of God, he will find only sectarian support.<a name=355:14></a> If he admits other calls too, then neither is scriptural; and the only point insisted on is, that man should meddle in it; and in reality it becomes geography, and, for the most part, academical provision for unconverted men taking care of unconverted flocks.<a name=355:15></a> If he calls this the scriptural call of God, it is bold dealing with holy things.<a name=355:16></a> If he insists on 1 Timothy 4: 14, to what pastoral care was Timothy ordained?<a name=355:17></a> If any thing, he was a diocesan bishop.<a name=355:18></a> But he was not this, but as the spiritual right hand of the apostle, as Titus was in Crete.<a name=355:19></a> I admit the call of God -- the necessity of the call of God -- to the various services of the ministry, whatever it may be.<a name=355:20></a> That man should sanction it, or make academies or geography out of it, or pastors over a mass of unconverted people in a geographical district, or unconverted pastors over Christ's sheep, no one will be able to shew me from scripture; and to scripture I must be excused for adhering.<a name=355:21></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The attempt would be absurd.<a name=356:1></a> Every one the least conversant with scripture must know that the ministry of the word was exercised by every class of persons, without any warrant but the call of God and the love of Christ constraining them; and that apostles had not a thought of calling it in question, nor dreamed of ecclesiastical sanction being requisite for its exercise -- and this at all times from the commencement of Christian ministry to the end.<a name=356:2></a> John does not say, as to evil teachers, Let them shew their ordination, nor Paul as to those who preached of contention, nor call in question those who waxed bold through his bonds, nor those who were scattered abroad after Stephen's persecution, with whom the hand of the Lord was.<a name=356:3></a> Within the church it is notorious, that, as every one received the gift, he was to minister it as a good steward.<a name=356:4></a> One had a psalm, another an interpretation, another a doctrine; and the only check was, Let all be done decently and in order -- all to edification, the manifestation of the Spirit being given for profit; and hence more than two or three were not to speak at a meeting.<a name=356:5></a> In these things the discipline of the church of God would come in according to scripture, as is evident in case of teaching error.<a name=356:6></a> The clerical system is the denial of God's title in the ministry.<a name=356:7></a> In the reformed church abroad this is now generally admitted by those sound in the faith, and even strongly written against by well-known evangelical ministers of the Establishment.<a name=356:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The point of the sacraments, so called, only remains.<a name=356:9></a> Mr.<a name=356:10></a> A.<a name=356:11></a>'s statements are on the same wretched legal ground -- man makes a covenant with God in them.<a name=356:12></a> I reply, If he does, he is lost, for he will certainly fail, and there can be no consequence of failure (for it is sin) but condemnation; for man's entering into a covenant is not grace -- the grace of God.<a name=356:13></a> I account baptism and the Lord's supper to be precious institutions of the Lord Jesus: one as admitting publicly in the church on the principle of the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ; the other, spiritual fellowship of His death in the unity of the body, as sitting by grace in heavenly places.<a name=356:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But talking of making a covenant with God is merely total ignorance of the whole place we are in.<a name=356:15></a> I was not aware these poor brethren were so very far removed in their minds from the true Christian place in which the grace, the blessed grace, of God has set us.<a name=356:16></a> Does Mr.<a name=356:17></a> A.<a name=356:18></a> really think he has to begin

		WHAT IS A SECT?
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The word "sect" is employed in the English translation to express the Greek word "hairesis.<a name=362:1></a>" The meaning of this word is well known.<a name=362:2></a> It is used (except in the Acts of the Apostles, where it is found six times) only once in the Epistle to the Corinthians, once in the Epistle to the Galatians (chapter 1: 20), and once in that of Peter (2 Peter 2).<a name=362:3></a> In the first epistle to the Corinthians alone is it translated by the word <i>heresy</i> (1 Corinthians 11: 19).<a name=362:4></a> It signifies a doctrine, or a system, whether of philosophy or religion, which has its adherents united as adopting this doctrine.<a name=362:5></a> Its meaning is a little modified now, because the professing church (at least the greater part of it) has taken the name of Catholic, that is to say, universal.<a name=362:6></a> Then every religious body, every Christian gathering, which does not belong to this community (so-called Catholic), is by it called a sect; from this the word is become a word of censure All the Christian bodies are sometimes called sects, in the sense of divisions, when they separate themselves from the whole complement of Christians, or from those who bear this name.<a name=362:7></a> However, the word sect implies in itself always more or less of censure, from the idea that those who compose it are reunited by a doctrine or a particular denomination.<a name=362:8></a> We cannot say that this way of looking at it is entirely false; the application may be false, but not the idea itself.<a name=362:9></a> But what is important is to discover that which, in fact, is an assembly of Christians justly deserving this name; or, since it is applied to assemblies or Christian corporations, it is necessary to understand the true principle on which we ought to assemble.<a name=362:10></a> That which is not based on this principle is really a sect.<a name=362:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Although the Catholics (so-called) have made a bad use of this truth, it is not less true that the unity of the Church is a truth of the greatest importance for Christians, whether the unity of all individually manifested in the world (John 17), or that of the body of Christ, formed by the Holy Ghost come down here (Acts 2; 1 Corinthians 12: 13).<a name=362:12></a> So in John 17 the Lord asks the Father, with regard to those who shall believe through the word of the apostles, "that they all may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me," John 17: 21.<a name=362:13></a> We see there the practical unity of Christians in the

	<div class="paragraph">
		communion of the Father and the Son.<a name=363:1></a> The apostles should be <i>one</i> in thought, word, and deed, by the operation of one Spirit, as the Father and the Son in the unity of the divine nature (verse 11).<a name=363:2></a> Then those who should believe by their word ought to be <i>one</i> in the communion of the Father and the Son (verse 21).<a name=363:3></a> We shall be perfect in the unity of the glory (verse 22); but we ought to be <i>one</i> now, in order that the world may believe (verse 21).<a name=363:4></a> Further, the Holy Ghost came down from heaven on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2), baptized all believers of that time into one body, united to Christ as a body to the head, and manifested here below on the earth in this unity (1 Corinthians 12: 13).<a name=363:5></a> We see clearly that it is on the earth, where it says, in the twelfth chapter of the first epistle to the Corinthians, "If one member suffer, all the members suffer; and if one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.<a name=363:6></a>" We do not suffer in heaven.<a name=363:7></a> But then it is added, "Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.<a name=363:8></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The whole chapter shews the same truth; but these verses suffice to demonstrate that it treats of the Church on the earth.<a name=363:9></a> See here, then, the true unity formed by the Holy Ghost: first, the unity of brethren between themselves; and, secondly, the unity of the body.<a name=363:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The spirit of a sect exists when we see disciples unite outside this unity, and when it is around an opinion that those who profess it are gathered, in order that they be united by means of this opinion.<a name=363:11></a> The unity is not founded on the principle of the unity of the body, nor of the union of brethren.<a name=363:12></a> When such persons are united in a corporation, and mutually recognize each other as members of this corporation, then they constitute formally a sect, because the principle of the gathering is not the unity of the body; and the members are united, not as members of the body of Christ, when they are even such, but as members of a particular corporation.<a name=363:13></a> All Christians are members of the body of Christ -- an eye, a hand, a foot, etc.<a name=363:14></a> (1 Corinthians 12: 13-25).<a name=363:15></a> The idea of being a member of a church is not found in the word.<a name=363:16></a> The Holy Ghost compares the Church on the earth to a body, of which Christ is the Head (Ephesians 1: 22, 23; Colossians 1: 18); then each Christian is a member of this body, so of Christ.<a name=363:17></a> But to be a member of a particular corporation is quite another idea.<a name=363:18></a> Now, the supper of the Lord being the expression of this union of the members (as says 1 Corinthians 10: 17), when a corporation of Christians recognizes

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		its right to receive its members to it, there is a unity formally opposed to the unity of the body of Christ.<a name=364:1></a> It is possible that this may be ignorance, or that these Christians have never apprehended what is the unity of the body, and that it is the will of God that this unity be manifested on the earth; but, in fact, they form a sect, a denial of the unity of the body of Christ.<a name=364:2></a> Several of those who are members of the body of Christ are not members of this corporation; and the Supper, although the members partake piously of it, is not the expression of the unity of the body of Christ.<a name=364:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But now a difficulty is presented: the children of God are dispersed; many pious brethren are attached to this opinion, to that corporation, and mixed up for advantage' sake, even in religious things, with the world.<a name=364:4></a> There are alas!<a name=364:5></a> many who have no idea of the unity of the body of Christ, or who deny the duty of manifesting this unity on earth.<a name=364:6></a> But all that does not annihilate the truth of God.<a name=364:7></a> Those who unite themselves, as I have already said, are but a sect in principle.<a name=364:8></a> If I recognize all Christians as members of the body of Christ, if I love them, and receive them, from an enlarged heart, even to the Supper, supposing that they are walking in holiness and truth, calling upon the name of the Lord out of a pure heart (2 Timothy 2: 19-22; Revelation 3: 7), then I am not walking in the spirit of a sect, even although I cannot gather together all the children of God, because I walk according to the principle of this unity of the body of Christ, and seek practical union amongst the brethren.<a name=364:9></a> If I join with other brethren to take the Lord's supper only as a member of the body of Christ, not as a member of a church, whichever it may be, but verily in the unity of the body, ready to receive all Christians who are walking in holiness and truth, I am not the member of a sect; I am a member of nothing else but of the body of Christ.<a name=364:10></a> But to gather together upon another principle, in whatever manner it may be, to make a religious corporation, is to make a sect.<a name=364:11></a> The principle is very simple.<a name=364:12></a> The practical difficulties are sometimes great by reason of the state of the Church of God; but Christ is sufficient for all; and if we are content to be little in the eyes of men, the thing is not so very difficult.<a name=364:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A sect, then, is a religious corporation united upon another principle than that of the body of Christ.<a name=364:14></a> It is formally such when those who compose this particular corporation are regarded as being the members of it.<a name=364:15></a> It is to walk in the

	<div class="paragraph">
		spirit of a sect when those alone are recognized in a practical manner, without giving themselves out as properly members of a corporation.<a name=365:1></a> We do not speak of the discipline which is exercised in the bosom of the unity of the body of Christ, but of the principle upon which we are gathered together.<a name=365:2></a> The word does not recognize any such thing as to be member of a church; it speaks always of the members of the body of Christ.<a name=365:3></a> But these are bound to manifest unity in walking together.<a name=365:4></a> We can cite Matthew 18: 20 as a precious encouragement in these times of dispersion, in these sad times of the last days, where the Lord promises His presence to two or three gathered together in His name.<a name=365:5></a> He gives us 2 Timothy 2: 22 to direct us in the path of His will, in the midst of the confusion which reigns around us.<a name=365:6></a>
