		LETTER ON THE DIVINE INSPIRATION OF THE HOLY SCRIPTURES OR REMARKS ON THE LETTER OF RESIGNATION OF M. LE PROFESSEUR EDMOND SCHERER
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		INTRODUCTION
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The letter of Mr.<a name=1:1></a> Scherer to Dr.<a name=1:2></a> M.<a name=1:3></a> d'Aubigne having been communicated to me by a third person who desired to have my opinion of it, I answered with all freedom, without meditating any future publicity.<a name=1:4></a> I spoke severely in several places, because I judged severely that which I criticized.<a name=1:5></a> The Christian's faith is something too precious not to oppose clearly that which ruins it.<a name=1:6></a> And one will find all the imperfections in this letter necessarily connected with a composition of this kind.<a name=1:7></a> Perhaps it ought to have been corrected before being given to the public, but it has not been.<a name=1:8></a> The end in view in printing was to communicate it to a few friends, who desired to read it, for want of time to make copies.<a name=1:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another word.<a name=1:10></a> The blame that rests on Mr.<a name=1:11></a> Scherer's letter cannot fail in a certain sense to reflect upon the author.<a name=1:12></a> But I desire ardently that the reader and Mr.<a name=1:13></a> S.<a name=1:14></a> himself, if this should fall into his hands, may distinguish as I have done myself as much as possible between Mr.<a name=1:15></a> S.<a name=1:16></a> and his letter.<a name=1:17></a> I doubt not that Mr.<a name=1:18></a> S.<a name=1:19></a>, spite of his grave errors, has excellent qualities, and I like to appreciate them impartially, judging his doctrine without thinking of himself.<a name=1:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When I say that I could distinguish between Mr.<a name=1:21></a> S.<a name=1:22></a> and his letter, I do not mean that he does not deserve blame, for it is clear he is responsible for what he has done.<a name=1:23></a> But this is what I mean: the flesh in a Christian is not better, alas!<a name=1:24></a> than in a man of the world, and I cherish the thought that Mr.<a name=1:25></a> S.<a name=1:26></a> is a Christian, whatever may be the gravity of his position; I hope that this circumstance may be a blessing to him.<a name=1:27></a> While judging his actions according to their merits for the love of souls, I hope that he himself will judge this "lust of the mind," as my answer does, and, separating himself from them, escape the condemnation they merit.<a name=1:28></a>

		If then I have said that to treat a subject so serious in such a light and superficial way is the act of a vulgar mind, I believe I have expressed a sound judgment upon the act of Mr.<a name=2:1></a> S.<a name=2:2></a>; but I sincerely desire that he may not feel hurt.<a name=2:3></a> But I do not desire the reader to esteem Mr.<a name=2:4></a> S.<a name=2:5></a> as a vulgar mind, but rather that he will join with me in hoping that after reflection, Mr.<a name=2:6></a> S.<a name=2:7></a> judging himself will shew that the words by which I condemn him apply to his acts and not to himself.<a name=2:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In order to treat the subject thoroughly it would need a volume and this is only a letter; you must not expect therefore more than a familiar and hastily-written letter can give.<a name=2:9></a>

		M -- -- -, <br>Thanks for having sent me Mr.<a name=2:11></a> Scherer's letter to Dr.<a name=2:12></a> Merle d'Aubigne.<a name=2:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have seen nothing worse than this letter.<a name=2:14></a> It is a sign of a vulgar spirit to speak so lightly, so superficially, and with so much vanity and self-confidence, on subjects so serious.<a name=2:15></a> In the background (for I see no reason to accuse him of it) I see a bad faith, which betrays the presence and action of an evil spirit, of a demon.<a name=2:16></a> For my part I cannot reduce the question to that of a degree of inspiration, literal or otherwise -- an interesting question for those who believe in a revelation.<a name=2:17></a> That which is contended for here is not at all a certain degree of inspiration (such an intention is denied), but all written revelation, and also all revelation made by the mouth of man.<a name=2:18></a> There are truths, but they are not a communication from God, unless they are communicated from the Person of Christ to the soul, if that even can be according to his principles.<a name=2:19></a> The letter denies the existence of all word from God, of whatever nature it be, except so far that Christ bears this title, for which, after all, from his system one has no authority.<a name=2:20></a> This might be a mistake of John's, or a rabbinical tradition, or rabbino-platonist; and indeed the expression is found in works of this character.<a name=2:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The question then which we have specially before us is, whether there exists a written revelation from God, which consequently bears His authority.<a name=2:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We shall not, therefore, at present discuss the character and degree of inspiration which we claim for the scriptures.<a name=2:23></a> We shall not enter upon the discussion of verbal inspiration, interesting as that question is to those who believe in a revelation from God.<a name=2:24></a> Neither is it our present object to defend the facts and doctrines of Christianity.<a name=2:25></a> These truths are not denied by some who deny their immediate communication to us by God.<a name=2:26></a> The existence of a written revelation from God, bearing His authority as His word, is that which we would now discuss.<a name=2:27></a> It is important to keep this clearly before us; for that which is denied is, that we have any communication of divine truth which possesses divine authority.<a name=2:28></a>
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now for us, according to the author of this letter, there is no inspiration from God, there is no divine truth; because a truth which is not communicated with divine certainty is not to us a divine truth.<a name=3:1></a> Or, to speak more accurately, an existing fact which cannot be naturally known to man, because not relating to this creation, cannot be a truth to my soul, if it be not communicated with divine certainty.<a name=3:2></a> In order to this, there might be an immediate revelation to each individual in each case; or there must be an inspired communication through others, either written or by the word of mouth.<a name=3:3></a> I speak not of truth previously revealed being applied to the conscience by the Holy Ghost, but of the way in which we arrive at the divine certainty of the truth by knowing that it came from God.<a name=3:4></a> A doctrine cannot have more authority as truth than the means employed for its communication.<a name=3:5></a> A man, without being inspired, may be the channel through which truth, already existing as a revelation from God, is imparted; and the truth, thus communicated, may act through the Spirit's power on the heart and conscience; for there is no basis for faith; but such an uninspired medium of communication -- a preacher, for instance, or a tract -- does not constitute a divine basis for faith in him who hears.<a name=3:6></a> That basis must exist beforehand in the fact of God having vouchsafed an inspired communication; and the effect now produced by God in the soul is, that the hearer is led to recognize this.<a name=3:7></a> Otherwise, though he may say, "I believe this or that," if I ask him, "Why do you believe it?<a name=3:8></a>" he has no answer; he can give no satisfactory reason for his faith.<a name=3:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us remember then, that when authority is spoken of, and it is said there is no authority in matters of faith, the words "divine certainty" may be substituted for authority; and that the doctrine now opposed is, that there is no divine certainty in the things of faith.<a name=3:10></a> That is, there is no warrant for faith at all.<a name=3:11></a> John the Baptist describes faith in these words -- "He that hath received his testimony hath set to [affixed] his seal that God is true.<a name=3:12></a> For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God.<a name=3:13></a>" But this reception of divine testimony has no existence in the system which denies inspiration.<a name=3:14></a> The testimony of God is excluded, and there is no place for faith.<a name=3:15></a> This may be called an <i>a priori</i> argument.<a name=3:16></a> But no!<a name=3:17></a> I only present the question in its true light; and this is often enough to convince a sincere person.<a name=3:18></a> For example; if any one disputed the interpretation of a text, and I could shew that his mode of looking at it -- the effect of his reasoning upon it -- was to make it appear that Christ was wicked, or to prove that He was not the Son of God; to state the real question would be, in fact, to decide it in the mind of one who knew Christ.<a name=3:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Besides, there are two kinds of <i>a priori</i> arguments, which it is important to distinguish; as they differ totally from each other, and are morally opposed to each other.<a name=4:1></a> Let us suppose that some one tried to prove God a liar.<a name=4:2></a> I answer, "That cannot be.<a name=4:3></a> A <i>priori</i>, I condemn your reasoning as false.<a name=4:4></a>" In that case my judgment is sound (perfectly logical and philosophical, if you like to take that ground), because it is much more sure, nay, it is infallibly sure, that God cannot lie; whilst it is very possible that your reasoning is false, even though I were unable to detect the fallacy.<a name=4:5></a> How many things there are as to which the judgment of a wayfaring man is right, although he may be wanting in the capacity for reasoning rightly!<a name=4:6></a> And this is the safeguard which God has given to the simple-minded, namely, a divine conviction as to the truth with respect to things which are beyond their reach -- beyond the reach of man; while the philosopher, who undertakes to explain them, sinks in the mire.<a name=4:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To say, "God ought not to be or to do so-and-so," is also what is called <i>a priori</i> reasoning; but it is of an entirely different kind.<a name=4:8></a> In the former case I measure the folly of man by the certainty of what God is; in the latter I measure what God ought to be or to do by the standard of human thought, which is necessarily false.<a name=4:9></a> "Thou thoughtest," said God, "that I was altogether such an one as thyself; but I will reprove thee, and set before thee things which thou hast done.<a name=4:10></a>" In the first case I say, "God is true; therefore your argument, which denies it, must be false.<a name=4:11></a>" In the second, I say, "This is my thought; and God must be, or must act, according to my thoughts.<a name=4:12></a>" To measure man by the certainty of what God is, and to measure God by man, are two very different things.<a name=4:13></a> The former may be termed <i>a priori</i> reasoning.<a name=4:14></a> It presumes, I allow, that there is the knowledge of God; and it is possible that Mr.<a name=4:15></a> Scherer does not admit the force of such reasoning; and all men have not this knowledge.<a name=4:16></a> "He hideth these things from the wise and prudent, and revealeth them unto babes.<a name=4:17></a>"
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I do not exaggerate in saying that this system takes away all divine certainty in things concerning faith, and, according to him, one ceases totally and absolutely to set to his seal that God is true.<a name=5:1></a> That is, as to the testimony, God is excluded: the author's words prove it.<a name=5:2></a> "Otherwise," says he, "why is an historical certainty coupled with a moral evidence not sufficient for the Christian in things concerning faith?<a name=5:3></a>" The object then is to substitute a purely human belief in place of a divine testimony, in fact, to exclude God.<a name=5:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are other striking examples of this want to exclude God in the letter.<a name=5:5></a> But to return to the subject: it is evident that, whatever may be the competency of witnesses, from their own faithfulness, and from the important fact of their knowledge of the circumstances which they relate, yet to deny direct inspiration, and to put in its stead the competency of witnesses, is to substitute merely human testimony for divine testimony.<a name=5:6></a> The aim of such a system is to exclude God.<a name=5:7></a> It asserts (for without this it would be open infidelity) that revelation is allowed, although not inspiration; that is, that the apostles, or others employed to communicate truth, had a divine basis for their faith, but that other believers have not: this is plainly the effect of the supposition.<a name=5:8></a> According to this system truth has been revealed from heaven, that is, has been divinely communicated to the apostles and others; but since that time there has been nothing to rest on but human testimony -- credible it may be, but only human.<a name=5:9></a> This system allows of no divine basis, which, on God's part,<a href="#5:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> could shield the church from error.<a name=5:10></a> Now the mere statement of this doctrine is almost its refutation; besides which it is formally contradicted in the word itself.<a name=5:11></a> "But God," says the apostle, who carefully states the opposite of the notion of Mr.<a name=5:12></a> Scherer, "hath revealed them unto us<a href="#5:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a> by his Spirit.<a name=5:13></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#5:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>On God's part, I say, because no one disputes the possibility of man's falling into error through his own folly or negligence.
	</div>
	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#5:f2"><sup>++</sup></a>What is true in this respect of one apostle, or sacred writer, is no doubt true of the rest. No one would venture to assert that the communications made through Paul were of a different character, or of another nature, from those given through Peter, or John, or any other prophet.

	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The reason which the apostle gives for this revelation is very striking.<a name=6:1></a> "For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him?<a name=6:2></a> even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.<a name=6:3></a> Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are given to us of God.<a name=6:4></a>" I was going to dwell upon this argument, forgetting that the apostle had used it; I will now only insist on the force of his statement: "Without a divine communication there can be no faith.<a name=6:5></a>" That which belongs to man -- that which is within the limits of his intelligence -- may be known through the senses, through reasoning, or through the testimony of man; but it is not so in the things of faith, as to divine thoughts and truths.<a name=6:6></a> God alone knows them, and God alone can make them known; consequently man must be entirely ignorant of them, unless God reveals them.<a name=6:7></a> But He makes them known by His Spirit, that is, by revelation; giving the Holy Ghost Himself, who reveals them to the mind.<a name=6:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I speak of the apostolic work.<a name=6:9></a> The question then stands within very narrow limits.<a name=6:10></a> It is this: the apostles having received the knowledge of these things in a divine manner, did they communicate them to us in a divine manner, or in a manner, excellent indeed, but not inspired?<a name=6:11></a> God had revealed them to the apostles by His Spirit; how did they communicate them?<a name=6:12></a> Was their inspiration what is termed "simply religious inspiration"?<a name=6:13></a> Was it only that operation of the Spirit which is found in a spiritual preacher, and which leaves him still liable to error?<a name=6:14></a> Nothing can be more precise than the testimony of the apostle on this point.<a name=6:15></a> Continuing the passage already quoted, he says, "which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth.<a name=6:16></a>" Could the idea of inspiration be embodied in a form of words more absolutely definite than the expression, "words which the Holy Ghost teacheth"?<a name=6:17></a> Here then there is nothing equivocal.<a name=6:18></a> When the apostle set forth the truths which the Holy Ghost had taught him, he used words which the Holy Ghost had also taught him.<a name=6:19></a> This unfortunate Mr.<a name=6:20></a> Scherer, betrayed by his vanity, can, with a revolting lightness (which, if one does not consider as such, is a blasphemy), call this a "cabalistic ventriloquy," but that which he designates thus is clear and certain.<a name=6:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=7>[Page 7]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And notice here, it is not said that it is not inspiration, but a cabalistic ventriloquy; that is, supposing inspiration to be true, that he designates thus, in contrast with the noble accents of human voice; that is, it was God Himself speaking through the mouth of man.<a name=7:1></a> This he designates with these insulting and blasphemous words.<a name=7:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the idea of reducing all inspiration to "religious inspiration," it is overturned by the fact, that inspiration is asserted in cases where "religious inspiration" was impossible, as in that of Balaam, when "he took up his parable," and spoke, having "heard the words of God.<a name=7:3></a>" Besides, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and many others of the scripture writers, who have said to us, "Thus saith the Lord"; "The word of the Lord came unto me, saying," etc.<a name=7:4></a>, are all properly so-called examples of positive inspiration.<a name=7:5></a> The reasonings of the author's letter apply to all.<a name=7:6></a> Still there is no equivoque here.<a name=7:7></a> The prophets boldly proclaim their inspiration, and we have the results of it in a written form.<a name=7:8></a> In regard to this I accuse the letter of a mean and evil faith.<a name=7:9></a> Be it remembered moreover, that the arguments which deny inspiration must, if applied at all, be applied universally.<a name=7:10></a> The Old and New Testaments stand or fall together.<a name=7:11></a> In examining this subject, the Old Testament cannot honestly be left out, because the arguments (except, perhaps, those which relate to the canon) apply to both -- to the Old as to the New; with the addition that the inspiration of the Old has the positive attestation of the Lord and the apostles, supposing only the authenticity and correctness of the New.<a name=7:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But has the Old Testament authority, and has the New Testament none?<a name=7:13></a> Is the Old Testament the word of God, and not the New?<a name=7:14></a> It may be very convenient to our opponents, in reasoning upon a subject, to leave out that part of which the proofs are incontestable.<a name=7:15></a> For if the Old Testament be inspired, inspiration is a reality, and we possess the absolute authority of God's own word.<a name=7:16></a> The prophets have affirmed it; the Lord has recognized it; that is, He has recognized the inspiration of the Old Testament as it stands; and He has declared that nothing can invalidate its authority.<a name=7:17></a> The apostle also has declared that these scriptures were "given by inspiration of God," and are capable of making us "wise unto salvation.<a name=7:18></a>" The principle of inspiration and of authority then is established.<a name=7:19></a> The words of Mr.<a name=7:20></a> Scherer are but blasphemous words, and for him it is reduced to this -- the New Testament is not inspired; but he has not the faith to recognize that the Old Testament leaves no foundation to his arguments.<a name=7:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=8>[Page 8]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This should be thoroughly understood.<a name=8:1></a> The inspiration of the word of God is certain -- its divine authority incontestable.<a name=8:2></a> This then alone remains: whether according to the author of the letter, the New Testament is part of it?<a name=8:3></a> His principles are false.<a name=8:4></a> It must only be known if the judgments of a man who evades irrefragable proofs are worth anything, when this judgment is based upon these false, and even blasphemous principles.<a name=8:5></a> There are those who tell us that it is not -- that it is a mere human record of what the writers knew, either by their senses or by personal revelations to themselves, but which they were not inspired to write.<a name=8:6></a> Let us remember, however, that inspiration itself is denied.<a name=8:7></a> But he who denies inspiration denies that which the Lord and the apostles maintain; for they maintain the inspiration of the Old Testament.<a name=8:8></a> Such an one therefore forfeits all my confidence; and I cannot allow any weight to his judgment, when he tells me that the New Testament has not the authority of inspiration.<a name=8:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will not multiply quotations to prove that the prophets assert the inspiration of their prophecies; because it recurs at the beginning of almost every separate prophecy, but I will point out the passages in the New Testament which recognize the scriptures of the Old as having this authority.<a name=8:10></a> "All things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the Psalms, concerning me," Luke 24: 44.<a name=8:11></a> Jesus here recognizes the body of writings called the Old Testament in its three parts -- still thus entitled in the modern Hebrew Bibles.<a name=8:12></a> The Lord gives them equal authority in verse 27 -- "And, beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.<a name=8:13></a>" "Search the scriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal life; and they are they which testify of me," John 5: 39.<a name=8:14></a> "And the scripture cannot be broken," John 10: 35.<a name=8:15></a> These passages demonstrate that the scriptures of the Old Testament were a body of writings recognized by the Lord; and that in the detail of its present divisions it was recognized as having absolute authority.<a name=8:16></a> But to have these writings -- to have truths communicated in this form -- is something more than to have the truth spoken by word of mouth, even though it were by the mouth of the Lord Himself.<a name=8:17></a> "If ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?<a name=8:18></a>" John 5: 47.<a name=8:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=9>[Page 9]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The writings then were the object of faith, and consequently had the authority of the word of God.<a name=9:1></a> "They have Moses and the prophets, let them hear them.<a name=9:2></a>" "If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead," Luke 16: 29-31.<a name=9:3></a> When the apostle preached the truth at Berea, the Jews, his hearers, "searched the scriptures daily whether those things were so"; that is to say, they made use of the scriptures as an authority by which they judged the teaching even of an apostle; and they are commended for so doing; Acts 17: 11.<a name=9:4></a> The inspiration then of the Old Testament is demonstrated, its authority is recognized by the Lord, and the whole -- as we possess it -- is declared to be authentic and to be clothed with an authority which nothing can invalidate.<a name=9:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"The scriptures," as a whole, are owned of God as a distinct class of writings, having a certain authority, namely, that of HIS WORD.<a name=9:6></a> As it is written in Proverbs 30: 5, 6 -- "Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him.<a name=9:7></a> Add thou not to his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.<a name=9:8></a>" Finally, the apostle Paul (2 Timothy 3: 16) gives a remarkable testimony to the same effect -- a testimony which clearly designates this class of writings: "All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness; that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.<a name=9:9></a>" We have only, therefore, to learn whether the New Testament forms part of "the scriptures," or whether the church is without a divine communication specially given to herself, and possesses only the Old Testament.<a name=9:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here I would notice the folly of a principle set forth by the letter -- that the claim to inspiration is necessarily limited to the book which makes the claim, or at least to the writings of the same author.<a name=9:11></a> This assertion is futile.<a name=9:12></a> Why could not an inspired author, or the Lord, declare all the other books, or some amongst them, to be inspired?<a name=9:13></a> And, on the other hand, there is no necessity that the other writings of an author should be inspired because one of them is so.<a name=9:14></a> The Lord sets His seal to the entire Old Testament, and Paul declares that all scripture is given by inspiration of God.<a name=9:15></a> Does this only prove the inspiration of the Epistle to Timothy, in which the assertion is found?<a name=9:16></a> A man who seeks to overthrow the foundations of truth by such arguments as these deserves reproof rather than refutation.<a name=9:17></a>

		But I leave this point.<a name=10:6></a> That which Mr.<a name=10:7></a> Scherer says about the canon is also entirely without force.<a name=10:8></a> He maintains that we cannot avail ourselves of the New Testament till the canon is settled.<a name=10:9></a> Why not?<a name=10:10></a> Let us suppose that a wilding is found in my garden: can I therefore make no use of the good trees which are in it?<a name=10:11></a> Supposing the second Epistle of Peter were spurious, and if the Revelation merits all the reproaches which the letter's insolent pretension gives it, what has that to do with the epistles of John or of Paul?<a name=10:12></a> I might admit that one Epistle was questionable -- which, however, I do not admit -- without in the least questioning the others.<a name=10:13></a>

		In giving details for the inward regulation of a church (1 Corinthians 14: 36, 37), the apostle says, "Came the word of God out from you?<a name=11:1></a> or came it unto you only?<a name=11:2></a> If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord.<a name=11:3></a> But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.<a name=11:4></a>" The communications then of the Spirit to the church or to the world were the "word of God," and that which was written by the apostle to direct the saints was "the commandment of the Lord.<a name=11:5></a>" "For this cause," said the apostle to the Thessalonians (1 Thessalonians 2: 13), "we thank God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth THE WORD OF GOD, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.<a name=11:6></a>" Thus we see that the apostle puts his writings on the footing of "commandments of the Lord," with the sorrowful consolation for those who cannot discern it, "if any man be ignorant, LET HIM BE IGNORANT.<a name=11:7></a>" Now will anyone say that the apostle, acting in the self-same character, and addressing himself in the same manner, in virtue of his apostolic sanction and authority, to the Romans or to the Galatians, is less inspired than when he addresses the Corinthians?<a name=11:8></a> Such an argument deserves no other refutation than "if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.<a name=11:9></a>" To say God has willed that the faith of the Ephesians and Corinthians should rest upon divine inspiration, and that of the Romans and Galatians on a human basis, deserves no serious answer.<a name=11:10></a>

		How could there have been so suited a close to such a volume as the Bible?<a name=40:1></a> The Bible sets forth all the ways of God, from the creation to the return of that creation (long fallen, rebellious, and miserable, but now redeemed) into the order and blessing in which it is securely set by the fulness of God's grace; nothing being excluded save that which is incompatible with the blessing itself.<a name=40:2></a> It reveals the eternal Son of God acting in the midst of this whole scene, glorifying His Father, and bringing everything into a more beautiful order than had been lost.<a name=40:3></a> One can understand that a book like this would not close without taking up again all the threads of this wondrous, divine process, and exhibiting those results which, when the work of the Son is perfected, and all things subdued, will bring in the full and perfect dominion of the eternal God: the blessing of that God, who has made Himself known in Jesus.<a name=40:4></a> This is what the Apocalypse sets before us.<a name=40:5></a>

		One can understand, moreover, that when the inspired communications made to the church were about to be closed; when those who were commissioned by God to superintend were being removed; when evil, as the word everywhere testifies, was coming in like a flood; one can understand, I say, that the Spirit of God should have thus left to the church -- to the faithful who need it -- a moral summary, which could meet their need in the darkness gathering round them.<a name=41:1></a> Such a summary these chapters of Revelation afford us: a summary, which, if God arouses those who are His, explains to them the course and result of events which have taken place during the darkness, and makes manifest, even though the church may have slumbered, that nothing has happened without God; a summary, which gives warning also of the judgment which will fall upon the professing church, as the result of her unfaithfulness to God and to the light which He has dispensed, and makes room for His dealing with the world.<a name=41:2></a> This terrific judgment is the consequence of man's rejection and corruption of God's last and most gracious manifestation of Himself.<a name=41:3></a> The consummated iniquity of that which professes to be the church leaves room for nothing but judgment; and, when this judgment is executed, this closing book of scripture tells us that righteousness will be established in the world by divine power.<a name=41:4></a>

		There is an important point which I have not yet brought forward, and on which I would add a few words; that is, the authority of the word, independently of the effect it produces on the heart.<a name=45:15></a> I may be led to recognize the authority of the word of God, through the effect which it has produced in my soul; but evidently, it is not this effect which gives it its authority.<a name=45:16></a> If the word produces this effect, it is because it possessed the authority which I recognize, before I yielded to it.<a name=45:17></a> I recognize it, because it exists.<a name=45:18></a> If Christ pronounced the words of God, His words had authority, notwithstanding the unbelief of His hearers; that is, they possessed intrinsic authority.<a name=45:19></a> Nor have they lost it, by being written.<a name=45:20></a> The Lord speaks (John 5) of "writings" being the highest order of means of communication.<a name=45:21></a> If the apostle has made the will of God known to us in "words which the Holy Ghost teacheth," the revelations he received and thus communicated have a divine authority over the conscience, even though they should be rejected by man.<a name=45:22></a> The authority of the word does not depend upon its being received by him who hears.<a name=45:23></a> It is not he who is to judge it, except at his own peril.<a name=45:24></a> "The words that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.<a name=45:25></a>" Here is what is called possessing an authority independent of him who pretends to judge of it.<a name=45:26></a>

		We are not now discussing the authenticity of the testimony, but its authority, allowing it to be authentic.<a name=46:1></a> Wherein lies this authority?<a name=46:2></a> Suppose two persons read a portion of the Bible: the heart of one is touched and convinced of the divine authority of what he reads; the other remains in his unbelief.<a name=46:3></a> Does the authority of the word depend on the faith of one who believes, or is it the same for both, although unrecognized by him who believes not?<a name=46:4></a> It is evident that either he who believed was mistaken, or, if not, that the authority of the book, although unrecognized by the unbeliever, is as great for him as for the one who bowed to it.<a name=46:5></a> The authority lies then in the word itself, independently of the effect produced by it, or of the opinion man forms of it.<a name=46:6></a> It possesses intrinsic authority.<a name=46:7></a> The judgment of the last day will prove it.<a name=46:8></a> "The words that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.<a name=46:9></a>" It could not be otherwise with the word of God; but it is important clearly to establish this principle.<a name=46:10></a> The word of God cannot be useful if it is not received, but it has no less all authority because it is the word of God.<a name=46:11></a> Unless to deny the existence of all divine communication one cannot doubt this principle.<a name=46:12></a> To deny all communication is unbelief.<a name=46:13></a> We do not want to reason on what the church possesses in the scriptures, but to convince the unbeliever.<a name=46:14></a> And more, unbelief does not destroy the authority of the word, for the rebellion of man destroys not the authority of God.<a name=46:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The word itself establishes this.<a name=46:16></a> "And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear; for they are most rebellious," Ezekiel 2: 7; compare 1 John 3: 11-27.<a name=46:17></a> "He that believeth hath the witness in himself": this is the inward power of the testimony.<a name=46:18></a> "He that believeth not God hath made him a liar": here is the guilt of him who believes not.<a name=46:19></a> Thus the authority of testimony from God is independent of the judgment which man may pronounce upon it.<a name=46:20></a> The testimony will itself judge man.<a name=46:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Other passages which are derived from this principle apply it to scripture as a body of writings.<a name=47:1></a> "And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus," 2 Timothy 3: 15.<a name=47:2></a> Here the sacred letter, or scripture, has an authority over man from his childhood, still rendering the man of God perfect.<a name=47:3></a> Then it is not the judgment that the man of God had of the scripture that marked their value.<a name=47:4></a> He who knew their value, as rendering the man of God perfect, acknowledged their authority over him when he must have been thoroughly incapable of judging.<a name=47:5></a> That is, they had a full and absolute authority over him independent of his capacity to receive them, a divine and intrinsic authority.<a name=47:6></a> The most advanced man of God is happy to receive them in the same spirit; 1 Peter 2: 1.<a name=47:7></a> 2.<a name=47:8></a> The apostle formally states the principle of authority in the same passage: "stand fast in the things which thou hast learnt, and which have been entrusted to thee, knowing from whom thou hast learnt them.<a name=47:9></a>" It is the authority of him who had taught them which was the reason for holding them fast.<a name=47:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The intrinsic authority, then, of the testimony of scripture is clearly established.<a name=47:11></a> It is an authority independent of the reception of the testimony by the hearer; so entirely independent, that the word will judge him who is not obedient to it.<a name=47:12></a> This proves to us that God has endued it with moral evidence, powerful enough to bring in as guilty the man who does not receive the testimony, and who thereby treats God as a liar.<a name=47:13></a> Nevertheless it is only the grace of God which can overcome the moral resistance of man's heart, unbelieving as it is by nature and by will as to the things of God, though full of credulity as to the things of man.<a name=47:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another point which I have only glanced at, and which I desire to put forward a little more plainly.<a name=47:15></a> Many circumstances testify, that the narratives of the evangelists were written not merely by man, but by the Holy Ghost.<a name=47:16></a> For instance, John was one of the three apostles who were with Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane, an attendant upon the scene of His agony.<a name=47:17></a> He says nothing about it.<a name=47:18></a> Nothing could be more affecting and more solemn.<a name=47:19></a> John most certainly had not forgotten it, for he relates many other of the circumstances which are not to be found in the other Gospels; for instance, that those who came to take Jesus "went backward and fell to the ground," and yet respecting the Saviour's agony he makes not the slightest mention.<a name=47:20></a> John accompanied Jesus also to the cross; yet he says not a word of His having been forsaken of God, although he relates a multitude of other circumstances, which prove that the Saviour was as calm there as when he describes Him to us in the garden.<a name=47:21></a> A man who had written the history of the sufferings of the Saviour would not have failed to relate things so deeply interesting, and of which he had himself been an eye-witness.<a name=47:22></a> Matthew also would have related the remarkable incident which occurred in the garden of Gethsemane, of which he was an eye-witness, namely, that they all fell to the ground; but he does not mention it, whilst he gives an account of the agony of Jesus and His prayer, although he was not one of three who accompanied Him at that time.<a name=47:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now if you examine these Gospels, you will find that this peculiarity -- inexplicable as it would be if they were not inspired -- becomes quite intelligible, when we recognize their inspiration.<a name=48:1></a> One and the same author wrote them all.<a name=48:2></a> The Holy Ghost, whose office it is to take of the things of Christ and to shew them unto us, furnishes us in John with those circumstances of the history of Jesus, which would bring out the glory of His Person as Son of God -- the glory of Him "who offered Himself to God" for us.<a name=48:3></a> In Matthew He gives us that which is needed to make known the suffering Messiah.<a name=48:4></a> The result is, not only harmony between the parts of each Gospel, but also between all the Gospels; producing a perfect whole -- exhibiting the design and the workmanship of one and the same author.<a name=48:5></a> This principle is applicable to the entire contents of the four Gospels.<a name=48:6></a> I have only called the reader's attention to the garden of Gethsemane and to the cross, as striking instances.<a name=48:7></a> One who is well versed in the Gospels, and who has spiritual discernment, would know by the manner in which a subject is presented in which Gospel it is to be found.<a name=48:8></a> Compare the connection between the end of Matthew 21 and the parable in the beginning of chapter 22: also the way in which the corresponding parable in Luke 16: 16 is introduced, with that of the husbandmen in Luke 20, and you will perceive that the substance, the form, and the diversities of these parables are in perfect harmony with the design of each Gospel.<a name=48:9></a> In Matthew, we have the rejection of Christ in connection with the relation of the Messiah to the Jews; in Luke, the moral order of the events, the acts and ways of the God of grace, founded on the broader, more moral, and less official basis of the character of the Son of man.<a name=48:10></a> The same thing may be observed in comparing Matthew 24 and Luke 21.<a name=48:11></a>

		There is another testimony to the truth of inspiration, the peculiar character of which deserves the reader's attention.<a name=49:1></a> It applies specially to the Old Testament, but it brings out very clearly the difference between the inspiration of the Old and that of the New.<a name=49:2></a> It is that the prophets did not understand their own prophecies, but studied them as we might do.<a name=49:3></a> We read in 1 Peter 1: 11, "Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.<a name=49:4></a> Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves but unto us they did minister," etc.<a name=49:5></a> The prophets searched into that which the Holy Ghost had spoken through themselves.<a name=49:6></a> Their inspiration was so absolute, and so independent of the workings of their own minds, that they inquired into the meaning of that which they uttered, as any of us might do.<a name=49:7></a> This is not precisely the character of the inspiration of the New Testament; but it is not, therefore, the less real.<a name=49:8></a> Its character is declared in the succeeding word -- "reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven.<a name=49:9></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"The Holy Ghost sent down from heaven" leads into all truth; and thus inspiration acts in the understanding and by the understanding; but it is not on that account the less inspiration.<a name=49:10></a> On the contrary, the apostle Paul preferred the inspiration which acts by the understanding to that which is apparently more independent of it.<a name=49:11></a> 1 Corinthians 14: 14-19: "If I pray in a tongue, my spirit prayeth; but my understanding is unfruitful.<a name=49:12></a>" Daniel 12: 8, gives us an example of that which Peter describes -- "And I heard, but understood not; then said I, O my Lord, what shall be the end of these things?<a name=49:13></a> And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end.<a name=49:14></a>"

		The reader will remember that the passage I have quoted is the one to which the Lord Himself referred the disciples, in order that they might understand it.<a name=50:1></a> Now if the prophet did not understand the revelation he gave, if the prophets searched into the signification of their own prophecies, it is most evident that those prophecies were given through direct and positive inspiration.<a name=50:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I desire to add a thought which tends to confirm the truth I seek to maintain, and which applies to the whole of the Bible.<a name=50:3></a> Our attention is called to the fact that the Bible is not one book, but a collection of writings by different authors.<a name=50:4></a> It is precisely on this fact that I ground my argument, adding also that they were written at periods very remote from each other.<a name=50:5></a> In spite of this great diversity of times and of authors there is a perfect unity of design and of doctrine: a unity, the separate parts of which are so linked with each other, and so entirely adapted to each other, that the whole work is evidently that of one and the same Spirit, one and the same mind, with one purpose carried on from the beginning to the end, whatever might be the date of each separate book; and this, not at all by means of mere uniformity of idea, for the promises are quite distinct from the law; and the gospel of grace is distinct from them both.<a name=50:6></a> Nevertheless, its parts are so correlative and form so harmonious a whole, that, with the least attention, one cannot fail to perceive, that it is the production of one mind.<a name=50:7></a> Now there is but One, who lived through all the ages during which the various books of the Bible were written, and that One is the Holy Ghost.<a name=50:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Look at Genesis: you will find in it doctrines, promises, types, which are in perfect harmony with that which is more fully developed in the New Testament; but in this book they are related in the way of narrative with the greatest simplicity, yet in such a manner as to give the most perfect picture of things, which should happen in after ages.<a name=50:9></a> Feelings natural to piety (speaking historically) are so related as to possess a meaning, which, when we have the key to it, throws light upon the most precious doctrines of the New Testament, and the most remarkable events of prophecy.<a name=50:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Look at Exodus, and you will find the same thing.<a name=50:11></a> Every thing is made according to the pattern seen by Moses in the mount, and furnishes us with the clearest exposition we possess of the ways of God in Christ.<a name=50:12></a> At the same time the law is given -- and yet the law is not imitated in the gospel, which does not so much as contain a copy of it.<a name=50:13></a> Nevertheless, the law is linked with the gospel in a manner which makes it impossible to separate them, and which gives to the authority of this revelation a divine and absolute character.<a name=50:14></a> Were it not so, Christ would have died to suffer the consequences of a partially human institution; for He bore the curse of the law.<a name=50:15></a> Observe this carefully: it was "the curse of the law" revealed to man, and of which He said, that not one jot or tittle should pass away till all were fulfilled.<a name=50:16></a> And moreover, it was not when reasoning with the Jews, upon their own ground, that Christ said this, but when teaching His disciples, according to His own perfect wisdom, and solemnly setting before them the principles of His kingdom.<a name=50:17></a>

		Take Leviticus: the details of its sacrifices furnish a light, which throws upon the work of Christ rays so bright that nothing could replace them; supplying a key to all the workings of the human heart, and an answer to all its need, such as it is found even among the heathen.<a name=51:1></a> These details prefigure every aspect of the work of Christ, as doctrinally unfolded in the New Testament, whether by Himself or by His apostles; yet, to their inspired writer, they were only Jewish ordinances.<a name=51:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Take Numbers -- the history of the journeyings of God's people through the wilderness.<a name=51:3></a> "These things," says the apostle, "happened to them for examples [types], and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come.<a name=51:4></a>" Who was it that wrote them for us?<a name=51:5></a> Certainly not Moses (although he was the human instrument), but He who knoweth the end from the beginning, and who orders all things according to His good pleasure.<a name=51:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All the circumstances of Christian life are found treasured up in these oracles, in so complete a manner, that the apostle could say, "They are able to make us wise unto salvation through faith in Jesus Christ.<a name=51:7></a>" On the other hand, the New Testament is equally far from merely repeating the substance of the Old, or from making void its authority.<a name=51:8></a> It brings in an altogether new light -- a light which (while setting aside a multitude of things as fulfilled) throws upon the Old Testament a radiance which alone gives its contents their true bearing.<a name=51:9></a> All this applies to the moral and to the ceremonial law; to the history of the patriarchs; to the royalties of David and of Solomon; to the sentiments expressed in the Psalms, as well as to other subjects.<a name=51:10></a> Is it not one mind which has done all this?<a name=51:11></a> Was it the mind of Moses or of Paul?<a name=51:12></a> Assuredly not.<a name=51:13></a>

		Observe also, that all this refers to Christ, and to all the various glories of Christ -- glories which God alone knew so as to reveal them beforehand, and to give, in the history and ordinances of His people, and even in that which is related of the world, precisely that which would serve for the development of all that was to be manifested in His Son Jesus.<a name=52:1></a> Accordingly, what says Peter?<a name=52:2></a> (Acts 2.<a name=52:3></a>) "Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day.<a name=52:4></a> Therefore, being a prophet, and seeing this before, he spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.<a name=52:5></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not go through other books of the Bible to furnish proofs of this unity of design, which is manifested in a work wrought by such various instruments, and at periods so remote from each other -- a unity realised in such a manner as precludes all idea of its having been intended by the persons who executed it.<a name=52:6></a> I only use the fact here in confirmation of the principle which I maintain; but to one who has any knowledge of the word of God, it is an incontestable proof.<a name=52:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I add but one word.<a name=52:8></a> In judging of inspiration by the precision of the account, a mistake is often committed as to what should be sought for.<a name=52:9></a> The Holy Ghost does not aim at that accuracy which would be needful to prove the truthfulness of man.<a name=52:10></a> The Holy Ghost has always a moral or spiritual object -- the revelation of some eternal principle of truth and grace.<a name=52:11></a> Every circumstance which has no bearing upon His object is omitted.<a name=52:12></a> He regards not accuracy in that respect.<a name=52:13></a> But the moral accuracy is all the greater on this account, and the picture presented to the conscience much more complete.<a name=52:14></a> The introduction of something needful to human accuracy, would spoil the perfection of the whole as God's testimony.<a name=52:15></a> God does not seek to amuse the mind of man by stories to no purpose, but to instruct his heart by truth.<a name=52:16></a> This might sometimes make it rather difficult to balance the whole as a mere narrative; but there are two ways of explaining the cause of a difficulty -- the ignorance of him who feels the difficulty, or the impossibility of the thing which has perplexed him.<a name=52:17></a> And man willingly attributes to the latter cause that which proceeds from the former.<a name=52:18></a> He who understands the designs of the Holy Ghost in what He says seizes the perfection of the word, where the mind of man is perplexed by a thousand difficulties.<a name=52:19></a>

		ON THE WORK OF CHRIST; OR, REMARKS ON THE SECOND LETTER OF MR. EDMOND SCHERER
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Mr.<a name=54:1></a> Scherer has added a second letter to that already known and has just published them together.<a name=54:2></a> His aim is to shew that faith can abide intact spite of the denial of the inspiration of the scriptures; but this second letter is already the full proof of the contrary.<a name=54:3></a> The doctrine it contains is simply, in very fair phrases, the denial of the expiation of Christ and of the doctrine of justification by faith which flows from it.<a name=54:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The system of Mr.<a name=54:5></a> Scherer, who has not even the merit of originality, is only a diluted Irvingism.<a name=54:6></a> Besides it is the adoration of man, coloured with a certain mystic tint.<a name=54:7></a> Under the pretext of glorifying the Person of Christ, mysticism denies the efficacy of His work.<a name=54:8></a> Further, without the doctrine of expiation (such is the deceitfulness of the heart), admiration of the Person of Christ and of His life may be self-admiration.<a name=54:9></a> Christ was a man; and, by deifying man in Him, people put on themselves the crown of His glory under the pretext of the duty and capability of being like Him internally.<a name=54:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This system pretends to something more real, more intimate, more personal in religion.<a name=54:11></a> Poor heart of man!<a name=54:12></a> When will it learn that nothing so humbles it (and this is what is wanted), that nothing operates in it so strongly, in the way needed, as the knowledge that all has been done outside itself?<a name=54:13></a> Glorying in one's humility, and being indeed humble, are two very different things.<a name=54:14></a> It is not by thinking of oneself, in order to imitate humility, that one becomes humble; it is by being debtor for all to the grace of Him who has saved us.<a name=54:15></a> Pharisaism does not consist in attributing everything to oneself, but in blessing God for what one is, instead of blessing Him for what He is, Himself.<a name=54:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not pretend to handle this question thoroughly, but only to examine some points in Mr.<a name=54:17></a> Scherer's letter.<a name=54:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is no novelty in his system, except that he excludes, as uninspired, what the mystics confine themselves to letting alone, namely, all the Holy Ghost's teaching by the apostles.<a name=54:19></a> See pages 33 and 34, where the thing is plainly stated.<a name=54:20></a> "You ask me," says he, "what remains of Christianity, when the dogma of inspiration is thrown out?<a name=54:21></a> 'Jesus Christ remains.<a name=54:22></a>' What remains of scripture?<a name=54:23></a> 'The history of Jesus Christ.<a name=54:24></a>'"

		We find in this second letter the same levity as in the first in assertions about serious matters, and in cases when the smallest examination would have shewn how destitute of foundation those assertions are.<a name=55:1></a> There is the same inflation of style, serving to veil capital vices in the reasoning, and to conceal unbelief and the desire of exalting man.<a name=55:2></a> "Have you not found," says he, "salvation and life in Jesus Christ?<a name=55:3></a> and if it is so, how can you fear, lest any fact whatever should weaken this fact of immediate certainty?<a name=55:4></a>" (Page 28.<a name=55:5></a>) But it is not the fact of my possessing eternal life that this foolish doctrine weakens; it is the certainty of the truths that God uses as the means to communicate and maintain life.<a name=55:6></a> To deny inspiration is to deny the certain communication of truth on the part of God.<a name=55:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Very far" (the author tells us) "from being incompatible with criticism, faith carries a critical force in itself.<a name=55:8></a>" (Page 29,) This contradicts the sufficiency of moral certitude, and the historical proofs of which he speaks in his first letter.<a name=55:9></a> But, passing over that, there is little but words in this phrase.<a name=55:10></a> How does the fact that faith possesses a critical force shew that something else has that force?<a name=55:11></a> So far as there is any force in the reasoning, the reasoning itself precisely shews the contrary of what Mr.<a name=55:12></a> Scherer pretends to establish; for, if faith carries a critical force in itself, faith, having made its own criticism, excludes thereby the possibility of questioning its judgment: otherwise, its judgment is null.<a name=55:13></a> It pronounces, because it discerns.<a name=55:14></a> If I say, the tongue has in itself the capacity to discern the taste of what touches it, by attributing this faculty to the tongue, I exclude all judgment pronounced on the decision of the tongue; if not, I deny what I have just affirmed.<a name=55:15></a> The tongue says that honey is sweet.<a name=55:16></a> Who disputes its decision?<a name=55:17></a> Who disputes the power of the tongue -- the very thing one has just been affirming?<a name=55:18></a> And this is owing to a special connection between the quality of an object, and the capacity to discern this quality.<a name=55:19></a> Thus, faith is faith, because it receives and understands the things of God, which are in connection with a capacity proper to faith; that is, the critical force which it has in itself implies the incompatibility of all other criticisms.<a name=55:20></a> This is so much the more true, because the quality recognized by faith excludes by this very fact all other criticism; for faith recognizes the authority of God in that which it receives; it believes God; otherwise it is not faith.<a name=55:21></a> Who will criticize God and His words?<a name=55:22></a> But, until one has received a communication as being such, faith is not in activity.<a name=55:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=56>[Page 56]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This manner of expressing oneself is, however, very imperfect, because it takes in only the fact of the existence of faith in man.<a name=56:1></a> The word of God, as is always the case, gives us much more light than the best reasonings.<a name=56:2></a> "The spiritual man," it tells us, "judgeth [discerneth] all things, yet he himself is judged [discerned] of no man," 1 Corinthians 2: 15.<a name=56:3></a> There is the criticism with which all other criticism is incompatible.<a name=56:4></a> And what is the force of this expression?<a name=56:5></a> It is, that God is there introduced, and that the Spirit of God is in the spiritual man, directing him and conducting him.<a name=56:6></a> He discerns all things because he is spiritual.<a name=56:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, mark well too the effect of this truth.<a name=56:8></a> The Holy Ghost, working in man, does not exclude the responsibility of man; on the contrary, it gives him the right feeling of his relationship with God, and judges all that is inconsistent with that relationship.<a name=56:9></a> He does not act independently of the Lord, because He subjects man to God, and to what God has said.<a name=56:10></a> This was true in the case of Christ, and perfectly true in Him only.<a name=56:11></a> In us "the flesh lusteth against the Spirit," tending always to produce imperfection in discernment and conduct.<a name=56:12></a> And again the Holy Ghost, working in man, does not exclude the faculties of man; He uses them; He is not judged by them.<a name=56:13></a> He uses them, so that it is human intelligence employed on all the subjects with which the Holy Ghost can occupy it, but employed by Him, enlightened by Him, receiving a capacity, in a certain sense, divine, without ceasing at the same time to be human.<a name=56:14></a> Man is thus delivered from the dominion of his corrupt nature.<a name=56:15></a> Reason neither judges nor governs; for if it does, it is only the will of man aspiring to independence, that is, excluding God, and always wrong by the very fact of this exclusion.<a name=56:16></a> When God is not already supreme, and His authority absolute in the eyes of a man, the man is altogether in a lie, because he is not in his moral place.<a name=56:17></a> But, while employing and in a divine way enlarging the capacity of man, the Holy Ghost submits him necessarily to God, makes God known to him, makes him receive what is of God -- the word -- because it is the perfect expression of the judgment of God.<a name=56:18></a> It is true that the flesh "lusteth against the Spirit," so that imperfection is there.<a name=56:19></a> The result is not one of absolute perfection.<a name=56:20></a> It is only in as much as he is spiritual, as I have already said, that a man discerns all things.<a name=56:21></a>

		The Spirit not only makes man subject to God, places him thus morally in what is true, and renders him capable of morally discerning; but He delivers him from the influence of the carnal motives which constantly vitiated his judgment.<a name=57:1></a> The Spirit presents to the affections of man, God in Christ, as well as a development of the truth, in all the relationships of man with God, as sinner and as saint, and that according to the height of the Person and work of Christ, and it is His work alone which gives us the true estimate of sin.<a name=57:2></a> Christ always estimated sin according to God; but, as to us sinners, it is only in the cross that we perfectly estimate it, because we there see it outside ourselves, in whom all is darkened by sin.<a name=57:3></a> It is there that the hatred of man against God, and the love of God for man, have met in one and the same act; and it is there that the moral state of man and the perfect revelation of God have been completely brought into evidence.<a name=57:4></a> That act is, at the same time, righteousness and salvation, death and judgment, as they were never manifested before, and never will be; and in that act they have been manifested as salvation and as life, the means which God has opened for His sovereign love and the salvation of the believer.<a name=57:5></a>

		The insulting spear, which struck the Saviour when already dead, only brought forth the water and the blood which atone for and cleanse the sin which made them flow.<a name=57:6></a>

		Man, morally, his affections, his judgment, are thus purified by that Jesus whom the Holy Ghost presents to him, -- that he may possess Him in his heart.<a name=57:7></a> Sweet and sanctifying proof of the Father's love!<a name=57:8></a> The Holy Ghost in man is a real and divine power; but He also works morally, and in the intelligence of him in whom He dwells.<a name=57:9></a> The spiritual man discerneth all things.<a name=57:10></a> All means are at his disposal.<a name=57:11></a> He judges all things, he takes knowledge of all things if needful, according to the Spirit and by His direction.<a name=57:12></a> It is not his reason which judges; he judges spiritually of all things.<a name=57:13></a> He judges himself instead of pretending to judge God, as if he had a capacity independent of Him.<a name=57:14></a> It is this that is incompatible with faith; this is that criticism which is incompatible with faith, because faith acknowledges God, and judges that proud criticism, which, in its folly, would judge God.<a name=57:15></a>

		If then one would speak of faith, it is because it has a sovereign power of criticism, because it is incompatible with criticism.<a name=58:1></a> That which criticizes supremely cannot be criticized, it would be a flagrant contradiction.<a name=58:2></a> "The spiritual man," says Paul (for faith is an abstraction), "judgeth [discerneth] all things, and he himself is judged [discerned] of no man," 1 Corinthians 2: 15.<a name=58:3></a>

		What is this "transformation" of faith or of truth?<a name=58:4></a> It purifies itself, you say, rejecting every foreign substance.<a name=58:5></a> Well and good; but what is that movement in which "the constitutive elements of truth are found to be carried away"?<a name=58:6></a> Is not the truth of God stable, immutable, and eternal, transforming man by its power and by grace, but remaining ever itself, and ever the same?<a name=58:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Mr.<a name=58:8></a> Scherer -- and this is convenient -- wishes one to have the courage to set aside the dogmatic notion of inspiration, and place oneself, with the appearance of faith, on the free ground of the historical point of view, etc.<a name=58:9></a> It is clear that if I do that, all is done.<a name=58:10></a> "The assurance of faith," say you?<a name=58:11></a> In what?<a name=58:12></a> Founded on what?<a name=58:13></a> On Jesus Christ, will you tell me?<a name=58:14></a> But how should I have a divine history of Him, without there being a divine capacity to write it?<a name=58:15></a> It is a book that I read, it is not Himself that I see.<a name=58:16></a> Mr.<a name=58:17></a> Scherer will tell me that what I read is evidently divine.<a name=58:18></a> Agreed.<a name=58:19></a> But you must fully bear in mind that you have not Jesus personally.<a name=58:20></a> You have only what is written: it is that which must be divine, if the Jesus whom I know is divine.<a name=58:21></a> Is it man that does what is divine?<a name=58:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Mr.<a name=58:23></a> Scherer acknowledges fully that, in order to invent Jesus Christ, one must have been Christ himself.<a name=58:24></a> In effect, it is morally impossible to form a just idea of such a character, without having in one the moral elements of that character -- without being oneself what He is.<a name=58:25></a> I add, that we have this security further than the fact of invention -- for this fact would have been the denial of that character, so that we must necessarily have the thing itself.<a name=58:26></a> Now, this is what we have by writing: who is capable of it?<a name=58:27></a> Man, or the men who wrote it?<a name=58:28></a> Then they are all Jesuses -- they are all inspired!<a name=58:29></a> This is so much the more evident, because, in order to have this perfect and adorable being, more men than one were employed.<a name=58:30></a> This history is not their own act; it is a whole which reproduces Him of whom they speak.<a name=58:31></a> Finally, if a man who has faith rids himself of the scriptures which serve as a foundation to faith, the question is not to know if he loses his own faith, but if he has not destroyed the foundations on which the faith of others may rest, and level the faithfulness of God, if he has not destroyed the very foundations of his own.<a name=58:32></a> For, if God has not spoken, on what is faith founded?<a name=58:33></a> If God has spoken by a man, then the man is inspired.<a name=58:34></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#65:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>In reading this passage in Greek, which treats of the chief point of Mr. Scherer's system, and which teaches as being essentially the gospel precisely what Mr. Scherer denies, the light becomes still more striking. Three participles are dependent on the words, "God was in Christ," and point out three things which flow from this, of which the last is ministry of the Spirit confided to the apostles, to render testimony to the work of Christ as means of reconciliation, by the truth of God, after Christ had been rejected as living on the earth "God was in Christ" reconciling, not imputing sins, and committing to us the ministry of reconciliation. But this ministry was founded on the fact -- become a dogma, in the ministry which spoke of it -- that Christ has been made sin for us. Reconciliation is not then the reconciliation of man, or of humanity united to God in Christ, but reconciliation performed by Christ -- made sin for him who was separated from God.

		Need I recall to the reader what a place the death and work of the Saviour holds in all the Bible, from the sacrifice of Abel and the fifty-third chapter of Isaiah up to the song of the apostle and church in the Revelation?<a name=68:3></a> We have seen the apostles attribute reconciliation to His death, to the death of Him who suffered "the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God.<a name=68:4></a>" He "came to give his life a ransom for many," Matthew 20: 23.<a name=68:5></a> "Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many," Hebrews 9: 28.<a name=68:6></a> "Who, his own self, bare our sins in his own body on the tree," 1 Peter 2: 24.<a name=68:7></a> "He is the propitiation for our sins," 1 John 2: 2.<a name=68:8></a> "Who was delivered for our offences, and raised again for our justification," Romans 4: 25.<a name=68:9></a> It is, I think, useless to multiply passages, if the words of Isaiah, of Jesus, of John, of Peter, and of Paul are not enough.<a name=68:10></a> As to Paul, we have the declaration that it is of this truth, founded on the Person of Christ, that he has been ordained preacher.<a name=68:11></a> "For there is one God and one mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time, whereunto I am ordained a preacher," 1 Timothy 2: 5, 6, 7.<a name=68:12></a> Now it is not here only a question of inspiration.<a name=68:13></a> The ministry of reconciliation was confided to the apostles.<a name=68:14></a>

		One of two things: either the apostle was mistaken in supposing that the ministry of reconciliation was committed to him, and was also mistaken with respect to the means of this reconciliation and the subject of this ministry .<a name=68:15></a>.<a name=68:16></a>.<a name=68:17></a> or the doctrine of Mr.<a name=68:18></a> Scherer denies Christianity.<a name=68:19></a>

		REMARKS ON "CHRISTIANITY AND MODERN PROGRESS" BY THE REVEREND A. RALEIGH, D.D.
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Allow me to draw your attention to a recent publication which professes to give grounds for harmonizing Christianity and modern progress.<a name=72:1></a> Such a production ought to produce pain and sorrow, and be dealt with in the spirit which such sorrow will, through grace, engender.<a name=72:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Still I feel, as it has been brought under my eye, that I ought not to pass it over.<a name=72:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		No one, of course, is strictly responsible for it but the author; still, as it is an address from the Chair of the Congregational Union of England and Wales at its annual meeting, it acquires a weight which a mere individual discourse would not have.<a name=72:4></a> It shews the tone of the dissenting mind -- what finds utterance from the lips of those whom it sets in its high places and in the chief seats of its teachers.<a name=72:5></a> It shews us to what point the dissenting body is come in the conflict now going on between faith and unbelief; how completely the high and holy ground of possession of the truth by divine revelation is abandoned, to look for tolerance from the infidel reason of man without God in the world.<a name=72:6></a> It is, in fact, a humble supplication to the infidel to be allowed to have share in the inheritance of truth, admitting that they have it in their sphere, and craving the admission that the Christian has it in his.<a name=72:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The infidel reasoners are far enough from troubling their heads about the petitioners; as Dr.<a name=72:8></a> Raleigh admits, they turn up their noses with contempt at the evidences of Christianity.<a name=72:9></a> The air, he tells us, is weary with their repetitions of scorn at Christian creeds.<a name=72:10></a> But Dr.<a name=72:11></a> Raleigh begs for quarter.<a name=72:12></a> If they have scientific facts, Christianity has historic facts.<a name=72:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		No doubt Christianity has facts far better proved than any other facts of history, as every sober mind admits.<a name=72:14></a> Science has no such facts really.<a name=72:15></a> What are called the facts of science are merely the general laws deduced from phenomena or appearances; many, of course, I admit, adequately proved; but these, when of importance to our subject, are not really facts.<a name=72:16></a> Nobody unless some rare German, for I have known such, doubts of the astronomical system, demonstrated by the laws of a principle we call gravity.<a name=72:17></a> It is admitted because it accounts for the phenomena.<a name=72:18></a> I admit, if you please, as a fact, that the earth goes round the sun.<a name=72:19></a> Hence, when these laws are known, calculations can be made as to what will happen if all goes on as usual.<a name=72:20></a> In a word, appearances, accounted for by general laws, enable man's mind to draw mental consequences, that is, to calculate the ordinary succession of phenomena.<a name=72:21></a>

		In natural science facts have another place.<a name=73:1></a> They are observed in their present existence, and what is observed, and that only, is a fact.<a name=73:2></a> These facts are then generalized.<a name=73:3></a> Not into laws, such as the law of gravity, but into general principles of causes, or rather similarity and succession of forms.<a name=73:4></a> Be it that all animal being is reduced to cellular atoms: I have nothing against it.<a name=73:5></a> I leave science in possession of its facts, and the gradual development of theories connected with them.<a name=73:6></a> The uniformity of succession of facts may be adequately ascertained.<a name=73:7></a> Harvey may find that nothing had living being which was not previously in an egg, and sufficient instances may be found in various forms of being to justify a general conclusion.<a name=73:8></a> It may or may not be adequately investigated to justify the conclusion that the fact is universal.<a name=73:9></a> In these cases I dare say it is.<a name=73:10></a> Still the conclusion is not a fact.<a name=73:11></a> It is sufficient to make a science for classification, and for man to act on and to learn by.<a name=73:12></a>

		So in geology, though facts are much less accurately ascertained, still we may say a general succession of formation in a certain order is pretty well ascertained, sufficiently so to classify, though with defects and difficulties, and to form a science.<a name=73:13></a> Now no Christian has the slightest interest in combating these facts, nor, if done honestly and simply, scientific generalizations from them.<a name=73:14></a> But man's conclusions are not facts.<a name=73:15></a> Sir C.<a name=73:16></a> Lyell finds a skull or some evidence of human existence in the delta of the Mississippi, begins to calculate the silt deposited by the river, and says man must have lived 100,000 years.<a name=73:17></a> This I read in his second edition.<a name=73:18></a> I gave it away and got afterwards the third, and here he admits he was wrongly informed as to the data, and it must have been 50,000 years.<a name=73:19></a> Now, when I find such leaps as this, to say nothing of other questions, can I speak of facts?<a name=73:20></a> The fact is that there was a skull in the delta.<a name=73:21></a> All the rest is calculation or supposition.<a name=73:22></a>

		INTRODUCTION
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is impossible to treat the author of this book as a Christian.<a name=82:1></a> I do not say this as forming any judgment of his personal state in any way; I speak of the public profession of a religion he belongs to -- Christianity, as contrasted with heathenism, Mahometanism, Judaism, or Buddhism.<a name=82:2></a> Dr.<a name=82:3></a> Colenso states that "our belief in the living God remains as sure as ever, though not the Pentateuch only, but the whole Bible, were removed.<a name=82:4></a> It is written on our hearts by God's own finger as surely as by the hand of the apostle in the Bible, that 'God is, and is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.<a name=82:5></a>' It is written there also as plainly as in the Bible, that 'God is not mocked, that whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap,' and that 'he that soweth to the flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption.<a name=82:6></a>"' (Pages 53, 54.<a name=82:7></a>) That is, with the Bible, or without the Bible, Dr.<a name=82:8></a> C.<a name=82:9></a> believes in the existence of God and His rewarding them that seek Him, and in natural conscience.<a name=82:10></a> In other words (as far as his book goes, which he puts forth as a manifesto), he is a profound Deist.<a name=82:11></a> Even with the Bible he only believes so much as his heart and conscience recognize, and that the latter is to be preferred to the Bible as the means of knowing God: "that He Himself, the living God, our Father and Friend, is nearer and closer to us than any book can be; that His voice within the heart may be heard continually by the obedient child that listens for it, and <i>that</i> shall be our teacher and guide in the path of duty, which is the path of life, when all other helpers -- even the words of the best of books -- may fail us.<a name=82:12></a>" (Page 54.<a name=82:13></a>)

		Now it is clear that neither believing that God is, nor natural conscience, is believing in the special facts of Christianity -- the incarnation, atonement, resurrection, redemption, being born again, the exaltation of a Man to God's right hand, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.<a name=82:14></a> In a word, no special truth or <i>fact</i> of Christianity is "written on our hearts by God's own finger," or can be possessed by mere natural conscience or belief in God.<a name=82:15></a> All <i>intervention</i> of God is left out.<a name=82:16></a> But it is in this, and the statement of what led to its necessity, that revealed religion consists.<a name=82:17></a> There is a conscience in every man: the word of God acts on it.<a name=82:18></a> I do not doubt that there is an instinctive knowledge of a God and of judgment.<a name=82:19></a> This is all Dr.<a name=82:20></a> C.<a name=82:21></a> owns, with or without the Bible.<a name=82:22></a> Revealed religion is a series of divine and marvellous facts and truths, unfolding an intervention of God in grace with sinful man.<a name=82:23></a> He sets this aside; his relationship with God is not founded on it.<a name=82:24></a> He prefers, as teaching, what he has without it; that is, he wholly and professedly sets aside Christianity.<a name=82:25></a> He goes farther; he recognizes "the voice of God's Spirit .<a name=82:26></a>.<a name=82:27></a>.<a name=82:28></a> not in the Bible only, but out of the Bible; not to us Christians only, but to our fellow-men of all climes and countries, ages and religions, the same gracious Teacher is revealing, in different measures, according to His own good pleasure, the hidden things of God.<a name=82:29></a>" (Page 222.<a name=82:30></a>)

		Dr.<a name=83:1></a> C.<a name=83:2></a> has, in substance, solemnly declared that this is not so (see Article 18 of the Thirty-nine Articles); yet I suppose this is no matter with rationalists.<a name=83:3></a> But his statement amounts to this: -- Christians and heathens have all their particular religions; but, besides and within all this, all have a communication in their own hearts of the hidden things of God.<a name=83:4></a> The knowledge of God is not in the religion; for heathens and Christians have it more or less, whatever their religion, in their hearts.<a name=83:5></a> He confirms this by quotations from Cicero, Sikhs, and Hindoos.<a name=83:6></a> Cicero's statement (I suppose Dr.<a name=83:7></a> C.<a name=83:8></a> did not find it out) is merely asserting natural conscience, with the addition of a denial of the foundation-fact of revelation that man is a sinner driven out from God.<a name=83:9></a> "Whoever will not obey this law," says Cicero, "will be flying from himself, and having treated with contempt his human nature, will, in that very fact, pay the greatest penalty, even if he shall have escaped other punishments, as they are commonly considered.<a name=83:10></a>" Now this makes human nature the measure of good, as indeed Cicero everywhere does.<a name=83:11></a> And just see the result, which neither Dr.<a name=83:12></a> C.<a name=83:13></a> nor Lactantius, from whom he quotes, seem to have noticed.<a name=83:14></a> This law, or right reason, "to the good never commands or forbids in vain, never influences the wicked either by commanding or forbidding.<a name=83:15></a>" Could grace be more fully denied?<a name=83:16></a> Could the effect of law or conscience be more entirely mis-stated?<a name=83:17></a> There are good or wicked already-God knows how; and this law, or right reason, changes nothing -- always succeeds with one, and leaves the other where he is.<a name=83:18></a> This is, we are told, "a voice almost divine.<a name=83:19></a>" "The same divine Teacher revealed also to the Sikh Gurus (teachers) such great truths as these.<a name=83:20></a>" (Page 233.<a name=83:21></a>)

		He then quotes statements of the unity of God, but what is Pantheism, that is, that God is in everything; statements which recognize Mahomets, Brahmas, Vishnus, Sivas -- of course <i>not</i> Christ: and that is a revelation of God for Dr.<a name=84:1></a> C.<a name=84:2></a>!<a name=84:3></a> He then quotes from Hindoo writings "the following words, which were written by one who had no Pentateuch nor Bible to teach him, but who surely learned such living truths as these by the direct teaching of the Spirit of God.<a name=84:4></a>" (Page 224.<a name=84:5></a>) In these words God is celebrated, and there is a good deal of moralizing, such as may be found anywhere, but in which we find, "He that partaketh of but one grain of the love of God shall be released from the sinfulness of all his doubts and actions" -- a comfortable quietus.<a name=84:6></a> "I take for my spiritual food the water and the leaf of Ram.<a name=84:7></a>" "God dwelleth in the mind, and none other but God.<a name=84:8></a>"

		THE FAMILY OF JUDAH
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first objection is that in Genesis 46.<a name=89:9></a> Hezron and Hamul are stated to have gone down to Egypt, and consequently to have been born in Canaan; but that this is impossible if the ages of Judah and Joseph be considered.<a name=89:10></a> It is contended that Judah was forty-two when Jacob went down into Egypt, inasmuch as Joseph was thirty-nine.<a name=89:11></a> Genesis 30: 24-26; chapter 31: 41, are cited to prove that Joseph was born in the seventh, Judah in the fourth, year "of Jacob's double marriage.<a name=89:12></a>" The impossibility of Hezron and Hamul's going down to Egypt arises from this, that Judah was twenty when Joseph went down into Egypt, and that Hezron and Hamul, who rank in point of time with Judah's great-grandchildren, though his own grandchildren by Tamar, could not have been born when he was forty-two, that is, twenty-two years afterwards.<a name=89:13></a> On the other hand, it is insisted that the narrative of Jacob's going down makes sixty-six souls go with him, and there are not sixty-six without Hezron and Hamul.<a name=89:14></a>
	</div>

		There is no ground for the objection at all.<a name=90:1></a> I do not insist on the uncertainty of the exact difference between the ages of Judah and Joseph, as what might be added, even if just, would hardly clear up the point; though, bringing it perhaps within the limits of possibility, it is sufficient to throw doubt on Dr.<a name=90:2></a> C.<a name=90:3></a>'s assertions.<a name=90:4></a> But Genesis 46 is simply to record the immediate descendants of Jacob who were associated with himself in Egypt to give his family.<a name=90:5></a> Thus Er and Onan are noticed; only, it is added, they died in Canaan.<a name=90:6></a> It is then added, "and the sons of Pharez <i>were</i> Hezron and Hamul.<a name=90:7></a>" This twelfth verse is distinctly genealogy, not that all went down into Egypt who are named in it; for Er and Onan are named because they are sons, while it is expressly stated they did not go down at all.<a name=90:8></a><a href="#90:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In verse 12 the introduction of "were" is emphatic, and the phrase, I apprehend, clearly intended to be supplementary.<a name=90:9></a> It is not "Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and Zarah, and the sons of Pharez, Hezron and Hamul," which would clearly have been the case if they had been goers down into Egypt.<a name=90:10></a> But the historian stops at Zarah, and adds supplementary information: Er and Onan were on the list of sons, but they did not go down -- they died before -- and Pharez's sons were Hezron and Hamul.<a name=90:11></a> They are looked at as filling up the breach, but the latter half of the verse is (in contrast with going down) an explanation of the history of that family.<a name=90:12></a> As if he had said, These were Judah's sons, but I must add this explanation to the statement: Er and Onan never got down, for they died, and Pharez had two sons, who are counted in to supply their place.<a name=90:13></a> For though the leading thought be the going down of the family into Egypt, yet in order to this he gives the whole family; and that this is so is evident, for he introduces Joseph's sons, adding, that they were born in Egypt.<a name=90:14></a> Indeed I think it very questionable whether all Benjamin's sons were born when he came into Egypt.<a name=90:15></a>

However, I am disposed to include Dinah and Jacob, and leave out Er and Onan, and read thus: "These he the sons of Leah which she bare unto Jacob in Padan-Aram, with his daughter Dinah, all the souls of his sons and daughters; thirty and three." As if he had said, This makes thirty and three. If not, we must count in Er and Onan, and make it mere genealogical computation of sons, and verse 26 would be general, the computation already given excluding Jacob, and Joseph and his sons.

Thus, not only in the case of an evil report, Hotze Dibba, cited in the text; Deuteronomy 16: 23, bringing forth the tithe; Leviticus 24: 14, bringing forth him that had cursed; Zechariah 4: 7; Genesis 34: 24, 25, bringing forth Tamar; Exodus 3: 10, Moses is to bring forth Israel from Egypt, that is, cause them to come out. So Exodus 14: 13, Hebrews 14, So in Ezra 1: 8 we have, "those did Cyrus bring forth by the hand of Mithredath," where he expressly uses another to have them brought out.

		SCRIPTURE: THE PLACE IT HAS IN THIS DAY
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2 Timothy
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Allow me to say a few words to you, in which there will be nothing very new, on a subject on which simplicity and decision are of the utmost importance in these days.<a name=115:1></a> The Second Epistle to Timothy presents to us, as long ago observed, the ruin of the church in its earthly standing, and the heart of the apostle deeply affected by it, as would be the case, under the working of the Spirit of God, with one who had been God's instrument for founding it.<a name=115:2></a> It individualizes the duty of the Christian -- a momentous principle in these days when the church (so-called, really the clergy) renews the pretension to govern the conscience.<a name=115:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This epistle does not give us the church according to the purpose of God, and its full character in heavenly places (as in the Ephesians), nor is it the order of the church on earth (as in 1 Timothy); but we have in it life and salvation, now fully revealed in Christ (chapter 1: 1, 9, 10), but a piety which could be found in Jews as such, and in which Paul could speak of his forefathers.<a name=115:4></a> The church, indeed, is not mentioned at all.<a name=115:5></a> Not that the fellowship of saints is not noticed; it is expressly, but of those in whom purity of heart is known to exist, the testing of which was not known in the first beginning.<a name=115:6></a> Then those who came were received: only the Lord took care of the purity of the assembly, and manifested His own, adding to the church daily such as should be saved.<a name=115:7></a> Now He knew them that were His, and the responsibility rested on every one that named the name of the Lord to depart from iniquity; and the believer is to follow the path of peace and grace with those that call on the name of the Lord out of a pure heart.<a name=115:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Two points are brought before the believer here to guide his feet: his individual conduct, including his conduct as to other individuals; and his relationship to the public profession of Christianity in the world.<a name=115:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the first, he is, as I have said, to depart from iniquity.<a name=115:10></a> Such is the nature of Christianity, it cannot associate in walk with evil.<a name=115:11></a> He purges himself -- for it is individual duty -- from vessels to dishonour, which, in a great house, he expects to find.<a name=115:12></a> He seeks fellowship with those who join to a profession of Christ a pure heart, from which profession flows.<a name=115:13></a> On this, chapter 2 is as clear as possible.<a name=115:14></a> It is his individual responsibility; and it is important to take in both parts.<a name=115:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=116>[Page 116]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If the first part only is taken up (the departing from iniquity and purging from vessels to dishonour), the conscience may be upright; but a spirit of judgment and of self-righteousness will be engendered.<a name=116:1></a> If the latter only (to seek to walk with those pure in heart), without the former, conscience will be loose, and faithfulness to Christ, and obedience, more or less lost.<a name=116:2></a> The heart must be engaged in the love of God's people and fellowship with them, and the conscience be pure and faithful, as having done with evil, when evil is all around and allowed.<a name=116:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the second great point, our relationship to the public profession of Christianity in the world, chapter 3 gives equally clear direction.<a name=116:4></a> The peril of the last days is found in a form of godliness, denying the power of it.<a name=116:5></a> The direction is as simple as it is positive: "from such turn away.<a name=116:6></a>" Where form without power is, we are not to go, but, in a positive way, to turn away from it.<a name=116:7></a> But this would not, in itself, in the perilous times, be sufficient; for in the decay of practical piety and devotedness in the evangelical professing world many, whose principles are far more false, lead individually a life of great devotedness -- often, I allow, on false principles, yea, in themselves deadly principles -- but it is a sad snare when devotedness is found on the side of false doctrine, and worldliness with a greater degree of substantial truth.<a name=116:8></a> This is not the case, if the effect be taken as a whole; far from it; but individual cases, and the fire of first impressions, produce enough to make the devotedness of individuals a snare, leading men to receive false doctrine and to fall into Satan's hands (for so it really is), when the devotedness is founded on a real denial of grace and truth of the gospel, as Paul insists on it.<a name=116:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another point therefore is brought out here: the authority with which our souls are directly in communion, on which our conduct rests, the rule by which it is guided, and the application to the individual soul of that authority and rule.<a name=116:10></a> Is this mediate or immediate?<a name=116:11></a> Is it by the intervention of the church, as an authority between me and God?<a name=116:12></a> or is it the direct and immediate connection of my soul with God, and immediate subjection to His authority in His word?<a name=116:13></a> It is the latter, not the former.<a name=116:14></a> This is no rejection of ministry.<a name=116:15></a> If another knows the word better than myself -- has more spiritual power, he can help me; and this is according to the mind and will of God.<a name=116:16></a> But he does not come between my soul and the word, but brings me more fully into acquaintance with what God says to me in it.<a name=116:17></a> My soul is only the more in immediate relationship with God by His word.<a name=116:18></a> This only is the rule and measure of my responsibility, the expression of the authority of God over me.<a name=116:19></a> Another may be the means of my being more completely so; but he puts me thereby in immediate relationship to God by the word, more fully and more in detail, but does not take me out of the relationship.<a name=116:20></a> It remains immediate, as before, and there can be no other; it is direct with God; and God's title is absolute, and embraces the whole of my being in obedience.<a name=116:21></a> He exercises His authority immediately by the word.<a name=116:22></a> This may sanction, and does, duties towards others; but these are acknowledged by the authority of, and in obedience to, the word -- to God in His word.<a name=116:23></a> I am to fulfil every relationship in which God has placed me, but by and according to the word.<a name=116:24></a> My first, immediate, and all-ruling relationship is with God by the word.<a name=116:25></a> It has precedence of all others, rules in all others, and claims absolute and immediate subjection.<a name=116:26></a> "We ought to obey" is the Christian's ensign; but "we ought to obey God rather than men" is the absolute claim of God, who has revealed Himself fully, and reveals Himself immediately to us by the word.<a name=116:27></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The church may have -- has -- to be judged; the individual has to take notice of it -- is called on to do so, so that it cannot have authority over him as the ultimate rule for his soul.<a name=117:1></a> He is bound to take the word of God as the ultimate rule and norm of truth and conduct, having authority immediately from God over his soul, with nothing else between him and God.<a name=117:2></a> It is evident we are not here speaking of the discipline of an assembly exercised according to the word.<a name=117:3></a> That word which ordains it recognizes its validity, but what in religious, and indeed, in all matters, is the ultimate rule and authority.<a name=117:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another question apparently, but which is not really one, namely, Is the soul immediately cognisant of the word, and is it responsible to God for itself according to that authority?<a name=117:5></a> -- or can anything else come in between with authority, so that a soul is not immediately responsible to God according to that word?<a name=117:6></a> The only question really is -- Is God's word immediately addressed to the conscience of man, so as to hold him responsible when so addressed?<a name=117:7></a> No one in his senses would deny that if God revealed anything to a man, he ought to give heed to it.<a name=117:8></a> Infidelity may contest the fact that there is a word of God -- a ground which, in controversy, Roman Catholics generally take under the form of the question, "How do I know it is so?<a name=117:9></a>" I assume here there is a word of God.<a name=117:10></a> I inquire, is its authority immediate over my soul?<a name=117:11></a> -- or is anything, now I have it, between it and my soul?<a name=117:12></a> Is the authority of the oracles of God absolute, immediate?<a name=117:13></a> Do they bring me under an obligation which allows nothing to come between them and my soul, or to limit or modify their authority?<a name=117:14></a> I would remark, in passing, that save three Epistles, the writings of the New Testament (and, as far as the principle goes, the Old also) were addressed, not to the clergy (if we are so to call them), but by the clergy to the people.<a name=117:15></a> The claim of the clergy to possess them as such is sheer folly; they were specifically addressed to the Christian people by those commissioned of God to do it.<a name=117:16></a> This is undeniable.<a name=117:17></a> In one, Paul specially charges it to be read to all the holy brethren, and they very young Christians; 1 Thessalonians 5: 27.<a name=117:18></a> If professing Christians are so ignorant now that they cannot understand it, this is the effect of centuries of the church's teaching, but is no longer the case where there is lowliness and where the grace of God is looked to.<a name=117:19></a> "The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding to the simple.<a name=117:20></a>" "I am wiser than all my teachers," says David, "for thy law do I love.<a name=117:21></a>" "They shall be all taught of God" is the promise given to us.<a name=117:22></a>

		But my present object is less general than this, important as this truth may be.<a name=118:1></a> I speak of the instructions given by the apostle in Epistles, which were addressed to one in whom he had the greatest confidence as a servant and man of God, who had worked with him in the gospel, as a son with a father, and to whom he could reveal his inmost feelings, and could tell what was needed for the church when the evil days should come in; when the form of godliness, where the power was denied, forced on the conscience as duty the judgment of the state of the church -- wherein the apostle has revealed to us Christ's judgment, and called upon us to bow to and act upon it -- an epistle, in a word, which gives, not general truth and precious instruction to the Christian, but special guidance in the dangerous evils of the last days.<a name=118:2></a> This, with all church history before us, when subjection to the church was so long maintained, and darkness by it, and when the church (as Christ has loved, sanctifies, and will present it to Himself without spot and wrinkle) was so diligently and long confounded with the building of wood and hay and stubble, which had grown up, as they themselves admitted, into a large mixed worldly body, and that the church was as bad or worse than the world -- this revelation of the judgment of the church is of all importance.<a name=118:3></a> Diligently was it insisted on, as by Cyprian and sundry others, that the Holy Ghost was and could be nowhere else; that all outside the external form were lost.<a name=118:4></a> And so sternly was this held, that while the former confesses that the state of the church was disastrous (just what the world was, bishops and all, so that the worst persecution was only a light-needed chastisement), yet they insist that when any left it, pressed in conscience by its state, they left salvation and eternal life absolutely; there was no grace elsewhere.<a name=118:5></a><a href="#118:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>

		By this insisting on the privileges of an avowedly corrupt church too, souls who shrank from what was utter dishonour to Christ were left a prey to those who were really heretics or fanatics, when their consciences could no longer stand the moral state of the great outward body that held and claimed the place of the church of God.<a name=119:1></a> It is one of the sad parts of church history, the seeing how persons who left the public body when immorality and idolatry of the grossest kind were come in, often fell into the hands of, or were mixed up with, those whom Satan raised up to perplex and ruin the testimony of God.<a name=119:2></a> The primitive church never defended itself against the workings of heresy by the truth as they had it not (Irenaeus did so, perhaps a little), but by their own claims to possess all and their hereditary title to it: so even Irenaeus, Tertullian, Cyprian, and others.<a name=119:3></a> And those who made more allowance were themselves philosophers far from the truth, as Clemens Alexandrinus, and Origen.<a name=119:4></a> These did make a difference between some heretics and others; but, after that, schism or heresy were alike fatal:<a href="#119:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> and if afterwards a difference was made, none was made in denying salvation to them, or in burning them, when that became the fashion of the church.<a name=119:5></a>

		Now, with such a history before us, how immensely important is it to see that the individual is bound to judge the state of the professing church!<a name=120:1></a> At all times they were called on to recognize Christ's judgment of the state of the church, and be guided by the word as to it.<a name=120:2></a> They would have learned not to confound the body of Christ with the professing body.<a name=120:3></a><a href="#120:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> But in 2 Timothy 3 we are expressly called on to turn away from such as deny the power of godliness, though maintaining the form.<a name=120:4></a> But, if I am individually called upon to recognize and act on -- whatever that action may be -- the judgment of Christ as to the state of the church, then the church has ceased to be an authority, and is judged by the word, to which I am expressly called to give heed in that judgment; its judgment as a public body cannot be an authority governing my spiritual judgment, in which I am bound to follow the word, where it is itself judged in its mind and state.<a name=120:5></a> Christ expressly calls us individually to hear what the Spirit says to the churches; not what the church says, but what is said to them.<a name=120:6></a> I am not now saying what the consequence may be -- on that 2 Timothy 2 and 3 are clear -- but that the individual is called on to take heed to what Christ says as to the state of the church.<a name=120:7></a> It is not a thing to be overlooked that this first takes place in respect of Ephesus, where such blessing and knowledge of privilege was.<a name=120:8></a> The vessel of the highest grace, she represents the church's departure from its first estate, and receives the threat of the removal of the candlestick.<a name=120:9></a> But all I say now is: the individual is called upon as such to listen to Christ, and take notice of the judgment He forms of it.<a name=120:10></a> The church is a judged object, not an authority.<a name=120:11></a> The individual is bound to receive immediately from Christ or the Spirit by the word, what He says to him independent of the church's authority, yea, about the church itself.<a name=120:12></a> Yea, it is the proof that he has ears to hear, to hear Christ, to hear what the Spirit says.<a name=120:13></a> What, then, is the rule, when in professing Christendom there should be the form of godliness without the power, as certainly the apostle tells us would be the case in the perilous times in the last days, when Christians have to turn away from the form of godliness?<a name=120:14></a> We have it in a double form.<a name=120:15></a>

		The second authority referred to, which in part is the same, is the scriptures; but this has its special character.<a name=121:18></a> These are holy writings.<a name=121:19></a> God has provided that for His saints, which, with the key of faith in Christ Jesus, is a sure and certain guide -- a body of writings called by the apostle (that is, by divine authority) the holy scriptures, of which a child could be cognisant as such, guided by the piety of a mother -- and to be received as inspired and having divine authority, composed of a number of distinct writings, but forming a whole of which it could be said as a known whole, "the holy scriptures," and of each particular part, "every scripture," recognized in this way (in the most solemn manner by the Lord Himself, as well as by His apostle) as a whole, and as the inspired work of particular authors, and that as written documents, distinctively as such, and commanding faith as inspired.<a name=121:20></a> "Knowing this first," says Peter, "that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.<a name=121:21></a> For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man, but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.<a name=121:22></a>" "That it might be fulfilled," is the constant testimony of Matthew; or, more generally, "then was fulfilled.<a name=121:23></a>" "The scripture cannot be broken," says the Lord; "it is written in the prophets, They shall be all taught of God.<a name=121:24></a>" "If they believe not his writings, how shall they believe my words?<a name=121:25></a>" And in Gethsemane (Matthew 26: 56), contrasting their testimony "in the temple," but "that the scripture must be fulfilled.<a name=121:26></a>" So "then opened he their understandings, that they might understand the scripture," saying, "Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer.<a name=121:27></a>" And in that same journey, "Ought not Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory?<a name=121:28></a>" "And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.<a name=121:29></a>" It behoves, ought to be, since it was in the scripture.<a name=121:30></a> So Paul could say, "the scripture foreseeing .<a name=121:31></a>.<a name=121:32></a>.<a name=121:33></a> preached," because the mind of God was in it.<a name=121:34></a> So, as often remarked, the Lord quotes the Old Testament as a recognized whole, as used among the Jews, "Moses and the prophets and the psalms.<a name=121:35></a>" He used the scriptures, the written testimony, to silence the adversary, and referred to them, in rebuking the Jews, as one of a series of divine testimonies, which left them without excuse.<a name=121:36></a>

		Let us not forget, if the sense of the present state of things does not press upon us, that we know from scripture that those times were set in when John wrote and Paul wrote, and Peter and Jude.<a name=125:1></a> John could say, we know it is the last time: John could give the Lord's warning voice to the falling church in the seven churches of the Apocalypse; Peter could tell us that the time was come for judgment to begin at the house of God; Jude be forced to write to insist on the faith once delivered, because those had got into the church who will be the objects of Christ's judgment at the last day; Paul, that the mystery of iniquity already worked, and would do so till the lawless one was at last revealed after the falling away -- that already all sought their own, not the things of Jesus Christ.<a name=125:2></a> And he (though the wise architect to lay the foundation), when his departure was at hand, had to warn his beloved disciples, as he had the elders of Ephesus, of the evils at the door, and that evil men and seducers would wax worse and worse, and the church be a form of godliness without the power.<a name=125:3></a>

		Let me here engage my reader to realize in his own mind, and, if occasion call for it, insist with others on, the passage which connects itself closely with what we have considered -- I mean the passage in 1 John 2: 24, "Let that therefore abide in you which ye have heard from the beginning: if that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son and in the Father.<a name=126:1></a>" Nothing has secure authority for the believer but that which was from the beginning.<a name=126:2></a> This alone secures our continuing in the Father and the Son.<a name=126:3></a> There may be much respectable, much "reverend antiquity"; and the spirit of reverence, where the object is true, is a very important quality in the believer, but an amazing means of seduction when it is not.<a name=126:4></a> But, as a ground of faith, the Christian must have "what was from the beginning"; the authority for believing must be "that which existed from the beginning" -- must have been heard from the beginning.<a name=126:5></a> In the scriptures I have that certainty; I have the thing itself: nowhere else.<a name=126:6></a> Many may preach the truth and I profit by it; but by the word, specially here by the New Testament, I have the certainty of what was from the beginning, and I have it nowhere else.<a name=126:7></a> No agreement of Christians can give me this.<a name=126:8></a> If Rome and Greece and England were all one, their agreement would not give me what was from the beginning as a fact; the scriptures certainly do.<a name=126:9></a>

		I may be told that it is very presumptuous for me to set my judgment against such authority.<a name=126:10></a> I have no judgment of mine to set; I believe in what Paul and John and Peter and the blessed Lord said: there is no presumption in that.<a name=126:11></a> I do as they bid me, I receive and hold fast to what "was in the beginning.<a name=126:12></a>" If, indeed, any say that "it is not easy to understand," I ask, "Are they?<a name=126:13></a>" This is presumption -- to say they can teach the truth better than the apostles and the Lord, who spoke to the multitudes.<a name=126:14></a> At any rate I must have, not what the primitive church held, but "what was from the beginning.<a name=126:15></a>" Hence the same apostle says, "He that is of God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us: hereby know we the Spirit of truth and the spirit of error.<a name=126:16></a>"

		EITHER IN ADAM OR IN CHRIST?
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have thought, on weighing the request of some as to a paper on the great principles of our being dead and risen with Christ, that a review of the progressive character of the blessing connected in scripture with it might be profitable for all.<a name=134:1></a> I have not the expectation of satisfying myself in what I shall present; but, as my purpose is to follow scripture, I may be able perhaps in the Lord's goodness to help others.<a name=134:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are three great points to consider as regards sin (and I speak and purpose speaking entirely in a practical way): sins actually committed, involving us in guilt as regards deeds done in the body; the principle of sin as a law in our members, sin in the flesh; and separation from God.<a name=134:3></a> But in this last respect there are two aspects, separation of heart, and judicial separation.<a name=134:4></a> Both must be remedied.<a name=134:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The root of all sin is not in the lusts in which it is so hatefully shewn, but in having a will of our own, the departure of the will from God, the will to be independent, free to do our own will -- "who is Lord over us?<a name=134:6></a>" When we do thus separate from God, we must have something, we cannot suffice to ourselves, and we sink into lusts, lusts in which our will works.<a name=134:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is indeed another element which seems to me to have preceded both lust and will in man's fall, namely, distrust of God, which left him to the working of both.<a name=134:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Happy and confiding in God, he had no need to seek happiness in any other way; but Satan suggested to him that God had kept the forbidden fruit back from him, because if he ate it he would be as Elohim.<a name=134:9></a> Lust by this got entrance.<a name=134:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All this has to be remedied, and remedied according to the glory of God.<a name=134:11></a> Is that remedy a return to the old estate of man, a restoration or re-establishment of his original paradisaical state?<a name=134:12></a> is it that which is new -- new, that is, as regards man?<a name=134:13></a> The answer is simple: it is wholly new.<a name=134:14></a> It is blessing in a second Adam, who is the Lord from heaven.<a name=134:15></a> Man remains man, and the individual remains the individual; all their responsibility in their previous state recognized, and the glory of God provided for and vindicated as to it; but the state and blessing into which they are brought, as brought to God, is a wholly new one.<a name=134:16></a> It is God's way of doing this, and what He has done, which we are now to inquire into, according to the true and blessed word of God, who only can reveal these things.<a name=134:17></a>

		It may be well first to turn to the responsibility of man as such, though the thoughts and purposes of God preceded it all.<a name=135:1></a> But the revelation of them came after it, as we shall notice, with the Lord's help, farther on.<a name=135:2></a>

		Responsibility attaches to every creature who is placed in intelligent relationship with God.<a name=135:3></a> Wherever there is consciousness of such relationship, there is obligation to God in it.<a name=135:4></a> It may be in a holy nature, and obedience delighted in; in an innocent one, and little else but thankfulness known, save so far as we know it was in Adam, as obedience may be tested by commandment; or it may be in a state of sin, which does not alter the fact of relationship in which the fallen being stands, but his whole state is in such relative place.<a name=135:5></a> The first is the condition of the elect angels preserved by God, so that they have not left their first estate.<a name=135:6></a> The second was Adam's state before his fall.<a name=135:7></a> We may stay a moment to contemplate a state which passed away as if it were one intended only to give a lovely picture, that men might learn what it was, but incapable of lasting, the bright but peaceful freshness of morn for one who rises early to a busy and wearying day.<a name=135:8></a> Little is said of it, nothing of its joys.<a name=135:9></a> It was the true and real but transitory ushering in of that in which all moral truth has been brought out -- of a scene which results for faith in a head anointed with oil, and a cup running over, favour that is better than life, and dwelling in the house of the Lord for ever, our Father's house, but not in itself the green pastures and waters of quietness which are the natural effect of the hand and guidance of the Good Shepherd.<a name=135:10></a>

		The double effect of the work of our Lord Jesus Christ will be noticed here.<a name=144:10></a> There was, we have seen, responsibility to God on one side as born of Adam in the world, and God's purpose on the other, to bring us to glory and privilege in the second Adam.<a name=144:11></a> Christ has perfectly met one for us, and entered Himself, consequent on the work of redemption, into the other.<a name=144:12></a> He has glorified God as to the first Adam's state, but has died to it; not that He was ever in any of the sin of it, save as bearing it, but as with us here below as men, in like manner taking part of flesh and blood with the children in the likeness of sinful flesh, and made sin for us on the cross, when fully manifested as in that state knowing no sin.<a name=144:13></a> Now He is entered into the glory, the glory He had with the Father before the world was, as second Adam according to the purpose of God as to man, and according to righteousness; John 16, 17.<a name=144:14></a>

		I may add collaterally that, through far inferior and national, yet divinely given, joys and promises, this is true of Israel -- true, I mean, that the death of Christ has broken all relationship with God founded on flesh, or connected with their standing as heirs of promise as to it, though to secure them on a surer basis.<a name=147:1></a> He who was heir of the promises came, as a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made to the fathers.<a name=147:2></a> But if Israel in the flesh was naturally heir to them, Jews by nature, He laboured in vain, and spent His strength for nought and in vain.<a name=147:3></a> His people would have none of Him.<a name=147:4></a> The bill of their divorcement ran thus: "Wherefore, when I came, was there no man?<a name=147:5></a> when I called, was there none to answer?<a name=147:6></a>" Often would He, the Jehovah of Israel, have gathered Jerusalem's children, and they would not.<a name=147:7></a> If they had but even now known, in the day of their visitation, the things that belonged to their peace!<a name=147:8></a> but now they were hid from their eyes.<a name=147:9></a> Not only was Israel thus shut out according to their title to the promise, but the Messiah must give up, as thus come in the flesh, all that belonged to Him as so come in the flesh, though His work was perfect and with His God.<a name=147:10></a> He was cut off, and had nothing: so only it can really be translated.<a name=147:11></a> But this, by the depth of the riches of the wisdom of God, brought Israel, like the Gentiles, under pure mercy, as the apostle teaches us in Romans 11; and God, ever faithful to His promises, His gifts and calling, without repentance on His part, accomplishes them, but in pure grace, and yet in righteousness, through Christ's dying for that nation, and the mercies of David are assured in His resurrection from the dead.<a name=147:12></a> They indeed will enjoy the blessings of the new covenant and all their promises down here, but through Christ's death, and based on His resurrection.<a name=147:13></a> But, as in a deeper and more absolute work in us, their blessings are given with the complete setting aside of all their old standing under the old covenant in flesh, and founded anew on the cross and the resurrection of Christ.<a name=147:14></a> But this by the bye.<a name=147:15></a>

		Is this a theory that bears the impress of common sense?<a name=156:21></a> and what is it as concerns divine goodness?<a name=156:22></a> God desired to communicate to the world the mighty efficacy of the truth.<a name=156:23></a> He revealed that truth to chosen instruments; but the world, for whom He destined it, and His beloved church, could and can only receive it spoiled and marred by the weaknesses of the channels of communication, for whom personally it was not designed!<a name=156:24></a> And this is called rational!<a name=156:25></a> Nor is this all.<a name=156:26></a> The question becomes yet more serious, when the New Testament and more especially the Gospels are concerned, those given statements of events in which redemption was at least consummated, even though redemption be but the goal of the education of man.<a name=156:27></a> Manifestly this is of more importance than all besides.<a name=156:28></a> M.<a name=156:29></a> Godet speaks of it thus (page 43): "The contradictions between the Gospel recitals.<a name=156:30></a> But our Gospels, as we have seen, are not revelation.<a name=156:31></a> Revelation is the fact related -- it is Jesus, His work, His word.<a name=156:32></a> Our evangelists describe that fact to the best of their ability; one or two among them qualified from having been eye-witnesses, the others from such information as they were able to obtain.<a name=156:33></a>"

		But then, as regards the most important point, as regards redemption, there has been no revelation at all, because "revelation is a fact placed between God and His agent" (page 16), whilst our evangelists speak merely from their title of being eye-witnesses, or from such information as they were able to obtain.<a name=157:1></a> It is a matter of personal memory, and even of second-hand communication, since M.<a name=157:2></a> Godet relies on the legends of the primitive church, to which he often refers.<a name=157:3></a> Mark, for instance, according to M.<a name=157:4></a> Godet, has, at the request of the Roman Christians, given his own reminiscences of the remembrances of Peter.<a name=157:5></a> Matthew has "edited the discourses," but another has added the facts that link these discourses together as well as it could be done.<a name=157:6></a> Luke, having made use of documents already published, probably made some expeditions into Galilee during Paul's imprisonment at Caesarea, in order to collect together all the possible recollections which the memories of the Galileans could retain; and then from these materials Luke composed a history in the Grecian style, the only one which merited that name.<a name=157:7></a> (See "The origin of our four Gospels.<a name=157:8></a>" Biblical Studies: second series.<a name=157:9></a>)

		It is important that I should here point out a certain method of presenting inspiration (a method common to M.<a name=158:1></a> Godet and to all who oppose inspiration, but which serves to lead the simple astray).<a name=158:2></a> He speaks thus (Biblical Studies, page 48): "To require a Bible dictated word for word from heaven would be requiring a book that would supplant human thought instead of fertilizing it; a book making a passive instrument of man, instead of calling his intelligent and free co-operation into request .<a name=158:3></a>.<a name=158:4></a>.<a name=158:5></a> .<a name=158:6></a> Would that be more divine?<a name=158:7></a>" We must not expect M.<a name=158:8></a> Godet to agree with himself.<a name=158:9></a> At page 44 we read: "When it is granted to a man to confer directly with Jehovah, two things simultaneously take place in him.<a name=158:10></a> Every creature, himself included, disappears into nothingness.<a name=158:11></a> God remains before him as the Being who alone is great, alone real.<a name=158:12></a>" This has certainly some appearance of "supplanting human thought" -- has it not?<a name=158:13></a> Now, not being inspired myself, I do not intend to define inspiration; were I so, I do not imagine it would be possible for me to explain it to one who was not.<a name=158:14></a> What I seek is God's thought; I neither seek to "supplant" nor to "fertilize human thought.<a name=158:15></a>" But to define inspiration as being "word for word dictated from heaven," is but a human idea of the subject.<a name=158:16></a> When it has been written, "Thus saith Jehovah," or "Jehovah said unto Moses," either He has said it, or words have been put into the mouth of Jehovah, words which are not His own.<a name=158:17></a> God Himself makes a distinction in the form, but not in the authority of revelation; Numbers 12: 6-8.<a name=158:18></a> Tongues were spoken which the person who used them could not understand.<a name=158:19></a> This was truly "supplanting human thoughts"; but Paul preferred to speak with his understanding.<a name=158:20></a> God could fill his heart with glorious and holy thoughts, and so keep him filled with them that nothing should be there, and consequently nothing be expressed, but that which God had placed there.<a name=158:21></a> These were the thoughts of God, but through the power of the Spirit became the thoughts, the joy, of a man, creating in him an intelligence, moulding his heart and divinely enlightening his conscience.<a name=158:22></a> God could in such sort possess Himself of the intelligence, the heart, and the conscience, that nothing could either enter in or flow out but what He had put there.<a name=158:23></a> This is also the highest character of inspiration, because all that is revealed belongs to us; whereas the prophets, in searching into their own prophecies, found it was not for themselves they ministered those things.<a name=158:24></a> Be it as it may, is it not wretched in the extreme to put "a Bible dictated word for word from heaven" in contrast with human thought, instead of discerning the operation of the Spirit of God, and man's mind formed by the communication of purely divine thoughts, they being adapted to man, and also received by him through the work of the Spirit of God?<a name=158:25></a>

		It is of the utmost importance to notice that, in the rationalistic system which seeks to render an account of all by the circumstances of the writer, GOD AND THE OPERATION OF HIS SPIRIT ARE WHOLLY EXCLUDED.<a name=163:1></a> The facts may be important if they be correct; but the revelation of God upon earth in the Son of His love is left to such an appreciation as we may have of the uncertain rumours which were current in Galilee, or to the feebleness of the memories of fallible men.<a name=163:2></a> One need but read the Gospels to discern the divine traits that abound in them; but if we study them, we shall discover unity of purpose in each, and in all combined a fulness as to the Lord's Person, presenting of Him a complete idea and a perfect unity, thus affording an irrefragable testimony to the unity of the source whence all has flowed.<a name=163:3></a>

		Thus, in the four narratives of His death, we possess in each Gospel that which corresponds with its own special character, whilst all concur in presenting the Lord complete in the perfect unity of His Person -- all.<a name=163:4></a> As a divine Person in John, we have no sufferings in Gethsemane, nor on the cross.<a name=163:5></a> As Son of man in Luke, we have more of the agonies in Gethsemane, none upon the cross, but the triumph of His faith in His Father.<a name=163:6></a> As victim in Matthew, we see Him forsaken of God upon the cross, and find neither compassion nor anything except misery and malice in man, but Him perfect in all.<a name=163:7></a> Mark too much resembles Matthew for me to enter into further details now; but certainly he who is taught of God discerns in them all the divine description of the Son of God and Son of man, the Word made flesh -- Emmanuel -- Jesus, in His life and death described by One only -- by Him who is the Spirit of God, that God might be perfectly glorified.<a name=163:8></a>

		ON THE PUTTING AWAY OF SIN
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The question having been raised as to verse 26 of Hebrews 9 and the putting away of sin, I send you a few lines on this subject.<a name=181:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first place I have frequently insisted on sin being put away by the sacrifice of Christ, in the sense that the believer stands before God perfectly justified and accepted, the Lord imputing no sin; he is perfectly clear before God.<a name=181:2></a> And this, thank God, I believe as I ever did.<a name=181:3></a> It is our blessed privilege in Christ.<a name=181:4></a> May every quickened soul enjoy it!<a name=181:5></a> God forbid that any nicety of expression should enfeeble it.<a name=181:6></a> But when expressions, not actually the word of God, are used, and conclusions are drawn from them, as if they were scriptural statements, we are forced to be more accurate.<a name=181:7></a> And this has been the case in the statement that sin has been put away by the sacrifice of Christ.<a name=181:8></a> This scripture does not state.<a name=181:9></a> He appeared once, in the consummation of ages, for the putting away of sin <i>(eis athetesin)</i> by the sacrifice of Himself.<a name=181:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I had long ago noticed that the expression, "the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world," would have its perfect completion only in the new heaven and the new earth, though the work on which that state was based was finished by God's Lamb once for all on the cross; but the force of Hebrews 9: 26 had not been so especially noted.<a name=181:11></a> Yet it is essentially the same truth.<a name=181:12></a> Sin, that hated thing, must be put out of that world which God created for His own glory.<a name=181:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We must not confound clearing our conscience and redeeming us, and putting away sin out of God's world as that which is offensive to Him.<a name=181:14></a> Verse 28 speaks of Christ's bearing the sins of many.<a name=181:15></a> Thus they are perfectly cleared.<a name=181:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But sin remains in the flesh and in the world, and it must be set aside, all things in heaven and earth reconciled to God; and this will take place.<a name=181:17></a> The work on which it is based, in virtue of which it will be accomplished by power, the work in which God is morally glorified perfectly and for ever, is accomplished, and Christ sits at the right hand of God in virtue of it.<a name=181:18></a> But the sins of the many who come under grace have been borne by Him, and the believer has been washed from all.<a name=181:19></a> Nor is this all as to him.<a name=181:20></a> Not only has Christ borne all his sins, but for faith he has died with Christ, and as dead he is justified from sin; the old man has been crucified with Christ.<a name=181:21></a> Sin in the flesh was condemned on the cross, and there is no condemnation for him.<a name=181:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=182>[Page 182]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is in this general sense of our standing before God that it has been said that sin was put away, and, thank God, it is so.<a name=182:1></a> But the real thought was all guilt and imputation in our standing before God.<a name=182:2></a> But the putting away sin has a wider application in scripture; all things in heaven and earth are to be reconciled to God.<a name=182:3></a> Righteousness is to dwell in the new heaven and the new earth, and in a modified sense this will be the case even in the reign of Christ.<a name=182:4></a> Then it will be effected by power.<a name=182:5></a> But the work by which morally that is done in righteousness and for God's glory, in which it is really done in the moral sense, is accomplished, all that God is having been glorified on the cross where Christ was made sin; and faith lays hold on this.<a name=182:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Alas!<a name=182:7></a> very few Christians even make the difference of <i>sins</i> or guilt, and <i>sin</i>.<a name=182:8></a> Our sins are all forgiven, we are perfectly washed from them; and, besides this, as dead with Christ, the old man is for faith put off; its condemnation was in Christ's death.<a name=182:9></a> We are not in the flesh, though actually the flesh is in us.<a name=182:10></a> But the putting away of sin goes far wider, the putting it away out of God's sight in the world.<a name=182:11></a> And this, as a result, is not accomplished, though the work be perfectly accomplished on which that result is founded, and that work is in one sense more important than the fact, because God has been perfectly glorified there, in virtue of which it will be accomplished; and faith knows this work is done, and rejoices that there is no condemnation for the believer before God, the conscience being purged from sins, and sin in the flesh being condemned in the cross.<a name=182:12></a> So that there is no imputation and no condemnation.<a name=182:13></a> But sin exists.<a name=182:14></a> The effect of the work, as in God's purpose, is not as yet made good.<a name=182:15></a> Even as to the believer, he cannot say, I have no sin.<a name=182:16></a> "He that is dead is justified from sin" (not sins) here; but I have this title to reckon myself dead, Christ having died to sin.<a name=182:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If I say sin is put away, I weaken the force of "putting away," for sin is still there.<a name=182:18></a> It is not the world in which righteousness dwells.<a name=182:19></a> The sins of God's people have been borne, and the blood of propitiation is on the mercy-seat; so that we can go to the world and beseech sinners to come, as though God did beseech by us, in our little measure.<a name=182:20></a> That work is all done and accepted which enables me to do it.<a name=182:21></a> I can say to the believer that he is all clear, white as snow before God.<a name=182:22></a> But the putting away of sin is a wider thing.<a name=182:23></a> John 1 itself shews this -- the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (not has taken away, nor sins).<a name=182:24></a> It is the removal of sin in God's sight in the world, a result not yet accomplished.<a name=182:25></a> This passage refers specifically to the result, Hebrews 9: 26 to the purpose and means of its being done, as verse 28 does to the other question of our actual guilt.<a name=182:26></a>

		REVIEW OF R. PEARSALL SMITH ON "HOLINESS THROUGH FAITH"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My Dear Brother, -- <br>I do not question the sincerity or devotedness of the writer of the book which has been before us; but it has only led me to reject wholly its statements as incorrect, and I must add mischievous, and the rather because it is a perversion of what I believe to be one of the most imperious necessities of the church of God -- "the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free.<a name=184:1></a>" You know that I reject the thought (I have done so for five and forty years) of the experience of Romans 7 being a Christian state.<a name=184:2></a> It is the state of a regenerate soul under law, under the "first husband" of the chapter; not the delivered soul under the second husband, that is, Christ risen.<a name=184:3></a> But this is confounded by the writer with a state of purity on, I judge, a low scale compared with the statements of scripture: and there is consequently such vagueness, want of knowledge of scriptural truth, and contradiction in the book, that it is hard to deal with.<a name=184:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I confess, too, the effort does not attract me.<a name=184:5></a> That a man must realise this liberty, must possess it, before he can press its blessedness on others, is quite true; but it is not therefore necessary that one should always speak of such realisation in one's self.<a name=184:6></a> It makes a subtle self dominant, which lowers the spiritual state.<a name=184:7></a> I never saw any one make his experience the object of his mind, or that with which his mind was occupied, that it did not make self a great object to self.<a name=184:8></a> Whether the experience was ordinary evangelical experience, Romans 7, Galatians 5: 17, or that of the perfectionist, self holds a large place in the mind's eye; and it cannot be otherwise.<a name=184:9></a> And I think this book is a clear example of it.<a name=184:10></a> The blessedness and beauty of Christ Himself nowhere appear in it.<a name=184:11></a> He tells us that this doctrine makes more of Christ, and ourselves humble; but if you examine it, it is what Christ effects and produces in us, not what Christ is.<a name=184:12></a> And this makes all the difference.<a name=184:13></a> What distinguishes, according to John, "the fathers in Christ" is "ye have known Him that is from the beginning.<a name=184:14></a>" It is all John has to say of them, but it is much and blessed.<a name=184:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe in deliverance.<a name=184:16></a> I believe in the unclouded enjoyment of that favour which is better than life, living in the consciousness that we are loved as Jesus was loved, knowing the love of Christ which passeth knowledge.<a name=184:17></a> I would insist on it.<a name=184:18></a> It is a chief grief for me as regards the church of God that they are as persons outside, at best hoping; not inside, entered through the rent veil, abiding in the light of God's countenance and looking at Christ and His cross in its own divine perfectness with the eye that the Holy Ghost gives.<a name=184:19></a> This I repeat is my daily (might I not say hourly?<a name=184:20></a>) grief.<a name=184:21></a>

		But I say that, where the soul is thus in free and blessed fellowship with the Father's love and Jesus, it is occupied with them -- with the unsearchable fulness of Christ; and that, when it has to be occupied with itself, it has to judge itself.<a name=185:1></a> That happens, though there be no excuse for it.<a name=185:2></a> But this will be self-judgment, not a reflective sense of one's own perfectness; that is never right.<a name=185:3></a> But this is the contents of, and what is urged in, <i>Holiness through Faith</i>.<a name=185:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ is the power to make us perfect and holy: not the all-blessing object of a holy soul that does not think of itself but of Himself.<a name=185:5></a> And the difference is very real and all-important, and scripture is quite clear on the subject.<a name=185:6></a> No attained state can possibly have the perfectness which is in Christ, nor even any perfecting influence, as thinking of Him has.<a name=185:7></a> I am thinking of self.<a name=185:8></a> It is because it falsifies and perverts the truth of deliverance that I object to this book, not because there is not the deliverance revealed to us in the scriptures.<a name=185:9></a> Hence I do not the least deny, nor do I desire to deny, the instances he gives of deliverance; but I wholly deny his interpretation and spiritual estimate of them; and (though surely deliverance is by faith, as every good thing is, and souls may have been delivered; and though experiences may vary according to the state of the soul, the wisdom of God who deigns to think of each particular case, and the knowledge of grace and truth), yet none ever get out of Romans 7 who had not been in it.<a name=185:10></a> There must be self-knowledge, which is what is found in Romans 7, and is always really found under law, and, as Mr.<a name=185:11></a> Smith admits, deliverance is found when a man despairs of self.<a name=185:12></a> But this is experience.<a name=185:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Divine grace sets us free when we know we are bound and have no power.<a name=185:14></a> But we do not know liberty when we have not found this out.<a name=185:15></a> Deliverance there is, which many deny, but deliverance from what is experimentally known and felt as bondage to be delivered from.<a name=185:16></a> And if Mr.<a name=185:17></a> Smith were to speak of this holy state of deliverance from sin to a man who had gone through this lesson, he would speak to the wind or delude the one he spoke to.<a name=185:18></a> In the instances given, those at least which are not too vague to build on, this lesson had been learnt, and I dare say the deliverance was very real.<a name=185:19></a> But Mr.<a name=185:20></a> Smith's conclusions from them are false.<a name=185:21></a> He confounds deliverance and purity and holiness as one thing, and, though not nominally on Wesleyan grounds and admitting the existence of flesh or sin in us,<a href="#185:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> yet he makes confusion of the whole subject by not taking scriptural statements as to it, or by misrepresenting scripture, which he largely does; and, by not looking at a glorified Christ as that on which the eye of faith is fixed, he lowers the whole Christian condition.<a name=185:22></a> This last point probes the whole statement, and shews not that deliverance is false, but that his view of it and confusion of it with purity as the same thought is false.<a name=185:23></a> There are after all a great many remains of Wesleyan error.<a name=185:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="footnote">

	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thing that has misled Mr.<a name=186:1></a> Smith is that he has made the common experience of undelivered souls his only standard of comparison, so as to set up the state he pleads for -- not scripture and Christ as his standard of comparison and judgment.<a name=186:2></a> This leaves all really in the dark.<a name=186:3></a> He can easily shew that the state of most Christians is not all that scripture gives; but another question arises: Is <i>his</i> state, and what he pleads for, what scripture gives?<a name=186:4></a> I affirm it is not; and his book, however well intended, is mischievous, because it puts what is greatly to be desired on false and unscriptural ground.<a name=186:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My part, then, is to compare his views with scripture.<a name=186:6></a> On deliverance from Romans 7 I should insist earnestly.<a name=186:7></a> I turn to the examination of his book.<a name=186:8></a> He begins by an appeal to the experience of those not set free, and asks if their expectations at conversion have been practically realised.<a name=186:9></a> My answer is: Infinitely and beyond all comparison more than realised.<a name=186:10></a> But, it may be remarked, nothing is spoken of but our own estimate of our own state; and moreover the appeal is to shame as to it before others, not the sense of sin.<a name=186:11></a> He then presses that the man loves sin still.<a name=186:12></a> Now this is not even Romans 7.<a name=186:13></a> There the person hated evil; his grief was that, though he really hated it, it still got power over him.<a name=186:14></a> Mr.<a name=186:15></a> Smith's way of putting it is false altogether; nor are flesh and the new man distinguished.<a name=186:16></a> This is seen really all through the book.<a name=186:17></a> "His affections shew the central powers of his being.<a name=186:18></a>" Now this is totally false, and contradicts Romans 7, the idea of being born of God, and all the teaching of scripture.<a name=186:19></a>

		One born of God surely hates sin at the bottom of his heart, however he may lack power or deliverance.<a name=187:1></a> It is because he hates sin that it makes him miserable; and justly too.<a name=187:2></a> "Sweet water and bitter" is a false use of James, who is speaking of what comes out of the person as "cursing man and blessing God," and denounces it, but has nothing to do with the inward experience of a soul.<a name=187:3></a> The man in James may be a fully delivered soul if he has got careless.<a name=187:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards what is said in page 3, no doubt victory over sin is desired; but what does this mean?<a name=187:5></a> It is very difficult to know in this book what the writer means -- he so contradicts himself and neglects scripture.<a name=187:6></a> Is it sin which is there over which victory is sought, or is it deliverance from it so that it is not there?<a name=187:7></a> Indeed on pages 71, 72 this is all carefully thrown into confusion, to the hiding of scriptural truth in a way to deceive souls sadly.<a name=187:8></a> But the passage itself (page 3) gives the wishes and motives of a tried soul as the measure of what we are to have, not scripture.<a name=187:9></a> It is trying, too, how (as page 9) he continually quotes Peter -- "dead to sins"; and once, perhaps, refers to being "dead to sin," which is the real question.<a name=187:10></a> Nor is "dead" the same word in the original, in the two cases.<a name=187:11></a> In Peter it is <i>apogenomenoi</i>, a very different word from that in Romans 6, as indeed the whole thought is.<a name=187:12></a> But Romans 6 is the doctrine of deliverance from Romans 7.<a name=187:13></a> Now it is just on this point, though differing from them as to flesh and a new nature, he gets on to Wesleyan ground; that is, while the definition of sin is left vague (pages 71-72), that sins and sin in the flesh may be huddled into one thought; that is, Wesley's definition of sin -- a voluntary, or, according to R.<a name=187:14></a>P.<a name=187:15></a>S.<a name=187:16></a>, a conscious transgression of a known law -- and the evil nature which gives birth to lust, of which Paul speaks.<a name=187:17></a> Now the confounding of these mitigates the idea of sin, and the real point of the teachings in Romans 6-8 is wholly lost, and a great deal more with it.<a name=187:18></a> Paul will have death to sin, not merely being done with sins, however completely.<a name=187:19></a> Nor is deliverance otherwise taught.<a name=187:20></a> Such a system leaves the evil unreached, as we shall see it does the result and object too.<a name=187:21></a>

		Next I find on page 12: "That we might be holy and pure, and conformed to the image of Jesus Christ.<a name=188:1></a>" Now; first of all, we see here the importance of the confusion between victory and purity, and the vagueness of Mr.<a name=188:2></a> Smith's statement.<a name=188:3></a> Had Christ to gain victory or be victorious over sin in the flesh?<a name=188:4></a> The thought were blasphemy!<a name=188:5></a> Victory, and holy and pure, are different things.<a name=188:6></a> "Holy and pure" means that there is no sin to have victory over, and that was Christ's state: victory over sin was not His portion.<a name=188:7></a> We are never called to be what Christ was consequently; for there was no sin in Him.<a name=188:8></a> We are to <i>walk</i> as He walked; for if sin be in me, if the flesh be still there, there is no reason why I should walk after it; no, nor think after it.<a name=188:9></a> This I fully hold.<a name=188:10></a> It never should be the source of a thought in me.<a name=188:11></a> I should walk in the Spirit.<a name=188:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the Philippians, where <i>Christian</i> experience is found as exhibited in the apostle, the word sin does not occur.<a name=188:13></a> Yet Paul had a thorn in the flesh to buffet him, and needed it.<a name=188:14></a> Did Christ?<a name=188:15></a> The thorn hindered the action of Paul's flesh, a great and sovereign mercy.<a name=188:16></a> The existence of sin in the flesh does not give a bad conscience; the allowance of it does, and consequently hinders the fellowship with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ; for then coming into the light makes conscience active to judge -- thank God it does -- instead of filling the heart with joy because we are with God.<a name=188:17></a> A person who prayed to be conformed to Jesus Christ (not if he prayed to <i>walk</i> as He walked, and even have His mind), that is, to be what He was, would prove his ignorance of himself as to the flesh, and of Christ too.<a name=188:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But, further, the passage alluded to is wholly misapplied.<a name=188:19></a> Conformity to the image of God's Son is in glory, and there is for the Christian no perfection at all but that.<a name=188:20></a> The view then scripture gives of conformity to Christ is far different from that which this book so carelessly gives.<a name=188:21></a> We are to bear the image of the heavenly as we have borne the image of the earthly.<a name=188:22></a> The standard of conformity to Christ is quite different from that of this book, and this is evidently of all importance on the subject we are upon, and the consequences will be immediately seen.<a name=188:23></a> "Now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is; and he that hath this hope in Him purifieth himself as He is pure.<a name=188:24></a>"

		I do not think that talking of the Spirit rushing in when there is a vacuum is worthy of the exercises of a soul before God, nor of the ways of God in grace, of the seriousness that befits the question of the salvation of a sinful soul; but I should have taken no notice of it, had it not been an unsound thought.<a name=205:8></a> Neither is there any vacuum, nor anything to form it, nor any rushing in of the Spirit.<a name=205:9></a> The work of the Spirit in leading to deliverance is the opposite of a vacuum.<a name=205:10></a> It fills the soul with the honest and upright, but deep and bitter, sense of the power of sin in us, and our incapacity for gaining the victory over it.<a name=205:11></a> The law -- and in this case we are practically under law -- gives no life, no power, no object.<a name=205:12></a> It requires very rightly that lust should not be there; and lust is there and leads me captive, and I find I cannot get rid of it.<a name=205:13></a>

		The soul is full of sin, though hating it, and of bitterness as it never was before, and is broken down in the sense of its wretchedness; but this in itself is not power -- any more than the thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan, was power; but through grace it makes us find out we have none, and casts us on Another -- "who shall deliver me?<a name=205:14></a>" -- and then, as has been said, we find through divine teaching that God sees us as having died in Christ.<a name=205:15></a> The abiding power of deliverance and liberty -- true heavenly liberty -- is the law (that is, the abidingly active power) of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus.<a name=205:16></a> but though it may be possible that in some instances God may grant the faith of it in reply to the earnest cry of the oppressed soul (often dangerous, as leading the soul to think of what passes in itself<a href="#205:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>), the scripture account of deliverance is not redemption which takes place in our own souls then, but the divinely given understanding that God condemned sin in the flesh when Christ was a sacrifice for sin.<a name=205:17></a> We, as men in the flesh, were crucified with Him then.<a name=205:18></a>

		And this leads me to another capital point.<a name=208:20></a> Romans 6 has nothing to do with experience, but states the ground on which <i>every</i> Christian stands.<a name=208:21></a> Deliverance, which Mr.<a name=208:22></a> S.<a name=208:23></a> makes no matter of effort of, but jumping into holiness by faith, is the result of the painful and humbling but most profitable discovery that we cannot gain victory over sin in the flesh, even when born again.<a name=208:24></a> There is deliverance, not pardon, from its power and dominion, when knowledge of <i>self is</i> experimentally gained.<a name=208:25></a> Romans 6 calls upon us to reckon ourselves dead, but does not teach us that we die by any present experience.<a name=208:26></a> This scripture never teaches, but that the Christian was crucified with Christ; it is the judicial state of every Christian, of everyone baptized unto (not <i>into</i>) Christ.<a name=208:27></a> There is no union by faith, or experience, or anything else in the chapter, but doctrine and exhortation.<a name=208:28></a> The Christ we have been baptized unto is One who having died, we are accounted by baptism to take part in His death; it is that to which we come by profession in being a Christian; and the ground of the reasoning shews the absurdity of Mr.<a name=208:29></a> S.<a name=208:30></a>'s view of the chapter, as do its contents.<a name=208:31></a> If one Man's obedience made me righteous, I may live on in sin, say the flesh and the world.<a name=208:32></a> But, says the apostle, you have a part in that by having a part in death with Christ; consequently, it is the opposite to living on in sin.<a name=208:33></a>

		The doctrine of the chapter is perfectly plain.<a name=209:1></a> Whoever has been baptized to Christ has been baptized to His death.<a name=209:2></a> It is the force of the Christian profession, "Knowing this, that our old man is [has been] crucified with Him that the body of sin might be destroyed"; that was the object, so that henceforth we should not serve sin.<a name=209:3></a> The apostle carefully avoids, or rather repudiates, speaking of sin not existing in us; one would have thought the destruction of the whole body of sin in its entirety would have induced its non-existence in us.<a name=209:4></a> Not so; it is a practical conclusion he draws, that henceforth we should not serve it.<a name=209:5></a> So we are exhorted to walk in newness of life.<a name=209:6></a> Mr.<a name=209:7></a> S.<a name=209:8></a> will insist on this being realized by experience.<a name=209:9></a> Be it so: I cordially accept it; but it is no experience of some work wrought in us at a given moment by which and when we were crucified.<a name=209:10></a> There is a work wrought in us; but it is the teaching us to know that the old man was crucified with Christ, <i>not</i> that it has happened at a given moment by a work in us.<a name=209:11></a> We are called to reckon ourselves dead, because we were crucified with Christ, and this makes practically all the difference; the mind is not occupied with a petty exaggerated work in us, but with the absoluteness of Christ's cross, and in Another, which hinders our being occupied with self, as is invariably the case in Mr.<a name=209:12></a> S.<a name=209:13></a>'s system.<a name=209:14></a> I do not charge him in particular; it is the invariable and necessary consequence of the system.<a name=209:15></a>

		LETTER ON MR. J.P.S.S "HOLINESS THROUGH FAITH"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My Dear -- , <br>The greater part of what is here, even to its terminology, is borrowed from so-called "Brethren," such as resurrection-life, etc.<a name=212:1></a> I do not mean by this, that it is not sincere or real, for I have no such thought, but that it is what you have known and received for years.<a name=212:2></a> You must be aware that the teaching that Romans 7 is not the Christian state, but that chapter 8 is, has been taught, as I have myself earnestly insisted on it now near fifty years, only I trust with increasing clearness.<a name=212:3></a> But what is added to it is not sound teaching, and lowers the standard which scripture presents to us, and tends to put estimate of self instead of thoughts of Christ.<a name=212:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Mr.<a name=212:5></a> S.<a name=212:6></a> does see liberty before God and from sin which is by faith, though not scriptural on this point either, as we shall see; but he compares a Christian state with those who are under the bondage of the law, or Romans 8, instead of comparing it with Christ glorified or down here, and hence falsifies that state as well as lowers the standard.<a name=212:7></a> Being free from the law of sin and death, filled with the Spirit, dead to sin, are to be pressed as the only right state of the Christian.<a name=212:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The question of the justness of the statement of this book does not lie there.<a name=212:9></a> It confounds this with a supposed state of purity, which is not the scriptural apprehension of the Christian's condition when free.<a name=212:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I find in the very outset a mis-statement which affects the whole book.<a name=212:11></a> It is said (page 12), "If we give rein to our yearnings, asking of God whatsoever things we desire, what would be our first instinctive cry?<a name=212:12></a> That we might be holy and pure, and conformed to the image of Jesus Christ.<a name=212:13></a>" Now while this sounds very well, and the desire after holiness is an essential part of the new man, yet this statement is not scriptural, and falsifies the whole truth on the subject.<a name=212:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Conformity to the image of Jesus Christ is in glory.<a name=212:15></a> We are predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He may be the firstborn among many brethren.<a name=212:16></a> We have borne the image of the earthly, and we shall bear the image of the heavenly.<a name=212:17></a> The only positive object of the Christian is conformity to Christ in glory.<a name=212:18></a> And we know that when He shall appear we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is.<a name=212:19></a>

		And now mark the difference of the consequence.<a name=213:1></a> For Mr.<a name=213:2></a> page S.<a name=213:3></a> it is to be holy and pure, etc.<a name=213:4></a> For scriptural conformity to Christ is in glory, and the consequence is, "He that hath this hope in him purifieth himself as he is pure.<a name=213:5></a>" The standard is Christ in glory, and it is not said pure, but "purifieth.<a name=213:6></a>" This is always the scriptural estimate.<a name=213:7></a> "Beholding with unveiled face [looking fully into] the glory of the Lord, we are changed into the same image from glory to glory as by the Spirit of the Lord.<a name=213:8></a>" Hence Paul, in his fullest energy, seeks to win Christ, and along with this that he may attain unto the resurrection from among the dead.<a name=213:9></a> His object is the prize of the high calling, his calling is up above <i>(ano)</i>.<a name=213:10></a> No state here is the object of the Christian.<a name=213:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this alters the whole character of Christian state and attainment.<a name=213:12></a> For this Christ's state down here is never presented as a model of attainment, for He was wholly without sin, and we are not in nature.<a name=213:13></a> Scripture says "he that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk as he walked.<a name=213:14></a>" Because we ought never to walk after the flesh, though the flesh be there.<a name=213:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		No one desires that any should live in sin, or even sin at all.<a name=213:16></a> We have no excuse for a single idle thought, for Christ's grace is sufficient for us, and God is faithful not to suffer us to be tempted above that we are able.<a name=213:17></a> But in Romans 6 it is not Christ's walk down here or state which is presented, but His being raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, and our consequent walking in newness of life.<a name=213:18></a> Here Mr.<a name=213:19></a> S.<a name=213:20></a> makes it the point of his argument (page 15) that we are not to serve sin.<a name=213:21></a> Of course we are not.<a name=213:22></a> But his argument here is all fallacious.<a name=213:23></a> What is stated is urged as the only normal Christian state.<a name=213:24></a> But the ground of the argument is that we (believers) were crucified with Christ: that is, when He was crucified, we were.<a name=213:25></a> Now it is of course faith that realizes this through grace, and if we do we are free: but the thing realized is, that we were crucified with Him when He was crucified.<a name=213:26></a> And it is so taken as the Christian state that the introduction to Christianity (baptism) is the introduction to that as its proper force; being baptized to Christ is being baptized to His death; and this, not the question of guilt and sins put away (that subject is treated to the end of verse 11, chapter 5), but our state and our relationship to God by Adam's sin, to which state we have died, and so are clear from it and out of it, Christ having actually died for us to this as well as borne our sins.<a name=213:27></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But as this is a state of dependence, diligent seeking of grace alone can keep us thus, and in fact in many things we all offend.<a name=222:12></a> But my normal state is not grieving the Spirit, and so in God's presence, being able to think of Him and not of self.<a name=222:13></a> No state here is the object of the saint.<a name=222:14></a> He is not alive in the world, and he looks, having this life, to be conformed to Christ in glory, and if he thinks of himself at all, it is only to judge himself.<a name=222:15></a> But I believe -- in complete deliverance from the law of sin which is in our members -- that I am called to be filled with the Spirit, which would not allow thoughts from the flesh to arise in the mind, nor anything that would soil the conscience, but would make us live in the atmosphere of the divine presence.<a name=222:16></a> The practical realizing of this is by always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus; and thus God helps us by delivering us to death by trial that this may be fully made good; 2 Corinthians 4.<a name=222:17></a>

		I allow therefore no captivity to sin, no dominion of it.<a name=223:1></a> This, even when hopeless as to getting the victory, we find to be ours in Christ; and there all has to come from the Spirit, and all is fulness of joy with God.<a name=223:2></a> But this is carried out first by knowing, when hopeless as to victory over the flesh, that we have died in Christ, and then by always bearing about His dying, death still working in us, that the life only of Christ may be manifested.<a name=223:3></a>

		But there is complete deliverance from the whole power of sin, we reckoning ourselves dead, and undistracted enjoyment of divine favour in the relationship in which Christ is.<a name=223:6></a> The only normal state of the Christian then is unclouded fellowship with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ, and the uninterrupted manifestation of the life of Christ in his body, and (when in God's presence) not having to think of sin in himself, but freedom to think of God and what He is.<a name=223:7></a> He is divinely free through and in Christ.<a name=223:8></a> But he has no thought of a present state of perfection or of purity (only the Spirit is ungrieved and has not to make him think of himself); for his only owned state is conformity to Christ in glory, God having wrought him for that selfsame thing, in virtue of which he purifies himself as He is pure; and if he does think of himself, he has the consciousness of his not being like Christ as he would, but is glad to have to think of Christ only.<a name=223:9></a> But purifying himself is not consciousness that he is pure.<a name=223:10></a> His conversation is in heaven, his motives there, and hence necessarily, if he thinks of himself, the consciousness of shortcoming, though he be not troubled by any present thought of sin, but is able to think of Christ.<a name=223:11></a> A return to think of himself is for him already failure.<a name=223:12></a>

		THE EFFECT SPIRITUALLY OF "HOLINESS THROUGH FAITH"

		BRIEF REMARKS ON "AN ADDRESS FOR THE PROMOTION OF SCRIPTURAL HOLINESS"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		["The Southern Ohio Association for the Promotion of Scriptural Holiness does not believe, nor teach, that either by nature or through imparted grace can an absolutely sinless life be realized on earth.<a name=227:1></a> Whether tried by the commandment of God, which is 'exceeding broad,' or the example of the Lord Jesus Christ, the most holy human being is, through infirmity, ignorance, and faulty judgment, in God's sight, found full of short-comings and imperfections, and constantly needing the application of the cleansing blood.<a name=227:2></a> Neither do we believe that mortals ever attain to a position beyond which there is no progress or improvement, for we are taught that even after the redeemed come to 'a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ,' they have yet to 'grow up into him in all things which is the head, even Christ' (Ephesians 4: 13, 15), and will evermore be 'pressing forward to the mark,' and, beholding the glory of the Lord, be 'changed into the same image from glory to glory.<a name=227:3></a>'
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"We accordingly declare that the names and phrases current in connection with our work, such as the higher Christian life, entire sanctification, perfect love, full salvation, Christian perfection, and the like, are not used in any opposite or contrary sense, but as having a meaning consistent with the truth we have just affirmed.<a name=227:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"This much being said to remove misapprehension and prejudice, we proceed to say that we do hold, and endeavour in humility and love to teach, that there is to be found in the Lord Jesus Christ habitual victory over known sin; whether in the grosser forms, which men can see in one another, or in the more subtle shapes of pride, envy, discontent, ambition, covetousness, animosity, or selfishness, which may be known only to ourselves and to God; that it is the privilege (and therefore the duty) of each Christian to say with Paul, 'I know nothing against myself' (1 Corinthians 4: 4), and of all of us, to be able with him to call God and all who see us to witness how 'holily, justly, and unblameably we behave ourselves among them that believe'; with Enoch to have the testimony that we 'please God'; with John to have an uncondemning heart; and with Peter, and the Gentiles to whom he preached, to rejoice in the possession of a pure heart, created through faith by the 'falling' of the Holy Ghost.<a name=227:5></a> (Acts 10: 44; chapter 11: 15; chapter 15: 8, 9.<a name=227:6></a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"The particular proposition which we all, without regard to denominational connection, unite in affirming, is a definite and distinct work of the Spirit in the human soul, subsequent and in addition to regeneration or conversion.<a name=227:7></a> 'The promise of the Father,' which came upon the disciples at Pentecost, had been spoken of by the Lord Jesus in such terms as shew unmistakably that it was for every one who would keep His words (John 14: 16-23), and Peter, in explaining the Pentecostal baptism to the wondering multitudes, declared that they also might receive the same, and that the promise was to them and their children, and 'to all that were afar off, even as many as the Lord our God should call.<a name=227:8></a>' The apostles were converted before this; they knew the Spirit (John 14: 17), and the 'gift of the Holy Ghost' was an additional privilege and blessing, given of God to be the distinguishing characteristic of Christian experience during the dispensation which then began (John 7: 39), and continues until now.<a name=227:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Many of us believe that we find this truth taught in the scriptures, not merely as the baptism of the Holy Ghost, or the coming of the Comforter, but also as the revealing of the Son in us (Galatians 3: 26; chapter 4: 19; chapter 1: 16; John 14: 20); the mighty strengthening of the Spirit (Ephesians 3: 14, et seq.<a name=227:10></a>); dying and rising again (Romans 6: 35; chapter 8: 11, 13; chapter 7: 4; Colossians 2: 12; chapter 3: 3); obtaining the glory of Christ (John 17: 22, 23; 2 Thessalonians 2: 13, 14); overcoming (Revelation 2: 17; chapter 3: 12; 1 John 2: 13, 14; Genesis 32: 28); the sealing of the Spirit (Acts 19: 2, 3, 6; Ephesians 1: 13, 14; 2 Corinthians 1: 21, 22); and in type in the Old Testament, as the crossing of the river Jordan.<a name=227:11></a>

		"The state into which souls are introduced by this experience many of us believe we find described in connection with such ideas as soul union with Jesus (Hosea 2: 16, 19, 20; Romans 7: 4); abiding in Christ (John 15: 4-9); sanctification or holiness (Ezekiel 36: 23-29); 1 Thessalonians 5: 23, 24); full salvation (2 Thessalonians 3: 3; 1 Corinthians 10: 13); Christian (not sinless) perfection (Philippians 3: 12, 15; 1 Corinthians 2: 6; Proverbs 11: 5; 2 Chronicles 16: 9; 1 Kings 15: 14); heart purity (Acts 15: 8, 9; 1 Peter 1: 22; 2 Timothy 2: 22); the peace of God, as distinguished from peace with God (Philippians 4: 6,7); the anointing which abideth (1 John 2: 27); being filled with the Spirit (Ephesians 5: 18, 20); the life more abundant (John 10: 10; chapter 7: 38, 39); following fully (Numbers 14: 24; Revelation 14: 4); risen with Christ (Colossians 2: 12; chapter 3: 1, 3); the life of faith (Galatians 2: 20; Hebrews 11: 8, 13, 17); the rest of faith, or life in the land (Hebrews 3: 17, 19; chapter 4: 3, 10, 11); the riches of full assurance (Colossians 2: 2); deliverance (Romans 7: 24, 25; 1 Corinthians 15: 57; Galatians 5: 16); life in heavenly places (Ephesians 1: 3; chapter 2: 6); dwelling in love (1 John 4: 12, 16); the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ (Romans 15: 13, 29); walking with and pleasing God, or fellowship and communion (Colossians 1: 10; Hebrews 11: 5; 1 John 3: 22; Proverbs 16: 7; Psalm 147: 11; 1 John 1: 3-7; Hebrews 13: 20, 21).<a name=227:12></a>

		"It will, of course, be understood that in this we are referring not so much to what God has done for us, as to what the Spirit does in us; not so much to standing as to state.<a name=227:13></a> As to the former, all God's children are heirs of His, and 'joint-heirs with Christ,' and 'blessed with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places.<a name=227:14></a>' All are 'complete in him,' and by Christ's one offering are 'perfected for ever'; but the realization is another thing, and it is of this that we speak.<a name=227:15></a> The least little one in the host of Israel was as truly in the land as Caleb and Joshua, but in a most important sense the little one did not enter into possession.<a name=227:16></a> We are speaking of the 'apprehension of that for which we are apprehended' (Philippians 3: 12); the working of the Spirit by which we 'may know what is the hope of Christ's calling; the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints, and the exceeding greatness of his power to usward who believe," Ephesians 1: 18, 19.<a name=227:17></a>"]

		I have received the address of the Southern Ohio Association for the Promotion of Scriptural Holiness.<a name=228:1></a> My simple business here is to see whether this system is based on scriptural ground.<a name=228:2></a> I cannot say I believe in associations for holiness, unless it be the church of God; but I let that pass.<a name=228:3></a>
	</div>

		Imperfection is now admitted.<a name=229:1></a> It is "Christian, not sinless, perfection," and the Christian is "full of shortcomings.<a name=229:2></a> An absolutely sinless life cannot be realized.<a name=229:3></a>" I wholly object to the distinction, as vaguely allowing some measure of sin, and yet speaking of perfection.<a name=229:4></a> It is founded on error.<a name=229:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My first remark is, that the system (and I beg attention to this) ignores the communication of what in itself is sinless life, a life that cannot sin, the seed of God in the soul, what is born of the Spirit and is spirit, the new man after God created in righteousness and true holiness.<a name=229:6></a> It is "nature or imparted grace.<a name=229:7></a>" A real being born again, the communication of a new life, the very starting-point of the Christian state (not standing), is supposed, and all depends on this.<a name=229:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next, we are told that Christians "are constantly needing the application of the cleansing blood.<a name=229:9></a>" Now there is no such thought in scripture as a renewed application of the blood of cleansing.<a name=229:10></a> As to this, scripture tells us that without shedding of blood there is no remission: otherwise, the apostle tells us, Christ must have often suffered.<a name=229:11></a> But by one offering He has perfected for ever <i>(eis to dienekes)</i> them that are sanctified.<a name=229:12></a> There is in scripture no re-application of the blood to cleanse.<a name=229:13></a> That is, the two essential foundations of the Christian's state before God are set aside.<a name=229:14></a> And we must remember that we are sanctified through the truth.<a name=229:15></a> The system is wrong in its first principles; it denies the two capital points of true Christianity.<a name=229:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The notion that after we come to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ, we have to grow up into Him in all things, is assuredly not found in scripture, but is a simple absurdity.<a name=229:17></a> I am arrived at a perfect man, the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ, and yet am to grow up farther!<a name=229:18></a> I suppose they may have founded it on some mystical sense of <i>into</i>; but there is no ground for "into," instead of "unto"; it is the same word as "to" a perfect man, "to" the measure.<a name=229:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The mere words in the second paragraph, though unscriptural, I do not speak of; but they are all founded on a totally false and unscriptural notion of the new birth, or rather are really the denial of it.<a name=229:20></a> "Perfect love" is in God, not in us; "full salvation" is only in glory.<a name=229:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=230>[Page 230]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That, as stated in paragraph third, habitual victory over known sin is found in the Lord Jesus Christ, I fully admit.<a name=230:1></a> "Rejoicing in the possession of a pure heart created through faith by the falling of the Holy Ghost," is an utterly unscriptural way of putting the matter, and, as far as true, is true of all Christians.<a name=230:2></a> But it is not a definite and distinct work of the Spirit which was the promise, but His presence.<a name=230:3></a> It is for every one; but a person is not in the Christian state without it, and by it his body is the temple of the Holy Ghost, which cannot be by any distinct work.<a name=230:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		John 14: 17 is quoted to prove that Christians knew the Spirit.<a name=230:5></a> This is all a mistake.<a name=230:6></a> Christ is speaking of the Comforter not yet come (see verse 16); "dwelleth with you" is the same word as "abide.<a name=230:7></a>" Christ could not abide with them; this Comforter, when He was come, would, and be in them, which Christ could not then either.<a name=230:8></a> But the Lord is distinctly speaking of the Comforter not yet come.<a name=230:9></a> He is speaking in express terms of the gift of the Comforter.<a name=230:10></a> I admit, and insist on, the sealing as distinct from conversion and quickening.<a name=230:11></a> But all is confusion here.<a name=230:12></a> This sealing is not "revealing the Son in us.<a name=230:13></a>" The expression refers, as Paul uses it, to Christ's making Himself known to him.<a name=230:14></a> He was sealed after that through Ananias laying his hands upon him.<a name=230:15></a> "Strengthened with might by the Spirit" is the desire of the apostle for those who had received Him, as the apostle expressly declares; Ephesians 1: 13.<a name=230:16></a> "Dying and rising again" is our state in Christ, and belongs to all Christians.<a name=230:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The great mistake of this system is, that it makes an extraordinary mystical condition of what scripture speaks of as the only true Christian state; and so fills with thoughts of themselves those who think they have got it (possibly have been sealed).<a name=230:18></a> And further it is all man's will and heart, not grace and the power of the Holy Ghost, as is said indeed in this paper: "It is not of the mind, but a matter of the will and of the heart"; but of its being a matter of the Holy Ghost's presence and power, which makes a person to be of Christ, not a thought.<a name=230:19></a> The body is dead because of sin, the Spirit life because of righteousness, if Christ be in us; if not, we are none of His, if even like the prodigal on the way.<a name=230:20></a>

		Dead and risen with Christ, and we in Christ, and Christ in us, is the Christian state; different from conversion, I admit, different from being born again; as the prodigal converted, repentant, and returning, was different from the prodigal with the best robe on him, and the ring on his hand, and then only fit to go into the house.<a name=230:21></a> We cannot be in Christ without Christ being in us.<a name=230:22></a> (See John 14: 20; Romans 8: 1, 9, 10.<a name=230:23></a>) One is standing, the other is state.<a name=230:24></a> Romans, however, does not give rising with Christ now as a present state, for this epistle looks on the man as an actual living man down here; Colossians does, but speaks of all Christians when it does.<a name=230:25></a>

		As regards propitiation and substitution, they are points of great importance, and important to distinguish; but, in order to deny the true import of these words, and the truth connected with them, Dr.<a name=265:1></a> Bonar has made confusion, and indeed most mischievous error, out of it.<a name=265:2></a> That Christ, for God's glory, stood as the representative man before God, and in a certain sense took our place, and died for all, making propitiation for the whole world, is true; and I add that if Dr.<a name=265:3></a> Bonar chose to call this substitution, though I should regret it as unfitting, and enfeebling its use in other vital aspects, yet it would not be my place to prescribe words to him.<a name=265:4></a> But he does a great deal more than this.<a name=265:5></a> By his hatred of the truth and fondness for his own views, he has upset the whole gospel.<a name=265:6></a> "The blood brought within the veil," he tells us (page 109), "contained a world-wide message, so that each one hearing of that atoning blood might at once say, then God is summoning me back to Himself," etc.<a name=265:7></a> Be it so; but then "propitiation," he continues, "rests on substitution.<a name=265:8></a> In all these symbolical transactions we have one vast thought, the transference of guilt from one to another, legally and judicially.<a name=265:9></a>" If this be so, then if each one hearing of it could apply it, the guilt of all had been transferred to Christ, and it cannot be untransferred, or transferred back again, for Christ has died under it, a work "perfectly valid for all ends of justice"; consequently there can be no imputation of sins to anybody at all -- the guilt has been transferred.<a name=265:10></a>

		Further, "Without shedding of blood is no remission.<a name=269:11></a>" "Christ is entered into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us" (verse 23) -- always there in the virtue and efficacy of that which He has wrought.<a name=269:12></a> Nor can He "offer himself often as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others, for then must he often have suffered.<a name=269:13></a>" There can be no renewal of imputation or guilt, no expiation, no blood-purging, but by taking the guilt, and drinking the cup.<a name=269:14></a> If Christ expiates and purges (that is, with blood), He must suffer.<a name=269:15></a> But He "hath appeared once in the end of the world to put away sin," been "once offered to bear the sins of many," and "appears the second time to them that look for him" without sin <i>(choris amartias)</i>, having nothing more to do with it for them.<a name=269:16></a> Could anything more distinctly exclude repetition of purging, or repeated purifying, to make the conscience perfect?<a name=269:17></a>

		But is there not a repeated application of what is here spoken of as done once for all?<a name=269:18></a> Let us see the next chapter, where this comes practically up.<a name=269:19></a> Dr.<a name=269:20></a> Bonar insists on repeated purging, repeated application of the great blood-shedding; that it is in constant requisition to cleanse him, is needed to wash evil away, and that in order to the worshippers drawing nigh.<a name=269:21></a> I read that the old Jewish sacrifices could not make the comers thereunto perfect, the repetition being a remembrance that sin was there; but, if it had made them perfect, the purging and offering would cease, as Christ's sacrifice did, because the worshippers once purged would have no more conscience of sins.<a name=269:22></a> Does this look like admitting a perpetual cleansing with blood -- once purged have no more conscience of sins?<a name=269:23></a>

		But it is more explicit still.<a name=270:1></a> Christ comes to do God's will in grace.<a name=270:2></a> "By the which will we are sanctified by the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all," chapter 10: 10.<a name=270:3></a> The Jewish priests were daily standing to accomplish a never-finished work; "but this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins, for ever sat down on the right hand of God, from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.<a name=270:4></a>" For His friends He had no more to do as to this conscience-cleansing work.<a name=270:5></a> "For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.<a name=270:6></a>" And this word "for ever," in verses 12 and 14, is not the word "for ever" used when it is said a priest for ever, <i>eis ton aiona</i>, it is <i>eis to dienekes</i> -- uninterruptedly, without discontinuance.<a name=270:7></a> Thus those sanctified by Christ's offering are continuously, perpetually, perfect, as Christ sits continuously at God's right hand.<a name=270:8></a>

		When it is not a question of conscience, and imputation, and guilt, which does require blood-shedding to put it away, but of communion, there is a cleansing of the state of the soul, but this is by water.<a name=271:1></a> The righteousness and propitiation remain unchanged in their value, and are the foundation of the other.<a name=271:2></a> In 1 John communion is spoken of.<a name=271:3></a> There, "If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous, and he is the propitiation for our sins.<a name=271:4></a>" But an idle thought interrupts communion, and that has to be restored, and Christ's advocacy comes in.<a name=271:5></a> So, in John 13, referring to what He does on high, He washes the disciples' feet, once washed, and in this sense for ever clean (this also with water).<a name=271:6></a> Bathed as the high priest was, they have need only to wash their feet, when they have picked up dirt in their walk.<a name=271:7></a> But it is no repetition of blood applied; there is no such thing in scripture for a Christian.<a name=271:8></a> Practical cleansing for communion there is, but imputation, guilt, has no place; expiation, propitiation, no place; "Jehovah imputeth no sin.<a name=271:9></a>" Christ must suffer often.<a name=271:10></a> If the sin is borne, put away, and He has washed us from our sins in His own blood, all that is done once for all; but to clear the conscience by blood, Christ must suffer.<a name=271:11></a> But this is done once for all.<a name=271:12></a> He sits at God's right hand, because the sanctified are perfected for ever.<a name=271:13></a> Dr.<a name=271:14></a> Bonar has no idea of anything but personal holiness, or perpetual cleansing by blood.<a name=271:15></a> If he will read the Hebrews, he will find perpetual perfectness, no more conscience of sins.<a name=271:16></a> There is besides this a washing of the feet with water, a kind of cleansing, which all who do not see the perfectness of conscience taught in the Hebrews always leave out -- do not apprehend.<a name=271:17></a> The apprehension of what is taught in Hebrews takes the cleansing out of the domain of righteousness, as to which we are perfect, and places it in that of holiness and communion with the Father and His Son Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=271:18></a> Water is the remedy for that; the word, that is, in the power of the Spirit, as blood is for expiation and remission.<a name=271:19></a>

		I will only add further, that Hebrews never contemplates the church as such, but the people of God walking in weakness on the earth, and Christ for them a separate person on high.<a name=271:20></a> Union with Christ is not its subject, and it is just this gives it its preciousness.<a name=271:21></a> Nor does it speak of the Father, but how we believers stand with God, and how we approach; and that is with a perfect conscience through Christ's one offering, so that the worshippers once purged should have no more conscience of sins.<a name=271:22></a> If the reader examine the statements of the Epistle to the Hebrews, he will find that it is the work itself, or the offering of Himself, or it by Christ to God, not the process of application to us, which is spoken of; the effect is, but not the application.<a name=271:23></a> Thus we have, through the Eternal Spirit, offering Himself without spot to God, blood-shedding, the sacrifice of Himself, one offering, entering once into the holy place, not without blood, or in the power of His own blood, into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us.<a name=271:24></a> It is the offering of Himself, or entering into the holy place, but no trace of application to us as the means of its efficacy, still less repeated application.<a name=271:25></a> By one offering He hath perfected for ever, in perpetual continuance, them who are sanctified.<a name=271:26></a> They have no more conscience of sins.<a name=271:27></a>

		CLEANSING AND DELIVERANCE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards perfection, which is often a difficulty, the ground has been taken that, while the flesh never changes, which is perfectly true so far, yet supposing we sin, by referring to the blood of Christ, inasmuch as it cleanses, we are constantly thus perfectly clear.<a name=273:1></a> Blood has to cleanse because we are not clean.<a name=273:2></a> But this does not at all meet the point.<a name=273:3></a> What is wanted is not so much cleansing as power.<a name=273:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Christ's blood, though the ground of all blessing, connects itself directly with the conscience, with imputation, not with power; and to bring in the blood at once raises the question of the state of my conscience, and the consciousness that I am unclean.<a name=273:5></a> They tell me there is power sufficient to put you in relationship with God, and then that you are there pure.<a name=273:6></a> Now it requires earnest and honest attention to make the difference between deliverance from the power of sin and purity.<a name=273:7></a> Because, till we are delivered through a just sense of redemption, the sense of the presence of sin and of want of perfect purity connects itself with conscience and acceptance with God.<a name=273:8></a> Take Christians in general; and you will find they have a kind of feeling, though they would not like to say it, that they must sin.<a name=273:9></a> And quite true it is that, if we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us; and that, in fact, in many things we all offend.<a name=273:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But you will notice in 1 John 1, when it comes to sinning, the apostle puts this in the past tense, "If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.<a name=273:11></a>" Speaking of sin, it is the present tense, "we have no sin"; but of sinning, in the past tense, "we have not sinned," not "if we say we are not sinning"; and there is no such consequence to be drawn as that we must sin.<a name=273:12></a> "My grace," said Christ, "is sufficient for thee, and my strength is made perfect in weakness"; and "God is faithful not to suffer us to be tempted above that we are able.<a name=273:13></a>" "I can do all things through him that strengtheneth me.<a name=273:14></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nor does the existence of the flesh give a bad conscience: else I should never have a good one, because the flesh is always there.<a name=273:15></a> Neither is it a question with me whether God can impute a sin to me as a believer, for Christ has borne them all; nor is it a question of past sins or future sins, inasmuch as for Christians now Christ never bore any but future sins, though past sins are necessarily what affect the conscience.<a name=273:16></a> But the question is, whether that kind of power comes in by which I am brought into a condition where sin is not operative.<a name=273:17></a> I never could say that it must operate.<a name=273:18></a> For God is faithful not to suffer us to be tempted above that we are able; and, if I bear about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, only His life will work in me.<a name=273:19></a> So that if an idle thought is in my mind, I cannot excuse myself.<a name=273:20></a> Grace still acts in the advocacy of Christ; but I never can excuse myself for having ever allowed the flesh to act.<a name=273:21></a> Had I been faithful in closeness to Christ, the flesh would not have acted.<a name=273:22></a> Had I been occupied with Him, the evil would not have found place in my mind.<a name=273:23></a>

		Here is a mother; she is told that her child has been run over at the railway.<a name=274:1></a> She is off directly.<a name=274:2></a> Does she think of the things in the street as she passes?<a name=274:3></a> Not she; on she runs.<a name=274:4></a> All those things which might have been an attraction to her if she had been unoccupied -- a fine dress hung out, or a pretty picture -- they none of them arrest her attention now; she does not see them.<a name=274:5></a> And so ninety-nine out of a hundred temptations never would be such to you if Christ were in your mind.<a name=274:6></a> If we were full of Him, there would be no room for the idle thoughts with which Satan seeks to distract us by the world around us, if he cannot occupy us with them as an object.<a name=274:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And if we do fail, this is no question of putting away sin, and of blood; but it is a question of water, when Christ is an advocate pleading for us to restore our souls.<a name=274:8></a> In John 13 He did not put blood into the basin, but water.<a name=274:9></a> Now, if my feet did not pick up the dirt -- and they ought not to do it -- then I should not need that action in John 13; but they do, and the Spirit of God brings the water of the word to my conscience, and this is the value of the passage.<a name=274:10></a> I have defiled my feet, and then I get water, and not blood.<a name=274:11></a> Water, as a figure, signifies always the application of the word by the power of the Holy Ghost.<a name=274:12></a> Christ has entitled us to heaven, but for our restoration He works in us by the word when it is needed, though it ought not to be.<a name=274:13></a>

		The existence of the flesh does not stop communion, but the allowance of it does.<a name=274:14></a> In 1 John 1 fellowship or communion is the same word; and it is stopped by an idle thought; for the moment it is totally interrupted.<a name=274:15></a> God evidently cannot have communion with such.<a name=274:16></a>

		But, further, in connection with this, Christ dying for our sins is quite distinct from our dying with Christ; it is a different thing entirely.<a name=275:1></a> We are called upon to recognize this, and live in the power of it.<a name=275:2></a> If we are dead with Christ, then "reckon yourselves" so; only I add that this is not finding out that I have died at a particular moment, and am brought by faith into this state (though every truth is learned by faith), but the truth learned here is that I died in Christ's death.<a name=275:3></a> It is my Christian profession.<a name=275:4></a> Being baptized unto Christ, I am baptized unto His death, and when the apostle bears about in his body the dying of the Lord Jesus, it is clearly not his own dying, but, as it states, the dying of Jesus.<a name=275:5></a> The thing I say is, Christ was the one who bore my sins, and so I get pardon; but I find no pardon for the evil nature.<a name=275:6></a> "What the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh.<a name=275:7></a>" But when God did that, what happened?<a name=275:8></a> Christ died; then I am dead.<a name=275:9></a> If it had been myself personally under law, I should have had condemnation as well as death; but being crucified with Christ, condemnation is gone, and the death has come.<a name=275:10></a> If I apply it practically, and honestly say I am dead, how can Satan tempt a dead man?<a name=275:11></a> And how can you say a dead man has lusts and a bad will?<a name=275:12></a> It is not true.<a name=275:13></a> Yet this doctrine of purity in yourselves attained by faith, and that without the self-knowledge gained by exercise of heart under law, as taught in Romans 7, is very rife around us; and it is winning honest and sincere persons through the craving for a deliverance they have not got.<a name=275:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is stated that there is a purifying that makes us now like Christ here.<a name=275:15></a> But this is unscriptural.<a name=275:16></a> It is asked, "Did you not when converted desire to be conformed to Christ?<a name=275:17></a>" But this is misleading people's souls; for I desire it now too.<a name=275:18></a> But what is taught in scripture is that, "when he shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.<a name=275:19></a> And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself even as he is pure.<a name=275:20></a>" This is a very different story.<a name=275:21></a> If I am already purified, I do not want to purify myself.<a name=275:22></a> The conformity to Christ proposed in scripture is in glory.<a name=275:23></a> He was absolutely without sin here; if I say I have none, I deceive myself.<a name=275:24></a> I ought to walk as He walked, not allowing sin to stir in me; but it is there in the flesh.<a name=275:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The effect of the whole thought is to lower the standard of the Christian altogether.<a name=275:26></a> I want to be like Christ in glory, and I shall be; and, meanwhile, though the flesh is here, this in itself would not interrupt my communion; and I recognize fully that as a Christian I ought, not grieving the Holy Spirit of God, to live constantly in the unclouded sense of God's favour.<a name=275:27></a>

		I dare say there may be Christians who never have really comprehended what it is to be dead and risen with Christ.<a name=276:1></a> They cannot, as to their own souls, take this up.<a name=276:2></a> It is what the scripture calls being "perfect"; that is, not merely being forgiven the sins of the first Adam, but having our place in the Second, and that in the power of the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus.<a name=276:3></a> We shall be actually perfect when like Him in glory; never before, because this is our standard.<a name=276:4></a> But if I have realized that I am in Him, dead and risen with Him, as He is, so am I in this world -- first, as to judgment, and then as to the power of life and state before God, recognizing the deadness of the old man for faith through Christ's death on the cross.<a name=276:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the view I have referred to supposes that a person can by faith slip into a state of purity; just as by faith he knows his justification.<a name=276:6></a> Now such are deceiving themselves, and that for this reason -- you do not know yourselves yet, and you must.<a name=276:7></a> I repeat, what I have said elsewhere, that you do not get out of Romans 7 in some shape, till you have got into it, and know not merely guilt, not merely that you have an evil flesh, but, what is harder to learn, and more thoroughly humbling, that you have no power.<a name=276:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Suppose a person owed money, and I tell him it is all paid.<a name=276:9></a> If he believes I am a man of my word, no experience is needed; he is at ease, and very glad to hear it.<a name=276:10></a> But suppose I say, You are dead to sin.<a name=276:11></a> This is not the payment of a debt, it is an absolute statement of your condition.<a name=276:12></a> The man might say, "What is the good of telling me that?<a name=276:13></a> Why, I was in a passion this morning.<a name=276:14></a>" His experience contradicts me.<a name=276:15></a> Nor can you get out of the difficulty until you have come to the personal consciousness, the self-knowledge, which finds out that you cannot get the victory over sin.<a name=276:16></a> It is a terrible thing to see; but it is learning this, that I have no power, and not merely that I am guilty.<a name=276:17></a> "To will is present with me, but how to perform that which is good I find not"; and until you are brought to the conscience of "O wretched man that I am!<a name=276:18></a> who shall deliver me?<a name=276:19></a>" I cannot succeed; sin is too strong for me; I am not brought to the point, where alone the deliverance is got.<a name=276:20></a> I may or may not have the knowledge of forgiveness.<a name=276:21></a> This modifies the form, but not the substance, of the experience.<a name=276:22></a> It is always essentially under law, that is, a claim upon us to be in a given state.<a name=276:23></a> But you say "I must try.<a name=276:24></a>" "Very well," I say, "Try away, try away.<a name=276:25></a>" Why?<a name=276:26></a> Because then he will learn that he cannot, and presently he will say, not "How shall I do better?<a name=276:27></a>" but, "Who shall deliver me?<a name=276:28></a>" He is then in such a condition that another must take him out of it.<a name=276:29></a> He finds he is not only ungodly, but without strength; he has learned what he is, not merely what he has done; and then he sees Christ there in power, and the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus makes him free from the law of sin and death.<a name=276:30></a> This is not a question of non-imputation, nor of cleansing, but of making free.<a name=276:31></a> Then I find it settled in seeing the truth and ground of it in the cross of Christ, and not in my personally obtaining of purity at a given moment.<a name=276:32></a>

		Another thing I would just add.<a name=277:1></a> I ask, Are you content to have died then, and not to have the least atom of will of your own, nor wish, nor desire?<a name=277:2></a> Is there nothing in your heart that you would like to hold back against God?<a name=277:3></a> This tests us.<a name=277:4></a> Have we so learned what the principle of will is, or do we want to keep a little bit of it?<a name=277:5></a> Our state ought always to be one of unhindered communion in the power of the Holy Ghost without a cloud upon our spirits.<a name=277:6></a> But this is not really the state of things, and so it is power we want.<a name=277:7></a>

		I have carefully compared with scripture, I trust before God, the system now pressed upon many as the desirable Christian condition of liberty and holiness.<a name=278:1></a> I have done it in His fear, not willing to lose any profit or advantage which faith in divine power could give me.<a name=278:2></a> However happy, I am too poor and weak not to be glad to have everything I can of Christ and of His Spirit.<a name=278:3></a> I admit that mere knowledge is far from being all, even when correct in the things of God.<a name=278:4></a> Power by the operation of the Spirit is needed, and the evangelical world is very unbelieving as to this.<a name=278:5></a> Still we are sanctified through the truth, and hence the question is -- Is this system the truth, the truth of God?<a name=278:6></a> It seems to me to fail entirely, if examined by scripture as to the true standing of God's children -- their real place in peace before Him; it has not learned this place, nor the character, extent, and means of holiness.<a name=278:7></a> It comes wholly short of the state of conscience produced by the Holy Ghost consequent on redemption, and as a necessary consequence lowers the character of holiness, and eclipses the place Christ should hold in the heart.<a name=278:8></a> There is more than one thing, I think, true in it, and important to Christians in these days; and it is because these are obscured by false teaching, and souls are thus misled, that I take notice of it.<a name=278:9></a> I desire to speak soberly, not slighting what is true, but guarding the soul of my reader, if God graciously permit and deign so to use it, against what obscures the truth.<a name=278:10></a> I shall first state what I do not oppose, that I may give no handle to those who might reject the presence and operation of the Spirit of God, and give all due credit to those who look for it.<a name=278:11></a>

		In Mr.<a name=278:12></a> R.<a name=278:13></a> page Smith's last work, "Walking in the Light," there are counsels which are useful, such as, when temptation is there, to look at once to Christ, One who has overcome.<a name=278:14></a> I have no doubt that, when we do, the enemy will flee, so to speak, as a frightened bird.<a name=278:15></a> It is not simply as if we were better, but the thing is gone.<a name=278:16></a> We may have sometimes to wait where there has been any giving way, but if we resist the devil, he flees from us.<a name=278:17></a> And this is important for assailed saints; there is positive strength in Christ and grace sufficient for us.<a name=278:18></a> I repeat, it is not merely an improvement or change; the assailing evil is gone.<a name=278:19></a>

		That God often heals the sick in answer to prayer is clearly taught both in James and John: in the former according to ecclesiastical order, though by the prayer of faith; in the latter as an individual matter, and I have seen and assisted at the clearest examples of this both in England and on the continent.<a name=279:14></a> In two cases, at the request of the parties, prayer was accompanied by anointing.<a name=279:15></a>

		There is danger of the mind being turned to, and stopping at, what after all is only a testimony, though a blessed one.<a name=279:16></a> The professing church has lost the sense of that which characterizes Christianity -- the present living power of the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven.<a name=279:17></a> It is not the end; for He leads us to the Father and the Son, and is the present power of our condition.<a name=279:18></a>

		But it is of all importance not to separate the Spirit from the word of God, as it is not to separate the word from the present power of the Holy Ghost.<a name=279:19></a> The word is the sword of the Spirit, and what it reveals is spiritually discerned.<a name=279:20></a> The pretension to use it by the power of the human mind, or judge it by conscience, is really rationalism, or, to speak plainly, infidelity.<a name=279:21></a> And taking the power of the Spirit apart from the word lays men open to take every wild imagination of man and even an evil spirit for the Holy Ghost, as the word plainly shews us.<a name=279:22></a> Those who know the early history of Friends know the excesses to which some ran.<a name=279:23></a> It will be said, you cannot attribute this to the body or to those who were esteemed leaders among them.<a name=279:24></a> I admit it; but I do attribute it to the principle adopted by them: that the Spirit in them was superior to the word, a name which indeed they would not give to the scriptures, and this has been openly avowed to myself now by those who looked to the present special operation of the Spirit and its power.<a name=279:25></a>

		The ground they go upon is the common ground of unbelief in the offering of Christ -- the doctrine of continually cleansing and recleansing in Christ's blood.<a name=281:12></a> This is wholly unscriptural, and subversive of true Christian standing according to the word -- that the worshippers <i>once</i> purged should have <i>no more</i> conscience of sins.<a name=281:13></a> Nothing can be clearer or more positive than the teaching of Hebrews 9 and 10 on this subject, where it is elaborately argued, in contrast with the repetition of Jewish sacrifices, and as giving us boldness to enter into the holiest.<a name=281:14></a> The question raised is of a perfect conscience; and a perpetually unchangeably perfect conscience is elaborately taught, with a declaration that otherwise Christ must often have suffered, but that His work has done this once for all.<a name=281:15></a> He was once offered to bear the sins of many, and appears a second time without sin to salvation; a repeated cleansing of the conscience by blood is herein formally negatived.<a name=281:16></a> Christianity is contrasted with Judaism on this particular point.<a name=281:17></a> It is the offering, the <i>blood-shedding</i>, which clears the conscience, and that could be only once, and so that the worshippers <i>once</i> purged should have no more conscience of sins; and hence, while the Jewish priests were always standing, because their work was never done, Christ, having offered one sacrifice for sins, is sitting constantly at the right hand of God, having no more to do as to the worshippers' conscience, because by one offering He has perfected for ever them that are sanctified-by one offering, note, and thus we have <i>no more</i> conscience of sins.<a name=281:18></a> And this word "for ever" is here <i>eis to dienekes</i>, not <i>eis ton aiona</i>, that which is continuous and uninterrupted, as Christ now sits at the right hand of God, constantly, till His enemies be made His footstool.<a name=281:19></a> And remark that it is not merely the putting away of sins efficaciously, true as of course that is (see Hebrews 1: 3), but the perfecting of the conscience; Hebrews 9: 9; chapter 10: 1, 2, 12, 14; and see 12, 19.<a name=281:20></a> The Epistle to the Hebrews teaches clearly, unequivocally, insisting on it as characteristic of Christianity, a conscience <i>constantly</i> perfect, as sure as Christ is ever sitting on the right hand of God; perfect, not by repeated application of His blood, which is being imperfect, and cleansed again and again, but <i>no more</i> conscience of sins, <i>perfected for ever</i>, and that by one single thing in contrast with repeated cleansings.<a name=281:21></a> This blessed truth and state is ignored and denied by the system I am commenting on.<a name=281:22></a> The whole place is lost for the soul -- the very truth God is pressing on His saints for their deliverance.<a name=281:23></a>

		Nor is this all.<a name=290:1></a> This wretched doctrine of repeated cleansing by blood hinders all self-knowledge and true growth by it.<a name=290:2></a> It is not a question of pardon: this is settled; nor doubting divine love: the Father loves us as He loved Jesus.<a name=290:3></a> But when the Lord looked on Peter, he went out and wept bitterly.<a name=290:4></a> Was he wrong?<a name=290:5></a> But more, when the Lord restores his soul, He never speaks a word of reproach as to his denying Him, nor refers to it.<a name=290:6></a> It was put away by the death of Jesus, but He does say, "Lovest thou Me more than these?<a name=290:7></a>" He goes to the root of it in the heart of Peter -- self-confidence.<a name=290:8></a> "If all deny thee, I will not.<a name=290:9></a>" That is, there is no hint of remaining guilt, but.<a name=290:10></a> there is a probing to the root of the evil, of which the actual failure was only a fruit.<a name=290:11></a> Now this cool return to rest and ease of heart looses all this.<a name=290:12></a> There is no searching of the spring of evil, unsuspected perhaps in the soul, for growth in true spiritual life; and the soul is never thoroughly restored and blessed till this is done.<a name=290:13></a>

		"HIGHER HOLINESS"  -- A REVIEW OF DR. A. MOODY STUART'S CLOSING ADDRESS AS MODERATOR OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE FREE CHURCH OF SCOTLAND
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The question of holiness has recently stirred up too widely the Christian mind not to give attention to every form in which it is claimed.<a name=295:1></a> It has, I believe, usefully roused Christians' minds to the sense that there ought to be deliverance from the bondage of sin, and more entire devotedness to Christ -- self-surrender to Him.<a name=295:2></a> As is ever the case, when what is true and important is based upon false principles, it has been accompanied by, or mixed up with, what is false -- with the fruit of these false principles.<a name=295:3></a> Our part is to separate the precious from the vile, that we be as God's mouth.<a name=295:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The form in which this demand of holiness or perfection has been put forward, whether by Wesleyans or Mr.<a name=295:5></a> Pearsall Smith, has been pretty fully met, and I do not now recur to their views.<a name=295:6></a> The Moderator of the Free Church Assembly has stated his views on the subject; and as they involve some very important principles, and the position and character of Dr.<a name=295:7></a> Stuart will naturally command the respect of many, I will briefly weigh his statements.<a name=295:8></a> An excellent man, I doubt not, though personally unacquainted with him, and sound in the faith, he will not object to his sentiments being weighed by scripture.<a name=295:9></a> His mind, at any rate his statements, are neither clear nor accurate, always a difficulty in reviewing the thoughts of another.<a name=295:10></a> They are vague; but certain great principles are sufficiently clear to examine whether they are scriptural.<a name=295:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I shall notice some of this vagueness where all is well meant.<a name=295:12></a> For the real result is that, with the best intentions, the statements mean nothing: only they ignore the true question.<a name=295:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Outside the camp (he tells us) we find the Holy One numbered with transgressors.<a name=295:14></a> In that same hour his blood purges our conscience from dead works to serve the living God.<a name=295:15></a> We are renewed in the whole man after the image of God, in mind, in will, in heart; and sin hath not dominion over us because we are under grace.<a name=295:16></a>" This is merely using the general effect for the reality of the state; the question of a new nature or life, and of the law, is carefully dropped.<a name=295:17></a> But I add, sin where?<a name=295:18></a> If it be in us, the whole man is not renewed.<a name=295:19></a> Scripture says, the new man is renewed in knowledge after God -- is created in righteousness and true holiness; never that the whole man is.<a name=295:20></a> Practically sanctifying wholly is spoken of, and our being preserved; but the old man is said to be put off, not renewed.<a name=295:21></a> Scripture makes the division Dr.<a name=295:22></a> Stuart objects to.<a name=295:23></a> In fact, Dr.<a name=295:24></a> Stuart reduces the new birth to being born of water, leaving out being born of the Spirit.<a name=295:25></a> Death, not change, is what frees [justifies] us from sin.<a name=295:26></a> Our old man is crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be destroyed [rendered null].<a name=295:27></a> But of this point I will speak farther on.<a name=295:28></a>

		"It cannot however," we are told, "be set forth as within the plan of redemption that perfect holiness should be ours on earth.<a name=296:10></a> If we wash our hands with snow water, and make ourselves never so clean, we are quickly plunged into the ditch again, and compelled to cry out, 'O wretched man that I am!<a name=296:11></a> who shall deliver me from the body of this death?<a name=296:12></a>'"

		"Where sin and Christ met together on the cross, Christ finished transgression for us, and made an end of sin.<a name=297:1></a>" Christ was made sin for us who knew no sin; but sin and Christ meeting on the cross has no truth in it at all.<a name=297:2></a> I have no doubt this is a misapplication of the passage, but I leave that aside.<a name=297:3></a> But Dr.<a name=297:4></a> Stuart adds, "And so in us, when sin and the grace of Jesus Christ meet together, grace triumphs -- in the end always triumphs, and over every kind of sin.<a name=297:5></a>" What has this to do with Christ "made sin" on the cross?<a name=297:6></a> and how do sin and grace meet together in us?<a name=297:7></a> What does sin mean here?<a name=297:8></a> I suppose a particular lust; but all is vague.<a name=297:9></a> The whole man was said to be renewed in mind, will, heart.<a name=297:10></a> The man was plunged quickly, it is true, in the ditch, yet not defeated!<a name=297:11></a> The teaching is really deplorable, and so vague that no soul can find where it is, save that, with a sense that it ought to triumph, it experiences being "plunged in the ditch," and cries out, "O wretched man that I am!<a name=297:12></a>" And this is holiness!<a name=297:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to "Job, Daniel, and Paul," the statement that "the higher any man rises in nearness and in likeness to God, he is always the more deeply conscious of sin," is entirely unfounded.<a name=297:14></a> Job failed exactly in being conscious of sin, and made himself more just than God, and was overwhelmed into abhorrence of himself by God's revelation of Himself.<a name=297:15></a> Daniel never speaks of sin in himself at all, but in grace identifies himself with the past sins of Israel.<a name=297:16></a> Of Paul I will speak more fully.<a name=297:17></a> But there is no kind of evidence, that the nearer he was to God, the more conscious he was of sin.<a name=297:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Besides, it is the excessive vagueness of all this I complain of.<a name=297:19></a> What does conscious of sin mean?<a name=297:20></a> of its power actually in us?<a name=297:21></a> that there is an evil nature in us always simply bad?<a name=297:22></a> How then, is the whole man renewed?<a name=297:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is the division of nature which Dr.<a name=297:24></a> Moody Stuart rejects.<a name=297:25></a> That the nearer we are to God the more we judge sin by a divine measure in ourselves, as in nature, is quite true; but that is not being more conscious of sin.<a name=297:26></a> All is deplorably vague and uncertain; and he whose whole man is renewed is at the same time, we are told, carnal, sold under sin.<a name=297:27></a> All this flows from denying the opposition of the flesh and spirit, and putting the Christian under the law, according to Romans 7, reducing us to Judaism; for in the Old Testament the doctrine as to the conflict of natures was not revealed, and the character of holiness pretty much what Dr.<a name=297:28></a> Stuart makes it -- integrity of heart, loyalty of heart to God.<a name=297:29></a> God has now revealed Himself, and makes us partakers of His holiness.<a name=297:30></a> If I take the law as my measure, it is unscriptural to say, when I have the power of Christ, I cannot keep it.<a name=297:31></a> It is saying I must sin, which is not true.<a name=297:32></a> To say in many things we do all offend, is scriptural; to say that we must, is very evil.<a name=297:33></a>
	</div>

		Again, to say that it would be necessary for one child of God, who strives to be in the fear of God all the day long, to live for a day in the measure of hardness and deadness of another, is senseless, because if he were in the deadness and hardness he would not feel the evil.<a name=298:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The teaching then is most vague and unsatisfactory; but I must go to its root.<a name=298:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to mistaken views, that holiness is in the will, so that we may pass over emotions (or, as the American perfectionists say, suggestions), as not sin, I reject with Dr.<a name=298:3></a> Stuart; so also that all is sunshine.<a name=298:4></a> These therefore I leave aside.<a name=298:5></a>

		Dr.<a name=298:12></a> Moody Stuart says, "As regards what constitutes holiness in redeemed men on earth, the dangerous opinion has been advanced, which makes a very excessive distinction, or rather division, between the new man and the old, between the flesh and the spirit in the believer, as if the sinfulness of the flesh were to be disregarded on account of the holiness of the spirit: forgetting that it is still one person in whom the evil and the good are found.<a name=298:13></a>"

		Let us see what is plainly declared in scripture.<a name=299:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, that which is born of the Spirit is spirit," John 3: 6.<a name=299:2></a> Is not this distinguishing them completely in their origin and nature, carefully so distinguishing, making a division between two distinct and contrary natures?<a name=299:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Man must be born anew <i>(anothen).<a name=299:4></a> "Anew</i>" is not a change or purifying what exists, but what, from the beginning onward, is a new birth.<a name=299:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are born of God afresh; "of His own will begat he us by the word of truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures"; we are "born of the incorruptible seed of the word," and receiving Christ, He is our life.<a name=299:6></a> "And this is the record that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in His Son.<a name=299:7></a> He that hath the Son hath life.<a name=299:8></a> He that hath not the Son of God hath not life.<a name=299:9></a>" It is that which Adam innocent had not more than Adam guilty.<a name=299:10></a> "Christ is our life.<a name=299:11></a>" It is not we that live, but "Christ liveth in us.<a name=299:12></a>" Our duty is to manifest the life of Jesus in our bodies.<a name=299:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That this produces a change in the whole man is most true, yet it is not a change, but a new thing given -- eternal life that God hath given us, that eternal life which was with the Father and was manifested to us, and is become our life, Christ, the second Man.<a name=299:14></a> It is not I, but Christ that lives in me.<a name=299:15></a> Nothing can be more distinct than the corrupt first Adam, the flesh, and Christ, the last Adam, who, risen from the dead, is become "our life.<a name=299:16></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us see if scripture does not distinguish and oppose them one to another.<a name=299:17></a> As to the flesh, "it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.<a name=299:18></a> So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.<a name=299:19></a> But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be the Spirit of God dwell in you.<a name=299:20></a> If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.<a name=299:21></a> And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin, and the Spirit is life because of righteousness," Romans 8: 7-10.<a name=299:22></a> Does not this put them in division and formal opposition?<a name=299:23></a> Again, in Galatians 5: 17, "The flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh, and these are contrary the one to the other.<a name=299:24></a>" Could there be a plainer or more formal statement of what Dr.<a name=299:25></a> Moody Stuart objects to, or contradiction of his objection?<a name=299:26></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But this contrariety is expressed in the strongest way in scripture.<a name=300:1></a> Christians have put off the old man with his deeds; where, note, the deeds, the fruits, are distinguished from the man or nature.<a name=300:2></a> They have put on the new man.<a name=300:3></a> This new man is created after God.<a name=300:4></a> But more: death is the portion of the old man.<a name=300:5></a> Our old man is crucified with Christ, dead with Christ.<a name=300:6></a> We are dead and our life hid with Christ our life; to reckon ourselves dead and alive to God, not in Adam but in Christ.<a name=300:7></a> In us, that is, in our flesh, dwells no good thing, but Christ lives in us.<a name=300:8></a> So for practice we are to carry about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life of Jesus may be manifested in our bodies.<a name=300:9></a> He that is dead is freed (justified) from sin.<a name=300:10></a> And this old man and sin in the flesh is condemned wholly and finally, but, for faith, dead.<a name=300:11></a> "The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.<a name=300:12></a> For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh.<a name=300:13></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The doctrinal portion of the whole Epistle to the Romans is divided into two parts.<a name=300:14></a> The first part of it tells us how grace has met our guilt, as having sinned, by Christ's death; and, secondly, from chapter 5: 12, how we have died with Christ, and thus sin in the flesh met.<a name=300:15></a> All this is ignored by Dr.<a name=300:16></a> Stuart, and merged in a renewal of the whole man.<a name=300:17></a> The works of the flesh, and the fruit of the Spirit, are contrasted in scripture as flowing from two distinct sources -- the divine nature, under the power of the Spirit, and the flesh, in which no good thing dwells, from which deliverance is only by death, actually by actual death, and practically now by reckoning ourselves dead, as crucified with Christ.<a name=300:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This leads me to Romans 7, in which this system of Dr.<a name=300:19></a> Moody Stuart's leaves the Christian, just as scripture carefully takes him out of it.<a name=300:20></a> And I do not conceal from myself that, quite admitting the personal piety of those who do not see it, this changes the whole nature and character of Christianity.<a name=300:21></a> Paul diligently teaches that a Christian is not where this system leaves him, and that he who is in Romans 7 is not in the proper sense a Christian at all.<a name=300:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We must not blink the full assertion of this -- IT IS A QUESTION OF WHAT CHRISTIANITY PRACTICALLY IS.<a name=301:1></a> A soul may be in the way, and He who has begun the good work will perfect it; but he is not yet in the Christian state at all while he is in the state described in Romans 7.<a name=301:2></a> The prodigal was converted, repentant, on the right road; but he had not the best robe on till he met his father; Luke 15.<a name=301:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe it often happens that the mind is in Romans through bad teaching, when it is really delivered in its relationship with God; many are so.<a name=301:4></a> But this does not affect the fact that there are two states entirely distinct, one the Christian state, the other not; not merely knowing it or not (of this I have spoken), but two distinct states.<a name=301:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Israel out of Egypt and brought to God's holy habitation, as in Exodus 15, was in a different state from Israel in Egypt, though God had visited them.<a name=301:6></a> The prodigal converted and repentant, without the best robe and having never met his father, was in a different condition from what he was with the best robe on him, and fit, and then only fit, to go into the house.<a name=301:7></a> Before, it was his own thoughts of what might be his state when he arrived; but when come, all was wholly and solely and actually according to his father's revealed mind.<a name=301:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Dr.<a name=301:9></a> Stuart, with alas!<a name=301:10></a> thousands of others, puts the Christian in the experience of Romans 7, and consequently treats him as carnal, sold under sin.<a name=301:11></a> I affirm that the whole object of the apostle's reasoning is to shew that a Christian is not there, but delivered from it, and that deliverance from it is the only true Christian state.<a name=301:12></a> Indeed I say more, namely, that what the apostle insists on is the absolute incompatibility of the two states -- that a person can no more be under the authority of the law and that of Christ at the same time, than a woman have two husbands.<a name=301:13></a> This makes the issue definite and plain enough, and I state it so because I am persuaded that it is a question of what true Christianity is, and in these days is of vital importance.<a name=301:14></a> Many, many years I have taken the same ground for the deliverance of individual souls; but things are come to a crisis, and all is inquired into, and it behoves us to know what the word of God teaches.<a name=301:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have already stated that the doctrinal portion of the Epistle to the Romans is composed of two parts, which divide at the end of chapter 5: 11.<a name=301:16></a> (Chapters 9, 10, 11 are an appendix to reconcile the promises made to the Jews, with his no-difference doctrine.<a name=301:17></a>) The former part treats the question of sins or guilt; the second, sin, or the evil nature -- the flesh.<a name=301:18></a> With Dr.<a name=301:19></a> Moody Stuart, stains of guilt and stains of unholiness are all thrown together, and all is vague.<a name=301:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=302>[Page 302]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us now see how the Spirit of God treats the question of sin and the flesh.<a name=302:1></a> He leaves the ground of individual responsibility and works, on which we are guilty, and exposed to judgment, and leads us up to the great heads, Adam and Christ, the law coming in, by the bye (<i>pareiselthe</i>), between.<a name=302:2></a> But by one man's disobedience the many (all connected with him, <i>oi polloi)</i> were made sinners, by one man's obedience the many (all connected with Him) should be made righteous.<a name=302:3></a> The objection of the world rises up at once; if one man's obedience constitutes me righteous, I may live on in sin.<a name=302:4></a> The answer is not to put man again under law, as is done so unscripturally in a flesh which cannot be subject to it, but to deliver man from sin in a wholly new life which does not come from the first Adam at all, but from Christ, the last Adam, so that He should live in this life: but more, His death to the old Adam-life also -- not physically of course, but by faith, in that Christ, who is our life, has died.<a name=302:5></a> We have been crucified with Him, nevertheless we live; but not we, but Christ lives in us.<a name=302:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us see what is said of this in Romans 6, which is the full statement of this great truth.<a name=302:7></a> Let my reader remember that this part of the epistle does not treat of sins and guilt, but of sin; of the tree, and not of the fruit.<a name=302:8></a> How have we part in this righteousness of chapter 5?<a name=302:9></a> In having part in death-Christ's death.<a name=302:10></a> How then live on?<a name=302:11></a> That is the apostle's thesis.<a name=302:12></a> "How shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein?<a name=302:13></a>" The very profession we make, what we are baptized to, is to Christ's death; and we know that our old man is crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be destroyed <i>(katergethe)</i>.<a name=302:14></a> In that Christ died He died unto sin, and in that He liveth He liveth unto God.<a name=302:15></a> "Likewise reckon yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God in Jesus Christ our Lord" -- not in Adam: as to that, we are to reckon ourselves dead.<a name=302:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then comes our yielding ourselves to God (the practical walk of godliness in its root principle) as those that are alive from the dead.<a name=302:17></a> Thus the Christian is placed on a sure and fixed basis for his walk.<a name=302:18></a> He has died in Christ, and he lives in Christ, since he is justified from sin.<a name=302:19></a> You cannot charge evil lusts and a wicked will on a dead man.<a name=302:20></a> This shews the importance of distinguishing sin and sins.<a name=302:21></a> While alive he may have committed all manner of sins, and have to answer for them; but you cannot charge a dead man with sin as a present thing.<a name=302:22></a>

		<a name=303>[Page 303]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How does this affect the question of his being under law?<a name=303:1></a> He is not under it at all; Romans 6: 14.<a name=303:2></a> Law has power over a man so long as he lives; but we have died.<a name=303:3></a> We have become dead to the law by the body of Christ, that we might be married to another, to Christ that is raised from the dead; (chapter 7: 4).<a name=303:4></a> The metaphor is changed in verse 6 (not indeed in the text, which makes the law die as the first husband); but the marginal reading is, I may say, universally accepted as true, as indeed it connects itself with the whole reasoning of the passage.<a name=303:5></a> We have died, and are freed from the first husband, the law; we <i>(katergethemen)</i> have been set aside from the law, having died in it.<a name=303:6></a> As he says in Galatians, I through the law am dead to the law by the body of Christ.<a name=303:7></a> If a man had died simply by the law to it, it was condemnation too; but being in Christ, He has taken the condemnation of sin in the flesh, and we have part in death to it.<a name=303:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first husband then, the law, is done with, and we are married to a risen Christ, and cannot in any sense or form be under the authority of two husbands at a time.<a name=303:9></a> It is adultery.<a name=303:10></a> It is, we alive in flesh (and if not wholly lawless) under law, or we dead as to it with Christ by faith and married to a risen Christ, and the law in its authority in every sense gone as to us, for it reigns over a man only as long as he lives.<a name=303:11></a> Hence it is said, "when we were in the flesh, the motions of sin which were by the law.<a name=303:12></a>" I cannot say, "when I was," if I am in a place.<a name=303:13></a> I must be out of it to speak so, as is yet more clear in Romans 8: 9.<a name=303:14></a> The doctrine then is, that we have died, and are thus wholly delivered from the law and its authority, to have another husband.<a name=303:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the apostle gives the experience of a renewed soul under the first husband.<a name=303:16></a> For of the law only there is question here.<a name=303:17></a> Christ and the Spirit are not mentioned, save for deliverance from that state.<a name=303:18></a> It is solely and simply a renewed soul under the first husband, the law, learning there what flesh is -- that flesh is not subject to it, nor can be, and that we have in this case no power to fulfil it, even if we love it.<a name=303:19></a> Verses 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 each shew it is the law that is in question as to experience.<a name=303:20></a> Deliverance only comes in verse 25, and is developed in chapter 8; the full reasoning on it is in verse 14, in 16, and in 22.<a name=303:21></a> We Christians know the spirituality of the law, and so it is felt to be by the renewed man, and his conscience consents to it as good, his heart delights in it; but he never performs it, does not find how to perform it, learns what sin (not sins) is, that there is no good thing in the flesh (sin becomes exceeding sinful), that the flesh is contrary to it all; but he also learns that he has no power to fulfil it.<a name=303:22></a> Sin, as a law in his members, makes him captive.<a name=303:23></a> He never does the good he would, but practises the evil he hates.<a name=303:24></a> Deliverance and power is what is in question.<a name=303:25></a> He is the slave of sin, sold under it, captive to it, learns to distinguish what Dr.<a name=303:26></a> Stuart will not have divided, but learns that under law the sin he hates is too powerful for his delight in the law; and that being in the flesh, not dead and alive in Christ, he is captive to the law of sin.<a name=303:27></a>

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=304>[Page 304]</a>

		Christianity, besides forgiveness and righteousness before God, is just deliverance from this state by death to it in Christ, and power, the power of a new life in Christ, in which the Holy Ghost works, we being set free by the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=304:1></a> Colossians and Ephesians go farther, but I confine myself to this one point now.<a name=304:2></a> This holy liberty is developed in Romans 8: 1-11 on to actual resurrection.<a name=304:3></a> Perfectionists have taken this deliverance for perfection; Dr.<a name=304:4></a> Stuart and Evangelicals deny the deliverance, and would keep us in Romans 7.<a name=304:5></a> Scriptural Christianity rejects both, because it shews that sin dwells in us on the one hand, and has power over us on the other, but that there is deliverance from that power.<a name=304:6></a>

		Dr.<a name=304:7></a> Stuart takes merely the outside change, which, if consistent, should go on to Wesleyan perfection, denying deliverance from Romans 7, and the fact of the flesh being totally distinct from the new life, the last Adam as life in us from sinful flesh, and makes all Christians carnal, sold under sin!<a name=304:8></a> Christianity shews we cannot say we have no sin, but that we have died in Christ to it, are to reckon ourselves dead, and alive to God in Christ, and so delivered from the power of sin, that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit; for the Christian is not in the flesh in which the law could not be fulfilled, for it was not, and cannot, be subject to it.<a name=304:9></a> Dr.<a name=304:10></a> Stuart, in terms, makes the Christian carnal, sold under sin, and holds he cannot fulfil the law.<a name=304:11></a> Christianity delivers him from that state that he may fulfil it.<a name=304:12></a> It does a great deal more, but it does that.<a name=304:13></a> The Christian is one who lives by the power of spiritual life in Christ, a totally new thing which he has received -- life in a risen Christ, God having given His only-begotten Son, that we might live through Him, His death and resurrection having set us free; so that, while this holy freedom is realised in the power of a new life, we have the title and duty to count ourselves dead in Christ's death, our old man (the flesh) crucified with Him.<a name=304:14></a>

		Let us briefly see how this liberty is depicted in Romans 8.<a name=305:1></a> "There is no condemnation for them who are in Christ Jesus"; not whose sins have been borne by Christ, which clears and justifies us, but who are in a wholly new place in Christ; not in Adam or fleshly standing (for then they could not please God, and there they were when under the law, responsible for themselves for righteousness), but now redeemed wholly out of that place; not merely God met perfectly as a judge, like the blood on the lintel and door-posts, but as Israel out of Egypt, redeemed out of the place they were in (God being a Saviour or Deliverer) and in a new one, not in the flesh but in Christ.<a name=305:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This involves the corresponding truth of Christ in us.<a name=305:3></a> (Compare John 14: 20.<a name=305:4></a>) The blood is the strongest motive for walking, but this is a nature, a life which walks.<a name=305:5></a> Redemption and a new state of holy liberty go together.<a name=305:6></a> I am not seeking who shall deliver.<a name=305:7></a> "The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death," Romans 8: 2.<a name=305:8></a> I am not captive, sold under sin.<a name=305:9></a> My status and condition is exactly the opposite of chapter 7.<a name=305:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The question here is not if I act up to it -- of course I should -- but what is the status I am in?<a name=305:11></a> I am "not in the flesh," not in my Adam standing before God at all, but in Christ; "not in the flesh, but in the Spirit," redeemed into connection -- living connection -- according to the power of His resurrection, which is both the seal of redemption and the power of life with a risen Christ; and, besides that, I have received the Holy Ghost, that I may both know it (John 14) and have the power of it, the old man being condemned and dead; "for what the law could not do (chapter 7) in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh.<a name=305:12></a>" A new life is there in the power of the Spirit; but the old has been condemned in the death of Christ, so that there is no condemnation, and it died when condemned.<a name=305:13></a> I have death to sin, and no condemnation for it, through Christ's death.<a name=305:14></a> I need not, I trust, say here Christ had none.<a name=305:15></a> He could do that, being made sin for us, because He knew none.<a name=305:16></a> But sin in the flesh is condemned (yet so that there is no condemnation for me) but for faith is dead: my old man crucified with [Him], I am dead with Christ.<a name=305:17></a> The realisation of this in walk is found in 2 Corinthians 4: 10-12.<a name=305:18></a>

		I only add a notice of two false translations which theology has introduced, and for which there is no excuse.<a name=307:1></a> "The flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh, and these are contrary the one to the other" -- the opposition which I insist on, and which Dr.<a name=307:2></a> Stuart denies.<a name=307:3></a> But then comes the theology: "So that ye cannot do the things that ye would.<a name=307:4></a>" This is nonsense; for if I cannot do what the Spirit would, nor what the flesh would, I can do nothing.<a name=307:5></a> But it is used simply to mean, we cannot do what the Spirit would, shewing the practical state of souls.<a name=307:6></a> But there is no such statement; it is merely "that ye may not do" <i>(ina me)</i>.<a name=307:7></a> They seek to hinder the working of the contrary natures.<a name=307:8></a>

		The other is, "Sin is the transgression of the law.<a name=307:9></a>" This is really, I must say, a wicked subjection of the word to theology; The word <i>(anomia) is</i> never used for "transgression of the law" anywhere else in the English translation of the holy scriptures; another expression is, <i>parabasis nomou</i>.<a name=307:10></a> I call it "wicked," because by it a human system denies what the word of God carefully insists on.<a name=307:11></a> Not only so, but it is the word rightly translated elsewhere "without law.<a name=307:12></a>" Sin is not transgression of the law; to say so, universal as it may be, is a wicked anti-scriptural perversion.<a name=307:13></a> Sin is the evil nature which produces lust, the enmity of the heart against God.<a name=307:14></a> It is written, "Sin by the commandment became exceeding sinful," which could not be if sin was not there before the commandment.<a name=307:15></a> Again, the contrary is expressly stated.<a name=307:16></a> "Until the law sin was in the world.<a name=307:17></a>" There is no transgression without sin.<a name=307:18></a> Further, it is said, "They that have sinned without law," the same word as an adverb <i>(anomos)</i>, in contrast to sinning under the law.<a name=307:19></a> That is, the word of God puts it in direct contradiction to what this false translation does.<a name=307:20></a>

		SCRIPTURAL UNITY AND UNION
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My object is in no way to assail Dr.<a name=309:1></a> Stuart (of whose personal worth and piety, though myself unacquainted with him, I have no doubt) but to take up the true grounds of unity and union: points not only of great importance, but occupying the hearts and minds of Christians everywhere.<a name=309:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The desire of unity flows, I cannot doubt, from the Spirit of God.<a name=309:3></a> True unity and true union are from Him, and according to His mind.<a name=309:4></a> He will bring all things that are blessed around Himself as a moral centre.<a name=309:5></a> It evidently must be so, for He is God, and the true centre of all blessing.<a name=309:6></a> That according to this there is a special effectuation of this in Christ in the fulness of times, is clearly also revealed to us in scripture.<a name=309:7></a> Our question is: What, and of what, and how is this unity or union?<a name=309:8></a> How far is it unity, and how far union?<a name=309:9></a> These are not the same.<a name=309:10></a> Scripture must be our guide in the inquiry.<a name=309:11></a> And it is as precise as Dr.<a name=309:12></a> Stuart is vague.<a name=309:13></a> It reveals the purpose of God according to the good pleasure of His will, for the administration of the fulness of times, to gather together in one <i>(anakephalioasasthai)</i> all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are in earth.<a name=309:14></a> It reveals an eternal state when Christ shall have given up the kingdom to God, even the Father, that God may be all in all -- surely ever Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; but God as such all in all, not the subsistence of the kingdom held by Christ as man.<a name=309:15></a> As man the Son will then be subject, as we know He was on earth, though God over all blessed for ever, all the pleasure of the Godhead in Him bodily.<a name=309:16></a> I only add this to guard from error, as I have alluded to the passage in which His giving up of the kingdom and His subjection are spoken of.<a name=309:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another unity spoken of; that is, of saints on earth, and I may add in glory, and in a twofold way.<a name=309:18></a> First, as individual saints, a family I may call it, as it specially refers to the Father -- Christ being the first-born among many brethren.<a name=309:19></a> Of this John speaks; of the church as the body he never does.<a name=309:20></a> Its second aspect is this: -- those in whom the Spirit of God dwells are really united to Christ by the Holy Ghost, are members of His body, who, as man, is exalted to the right hand of God, in the glory He had with the Father before the world was.<a name=309:21></a> Both these will be perfected in heavenly places.<a name=309:22></a> The sons will be in glory conformed to the image of the Son.<a name=309:23></a> They have borne the image of the earthy; they will bear the image of the heavenly, made perfect in one.<a name=309:24></a> He will be the head of the body, the church, over all things.<a name=309:25></a>

		The passages I would refer to, some of which I shall be led to notice more fully, are John 17: 11; 20, 21; 22, 23: three distinct unities.<a name=310:6></a> Ephesians 1: 19-23.<a name=310:7></a> Compare Colossians 1: 15-18.<a name=310:8></a> The same twofold headship is in 1 Corinthians 15: 24-28; Ephesians 1: 9, 10; Romans 8: 29, 30.<a name=310:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am somewhat surprised, not at the sermon's producing an impression, but that its vague statements were not estimated more justly by those who sought its publication.<a name=310:10></a> I suppose want of scriptural habits of thought is what accounts for it.<a name=310:11></a> Its references to scripture are everywhere loose and inaccurate.<a name=310:12></a> The text itself connects part of verse 23 of John 17 with verse 21, leaving out verse 22, which makes a total change in the phase of unity treated of, and the effect of that in verse 24 is left out, or the discrepancy would be manifest.<a name=310:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are three unities spoken of in John 17.<a name=310:14></a> First is that of the immediate disciples of Christ.<a name=310:15></a> The application of this unity to them is incontrovertible, as is evident from the language of verse 12.<a name=310:16></a> The second (20, 21) is of those that believe through their word, "one in us," and this was to the intent that the world may believe.<a name=310:17></a> The third is unity in glory, the glory given to Christ Himself of the Father, when the saints are made perfect in one, that the world may know He was sent of Him, and, seeing them in the same glory as Christ, know (most wondrous word!<a name=310:18></a>) that we have been loved as He was loved.<a name=310:19></a> May our souls admire such grace, and know what it is to dwell in it.<a name=310:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Dr.<a name=310:21></a> Stuart omits the statement of their being in glory (verse 22), and connects the world's believing with their being made perfect in one.<a name=310:22></a> This is not the right way of dealing with scripture, and scripture so solemn and precious in its import as this is.<a name=310:23></a>

		He tells us further, "the union of the true believer to Christ is set forth in our text, and secured by the double bond of a mutual indwelling.<a name=311:1></a>" Now there is a mutual indwelling blessedly set forth in John 14 as known to saints when the Holy Ghost should be given, as He was on the day of Pentecost.<a name=311:2></a> But no union with Christ is spoken of in the text, nor indeed does John ever speak of it.<a name=311:3></a> It is another thought -- one which in his epistle he carries on to dwelling in God and God in us, known by the Spirit He has given.<a name=311:4></a> Perhaps it is even a more precious thought than union, if in such infinite and unspeakable privileges, conferred by grace -- of which, His grace, God will shew in the ages to come the unspeakable riches in His kindness towards us through Jesus Christ -- we can speak of more and less.<a name=311:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On this mutual indwelling of Christ and us Dr.<a name=311:6></a> Stuart insists much.<a name=311:7></a> There is not a word of it in John 17.<a name=311:8></a> The mutual indwelling of the Father and the Son is spoken of as "Thou Father art in Me, and I in Thee," but not so of Christ and the believer.<a name=311:9></a> Dr.<a name=311:10></a> Stuart has been misled by the sound of the words in "I in them, and Thou in Me"; but there is no mutual indwelling here at all.<a name=311:11></a> It is display in glory -- Christ in the saints, and the Father in Christ.<a name=311:12></a> The whole statement is a mistake.<a name=311:13></a> We have only to read the passage to see it; and in privileges so wondrous, and thoughts so deep, it behoves us to keep close to scripture.<a name=311:14></a> If we do not, we shall lose much, following our own thoughts.<a name=311:15></a> I cannot doubt that so excellent a person as Dr.<a name=311:16></a> Stuart has done so here in giving course to his own thoughts, instead of cleaving close to the word.<a name=311:17></a>

		I do not dwell much on the "oneness of evil.<a name=311:18></a>" There is a oneness in evil in one sense.<a name=311:19></a> It is in man self-will departed from God, and enmity against Him, whatever its form, lawless lust, transgression of the law, and hating Christ, and therein His Father.<a name=311:20></a> Still the statements of Dr.<a name=311:21></a> Stuart seemed to me to hang little together.<a name=311:22></a> "The oneness of evil is among the most marked of its characteristics," yet "sin and unity are everlasting opposites.<a name=311:23></a>" However, as my object is not to criticise, but to treat the subject of true unity, and there are important moral observations in the remarks of Dr.<a name=311:24></a> Stuart on the oneness of evil, I do not comment on it farther.<a name=311:25></a>

		Christ assuredly was, as born into this world and ever, holy, harmless, undefiled; but it shews the habitual confusion of thought as to Christ, if we remember that this is spoken of Christ as High Priest (Hebrews 7) and carefully presented as separate from sinners, in contrast too, with high priests "taken from among men.<a name=317:8></a>" When scripture speaks of His taking flesh, a vital truth for us as I have already said, not only is it said "a body hast Thou prepared me": but in stating His doing so, the language is careful not to speak as Dr.<a name=317:9></a> Stuart speaks.<a name=317:10></a> The children <i>kekoinoneke</i> of flesh and blood of Him; <i>metesche paraplesios is</i> used.<a name=317:11></a>

		SHORT INTRODUCTION TO ROMANS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Epistle to the Romans, though not the highest in its character of truth, more comprehensively than any other sets forth God's glad tidings, and this with a method and depth which attest not merely the style of Paul but the wisdom of the Holy Spirit who inspired the great apostle of the Gentiles.<a name=329:1></a> His Son (for so the apostle preached Him from the first, Acts 9: 20) is the object of faith, come of David's seed according to flesh, marked out Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by resurrection of the dead.<a name=329:2></a> Thus the connection with the Old Testament is maintained, while the way is open for a new order of things through resurrection wherein guilt was removed, sin judged, and life manifested victorious over the enemy in his last stronghold of death, yea, with a title superior to God's eternal judgment.<a name=329:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, after presenting himself suitably as apostle by call to those called at Rome, he testifies his thanks for their faith, and his great desire to see them, whatever the hindrances till then, for their mutual refreshment.<a name=329:4></a> He desired fruit there as elsewhere, being debtor to all.<a name=329:5></a> He was not ashamed of the gospel (or glad tidings): it is God's power to salvation to every believer, because divine righteousness is revealed in it by faith to faith, as the prophet declared in a dark day for Israel.<a name=329:6></a> Thus, if the Son is the object of faith, the believer has part in God's righteousness.<a name=329:7></a><a href="#329:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> Man had no righteousness for God, who reveals His to man; and hence it is a question of believing.<a name=329:8></a> For His wrath is revealed from heaven against all impiety and unrighteousness of men holding the truth in unrighteousness: the one embracing every shade of heathenism or ungodliness; the other especially Jews or, as we can now add, Christendom.<a name=329:9></a> How deep the need, how grave the danger, of sinful man!<a name=329:10></a>

		To the end of chapter 1 the Gentiles are convicted of their impiety in a brief but appalling sketch, confirmed too truly by all that remains of antiquity, utterly depraved not only by their lusts and passions but yet more by their idolatry which sanctioned, yea provoked and even consecrated, their worst evils.<a name=329:11></a> It will be observed therefore that the apostle does not trace the ruin to the beginning of the world, but only since the flood when men inexcusably slighted the testimony of creation, and, knowing God, glorified Him not as God, but professing to be wise became fools, and setting up idols were given up by the one true God above them, whom they would not serve, to become slaves of every vileness below them.<a name=329:12></a>

		The opening of chapter 2 looks at the moralists, at men, Gentiles or Jews, who speculated on good but were a prey like others to the wickedness they condemned, despising the riches of God's goodness as they forgot His judgment, with whom is no respect of persons, those who sin without law perishing also without it, and those who sin in it to be judged by it in the day when God judges the secrets of men, according to the apostle's gospel, by Jesus Christ.<a name=330:1></a> Here he names the "Jew first" and the "Greek" in judgment, as before in the administration of the gospel.<a name=330:2></a> For judgment takes account of all things, and hence of superior advantages, each giving account according to his light and receiving according to his deeds.<a name=330:3></a> For salvation is according to grace, reward or judgment according to works.<a name=330:4></a> Thus both tests are applied, what they fell from, and what God will bring in at Christ's coming and kingdom.<a name=330:5></a> And as wrath revealed from heaven stood in contrast on God's side with earthly judgments in providence, so here on man's side does the judgment of the secrets of the heart.<a name=330:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Jews are then distinctively and expressly brought forward, who with better light were no better morally, for the name of God was blasphemed on their account.<a name=330:7></a> So far is circumcision from availing them against their base inconsistencies that it becomes contrariwise uncircumcision; even as uncircumcision keeping the requirements of the law should be reckoned for circumcision, judging such as with letter and uncircumcision transgressed law.<a name=330:8></a> Sin is shewn to be the great leveller, as righteousness does not fail to exalt.<a name=330:9></a> A transgressing Jew was as bad as, indeed worse than, a Gentile; a Gentile who wrought righteousness no less acceptable than a Jew.<a name=330:10></a> God will have moral reality; and this, wherever found, alone secures His praise.<a name=330:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This raised the question, in chapter 3, of the superiority of the Jew, or of the profit of circumcision.<a name=330:12></a> The apostle allows it in every way, and first in being entrusted with the oracles of God.<a name=330:13></a> But man's unfaithfulness in no way hinders the certainty or the justice of God's judging the world.<a name=330:14></a> Nor do outward privileges in any wise suppose or secure a better condition, though aggravating responsibility.<a name=330:15></a> And the fact that, what the law or Old Testament says, it speaks to those under it (that is, to the Jews), totally convicts them; for it declares in the plainest terms that there is none righteous, none that understandeth, none that doeth good, all gone out of the way, and no fear of God before their eyes.<a name=330:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Law therefore cannot help Israel, still less a Gentile.<a name=331:6></a> What is the resource then?<a name=331:7></a> The apostle returns to the thesis which preceded his reasoning, and, with so much the more evidence of its urgent necessity, affirms that now apart from law God's righteousness is manifested.<a name=331:8></a> A truly wonderful statement, in which we have the relation of the gospel to the Old Testament, its universal direction, and its application in fact as being contingent on faith, while it meets all on the ground of sheer ruin and so of pure grace.<a name=331:9></a> It proclaims the work of the Lord which answers to the mercy-seat with the atoning blood of Jehovah's lot sprinkled on and before it, thus laying a righteous ground both to justify the forbearance of God in dealing with the saints of old or their sins in past times, and to display now that God is just, while He justifies him that believes in Jesus.<a name=331:10></a> By faith boasting is thus excluded, and God is shewn to be the God who justifies both Jew and Gentile while law itself is established instead of being made void.<a name=331:11></a>

		There is nothing to hinder our understanding <i>dikaiosune Theou</i> in its usual sense of an attribute or quality of God, because it is also <i>dikaiosune ek pisteos</i>, for indeed it is revealed in the gospel for us to believe, and therefore we could profit by it on no other principle.<a name=331:12></a> It is of course <i>choris nomou</i>, "apart from law" (Romans 3: 21), which, if obeyed, would have been man's, not God's, righteousness.<a name=331:13></a> The <i>dorea</i> or free giving of righteousness (Romans 5: 17) is perfectly consistent with this: God's grace was the source of this gift; it was no question of one's work or fitness as under law.<a name=331:14></a> So Romans 10: 3, Philippians 3: 9, are both thoroughly in harmony with the fact that the apostle speaks of divine righteousness, or God's consistency with Himself in justifying the believer through the redemption that is in Christ.<a name=331:15></a> Undoubtedly it is a righteousness of which He is the author (as Philippians 3: 9 teaches), and which He approves; but it is below the mark merely to say this.<a name=331:16></a> For if man be imagined to have obeyed the law, it would have been a righteousness available before God; and man would have lived instead of dying.<a name=331:17></a> But this would have been neither eternal life in the Son, nor God's righteousness, but man's.<a name=331:18></a> Hence the definition of Luther, Calvin, Beza, Reiche, De Wette, etc.<a name=331:19></a>, is unsatisfactory, as Luther's version, which is a paraphrase expressive of it, is erroneous.<a name=331:20></a> A righteousness which God might give or approve need not be His own, which the apostle over and over declares it to be.<a name=331:21></a> Of course it is not divine justice abstractly (which is perhaps the unconscious difficulty of most who approach the subject), but God just in virtue of the Saviour's work.<a name=331:22></a> How does He estimate it, how act on it, for the believer?<a name=331:23></a> The infusion of divine righteousness has no just sense, or it appears to confound justification with life; whilst the idea that it means mercy is a poor evasion which weakens the grand truth that not His love only, but His justice justifies the believer in Jesus.<a name=331:24></a><a name=332>[Page 332]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The remarkable fact may here be noticed that confessedly the majority of commentators, who shrink from the plain meaning of the phrase in Philippians 1: 17, and even in chapter 3: 21, 22, confess that in verses 25, 26, it does signify, not God's mercy, nor His method of justification, or act of justifying (which in Greek is expressed by <i>dikaiosis)</i>, nor that righteousness which is acceptable to God, but His justice.<a name=332:1></a> Here this is allowed to be the proper meaning of the terms, and what the context demands.<a name=332:2></a> Not merely did justice seem compromised by pretermission of past sins, and therefore require vindication, but the work of Christ had so glorified God in the judgment of sin that it was only just for God to remit sins, yea, to justify him that is of faith in Christ Jesus.<a name=332:3></a> And so, it cannot be denied, the apostle but explains what he means by <i>dikaiosune Theou</i>, when he adds that God set forth Christ a propitiatory, or mercy-seat, that He might be just and justify the believer.<a name=332:4></a>

		If then it be so, that <i>dikaiosune Theou</i> can only mean God's righteousness where it is fully expounded (as in verses 25, 26), how unreasonable to give the same phrase a different force in the same context!<a name=333:1></a> (Verses 21, 22, just before.<a name=333:2></a>) If this be owned, with what consistency can one question its meaning in chapter 1: 17?<a name=333:3></a> Even chapter 3: 5 makes this apparent, for there beyond controversy the phrase means the consistency of God with His character (that is, His righteousness) in judging the world which rejects Christ, as the other passages shew His righteousness in justifying those who believe in His name.<a name=333:4></a> Compare also Matthew 6: 33, James 1: 20.<a name=333:5></a> Elsewhere (save in 2 Corinthians 5: 21, which stands alone in using the abstract for concrete, but otherwise strengthens the same truth) the terms in the Epistles of Paul signify God's justice in justifying those who, resting by faith on Jesus and His blood, are accepted in all the value of His acceptance before God.<a name=333:6></a>

		Chapter 4 confirms the principle of faith for justification by the example of Abraham, backed up by David's testimony in Psalm 32; and this before the law or even circumcision.<a name=333:7></a> Thus, if the Jews contended for the inheritance by law or ordinances, they must shut him out who had it by promise, and therefore by faith: if they were his children really, they must receive all from God on a ground that ensures the promise to all the seed, Gentile no less than Jewish; and the rather, as in his case and Sarah's they were as good as dead, and their accomplishing of the promise out of the question, that God alone might be looked to as able to quicken the dead; just as we, Christians, believe, not here simply on Jesus, but on Him that raised from among the dead Jesus our Lord, who was delivered for our offences and raised for our justification.<a name=333:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The consequences of being thus justified by faith are stated in the first half of chapter 5: peace with God, His actual grace or favour, and the hope of His glory in which we boast; nor in this only, but in tribulations because of their effect experimentally; yea, finally, boasting in God through our Lord Jesus Christ through whom now we have received the reconciliation.<a name=333:9></a>

		But the work of Christ goes much farther than the remission of sins or the display of divine love to us in view of guilt, however important it is that we begin with this.<a name=333:10></a> Pardon refers to our sins which must otherwise be dealt with in the day of judgment; but there rises also the question of our nature or actual state, not merely of our bad works, but of the sin that produced them.<a name=333:11></a> Here it is not personal guilt, nor Jews and Gentiles convicted as before, but the race with its head, and the sin which came in by that one man, though each also has his own sins.<a name=333:12></a> This clearly brings us up to Adam, though (thank God) also in presence of Christ, the law which came in meanwhile and by the bye only shaping sins into offences and causing them to abound.<a name=333:13></a> Now, if a single man righteously involved all his family in sin and death, who can dispute the righteous title of God that the grace of another man, Christ, should abound to His family for eternal life?<a name=333:14></a> Such is the argument from chapter 5: 12.<a name=333:15></a>

		If grace be so rich in every way and for ever, should we continue in sin that grace may abound?<a name=334:1></a> It is a denial in effect of Christianity: so we learn in chapter 6.<a name=334:2></a> We that die to sin, how shall we longer live in it?<a name=334:3></a> We were buried with Christ by baptism unto death, that we should walk in newness of life.<a name=334:4></a> Our old man was crucified together that the body of sin might be annulled, that we should no longer serve sin.<a name=334:5></a> For he that died is justified from sin.<a name=334:6></a> Thus we are to reckon ourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.<a name=334:7></a> Sin shall not have dominion, for we are not under law but under grace.<a name=334:8></a> Shall we sin then because we are thus?<a name=334:9></a> Certainly not.<a name=334:10></a> We were slaves of sin, but now, freed from it, we have become slaves of righteousness and of God, have our fruit unto holiness, and the end, worthy of His grace, eternal life.<a name=334:11></a>

		Chapter 7 handles the question of freedom from the law, as it was already shewn that grace strengthens against sin, instead of making it a light or open matter.<a name=334:12></a> The married woman is bound by law to her husband as long as he is alive: death severs this bond.<a name=334:13></a> So are we made dead to the law by the body of Christ, that we should belong to another who has been raised from among the dead in order that we might bear fruit to God.<a name=334:14></a> We were in the flesh, but now are cleared from the law, being dead to that wherein we were held, so that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in oldness of letter.<a name=334:15></a> Observe however that it is not by abrogation of the law but by our death to it that grace acts.<a name=334:16></a>

		Not that the law is sin, but sin, getting an occasion or point of attack by the commandment, works every lust, deceives, slays, and also becomes exceeding sinful.<a name=334:17></a> But though renewed, the person finds himself without strength, discerns evil in his nature as distinct from himself, delights in the law of God yet sees another law in his members bringing him into captivity, and so learns in conscious wretchedness the value of Christ for deliverance no less than pardon, though this in no way alters the two natures.<a name=334:18></a>

		Chapter 8 closes the discussion with the fullest statement of the results of Christ's work in death and resurrection for the Christian.<a name=335:1></a> Three divisions present themselves: first, the deliverance pursued even to the raising of the mortal body, the Spirit being regarded as characterizing that life and state; secondly, the relations of the Holy Ghost to the Christian as acting in, with, and on him in power and person; and, thirdly, God for us in the face of every trying experience and all hostility from the creature, fully and triumphantly securing us.<a name=335:2></a>

		First, what a status for those in Christ!<a name=335:3></a> The necessary action of their new nature, the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus, bespeaks their deliverance from the law of sin and death; as again God has already condemned in the cross sin in the flesh, not merely in its outbreak, that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.<a name=335:4></a> For there are persons characterized by each in life and character, the mind of the one death, of the other life and peace; and this, because the mind of the flesh is enmity against God, and they that are in it cannot please Him, while Christians are not in it, but in Spirit, and so, Christ being in them, they hold the body as dead on account of sin, as the Spirit is life on account of righteousness.<a name=335:5></a> But even their mortal bodies will be raised on account of His Spirit that dwells in them.<a name=335:6></a> Secondly, the Spirit is a Spirit of sonship and an earnest of the glory that is coming, and we meanwhile groan by the Spirit, and God thus finds the mind of the Spirit, not selfishness, in us, while He makes all work for good.<a name=335:7></a> Thirdly, along with God's purpose of conforming us to the image of His Son in glory, we have divine power assuring us; so that, come what will, nothing shall separate from His love which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.<a name=335:8></a>

		In chapter 9 the apostle shews that not he, but the Jews, could be more justly censured for making light of the peculiar privileges of Israel; as in truth he loved them quite as fervently as Moses.<a name=335:10></a> It was a question of God's call in Isaac.<a name=335:11></a> Nay, more, we see fleshly right still more manifestly excluded by the blessing of Jacob in disparagement of Esau, and this before the birth of the twins.<a name=335:12></a> It is a question thus of sovereign grace.<a name=335:13></a> Did they then complain of God's unrighteousness?<a name=335:14></a> It was all for Israel, that sovereignty of God: else what had become of them ruined before the golden calf at Sinai, had not God said, "I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy"?<a name=335:15></a> On the other hand, Pharaoh is the witness of His hardening and judgments.<a name=335:16></a> Does man yet find fault because God acts as He will?<a name=335:17></a> This is met by asserting God's title to judge man, and rebuking man's pretension to judge God.<a name=335:18></a> He has power; but how does He use it?<a name=335:19></a> With the utmost long-suffering toward the vessels of wrath, and in the richest mercy to its vessels, the latter being in themselves no better than the former.<a name=335:20></a> Thus mercy calls Gentiles who had no privileges and Jews who had lost all.<a name=335:21></a> Hosea and Isaiah, more than once, confirm all, shewing not only Gentiles called but Israel stumbling at the stumbling-stone laid in Zion, while faith only would not be ashamed.<a name=335:22></a>

		Chapter 11 proves that the rejection of Israel is neither complete nor final, corroborated by the olive tree which lets us see the cutting off that awaits unfaithful Christendom no less surely than what befell the Jew, but that the Redeemer would yet come out of Zion turning away ungodliness from Jacob, and so all Israel be saved, coming in at length as an object of mercy no less than a Gentile.<a name=336:7></a> This drew out the transports of the apostle, as he thought of the depth of the riches of God's wisdom and knowledge.<a name=336:8></a>

		Chapter 13 exhibits the relation of the saints to outward government in the world; subjection to what is thus set up of God, whatever it be, in the world, so that to oppose the authority is to resist His ordinance, on account not only of wrath but of conscience also; and on this account paying tribute and to all their dues, owing no man anything but love, the fulfilment of the law.<a name=337:5></a> And this too, urged the more by the nearness of the day, in the light of which we should walk, remembering that the night is far spent, and not gratifying flesh which loves the dark.<a name=337:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in chapter 14 follows the duty of brotherly forbearance, rendered at Rome in those days the more incumbent because of so many Jews and Gentiles meeting together there as Christians.<a name=337:7></a> The weak, as they are called, who were burdened with scruples, were not to judge the strong, who knew their liberty; neither were the strong to despise the weak.<a name=337:8></a> Conscience must be respected; Christ is Lord of dead and living; and to God every one of us must give account.<a name=337:9></a> Rather let one judge to put no stumbling-block in a brother's way, nor thus for meat destroy him for whom Christ died.<a name=337:10></a> Peace and edification should be sought, but also a good conscience, for whatever is not of faith is sin.<a name=337:11></a> The beginning of chapter 15 concludes this question with Him who pleased not Himself, but bore the reproaches men cast on God, thus entitling the Christian to all the comfort of the scriptures which speak of Christ, and strengthening us to receive one another, as Christ did, to God's glory.<a name=337:12></a>

		Next we have, from verse 8, a statement of God's ways in the gospel justified by the Old Testament, and of his own ministry among us Gentiles, as a reason for thus exhorting them, though giving them credit for goodness and knowledge and ability to admonish one another.<a name=337:13></a> From Jerusalem and in a circle round to Illyricum he had fully preached the gospel and so aiming, not where Christ was named, but where they had not heard of Him; and, now that his work was done in the East, his old and strong desire to visit the West, after a deacon's service for the poor of the saints in Jerusalem (for nothing comes amiss to love), revives the hope to see the Roman saints on his way to Spain.<a name=337:14></a> But God had plans of His own; and if Paul was not saved from unbelieving brethren after the flesh in Judea, it was but to give him more the fellowship of Christ's sufferings who was delivered to the Gentiles by the Jews.<a name=337:15></a>

		The whole question of our actual guilt has been settled, but our state has not been touched.<a name=342:1></a> The apostle shews that it was not a mere question of law but of sin, and so applied to man and not merely to the Jew; for sin was there from Adam to Moses, when law was not, and death proved it.<a name=342:2></a> Thus the rest is traced up to Adam, and it is shewn that grace must be of as wide an application; and Christ refers to all, to Gentile as well as to Jew.<a name=342:3></a> Chapters 3: 20 to 5: 11, inclusive, treat then the question of sins; chapters 5: 12 to the end of chapter 8 that of sin, and our condition through the disobedience of Adam and the obedience of Christ.<a name=342:4></a> If it be a question of sins, each has his own; if of sin, we are all one lump.<a name=342:5></a> This is the ground taken from chapter 5: 12, though of course the sins come in as fruit.<a name=342:6></a> Hence justification is not seen as justification from sins but sin, and our living place in Christ -- "justification of life.<a name=342:7></a>" We are constituted righteous, and it goes to a fuller presentation even of this truth: "There is no condemnation.<a name=342:8></a>" Nothing of the sort can apply to one who is <i>in Christ</i>.<a name=342:9></a>

		This, let me remark in passing, has a very full character; for Christ in the sense of personal walk and perfectness always lived to God; but while down here had always to deal with sin, to be tempted, to be exercised in obedience, and keep His feet from the paths of the destroyer; and, finally, knowing no sin, to be made sin for us.<a name=342:21></a> All testing and trial only brought out His perfectness; still He had to do with it, live above it, not let in what would have been sin and disobedience, or want of absolute obedience.<a name=342:22></a> Blessed be God, we know He did not and could not fail; nor was there the smallest answer or movement in Him to answer to incessant temptations from without; but He lived in the sphere in which He was moving, as the air around Him, and died to it.<a name=342:23></a> Now <i>in that He lives</i>, He lives to God.<a name=342:24></a> All that He had to do with sin in this world was to <i>die</i> to sin.<a name=342:25></a> He died and suffered rather than not accomplish absolute obedience to, and glorify, His Father.<a name=342:26></a> But now as man, God is the one sole object filling, satisfying, occupying the life in which He lives.<a name=342:27></a> There is no other object to claim its movements, no movements which turn towards anything else.<a name=342:28></a> "<i>In that he liveth</i>, he liveth unto God.<a name=342:29></a>"

		So we reckon ourselves dead to sin as crucified with Him, and alive only to God -- a wondrous word.<a name=343:1></a> Our old man is crucified with Him, for the destroying the body of sin; and if I am alive at all, it is through Jesus Christ our Lord, and so alive to God.<a name=343:2></a> Life has no other object nor produce of thought and feeling.<a name=343:3></a> Hence I have not to serve sin.<a name=343:4></a> He does not say continue in it (this supposes life of and from it, that is, pure flesh), but not to serve or submit to it as a master even: a different thing, and which more directly concerns the Christian.<a name=343:5></a> And I have a right to speak, for it shall not have dominion over me as if I was under law (in which case it would, even if I hated it), but under grace.<a name=343:6></a> Thus I am set free, and in a happy and good sense my own master.<a name=343:7></a> Whom am I going to serve, to whom yield myself?<a name=343:8></a> To God, and my members as instruments -- that is, all they are now -- of righteousness to God.<a name=343:9></a> It is an absolute <i>yielding ourselves up</i> to God.<a name=343:10></a> Blessed privilege!<a name=343:11></a> And here I get fruit; in the slavery of sin, none: only it ended in death (guilt and judgment are not the subject here, but state); but now I have fruit unto holiness; walking in obedient righteousness, I learn God, His ways; I have fruit in separatedness and affections of heart to Him.<a name=343:12></a> So Moses says, "If I have found grace in thy sight, shew me thy way, that I may know thee, and that I may find grace in thy sight.<a name=343:13></a>" There is added one word which brings all back to grace, lest living to God might be wrongfully reckoned to man.<a name=343:14></a> "The <i>wages</i> of sin is death; but the <i>gift</i> of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=343:15></a>" But it is a blessed thing to be allowed to yield ourselves to God: so did Jesus; so in His life are we privileged to do.<a name=343:16></a>

		Chapter 7, as often studied and commented on, applies this principle of death to law.<a name=344:1></a> The law has power over a man as long as he lives.<a name=344:2></a> But we have died in Christ; the bond with our first husband, if we have been under law (and being born of God, without the knowledge of redemption, put us under it in spirit, a state described at the end of the chapter), is dissolved by our death, and we are to another, Christ raised from the dead.<a name=344:3></a> We have therefore, besides death and a new life, the bond of relationship in which we are, wholly to Christ and no longer to the law to which we have died.<a name=344:4></a>

		THOUGHTS ON ROMANS, COLOSSIANS, EPHESIANS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two great subjects treated of in scripture in connection with man's relationship with God -- purpose in God, and responsibility in man.<a name=347:1></a> The former is in the second Man, the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God.<a name=347:2></a> This purpose was established before the foundation of the world.<a name=347:3></a> (See 2 Timothy 1: 9, 10; Titus 1: 2, 3; Proverbs 8; 1 Corinthians 2: 7.<a name=347:4></a>) Many passages refer to details of this.<a name=347:5></a> Ephesians especially fully develops it.<a name=347:6></a> But God did not begin with this, nor with the second Adam in whom these promises were to be accomplished, but with the first, placed in responsibility before God and in blessings dependent on faithfulness in his position.<a name=347:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christianity begins when this question of responsibility is closed.<a name=347:8></a> I do not mean, of course, that Christians are not responsible.<a name=347:9></a> But their responsibility is that of children of God, redeemed by grace from the condition of ruin in which man was fallen.<a name=347:10></a> Individuals withal have to pass through in their own souls experimentally the results of this condition of responsibility; but in Christianity it is not to ascertain whether they can meet judgment, but to arrive at the clear discovery that they cannot, that they are guilty and lost; to have judgment realised in their consciences that "there is none righteous, no, not one" (every mouth being stopped, and all the world guilty before God); that they cannot themselves get out of this condition, but that Christ came to seek and to save that which was lost; that "when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.<a name=347:11></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not now enter into the details of this redemption, nor of what the purpose connected with it is.<a name=347:12></a> I only refer to it now to shew that it is when the divine development as to the first man's responsibility is closed, and man viewed as guilty and lost under it, that Christianity begins.<a name=347:13></a> The question of responsibility was gone through in the first Adam.<a name=347:14></a> First, he failed being innocent; then displayed his lawlessness in corruption and violence, bringing in the flood; then under law broke it; and when (all this being already true) God came into the world in goodness, the full character of sin was developed in enmity against God by the rejection of the blessed Lord.<a name=347:15></a> This closed the probation of man.<a name=347:16></a> Now, says the Lord, is the judgment of this world.<a name=347:17></a> Hence we read, "He appeared once in the end of the world (the consummation of ages), to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself," and "these things .<a name=347:18></a>.<a name=347:19></a>.<a name=347:20></a> are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.<a name=347:21></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=348>[Page 348]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christianity then comes when the question of man's standing in responsibility is closed, not only as being a sinner, but when God having tried all means of recovery saying, "I have yet one Son," had tried them in vain as regards the discovery of good in the first Adam, or his recovery as such.<a name=348:1></a> He is already guilty and lost, and proved so.<a name=348:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Besides his state of innocence, inalienable life for ever and responsibility were attached to the two trees in the garden; but man took the wrong road in connection with responsibility, and forfeited life.<a name=348:3></a> In the law the question was again raised as to both; but satisfying responsibility was put before life.<a name=348:4></a> "This do and thou shalt live.<a name=348:5></a>" Christ meets our responsibility in bearing the consequence of it, our sins, and, being made sin in that place, perfectly glorified God, and becomes our life (of which more hereafter).<a name=348:6></a> Thus and thus only the two are reconciled for sinful man -- life and responsibility.<a name=348:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, from the beginning, the coming of Christ was intimated in the judgment pronounced on Satan; and then, when God began to deal with man in the new world when it had wholly departed from Him into idolatry, in the promise of the Seed in whom the nations should be blessed, to Abraham called out from it.<a name=348:8></a> But the promise was never fulfilled till Christ came; and He being rejected, though the promised Seed had come, the result of purpose was not fulfilled; but the ground of it was laid according to grace abounding over sin, and in righteousness, Christ having perfectly glorified God as made sin, and gone as Man into glory according to divine righteousness, so that man's being there was the demonstration of righteousness.<a name=348:9></a> Thus propitiation for sins was made, which met the responsibility, and the ground laid for the accomplishment of purpose, and then the Holy Ghost comes down on earth, the witness of these things, and the present power of that Christianity in which through grace we enjoy them.<a name=348:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence we have the responsibility and state owned and demonstrated, and man met in it in grace; and the purpose revealed and ourselves associated with Christ in it; but the old creation and the first Adam state judged and lying in wickedness and alienation from God; and the new creation, connected with the Second Adam, raised and glorified, revealed; while as to life we are brought into it, with the Holy Ghost dwelling in us.<a name=348:11></a>

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=349>[Page 349]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the Gospels give us Christ come into the old creation, and in diverse characters, His passing into death as so coming; and all give the resurrection, which is the essential beginning of the new as to man in every respect, for example, life and acceptance; not all, His ascension.<a name=349:1></a> There is this difference in them, that while the three first (Matthew, Mark, and Luke) give us His rejection historically, and in prophetic testimony, more or less, what was to take the place of His presence; in the first (Matthew) as Man, and according to promise, that is, in the first creation, and in Israel; the last of the four (John), being the revelation of His Person, that the Word was God, precedes all dispensation and creation itself, and begins by the world He had created not knowing Him, and His own rejecting Him, and then unfolds His Person, and what was proper to Himself and His service and the coming of the Holy Ghost when He had gone to the Father.<a name=349:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All this is assumed in the Epistles, and in Paul's and John's our being in the ascended Christ; in Paul's also the doctrine of the "assembly," and the purposes connected with it.<a name=349:3></a> This leads me to our immediate subject.<a name=349:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul, in the Epistle to the Romans, does not enter on the ground of the new creation, but treats of man on this earth as a responsible being, only in one word as an abstract doctrine shewing him as he will be, and that only personally: "Whom he justified, them he also glorified.<a name=349:5></a>" Here alone (chapter 8) <i>purpose</i> comes in, but only as to the state of individuals.<a name=349:6></a> God's sovereignty is asserted in chapter 9, but only to give God title to let in the Gentiles, in contrast with a national election claimed by the Jews.<a name=349:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the purposes of God, or the new creation which is in purpose, are not in view.<a name=349:8></a> Man is a responsible creature in this world, dealt with as such, though in the end glorified.<a name=349:9></a> This responsibility is met by the work of Christ, and the coincident fact of having life in Him.<a name=349:10></a> With this the great fact of present Christianity is recognised -- the Holy Ghost down here.<a name=349:11></a> By this we know that we are in Christ, but as down here.<a name=349:12></a> It is the believer's state down here in virtue of the Holy Ghost coming here.<a name=349:13></a> He sheds the love of God abroad in our hearts; but all this is my state down here, not the new creation.<a name=349:14></a> Its being so indeed gives it such value, though from other scriptures I know all this involves a part in the new creation.<a name=349:15></a> But I am saved in hope, I rejoice in hope of the glory, I am a joint-heir with Christ as a son; but my present place is suffering with Him.<a name=349:16></a> Though promising thus personally the glory, likeness to Christ according to the purpose of God, the Epistle treats the question of the divine ground of righteousness and the standing of a Christian in this world through the removal of sin.<a name=349:17></a> This it does in a double way, having respect first to the <i>conduct</i>, and then to the <i>state</i> of man as a child of Adam.<a name=349:18></a> Romans 1: 18 to chapter 5: 11 treats of his conduct, and the perfect grace that has met his case.<a name=349:19></a> Every mouth is stopped, and all the world guilty before God.<a name=349:20></a> But God has set Christ forth a propitiation, through faith in His blood, whether for remission of past sins (as to which God had shewn His forbearance in the times passed before Christ's work); or now to justify him that believes in Jesus.<a name=349:21></a> "He was delivered for our offences, and raised again for our justification.<a name=349:22></a>" So that by faith we have peace with God, stand in present favour, and rejoice in hope of the glory; yea, rejoice in tribulation as working good; yea, joy in God Himself through Christ, through whom we have thus received a perfect reconciliation.<a name=349:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=350>[Page 350]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in all this, through knowing God's love by the Holy Ghost given to us, we have our personal standing before God here; it is not new creation, though the life we have belongs to it.<a name=350:1></a> But the Epistle meets the whole question of our personal relationship to God.<a name=350:2></a> First, Christ is a propitiation through faith in His blood, and being risen again, the ground of our justification is shewn to be perfect, and being justified by faith we have peace with God.<a name=350:3></a> God imputes no sin to the believer, Christ having been delivered for our offences, and raised again for our justification.<a name=350:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, from chapter 5: 12, the apostle takes up our state.<a name=350:5></a> Adam, by his obedience, has brought all connected with him into the condition of sinners; Christ, by His obedience, all connected with Him into that of righteousness.<a name=350:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But with this another truth is connected.<a name=350:7></a> If it be by one Man's obedience, we may live on as we like and be righteous by Christ's obedience, says the world.<a name=350:8></a> But I have this righteousness by having part in His death; the having part in it is the very profession of Christianity; but death is not living on!<a name=350:9></a> Thus delivery from the state and power of sin is by death, and our death is in the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=350:10></a> The Romans, even in the first part, recognises the Christian's personal state on earth; the Holy Ghost is given to us, we are in Christ, live in Christ.<a name=350:11></a> The assembly itself also is assumed in the hortatory part; chapter 12.<a name=350:12></a> What is treated of, this state being assumed, is the divine way of grace as to it.<a name=350:13></a> Meeting our responsibility by bearing our sins I have already spoken of.<a name=350:14></a> The second part treats, we have seen, of our state.<a name=350:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=351>[Page 351]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But if we are alive in Christ, and Christ is in us, it is Christ who is risen and even is glorified, after having died.<a name=351:1></a> Such a Christ being our life, we are esteemed dead, for He who is our life, our true I, has died, and this is valid and effectual for faith.<a name=351:2></a> It is the profession of our common Christianity: we are baptized to it.<a name=351:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in its effect (save the statement in chapter 8 of the effect of God's being for us) this is not pursued beyond death; so that, Christ risen being our life, we are set free.<a name=351:4></a> "If Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin, and the Spirit is life, because of righteousness.<a name=351:5></a>" Christ is looked at as our life, but we are not viewed as risen with Him.<a name=351:6></a> He has been a propitiatory victim, and delivered for our offences, and died to sin once, all alone.<a name=351:7></a> He is not looked at as gone down into our place, and Himself and we raised up together.<a name=351:8></a> In this case He is not life to us, but a dead Man raised up, and this involves not merely life in Him but a new estate into which He is entered, and involves a new creation, though it may be and is considered apart.<a name=351:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in fact He has died to this creation, and been raised to be, as Man, head of the new creation, and head of the body.<a name=351:10></a> There is, however, in the teaching of Romans deliverance, for He has died.<a name=351:11></a> Hence, not only we live in Him, but "our old man is crucified with him," but we are still alive in this world with Christ's life -- "the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus"; but dead to sin in it, and to the law.<a name=351:12></a> Risen <i>with</i> Christ <i>involves</i> the purposes of God, Christ being viewed as the object of those purposes, and the power which brings them about; and hence we are associated with Him in them, and hence it leads on to our union in the church with Him.<a name=351:13></a> Not but that Christ is viewed as risen in the Epistle to the Romans: we find it thus in the first part, where it is applied to our justification, our clearance from guilt.<a name=351:14></a> But this is the acceptance of the victim; if not risen, I am yet in my sins.<a name=351:15></a>, In the second, we are stated "to be (married) to another," even Christ, that is raised from the dead.<a name=351:16></a> But we are not raised with Him.<a name=351:17></a> This introduces by the power of God at the next step into the new creation, as a state of things, and into the assembly.<a name=351:18></a> Christ, our life, or living in Him, is another thing from Christ viewed as a dead man raised, yet it is a risen man who is our life.<a name=351:19></a>

		This death is then applied to the question of the law.<a name=353:1></a> Now the law has dominion over a man as long as he lives.<a name=353:2></a> But we have died, and consequently have ceased to be under it.<a name=353:3></a> We are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that we should be to another, even to Him who is raised from the dead.<a name=353:4></a> Still we are looked at as here, but married to Christ, who is raised, but not we raised with Him.<a name=353:5></a> We are delivered from the law, having died in that in which we were held.<a name=353:6></a> And then the state of the renewed soul under the first husband is given at the end of the chapter, where our death in Christ is not known; not the power of life in Him who is raised, and the presence of the Holy Ghost in us giving energy according to Christ's place to this life; chapter 7.<a name=353:7></a>

		Then the whole truth is summed up in the first three verses of chapter 8, the effect on the walk of the man down here in verse 4, which is man's responsibility as such, but the spring and power of the walk quite different, as are its effects (end of verses 4 and 5), with the judgment of man's condition when in the flesh.<a name=353:8></a>

		But we are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit; if the Spirit of God dwell in us, our place and standing are not in the flesh before God.<a name=353:9></a> But note, the Spirit is come down here; it is still man down here, but in Christ and in the Spirit, and that by His Spirit dwelling in him, but that is down here.<a name=353:10></a> If he have not the Spirit, he is not Christ's; but if Christ be in him, for now it is Christ in him, and not he in Christ (compare John 14: 20), the body is dead, a mere lifeless instrument of service; if it lives, it is a spring of sin only, flesh.<a name=353:11></a> But, Christ being in me, who did die, because of it dead, it is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness; for that is what is looked for in this world, and that is what is found in the fruit of the Spirit, the fruit of righteousness, which is by Christ Jesus to the glory and praise of God.<a name=353:12></a> Still we are here, sons of God indeed, and so heirs-joint-heirs with Christ -- but not in the new creation, but in the suffering one, and suffering with it, though that suffering be not worthy to be compared with the glory to be revealed in us.<a name=353:13></a>

		But we suffer, having the Spirit, as taking up these sorrows according to God, and expressing them by groans produced by the Holy Ghost, and understood by God as those of His own Spirit, though in our hearts, even when we do not know what to ask for.<a name=353:14></a> Just as Christ here could groan in sympathy with a suffering creation, and even Himself in the days of His flesh offer up His petitions with strong crying and tears, only not imperfect as we are, in it.<a name=353:15></a> The Spirit is the power of life, the Spirit gives us consciousness of sonship and our joint inheritance with Christ, and the Spirit groans in our hearts, we being such in the sense of all that is around us, we being joined to it as to our body, Christ our life in the inner man, and the Spirit dwelling in us.<a name=353:16></a> We are saved in hope, and know our place in the glory to be revealed, and hence feel the sorrow of our actual position, according to the Spirit of God, according to God Himself.<a name=353:17></a> We are sons and know it, but the sons of God are yet to be manifested.<a name=353:18></a> For the responsible man triumphantly asks, "Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect?<a name=353:19></a>" and knows that nothing can separate him from the love of God in Christ Jesus.<a name=353:20></a> Everything works together in this poor world for the good of those who love God.<a name=353:21></a> Hence the exhortation of the Epistle is to present -- we being thus here -- our bodies a living sacrifice (that is, not in actual death, as Christ).<a name=353:22></a>

		In Ephesians they are sent forth from God to manifest the divine character on earth.<a name=354:1></a> Here they are set forth as actually subsisting men on the earth only set free, and to offer themselves to God as a living sacrifice.<a name=354:2></a> It is the responsible man justified and set free, with a new life in Christ to live to God, reckoning himself dead to sin, as having been baptized to Christ's death, as having died with Him.<a name=354:3></a>

		The Epistle to the Colossians goes farther still.<a name=354:4></a> The believer, indeed, is not seen sitting in heavenly places in Christ.<a name=354:5></a> A hope is laid up for him in heaven, and he is to set his affection on things above, where Christ sits at God's right hand, not on things on the earth.<a name=354:6></a> But he is not only dead with Christ, but risen with Him; he is dead, and his life hid with Christ in God.<a name=354:7></a> When Christ appears, he will appear with Him.<a name=354:8></a>

		And here it is of moment to notice two distinct aspects of man's state, taken up in these epistles.<a name=354:9></a> He is viewed as living in sins and the indulgence of evil, and he is viewed as dead in sins.<a name=354:10></a> It is one and the same state; if he is alive in the sins, he is dead toward God.<a name=354:11></a> In the former case death must come in to deliver, for there is no mending of the flesh; in the latter it is a new creation.<a name=354:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Romans takes up the former view, Ephesians the latter.<a name=355:1></a> The new creation is wholly the purpose of God.<a name=355:2></a> The former, living in sins, is connected with responsibility; the latter has the second Adam risen and glorified for its centre.<a name=355:3></a> The former deals with man as he is; only life is found in the second Man, and so death for the first; for the Second has died and is risen, and become the believer's life.<a name=355:4></a> Colossians practically takes in both as to the state of man; only it does not put him in heavenly places, nor speak of a new creation; it is only we "risen with Christ.<a name=355:5></a>" Hence also the "one body" is alluded to, and they are warned against not holding the Head; but the doctrine of the body is in no way developed, nor the purpose of God revealed.<a name=355:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is important to notice that the death is always the same, for it is Christ's death.<a name=355:7></a> Death there was death.<a name=355:8></a> He died, and therein died to sin once.<a name=355:9></a> That death, ours by faith, is the only death spoken of.<a name=355:10></a> His death as a person who had been alive in this world <i>was</i> His death to sin.<a name=355:11></a> We are dead with Him in Colossians, dead with Him in Romans.<a name=355:12></a> It is death to sin, in Him and in us; only He had none, and we do not literally die but appropriate His death through grace.<a name=355:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in Colossians we are looked at as having lived in sins; chapter 2: 12; chapter 3: 7.<a name=355:14></a> This coincides with Romans.<a name=355:15></a> But (chapter 2: 12; chapter 3: 1) we are also risen with Him, and we are also viewed as having been dead in sins (chapter 2: 13) which so far coincides with Ephesians: only it does not go so far -- not seating us in heavenly places, nor, as I have said, develop the doctrine of the body, nor the purpose of God.<a name=355:16></a> But the being risen with Christ takes the believer himself into a new state.<a name=355:17></a> It is not merely life in Christ.<a name=355:18></a> Christ having come down and borne his sins, coming into his place of death, the sins having been put away and forgiven, he is raised with Him, and thus enters on a new sphere of existence.<a name=355:19></a> He has done with all the elements or principles of this world; he is not to walk as one alive in this world subject to ordinances, as in a religion suited to the flesh; but to have his affections on things above, where Christ sits; he is dead, and his life is hid there, for Christ is his life, though he be not sitting there as yet himself.<a name=355:20></a> Hence he has put off the old man and put on the new, and this is renewed in knowledge -- has his knowledge according to a wholly new sphere of existence, after the image of Him that created him.<a name=355:21></a>

		In Romans then we have the believer alive in Christ in this world; but dead with Christ (chapter 6: 8); and being so dead, dead to sin, as Christ died actually to sin, and is alive to God, and being dead, dead to law also (for law has power over a man as long as he lives), we are to live in newness of life; and shall be in likeness of Christ's resurrection.<a name=356:11></a> He is viewed as a man in his responsibility, as forgiven and justified (this to chapter 5: 11), rejoicing in the hope of glory, in tribulations, and in God Himself; and as regards state and sin in the flesh and law, he has died and is free.<a name=356:12></a> There is no condemnation for him; sin in the flesh was condemned in the sacrifice of Christ.<a name=356:13></a> This is all negative, save that he is free, and has the Spirit of God dwelling in him.<a name=356:14></a> He looks for the redemption of the body, the quickening of his mortal body; for he is yet in this world the responsible man: only he is now to walk in newness of life.<a name=356:15></a>

		In Ephesians we have purpose fully as to ourselves, as to Christ and His place as head <i>over</i> all things, and <i>to</i> the body.<a name=358:1></a> Hence we are only looked at as dead in sins, and there is a new creation.<a name=358:2></a> It begins (after shewing the relationship with God and the Father in which we are placed in Christ, and God's purpose to gather all things together in Him, our joint-heirship with Him, and the earnest of the Spirit till we have the inheritance), (that is, after shewing our calling and inheritance, and dealing for it) with Christ, known first as dead, but raised from death, and set at God's right hand, far above all principalities and powers, and given to be Head over all things to the assembly, the fulness of Him that fills all in all; and us also, once dead in sins, quickened and raised by the same power from that state together with Christ, Jew and Gentile also together, alike by nature children of wrath, and made to sit together in heavenly places in Christ.<a name=358:3></a> It is not, as often remarked, <i>with</i> Him yet, but in Him, for this is operation of power for the accomplishment of purpose, not purpose itself.<a name=358:4></a> We are God's workmanship created again in Christ Jesus.<a name=358:5></a>

		This is simpler than Romans or Colossians, because it is wholly and simply a new creation and our actual state with new life, and flesh is not in question at all.<a name=358:6></a> God is shewing the exceeding riches of His grace in His kindness towards us in Christ Jesus; only, of course, redemption and forgiveness come in.<a name=358:7></a> But, as I have said, there is no death to sin.<a name=358:8></a> I am not at all looked at as a living man here.<a name=358:9></a> The fact is recognized that we once walked in them; but we have put off the old man and put on the new, which, after God, is created in righteousness and true holiness.<a name=358:10></a> In Colossians we are only renewed in knowledge after the image of Him who created us.<a name=358:11></a> We are not born and have not died, but, being dead in sins, have been created in Christ Jesus -- God's workmanship.<a name=358:12></a> Hence, as to conduct, having put off the old man and put on the new, and having been sealed with the Holy Spirit of God for the day of redemption, we are called to be imitators of God as dear children, and shew God's character as Christ did, not to present, as from where we are (as in Romans), our bodies a living sacrifice to God as our intelligent service, but to give ourselves up in love as Christ gave Himself for us to God a sacrifice and offering.<a name=358:13></a> We are to walk in love, one essential name of God manifested in Christ, and walk as children of light; and if unable, Christ, who was the light of the world, will enlighten us.<a name=358:14></a>

		In Galatians, in contrast with legalists, we have the matter viewed from the Christian point of view.<a name=361:11></a> In that very work of the law which Romans owned brought in death, that death is viewed as a sentence judicially executed on me.<a name=361:12></a> I am dead to it by being dead.<a name=361:13></a> But if it had been the direct application of the law to oneself, it would have been condemnation as well as death.<a name=361:14></a> Still the apostle gives it its full effect; he "by law was dead to law.<a name=361:15></a>" The law had judicially killed him.<a name=361:16></a> But this was as alive in the flesh.<a name=361:17></a> But how was this really done?<a name=361:18></a> Christ had been crucified: he had been crucified with Him, nevertheless lived, but not he, the killed Saul, but Christ lived in him.<a name=361:19></a> Thus the law had killed him: he did not exist any more.<a name=361:20></a> But the condemnation did not come in with the death, because it was really in Christ's death.<a name=361:21></a> It had taken place so that the condemnation was all gone, taken by another; and he dead by that which effected it, and Christ now lived in him.<a name=361:22></a> This death the law itself could effect and did; at least it did in the conscience of the renewed man: only it was done in the crucifixion of Christ, that the condemnation might not accompany it.<a name=361:23></a> For death is always my death, but it is thus deliverance from flesh.<a name=361:24></a>

		There is another word in the Galatians we may notice, chapter 6: 14, 15.<a name=362:1></a> This leads us not to the new creation exactly, but that that alone was of any value.<a name=362:2></a> He gloried not in a worldly religion, what the world and self could recognize as done in the flesh; he gloried only in the cross.<a name=362:3></a> This is the shame of it more than death, though death it was, but a death of shame by which the world was put out; that which morally was all his glory, but made an end of every worldly glory.<a name=362:4></a> All that was glorious for him was the world's deepest shame, and where he had been crucified to the world, he looked down at it from that which closed all connection with it.<a name=362:5></a>

		"Dead to the world" is not a scriptural expression simply as such: only we are not, having died to its principles in Christ, recognized as being alive in it.<a name=362:6></a> But it is not like sin, or the law, which, as far as we are concerned, have ceased to exist for us if we have died.<a name=362:7></a> They are either in us ending in death, or that which has ceased to exist for me altogether if I have died.<a name=362:8></a> Not so the world: I have done with it, but have to remain in it and be kept from the evil, and overcome it, as Christ did, as dead to its principles.<a name=362:9></a> It never was "I": sin, or the flesh was; and the law ceased to exist for me when I died, for it had power over me as long as I lived only.<a name=362:10></a> We have died to the world's rudiments, its principles, which were in us; still having died, I do not reckon myself alive in it.<a name=362:11></a> Death is always our death, and that only, whatever it makes us dead to, and this is always in the cross, and we are dead to all He died to there, for we were crucified with Him.<a name=362:12></a> But one thing this passage shews, that there is only the alternative-either fleshly ceremony and legal righteousness, which is none, or a new creation.<a name=362:13></a>

		One thing remains to consider -- the types which relate to this.<a name=363:1></a> If we look at the history of Israel up to the Red Sea, it is in itself entirely complete, for we have actual judgment on the one hand, and complete deliverance on the other; death and judgment on the one hand, and salvation by them on the other; that is, death and judgment for man in rebellion, or in Christ -- delivering by them.<a name=363:2></a> When we come to experimental application, the state we get into by faith in this redemption, we must go farther, and take in the wilderness and Jordan and what followed.<a name=363:3></a> In this aspect the Red Sea begins the Christian course.<a name=363:4></a> The blood of the passover had met God's eye as righteous Judge, and His love can freely and righteously deliver, and they are delivered at the Red Sea.<a name=363:5></a> Christ's death and resurrection are a perfect redemption and deliverance.<a name=363:6></a> "Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed; thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation.<a name=363:7></a>" God has "borne them on eagles' wings, and brought them" to Himself.<a name=363:8></a> In a word, it is redemption, making us thus strangers and pilgrims indeed in this world, bringing us to God Himself.<a name=363:9></a> The wilderness thus becomes the place where God exercises men, and brings out what is in their heart.<a name=363:10></a> (See Deuteronomy 8: 2, 3 and 15, 16.<a name=363:11></a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another part of Christian life (Canaan) is added to this, which, though not at the same moment perhaps in exercise, yet is part of the same life, for the Christian is always in the wilderness, and always in heavenly places in Christ, that is, whoever has the Spirit of Christ dwelling in him.<a name=363:12></a> His intelligent realization is another thing; his enjoyment of it in faithful carrying out still another; but both are his place.<a name=363:13></a> He is sitting in heavenly places in Christ, he is walking on this earth as a pilgrim in the wilderness.<a name=363:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I proceed to consider the type of Jordan and what follows.<a name=363:15></a> Jordan is death, and still Christ's going down into it; but it is not God's rod smiting the sea, so that by that judgment was salvation, and no ark was there.<a name=363:16></a> In Jordan, in this passage of death, the ark goes first, or man could not pass; it is not defence and salvation and deliverance <i>from</i> their Egypt condition, their coming <i>out</i> free, but their going <i>into</i> the place of promise.<a name=363:17></a> It is the same death of Christ, but going down before His sheep, so that, He having taken away its power wholly, they should pass over dryshod; there was no barring river -- the waters were gone -- but an entrance into Canaan, yet an entrance into Canaan, not for rest, but <i>for</i> conflict as Jehovah's host in the good fight of faith against spiritual wickedness in heavenly places.<a name=363:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The ark there is the efficient cause; that is, Christ going into death, but we going down there with Him though after Him; so that it is not His being delivered for my offences, wounded for my transgressions, nor even deliverance from bondage, sin in the flesh condemned on the cross, and I free as to a divinely given title by redemption; but I have gone through death with Him, and am come up out of Jordan into the heavenly places; not Christ dead for what I was, but my dying with Him, yet in His death.<a name=364:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then I eat the old corn of the land, not the manna.<a name=364:2></a> Christ, as food for my pilgrimage and my wants, is not the character He has now, but Christ the food that belongs to the heavenly places.<a name=364:3></a> I sit there as to my title and standing without combat, and then combat to put my foot on and possess all.<a name=364:4></a> There it is that I am circumcised; that is, I have put off the body of the flesh.<a name=364:5></a> The rudiments of the world are done with, the reproach of Egypt is rolled away.<a name=364:6></a> Our <i>politeuma</i> (citizenship) is in heaven; but this does not hinder my running on to attain Christ and the resurrection from among the dead, but the contrary.<a name=364:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Jordan then gives us death <i>with</i> Christ, and coming up out of it, resurrection with Him, as we find it in Colossians.<a name=364:8></a> This introduces us into the heavenly condition personally; then, where they were, they were circumcised, which does not belong to wilderness condition.<a name=364:9></a> There the heart and flesh are tested as down here for flesh is in us.<a name=364:10></a> But once passed the Jordan -- dead and risen in Christ -- there is circumcision -- the putting off the body of the flesh; we have done with Adam, and have put on Christ.<a name=364:11></a> It is "the circumcision of Christ," because it is the true force of that typical rite as we possess it in Him.<a name=364:12></a> We have put off the old man and put on the new.<a name=364:13></a> Then we eat the old corn of the land, do not recognize ourselves in this world, nor know any man after the flesh.<a name=364:14></a> Then we eat the passover; recognize, being circumcised (dead with Christ and that realized), the full force of His death as full of deliverance as well as forgiveness, the close of all connection with Egypt, as Christ in death.<a name=364:15></a> Not now as blood on the doorposts, but as death to all the old scene, as seen of God.<a name=364:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Both the Red Sea and Jordan are Christ's death; but one is deliverance by sins put away and sin condemned in His death; the other, our dying and resurrection with Him.<a name=364:17></a> Ephesian teaching (though connected with this, as to the having put off the old man and put on the new, which is the experimental part of it, that is, our state before God and our sitting in heavenly places in Christ) is not found in the types.<a name=364:18></a> That is a wholly new creation when we were dead.<a name=364:19></a> There is no type of that.<a name=364:20></a> The types give the experimental knowledge of the redemption and deliverance of man.<a name=364:21></a>

		2 Corinthians 4: 10, 11 gives us the practical carrying out of this.<a name=365:1></a> (Compare chapter 1: 8, 9.<a name=365:2></a>) Verses 14-18 take Ephesian ground.<a name=365:3></a> Death is simply death and Christ's death, of which it is expressly said, "<i>In that</i> he died, he died to sin once.<a name=365:4></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I may add another point which comes before us as regards death, both doctrinally and in the experience of the apostle.<a name=365:5></a> In itself death is always simply our being dead with Christ.<a name=365:6></a> Its application or effect may vary.<a name=365:7></a> It always applies to our relationship with God in nature.<a name=365:8></a> But this may be sinful nature in me, so as to be death to sin, or to the law, which was God's measure of conduct or rule of life for us as alive, as children of Adam.<a name=365:9></a> This death too closes; or it may apply to the principles of the world, the system that Satan has formed for the scene of the natural life's development and satisfaction without God.<a name=365:10></a> Of these we have spoken -- and these are the material points, because these are either contrary to God, or that which, applying to man alive in the flesh, brought in death and condemnation; because as God's law it must be such to sinners when brought to bear upon them.<a name=365:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But Christianity is connected with a power, brought into this world of sin, and not belonging to it at all, the power of the Spirit of God, which, besides freeing us from the power of evil as dead in Christ to sin and alive to God, associates us with Christ in the new creation, whether as revealing it in hope, or as setting us in it in Him.<a name=365:12></a> "If any man be in Christ (it is) a new creation.<a name=365:13></a>" There is one to which as such he belongs.<a name=365:14></a> "Old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new, and all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself.<a name=365:15></a>" God has "wrought us," for our "house which is from heaven.<a name=365:16></a>" "We are God's workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained.<a name=365:17></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the old creation has a double aspect: nature as God made it, and natural relationships which as His own creation God maintains the obligation of, and sustains as good; or, on the other hand, as fallen and in an evil state.<a name=366:1></a> Of this last I have spoken.<a name=366:2></a> We are delivered from the power of the evil that is in it.<a name=366:3></a> But while he who condemns creation in itself, and the relationships God Himself formed (as marriage, parental authority, or the like), or resists what He has established in the midst of evil as authorities to repress it, is an enemy of God, and is led by spiritual evil; yet, supposing power and gift and calling from God, a person may live out of all these by the power which connects him with the new creation.<a name=366:4></a> The being in the natural relationships of God's old creation is not evil.<a name=366:5></a> It is very evil to say so.<a name=366:6></a> I do not speak of authorities now -- it involves other questions -- but of natural relationships.<a name=366:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But a man may, as a special vessel of the power of the new creation, be disconnected with the natural relationships of the old.<a name=366:8></a> Paul knew no man after the flesh.<a name=366:9></a> Not that he did not daily need grace, diligence, and even a thorn in the flesh, as others might; but that there was positive power in which he lived above the whole scene through which he moved.<a name=366:10></a> He did not merely live as a Christian, keeping his body under, and, we may say in a general and very full sense, out of the evil which corrupted the old creation; but, as to human relationships, out of the old creation as to his course and walk.<a name=366:11></a> He was before the world exclusively as a minister of God.<a name=366:12></a> But this is a question of power, and even of gift.<a name=366:13></a> It is not unconnected with deadness to the whole scene around; but still it is a matter of power and service.<a name=366:14></a> It was for the gospel's sake to carry out the activities of God's love more undistractedly in the midst of the evil; he insisting carefully on the other as established of God, being good.<a name=366:15></a> A man may live to God in them, acting up to them as of God, though, the power of evil having come in, he has to sit loose to them; 1 Corinthians 7: 29.<a name=366:16></a> He may in a legal way dread them, as not free to God; or he may, as outside of them, if really free, have nothing to say to them, yet recognize them in their place, because he is free.<a name=366:17></a>

		The Lord says, "Woman, what have I to do with thee?<a name=366:18></a>" in His service (John 2: 4), and goes down 12), He and His mother, and His disciples; and on the cross owns her when His service was accomplished, and commits her to the care of the disciple He loved.<a name=366:19></a> He could shew that He could appreciate the beauty of the lilies of the field, love the young man who ran up to Him as lovely in character; though He could not occupy Himself with lilies, and detected the sinful root which governed the young man's heart.<a name=366:20></a> He could take up children and bless them, though fully recognizing they needed One come to save that which was lost.<a name=366:21></a> He could recognize, in a word, what was in nature of God, and manifest what was sin in it, because He was perfectly free from all evil, and it had no power whatever over Him; subject to Mary and Joseph, though conscious He was the Son of the Father.<a name=366:22></a> If we have such a place, it must of course be as dead, because sin is in us; but as free, though watchful, because Christ is our life.<a name=366:23></a>

		JUDGMENT-SEAT OF GOD AND OF CHRIST

	<div class="paragraph">
		I am not aware that this expression, "the judgment-seat of God" or "the judgment-seat of Christ," is found anywhere else than in Romans 14 and 2 Corinthians 5: in the first of these two passages with a view to prevent individual judgments; in the second with a view to provoke to do good.<a name=369:1></a> The subject in itself is one of the most solemn and at the same time most blessed, and this so much the more as we understand it rightly.<a name=369:2></a> I believe that each act of our lives will be manifested then before the tribunal, according as the grace of God and His ways with us in connection with our own acts will be known then.<a name=369:3></a> We read (Romans 14) that "every one of us shall give account of himself to God"; and the word, in this passage, mentions the tribunal in connection with the exhortation to brethren not to judge one another in respect of days, meats, or any other such thing.<a name=369:4></a>

		LETTER ON ORIGINAL SIN
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My Dear Brother, <br>I find in general, that people do not know what they mean by original sin.<a name=371:1></a> Is it a taint, an evil in nature, or a relative state with God?<a name=371:2></a> For instance it is said, By one man's disobedience many were made sinners.<a name=371:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But it is never said, Christ has put away sin in any sense.<a name=371:4></a> He came once in the end of the world to put away sin.<a name=371:5></a> But the result is not yet produced.<a name=371:6></a> Faith knows it is effectual and rejoices.<a name=371:7></a> But the Holy Ghost convicts the world of sin because they believe not in Jesus; so that there they are, sin increased upon them by the death of Christ.<a name=371:8></a> But, I repeat, it is never said Christ has put away sin.<a name=371:9></a> He has done the work that does it, so that in the new heavens and new earth righteousness will dwell.<a name=371:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence my first answer must be the question, What do they mean by original sin?<a name=371:11></a> If it be the nature (as for instance in the thirty-nine Articles), it is not put away at all, but condemned in the cross.<a name=371:12></a> If it be the relationship and standing of the sinner, it is not changed till he believes.<a name=371:13></a> Only the cross is the adequate and glorious ground on which, God being glorified and the blood before His eyes, He can send to every sinner beseeching him to be reconciled; but this proves he is <i>not</i> till he answers to the call.<a name=371:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If it be meant that sins are put away (which is not original sin in any sense), and we remain guilty of unbelief, it is wholly anti-scriptural.<a name=371:15></a> The Lord says, "If ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins"; and Paul, "Let no man deceive you; for because of these things the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience.<a name=371:16></a>" And men are judged according to their works for the deeds done in the body.<a name=371:17></a> Only remember with the vague word "original sin" we must know what they mean.<a name=371:18></a> The text generally, I suppose, applied to it is Romans 5: 19.<a name=371:19></a> But this says nothing as to putting away.<a name=371:20></a> And it is never said Christ has put away sin at all.<a name=371:21></a>

		I cannot answer for letters put in by those who have received them, because the inquiry to which they are an answer may be met most justly by that answer, but does not appear in the answer.<a name=371:25></a> But I have more to say.<a name=371:26></a> Original sin is theology, and not scripture, and the fruit of men's minds, which have not to be explained but refuted as not the expression of God's In this case it has no really ascertained meaning at all.<a name=371:27></a> My explanation of it would be merely my thought; and it is constantly used and said to be put away and used for children's salvation, entirely out of the bounds of scripture; and those who use it do not know what they say or whereof they affirm; and it is very useful for them to know <i>this</i>.<a name=371:28></a>

		Dear Sister, <br>Yes, doubtless, the loss of your dear daughter will be a sorrowful blow and a great gap in your family; but in one way or another I have for a long time accustomed myself to death in Christ; and, as far as Christians are concerned, to my mind it comes with smiles -- in itself a terrible thing, I fully own, but now a gain.<a name=373:1></a> God will have us in the perfect light.<a name=373:2></a> For Christ, because of us, the way of life was through death.<a name=373:3></a> It is not necessarily so for us, because death is completely overcome; but Christ, who has overcome, is there with us, if we have to take that way to get out of evil and defilement, to enter into the light and perfect joy of His presence.<a name=373:4></a> If there is something that has not been settled with God, there may be a painful moment; for the soul must respond to the joy which is prepared for us.<a name=373:5></a> But in itself death is only the unclothing of that which is mortal and the passing of the soul into the light, into the presence of Jesus.<a name=373:6></a> One leaves that which is defiled and in disorder: what a joy that is?<a name=373:7></a> Later on the body will be found again in power and in incorruptible and immortal glory: we have but to wait a little while.<a name=373:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Salute with much affection all your children.<a name=373:9></a> I feel truly for them the loss that they are about to sustain.<a name=373:10></a> Your dear daughter would have been the joy of any family where she might have been found; she is going to be the joy of that of Christ, for we are entitled to say this.<a name=373:11></a> It is a comfort for those who are still journeying here below.<a name=373:12></a> God prepares us for heaven by cutting little by little the ties that still attach us, as children of Adam, to earth.<a name=373:13></a> Christ takes the place of everything; and thus all goes on well and for the better.<a name=373:14></a> May God deign to bless to the whole family this so real sorrow of heart, in which God ever good has mingled with the bitterness of the cup so much of that which is compassionately sparing and gracious.<a name=373:15></a>

		Dear M --, <br>I would have much liked to see you once down here before your departure; but He who directs all things with perfect love has ordered it otherwise.<a name=374:4></a> You go to heaven before me.<a name=374:5></a> Death is not an accident that happens without the will of God; it has no more dominion over us: the risen One holds the keys of it.<a name=374:6></a> How immensely blessed to know that He has won a complete and final victory over death and over all that was against us, so that there is entire deliverance!<a name=374:7></a> We are delivered, save as to the body, out of the scene where evil has its power, and transported where the brightness of God's countenance ever shines in love, where there is light and love only, where God fills the scene according to the favour that He bears to Christ as to the One who has glorified Him in accomplishing redemption, according to the perfections which were shewn forth through that work.<a name=374:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There was a needs be for God to be manifested in these perfections in answer to the work of Christ; it was due that He should respond to the work of Christ in love, in glory, in the expression of the delight that He found in it.<a name=374:9></a> The name of His God and Father in love was unfolded in all its splendour; "Thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns.<a name=374:10></a>" He was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father.<a name=374:11></a> He then declares that name to His brethren, and Christ praises Him in the midst of the congregation.<a name=374:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is where I wanted to bring you by these remarks that might otherwise appear somewhat abstract.<a name=374:13></a> All this favour shines upon you: what God has been for Christ as man, because Christ glorified God as regards sin that dishonoured Him -- what God has been in bringing Christ into His presence in glory, that He is for you, who are the fruit of the travail of His soul.<a name=374:14></a> Think of that, dear sister.<a name=374:15></a> Moreover, Christ has become infinitely dear to us because of what He has done for us.<a name=374:16></a> He gave <i>Himself</i> because He loved unboundedly.<a name=374:17></a> There is nothing in Christ that is not yours; He cannot give more than Himself, and what a gift this is!<a name=374:18></a>

		Dear Sister, <br>So your dear daughter is already in heaven!<a name=376:6></a> I thank you, dear sister, for having given me these particulars.<a name=376:7></a> Not only did I love her very sincerely, but I also see in her so true a picture of the work of the Spirit in connection with her whole life.<a name=376:8></a> When I say "true," I mean that it was not feelings only, such as friends reproduce to enhance the piety of a deceased person, but just what shews a genuine work of God, such as He produces in a soul with the real experiences of that soul.<a name=376:9></a> That is worth much more than a few artificial flowers spread over a grave.<a name=376:10></a> I feel indeed that the death of your dear daughter will make a great gap in her family, for you and for all.<a name=376:11></a> But God disposes of all, and He does all things well.<a name=376:12></a> And she is going to be laid (at least, her mortal remains) by her father.<a name=376:13></a> Well, they will be raised together.<a name=376:14></a> We shall not go much before one another in leaving this world: we shall all be together, blessed be God, when we are raised from the dust.<a name=376:15></a> With pleasure I think of that dear brother, that he will awake where there is no care and no pain.<a name=376:16></a> He will be near his Saviour, then his daughter with him, and then all the rest, on whom the grave has closed and who have disappeared from this troubled scene.<a name=376:17></a>
